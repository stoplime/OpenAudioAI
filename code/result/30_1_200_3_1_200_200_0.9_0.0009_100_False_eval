sentence: 
    it is 11:00 p.m. on the east coast , 8:00 p.m. in san bernardino where investigators are desperately trying to piece together clues to yesterday 's deadly mass shooting .
    this is `` cnn tonight '' .                                              
    i 'm don lemon .                                                  
0 0 this is the face of a mass killer .                                          
0 0 law enforcement sources say syed rizwan farook appears to have been radicalized but they still do n't know why he and his wife slaughtered 14 of his coworkers .  
0 1 this is what we do know right now , the killers had turned their home into what amounts to be a home lab with thousands of rounds of ammunition and
0 0 chillingly , they apparently lived there along with their six-month old daughter .                                  
0 0 i want to turn now to the investigation and some new information that pamela brown is getting for us .                    
0 0 pamela brown , what are your sources telling you tonight about a possible motive in this case ?                        
1 1 well , that is still unclear and what they are hoping for is to get the contents from their electronics and we have learned , don , that were two
0 1 those cellphones are being sent back to the fbi lab in quantico , virginia , if they 're not already there , being analyzed .          
0 0 so they are hoping to get the contents from that .                                      
0 0 and also , we have learned that while investigators found a computer in the home , the hard drive belonging to that computer is missing .        
0 0 so they have to -- investigators have to issue a subpoena for electronics information content from the big providers .                    
0 0 they are waiting on that right now last we heard                                        
0 1 all of this will be crucial because from what evidence investigators are looking at now , there is nothing to indicate a clear-cut motive , as one source i spoke
0 0 there are suspicions , possible indications .                                              
0 1 they could have been radicalized but nothing to substantiate that .                                      
0 0 we know that syed farook had been in touched with terrorism subjects over the last several years but these are people who have not been arrested and there were not
0 1 so there is still a lot to uncover in this investigation .                                    
0 0 i have to tell you , don , officials i 've been speaking with say this is a very unusual case .                
1 1 so this is just the -- what you mentioned about the phone and the hard drive and what have you , that 's the new evidence , right ?  
0 1 that 's all we know about the new evidence that has come in , right ?                            
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 i mean there is also other electronics we heard that they are looking at as well .                          
0 0 but specifically , there were these two damaged cellphones , the hard drive that is missing .                          
1 0 ok .                                                        
1 0 and so this leads investigators to believe clearly they 're trying to hide something here .                            
1 0 ok. let 's talk about him because you are saying , you know , a motive .                          
0 0 i ca n't really figure it out .                                            
0 0 they 're still working on it .                                              
0 0 they have n't ruled out terrorism .                                              
0 1 but he was n't on any terrorist -- terror watch list or anything like that .                            
0 0 what do you know about people he may have been communicating with , pam ?                              
1 1 that 's absolutely right , don .                                              
0 0 so he was n't on a watch list .                                          
0 0 he was n't on their radar which is part of the reason why it 's still so perplexing to investigators right now because they just did n't have anything on
0 0 we have learned that telephonically he was -- syed farook had been in touch with multiple people that the fbi had been investigating for possible ties to international terrorism .
0 0 but i 'm told that these were loose soft connections , that they were n't frequent communication , that they were n't very recent in terms of the last few
0 0 and so , at this point , investigators do n't feel like that is significant .                            
0 0 now , once they learned a little bit more about the communication , that could change .                          
0 0 and of course they are going to want to talk to these people if they have n't already to figure out what the interaction was .        
0 0 but at this point , it has n't been telling or at least telling enough for them to determine whether or not this was terrorism .        
1 0 let 's discuss now some overseas trip that farook took , pamela .

sentence: 
    i asked donald trump repeatedly , will he call on putin to stay out of the election ?                        
    he did not want to go that far .                                          
    and he seemed to be signaling that it will be a new day in the white house if he 's elected president when it comes to this policy with russia
0 0 he declined to say whether he would meet the nato commitment to defend the baltic states against russian aggression .                    
0 0 and he also repeatedly said he did n't have business dealings in russia , but then went on to concede when pressed that , yes , he held a miss
0 0 so clearly , you know , there is a - a signal from donald trump , i think , to the world that if he 's elected president of the
0 0 i think the other bit of interesting news that came out at the very end of this news conference is when donald trump essentially said shame on the people who
0 0 that was the most popular chant at his convention last week .                                    
0 1 and he seemed to say at the real - at the very end of that news conference that he really did not agree with that sentiment at all .

1 0 jim acosta in florida at the press conference that just wrapped up with donald trump .                            
0 0 we have much more of our special coverage of - of what donald trump 's press conference as well as the democratic national convention .          
0 1 we are in philadelphia , pennsylvania .                                              
0 0 much more continues right now with john king .                                          
1 1 welcome to this special edition of inside politics .                                          
0 0 i 'm john king live in philadelphia here for day three of the democratic national convention .                          
0 0 we have a big day and a big night ahead and we also have a big day unfolding already as donald trump , once again , disrupts campaign 2016 .
0 0 here in philadelphia , a big night .                                            
0 0 virginia senator tim kaine speaks after he 's nominated on the vice presidential spot on the democratic ticket .                      
0 0 the current vice president , joe biden , also in the prime time program , as is president obama , here to ask the voters who gave him two big
1 0 but i think that i 've got a pretty clear-eyed sense of both her strength and her weaknesses .                      
0 0 and what i would say would be that this is somebody who knows as much about domestic and foreign policy as anybody .              
1 1 but , before we get to the democrats here in their town of philadelphia , their convention city , the big event by donald trump last hour in florida ,
0 1 and with me here to share their reporting and their insights , molly ball of `` the atlantic , '' cnn 's manu raju , maeve reston and jeff zeleny
0 0 trademark donald trump .                                                    
0 0 he wants to get into the mix .                                            
0 0 not only get into the mix , though , a lot of remarkable things he just said this past hour in florida as he campaigns in a key battleground state
0 0 one of the big dramas here , they 're calling it spy games at the democratic convention .                        
0 0 the dnc , the democratic national committee 's e-mail system was hacked , embarrassing e-mails released , it 's caused tension with bernie sanders .          
0 0 we 'll get to that later .                                              
0 0 but the question is , who did it ?                                          
0 0 and increasingly the justice department says it looks like russia did this .                                  
0 0 the fingerprints in the metadata and all that .                                          
0 0 and the accusation has been , is vladimir putin somehow trying to help donald trump ?                            
0 0 at this news conference in florida last hour , trump repeatedly denied any coordination , any business dealings with russia , any reason that the russia would be trying to
0 0 but listen to donald trump here , a candidate for president of the united states .                            
0 0 remember , hillary clinton deleted some e-mails .                                            
0 1 they 're missing .                                                    
0 0 they have n't been recovered yet .                                              
0 0 donald trump says right here , he hopes russia has 33,000 e-mails deleted from hillary clinton 's private e-mail server .                  
1 1 russia , if you 're listening , i hope you 're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing .                  
0 0 i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press .                                    
1 0 i get the mischief back to here .                                            
0 0 if you 're a private citizen , and you want to embarrass hillary clinton .                              
0 0 but he wants to be president of the united states .                                      
0 0 this is potentially a state actor , the government of russia , hacking into an american political party , to meddle in a political campaign for whatever reason , and
1 0 it may -                                                      
1 1 if you let that soak in , that is amazing .                                      
0 0 i mean this is a - the point where a presidential campaign becomes serious .                              
0 0 both of these nominees will soon be getting intelligence briefings .                                      
0 0 they are the president in waiting .                                              
0 0 and to have a nominee say he hopes russia has access to these - and these are n't just like play e-mails .              
0 0 these are from the state department .                                              
0 0 i think that is extraordinary .                                                
0 0 he 'll have to address that again .                                            
0 0 and his running mate , mike pence , is saying quite the opposite .                                
1 1 yes , that was a remarkable part , that pence took a much firmer line than donald trump .                      
0 0 he released a statement afterwards saying that we will get to the bottom of this .                            
0 0 this is very serious , the national security issue , sounding a lot like hillary clinton did this morning when her aides came out and said that this is a
0 0 so , clearly , trump and his running mate are off message on this major national security issue .                      
1 0 and this is the kind of thing where , you know , the voters that have issues with him , and thinking that he 's impulsive and not thinking through
0 0 and i also thought it was so interesting because he sounded , throughout the press conference , it was very repetitive , but sounded pretty defensive about what 's been
0 0 so he 's got a very fine line to walk here and hillary clinton 's campaign clearly will try to expose that .              
1 1 well , but what we 've seen is whenever there 's a fine line , trump tramples all over it , right ?              
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 sure .                                                        
1 1 he does n't really believe in - in fine lines .                                      
0 0 i mean you know the nominee has issues when his own running mate is distancing himself from - from his position .                
0 0 the right thing , probably , for trump to be doing here , would be to paint all the russia stuff as a conspiracy theory , distance himself from that
0 0 this does the opposite .                                                  
0 0 he is not exactly bending over backwards to distance himself from the russia angle on all of this .                      
0 0 he 's publicly seeming to collude with russia .                                          
1 0 and let 's be clear , this is an issue that will probably continue to play out for the next several months of this campaign because we 're expecting ,
0 0 so if more e-mails come out , and trump is sort of cheering that , it does n't look good for him , even if it may help him politically
1 1 but it 's also -                                                  
1 1 he kept saying - sorry .                                                
0 0 he kept saying , you know , throughout the press conference , i do n't know putin .                        
0 1 i know he 's called me a genius , but i have nothing to do with russia .                        
0 0 so there was sort of a little bit of defense mixed in there .                                
0 0 zeleny : they 're also blending two things here .                                        
0 0 those 30,000 e-mails                                                      
0 0 he 's talking about are from the state department , from her private server .                              
0 0 and there is no conclusive evidence that that server was hacked .                                    
0 0 the hacked e-mails are from the democratic national committee .                                        
0 0 so he is - he is blending those issues .                                        
0 0 potentially her e-mails were venerable to outside actors , but we do n't know that for sure .                        
0 0 we know the ones that were hacked were from the dnc .                                    
0 0 so he is kind of merging this and blending it into one big controversy .                              
0 0 but a controversy all the same here on both sides now .                                    
1 1 right , a potential president of the united states saying essentially i hope - i hope they did this because i 'd like to see them and the press would
0 0 watch how this plays out .                                                
0 0 but trump thinks this plays into something .                                            
0 0 another thing he said last night is trump - donald trump was watching last night .                            
0 0 history was made here in philadelphia yesterday .                                            
0 0 hillary clinton is the first major party candidate for president who 's a woman in the united states .                      
0 0 she hopes to shatter the next glass ceiling and be the first woman president of the united states .                      
0 1 donald trump was asked the question , he says , that would be great , just not this woman , he says .              
1 0 i would love to see a woman become president of the united states , but she would be so wrong .                  
0 0 and even woman say that .                                                
0 0 women do n't like her .                                                
0 1 she would be so wrong .                                                
0 0 look , hillary clinton is a disaster .                                            
0 0 she 's been a disaster .                                                
0 0 and even the story told by her husband last night , he left out the most interesting chapter .                      
0 0 i wo n't get into that .                                              
0 0 the chapter that i really waited for , because it was pretty boring , the chapter that i waited for , i never heard .          
0 0 and he left it out .                                                
1 1 again , trademark trump .                                                  
0 0 hillary clinton will be a disaster , and in his very personal testimony , in support of his wife last night , trump making the case he left out a
0 0 we all know which chapter that is .                                            
0 0 that 's the monica lewinsky , the infidelity chapter .                                        
0 0 he says he wants a woman president , just not this one .                                  
1 0 you know , i mean , when you do talk to a lot of voters , there are some republican women and other women who say the same thing .
1 1 true .                                                        
1 0 and other women i 've talked to at bernie sanders rallies throughout the past year , you ask them , are n't you drawn at all by the historic nature
0 0 some say , no , i 'm not drawn by the gender at all .                              
0 0 so the gender here , which is becoming , last night was an historic day , regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on , what your political
0 0 the campaign is deciding to double-down on it .                                          
0 0 and i think , in the end , that 's what they need to build the coalition -                        
1 1 especially among younger women , too .                                              
0 0 those are -                                                      
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 because a lot of young women believe that sometime in their lifetime there will be a female president .                      
0 0 but older women , hillary does better with because they 've been waiting for this moment all along .                      
1 0 but it will be so interesting to watch how that audience reacts to the convention this week and the doubling down that jeff is talking about because so many of
0 0 maybe jill stein , green party , et cetera , because of trust issues .                              
1 0 let 's -                                                      
1 1 so but it was interesting in - also in his press conference today how trump on the - right before obama speaks tonight and biden was going on and on
0 0 she 's not a change maker , trying to directly , you know , conflict with what bill clinton 's speech was about last night .        
1 0 he also said that president obama was the most ignorant president we 've ever had .                            
0 0 and that , in his view , hillary clinton would be even worse .                                
0 1 tough words about the president .                                                
0 0 personal attacks on the president of the united states .                                        
0 0 another issue that came up , and , again , we 're getting some mixed signal here .                        
0 0 paul manafort , the trump campaign chairman , is quoted today by the cbs `` marketwatch '' as saying donald trump will not release his tax returns .    
0 0 listen to donald trump here at this news conference .                                        
0 0 he has repeatedly been pressed .                                                
0 0 the standard for most presidential nominees , dating back to richard nixon , has been , once you get the nomination , you get close to the nomination , you
0 0 donald trump has not done so .                                              
0 0 listen to him here .                                                  
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 .                                                          
1 1 i do n't know .                                                  
0 1 it depends on the audit .                                                
0 0 it depends on the audit .                                                
0 0 not a big deal .                                                  
0 0 by the way , just so you understand , i 've released my papers , 104 pages of documents .                    
0 0 i built an unbelievable company .                                                
0 0 tremendous cash .                                                      
0 1 tremendous company , with some of the great assets of the world .                                  
0 0 you 've seen it .                                                  
0 0 you were all very disappointed when you saw it , actually , but that 's ok. far - far greater than anybody ever thought .          
0 0 i have a great company .                                                
0 0 i built an unbelievable company .                                                
0 0 but if you look there , you 'll see there 's nothing in russia .                              
0 0 and as far as the tax returns , as soon as the audit 's complete .                            
1 0 this is his pivot every time .                                              
0 0 i filed the required financial disclosure form with the government .                                      
0 0 you heard him work in there , you 'll see there 's nothing in russia .                            
0 0 some people have tried to suggests maybe this whole e-mail hack and leak has something to do with , he has russian business interests or something .      
0 0 he says there 's nothing there .                                              
0 0 but we do n't know that .                                              
0 0 it 's not just - donald trump says i 've released my financial disclosure form .                            
0 1 that does tell us something about his finances .                                          
0 1 but it does n't tell us -                                              
1 1 it tells us what he wants .                                              
1 1 it tells us what - what he has to tell us .                                    
0 0 it does n't tell us what tax rate he paid , what loopholes he takes advantage of , whether he puts - shelters money , perfectly legal perhaps , but
0 0 whether he takes advantage of all these real estate tax credits that allow you to , you know , depreciate and essentially not pay the government - not pay the
1 0 well , and that -                                                  
1 1 and how that actually work , too .                                            
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 i think that trump has clearly calculated that whatever 's in his tax returns is much more damaging than taking the hit for not being transparent and -    
1 1 that 's exactly right .                                                  
0 1 there 's no legal requirement that presidential nominees release their tax returns , but there 's a widespread public expectation .                  
0 0 and you see in polls that a vast majority of americans , republicans and democrats alike , believe that he should release the tax returns , believe they are entitled
0 0 when you do n't release the information , you know , maybe you do n't disclose those things , but you open yourself up to all of this speculation .
0 0 you open yourself up to all of the wondering of , well , what is in there that is so bad that he wo n't let us see it .
0 0 and so that 's going to be a steady drum beat .                                    
0 0 that 's going to continue .                                                
0 0 the clinton campaign is going to drive this message and that 's going to be the big question hanging over , his financials .            
1 0 the question is , does it matter though ?                                          
0 1 among his supporters , no , i mean , because this is - this was an issue in the primary and it continues .            
0 0 among voters in the middle i think who are still not sure about him , i think it does matter .                  
0 0 among his supporters , absolutely not .                                              
1 0 all right , everybody , sit tight .                                            
0 0 we 're at the democratic national convention talking a lot about the republican nominee donald trump because , once again , he has jumped in , try to counterprogram ,
0 1 but when we come back , back to the democrats .                                      
0 0 a big speech tonight at the dnc from the current commander in chief and we 'll look back last night too .                
0 0 former president bill clinton making a very personal testimony about his wife and making history .                            
0 0 stay with us .                                                    
0 1 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 that 's the convention hall here in philadelphia .                                          
0 0 lenny kravitz doing his walkthrough .                                                
0 0 he 'll be one of the many performers here for the democratic convention .                                
0 0 it is day three .                                                  
0 0 we 're at the halfway mark .                                              
0 0 lenny kravitz tuning the guitar there in the hall .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton is now officially the democratic nominee .                                          
0 0 and her first appearance in the convention hall came last night after a video reminders all 44 presidents so far , from george washington to barack obama , have been
0 0 that dramatic effect there , the presentation came shortly after the day two closer , bill clinton .                        
1 0 so people say , well , we need to change .                                      
0 0 she 's been around a longtime .                                              
0 0 she sure has .                                                    
0 0 and she 's sure been worth every single year she 's put into making people 's lives better .                      
1 0 a very personal speech from bill clinton last night .                                        
0 0 he started with first meeting her back in the early 1970s at yale , went through their courtship , went through her life of service and change .    
0 1 and bill clinton , listen here , trying to make the point that when you watch the republicans talk about hillary clinton , in his view , it 's all
1 0 and , if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch , let me just say , i may become the first woman president ,
0 0 thank you , all .                                                  
0 0 i ca n't wait to join you in philadelphia !                                        
0 0 thank you !                                                      
1 1 all right , we 'll get back to bill clinton in a minute .                                
0 0 a little out of order there .                                              
0 0 but , hillary clinton , that 's the first time she 's spoken to the convention .                          
0 0 number one , she 's been much more traditional .                                        
0 0 donald trump was around all the time at his convention .                                      
0 0 it 's much more traditional .                                                
0 0 all right , hillary clinton appearing by video .                                          
0 0 it looks very tight , as if she 's alone in the room .                                
0 0 and then as she finishes , it pulls out to the little girls .                                
0 1 so different from 2008 when she did not emphasize this .                                      
0 0 she 's trying to play this card and play it hard .                                    
1 1 well , in 2008 , also she was not the nominee -                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so she did not have the opportunity to play a video with shattered glass at the democratic convention .                      
0 1 but , no , we certainly have , as jeff was saying before , seen hillary lean very hard into the - what trump calls the woman card .  
0 0 the selection we - you saw in that video , it definitely resonated with the people in that room .                    
0 0 a lot of women , a lot of delegates on that floor openly , you know , weeping and very emotional .                
0 1 a lot of the democratic party was built on some of the feminist movement from the '60s and '70s , the modern democratic party .          
0 0 so for these people , it 's a very poignant sort of homecoming .                                
0 0 you know , as we saw in the primary , this message did not resonate as much as hillary clinton expected it to .            
0 0 it really did not move a lot of especially younger women .                                    
0 0 and her campaign realizes that and may deemphasize it going forward .                                    
0 0 i think the other side of that coin is that trump is very disliked by women voters .                        
0 0 and so it will be interesting to see whether those sort of independent women voters view this as overly polarizing by hillary , or whether trump 's comments , you
1 1 it is interesting also this week that , you know , that they are playing this card so hard because this is the moment to do it , right ?
0 0 this is one of the moments when she needs to get all of those democrats really excited about her campaign .                  
0 0 but one of the biggest problems that she has is with white men , right ?                            
0 0 so as we go into the fall campaign , you know , if they were to continue to just pound this message over and over again , that could potentially
1 1 and to that point , it 's interesting to hear her earlier this week when she talked to the veterans of foreign wars saying that , you know -  
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 some of you may be concerned about a woman being commander in chief .                                
0 0 so what is today 's theme of this convention ?                                        
0 1 is to talk about her credentials being someone who can handle the country 's military , national security issues , foreign policy , being tough on national security .  
0 0 so , clearly , they recognize there 's a little bit of a risk politically if they overplayed their hand on the gender issue .          
0 0 king : part of bill clinton 's job , and , again , the personal story was very moving , how they met .            
0 0 bill clinton gave a very disciplined speech for bill clinton .                                      
0 0 the word `` i '' did n't pop in there that much , except saying i met her , i did this with her , was to counter the republican
0 0 donald trump calls her crooked hillary .                                              
0 0 he started in recent days , her middle - her maiden name is rodham .                              
0 0 calls her hillary rotten clinton .                                                
0 0 bill clinton tried to make the case that the republicans were essentially afraid of his wife and creating someone who does n't exist .            
1 0 how does this square ?                                                  
0 1 how does this square with the things that you heard at the republican convention ?                              
0 0 what 's the difference in what i told you and what they said ?                                
0 0 how do you square it ?                                                
0 0 you ca n't .                                                    
0 0 one is real .                                                    
0 1 the other is made up .                                                
0 0 the real one had done more positive change making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office              
1 0 there 's nobody like him .                                                
0 0 he 's the premiere politician of his generation .                                          
0 0 he 's the premiere explainer .                                                
0 0 even the obama people will tell you , he did a great job for them in 2012 .                        
0 0 this is a needle he 's trying thread here .                                        
0 0 that somebody you have seen in public life for two or three decades can effect change .                          
0 0 can be somebody who changes government , brings newness to government , brings solutions to government , at a time when people are very frustrated and trump plays up ,
1 0 i think that was the most effective theme of his address last night .                                
0 0 a lot of democrat in hall i talked to afterward were hoping for a fulsome speech like he gave for president obama in 2012 .          
0 0 really an explainer of why .                                                
0 0 some were hoping that he would have focused all of it on change last night , as opposed to kind of the awkward biography .          
0 0 he 's not her biographer .                                                
0 0 and the reality is , he left out the 1990s , as we talked about .                            
0 0 so that kind of plays in there .                                            
0 0 but he is trying to show that she has been at this for a while and it 's not all about her .              
0 0 but on him making the argument that it 's a change election .                                  
0 0 no one knows better than bill clinton .                                            
0 0 he reads the mood of this country .                                            
0 0 he reads the mood of the electorate .                                            
0 0 he knows that donald trump has tapped into something .                                        
0 0 and bill clinton was one of the first people early on , almost a year ago , nine months or so ago , who said , do not take donald
0 0 so that is going to be his argument .                                          
0 0 the problem is , change maker is not exactly a smooth and sexy term .                              
0 0 it sort of sounds like a machine at the car wash. you put a five in and get change out to buy a car wash .        
1 0 a cnn car wash. nice .                                                
1 0 and how do you paint yourself a change maker but president obama is speaking on your behalf and essentially you would continue most of president - if not all of
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and you saw , you saw trump come back at exactly that point this morning in the - in the press conference saying , she 's been there 30 years
0 0 how could she possibly be a change maker ?                                          
0 0 she 's just an extension of obama .                                            
0 0 and that 's going to be something that 's really interesting to watch for tonight in the president 's speech because he 's also threading a needle there , too
0 0 but i did think that bill clinton was able to humanize his wife and talk about aspects of her biography that really are not familiar to a lot of the
0 0 and particularly for those voters who are n't sure about donald trump but has some trust issues with her , learning about that hillary , early hillary in the long
1 1 who do n't know about her volunteer working with - for children in hospitals back in college .                        
0 0 we 'll see how that works up .                                            
0 0 perfect segue .                                                      
0 0 you mentioned the president coming up , the speech tonight from president obama .                                
0 0 we 'll give you a sense of what he 's about to say about hillary clinton and what he 's thinking about donald trump .          
0 0 that 's next .

sentence: 
    president obama asked congress for new war powers but promises there will be limits .                              
    i 'm convinced that the united states should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the middle east .                
    many liberals do n't trust that promise and some republicans say it 's one the president ca n't keep if he wants true victory .          
1 0 he continues to look at this as a counterterrorism effort when , in fact , there 's a war underway .                  
1 0 what do the 2016 republican contenders think ?                                            
1 0 you see the president taking vows saying that he has terrorism on the run .                              
1 1 oh , maybe they should just stop going to london .                                      
1 0 i 'm going to punt on that one as well .                                      
1 0 vaccines , no doubt , are a presidential issue .                                        
0 0 is evolution ?

0 0 welcome to inside politics .                                                  
0 0 i 'm john king .                                                  
0 0 thanks for sharing your sunday morning .                                              
1 1 julie pace of the associated press , cnn 's peter hamby , `` the atlantic 's '' molly ball and jonathan martin of the `` new york times '' .
0 0 it was a remarkable picture last week .                                            
0 0 take a peek .                                                    
0 0 president obama and the top members of his national security team , four former senators all of whose careers anchored by anti-war thinking .            
0 0 there they are -- - side by side .                                          
0 0 even more remarkable , they were there because the president-elected on a promise to end two exhausting costly overseas war asking congress for new war-making authority in the middle east
1 0 i 'm optimistic that it can win strong bipartisan support and that we can show our troops and the world that americans are united in this mission .    
1 0 so far though , despite the president 's request , there 's bipartisan skepticism .                              
0 0 liberals complaining the request lacks the iron-clad promise against mission creek and ground troops .                              
0 0 conservatives complain the president 's approach in both words and in deeds just is n't tough enough , they say , to destroy the islamic state .      
1 0 the fact of the matter is that for the past six years the administration 's consistent dithering has made the world less , not more safe .      
1 1 julia pace , sometimes in washington if both sides are mad , that means you 've found a sweet spot -- the middle .            
0 0 but not so clear in this case because now you have to put language which congress has to pass something .                  
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
0 1 i think it says a lot about where we are right now that people at the white house that i talk to are just happy that there are very few
0 0 you have republicans who disagree with this piece of legislation for one reason , democrats who disagree for a totally another reason .              
0 0 how you bridge that divide i think is going to be very difficult .                                
0 0 no one is going to end up with something that they like .                                  
0 0 it 's just a matter of where the white house decides to move on this .                            
0 0 do they want to tighten up the language , make it more restrictive or do they want to move towards republicans and leave it somewhat open-ended ; something that again
1 1 that 's a really good point .                                              
0 1 the loudest critics of this so far are the democrats who have been calling for this for a long time , like tim kaine for example .      
0 0 and then the hawks in the republican party , the sort of the , you know , devout partisans .                    
0 0 and in the middle it leaves a lot of room to figure out where we want to go .                      
1 0 in a way the president has sort of called the congress ' bluff , right ?                            
0 0 because congress has been saying since this action began , wait a second , we want a say in this but for different reasons .          
0 0 democrats wanted to say in order to limit it .                                        
0 0 republicans wanted to say in order to expand the mandate .                                      
0 0 and so the white house is saying , fine , see what you can do since you want to weigh in so badly .            
0 1 and perhaps it will be most effective as a sort of reverse psychology since now that they 've given congress what they said they wanted , congress does n't seem
1 1 the dog has fallen off the cart here .                                          
1 1 exactly .                                                        
1 1 but i think the bigger picture point here that 's important is it does seem like that congress at least has the opportunity now to assert itself in war-making policy
0 0 so i think for those of us who are fans of government , i think that that is a promising development .                
0 1 the other point that i would make on this is that there are some escape hatches on this .                      
0 0 this is not that tight of a resolution .                                          
0 0 i think if you look at it , it will undo the '02 resolution that ok 'd the iraq war but not the '01 resolution after the 9/11 attacks that
1 1 it says al qaeda and its affiliates , which you can define loosely and the commander-in-chief -- but that 's one of the complaints .          
0 0 republicans say we want more specificity on what you will do , not what you wo n't do .                      
0 0 they want to know -- define the enemy more clearly , define the mission .                              
0 0 there -- some of them want to leave open specifically let 's do ground troops if we deem that necessary .                  
0 1 and then on the left you have wait a minute , this language is a little vague .                        
0 0 and you do n't take away 2001 .                                            
0 0 so essentially you 're asking us to pass something but then you can do -- you or your successor can do whatever you want .          
1 0 and i think what 's really interesting about this , the biggest escape hatch is that obama is currently acting under the 2002 resolution .          
0 0 he can continue to do that .                                              
0 0 now , the 2002 resolution , as we all remember , is the resolution that hillary clinton voted for and that obama opposed and said that was the big distinction
0 0 it is amazing to think that this president is going to act under a resolution that he essentially won the democratic nomination for .            
1 0 and to your point , to your point about the 2002 debate , anybody who wants to run for higher office or keep running for office has to be mindful
0 0 and so what happens to 2016 ?                                              
0 0 we 'll watch elizabeth warren , we 'll watch bernie sanders .                                    
0 0 but importantly , nothing against them but hillary clinton seems to have a bit of a lead over them .                    
0 0 there 's a more interesting republican race .                                            
0 0 listen to rand paul here saying -- he says the president has it all wrong .                            
0 0 this is part of his solution .                                              
1 0 i think the only way this battle ultimately is won is with troops on the ground .                          
0 0 but they need to be arab troops .                                            
0 0 they need to be iraqis .                                                
0 0 they need to be kurds .                                                
1 0 are n't there iraqis and kurds ?                                              
0 0 is n't that 's what 's happening inside iraq ?                                        
0 1 am i missing something ?                                                  
1 1 he 's not saying a lot .                                              
0 0 i mean really no one has said much specific last week as this rolled out .                            
0 0 marco rubio was perhaps the most specific saying , you know , it 's unprecedented for a president to try to limit himself and he would want to get rid
0 0 ted cruz asked for something in there about arming the kurds which is again something the u.s. is already doing .                  
0 0 so you 're seeing these potential candidates really trying to feel out the ground but not a lot of specifics .                  
1 0 before you jump in , let 's just bring ted cruz into the equation because some republicans seem to think that if the president just talked about this differently it
1 0 when you have an administration that will not utter the words `` radical islamic terrorists '' , you have an administration that is unwilling to effectively design and implement a
1 1 i get the argument and it 's a fair debating point .                                    
0 1 without taking sides , should the president be more aggressive in his description of the enemy ?                          
0 0 ted cruz -- radical islamic terrorists -- he said it twice it there in a sentence .                          
0 0 but if the president of the united states came out tomorrow and said a million times `` radical islamic terrorists '' , does anyone think isis would surrender ?  
1 0 does anyone thing ted cruz would change his opposition to anything the president says , you know ?                        
1 0 but i think what we 're seeing , you know , is that these issues , foreign policy issues , are going to be a much bigger deal in 2016
0 0 they already are .                                                    
0 0 and how tricky this ground is for rand paul because he does not have a lot of company there in that noninterventionist wing in the primaries .      
0 0 we could see a replay of those 2012 debates where ron paul was all alone on the stage getting attacked from all sides by a republican party that other than
1 0 and my question is can they get away with just saying this president is getting it wrong without being specific about things they would clearly do different ?    
0 0 not just in their words .                                                
1 0 it 's hard to see that .                                              
0 0 and that 's sort of one reason that you saw marco rubio step out a little bit this week and say that i know more about this stuff than any
1 0 just as a practical matter , this resolution that obama wants them to vote on is for three years .                    
0 0 that takes them into the next presidency .                                            
0 0 so if you are running for president this is something that you would be saddled with .                          
0 0 you 're going to have to take a stand on this one way or the other .                          
1 0 you want to be president , just being critical is n't good enough and we should note we did n't talk about it here -- jeb bush has a big
0 0 we 'll watch what he says about this and other issues as well .                                
0 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 next , call it the london curse .                                            
0 0 republican presidential contenders cross the pond hoping to make a splash and instead make a mess .                          
0 0 but first , politicians say or do the darnedest things .                                      
0 0 can you say february and yolo .                                              
1 0 the deadline for signing up for health insurance is february -- that 's not right .                            
0 0 man , february 15th .                                                  
0 0 thanks , obama .                                                    
0 0 that 's pretty good .                                                  
1 0 welcome back , if you 're a sports fan you 've no doubt heard of the sports illustrated curse .                    
0 0 appear on the cover , celebrate and then brace for the worse .                                  
0 0 way back in the day evel knievel on the cover -- his canyon jump did n't go so well .                    
0 0 lindsey vonn on the here -- yes she 's won gold medals but not long after this , she suffered a big injury .            
0 0 tim tebow -- this is when he was a rising star with the denver broncos , he 's no longer in the nfl , let 's just leave it there
0 1 in presidential politics now , we 're talking about something called the london curse .                              
0 0 republican presidential candidates , they go across the pond , they 're hoping to make a foreign policy good impression .                  
0 0 chris christie stumbled on the vaccine question .                                            
1 0 all i can say is we vaccinated ours but i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that 's the balance
1 1 about a month earlier , louisiana governor , bobby jindal -- the london mayor says this is not only wrong , he says it 's ridiculous .      
1 1 you need to have proper sort of facts to back that up .                                  
0 0 i have lived here a long time , i do n't know of any no-go zones .                          
1 0 well , there are people here in london that will tell you that our neighbors where the women do n't feel safe , walking through those neighborhoods without veils .
0 0 there are neighborhoods where the police are less likely to go .                                    
0 1 that 's a danger --                                                  
1 1 the no-go zone debate will continue .                                              
0 1 and just this past week , the wisconsin governor scott walker asked this question and using a football metaphor , punting .                
1 0 are you comfortable with the idea of evolution ?                                          
0 1 do you believe in it ?                                                
0 0 do you accept it ?                                                  
1 1 for me , i 'm going to punt on that one as well .                                
1 0 no , really ?                                                    
1 0 that 's a question a politician should n't be involved in one way or the other .                          
0 0 i 'm going to leave that up to you .                                        
1 0 is that jonathan martin , a question a politician should n't be involved with one way or another ?                      
0 0 especially a republican politician who 's trying to court the evangelical base in iowa and then be a general election candidate ?                
1 0 the answer to that question john came about a half an hour after he said that on twitter .                      
0 0 he came down squarely on the side of if not creationism , some kind of divine role in man 's presence and so i think he figured out that he
0 0 i do n't quite get why these folks are going over to london except for they want to raise money from american expatriates .            
1 0 i do n't either .                                                  
0 0 this is one i do n't understand .                                            
1 0 there are some bankers over there .                                              
1 0 there 's a money thing , right , from ex-pats .                                      
0 0 there 's a sort of notional idea that they 're going to build up their foreign policy credentials which is actually kind of silly ; a trade mission is going
0 0 but if you 're a republican , if you have any sort of half interest in politics , you know that english people , there 's nothing they like to
0 0 if you 're sitting down with a british interviewer , he 's going to ask you about evolution and abortion and sarah palin and you have to be ready to
1 0 particularly if you are coming over with not much of an agenda like a trade mission .                          
1 0 romney 's challenge too , by the way , in 2012 he had nothing to say when he was over there .                
0 0 and a lot of these politicians adhere to the rule that politics stops at the water 's edge .                      
0 1 and that when you 're across the see , then you do n't criticize american foreign policy on foreign soil and so i think he was sort of hemmed in
0 0 but you 're right , you 've got to have something to say .                                
1 1 that 's also not controversial .                                                
0 0 you answer most americans sort of believe in evolution either god only or guided --                              
1 1 is it a fair presidential question , evolution ?                                          
0 1 he 's a governor so he has to deal with what 's in textbooks .                              
0 0 presidents do n't have to deal with what 's in textbooks .                                    
0 0 sometimes governors do , school committees do and states do -- creationism , evolution , your text book .                      
0 0 your views on stem cell research , this could be important to you .                                
1 1 well , i think it 's a question that voters care about one                                  
0 0 way or the other .                                                  
0 0 and you can be more deft in the way that you answer it whether the way you answer it is to deflect it or get into a serious discussion of
0 0 this is the beginning of the presidential cycle and so they 're still getting their feet wet , so to speak .                
0 0 they 're still getting used to these kinds of uncontrolled situations and we see some candidates who have n't been on that big stage that much before and are getting
1 1 here 's the irony , some sort of notebook stuff here , john , that you 'll appreciate .                      
0 0 the walker folks did not want a lot of press attention on this trip .                              
0 0 in fact , they saw what happened with christie and they really worked to limit the availability of walker while he was over there .          
0 0 this was the only public event he had .                                          
0 0 it happened to be live streaming .                                              
0 0 he was fin the entire event .                                              
0 0 it was not until that last question that he got tripped up .                                  
0 0 you know , they saw the christie example and they worked to avoid press attention at all but he did one event .              
1 0 he 's getting more scrutiny right now because what goes up in politics gets more scrutiny .                          
0 0 he 's gone up in the iowa , up in the new hampshire polls , up in the national republican political conversation .              
0 0 and i will , the `` boston globe '' and `` washington post '' -- both doing stories everybody at this table knows but a lot of american voters might
0 1 scott walker never graduated from college .                                              
0 0 does that matter ?                                                    
0 0 pro or con ; plus or minus ?                                            
1 0 i think it depends on how he explains it to the public or what the story is behind it .                    
0 0 actually it is a kind of confusing story .                                          
0 0 i do n't think that a lot of americans would say it completely disqualifies him .                            
0 0 but i do think , that you know , you 're running to be the president of united states , we talk about college education as a qualification for a
0 0 i think there may be some people who say a president should be one of them .                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 and you know , i think it 's a net negative only because there 's nothing positive about it .                    
0 0 i do n't think there 's a lot of voters who are going to look at him and say , working class hero , good for you not going to
0 0 therefore , those who do care about it , it 's going to be in a negative sense .                      
0 0 is it going to be a deal breaker for a lot of people ?                                
0 0 probably not .                                                      
0 0 but some thing i have heard from some republicans out there is they wonder why he never went back and finished .                
0 0 he 's had a lot of time now and it becomes a commitment --                                
1 0 he 's going to have to explain that .                                          
0 0 a lot of people who have been elected and re-elected think i have answered all f the biographical questions .                    
0 1 everybody knows everything about me .                                                
0 0 when you run for president , it 's completely different .                                      
0 0 we learned about george w. bush 's dui late in the campaign .                                  
0 0 he 's going to have answer , why .                                          
0 0 but is n't it also risky for the democrats to try to make an issue of it ?                        
0 0 maybe an individual voter might say it bothers me .                                        
0 1 another voter might say , that 's fine , i did n't graduate college .                              
1 0 he 'll love that , right .                                              
1 1 that 's exactly what it is .                                              
0 0 he 's self-styled mr. authenticity .                                                
0 0 he brings a packed lunch to the office every day , sits in the stands at lambeau .                        
0 0 he 'll use that to attack the liberal media and democrats and use that as a sort of foil .                    
1 1 he buys his clothes off the rack .                                            
1 0 these cultural elites do n't get working class america .                                        
1 0 do you go to kohl 's , peter , for your coats and jackets ?                              
1 0 not lately .                                                      
1 0 remember not in a public way , but remember democrats under the radar and under their breaths and in the blogosphere tried , even though he went to yale and
0 0 and i think he served two terms as president right .                                      
1 1 rand paul also did n't graduate from college .                                          
0 0 he did n't go into medical school .                                            
1 0 your point that was right is that transparency i think is the best solution for walker here .                        
0 0 he 's going to have to come out and do an interview or some kind of a , you know , availability , explaining what actually happened , but also
0 0 i think that will be a fascinating thing that could diffuse some of those .                              
1 0 friends say in college at that time he said he had a job opportunity , he needed to take it .                  
0 0 if he wants to be president of the united states , he 's going to have to go through this again .                
0 0 and trust me , governor , like it or not , you get scrubbed when you run for the big job .                
0 0 that 's how it happens .                                                
0 0 everybody sit .                                                      
0 0 next tomorrow 's news today , our reporters share from their notebooks including a carolina 's feud that 's not about basketball or barbecue .          
0 0 let 's head around the inside politics table and ask our great reporters to share a nugget or two .                    
0 0 julia pace .                                                      
1 1 on friday john podesta who 's a well-known democrat around town had his last day in the obama white house officially freeing him up to work for hillary clinton in
0 0 and there are a lot of democrats that are breathing a big sigh of relief around this .                        
0 0 podesta is someone who is known as a guy who can speak to the clintons with some straight talk , who can coordinate her campaign , coordinate outside groups .
0 1 we saw some risk among some of the outsider groups .                                      
0 0 and i 'm told that even though he 's going to be the campaign chairman he 's going to have a very hands-on day-to-day role .        
0 0 he 's not going to be somebody who 's just doing 30,000 foot strategic thinking .                            
0 0 that 's very important to a lot in the clinton camp .                                    
1 0 who thinks maybe some heads need to be banged in there ?                                    
0 0 skippy they call him , when he gets into this alternate ego when he gets a little angry .                      
0 0 peter hamby .                                                      
1 0 not a lot of people are talking about this but there is a state out there that 's shaping up to be the florida or michigan of the 2016 nominating
0 0 north carolina passed a statute last year that said they 're going to go the week after south carolina , one of the first four states in the republican nominating
0 0 south carolina votes on a saturday .                                              
0 0 that means north carolina will go on a tuesday .                                        
0 0 so three days after these first four states you could have a state with a lot of big media markets and a lot of voters right square in the middle
0 0 and the people i talked to in north carolina in the republican party there say they do not care at all if the republican national committee penalizes them with delegates
0 0 they want the attention .                                                  
0 0 they want to be square up front .                                            
0 0 remember , they usually go in may .                                            
0 0 it looks like they could be going in february in 2016 .                                    
1 0 that would change a lot .                                                
1 0 this session .                                                      
0 0 they 'll talk about this a little bit about this session .                                    
0 0 but there does n't seem to be a lot of appetite in the middle right now .                          
1 0 that would make it interesting .

1 1 john kasich , the governor of ohio is headed to south carolina this week .                              
0 0 it 's his first trip to an early primary state .                                      
0 0 he 's someone who has the credentials to basically be an instant contender -- popular governor of a big swing state .                
0 0 just reelected by 30 points and has n't done a lot to sort of stoke the 2016 talks to date .                  
0 0 this part of this tour he 's been doing all over the country of quacking for a balanced budget amendment which he claims this is not a gimmick .  
0 0 he 's actually trying to get this done .                                          
0 0 the more states that pass it , the more chances it has of actually having to be considered as a constitutional amendment .              
0 0 he 's been mostly out west so far .                                          
0 0 he 's one to keep an eye on .                                          
0 0 but you know , time is running out for him to decide .                                  
0 0 i spoke to him recently , he said he has n't made up his mind .                            
0 0 people close to him think he really has to decide what he 's going to do .                          
1 0 to your point , i talked to a couple of big new hampshire republicans this week who are interested who say , governor , we need to know .  
0 0 we need to know .                                                  
0 0 they 're getting a lot of pressure to decide .

1 1 there was a flap in hillary land this week between two competing super pacs who are backing senator clinton -- secretary clinton i should say .        
0 0 it really underscored the fact that as ever there are competing power centers john , as you know , in the clinton 's orbit .          
0 0 and really with hillary close to the only game in town , the competing power circles in democratic politics as well , and she is democratic politics .    
0 0 i am told that david brock who is at the center of this who resigned from the priorities usa from the board of priorities usa which was the big obama
0 0 one democrat told me that the priorities are groveling to david brock .                                  
0 0 i 'm told that he 's on course to come back to the board , like to happen early this week .

0 0 utah republican senator mike lee put the tea party on the map back in 2010 when he defeated incumbent republican senator robert bennett .            
0 0 now the establishment is trying to get revenge .                                          
0 0 you might say trying to return the favor .                                          
0 0 as yet , no serious lead challenger has emerged for 2016 .                                    
0 0 and the senator has begun working to quiet some of his business and establishment critics .                            
0 0 but i 'm told several business leaders in the state , that 's utah , now making a push to convince the former governor , jon huntsman to mount a
0 0 you might recall huntsman bombed as a gop presidential candidate in 2012 .                                  
0 0 he 's now in washington most of the time and is host of a radio show for the bipartisan group called no labels .

0 0 his deep pocketed dad is among those who do n't like senator lee a bit and i 'm told some national establishment players now about to join their utah allies
0 0 i 'm skeptical but worth watching .

    welcome to inside politics .                                                  
    i 'm john king .                                                  
    thanks for sharing some time with us today .                                          
0 0 a packed day on the campaign trail , we 're 22 days out , including mike pence and bill clinton events just this hour .          
0 0 we 'll keep an eye on those , dip in if we feel the need to .                          
0 1 plus , some brand new cnn poll numbers releasing right now from three presidential battleground states .                          
0 0 let 's get to them .                                                
0 0 first in the battleground state of ohio , let me move that one up , pull you in here , battleground state of ohio , good news for donald trump
0 0 a lot of bad news lately in polls , but donald trump up 48 percent to 44 percent .                      
0 0 the third party candidates at four and two respectively .                                        
0 0 a narrow lead for donald trump in battleground ohio , a state he needs to win .                          
0 0 let 's move now to north carolina , one of the most competitive states in american politics .                        
0 0 what do our new numbers show there , cnn/orc poll shows hillary clinton with the narrowest of lead , a one-point lead .              
0 0 so , statistically , a dead heat in north carolina .                                      
0 0 perhaps a little bit of clinton momentum .                                            
0 0 gary johnson gets 4 percent .                                                
0 0 jill stein is not on the ballot in north carolina .                                      
0 0 now let 's go west to nevada .                                            
0 0 this one 's a bit of a surprise .                                          
0 0 a state the democrats have won pretty convincingly the last two times out .                                
0 0 but , let 's take a peek here and look at these numbers , 46-44 .                            
0 0 again , a very narrow clinton lead .                                            
0 0 the statisticians would say that 's a dead heat , 46-44 .                                    
0 0 gary johnson gets seven .                                                  
0 0 none of the above , you can do that in nevada , gets 2 percent .                            
0 0 we 'll see if that goes a little high on election day .                                  
0 0 now , if you look at those numbers right there and you 're a trump supporter , well , after a tough couple of weeks , reason to see the
0 0 they believe the republican candidate can re-seize the momentum in wednesday 's third and final presidential debate .                        
0 0 but if you look at the other map , if you look at this , the electoral map , clinton 's state-by-state advantage , it 's still pretty overwhelming heading
0 0 again , narrow leads for her in nevada and north carolina .                                    
0 0 trump up a little bit now .                                              
0 0 perhaps in ohio .                                                    
0 0 but the hard truth for trump is , she can afford to lose all three of those states and still win the election , which is why trump now adds
1 1 false stories , all made up , lies , lies .                                      
0 0 no witnesses .                                                      
0 0 no nothing .                                                      
0 0 all big lies .                                                    
0 0 it 's a rigged system .                                                
0 0 and they take these lies and they put them on front pages .                                  
0 0 this is a rigged system , folks .                                            
1 1 with us to share their reporting and their insights as we begin the week , julie pace of the associated press , ed o'keefe of `` the washington post ,
0 0 let 's start with these polls because they 're three of the most competitive states in the country .                      
0 0 they 're very close right now .                                              
0 0 if you 've looked at the past couple of weeks you would think , well , why is n't it a blowout then ?            
0 0 everything thought , even republicans would tell you , the race is over .                                
0 0 we have a big debate wednesday night .                                            
0 0 as i said , hillary clinton can afford to lose north carolina , afford to lose ohio , afford to lose nevada .              
0 0 thy do n't want to , they do n't think they will , but they can afford to lose all those three .              
0 0 but just that they 're tight enough , does that tell you , for all of this talk that it 's over , that trump has a chance , if
1 1 yes , i think is the short answer , but he needs to do more than have a compelling debate performance .                
0 0 right now he has a solid group of supporters that have stuck with him and will continue to stick with him basically no matter what happens over the next three
0 0 he needs to move them over into his camp .                                        
0 0 i think what 's helping keep this close is that hillary clinton remains unpopular , even as she has pulled ahead in some of these polls .      
0 0 if you look at her favorability ratings , you have n't seen huge changes there .                            
0 0 she 's not out on the campaign trail a lot , not doing a lot pro- actively to try to change impressions of her and she 's getting this slow
1 0 if this is the best , last chance for trump , this week ahead that includes this big debate , the last time you 'll have whether it 's 60
0 0 now , remember , we did n't hear this when he was winning the republican primaries .                          
0 0 we did hear this a couple of times when he was in a bad stretch in the republican primaries .                    
0 0 but donald trump tweeting out this morning , at a time his campaign team is saying he means the media , he means you guys in the media are trying
0 1 well , that 's not what donald trump says .                                        
0 0 `` of course there 's large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day .                              
0 0 what do republican leaders deny what is going on ?                                        
0 0 so naive . ''                                                    
1 0 well , he does n't seem to have any evidence of that .                                  
0 0 and secretaries of state across the country , a number of them republicans , including in ohio , are saying , no , it 's - it 's - there
0 0 the real problem for him right now is , these kind of tweets sound like he 's already conceding defeat .                  
1 0 but there were a lot of - there were a lot of people who think that .                          
0 0 there are a lot of people speculation about he 's - all of this now attacking the establishment , attacking the republican party , trying to delegitimize a clinton victory
1 1 well , i think the problem goes beyond his performance in a debate or even tweeting , because the problem for him has always been that the map is a
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 i 'm not sure we 've seen evidence he can do that .                                  
0 0 it remains close because undecided voters , if you look at focus groups , are different than they 've been in the past .            
0 0 undecided voters in the past are unengaged and then they sort of clue in right at the last minute and make a decision .            
0 0 undecided voters this time are very engaged and disgusted with their choices .                                  
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so it 's unclear how those guys will behave in the next couple of weeks , but it does n't surprise me a ton that it keeps tightening up for
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 people want a change , but they 're afraid of the change he 's offering .                            
1 1 but they want a change .                                                
0 0 and we also - and democrats do n't like this when you say it , but we live in a center right country .            
0 0 if you look at the national map , if you look at the republican house minority , if you look at the fact that they have 54 senate seats ,
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 if you look at the legislative gains in the last eight or 10 years , mostly republican .                        
0 0 it 's a center right country , but democrats win the white house when voters in the middle , moderates , suburban women especially , reject the presidential - you
0 1 i want to bring him up here because he 's a republican .                                  
0 0 now trump 's going to say , i 'm at war with the republicans in ohio .                          
0 0 the governor wo n't endorse me .                                              
0 0 this guy 's a friend of the governor .                                          
0 0 so trump would say , same old establishment criticizing me .                                      
0 0 but listen to the secretary of state in ohio here .                                      
0 0 a pretty big state in this country .                                            
0 0 they a lot of close elections in ohio .                                          
0 0 the secretary of state says , rigged ?                                            
0 0 no way .                                                      
1 0 well , i 'll say a couple things .                                          
0 0 first of all , i can reassure donald trump , i am in charge of elections in ohio and they 're not going to be rigged .      
0 0 i 'll make sure of that .                                              
0 0 our institutions , like our election system , is one of the bedrocks of american democracy .                          
0 0 we should not question it or the legitimacy of it .                                      
0 0 it works very well .                                                  
0 0 in places like ohio , we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat .                            
0 0 we have a bipartisan system of elections .                                            
1 0 so there 's a republican secretary of state , and there are 50 of them , plus , you know , an official here in the district of columbia and
0 1 they saying , yes , sure , every now and then there 's a couple of shenanigans at this polling place or that polling place , but there 's no
0 1 there 's no such thing .                                                
0 0 and he has rudy giuliani , in addition to donald trump 's tweets and steve king , the congressman from iowa on television saying , of course the democrats cheat
0 1 i mean i - no offense to these people here , but mayor - mr. mayor and congressman , i 'll ask these four not to come in some day
0 0 you bring me evidence - you bring me evidence that says this election was swayed by fraud and here 's the proof , and you can have the hour .
0 0 bring me the proof .                                                  
0 0 but - so why is trump saying this ?                                          
1 0 because he 's - again , i think it 's - they understand that he 's in a losing position .                  
0 0 he 's in a defensive crouch right now and this is all he really has .                            
0 0 it 's trying to depress voter turnout overall by making more people upset about this election , sick of it , tired of it and just wanting it to go
0 0 they feel that if they can do that , perhaps these numbers come out in their favor .                        
0 0 the other problem here , i look at these numbers in ohio , north carolina , nevada , that all suggests a turnout operation is necessary in those states .
0 0 republicans are lag in all three .                                              
0 0 if they can keep it close in nevada , the state where i think we will be waiting up for most of all on election night , democrats believe they
0 0 they did it for harry reid in 2010 .                                          
0 0 they did it in 2012 .                                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 maybe the flooding affects it a little bit , but otherwise they can get ahead of it because republicans do n't have operations in these states .      
1 1 you make a key point .                                                
0 0 we 're going to dig deeper into those numbers a little bit later in the show .                          
0 0 but , mitt romney woke up on election day thinking he was going to win and he had every reason to think that .            
0 0 he was tied in the polls heading into the election .                                      
0 0 he had momentum .                                                    
0 0 but , he was out hustled .                                              
0 0 out hustled on election day and , more importantly , out hustled before election day with all the early voting operations .                
0 0 mike pence has been a little bit different .                                          
0 0 donald trump tweeted this morning -                                                
1 0 .                                                          
1 1 and we 've seen this - we 've seen this on other issues in the past .                          
0 0 syria , from the vice presidential debate .                                            
0 0 then donald trump saying in the next debate , no , no , no , i disagree with mike pence .                  
0 0 but donald trump saying , of course there 's large-scale voter fraud happening .                                
0 0 essentially saying , you know , if she wins , she cheated .                                  
0 0 that 's what he 's trying to say in advance .                                      
0 0 mike pence , listen to him here , he says , no , i do n't think so .                      
1 0 we will absolutely accept the results of the election .                                        
0 1 look , the american people will speak in an election that will culminate on november the 8th , but the american people are tired of the obvious bias in the
0 1 that 's where this sense of a rigged election goes here .                                    
0 0 we 'll accept the will of the american people , you bet .                                  
1 1 now , he 's , again , he 's blaming the media , which is a - bring your specific complaints , but it 's a conservative -    
1 1 a classic republican attack line in a close election .                                        
1 1 it 's - it 's classic .                                              
0 0 it 's tried and true and never works .                                          
1 0 you can say it .                                                  
1 0 but it 's - but it 's - can we see - if hillary clinton wins , is she going to walk out at her rally that night and said
1 1 i think it -                                                    
1 1 and governor pence says we accept the will of the american people but , sorry , donald does n't ?                    
1 1 i think it 's a real question .                                            
0 0 until donald trump drops this idea that there is going to be voter fraud on november 8th , i think it 's a real open question on whether he would
0 0 obviously mike pence and other republicans , i do n't want to cast all republicans under this rigged election umbrella because a lot of them are very concerned about just
0 0 it 's very dangerous to our democracy .                                            
0 0 but trump seems to be kind of conflating two things here .                                    
0 0 you saw this both in the democratic primary and you 've seen it in this election that there are a lot of americans that think that much of what we
0 0 that it 's rigged for the wealthy .                                            
0 0 that the media is rigged for democrats .                                            
0 0 and that 's a real concern that i think we should be discussing .                                
0 0 but taking it to this level and saying that the actual results of an election are rigged is something much different .                
1 1 well , it -                                                    
1 1 and i - i do n't think he 's going to let go of the argument because it 's - he did this during the primaries .      
0 0 it 's a bit of an insurance policy for if he loses so that he can blame it on something .                  
0 1 i think that 's just part of his personality .                                        
0 0 as usual , the story 's sort of in the middle .                                    
0 0 like voter fraud is a real thing .                                            
0 0 people are prosecuted for it .                                                
0 0 it does not usually happen in large enough numbers to sway elections .                                  
0 0 i think some of the voters that he speaks to , and i do n't think he 's having this whole thought process , are mad that that voter fraud
0 0 and so when he makes this argument , they react to it in a sort of visceral way .                      
0 0 but i do n't think that many of them used to buy the idea that swayed all these elections .                    
0 0 we 'll see if he convinces them otherwise .                                          
1 0 but i also think he 's laying the predicate for the argument that 's going to happen after the election if he loses within the republican party , where the
0 1 and by saying that the results of the election are illegitimate , you are giving sort of a second wind to sort of trumpian politics .        
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 well , and , remember , he spent years trying to delegitimize the current president .                            
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 by being a cheerleader for the birther movement .                                          
0 0 so the question is , is he - does he have plans already , if he thinks he 's going to lose , to set up some shop , whether
0 0 she 's not legitimate .                                                  
0 0 do n't let - do n't support anything .                                          
0 0 do n't support compromise .                                                  
0 1 we 'll see how this one goes .                                            
0 1 quickly on this point here , let 's bring in tim kaine , who , talking about this , he 's asked about this and he thinks donald trump is
1 0 he 's blaming the media .                                                
0 0 he 's blaming the gop .                                                
0 0 he 's saying that america ca n't run a fair election .                                    
0 0 he is swinging at every phantom of his own imagination because he knows he 's losing .                          
1 0 and ?                                                        
1 1 that 's the argument - that 's the argument they 'll make in the closing days here .                        
0 0 and , you know , and the democrats will , once again , have to push back against another series of unsubstantiated claims that he 's making .    
0 0 you know , this is - this is - this is how he keeps his name in the news and this is how he continues to frustrate a lot of
1 1 well , and telling donald trump - telling donald trump he 's acting a way because he 's losing makes him act that way doubly .        
1 0 even more .                                                      
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 i would just close on this note .                                            
0 0 if this - if there is consistent , persistent widespread election fraud in america , then the republicans stole the house of representatives , the republicans stole the senate ,
0 1 i think not .                                                    
0 0 i think not .                                                    
0 0 i think they won them .                                                
0 0 i think they won them fair and square .                                          
0 0 ahead , the wiki - hacked wikileaks hacked e-mails may well be a nefarious russian plot , but is it also a clinton campaign headache , as she prepares for
0 0 back to our conversation in a moment .                                            
0 0 first , though , a developing news story that 's a potential headache for hillary clinton heading into the third and final presidential debate , the release of fbi documents
0 0 our senior washington correspondent , joe johns , joins us with the new details .                              
0 0 joe .                                                        
1 1 john , this is the latest red flag that some congressional republicans say they 've identified and their continued look back into the hillary clinton e- mail server situation .
0 0 new documents released by the fbi shed some light into a back and forth between the fbi and the state department where questions got raised about whether a top state
0 0 the question was whether undersecretary of state for management , patrick kennedy , was suggesting the state department would consider addressing a need for additional space for fbi personnel stationed
0 1 the fbi looked into the situation , and putting out a statement today said that while there was never a quid pro quo , these allegations were nonetheless referred to
0 0 now , congressional republicans , starting at the top with the speaker of the house , saying the situation demonstrates hillary clinton had a complete disregard for properly handling classified
0 0 the state department put out a statement too today asserting that the allegation of a quid pro quo is inaccurate and that it does n't align with the facts .
0 0 john .                                                        
1 1 joe , thanks very much .                                                
0 0 we 'll see how this one carries over to the debate .                                    
0 0 so , let 's get back to the group .                                        
0 0 can donald trump distill this stuff , this from the fbi , other stuff in the hacked john podesta e-mails , the campaign chairman john podesta , released by wikileaks
0 0 here 's why she should n't be president and i assume the argument is , she 's part of this system where there 's collusion , where there 's insider
0 0 can he do it ?                                                  
1 1 i do n't know if he can do it , but he should do that if he hopes to win .                  
0 0 i mean the clearest , most concise argument that he and other republicans have made about hillary clinton is that she comes from this political system that most americans agree
0 1 in some cases maybe rigged against middle class americans and that you ca n't trust her because there 's a different hillary clinton behind closed doors than the one you
0 0 and if you look at the wikileaks e-mails that have been coming out the last few days , you certainly see that there 's a lot of discussion about what
0 0 but trump just , like , can not get himself focused on these issues .                              
0 1 if he can , it 's effective .                                            
1 1 it 's also hard .                                                  
0 0 it 's also hard .                                                  
0 0 they 're very confusing issues .                                                
1 1 they are .                                                      
1 0 the conversation with the state department , back to the fbi about classifying a document .                            
0 0 somebody brought up the fbi needs office space or safe spaces to live in places like iraq .                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 what ?                                                        
1 1 well , no , but people - people know -                                        
1 1 but that 's the point , right ?                                            
1 0 people know what a - what a deal is and what a quid pro quo is and it seems to look like this guy was trying to minimize fallout for
0 0 people can understand that .                                                  
0 0 i do think , in the second debate , trump did seem to have studied up a little bit more on the e-mail stuff , on the classified markings and
0 0 if he could make that step , i think it would be go for him .                            
0 1 he needs to make the argument over and over again that these e-mails , which i think they do , show she is business as usual in washington and business
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 and that is an effective argument for him , but he needs to dress it up with the facts and -                  
1 1 that 's his - that 's his most effective argument .                                      
1 1 and that - and that 's my read of the e-mails as well is that the sort of worst part of them is watching a campaign struggle to sell what
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 it - i think what it does is it basically - in the e-mails you see the campaign struggling with a lot of the very same issues that bother the
0 0 smoking gun ?                                                      
0 0 new information ?                                                      
0 0 not necessarily .                                                      
0 1 but it is kind of a reminder of what it is that has made a large section of the public uneasy with .              
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 like the circle the wagon party inside her campaign .                                        
0 0 whatever the question is , whatever it 's about , being canid , being transparent , being open , saying what happened , even getting her to say , ``
0 0 i just want to stop , pause for a minute here , because this is a big part of the debate , what 's in these e-mails .    
0 1 now , it 's possible - the government says likely - that russia hacked into democratic party databases and john podesta , the clinton campaign chairman 's database .  
0 0 that 's horrible and we should be worried about that .                                      
0 0 a foreign state actor playing in .                                              
0 0 but republicans say , whoever did it , the information is still available to us and clinton should answer for it .                
0 0 listen to the differing opinions here from rudy giuliani , trump supporter , and tim kaine , clinton 's running mate .                
1 0 wikileaks very refreshing .                                                    
0 0 this is the hillary clinton i always knew existed , i just never had proof of it .                        
0 0 people would say to me , she 's a socialist and i 'd say , ok , but you ca n't prove it .            
0 1 well , she was in canada , she was talking to the canadian bank or whatever .                          
0 0 she says , i like your system , your socialized system of medicine a lot better than ours .                      
1 1 i ca n't think of a precedent of a foreign nation trying to destabilize an american election , and i - you know , i - i brought up a
1 0 so the clinton campaign says , we 're not going to answer the specifics , because this is all part of some crime .            
0 0 it is part of a crime .                                              
0 0 but the specifics are pretty interesting , and they force questions .                                    
0 0 and , you know , rudy having fun there saying , ah , finally , here 's the proof .                    
1 0 now , it 's - this - i mean , i 've spent some time looking at these last week , and it does , as the mayor suggested ,
0 0 i did n't get to the speeches , but i was certainly diving into podesta 's inbox .                        
0 0 sorry , but it 's available to us now .                                        
0 1 and there 's proof that they - that they have struggled with this .                                
0 0 and they have struggled with how to talk to her about her struggles with the truth .                          
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 well , and -                                                    
1 1 and that , most of all , i thought was quite telling .                                  
1 0 there 's another thing that trump may have some fun with , which is the e-mails that do come from reporters that say , hey , just want to give
0 0 like , there is some sucking up .                                            
0 0 there 's a little bit of coordination .                                            
0 0 it feeds into the argument he 's making .                                          
0 0 republican voters will be more than happy to hear a few jabs at that and .                            
1 0 but the question is , does it get him - does it - can he - it is just fun ?                  
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 is it , you know , or does it - can he grow ?                                
0 0 yes , can grow ?                                                  
1 1 it 's more of the .                                                
1 1 it can be both because the most effective moment for him in the first debate was in those first 30 minutes -                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 when he kept talking about , she is a creature of washington .                                  
0 0 she has been in this city for 30 years .                                        
0 0 she has been part of the problem .                                            
1 0 she will not change .                                                  
0 1 right .                                                        
1 0 this inbox proves it .                                                  
0 0 that 's the argument he can make consistently over the course of the debate and it would keep her unfavorable where they are .            
1 0 and i 'm waiting to see how trump , who says he 's a populist and runs as an economic populist in some ways , i mean the democrats ,
0 1 this is in john podesta 's e-mails and they 're dealing with , well , what if those speeches ever leaked out , the clinton speeches that she got big
0 0 what 's in them ?                                                  
0 0 in one of them is hillary clinton talking to goldman sachs and she says , `` with political people again , i would say the same thing , you know
0 0 if you 're a elected member of congress and people in your constituency were losing job and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it 's all the
0 0 but what you do is really important . ''                                          
0 0 so she 's essentially saying , i do n't know if that big legislation it 's become a hallmark of the obama presidency , that is a - the last
0 0 she says , i do n't really know if it 's any good or if we really needed it , but we had to do something to take a 2x4
1 1 well , i think - i think it gets to a major question that democrats , particularly younger democrats , people who are more aligned with bernie sanders and elizabeth
0 0 and she has managed to position herself now to the left of where she 's been on certain issues .                    
0 0 but the suspicion has always been that she is more friendly to wall street than democrats are right now .                    
0 0 more pro-trade than democrats seem to be right now .                                        
0 0 and you see her in these e-mails , her staff debating where she should be on trade , talking to wall street and suggesting that dodd/frank was more a politic
0 0 and i think that she should have to answer for that .                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 one of the thing - one thing , it crystallizes this idea that many americans have of , they do n't do things well in washington .      
0 0 like , something must be done .                                              
0 1 well , this is something .                                                
0 0 let 's pass it .                                                  
0 0 that 's not a good argument to be making for someone who 's been in washington for a long time .                  
1 0 it is not .                                                    
0 0 and we do know , look , again , i agree in half with the clinton campaign .                        
0 0 this is a legitimate issue .                                                
0 0 why are the russians doing it if it 's the russians and are they doing it to support trump ?                    
0 0 that 's great .                                                    
0 0 but there 's a lot in here to be answered .                                      
0 1 well , one of our -                                                
1 1 a lot .                                                      
1 1 one of our businesses ' toughest questioners , chris wallace , will be at the center stage in that debate wednesday night .              
1 1 who knew .                                                      
1 0 i suspect this is going to come up .                                          
0 0 and it should .

    i believe very clearly karl rove ought to be fired .                                      
    can mr. bush walk away from questions about rove and the cia leak case .

1 0 if there 's a leak out of my administration , i want to know who it is .                        
1 0 has the white house changed its tune about the leak now that rove is under so much scrutiny ?                      
1 0 the president consults with senators about the opening on the high court .                                  
1 0 the president can certainly nominate somebody who would unite us and not divide us .

0 0 for a second straight day , the white house refused to answer a barrage of questions about karl rove 's link to a cia leak and this time president bush
0 1 but the administration did offer a vote of confidence in rove 's continued work at the white house as deputy chief of staff , despite new calls from democrats for
1 1 well , john , the white house is facing questions about its own credibility , starting with president bush .                    
0 0 president bush was asked directly in an oval office photo op earlier today ; he was shouted the question whether or not he would go through the pledge that he
0 0 president bush did not respond to that question .                                          
0 0 of course , also earlier today , white house press secretary scott mcclellan , also for a second day in a row , essentially pummeled by reporters on the issue
0 0 and third , of course , the question over the credibility of karl rove himself .                            
0 0 there were several questions directed to mcclellan over whether or not the president still has confidence in his top political advisor .                
1 0 does he retain confidence in karl rove , specifically ?                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 any individual who works here at the white house has the president 's confidence .                              
1 0 now , john , do n't be fooled : the fact that we got so little information publicly from that briefing , publicly from the president , as well .
0 0 there is an all-out full campaign that is going on : damage control , as you know .                        
1 0 the intention of why he spoke to the `` time '' magazine reporter in the first place .                        
0 0 all of this , of course , trying to make sense of it .                                
0 0 this is yet to go away -- john .                                          
1 0 and suzanne , stand by .                                                
0 0 i want to come back to you in just a moment .                                    
0 0 first , i want to get the perspective from capitol hill and turn to our ed henry -- ed ?                    
1 1 john , no surprise , democrats here are pouncing on this story , raising tough questions about whether or not the white house misled the nation for two years about
0 0 and today , two top democrats ratcheted up the pressure on the white house .                              
0 0 john kerry and hillary clinton , two senators who may be eying the democratic presidential nomination in 2008 , both indicated they believe karl rove should be fired over his
0 0 this came at a press conference where democrats were pressing for more funding for port security and rail security in the wake of the london bombings .      
0 0 and at the end of his statement , john kerry , somewhat cryptically , said he believes that this is white house has more concern about the job security of
0 0 when i pressed kerry later , on whether or not he was referring to karl rove , he teed off on rove and you wo n't see hillary clinton on
0 0 and then she commented briefly at the end .                                          
0 0 take a listen .                                                    
1 1 is the value of day-to-day politics and the value of political advice and the value of his position greater than the national security of our country and the protection of
0 0 the white house 's credibility is at issue here and i believe very clearly karl rove ought to be fired .                  
1 1 it 's very interesting that amid these democratic attacks , though , senate majority leader bill frist , the republican leader , told me today that he will not comment
0 0 he 's not rising to karl rove 's defense and he 's not attacking him either .                          
0 0 you would expect the republican leader to be stepping up and defending the white house at this moment , but frist says he does not know enough about the grand
0 0 he does n't want to get into the details of this .                                    
0 0 republican aides privately saying we should n't read anything to that .                                    
0 0 it 's just the fact that nobody up here really has a sense about where this case is going .                    
0 0 other top republicans like rick santorum , a member of the republican leadership , did say off camera , he believes democrats are overheated in their rhetoric and this is
1 1 karl rove was discouraging a reporter from writing a false story based on a false premise and the democrats are engaging in blatant partisan political attacks '' -- john ?
1 1 well , let me bring suzanne back into the conversation .                                      
0 0 ed , stay put .                                                  
0 0 let 's discuss the politics for a minute .                                          
0 0 suzanne , publicly the white house will see remarks like senator kerry 's and senator clinton 's and say partisan democrats just taking a swipe at karl rove .  
0 0 behind the scenes though , are there any concern that this is could be a distraction from karl rove 's critical work , whether the issue be social security or
1 1 well , certainly there 's some concern about that .                                        
0 0 the energy plan ; the president talking about that with members of congress here at the white house this afternoon .                  
0 0 no one talking about that at all .                                            
0 0 also , social security , all of his domestic items on the agenda , of course , really just put on the back burner here .        
0 0 that 's is the main concern they have .                                          
0 0 legally they know , john , that they 're in strong standing here .                                
1 0 well , let 's just keep things quiet .                                          
0 0 let 's let this blow over .                                              
0 0 let 's see how the investigation unfolds .                                            
0 0 but that is the big question here , whether or not you will see in the months to come that whether or not there 's going to be any business
1 0 and ed , you say republicans are being careful .                                        
0 0 they say they do n't have information about the legal investigation .                                    
0 0 already on social security and other issues , we saw them veering away from the bush agenda to some degree .                  
0 1 perhaps another example of that here .                                              
0 0 are they nervous ?                                                    
1 1 i think they are nervous privately , but what they are telling us is that so far , this issue is a beltway issue .          
0 0 it 's not resonating , they believe , in the heartland .                                    
0 0 but they are nervous that it may eventually resonate in the heartland if , of course , there are any indictments in this case or there are any developments in
0 0 this certainly , all of a sudden , could be the kind of issue that middle america starts paying attention to .                
0 1 right now , they think it 's just a washington story .                                    
0 0 they 're going to try to ride it out , john .                                    
1 0 suzanne malveaux at the white house .                                              
0 0 ed henry on capitol hill .                                                
0 0 thank you both .                                                    
0 0 an interesting day , again .                                                
0 0 today president bush did answer reporters ' questions about his search for a new supreme court justice and he reached out to senators with influence over the confirmation process .
0 0 was it true consultation or a prelude to confrontation ?                                        
0 0 cnn 's joe johns is at the supreme court -- joe ?                                    
1 1 john , this was clearly an attempt by the officials closest to this process to try to elevate the debate or at least , to appear to get off on
0 0 the white house releasing a photograph today , showing the president with democratic senator patrick leahy of vermont , who is in that meeting .          
0 0 of course , there are about seven people in that room we are told , including the vice president .                    
0 1 the white house and republicans also indicating that the president or his staff , have already contacted virtually every single member of the judiciary committee , 60 senators in total
1 0 my only question to them is : what will it take to be able to get a person confirmed by early october ?              
0 0 secondly , we talked in general about a potential nominee .                                      
0 0 they 've got strong opinions and i wanted to hear them .                                    
0 0 and they have shared some opinions with me and of course , they 're sharing -- many senators are sharing their opinions with others on my staff .    
0 0 we 're actively seeking recommendations .                                                
1 0 now after that meeting , democratic leader harry reed and the chairman of the judiciary committee , arlen specter , came out and talked to reporters , giving their take
1 0 i would hope it would come when the president gives us a name or two or three and we 're able to talk to him about that .    
0 0 that 's something that i do n't want : to wake up in the morning and see a name in the paper .              
0 0 i think that this process that he 's started should continue and from the meeting i had this morning , i have no reason to think that 's not the
1 1 now , apparently democrats threw out a number of names , including judges edward prado , sonia sotamayor and ricardo hinojosa .                
0 0 the president did not offer any names of his own .                                      
0 0 senate democratic leader harry reid ...                                                
0 1 one of the recommendations has been to try to select someone from the senate .                              
0 0 senator reed has suggested , in fact today with reporters at the capitol , that one of the possibilities might be senator judd greg of new hampshire .    
0 0 he , of course , has what is essentially a master 's degree in law .                            
0 0 of course , he is a republican .                                            
0 0 meanwhile , there was no change in the status here at the capitol of the chief justice of the united states , william rehnquist .          
0 0 of course he came to work today just like he always has .                                  
0 0 no indication , despite all the speculation , that he might retire .                                  
0 0 so the waiting for a word on that continues .                                        
0 1 john , back to you .                                                
1 0 joe johns for us outside the supreme court on a steamy day .                                  
0 1 thank you very much , joe .                                              
0 1 and now let 's bring in one of those democrats the president is consulting and a democrat who will be front and center during the supreme court confirmation hearing ,
0 0 senator biden , is this true consultation ?                                            
1 1 well , i have n't heard from anyone .                                          
0 0 it does n't mean there 's not consultation .                                          
0 0 but no one in the white house has contacted me or anyone on my staff .                            
0 0 but i 'm not complaining about that , i 'm just pointing out that i have n't been contacted .                    
0 0 although i 'm confident they 're based on today 's meeting , as others have been .                          
1 0 you 've thought from time to time about running for president yourself .                                  
0 1 i think you 're thinking about it at the moment .                                      
0 0 if you were the president of the united states , would you share names with the opposition party on capitol hill , or would you just talk in broad parameters
1 1 i would share the name .                                                
0 0 i have significant experience in this .                                              
0 0 i spent a considerable amount of time with president reagan .                                      
0 0 he shared names with me when i was chairman of the committee .                                  
0 0 a matter of fact , he submitted to me about ten names and asked my opinion .                          
0 0 i gave him my frank assessment and in the presence of his then chief of staff howard baker , as to what prospects each of those nominees would have .
0 1 the result of that was tony kennedy , the supreme court justice from california .                              
0 0 the same process occurred after the fact , actually with bush i , president bush .                            
0 0 i -- the same process incurred in great detail with president clinton and sitting down with the then republican chairman -- i was the ranking member at the time of
0 0 it 's the wisest way to go when there 's a split government .                                
0 0 and it 's -- i would hope the president would do that .                                  
1 1 talk about the make-up of the court .                                            
0 0 sandra day o'connor was the only member of this court who had experience in elective office .                          
0 0 she served in the arizona state senate .                                            
0 0 should the president look outside the box , pick somebody who knows how to cut deals , a politician , essentially , and put them on this court ?  
1 1 well , it 's not so much cutting deals as someone who knows life experience .                            
0 0 we have enough academics on the court .                                            
0 0 if you go back and look over the history of the court , the history of the court has been peopled by significant political figures and men and women who
0 0 and it is the life of the law .                                          
0 0 and that is that life 's experience .                                            
0 0 and i -- whether it 's justice powell , who was a great lawyer who had been head of the aba , or whether it was hugo black , who
0 0 the exception is what we have now .                                            
0 1 the exception is , essentially , all academics .                                          
1 0 senator , i want to ask you a question on a different issue .                                
0 0 innocent until proven guilty , is what they teach you in law school .                                
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 0 karl rove says he did nothing wrong and that this investigation will prove that out .                            
0 0 until this investigation is done , is it appropriate for democrats to be saying he should resign , he should be fired , he should have security clearance taken away
1 1 if karl rove leaked not the name , but the identity of a cia agent , and knowingly did that , i know he saw -- i understand , i
0 0 but what i 've read from the newspaper accounts , he indicated that he said that the former ambassador 's wife was a member of the cia .    
0 0 that is a distinction without a difference .                                            
0 0 the fact that he did n't give her name , but identified the ambassador 's wife , it 's not -- does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out
0 0 if that occurred , at a minimum , that was incredibly bad judgment , warranting him being asked to leave .                  
0 0 the question in my mind is , is there a criminal case here ?                                
0 0 i 'd let the grand jury make that decision because you have to knowingly -- you have to knowingly release that information , knowing that the person 's name should
0 0 i do n't know enough to make that judgment .                                        
1 0 and lastly , senator , we 're almost out of time , but the john bolton nomination for the united nations ambassadorship .              
0 1 has that just fallen off the planet ?                                            
0 1 any conversations about trying to cut a deal or are you looking for a recess appointment from this president ?                    
1 0 i do n't know what the president is going to do .                                    
0 0 i have n't heard a word in the last three weeks from anyone in the administration relative to john bolton or the information that the senate has requested and is
0 0 so i have no notion what 's going on .                                        
1 1 senator joe biden of delaware , senior democrat ...                                          
1 0 thank you very much .                                                  
1 1 .. out of delaware .                                                  
0 0 thank you so much for your time .                                            
0 0 thank you , sir .                                                  
0 0 and we 'll get a republican take on karl rove and the search for a supreme court justice from senate judiciary committee arlen specter a bit later .    
0 0 also ahead , karl rove as political pinata .                                          
0 0 will he come out the wallops with his job intact ?                                      
0 1 plus , a `` strategy session '' on the supreme court opening and the prospect of a second slot to fill .                
0 0 and the first lady weighs in on her choice to replace justice o'connor .                                
0 0 more inside politics in just a moment , but first an update , some new information just into cnn , on the investigation of the london bombings .    
0 0 the british press association is reporting that police have found explosives in a car they believe was linked to those attacks .                
0 0 the car was parked in a train station in the town of luton , which is about 30 miles north of london .              
0 0 police cordoned off that parking lot at the train station before inspecting that vehicle .                              
0 0 and we should also note , as we track developments in luton , police sources also telling cnn that in bedfordshire , another town near luton , police are investigating
0 0 more developments as we get them to you here on cnn .                                    
0 0 and now we 'll continue inside politics and our discussion of karl rove 's purported role in the media leak of a cia employee 's identity .      
0 0 dan balz , who 's covering this story for `` the washington post , '' is among those who know karl rove best in this town .      
0 0 he joins us now live from `` the post '' newsroom .                                    
0 0 karl -- dan , i 'm sorry -- any question in your mind , as the legal investigation goes forward , about the politics of this at the white house
0 1 scott mcclellan obviously in a very difficult position .                                          
0 0 but there are no indications at all that karl rove 's job is in trouble .                            
1 0 no , and in fact , scott mcclellan today did something he did n't do yesterday , which was he reaffirmed the president 's confidence in karl rove .  
0 0 as you recall yesterday when scott mcclellan was asked that , he answered in the same way he answered all questions , which was , given the ongoing investigation ,
0 0 something obviously happened overnight to force them to change their position on that question .                              
0 1 i think the other notable thing that 's happened today is that , while the white house has not gone any farther in trying to explain karl rove 's role
0 0 he 's jumped into it to defend mr. rove .                                        
0 0 and the rnc has put out documentation to suggest their version of events is the accurate version .                        
1 0 and so the rnc chairman ken mehlman , though , as you well know , dan , is a very close friend of karl rove and a colleague in the
0 1 surprising to you at all or is it indicative of anything , that republicans on capitol hill are n't rushing to the microphone to defend karl ?      
1 1 well , i think it is important to note that they are not doing that .                            
0 1 certainly in normal circumstances , given what democrats did yesterday in this case , you would expect that the republicans on the hill would be coming forward more rapidly .
0 0 perhaps the reason that mr. mehlman did what he did today was as a signal to them that they should begin to speak up .          
0 0 but i think the question that a lot of them have to be asking themselves is how much more do we not know ?            
0 0 you know , mike mccurry , who was the clinton white house press secretary during the monica lewinsky scandal , once coined this famous phrase of telling the truth slowly
0 0 and to some extent , that 's where we are in this situation with the white house .                        
0 0 so i think that republicans , before they get too far out in defending karl rove or anybody else over there , they certainly want to know more about what
1 1 i remember that phrase all too well .                                            
0 0 and if mike mccurry is watching , he 's not going to appreciate your reminding him of it , of those days .              
0 0 but let 's get into the democrats now .                                          
0 0 obviously they see a political opening here .                                            
0 0 and one would expect them to seize it .                                          
0 1 one would imagine if karl rove were advising the democrats , he would tell them to seize it .                      
0 0 but what is it about karl rove that makes him such a boogie-man for the democrats ?                          
0 0 why are they so gleeful , the democrats ?                                          
1 0 well , he has beaten them soundly in two presidential elections .                                    
0 0 soundly , you would say , not necessarily in the first one , since president bush did not win the popular vote .              
0 0 but in two head- to-head elections , his candidate has come out on top .                              
0 0 in addition to that , they know he has the ear of the president , that he occupies one of the most powerful positions in the government .    
0 0 they see him both as a political adversary and as somebody who on a policy sense now is also an adversary .                
0 1 so he is a very large target for the democrats , and a lot of people resent what he has been able to do politically on president bush 's behalf
1 0 and you know , dan , his work habits very well .                                    
0 0 is this a distraction to karl rove , or does he just work 22 hours a day and deals with this as he deals with all the policy issues ?
1 1 john , that 's a hard question for me to answer .                                    
0 0 he obviously is a multi-tasker and can keep a lot of balls in the air .                            
0 0 but this has to be something of a distraction for him .                                    
0 0 there is an ongoing legal case .                                              
0 0 his attorney has said that he 's been told by the prosecutor that karl rove is not a target in it .                
0 0 nonetheless , there is a tremendous amount of focus on him right now at least publicly , and i would think that it is at minimum a minor distraction .
1 0 dan balz at the washington post , thank you so much for your time today .                            
0 0 thanks .                                                        
1 1 thank you , john .                                                  
1 1 thank you , dan .                                                  
0 1 take care .                                                      
0 1 dan mentioned the rnc chairman ken mehlman .                                            
0 0 he will be a guest a little bit later today on `` wolf blitzer reports '' right here on cnn .                  
0 0 and more on karl rove and his influence just ahead .                                      
0 0 stay with us .                                                    
0 0 he 's a powerful man who prefers to stay behind the scenes .                                  
0 0 but now , karl rove is very much in the spotlight .                                    
0 0 next up , a look at why the president 's political mastermind is becoming such a punching bag .                      
0 0 plus , when it comes to rove , is the white house changing its tune ?                            
0 0 we 'll take a closer look how the bush administration has dealt with the story .                            
0 0 and later , a supreme opening .                                              
0 0 i 'll talk with judiciary committee chairman arlen specter about the president 's efforts to reach out to senators and whether that may make a difference .      
0 0 just about a minute till the markets close on wall street .                                    
0 0 and so , as we are every day , i 'm joined by christine romans in new york with today 's `` dobbs report . ''        
0 0 christine .                                                        
1 1 thanks , john .                                                    
0 0 well , stocks are little changed .                                              
0 0 it 's difficult for stocks to climb when oil prices are sharply higher , as they are today .                      
0 0 right now , the dow industrials are moving down almost five points , 10,514 .                              
0 0 but the nasdaq is a third of 1 percent higher .                                      
0 0 it 's now at the highest level since the first trading day of the year for the nasdaq .                      
0 0 but oil jumped $ 1.70 a barrel .                                            
0 0 there are worry that the summer storms threaten oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico .                        
0 0 another storm is brewing in the atlantic and could be headed that way .                                
0 0 former enron employees who lost everything when that company collapsed could finally be getting some cash back .                        
0 0 enron settled a lawsuit by agreeing to pay $ 356 million to 20,000 current and former workers who lost their entire pensions back in 2001 .        
0 0 that works out to be a little less than $ 18,000 a person for an entire pension .                        
0 0 however , the workers will likely see only a small fraction of the total amount .                            
0 0 that 's because the final amount paid depends on the bankrupt company 's assets available .                            
0 0 in another corporate collapse , a federal judge has denied a bid by former worldcom ceo bernie ebbers for a new trial .              
0 0 instead , he 'll face the judge tomorrow to be sentenced .                                    
0 0 ebbers was convicted in march on nine counts of conspiracy , securities fraud , and filing false statements with regulators .                  
0 0 prosecutors are seeking an 85-year prison sentence .                                            
0 0 ebbers has already agreed to forfeit nearly all of his personal assets , which total as much as $ 40 million .                
1 1 00 p.m. eastern on `` lou dobbs tonight , '' did karl rove leak the name or information of cia officer valerie plame ?            
0 0 we investigate and take a look at how the white house is handling it .                              
0 1 then , many consider the war on drugs a major failure , calling it the forgotten war .                        
0 0 we have a report on what the united states is doing to fight the import of illegal drugs .                      
0 1 plus , arizona has decided to take on immigration enforcement on its own .                                
0 0 we take a look at what that state has planned .                                      
1 1 00 eastern on `` lou dobbs tonight . ''                                          
0 0 now back to john .                                                  
1 1 thank you , christine .                                                  
0 0 back to inside politics in just a moment .                                          
0 1 but first , some remarkable pictures to show you , a bit of the legacy of hurricane dennis .                      
0 0 this scene , about 150 miles to the southeast of new orleans in the gulf of mexico , this an oil platform owned by british petroleum .      
0 0 it is called the thunder horse platform , again , 150 miles to the southeast of new orleans in the gulf of mexico .            
0 0 it was evacuated on friday , we are told .                                        
0 0 these are coast guard pictures , coast guard saying it believes as of now no pollution issues here , and no injuries , that we know of , anyway .
0 0 this platform , as you see , tilting into the gulf of mexico , caught in the path of hurricane dennis .                
0 0 remarkable pictures .                                                      
0 0 and now back to inside politics .                                              
0 0 the republican national committee is dismissing new calls for karl rove 's ouster from the white house as blatant partisan attacks .                
0 0 the democrats say growing evidence of rove 's connection to the cia leak case has put the administration 's credibility on the line .            
0 1 both sides might agree that rove has become even more of a magnet for controversy .                            
1 0 karl rove would be the first to tell you timing is everything in politics .                              
0 0 and at the moment , that leaves the man the president calls the architect at a significant disadvantage .                      
1 0 i believe very clearly karl rove ought to be fired .                                      
1 0 i 'm nodding .                                                    
1 1 innocent until proven guilty is the rule in a court of law .                                  
0 0 but in today 's washington , a deputy white house chief of staff at the center of a grand jury investigation is more than fair game .      
1 1 when did the president learn that karl rove had this ...                                      
1 1 i 've responded to the question , skip .                                          
0 1 go ahead .                                                      
1 0 especially this deputy white house chief of staff , who has a hand in everything from social security to picking a new supreme court justice , and whose influence in
1 0 i just do n't think this president 's going to do that .                                  
0 0 he 's going to stand by karl rove .                                          
0 0 karl rove has stood by him for over 20 years .                                      
0 0 he 's going to stand by him through a storm .                                      
1 0 to democrats , he is a nefarious boogeyman , the bad cop , they say , to a genteel president in a script critics say has played out time and
0 0 one glaring example , a president who says no one should play politics with the 9/11 attacks , and a rove political strategy in 2002 , 2004 , and again
1 0 conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war .                                
0 1 liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding to our attackers .                
0 0 king : even some republicans called that latest rove salvo an attempt to change the subject from mr. bush 's recent struggles .              
0 1 a majority of americans now say it was not worth going to war in iraq .                            
0 0 and more than six in 10 americans disapprove of how mr. bush is handling social security , the issue at the top of his second-term agenda .      
1 0 if you can discredit him , even wound him , you can take him out of action , if you can distract him , distract him before the supreme court
1 0 rove 's influence at times seems to take on mythical proportions .                                    
0 0 at last year 's republican convention , for example , some democrats saw in the design of this podium a cross designed to send a message to christian conservatives ,
1 0 my god , where do they come up with this stuff ?                                    
1 0 complicating the politics of the moment for rove is this dynamic , a white house that once adamantly said rove had no role in the leak at issue has clammed
1 0 i did n't know her name and did n't leak her name .                                  
1 1 rove tells friends he is certain he broke no laws and is not a target of the investigation .                      
0 0 and he also tells those friends he 's quite confident this storm will pass when the investigation comes to a close .                
0 0 but some republicans are getting more than a little nervous .                                      
0 0 and as one close rove associate put it after spending time with him this week , quote , `` he knows he 's going to be a pinata for a
0 0 if rove take as political beating , it ultimately may have less to do with the leak in question and more to do with the administration 's changing statements about
0 0 let 's bring in now our senior political analyst bill schneider .                                    
0 0 bill ?                                                        
1 1 well , john , it 's no longer the crime , it 's the credibility .                            
0 0 did the white house deliberately mislead the public in its various statements about the leak of a cia agent 's name in july 2003 ?          
0 0 here is what white house spokesman scott mcclellan said on september 29 , 2003 .                              
1 0 if anyone in this administration was involved in it , they would no longer be in this administration .                      
1 1 now we know that white house adviser karl rove discussed the cia agent 's role in the story with a reporter .                
0 0 here 's how mcclellan responded when he was asked that same day whether rove was involved in the leak .                    
1 1 it 's just totally ridiculous .                                                
0 0 i 've known karl for a long time , and i did n't even need to go ask karl , because i know the kind of person that he is
0 1 and he is someone that is committed to the highest standards of conduct .                                
1 0 the next day , president bush set a tough standard .                                      
1 1 if somebody did leak classified information , i 'd like to know it , and we 'll take the appropriate action .                
1 0 in june 2004 , the president confirmed what he meant by appropriate action .                                
1 0 and do you stand by your pledge to fire anyone found to have done so ?                            
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 here 's mcclellan 's response today , when he was asked whether rove had committed a crime .                        
1 0 now , that 's a question related to an ongoing investigation .                                    
0 0 it 's not the appropriate time to talk about those questions while the investigation is continuing .                          
1 1 rove 's attorney has confirmed that rove talked about the agent with the reporter .                              
0 0 whether he committed a crime is not clear .                                          
0 0 it depends on what the definition of the crime is .                                      
0 1 but the white house has said that rove was not involved in the story , and that anyone found to have anything to do with the leak would be fired
0 1 that is the credibility problem .                                                
1 0 and what is the shelf life of the credibility problem ?                                      
0 0 assuming that karl rove and his lawyer are telling the truth , that the investigation ends , there 's no criminal liability on karl rove 's fault , on part
1 0 i do n't think it 's passed .                                            
0 1 i think there 's a good deal of explaining to do about what the white house meant by those various statements .                
0 0 if they insist on the pure legal definition of a crime , i think they 're still going to be in trouble .              
1 0 karl rove may have to explain ...                                              
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 ... scott mcclellan .                                                    
0 0 thank you , bill schneider , very much .                                          
0 0 president bush says he 's actively seeking recommendations about prospective supreme court nominees .                                
0 0 up next , the senate judiciary committee chairman , arlen specter , talks about today 's consultations at the white house , and whether that may minimize partisan warfare .
0 1 also ahead , the london bombings lead to finger-pointing on capitol hill .                                  
0 0 rail insecurity , in our strategy session .                                            
0 0 and when we go inside the blogs , architect karl rove and the building-out rates on line .                        
0 0 and more now on the debate over potential replacements for retiring supreme court justice sandra day o'connor .                        
0 0 joining me now is the republican chairman of the judiciary committee , senator arlen specter of pennsylvania .                        
0 0 senator , thank you for joining us .                                            
1 1 nice being with you , john .                                              
0 1 thank you .                                                      
1 1 a meeting at the white house this morning , the president saying he will consult not only with republicans like yourself , but with democrats as well .    
0 0 any names put on the table by the president ?                                        
1 1 no names put on the table by the president .                                        
0 1 i think the president will put one name on the table when he 's ready .                            
1 1 when he 's ready .                                                  
0 0 so you do n't think he will , and nor do you think he should call up a democrats and say , `` i 'm thinking of arlen specter .
0 0 what do you think ? ''                                                
1 1 well , i think that 's up to the president .                                      
0 0 i think the consultation process is very important .                                          
0 0 we 're following the constitution , and that 's always a good sign .                                
0 0 it 's advise and consent .                                                
0 0 and he sat down today with not only senator frist , the majority leader , but also senator reid , the democratic leader , and senator leahy , the ranking
0 0 and we talked about a wide variety of subjects -- the kind of individual that the democrats would like to see nominated ; also , what senator frist and i
0 0 i ventured the suggestion , for example , that it would be good to move away from having all supreme court justices graduates from the courts of appeals .  
0 1 when we had brown versus board , a big case in the history of the country , there were three ex-united states senators and one-ex-governor , earl warren , and
1 0 so who 's your pick in that regard ?                                          
0 0 who would arlen specter say would be a good person -- a conservative that the president could agree with , and somebody that even the democrats might say , good
1 0 i 'm not going to say , john .                                          
0 0 i 'm not the president .                                                
0 0 the president has to make that selection .                                            
0 0 i think that i have greater freedom as chairman in the role that i have to play if i do n't name names .            
1 0 is n't it harder , though .                                              
0 0 there 's been this whole debate over , should you ask a nominee his or her views on gay marriage ?                  
0 0 should you ask a nominee his or her views on roe v. wade and abortion ?                            
0 1 if you pick someone who served in the united states senate or a governor or somebody who served in a legislature , they 're probably on the record on those
0 1 would that not make the fight more intense ?                                          
1 1 well , not necessarily .                                                  
0 0 if they 're on the record from what they 've said , so be it .                            
0 0 and there 's a lot of flexibility .                                            
0 0 i 've long believed that nominees ought to answer questions about judicial philosophy and about background , not about specific cases ; not how they 're going to rule in
0 0 but listen , when you have the breadth of having been a senator or having been a governor or having broad experiences , it 's going to -- there are
0 0 but i think the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses .                                        
1 0 i want to move on to other issues quickly .                                        
0 0 let 's start with karl rove .                                              
0 0 democrats say he should be fired or he should lose his security clearance .                                
0 0 arlen specter says ?                                                    
1 1 well , there 's a special prosecutor in the case , a man named fitzgerald , who 's independent of the department of justice .          
0 0 if anything is to be said , it would be up to him .                                
0 1 somebody is always looking for somebody 's scalp around this town .                                    
0 0 every week , it 's a new scalp they 're looking for .                                  
0 0 all i know is what i read in the papers , and i 'm not paying too much attention to it .                
1 0 you have been waging a courageous personal battle against cancer , and you got quite personal today at a hearing on capitol hill .            
0 0 you are among those who believe the government should do more in terms of funding for embryonic stem cell research .                  
0 0 there are a number of alternatives to legislation that would do that now kicking around , at least in proposals on capitol hill .            
0 1 my reading of what you said today was that you view some of those alternatives as a stalking horse , if you will , not serious proposals to get to
0 0 do you think there 's sort of a game going on here ?                                  
1 1 well , i think some of it may be stalking horses .                                    
0 0 i 'm prepared to see research on a variety of alternatives .                                    
0 0 but frankly , john , i 'm madder than hell that we have n't fought cancer or other maladies .                    
0 1 in 1970 , president nixon declared war on cancer .                                        
0 1 and if we 'd put the resources into the war on cancer that we put into other wars , i think that by the year 2005 , there would have
0 1 and when you have a country as rich as ours , and you devote one-fifth of 1 percent of the gross national product to medical research , and 1 percent
0 0 and i 'm going to be pushing it very hard .                                      
0 0 we 've let stem cells sit on the sidelines for eight years , and we could 've been curing a lot of diseases .            
0 0 and it 's scandalous that we do n't let medical research do what is realistic and possible to preserve our health and to prevent cancer and other maladies .  
1 1 we need to end there for time reasons today , but we 'll bring you back on that issue and i suspect many times on the looming supreme court battle
1 0 ok , john .                                                    
0 1 nice being with you .                                                  
0 1 thank you .                                                      
1 1 senator arlen specter , thank you very much , sir .                                      
0 0 and the debate over the supreme court leads off our tuesday political bites .                                
0 0 cnn has confirmed that kansas republican senator sam brownback has requested a meeting with the attorney general , alberto gonzales .                  
0 1 senator brownback wants that meeting because gonzales has been mentioned prominently as a possible supreme court nominee , and because conservatives have raised questions about some of the attorney general
0 0 first lady laura bush is in africa promoting u.s. efforts to battle aids .                                
0 1 but she 's also weighing in on the next supreme court pick .                                  
0 0 mrs. bush told the `` today '' show this morning , she has no idea of whom the president will chose to replace o'connor .          
0 0 but , she said , quote , `` i would really like him to name another woman . ''                      
0 0 when asked about his wife 's remarks , president bush told reporters , quote , `` i ca n't wait to hear her advice in person . ''    
0 0 democratic party chairman howard dean has been busy raising money for his party , and it appears to be paying off .                
0 0 the dnc reports it raised more than $ 28 million in the first half of this year , including a big jump in online donations .        
0 0 internet donors , of course , were a hallmark of governor dean 's presidential campaign .                            
0 0 and looking ahead to the 2008 white house race , massachusetts governor mitt romney continues to burnish his image among gop conservatives .

0 0 we 'll check in with our blog reporters to find out what people are saying about the president 's top adviser and the very rocky week of the white house
0 1 the karl rove controversy has left the official white house spokesman in an almost impossible position .                          
0 0 for two days now , he has tried , or at least attempted to try , to answer reporters ' questions without actually commenting on the investigation .    
0 0 here 's cnn 's bruce morton .                                              
1 1 portrait of a white house spokesman in trouble looks a lot like this .                                
1 0 as i 've previously stated , while that investigation is ongoing , the white house is not going to comment on it .              
0 1 well , those overseeing the investigation expressed a preference to us that we not get into commenting on the investigation .                  
0 0 i think the way to be most helpful is to not get into commenting on it .                          
1 1 well , you 're in a bad spot here , scotty .                                    
1 0 yes , but he has lots of company .                                          
0 0 when dwight eisenhower was president , the soviets shot down an american spy plan .                              
0 0 the u.s. said it was a weather plane , but the pilot confessed .                                
0 0 a pentagon spokesman said the government had a right to lie to its people .                              
0 0 big flap .                                                      
0 0 under lyndon johnson , so many officials told so many lies about the vietnam war that reporters took to wearing buttons , `` ambushed at credibility gap . ''  
0 0 ron ziegler , richard nixon 's white house press company , who dismissed the watergate break-in as a `` third-rate burglary , '' a year later announced that all of
0 0 and the president himself , of course , was in on the coverup .                                
0 0 ronald reagan , oliver north and company did n't tell him everything they were up to , but the gipper himself admitting misleading the voters once .      
1 1 a few months ago , i told the american people , i did not trade arms for hostages .                      
0 1 my heart and my best intentions still tell me that 's true , but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not .          
1 0 damaging , but americans loved him anyway .                                            
0 0 george herbert walker bush got into trouble for making a promise .                                    
1 1 read my lips .                                                    
0 0 no new taxes .                                                    
1 0 but then , he had to raise taxes .                                          
0 0 `` ambushed at credibility gap '' again .                                            
0 1 bill clinton .                                                      
0 1 you remember bill clinton .                                                  
1 1 i did not have sexual relations with that woman , miss lewinsky .                                  
1 0 most administrations bend the truth from time to time .                                        
0 0 it often does n't work , of course , but they think it will , until the voters remind them they do n't like politicians who wander from the truth
0 0 this week , it 's scott mcclellan 's turn , but he is far from the first .                        
1 0 and as i 've previously stated , while that investigation is ongoing , the white house is not going to comment on it .            
1 0 as yogi berra said once , sounds like deja vu all over again .                                
0 0 bruce morton , cnn , washington .                                              
1 1 as you might expect , scott mcclellan and karl rove are hot topics in the blogosphere .                          
0 0 we check in now with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner , our blog reporter .                        
0 0 jacki ?                                                        
1 1 well , john , we tried really hard to find some people who were n't talking about karl rove , and the only other person they seem to be talking
0 0 we found an interesting post today at the the jawa report .                                    
0 0 this is mypetjawa.mu.nu .                                                    
0 0 now , this is a right-leaning blog , but they 're saying something that we 're hearing from the left , and that 's that president bush should fire karl
0 0 why , they say ?                                                  
0 1 because he 's creating a political scandal , that he voted for president bush , not karl rove .                      
0 0 get rid of him .                                                  
0 0 this is not what we need in a time of war .                                    
1 0 and that 's , yes , not typical from the right , but something we 're certainly seeing on the left in the blogs and in the halls of congress
0 0 this is louise slaughter in new york .                                            
0 0 her campaign blog is already saying , send karl rove his pink slip .                                
0 0 but we found this interesting one over here .                                          
0 0 this is from marshall whitman , who is blogging at tpmcafe.com .                                    
0 0 marshall whitman used to be the director of communications for republican senator john mccain .                              
0 0 now he 's with the democratic leadership council .                                          
0 0 he 's telling democrats , do n't get too excited about this .                                  
0 1 karl rove is the indispensable man in washington .                                          
0 0 he also knows gop politics so well , he 's not going anywhere , suggesting even that that attack on liberals from a few weeks ago in a speech that
1 0 so should he stay or should he go , that one topic .                                  
0 0 people also taking a look at what exactly it is karl rove did , and what kind of trouble it 's going to get him into .      
0 1 justoneminute.typepad.com , another right-leaning blog , this is tom mcguire , who 's been following this for a little bit of time now , doing a very good in-depth job
0 0 and what he says is that we know that rove mentioned that wilson 's wife worked for the cia .                    
0 0 he did n't mention her by name .                                            
0 0 his question , does that matter ?                                              
1 1 well , bloggers are saying that 's just a technicality , by just saying `` wilson 's wife , '' anyone with a modem can find out what the name
0 0 and one blogger at fishkite.com went as far as saving the bio from ambassador wilson , which has now disappeared from the web , but you can find it at
0 0 you just scroll down to the bottom right there , and you see on his bio , he is married to the former valerie plame .        
0 0 very easy .                                                      
0 1 anyone who knows how to google could have found that information .                                    
1 0 now , something we just heard about was how scott mcclellan was taking heat from reporters at the press briefing yesterday .                
0 0 we 're seeing a lot of this theme online today .                                      
    you could n't pay me enough money to be scott mcclellan , people saying that looked like a cool job until just about yesterday .          
    so that sparked interest in someone , garrett graf at fishbowl dc .                                  
    he , you might remember , was the first blogger to be credentialed for the white house briefing room .

sentence: 
    now , something we just heard about was how scott mcclellan was taking heat from reporters at the press briefing yesterday .                
    we 're seeing a lot of this theme online today .                                      
    you could n't pay me enough money to be scott mcclellan , people saying that looked like a cool job until just about yesterday .          
0 0 so that sparked interest in someone , garrett graf at fishbowl dc .                                  
1 0 he , you might remember , was the first blogger to be credentialed for the white house briefing room .                    
0 0 he thought today might be a good day to go back .                                    
0 0 and you can find the reports , of course , from any journalist works in there in the white house briefing room today .            
0 0 but garrett 's is interesting for the little behind-the-scenes stuff .                                      
0 0 he 's throwing in that there was another blogger there , eric brewer of btc news .                          
0 0 but also looking at what the reporters were saying before the briefing .                                  
0 0 now , of course , there was a call , we talked about it yesterday , in the liberal blogosphere trying to press the white house press corps to ask
0 0 they were saying day five , day six , silence .                                      
0 0 and then they came through yesterday .                                              
1 0 garrett is reporting that before the briefing today , those very same reporters were saying , we 're here for the barbecue .              
0 1 and blood in the water seemed to be the common theme of what people were talking about .                        
0 0 one other thing we wanted to play on is , even some of the big-name bloggers who were n't blogging about karl rove were being pushed by their readers to
0 0 this is dr. steven taylor over at polly blog , pollyblogger.com .                                    
0 1 he posted on a story how u.s. workers waste two hours a day at work .                            
1 0 and at the very bottom , the very first comment he got was , is there a reason you 're not commenting on karl rove ?        
0 1 by the way , john , he says , he just has n't had the time to think about what he wants to say .          
0 0 he ca n't waste all that time at work , that 's all .                                
0 1 ladies , thank you very much .                                              
0 0 the white house continues not to answer questions about karl rove , even as democrats offer him to be fired .                  
0 0 coming up , the investigation into leaking a cia operative 's identity , and whether the president 's top adviser was involved .              
0 0 that 's today 's strategy session .                                              
0 0 time now to take on some of the day 's major issues , maybe have a little bit of fun , in today 's strategy session .      
0 0 with us today , democratic strategist paul begala and republican strategist rich galen .                                
0 0 today 's topics , silence from the white house in the case of karl rove , and the leaked identity of a cia operative , amid calls from democrats to
0 0 a supreme court meeting between the president and leaders from both sides of the senate for suggestions on possible supreme court candidates .              
1 0 and the call for more homeland security spending on mass transit here in america the week after a deadly bombing in britain .              
0 0 neither president bush nor white house spokesman scott mcclellan would say anything today about the growing questions over whether key bush adviser karl rove was involved in leaking the identity
1 0 i do n't want to get into commenting on things in the context of an ongoing investigation .                        
0 1 so let me step back and point out that any individual who works here at the white house has the confidence of the president .          
0 1 and surprise , surprise , that is n't stopping high-profile democrats from coming out swinging .                            
0 0 earlier today , former presidential candidate john kerry called on president bush to get rid of rove .                        
0 0 standing nearby , senator hillary rodham clinton , who just might run a few years from now , showed her agreement with a nod and a smile .    
0 0 let 's bring our guests into the discussion .                                          
0 0 paul begala , let me start with you , because you 've worked behind the scenes in the white house .                  
0 0 i know you 're a democrat .                                              
1 1 i know you 're glad you 're party 's making hay out of this right now .                          
0 0 grade scott mcclellan in his official job as harpoon catcher .                                      
0 0 yes , i do n't take any pleasure .                                          
0 0 and i watched you and your colleagues beating the heck out of poor mike mccurry , joe lockhart , dee dee myers , president clinton 's press secretaries .  
0 0 scott is in an untenable position .                                              
0 0 the president and his team sent him out at the beginning of this to tell people that mr. rove had nothing to do with it .        
0 0 a lot of us believed him , including me , a liberal democrat who does n't support the president 's policies .                
0 0 and i went back and looked .                                              
0 1 christi shawns , actually , our producer , looked up the transcript back .                                
0 0 there used to be a show called `` crossfire . ''                                      
0 0 and this topic came up .                                                
0 0 rove had been accused .                                                  
0 0 this said , `` i do n't believe karl did it , either .                                
0 1 let me be clear .                                                  
0 0 i know karl .                                                    
0 1 he 's a friend of mine from texas .                                          
0 0 i do n't believe it . ''                                              
0 1 now , a lot of people believed scott mcclellan and karl rove and the president and took them at their word .                
0 1 and what do we do now when we learn that they did n't tell us the truth .                        
1 1 well , just saying , i 'm not going to comment on it is not enough .                          
0 1 frankly , we deserve an apology , to begin with , and we deserve the real facts .                        
1 1 `` clintonian clever '' was a term used by republicans , back in the days of monica lewinsky , when some of the things said by the white house did
0 0 are they trying to be too clever here , or do you think that karl rove mislead scott mcclellan ?                    
1 0 no , i do n't think anybody mislead anybody .                                        
1 1 i think the original statement still stands , actually .                                        
0 0 that he had nothing to do with us ?                                          
1 1 stop , stop -- we 're not going to have a food fight .                                
0 0 we 're going to discuss this .                                              
1 0 i did n't bring the biscuits .                                              
0 1 just wondering .                                                      
0 0 that 's -- the question was , did karl rove out anybody .                                  
0 0 the answer is obviously no .                                                
0 1 this is something -- this is the august story that happens to be three weeks or so in advance .                    
0 0 the theater of a washington press corps -- and it happens on both sides , and it happened during your boss ' tenure , too -- the washington press corps
0 0 but this is an august story .                                              
1 1 this is going nowhere .                                                  
0 0 this is -- i mean , when the democrats are taking their cues from moveon.org and howard dean , i think you know where this thing is going , and
0 0 hold on for one second .                                                
0 0 i want to let the president add his voice to the debate here .                                
1 0 something the president said about this , back a little bit , but something that he said that just resonates here .                
0 0 let 's listen before we continue .                                              
0 0 listen , i know of nobody -- i do n't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information .                  
1 1 if somebody did leak classified information , i 'd like to know it , and we 'll take the appropriate action .                
0 0 and this investigation is a good thing .                                            
0 1 now , the question there is `` leaked classified information . ''                                    
1 0 and the white house would tell you , and karl rove 's lawyer would tell you , that if he said , you know , do n't believe any of
0 0 nothing illegal about that .                                                  
0 0 we do n't know .                                                  
0 0 i do n't know .                                                  
0 1 you do n't .                                                    
0 1 i do n't even think president bush knows .                                          
0 0 it 's in the hands of the grand jury .                                        
0 1 well , i -- hey , it 's the hands of the grand jury , and we should let that process go on .            
0 0 but politically , we were not told to carefully parse -- i did n't reveal that name of that woman , mrs. plame , mrs. wilson .      
0 0 no .                                                        
1 1 we were told , i had nothing to do with it .                                    
1 0 we were told it was ridiculous .                                              
1 1 but that 's also -- that 's true , though .                                      
1 1 the president misled the country ...                                                
0 1 oh , stop .                                                    
1 0 mr. rove misled the country .                                                
1 0 mr. mcclellan misled the country .                                                
0 1 this is a reflection of the high angst ...                                          
0 0 i believed them .                                                    
1 0 yes , i feel like a schmuck because i believed my long-time acquaintances from texas , karl rove , scott mcclellan , and a president who i like , personally
1 1 and i do -- i do get annoyed .                                          
1 0 nobody lied to you .                                                  
1 0 you ca n't trust these people as far as you can throw them , scott -- i mean , scott , i was thinking for scott mcclellan .    
1 0 that 's ok , john .                                                
0 0 john 's the better looking one .                                              
1 0 he 's got the better hair .                                              
0 0 that part we know .                                                  
0 0 let 's step back a little bit and help me understand the enigma , if you will , of karl rove .                
0 0 when carville and begala beat the former president bush , no republicans liked them .                              
1 1 they , of course , the failed governor of the small state , you know , somehow beat the president of the united states .          
0 1 but they did not take on this legendary status like karl rove has in this town .                          
0 0 oh , that 's not true .                                              
1 1 oh , no , absolutely they did .                                            
1 1 i mean .                                                      
0 1 well , thank you .                                                  
0 0 oh , there 's no question about it .                                          
1 1 i mean , somebody walked into the green room just now and said , paul begala 's in makeup .                    
1 1 no , no , i think ...                                              
0 0 your wife 's here ?                                                  
0 0 i think in this town -- in this town , you do get -- i mean , this is the hollywood east .              
0 0 i mean , you have great producers who produce great movies , get to -- kind of people talking about them when they walk through restaurants .      
0 0 people like begala and carville and rove , when they walk through restaurants , people go , oh .                      
0 0 or , in my case , if you walk through with the president , i walk through anywhere , still to this day with newt , people go , buzz
0 0 so i think that there is a co-equality , if there 's such a word , about the way that these two teams have been treated .      
1 1 i think the difference here is that because rove is still in the white house , still has a major role , and by the way , has a higher
0 0 i think that the democrats have -- are taking better aim at him than we were able or wanted to take at either paul or james .      
0 0 i think you 're just right .                                              
0 0 i think democrats tend to give karl too much credit when things go right , too much blame when things go wrong .              
0 0 the president has his strengths and his weaknesses .                                          
0 1 his greatest strength is that he is a really good political strategist in his own right , which is why , if i were advising the democrats on this ,
0 0 the president could fire karl today , and he 'll have the exact same policies tomorrow .                          
0 0 i believe that you focus on the organ grinder , not the monkey .                                
0 0 guys like karl , guys like me , guys like carville , certainly not mr. galen , we 're the monkeys .                
0 0 and we 're interchangeable .                                                  
0 0 you know , de gaulle said , `` the graveyards are filled with indispensable men . ''                          
1 1 karl 's an indispensable man to the president until the day he 's gone .                              
1 1 and i just think the democrats are wrong to have this fixation about karl ...                              
0 0 so what do you think -- tell me what you think 's going to happen ?                            
0 0 let me ask you this , looking forward .                                          
0 1 let me ask this going forward .                                              
0 0 clearly -- you think it 's an august story .                                        
1 1 but the press corps is ginned up .                                            
0 1 they think ...                                                      
1 0 that 's what happens with august stories .                                            
0 0 that 's my point .                                                  
0 1 they think when scott mcclellan said karl had no role in this , they think that meant no role at all , no conversations with any reporters about this at
0 0 how do you clean it up ?                                              
0 0 when it 's over -- let 's assume the grand jury finishes .                                  
0 1 karl rove is cleared .                                                  
0 0 no wrong-doing .                                                      
1 0 this credibility question , which you think is being exaggerated .                                      
0 0 how do you just say , all right , what do we do to just make this go away ?                    
1 1 it just goes away by its own -- by virtue of its own virtue .                              
0 1 when you read isikoff 's report of the leaked -- interestingly enough -- the leaked e-mails from `` time '' magazine -- `` time '' leaking to `` newsweek ''
0 0 well , i am a lawyer , but i do n't want to play one on tv .                        
1 1 let 's leave that to the lawyers .                                            
1 1 because it 's not simply this very hard to prove 1982 ...                                    
1 1 no , i 'm just saying what he ...                                          
1 1 ... intelligence identity protection act ... .                                              
0 1 ... what karl -- what karl said or did n't say ...                                    
1 1 ... at stake here .                                                  
1 1 it 's a lot of other laws .                                            
0 0 ... yes , but what karl said or did n't say , when it comes to the outing of valerie plame , he clearly had no role , which is
0 0 that 's simply not true .                                                
1 1 in fact , the evidence that we have is that he played a central role .                            
1 0 whether or not he was the source for mr. novak , we do n't know ...                            
0 0 we 're going to go red hot after this .                                        
0 0 i think this goes on .                                                
0 0 here 's why .                                                    
1 0 independent of the grand jury , there is still the political and the policy machinery .                            
1 1 if republicans believe that rove is hurting them , if democrats believe they can wrap karl 's problems together with tom delay 's , with duke cunningham 's -- the
1 1 but paul , you ...                                                  
0 0 ... then you 'll see the republicans turning on karl , and turning on mr. bush .                          
1 1 well , paul is exactly right to this degree , that the democrats are not just eager , they are desperate to find a second-term scandal .      
0 1 and they 're trying desperately to make this the second term scandal .                                  
0 0 all right , i think let 's call a time out there .                                  
0 0 the vacancy in the supreme court was the topic , finding a replacement for sandra day o'connor , as the president sat down with senate leaders from both sides of
0 0 will that meeting move the process forward ?                                            
0 0 that 's coming up when `` strategy session '' continues .                                      
0 1 stay with us .                                                    
1 0 and now to the process to fill the open seat on the u.s. supreme court .                            
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues with paul begala and rich galen .                                  
1 1 a replacement for retiring justice sandra day o'connor .                                          
0 0 the senators offered suggestions , but what the president wanted to most was how quickly the confirmation process could be .                  
0 0 obviously , they get to decide .                                              
0 1 they 're the legislative branch .                                                
1 1 they get to determine how fast to move a nominee 's name or not .                              
0 1 our -- my only question to them is : what will it take to be able to get a person confirmed by early october ?          
1 0 the president says he 's closer to a decision , but did n't offer any suggestions of his own to the senators .              
0 0 the senate minority leader does n't foresee a quick process .                                      
1 0 we have a long ways to go .                                            
0 0 the president has thousands of names that i 'm sure -- add least hundreds of names that he will go through .                
0 0 hundreds of names .                                                    
1 0 harry reid says the president did n't offer any names .                                      
0 1 i want to ask you both and we 'll start with you rich galen : how much does it factor into the equation , the expectation at the white house
0 0 and could have three if they decide to promote antonin scalia , then you 've got three .                        
0 1 you 've got a supreme court chief justice and then two associate justice .                                
0 0 so , i think that factors a good deal and i suspect they want to see -- and my guess is somebody is talking to chief justice rehnquist to see
0 0 i think the interesting thing about today was this , two things : one , in the photo ops that the president had following that , he mentioned -- he
0 0 the senators came in to advise me .                                            
0 0 so , he 's got on the record , that of advise and consent phase , he 's already done the advise thing .            
0 0 he 's covered that part , which i thought was pretty interesting .                                  
1 0 the other thing is , that i do n't think both either harry reid or bill frist , can afford to let this thing spin out of control again ,
0 0 i think they need to keep control of this thing , and what they 're doing now , is sort of playing chess both with each other , but with
0 1 but those three players : the president , dr. frist -- senator frist , the republican leader , and senator reid have completely different agendas .        
0 0 you know , the president has won his reelection and he wants to secure his place in history and ideology in a legitimate way by appointing members of court who
0 0 senator reid is holding his democrats and so far , they 've been more united than anytime in my memory -- probably since lbj .          
0 0 he 's probably the most unifying democratic leader in the senate since johnson .                                
0 0 everybody is sticking with harry reid .                                              
0 0 bill frist is running for president .                                              
0 0 he seems unable to hold the republicans together very well .                                      
0 0 the president will likely deliver most of the republicans anyway .                                      
1 1 he seems more interested , frankly , in kind of giving talking points to james dobson and the social- conservatives , to please them .          
0 0 and i think he 's going to have the hardest time of this .                                
0 0 let 's stop .                                                    
0 0 let me interrupt you for one second .                                            
1 1 i want you to listen to something senator frist said on the floor today .                              
0 1 he comes out of this meeting , obviously wants to frame the stakes and he thinks , senator frist making the case , the democrats are asking for too much
0 1 co-nomination rather than consultation , may be their ultimate goal .                                      
1 1 some senators may prefer to choose the nominee for the president , but that 's not the way the system works .                
0 0 that 's not the way the constitution works .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 i wrote ...                                                      
0 1 so ...                                                        
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 i wrote a column of a couple of weeks ago when we were doing the circuit court nominees , and i said one of the compromises that senator reid presented
1 1 so , i think that 's what senator frist was alluding to , but you know , this was just the staking-out-the-position stuff .            
1 0 this will get -- i will be very surprised if this thing turns into the bloody battle that , frankly , those of us that have to write three days
0 0 this actually -- this speech that made me think that dr. frist is getting his talking points from dr. dobson , one of -- james dobson , the leader of
0 0 well , they work too much .                                              
1 0 democrats are n't asking for more .                                              
0 1 now , in fact , orrin hatch as we now know -- orrin hatch , the republican senator did veto some of clinton 's judges , but he was in
1 0 let 's move past how , to who .                                          
0 0 listen to this from senator pat leahy , the ranking democrat on the committee .                              
1 1 i 've talked , as each of us have , with a number of the current justices .                        
0 0 i know they see a number of benefits that could come to having somebody from outside the judicial monastery .                    
0 1 rich galen .                                                      
1 0 outside the monastery .                                                    
0 1 go to somebody with elected experience ?                                              
0 0 i thought he said jewish monastery .                                              
0 0 i wanted to go to see one of those .                                        
0 1 you know , one of the problems that we have with this things -- and the same thing obtains when we 're talking about the presidential sweepstakes -- is that
0 0 so -- but there 's a lot of people both judges and lawyers , maybe college presidents , who knows , but i suspect that to put this in ,
0 0 you may need a running back , but if the best available athlete is a , you know , a safety , you pick that .        
1 1 and i suspect that 's what the president 's doing .                                      
0 0 i would n't be surprised if it was somebody that none of us have ever heard of , because it 's not what we do for a living .  
0 0 but i think -- he has a point and i know , because i 've talked to some people who 've talked with supreme court justices .      
0 0 members of the court have gone to senators and said : we want a practical politician .                          
0 0 and there 's good reason for that .                                            
0 0 justice o'connor is the only person on the court today -- and she 's retiring -- who has ever run for office .              
0 0 remember sam rayburn famously said of kennedy 's geniuses , `` i wish one of them had ever run for sheriff just once . ''          
0 0 well , o'connor is the only justice today who 's ever run for sheriff .                              
0 0 she was a real politician and i think she brought a different perspective .                                
0 0 hugo black , earl warren and o'connor , they had all been real politicians .                              
0 1 when i was working the white house , i wanted president clinton to appoint somebody like mario cuomo , tom foley , the former speaker of the house , bruce
0 0 they would would have brought a completely different perspective and so i hope the president listens to the court and to leahy .              
1 1 it should n't be the only qualification , but judd gregg 's name came up .                            
0 0 harry reid , of all people , the democratic leader , floated judd gregg 's name -- a very conservative senator from new hampshire .          
1 1 that 's what i meant by the best available athlete .                                      
1 1 it may not be somebody from the circuit court .                                        
0 0 right .                                                        
0 1 ok. we 'll stop that discussion now .                                            
0 0 i know you 're a lawyer , but you 're not on the list .                              
0 0 sorry .                                                        
1 1 in the week after a deadly attack on mass transit in britain , congress looks at protecting the people who ride the rails here and how much money is spent
0 0 that 's coming up next in `` strategy session . ''                                      
1 0 i 'm wolf blitzer in washington .                                              
0 1 coming up at the top of the hour , london police report progress in their investigation into last week 's terror attack : why it may have been the work
0 0 did karl rove reveal the identity of a cia operative ?                                      
0 0 republican party chairman ken mehlman , himself a former top rove deputy at the white house , standing by to answer my questions .            
0 0 and nasa prepares for the first shuttle launch since the colombia disaster .                                  
0 0 we 'll talk with the shuttle program manager , william parsons .                                    
1 1 all of those stories , much more , only minutes away on `` wolf blitzer reports . ''                        
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 and our `` strategy session '' continues now on inside politics .                                    
1 0 still here with us -- i think i owe them a meal , paul begala and rich galen .                      
1 0 congress is looking at the budget for homeland security department this week and in light of last week 's london bombings , that left more than 50 people dead ,
0 0 osama bin laden understands that those who want to attack us , other than him , understand this gaping hole and it is long since time that this administration took
0 0 rich galen , homeland security , the whole war on terrorism has been the president 's trump card since 9/11 .                  
1 0 democrats getting in his face .                                                
0 0 i assume they see an opening .                                              
0 0 well , they might -- but they done this before and they 've talked about this before and there is something to be said for it .      
0 1 i mean , but there is -- it always comes down to an appropriations , give and take , switch and not switch and : what do you want to
0 0 i mean , when we upgraded the security around airports , people complained and moaned and carried on ; still do to this day .          
0 0 i ca n't imagine new yorkers being subjected to having their backpacks searched going onto the bmt .                        
0 0 i mean it 's just not going to happen .                                        
0 1 so , there 's only so much you can do .                                      
0 0 should they do more ?                                                  
0 0 probably .                                                        
1 0 i do n't think there 's any -- but the congress get 's to do this .                          
0 0 the congress gets to put the numbers in .                                          
1 0 you talked earlier , paul , you talked about congress will be suffering in this bad environment right now .                    
0 1 is this the democrat 's strategy for the midterm elections : wrong war on terrorism ; wrong priorities , wrong spending ?                
0 1 now .                                                        
0 0 i think this is much more their substantive problem .                                        
0 0 i think they have a political agenda on a host of issues .                                  
0 0 i think this is a regional as well as partisan , dispute and those things come together now .                      
0 0 the country is divided , but we 're pretty neatly divided regionally .                                  
0 0 and where there are a lot of mass transit areas , there are a lot of democrats .                        
1 1 and it 's partly congress ' fault , partly the white house 's fault , but a lot of democrats believe that the funding formula for this is skewed in
0 0 places like new york city ...                                                
1 1 what would you do ?                                                  
1 0 spend money to do what ?                                                
0 0 i -- well , more on the mass transit , more on ports , more on subways .                        
1 0 not just more , but what would you do ?                                        
0 0 what would you do ?                                                  
1 0 the president 's theory has been : we 'll fight them there instead of here .                            
1 0 the problem is the terrorists have not agreed to our strategy .                                    
1 1 that 's wrong .                                                    
1 0 they 're fighting us here and there .                                            
1 0 no , no , no .                                                
1 1 and i thin we could do a lot more .                                        
0 0 imagine how many more terrorists attacks we might well have , if they had free reign in afghanistan and iraq to train ...              
0 0 we 're not disputing about the war in afghanistan .                                        
0 0 this is the war in iraq .                                              
0 1 but i guess the theory is that they 're cutting my taxes -- we 're all rich , they 're cutting our taxes and so , when the terrorists kill
0 0 i 'd rather be alive .                                                
1 1 that 's the government 's first job -- is to protect me .                                  
1 1 cut my taxes later , save my life first and i do n't think we 're doing nearly what we ought to do on homeland security .      
1 1 but just saying we 're going to spend more money is a classic ...                                
1 1 it worked against the soviet union .                                              
1 0 we did n't just spend more money , we spend it on things like ...                              
0 0 we spent them into oblivion .                                                
1 1 i guarantee you were against president reagan 's star wars , which is what ultimately lead to their collapse .                    
0 0 i guarantee you were against that .                                              
0 0 i was skipping school and drinking beer in college .                                        
1 0 i did n't know about star wars .                                            
0 1 i did n't know , that was before my time .                                      
0 0 and on that very substantive note , we will end today 's `` strategy session . ''                          
0 0 rich galen , paul begala , thank you both very much .                                    
0 0 the blogosphere is more than serious political debate .                                          
0 0 up next , we rejoin our blog reporters to sample some political humor online .

    on debate day , this is the biggest question -- is it too late for republicans to dump trump ?                    
    i do wish that mike pence was at the top of the ticket .                                
    it is tragic the way it is right now .                                        
1 1 caught on tape , bragging about repeatedly groping women --                                        
1 0 when you 're a star , they let you do it .                                    
0 0 you can do anything .                                                  
0 0 i 've never said i 'm a perfect person , nor pretended to be someone that i 'm not .                    
1 1 his late night apology only adds to the outrage .                                        
1 0 this is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today .                            
1 1 four weeks left , the race already moving hillary clinton 's way and now at crunch time , a trump campaign and republican party in chaos .      
1 1 let me just start off by saying there is a bit of an elephant in the room and it is a troubling situation .            
1 1 inside politics , the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters , now .                                
0 1 welcome to inside politics .                                                  
0 0 i 'm john king , live from washington university in st. louis , inside the debate hall , the site of tonight 's second presidential debate .      
0 0 thanks for sharing your sunday morning as we go where no campaign has gone before .                            
0 1 donald trump says he will never quit the race for president , but as we count down 13 hours now to tonight 's debate , there are serious conversations at
1 1 and i was offended and dismayed by -- by what was said and done by mr. trump .                        
0 0 i think it 's degrading to our women , to our daughters , our granddaughters , to future generations .                    
0 0 and i dearly hope that we will come together as a nation and stand as firmly as we possibly can for the principles that have made us the shining city
1 1 now trump for his part shows no signs of understanding the gravity of the moment or of his conduct , caught on tape bragging about repeated behavior that constitutes sexual
0 0 and yet it took hours for his staff to convince him this is a serious matter , that his campaign might collapse .              
0 1 even then , he could n't just say sorry .                                        
1 0 i pledge to be a better man and will never ever let you down .                              
0 0 let 's be honest , we 're living in the real world .                                  
0 0 this is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we 're facing today .                            
1 1 now , for most republicans , that apology , if you can call it that , made matte worse , though most believe with the election now 30 days away
1 1 my wife , my daughters , my mom , my sister and all women deserve better .                          
0 1 all americans deserve better .                                                  
0 0 i believe our only option is to formally ask mr. trump to step down and to allow republicans the opportunity to elect someone who will provide us with the strong
1 1 with us to share their reporting and their insights , dan balz at `` the washington post '' , cnn 's maeve reston , cnn 's nia-malika henderson , and
0 0 let 's just start with the wow .                                            
0 0 dan , been at this a while .                                            
0 0 we were talking before we came on the air , never seen a day like yesterday , never seen 72 hours like we 've been through here .    
0 0 the conversations yesterday , can we dump him ?                                          
0 0 can we force him out ?                                                
0 0 what if we did ?                                                  
0 0 trump says no and never .                                                
0 0 where are we today as we prepare ?                                            
0 0 there 's supposed to be a debate between the two candidates .                                    
0 0 we 're supposed to talk about , you know , what issues are going to come up and what 's the biggest stake of the debate ?      
0 0 instead , we 're talking about chaos in the republican party and questions about whether trump can survive this .                    
1 1 well , it 's total chaos within the republican party but it 's not clear there 's anything that can be done other than what we saw yesterday , which
0 0 that may be the most they can do , but it 's a very delicate balance that they 're wrestling with .                
0 0 i mean , the legal issues are difficult in terms of getting him off .                              
0 0 he has to step aside .                                                
0 0 they ca n't force him off .                                              
0 0 even if that were to happen , there are ballots that have already been printed , there are ballots that have already been cast with his name on them .
0 0 so , there 's no practical way to really substitute somebody else for it .                              
0 1 so , the question is do they distance themselves in a way that saves the party or do they distance themselves in a way that destroys the party ?  
1 1 and one of the most fascinating things yesterday was his running mate , mike pence would not go to that event .                
0 0 we showed paul ryan in the open .                                            
0 0 he would not go there .                                                
0 0 mike pence essentially saying he wants to give donald trump 24 to 48 hours to figure this out for himself .                  
0 0 but mike pence saying in a statement , `` i do not condone his remarks and can not defend them .                  
0 0 i 'm grateful he 's expressed remorse and apologized to the american people . ''                              
0 0 but to have your running mate , `` i can not condone his remarks and can not defend them . ''                  
0 0 mike pence has done a lot of defending , a lot of cleanup in this campaign , this one 's pretty striking .              
1 0 how do you like that for a buddy movie , huh ?                                    
0 0 it 's like `` lethal weapon '' where mel gibson leaves after the first scene .                            
0 0 i mean , pence has really -- this was an issue at the vice presidential debate -- pence is doing an extraordinarily adept job of keeping his own image clean
0 1 this is -- it 's fascinating sort of watching this guy maneuver himself .                                
0 0 we did some reporting , my colleague and i , that pence has actually been talking to trump , giving him advice .              
0 0 i would love to be a fly on the wall of those conversations , but he has n't been included necessarily even in any of the real debate sessions .
0 0 so , these are two running mates who are n't exactly mates .                                  
1 1 i mean , the fact that mike pence did not go to that event in wisconsin after donald trump and his statement on friday night said pence would go in
0 0 nia-malika henderson , cnn senior political reporter : yes .                                        
0 1 you have                                                        
0 0 people now saying donald trump should step aside and pence should go in his place .                            
0 0 again , as dan explained , that 's likely not to happen .                                  
0 0 the ballots are already printed .                                                
0 0 and pence has been in this odd position , right , in that last debate , confronted with some of donald trump 's more off color remarks .    
0 0 he would just shake his head .                                              
0 0 but he had for a while vouched for donald trump 's character , certainly to evangelicals .                          
0 0 he 's called him a good and decent man , so now , what ?                              
0 1 i think a lot of people are waiting on what comes out of this debate .                            
0 0 it 's like they 're in a holding pattern to see what comes out of this debate .                        
0 0 and we should all remember also that these are not two men who knew each other well before this partnership .                  
0 0 i mean , this was like -- right ?                                          
0 0 so , mike pence does have some firm ground to stand on there , maybe there were a lot of things in donald trump 's past that he did n't
1 0 but i also think there 's a question about what happens 48 hours from now with mike pence ?                      
0 1 mike pence can go underground now and let donald trump try to work himself out of it , see what happens in this debate tonight .        
1 1 republicans saying pence should withdraw .                                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 can you imagine kelly ayotte who in new hampshire who is in an extraordinarily difficult position ?                          
0 0 seventy-two hours ago , she said during the debate that donald trump was a role model for children and to walk that one back , run that one back .
0 0 but can you imagine how donald trump feels right now looking at news reports where other republicans are begging for mike pence instead of him ?        
1 0 and what -- how does that affect his mood when he comes into this debate ?                            
0 1 i 'll just show the front page of `` the st. louis dispatch '' as we do this , his last stand , i said , that 's a fair
0 0 get into the polling .                                                  
0 0 this was a big debate before this tape came out , the polls have trending hillary clinton 's way .                    
0 1 she had clear momentum .                                                  
0 0 now , a lot of people are saying , why this ?                                    
0 0 donald trump has said so many controversial things throughout the campaign , a lot of people say , why is this ?                
0 0 why is this the issue that pushed republicans over the top ?                                    
0 0 why is this the issue that have republicans saying he should drop out or at least from him as fast as they can ?            
0 0 let 's first listen .                                                  
0 0 remember , this was 2005 , he 's doing an interview with billy bush of `` access hollywood . ''                    
0 0 listen to just a snippet .                                                
0 0 we 'll get to more of it later .                                          
0 0 but here 's just the snippet .                                              
1 1 i moved on her very heavily .                                              
0 0 in fact , i took her out furniture shopping .                                        
0 0 she wanted to get some furniture .                                              
0 0 i 'll show you where there 's some nice furniture .                                      
0 0 i took her out furniture .                                                
0 0 i moved on her like a bitch .                                            
0 0 i could n't get there .                                                
0 0 she was married .                                                    
0 0 i see her she now has the big phony tits .                                      
0 0 she 's totally changed her look .                                              
1 0 i should have at the beginning said what you 're about to hear is some graphic language and i apologize for not saying that in advance .      
0 0 that 's one of the tamest parts .                                            
0 1 that 's one of the tamest parts of this tape here .                                    
0 1 and the point if you go on in this tape , that 's talking about making unwanted advances on a married woman , and you heard the language in it
0 0 if you go on in this tape and we 'll play some of this later , he also talks about conduct that is a crime .        
0 0 if he did it , people go to jail for the things that he was talking about doing , and groping women .              
0 0 that was the dam opening .                                                
1 1 yes , absolutely .                                                    
0 0 i mean , that 's why you saw particularly people like kelly ayotte and other women in congress come out so strongly : i mean , there was this irony
0 0 and then , you know , two hours later , the republican party is having to deal with this .                    
0 0 i think that , you know , the fact that it $ was n't just those kinds of -- that locker room talk that we just heard a moment ago
1 0 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 the fact that it 's on tape , the fact that he is there joking act it as well .                    
0 0 in many ways , he ends up tonight where he began , if you remember that first debate , some of the first questions from megyn kelly were about his
0 0 he said it was only rosie o'donnell , but now he is in a much precarious position .                        
0 0 not only have the polls drifted away from him in terms of real constituencies , even working class white voters , peeling away some support and going to hillary clinton
0 0 but i think maeve is right , it 's the specter of sexual assault , right , him essentially saying that his wealth gives him permission and access .  
1 1 and saying he 's repeatedly done it .                                            
1 1 he 's got the tic tacs , right ?                                          
0 0 he 's preparing forward in that moment .                                            
1 0 in his video released saturday , after it took his aides hours to convince him this was a big deal .                  
0 0 that 's important here too .                                                
0 0 it took him hours to convince him this was a big deal , he does n't say in the video that i never did this .        
0 0 he never says he never did this .                                            
0 1 he 's bragging about -- i 'm going to say it one more time -- he 's bragging about things that people go to jail for .      
0 0 i 've been on a lot of locker rooms .                                        
0 1 men say stupid things in locker rooms .                                            
0 0 men say inappropriate things in locker rooms .                                            
0 1 men do not talk about committing crimes in locker rooms or if anybody brings it up the grownup in the team tells him to shut up .      
1 1 well , one of the things that i 've really noticed is the difference between the way that men and women are responding to this tape .      
0 0 when i saw it , i thought this confirms a lot of my worst suspicions .                            
0 0 it 's obviously full of really salty language and i was looking at the political implications .                          
0 0 when i 've spoken to the women who i work with and the women in my life about this , there 's a real sense of disgust .    
0 0 it does n't just to do with the fact that this was a crime .                              
0 0 it has a sense -- there 's a sense of depression that at this particular point in the country 's history that we 're still having this kind of nonsense
1 1 he says --                                                      
1 1 the irony of this .                                                  
0 0 i mean , we were in a year in which there was so much attention focused on the fact that hillary clinton was the first female , you know ,
1 0 yes , he 's bringing the gender card into this in a way that she is n't .                        
1 0 but i also think it 's important to think about this in the context of where we are in this country .                
0 0 i mean , ten years ago the reaction to this would have been less severe for donald trump .                      
0 0 the sensitivity to this issue is much more significant and important , and i think that tells us there 's been an important and significant positive movement in the country
0 0 and i think that the revulsion that you 're talking about particularly among women but among men also tells us that we are in a different place .    
1 0 much , much more to talk about on this issue including how donald trump handles it behind me here , when he 's on this stage hours from now ,
0 0 the race was already trending clinton 's ways before this trump bomb shell .                                
0 0 we map out the debate stakes next .                                            
0 0 but , first , politicians say the darndest things courtesy of `` saturday night live '' --                          
1 1 i deeply apologize .                                                    
1 0 are you trying to say apologize ?                                              
1 1 no , i would never do that .                                            
0 1 what i am doing is apologizing to all the people who are offended by my statements , but more importantly , to the people who were turned on by them
0 0 i hear it 's really 50-50 .                                              
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 it is hard to overstate the stakes for donald trump heading into night 's second presidential debate .                        
0 0 even before his caught on tape crisis , the race was trending hillary clinton 's way .                          
0 0 let 's take a look .                                                
0 0 this our national poll of polls , an averaging of all the national polls conducted in recent days , these are all since the first debate .      
0 0 and , look , hillary clinton with a four-point lead over donald trump nationally .                              
0 1 you see the third party candidates pulling a combined 10 percent .                                    
0 1 now , you might say , four points that 's not much , and you 're right , it 's not that much .            
0 0 but let 's go back and look at time .                                        
0 0 remember , 2012 was actually a pretty competitive race .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton today in better shape than president obama was at this point in 2012 .                            
0 0 thirty days out , that 's where we are today , president obama had a slim one-point lead over mitt romney .                
0 0 the day of the second debate the debates were later four years ago .                                
0 0 it was october 16th .                                                  
0 0 the two candidates were actually tied on the day of the second debate .                                
0 0 so tied in this race a four-point lead in this race , no question , secretary clinton right now in a better position at this point of the race than
0 1 now , this is our current electoral map .                                          
0 0 if the election were held today , we believe secretary clinton would win the dark blue and blight blue states , and had enough to be president .    
0 0 the gold states are the remaining tossup states .                                          
0 0 even if donald trump won tossups , it was n't enough .                                    
0 0 he would have to turn something on this map that is blue red .                                
0 0 and guess what ?                                                    
0 0 just in the last weeks , polls in nevada showing clinton ahead .                                  
0 0 polls in ohio , a tight race , but the latest has clinton with a small lead .                        
0 0 polls showing clinton pulling slightly ahead in north carolina and in florida .                                  
0 0 at the moment , donald trump needs to win them all , she 's leading in them all .                      
0 0 you can not overstate the stakes tonight for trump .                                        
0 0 his team scheduled a practice session the other day in new hampshire .                                  
0 0 trump insists that 's not what it was at all .                                      
1 1 they were saying this is practice for sunday .                                          
0 0 this is n't practice .                                                  
0 0 this has nothing to do with sunday .                                            
0 1 we 're just here because we just wanted to be here and , you know , hillary frankly they talk about debate prep .            
0 0 that 's not debate prep .                                                
0 0 she 's resting .                                                    
0 0 she 's resting .                                                    
0 0 i want to be with the american people .                                          
0 0 i want to be with the people from new hampshire .                                      
0 0 and she wants -- she wants to win .                                          
1 0 now , let 's remember that event was before this whole caught on tape moment broke , even before that , the stakes were pretty high tonight .    
0 0 what does donald trump say behind us on this stage tonight when this issue comes up ?                          
0 1 i assume it comes up out of the gate .                                        
1 1 well , i mean that that 's what they have been huddled trying to figure out over the last 24 , 48 hours .            
0 0 but this is not an easy format .                                            
0 0 i mean , the town hall format first of all the town hall he had in new hampshire the other night was not a town hall by any stretch of
0 0 you do n't get like hand-fed friendly questions at a new hampshire town hall .                              
0 1 but there are so many things that you have to do in this kind of format .                          
0 1 you have to appeal to the audience members .                                          
0 0 you have to show empathy .                                                
0 1 you have to at the same time land your attacks on your opponent , and donald trump has this whole overlay of potentially questions about this coming up throughout the
1 0 can he go where he 's gone in some of these statements ?                                  
0 1 in his first paper statement --                                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 -- issued by the campaign and then in the video he released and twice retreated -- retweeted excuse me a woman who says 30 plus years ago bill clinton sexually
0 0 can he do that ?                                                  
0 1 i understand some people feel past and everything , but the question before us today is his behavior .                      
1 1 i mean , he can do that , right ?                                        
0 0 i mean , he certainly has done it off stage .                                      
0 0 the people around him , people like roger stone , people like bannon , people like rudy giuliani , it seems like their instinct will be to go there .
0 0 we 'll hear from rudy giuliani later today .                                          
0 1 i think kellyanne conway has n't been out in public talking about this .                                
0 0 he 's done things unexpectedly before , right ?                                          
0 0 i mean , he 's very unpredictable .                                            
0 0 but again , i think to maeve 's point , it 's so hard to do that .                        
0 1 it 's also a matter of we 're in a different time , right ?                              
0 0 bill clinton he was impeached .                                                
0 0 he was highly scrutinized .                                                  
0 0 he paid something of a price for that and to bring that up now , it does n't take away blame from donald trump .          
1 0 and think about all of those reaction shots in the town hall tonight .                                
0 1 i mean , this is not a warm donald trump crowd .                                    
0 0 these are undecided voters who are coming there to pose questions to candidates .                                
0 0 and the people at home , you know , if he were to go on that kind of an attack are going to be watching those people in the audience
0 0 i do n't think that that can be discounted in terms of how that affects his performance .                        
1 1 i do n't think -- i do n't think we should assume that he wo n't do it .                      
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but i think that we should assume that if he does , it could cost him more support among the republican rank and file as well as the rank --
0 1 it 's a very dangerous thing for him to do this .                                    
0 0 i know that they would like to do this .                                        
0 0 they clearly want to go in that direction .                                          
0 0 they want to turn this against her .                                            
0 0 not just against bill but against hillary clinton and talk about her as an enable of bill clinton 's behavior .                  
0 0 but it 's so difficult for him to do that .                                      
0 0 i do think -- i mean , we have this notion that the town hall debates are constricting .                      
0 1 i have a feeling that this will be less constricting in part because i think both anderson cooper and martha raddatz who will be moderating , they will be players
1 0 but i also think he is such limited political performer .                                      
0 0 i mean , we tend to sort of think of him as being this sort of consummate showman .                      
0 0 but , you know , this is not an environment unless the rules have change where you can remove dissenters from the crowd necessarily , right ?      
0 0 this was sort of his favorite technique to deal with that , and talking to the republicans over the last couple days .              
0 0 there was feeling maybe 24 hours ago , before the cascade of defections , that if he really appeared on bended knee and really expressed deep contrition about this and
0 0 so , he can not rebrand himself on the stage tonight .                                    
0 0 people wo n't let him do that .                                            
1 1 i think there 's another aspect to this , that is what happened in the first debate .                        
0 0 i mean , her ability to get under his skin time and time and time again , there 's no reason to expect she 's not going to try to
0 1 there 's so much in his head at this point .                                      
1 0 that 's what his advisers have been trying to dos to -- to the extent they can get him to prep for debates is to try to get him to
1 1 to do what pence did , when you ask him about something , you just turn -- pivot to e-mails , pivot to clinton foundation .        
0 0 the interesting thing also is that hillary clinton has not said anything publicly about this .                            
0 0 all she has done -- she did do a tweet i believe it was friday afternoon after the tape broke and said this is horrific .        
0 0 we can not allow this man to be president .                                        
0 0 but her campaign made a conscious decision not to put her out yesterday , to not have her say anything , because they saw that republicans were flailing their own
0 1 there 's not reason --                                                  
1 1 and they also kind of cautioned democrats not to get out there too far to let her have her first fulsome statement on this tonight on this stage .  
0 0 and in some ways that is what they 've done all along , right ?                              
0 1 if you think about august , they kind of just let donald trump be out there and hang himself .                    
0 1 even in that first debate between the two of them , she hung back .                              
0 0 i mean , she was almost operating about 30 percent and letting him just talk and talk and talk .                    
1 1 another quick point and we 'll talk more as we go through the rest of the hour , but as we talk about the metrics of campaign and the nuts
0 0 now , donald trump 's campaign promised well before all this happened , they were going to spend $ 100 million on television in the final days of campaign .
0 1 well , we can show you , they only reserved 45 million .                                  
0 1 they 've actually pulled back in some markets .                                          
0 0 there is not a chance donald trump will be able to raise the money to be competitive on television unless he finds a way to put this behind him .
0 0 you mentioned bended knee .                                                  
0 0 i was e-mailing with a bunch of donors yesterday , including people who loved her .                            
0 0 now , some of his biggest that said , we 're with him .                                
0 0 we 're gong to fight with him .                                            
0 0 but unless they 're willing to put up a lot more money , donald trump 's campaign was already in trouble with fundraising .            
0 0 and i can assume this is going to be a big problem .                                  
1 0 she raised 150 -- roughly $ 150 million in the month of august .                                
0 0 it was a high risk strategy .                                              
0 0 she really let him back into the game by going dark for most of the month of august .                      
0 0 but , you know , for example i was in colorado over the last couple of days and i had , of course , cnn on loop as always i
1 1 bless you , child .                                                  
1 1 and i saw a few hillary clinton ads and few generic gop ads .                                
0 0 i did not see a single donald trump ad .                                        
1 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 much more to talk about .                                                
0 1 donald trump says the reprehensible comments caught on tape are on aberration , not who he is .                        
0 0 we go through the tape library and you make the call next .

0 0 you know , i 'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- i just start kissing them .                            
0 0 it 's like a magnet .                                                
0 0 just kiss .                                                      
0 0 i do n't even wait .                                                
0 0 and when you start , they let you do it .                                      
0 0 you can do anything .                                                  
1 1 whatever you want .                                                    
1 1 grab them by the .                                                  
0 0 i can do anything .                                                  
1 1 trump initially brushed off that tape as just locker room talk between boys .                                
0 1 yes , he did .                                                  
0 0 then after hours of urgent meetings with his inner circle and a revolt across the party , a new statement released just after midnight saturday .        
1 0 i 've said and done things i regret and the words released today on this more than a decade old video are one of them .        
0 0 anyone who knows me knows these words do n't reflect who i am .                                
1 0 now if trump were in his 20s , maybe the decade-old thing might actually matter some , but he was 59 at the time .          
0 1 59 .                                                        
0 0 and the comments are n't just crude .                                            
0 0 they treat criminal behavior against women as a sport .                                        
0 0 you could hear him there and you can go online and listen to all of it .                          
0 1 as for the statement that these words do n't reflect who i am , well , we went through the tape library .              
0 1 the record might suggest otherwise .                                                
1 0 i said , how are you going to change the pageant ?                                    
0 0 i said , i 'm going to get the bathing suits to be smaller and the hells to be higher .                  
0 1 i view a person who 's flat-chested is very hard to be a 10 .                              
0 0 ok .                                                        
0 0 i 've been with women with extraordinarily bad breast jobs .                                      
0 0 you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes , blood coming out of her wherever .                      
1 1 simple question .                                                      
0 0 can donald trump make the case that that 's not who i am ?                                
1 1 no .                                                        
1 1 no .                                                        
0 1 right .                                                        
0 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 no .                                                        
0 0 it 's --                                                      
1 1 let me think about that .                                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 no .                                                        
1 0 and you know , he tried to do , well , this was part of my -- the entertainment portion of my life and i was just joking with my
0 0 but in this example , right , i mean , he 's -- this is him just talking and joking around with billy bush .          
0 1 so i think the entertainment excuse does n't fly anymore .                                      
0 1 but i also think this , i mean , in talking to some die hard trump supporters , they have been in the trenches with him all this time and
0 0 in fact , one lady i talked to in new hampshire she feels more energized for him now than she did before .              
1 0 but i was actually in colorado earlier this week , hiking with white suburban women , right , who are going to be the key factor , college educated ,
0 0 and so many of them were ready to accept , you know , past statements of his as show business , but there was so much frustration that they had
1 1 and they 're getting --                                                  
0 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 and they 're very much getting a signal from prominent women in congress .                                
0 0 there are six gop women senators , five of them have essentially parted ways with donald trump , asking him to leave the race , saying that they wo n't
0 1 and those are the kinds of women , of romney republican women , that in states like north carolina , that hillary clinton thinks she has an inroads and this
1 1 and me , i think you 're right that there are a lot of trump supporter who will not be moved away from him because of this and we 've
0 0 i mean , how many times have we overstated the impact of something he said or done that turned out not to be very significant in terms of his level
0 0 but as -- you know , as you made clear in going through the map , this is not a situation for him in which he simply has to hold
0 0 he 's got to -- he 's got to make up ground that he 's been -- they 've been losing over the last several weeks .      
0 0 and that under these circumstances becomes enormously difficult .                                          
1 0 yes , the defense --                                                  
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 it 's already losing now .                                                
1 0 very hard to gain on defense .                                              
0 0 just before you jump in , i just want to show this from our latest poll .                          
0 0 trump already had a gender gap .                                              
0 0 now he does very well with me , although hillary clinton after the first debate did close that a little bit .                
0 0 but look here .                                                    
0 0 clinton 53 , trump 40 .                                                
0 0 gary johnson and jill stein getting 4 percent combined at the bottom .                                  
0 0 she already had a 13 point advantage among women likely voters .                                    
0 0 it 's safe to assume in the immediate aftermath of these tapes anyway that that 's not going to get worse and many think it could actually -- for her
1 0 well , the interesting thing is , for all the talk about how unpredictable and dynamic the race is , donald trump has been stuck in just about the most
0 0 he is between 38 and 43 percent .                                            
0 0 he does n't really get beyond that .                                            
0 0 and what he needed to do , even during his best moment , his salad days of august , right , the guy did not push much past 42 percent
0 1 and the crossover aspect of this , the opportunity that he had in hofstra , that really was the moment in this campaign where he could have expanded and he
1 0 our k file team , recently hired here by cnn , was going through some other tape as well .                    
0 0 again to donald trump 's point that this was an aberration , he and billy bush essentially in a motor home looking out the windows , leering at women .
0 0 ok , gentlemen , that 's how we do that .                                      
0 0 but listen to this tape .                                                
0 0 this is another howard stern moment where donald trump is not only talking insensitively about women , this is his daughter he 's talking about .        
1 1 by the way , your daughter --                                              
1 1 she 's beautiful .                                                    
0 1 stern : can i say this ?                                              
0 0 a piece of .                                                    
0 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 the last couple of years i 'd go out with somebody and she 's like 21 and she 's talking about , you know , what are you doing ,
1 0 so what ?                                                      
1 1 it 's like -- it was always embarrassing for me to walk in .                                
0 0 it 's too young .                                                  
0 1 30 is like a perfect age .                                              
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
0 0 she had enough life experience .                                                
1 0 i thought she 's 35 .                                                
1 0 too much life experience .                                                  
1 1 what is it at 35 , howard ?                                            
0 0 it 's called check-out time .                                                
1 0 what is it at 35 , howard , it 's called check-out time .                                
0 0 that 's donald trump 's view of women .                                          
0 0 but earlier on in that interview , howard stern says , is it ok if i call your daughter a piece of -- i 'm not going to say the
1 1 i mean , the other person that we 've heard , you know , total silence from over this weekend is ivanka trump .            
0 0 i mean --                                                      
1 1 what can she say ?                                                  
0 1 she did an interview --                                                  
1 0 which is nothing .                                                    
0 0 nothing .                                                        
1 1 she did an interview with norah o'donnell , cbs news .                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 not that long ago where she said my father is not a groper .                                
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 1 now there 's a tape of her father bragging about being a groper .                                
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 and i mean , she was one of his most effective surrogates among women .                              
0 0 she was the one who was crafting his child care , elder care plans , and you know she has tried so hard to , you know , make the
0 0 and i mean , i just think there 's no -- there 's no way for her to come out and stay clean in this .        
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 and she , of course , is trying to maintain her brand , right ?                              
0 0 reston : right .                                                    
0 0 and grow her brand .                                                  
0 0 she sells $ 60 dresses in t.j. max and so that 's something she 's trying to do .                      
0 0 reston .                                                        
0 1 shoes .                                                        
0 0 shoes .                                                        
0 1 and she 's done these direct to camera ads about her father but , i mean , you hear that -- every single time it sounds disgusting and deplorable and
1 1 another big question , melania trump issued a statement saying what her husband said on that tape was offensive , but that she has accepted his apology and she hopes
0 0 it would be very interesting to see whether she 's here with him tonight in the hall .                        
0 0 we 'll see .                                                    
0 0 everybody , sit tight .                                                  
0 0 next , did hillary clinton really tell wealthy bankers they knew best about regulating wall street ?                          
0 0 hacked e-mails suggest she did and more .                                            
0 0 it 's often said that timing is everything in politics .                                      
0 1 well , donald trump is reminded of that lesson today .                                      
0 0 as is bernie sanders .                                                  
0 0 now the clinton campaign wo n't confirm the authenticity of what i 'm about to read but it also is n't denying that this comment about banking regulation , this
0 0 `` how do you get to the golden key ?                                        
0 0 how do we figure out what works ?                                            
0 0 and the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry . ''                    
0 1 that -- excerpt , excuse was in hacked e-mails of clinton campaign chairman john podesta back during the primaries when sanders was demanding clinton release transcripts of her paid speeches
0 0 now essentially she 's giving a speech to deutsch bank again if we believe this and the clinton campaign does n't deny it , essentially saying , you know ,
0 1 others could spin it as , of course , you 're not going to go to pre-med students to regulate the banking industry .            
0 0 but if this donald trump tape were not out , would we not be talking a lot more about these speech excerpts and hillary clinton 's at least some would
1 1 well , look , i mean , she is very fortunate that russian intelligence and julian assange do n't understand the difference between a primary and a general election .
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 1 because if this had been a march surprise , we might have a very different set of people standing on the debate stage tonight .          
0 0 i mean , this was really , really damaging stuff .                                      
0 0 you can explain some of this away .                                            
0 1 she 's kind of said this in public in a softer way and other things that she said .                      
0 0 the most damaging thing i thought that she said just in terms of a sound bite if trump were doing commercials was this notion that she could say things in
0 0 that confirms people 's worst fears about hillary clinton .                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
0 0 and that 's exactly the issue that , you know , all of these women , for example , who are not happy about either candidate say they just simply

0 0 so it does n't help her .                                              
0 0 but listen , i mean , how can donald trump make this case ?                                
0 0 i mean , i assume he 'll try to make it tonight , but he 's got so much of his own visceral type of baggage that it will be
1 1 right .                                                        
0 0 the idea of this e-mail was john podesta , the campaign chairman , asked campaign aides , go through these transcripts , just in case they do become public go
0 0 another thing that i bet donald trump does bring up tonight that in a speech to a brazilian bank in 2013 , she talked about the united states and then
0 0 `` my dream is a hemisphere common market with open trade and open borders . ''                            
0 0 conservatives have jumped on the open borders part .                                          
0 0 and i assume donald trump will try to make her answer for that tonight .                              
1 0 john , i did a search on friday afternoon after we heard about this on clinton open borders and almost everything that popped up were fact checks that said donald
0 0 now we have the evidence that she has said that .                                      
0 0 i mean , i think that this issue of where she stands on trade is an important one .                      
0 0 it will be an important one going forward .                                          
0 0 she has -- she has clearly moved on this issue .                                      
0 0 people think that she moved only for political reasons .                                        
0 0 she has n't explained this .                                                
0 0 i think this forces her at some point and perhaps tonight to be more explicit about if she 's changed , why she 's changed .        
0 0 what she said there .                                                  
0 0 did she really believe that and why .                                            
1 0 and i think -- and what dan is talking about , we have just formulated what would be , i think , probably the most plausible donald trump debate strategy
0 0 you know , if i were them , i would answer almost every question in the way that pence did referring to these hacked e-mails .        
1 0 forget pence , that was a strategy .                                            
0 0 a guy named william jefferson clinton used quite successfully in 1992 whenever his character has just came up , he 'd always say they 're trying to make this election
0 1 worked very well for him .                                                
0 0 the question is , can donald trump pull that off ?                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 and donald trump has tried that tone in some of his speeches when he 's been criticized in the past and , you know , saying that making himself the
0 0 so he will have to do that in a very clear way tonight .                                
1 1 i mean , the problem is donald trump is obsessed with himself , right ?                              
0 0 he always feels like he needs to defend himself .

0 0 her band is a little bit higher .

0 0 so it is a major distraction for him .                                          
0 0 and this sort of he said/he said with wildstein just adds one more layer to that .                          
1 0 and --                                                        
1 1 it 's kind of juvenile .                                                
0 0 i mean it 's bizarre to me that they would go after wildstein again in this e-mail blast yesterday .                    
0 0 it seems like it 's just all of the politics of high school instead of christie moving on to what he should be doing .          
0 1 you have to think about what hillary clinton is doing right now , which is going around the country , talking to donors in a very low-key settings and you
0 0 christie does n't have time for that .                                            
0 0 he 's got distractions at the rga and he 's just in a tailspin right now .                          
1 1 secretary clinton though peter hamby has the luxury of being a former .                                  
0 0 but he 's a sitting governor .                                              
0 1 so i 'm going to use bill clinton , not hillary clinton , as the analogy .                          
0 0 a lot of people attacked bill clinton when he was the governor of arkansas .                              
0 0 and i will say this for those of you who think governor christie is done , i 've been to a lot of bill clinton wakes .      
0 0 there 's never been a funeral -- you know there 's never been a funeral .                            
0 0 and he came back attacking -- this is what bill clinton did -- if you attack him , he attacked you bigger .              
0 0 but i do want to raise the question and the stakes for governor christie .                              
0 0 now let 's -- at the root of the issue where david wildstein says the governor was lying when they cut -- when the shut down the bridge -- that
0 0 governor christie says that 's not true .                                            
0 0 we 're going to go through months and months of investigations but this i talked to their four or five people here in washington , you know republicans around the
0 0 the donors call , do i support this guy ?                                        
0 0 one of them last night told me this , `` for the first time i 'm worried he may have to resign if this keeps spiraling out of control .
0 0 and i said resign from the republican governor 's association or resign as governor ?                              
0 0 he said well definitely the rga if this keeps going and maybe governor .                                
1 1 well this touches on what jonathan was just saying is that -- i was shocked and the biggest problem for christie to me i think in the short term until
0 0 we knew wildstein was sort of gaming to flip --                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 -- gaming to save himself .                                                
0 0 you know he did say that christie knew about the lane closures .                                  
0 0 but the reaction in the media was so big that when christie and travels around the country for the rga , the problem for him is going to be when
0 1 08:35:05 >                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 we do not want our state house reporters --                                          
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 -- in our states asking us these questions about your race .                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and your -- your job in new jersey when we 're trying to win re-election .                            
0 0 and that 's when the rga stuff comes in to -- into the fore .                              
0 1 and then also can -- what can he get done actually in new jersey legislatively .                            
1 0 and think about what a shift that is .                                          
0 1 he won a landslide reelection victory , he was the republican brand because the party out of power does n't have a face he became the brand , this guy
0 0 now , julie pace , some republicans are nervous and they 're beginning to look around .                          
0 0 and there 's this guy named jeb bush , he 's the former governor of florida -- the `` former '' part does help you sometimes .      
0 1 and so he 's been asked many , many times will he run in 2016 .                            
0 0 normally he says i 'll go away or i 'll comeback in a year .                              
0 0 this week he said this .                                                
1 0 i 'm deferring the decision to the right time which is later this year .                              
0 0 and the decision will be based on , can i do it joyfully , because i think we need to have candidates lift our spirits .        
1 0 something switched in jeb in the sense that instead of the push away , now he 's talking , a , about a timetable -- he 's actually thinking about
0 0 and b , thematic -- you have to be joyful , you have to get uplifted , you 've got to be optimistic .            
0 0 are republicans looking for another horse ?                                              
1 1 a lot of republicans are looking for another horse .                                        
0 0 a lot of republicans who have a lot of money in particular the donors are looking for someone who 's not chris christie .            
0 0 jeb bush has a lot of support in the section of the republican party that is more the chamber of commerce republican , the country club republicans who have always
0 0 they would love to see jeb bush run .                                          
0 0 i do think the great thing about jeb bush , is you know when he 's talking about this , i just keep thinking about barbara bush and her comments
0 0 and the reason i just think that comment is so interesting is because that 's how a lot of the public feels , too .          
0 1 they look at the clintons , they look at the bushes and they say really ?                            
0 0 is that it ?                                                    
1 1 at the same time --                                                  
1 1 hold on a second because his mother 's comment about not wanting jeb to run i do n't think is quite prohibitive .              
0 1 look i think it actually lets jeb bush say , ha-ha , i even have to convince my mom .                    
0 0 and second of all and more subtly -- reston : it 's always a good line .                          
0 0 second of all and more subtly it underscores the fact that this is not some sort of inside family deal to restore the bushes to power but in fact there
0 0 but that 's one --                                                  
1 1 i 've heard also over the last week that as this christie scandal has unfolded , that people on jeb 's team have been quietly reaching out to donors ,
0 0 and he 's not doing as much as he should be perhaps to reach out and feel what 's going on .                
1 1 the problem for jeb bush though is that he of all people knows that actually running for president is not joyful .                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 this is exactly right .                                                  
1 0 i think he 's in for a playlist yes .                                        
1 1 right and also think about this .                                              
0 0 i mean we 've all covered jeb bush recently when he 's given speeches .                              
0 0 he 's kind of hot and cold .                                            
0 0 there 's a lot of republicans who think , frankly , he 's rusty .                              
0 0 he has n't run for office since 2002 .                                          
1 0 he does not have his brother 's gifts in that regard .                                    
1 0 and his wife has something of an aversion to politics , yes .                                  
1 0 family issues .                                                      
1 0 think about george p. bush who might be actually the next heir-apparent in the bush family .                          
0 0 so he 's probably thinking about --                                              
1 1 you ca n't write off christie or jeb bush .                                        
0 0 there are already folks in politics who are saying what do we do if we ca n't nominate christie or jeb ?                
1 1 right and it 's unfair to christie in many ways , but you are innocent until proven guilty , we hold that to be true but in politics perception sometimes
0 0 and that 's i think the problem , for governor christie at the moment .                              
0 0 we 'll see how he handles it .                                            
0 0 everyone , stand by .                                                  
0 0 nancy pelosi says it 's a must ; organized labor says it 's a must .                            
0 0 but president obama says he 's not so sure .                                        
0 1 will this exclusive conversation with cnn open a democratic civil war on an issue that already divides the republicans ?                    
0 1 08:43:04 >                                                        
0 1 welcome back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 house speaker john boehner pushing his caucus now to pass a series of immigration reforms that would include legal status but not a fast track to citizenship for most of
0 0 improving the republican party standing with latino voters is a no brainer they ca n't win the white house unless they do that .            
0 0 but some conservatives look at the map this year and they argue acting now could actually hurt the party in the mid-term election year because turning out the conservative base
0 0 look at the map here , the more red you see the higher the latino population in these states .                    
0 0 now watch this .                                                    
0 1 see the blue lines ?                                                  
0 0 those are 11 states senate seats , now held by democrats that the republicans are targeting .                          
0 0 republicans need a net of six , plus six to take the senate majority .                              
0 0 look at states where the democrats are .                                            
0 0 you see any red ?                                                  
0 0 hardly right ?                                                      
0 1 a very tiny latino population in these states so the republicans who say do n't act now do n't want to anger conservatives in those states .      
0 0 in fact , west virginia , one of the targets , only one percent of the population is latino .                    
0 0 north carolina has the highest of those 11 target states with nine percent .                                
0 0 the conservative argument to the speaker is not this year mr. speaker .                                  
0 0 we need to turn out our base .                                            
0 0 we can worry about latinos later .                                              
0 0 that 's the republican side .                                                
0 0 we know democrats have benefited enormously from the republicans ' civil war in this issue .                            
0 0 but listen here will this exchange with cnn 's jake tapper put the democrats in a mess of their own ?                  
1 0 it 's possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in
0 0 would you veto that ?                                                  
1 1 well you know i 'm not going to prejudge what gets to my desk .                              
1 0 julie pace , so you cover the president every day .                                      
0 0 what 's he trying to do here , is he trying to cause a revolt in his own party or is he just trying to back off and let the
1 0 so this is a subtle but a pretty significant shift from the president who also the last year has said an immigration bill has to have a special pathway to
0 1 now he 's saying i would consider legalization which would be much more palatable to a lot of republicans .                    
0 1 08:45:00 >                                                        
0 1 it would mean that you could give these people legal status but not a special pathway to citizenship .                      
0 1 democrats on the left have said we want citizenship .                                        
0 0 republicans on the right have said we do n't want anything at all .                                
0 0 so the president is creating a bit of an opening here .                                    
0 0 does it clear the way for immigration to actually move forward on the hill ?                              
0 0 slightly but i do n't think we 're there .                                        
1 0 i think it 's a big `` if '' to house speaker john boehner .                              
0 0 and not just become of what he said .                                          
0 1 luis gutierrez is a liberal from chicago , big advocate of immigration reform --                                
1 0 -- and a huge critic of the president last time .                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 on this issue --                                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 -- he said friday in a conference call that he is basically ok with doing legalization .                          
0 0 the combination of that and this president saying this gives house democrats coverage before whatever boehner brings to the floor -- piecemeal , incremental , what have you -- they
0 0 that gives boehner space to get a bill passed .                                        
0 0 look president obama has never been a fan of what robert gibbs once called the professional left -- right .                    
0 0 he does n't care about these advocacy groups .                                          
0 0 this is a legacy issue for him .                                            
0 1 he wants to get a big piece of legislation on his desk in this term .                            
0 0 and even if it is sort of half a loaf on immigration , he 'll sign it .                        
1 0 but it 's a legacy issue or him .                                          
0 1 does a policy victory for the president and a legacy victory for the president -- what 's the political impact ?                  
0 0 if you have richard trumka , organized labor does n't matter as much as it used to but it matters --                  
1 1 it matters .                                                      
1 0 in a mid-term election year it is all about your base .                                    
0 0 he 's says it 's fool 's gold if you take legal status .                                
0 1 so he 's going to say to the president it 's just fool 's gold ?                            
1 1 it is also the president 's staffers are sort of -- i was at a breakfast this week with jason fuhrman who 's chief economic adviser who said we need
0 0 jay carney said the same thing but the president is out there .                                  
1 0 president himself has said it in the past .                                          
0 0 he 's actually splitting with himself .                                              
0 0 pace : but what you can do on the bill -- this is a policy matter -- is you could say this bill creates a legal framework for these people
1 0 so both sides would get what they want .                                          
1 1 let me play cynic -- let me play cynic for a minute because i think you may on this one .                  
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 the president could be backing off --                                              
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 -- because he wants the republicans to keep going .                                        
0 0 if the president says i 'll veto it , then the house conservatives might say let 's forget about it .                  
1 0 why not fan the flames of an internal fight in the republican party in an election year when they really should be talking about obamacare which is what they wanted
0 1 instead you 're going to have all these fractious fights , you know , within these primary races with tea party challengers coming up against establishment candidates .    
0 0 i just do n't think that the president had anything to lose by sort of leaving his options open , letting them fight it out .        
0 0 and i 'm very skeptical that anything really real will get done this year .                              
1 1 because even if the house passed status , then you have harry reid from nevada on the senate side saying i want citizenship or would they figure it out in
0 0 i think you could right .                                                
0 0 what did we learn about the president this week ?                                        
0 0 he gives -- this past week -- he gives the big state of the union address .                          
0 0 he travels the country .                                                  
0 0 it is supposed to be a time where he helps had his agenda and he helps his party but he goes to wisconsin .            
0 0 the candidate for governor does n't show up .                                          
0 0 on the night of the speech , a vulnerable democrat from alaska says sure , mr. president , come see me .                
0 0 not to campaign with me , i want to tell you how wrong you are .                            
0 0 mark udall , a gentleman senator from the state of colorado says i do n't know if i 'd campaign with the president .            
0 0 is he toxic in his own party ?                                            
0 1 let me ask the question this way -- sorry mr. president .                                    
0 0 is barack obama 2014 george w. bush 2006 ?                                          
1 1 well , if you look at poll numbers they certainly line up with bush at this point in his presidency .                  
0 0 i do n't think obama is toxic to his party at this point but it will be really interesting to see what his role becomes in 2014 .    
0 0 do these candidates want him out there at rallies ?                                        
0 0 do they want him facing voters or does he become the guy who just goes out and raises money for the party .              
0 0 if that happens then he 's increasingly irrelevant in his own party .                                  
1 1 i think this is -- what we saw this week is a chastened president , who basically admitted in his state of the union speech that he 's not as
0 0 but also i think in 2010 , if mark begich said what he said in 2010 , heads would have exploded at the white house .        
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 today , they kind of get it .                                            
0 0 his poll numbers are not as low as bush 's were just now in 2006 ?                            
0 0 but if he 's at 43 percent come november , and democrats are voting 43 percent of the vote in all of these senate races , it could be a
1 0 if you look at that senate map john that you showed on the screen , there 's not a lot of places this president can go and campaign for his
1 0 he wo n't be helpful .                                                
1 1 i think julie has it right .                                              
0 0 he 's going to do finance events in new york , chicago , d.c. , and the west coast and guess who 's going to be called out of the
0 1 bill and hillary clinton .                                                  
1 1 right and --                                                      
1 1 if you go back to 2010 in ohio , i remember being out in ohio and bill clinton and joe biden would be the ones that were going into youngstown
0 0 it was n't president obama .                                                
1 0 i mean the party has moved on .                                            
0 0 the activists have moved on .                                                
0 0 they are looking ahead to hillary clinton in 2016 .                                        
0 0 end of conversation .                                                    
1 0 but in a base election if people are showing disrespect to the african-american president does the african-american vote ?                      
1 1 that 's the challenge --                                                  
0 1 -- which is always talk in a mid-term and so that 's going to be the challenge .                        
0 1 08:50:03 >                                                        
0 1 and at least one key race that democrats think they actually have a shot to pick up a seat and that 's georgia .            
0 1 there 's no path for michelle nunn to win that seat unless she has a really sizable turnout in atlanta for african-americans .              
0 1 hamby : the issue is also troublesome for the president -- the keystone pipeline is something that progressives care deeply about .                
0 0 we saw this week that that might advance trade as an issue that flared this week a little bit .                    
1 0 and he 's having to step back from what his goals were .                                  
1 1 yes , absolutely .                                                    
1 0 so what does that mean with latinos ?                                            
1 0 he lost 2013 .                                                    
0 0 i mean if you go back and read his 2013 state of the union address and all the things he asked for , he got nothing .      
0 0 he 's essentially zero for 2013 on big items .                                        
0 1 so in 2014 , is it more about him -- his legacy because this could be his last legislative year , if you will , in his party even though
1 0 and this is something that this white house when you look at -- when you talk about the white house , they all want house democrats -- you know ,
1 1 sort of .                                                      
1 0 -- sort of .                                                    
0 0 they are never going to really put their ambitions and their agenda aside for the party .                          
0 0 that is not what they do .                                              
0 0 so when it comes to immigration , if you have some democrats out there saying , you know , let 's not finish it this year so we can use
0 0 they 're always going to go with the white house presidential legacy on this .                              
1 0 the republican presidential race starts november of this year after the election .                                  
0 0 so they probably -- democrats would like this issue --                                        
1 1 kind of .                                                      
0 0 i mean it 's only a primary -                                            
1 0 this is the pre-game show ?                                                
1 0 the pre-game show under way .                                                
1 0 yes , the pre-game show 's well under way .                                        
1 0 kind of like the super bowl pre-game show .                                          
0 0 it starts -- it lasts hours .                                              
0 0 what 's his role then ?                                                
1 0 the president ?                                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 well , i think he can raise money for his party .                                    
0 0 and i think , you know , you will see him out there pushing issues like minimum wage , like some of these issues related to women and politics ,
0 0 it 's used to turn out long democratic voters .                                        
0 0 but in terms of actually going to stump for a begich in alaska , a pryor in arkansas --                      
1 1 landrieu in louisiana .                                                    
1 0 landrieu , louisiana -- up in montana .                                            
0 0 the list goes on and on and on .                                          
0 1 i 'm just skeptical that he 's going to get those invitations , which is why to julie 's point , i think this president has to choose between a
1 0 in this past week the mood among democrats suddenly changed .                                      
0 0 they always thought they 're not going to get the house back .                                  
1 0 you feel it .                                                    
1 0 at least that week after the government shutdown -- that balloon , the air came out of it .                      
0 0 but the senate this past week all of a sudden democrats are saying `` we 're going to lose the senate . ''              
1 1 just as a mini-point though .                                                
0 0 i mean i think that what he was trying to do with women in the state of the union was really important .              
0 0 because if this year he can continue to push those issues that solidify democrats among independent women , they won by huge margins in 2012 , then that will be
1 0 it 's only february -- great election here to come .                                      
0 0 you want a peek at tomorrow 's news today ?                                        
0 1 our reporters empty their notebooks next .                                              
0 1 08:57:32 >                                                        
0 0 our goal here at inside politics : keep you ahead of the curve on the big washington and campaign stories so let 's take a peek into our reporters '
0 0 let 's go around the table .                                              
0 0 mr. hamby , you 're first .                                              
1 0 i 'm going to go to my favorite state of south carolina , as you guys know .                        
0 0 lindsey graham has a problem on the right but he has four challengers in his republican primary this year none of whom are considered top tier .      
0 0 i 'm hearing he is about to get a fifth , a preacher from colombia , and possibly a sixth .                  
0 0 at the same time lindsey and the seven dwarfs in this race .                                  
1 1 but that 's good news though for him , is n't it ?                                  
1 1 well , no .                                                    
0 0 i mean because it means that he -- it increases the chance of him making a run-off and having to run one-on- one against one of these people .  
0 0 still , there 's no top tier challenger in that race , he is vulnerable but no one has the money or the juice to beat him yet .  
1 1 fun , fun , fun and that 's only one of the republican races with interesting actually .                        
1 0 the president meets with senate democrats this week and a big part of their meeting is going to be planning a strategy for minimum wage .        
0 1 unlike the immigration debate where you 've seen the president kind of take a backseat .                            
0 0 he 's going to be really at the forefront of the minimum wage debate .                              
0 0 look for him to be hitting the road pretty soon going to states that have taken action on raising the minimum wage on their own .        
1 0 chris christie is not going to be the only pall at the super bowl tonight , the meadowlands .                      
0 0 mitt romney is going to be there with woody johnson --                                      
1 1 documentary storm -- romney .                                                  
1 1 exactly -- the jets owner , woody johnson , is hosting it for at the big game .                        
0 0 this to me is one more reminder that mitt romney misses being in public life .                            
0 0 he wants to be back in the game .                                          
1 0 how many interview has he done in the last few days .                                    
1 0 how far back in the game , may i ask ?                                      
0 0 this is the issue .                                                  
0 0 so he said to our ashley parker at `` the new york times '' -- no , no , no , no , no when he was asked about running
0 0 now here 's the question .                                                
1 1 no way .                                                      
0 0 i do n't believe it .                                                
1 1 how much of that though is his friends who want him to run again and how much of that actually is him ?              
0 0 there 's no question that he 's bored and misses it .                                    
0 1 but does he actually take the plunge for a third time ?                                    
0 0 it does seem unlikely .                                                  
1 1 i 'm going to say no to that .                                          
0 0 so today , this morning in new hampshire scott brown is doing the penguin plunge at hampton beach -- who knows how cold the water is there .    
0 0 he 's back in new hampshire and the internal polling is showing him and shaheen just a few points apart .                  
0 0 obviously the obamacare culture is looking really bad for her there .                                    
0 0 so i think it 's going to be fun to watch how she starts to distance herself from the president as we go into the 2014 races .    
1 1 all right .                                                      
0 0 i 'll just add this quick footnote jay martin 's point about the georgia senate race .                          
0 0 georgia governor , nathan deal , his handling of the snow storm down there has republicans nervous and of all places georgia in this election year .

sentence: 
    it 's been a long time 108 years .                                          
    to win a championship and so last night was very special on lots of fronts and who knows .                      
    maybe we 'll see even more history made in a few days .                                  
0 0 you know , the last time the cubs won , women could n't vote .                              
0 0 i think women are making up for that in this election .                                    
1 1 and here you see pictures of that parade of which i just spoke .                                
0 0 the chicago cubs marching through , driving through , chicago on the double-decker bus there celebrating , celebrating a well-deserved world championship .              
0 0 a fascinating world series here in the united states , the chicago celebrate and manu , gets a sentence or two because he 's mr. chicago .      
1 0 and celebrate -- celebrate last as a life-long and long-suffering cubs fan , this is one of my top five life moments .              
0 1 yeah , i 'll try not to pull a john boehner weep onset because i 'm a fan .                      
1 0 on behalf of red sox fans you 're welcome for theo .                                    
1 0 that 's all i thank you , i 'll remember that .                                    
1 0 remember red sox nations also broke their curse in a presidential year 2004 .                                
0 0 this is when these great things happen .                                            
1 0 but you see how on- message hillary clinton was there ?                                      
0 0 tie it back to the women 's vote ?                                          
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 tie it back to the women 's vote .                                          
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 in 2004 did n't the globe poll people on massachusetts the one where you have the red sox win or john carrey win , and it really was n't that
0 0 king : yeah , it was n't that much of a competition .                                  
0 0 teddy roosevelt was president of the united states the last time the cubs won the world series , so congratulations to the people of chicago .        
0 0 let 's get back to the election here .                                          
0 0 i want to show -- bring up for me if you can this `` washington post '' abc poll , the candidates on the issues .        
0 0 if you want to be convinced of how evenly divided america is , look at this .                          
0 0 on the issue of corruption , donald trump has an advantage , but on the economy , 47-47 , on terrorism , 49-45 , on hc healthcare , 49-48 ,
0 0 we live in -- this is why the election is relatively close heading to the final week .                        
0 0 and because we live in a country that is incredibly polarized and evenly divide on these issues .                        
0 0 the question i have , the concern , is have any of them actually been litigated ?                          
0 0 will the winner of this election be able to say the american people want me to do this on healthcare ?                  
0 0 the american people want this on the economy ?                                          
1 0 heck no .                                                      
1 0 this is all been about character .                                              
0 0 he 's unstable .                                                    
0 0 you ca n't trust him .                                                
0 1 she 's crooked and corrupt .                                                
1 1 yeah .                                                        
0 1 it 's divided -- been a policy debate .                                          
0 0 it 's been a personality debate .                                              
0 0 and that is why hillary clinton , one of the reasons why she was focusing a lot on the red states to flip those red states .      
0 0 she wanted to have a massive landslide win in the electoral college and say that the party , the country 's behind me .            
0 0 i have a mandate .                                                  
0 0 we should reform the immigration system , but if she limps to the white house , how do you make that case ?              
0 0 especially in the campaign that 's been all about trying to disqualify the other guy on personality .                        
1 1 yeah , personal case and one of the places she 'll be fighting for tonight is the state of michigan .                  
0 0 which again is been not since 1988 has michigan voted republican for president .                                
0 0 she still has a lead there it 's a little above five points .                                
0 0 she thinks she still has it , but she 's being extra cautious especially trying to drive up african- american turn out in detroit .          
0 0 mike pence , the republican vice presidential candidate is there today trying to make a direct blue collar appeal to one of the old days we would call reagan democrats
1 0 hillary clinton 's plan more of the same more taxes , more regulation , more of the kind of trade deals that are shipping jobs overseas .      
0 0 i mean more of the kind of policies that are stifling america 's economy on energy and more obamacare .                    
1 0 it 's the white --                                                  
1 1 one guy that actually talks about policy .                                            
1 0 he does n't need a prompter .                                              
1 0 even if he does n't get over the top on michigan we are , i think , seeing in this election , in historic reordering of the battlegrounds states .
0 0 historically democrats have done better since 1992 in the battleground states of the rustbelt , places like iowa , ohio , michigan , wisconsin and pennsylvania than they had in
0 0 in this election trump probably is going to flip ohio and iowa and he is absolutely battering at the doors in the other three with strength among blue collar workers
0 0 on the other hand , you know , you see a nevada , colorado and virginia where you have the combination of diversity and white collar whites moving more towards
1 0 and north carolina not far behind , florida not far behind .                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 even if she does n't go over the top in arizona and georgia , if she gets close , it signals where our politics is going and an older blue
1 1 i do n't think we have different candidate , though , running against trump that this could be an entirely different ball game on those states .      
0 0 i mean hillary clinton has never been able to find the right message , to target those voters and really connect with them in the way that , you know
1 0 would a popular set a better chance ?                                            
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 and i think i picture although some of it is just the basic demographics .                              
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 trump takes the trends and just turbo charge them .                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and so we mentioned these changes in these places .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton is going to be in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in just a short time today .                        
0 0 used to be a steel town .                                              
0 0 now it 's biomedical .                                                  
0 0 it 's a new economy in pittsburgh .                                            
0 0 pittsburgh 's coming back again .                                                
0 0 she is going to talk there but also mark cuban , the billionaire , she likes -- hillary clinton likes to question if mark cuban is a real billionaire ?
0 1 and so mark cuban were told is going to poke donald trump on , you know , you do n't pay your taxes you 're not really a billionaire ,
0 0 last night and i believe where was he last night ?                                      
0 0 north carolina , donald trump was standing in front of a bunch of american military heroes and listen to how we recast the word braver .        
1 0 there 's so much more brave than me i would n't have done what they did .                          
0 1 i 'm brave in other ways .                                              
0 1 i 'm brave -- i 'm financially brave .                                          
0 0 big deal , right ?                                                  
1 0 i think he 's trying to be funny .                                          
0 1 i think he 's trying to be funny but one of those lines that make you go ?                        
1 1 like yeah .                                                      
0 0 no .                                                        
0 1 a little off-message there .                                                  
0 0 north carolina i mean in terms of military bases , a really important state , they largest military base there , fort bragg .            
0 0 and in other states virginia , florida , big military population so smart of him to be talking to that ...                  
1 1 financially brave .                                                      
1 1 financially brave , he is not ...                                              
1 1 that underscores the fact that he 's a risk taker , unpredictable .                                  
0 0 all of those things he does n't want to reinforce right now .                                  
1 0 his brave enough to get good tax accounts and not pay his taxes .                                
0 1 what the democrats going to say about this .                                          
0 0 let 's close on this .                                                
0 0 we always talk about the obama coalition .                                            
0 0 he won two convincing presidential elections with young voters diversity , running it up with african-americans , running it up with latinos , college educated whites .      
0 0 her coalition is a little bit different .                                            
1 1 yup .                                                        
1 1 she expects african-american try no to drop a little bit because of loyalty for president obama , she 's hoping to do better among college educated white women impart because
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 here 's a little bit -- her surrogates on the road trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle .                  
1 0 i 'm not on the ballot this time .                                          
0 0 but fairness is on the ballot .                                              
0 0 decency is on the ballot .                                                
0 0 justice is on the ballot .                                                
0 0 all the progress we 've made is on the ballot .                                      
0 0 democracy 's on the ballot .                                                
1 0 this campaign is not a personality contest .                                            
0 0 we 're not voting for high school president .                                          
0 0 we 're voting for the most powerful leader in the entire world .                                  
1 0 the president , her former primary rival and her vice presidential running mate all in spanish , that speech from tim kaine that was a little history .    
0 0 yesterday as he targets latino voters .                                              
0 0 stay with us , a lot more to talk about .                                      
0 0 al so stay with us on tuesday , do n't miss any of cnn 's coverage day of election day here in america .

0 0 up next , your take on a campaign that is toxic to the end .                              
0 0 including talk about indictment and treat of impeachment even before we know who wins .                              
0 1 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 in the final dates of this presidential campaign , well , listen here .                                
0 1 this sure sounds ominous .                                                  
1 0 the fbi is investigating how hillary clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale in violation of federal law .              
0 0 the investigation is described as a high priority .                                          
0 0 it 's far reaching and has been going on for more than one year .                              
0 0 it was reported that an avalanche of information is coming in .                                    
0 0 the fbi agents say their investigation is likely to yield an indictment .                                  
1 1 wow , right ?                                                    
0 1 game over ?                                                      
0 1 except it 's not true .                                                
0 0 it was also reported pigs fly and cupcakes do n't have calories .                                  
0 0 trump there was borrowing from a `` fox news '' report that cnn and several other networks have checked out and found to be , emphasis on `` not ''
0 0 even fox walk back the story .                                              
0 1 but do n't expect trump would take it back or say sorry .                                  
0 0 that 's part of the campaign were there is plenty -- that there is plenty in the wikileaks documents , in her career history , her service at the state
1 0 trump using i mean just the implications after this election of elements in the fbi being willing to kind of promote this story , and injecting the fbi into the
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 this is kind of an ominous ...                                              
1 0 that 's why this letter was so damaging , because it was just so vague about exactly what they were looking into and whether or not this leads to anything
0 0 maybe it 's very serious .                                                
0 1 maybe donald trump will eventually be right , but maybe he 'll have no bearing whatsoever and ...                        
1 1 but it 's also ...                                                  
1 1 jim comey did n't just fall off the apple cart .                                      
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 he 's been in the time a long time .                                        
0 0 there were some people around him and say oh , he did n't know it 's going to be spun this way .              
0 0 of course , he knew it 's going to be spun this way .                                
1 1 yeah .                                                        
0 1 i mean it 's almost -- it 's the evolution of what we saw at the rnc convention , his nominated convention .              
0 0 where people where chanting , now , lock her up .                                      
0 0 and you go to a trump rally so you obviously hear the same thing , so for trump , even though what he was saying is n't true , it
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 well enough and more fertile than talking about obamacare .                                        
1 0 and so there is an investigation , they 're looking at some e- mails .                              
0 0 nobody has any idea what the e-mails are .                                          
0 0 you 'll hear republicans or conservative websites saying what they 're , they have no idea what they 're talking about , because we do n't know .    
0 0 the fbi says even it 's just starting to review them , but you have some republicans including republicans who have titles like chairman in this town already saying if
1 0 assuming she wins , and the investigation goes forward , and it looks like an indictment is pending , at that point in time under the constitution , the house
0 1 it would go to the senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place .                              
1 0 there 's a couple of `` ifs '' in there ...                                      
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 but why talk about this in a town that is already toxic , in a town that ca n't get this , so why do you say you ask me
1 0 but it remind all of those republican voters , moderate republican voters who were thinking , maybe , they could vote for hillary clinton , it reinforces , again ,
0 0 this cloud over the clintons that we 've had for many years , and ...                              
1 1 you can do it in a slightly less alarming way .                                      
0 0 ca n't you ?                                                    
1 0 can .                                                        
1 0 but , you know , you do n't forget about mike mccaul 's own politics on this .                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 he potentially may run in the senate primary against ted cruz in 2018 , you know , this is of course ...                
1 1 just pro playing .                                                    
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 a mistake maybe our assumption has been for most of the past 20 years , it 's the toxicity is confined to this town .          
0 0 it 's in the political system and the political leaders .                                      
0 0 in fact if you 're looking at polling in this election , 90 percent of clinton voters said they have a highly unfavorable view of trump .      
0 1 90 percent of trump voters ...                                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 you know , in the 1990s ballot , people voted for bill clinton and respected bob dole ...                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 it was in 200o , a lot of people who voted for bush or gore could 've lived with the other one even in a wait , there are a
0 0 this election , it really feels as though these candidates are running to be the president of different countries , with two different electorates that not only do n't like
0 0 the other american .                                                    
1 0 the phase of the campaign where , you know , we should just expect all kinds of fact-free things to be thrilling into ether , you know , remember ...
1 1 why start it now ?                                                  
1 1 but missing weapons of mass destruction , a couple of election cycles ago .                                
0 0 all those things that you ca n't prove , why not just throw them out there before election .                      
1 0 as long as they bring me a calorie-free beer .                                        
0 0 let us just show as we 're about to close here , but let 's just show this .                      
0 1 there 's one bipartisan agreement on this .                                            
0 0 american people say they 're disgusted .                                              
0 0 reston : yeah .                                                    
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 82 percent in the cbs `` new york times '' will say this campaign has made them feel more disgusted .                  
0 0 13 percent say excited .                                                  
0 1 3 percent neither .                                                    
0 0 i mean this is ...                                                  
1 1 yeah , you want to feel disgusted when you go to vote and before .                              
0 0 everyone -- yeah , people want this to be over soon .                                    
1 1 well , it will be over soon , but , please , no matter how disgusted you feel wherever you are on the spectrum vote .        
0 0 vote-voice your frustration that way .                                                
0 0 our reporters share from their notebooks next , including the key role single women voters may play when we count the votes , come tuesday .        
0 0 all right , about to close here on this beautiful day just above the white house .                          
0 0 let 's head across the `` inside politics '' table , ask our reporters to get you out ahead of the big police news .          
0 0 sneak peak of their notebooks .                                                
0 0 maeve reston ?                                                      
1 1 so , one of the things that i am most curious about on tuesday night is what we 're going to see from single women voters .      
0 0 obviously , people thought this was going to be a record year for female turnout .                            
0 0 we do n't know what the fbi announcement has done , so potentially the press turned out among unmarried women .                  
0 0 the clinton 's allies still ; believe that trump is an incredible galvanizing force for single women and they have been , you know , doing all kinds of efforts
1 1 crunch the numbers .                                                    
0 0 manu ?                                                        
1 1 paul ryan is in a bit of hot water with the right wing of his conference .                          
0 0 some were not happy about the way that he 's handled donald trump .                                
0 0 others want some more reforms to the way that the republican leadership has run the republican conference .                        
0 0 he has a key speaker vote coming up after the election assuming the republican keeps the majority , but the challenge for him is that if they do keep the
0 0 so he 's got some lobbying to do in order to win back support .                              
0 0 he says he 's absolutely running for speaker but it could be a little bit of a challenge for him .                  
1 0 a lot of these fights and fissures and fractions in fact the republican party are not going to end on election day .              
1 1 no .                                                        
1 0 this will be going on for a while .                                          
0 0 ron ?                                                        
0 1 brownstein : through the end of october , hillary clinton had spent $ 180 million on television in florida , north carolina and ohio combined .        
0 0 three states that are part of her insurance policy .                                        
0 0 she has spent a combined 17 million on television at that point in colorado , michigan and wisconsin .                      
0 0 three states that are in her inner core of getting 270 electoral college votes .                              
0 0 and we 'll see in a week whether that gamble that they focus so much on the reach states are we 're safe enough and their must states will pay
0 0 tend to your guardian before you go explore may be better advice there , nia ?                            
1 1 a lot of questions about where michelle obama has been over these last days , because she was so effective in being out there and visible in different states .
0 0 she has been all over black radio , really , over these last days .                              
0 0 and that 's going to continue , she 's been on the rickey smiley show , erica campbell , cathy mocha as well as the steve harvey morning show .
0 0 that 's a show that gets 6 million listeners a week , it 's on 60 stations across the country and the message is pretty simple .      
0 1 if you love the obama 's , vote for hillary clinton .                                    
0 0 she 's also been cutting ads or some down ballot candidates as well and you expect to see her out on the stump , she 'll certainly be out with
1 0 monday in pennsylvania .                                                    
1 0 in that mega panel of folks .                                              
1 0 that 's an important event .                                                
0 1 pennsylvania , no early voting .                                                
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 no early voting .                                                    
1 1 exactly .                                                        
1 0 almost as good as an `` inside politics '' panel .                                      
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 almost .                                                        
1 1 all things are relative yeah .                                                
1 0 i 'm going to closing with a question that takes me back in times when i cover the bush white house .                
0 0 it 's a big rally crowd more important to donald trump and his campaign than smart targeting ?                        
0 1 tuesday 's results will tell for sure .                                            
0 0 but last night offers a telling example .                                            
0 0 trump visited reliably republican johnston county and spoke to a big crowd , that 's in north carolina .                      
0 1 but it is n't a big vote setter as the `` washington post '' notes today , mitt romney , got more than 2.3 million votes in north carolina four
0 0 now a friend of mine with a ton of campaign experience makes this observation .                              
0 0 it seems to be he says a violation of the legendary rumsfeld rules .                                
0 0 you know , donald rumsfeld , the defense secretary in the bush administration .                                
0 0 a leader and a staff not appreciating as romney , puts it `` the wrongness of waste and misuse . ''                  
0 0 in this case , waste and misuse of the principal 's time .                                  
0 0 a fair observation ?                                                    
0 1 well , let 's see how north carolina goes tuesday .                                      
0 0 in any event here is a safe bet .                                          
0 0 trump is more than happy to be in conflict with the rumsfeld rule .                                
0 0 we 're about to say goodbye , but we 're not , we 're going to stay with you right here .                
0 1 watch as donald trump , campaigning live in atkinson , new hampshire .                                  
0 1 let 's go .                                                    
1 0 650 , 000 i figured .                                                
0 1 i guess there has to be some surprises .                                          
0 0 see what they find in those 652 .                                            
0 0 it wo n't be pretty .                                                
0 1 hillary clinton lied to congress under oath when she said she turned overall of her work related e-mails and that she did n't sent classified information on her illegal server
0 0 meaning she may now face major problems for perjury .                                        
0 0 how can hillary manage this country when she ca n't even manage her e- mails ?                            
0 1 did you ever see ?                                                  
0 0 hey , folks , let 's forget all of this stuff .                                    
0 0 what a mess .                                                    
0 0 what a mess .                                                    
0 0 and all she had to do follow the rules and assume people are watching or listening .                          
0 0 who cares , right ?                                                  
0 0 what a mess and for what ?                                              
0 0 now we 're going have her running the country for four years ?                                  
0 0 what a -- honestly what a terrible , terrible mess over what ?                                  
0 0 over nothing .                                                      
0 0 over what should 've been nothing .                                              
0 0 all she had to do was follow the rules .                                        
0 1 unbelievable .                                                        
0 1 and now she 's going to run the country .                                        
0 0 she 'll be under investigation for years .                                            
0 0 she 'll be with trials .

0 0 victor , bring us up to speed on the very latest in jacksonville .                                
1 0 the storm surge , john , is the major concern here .                                    
0 0 and we just spoke with the mayor 's office .                                        
0 0 their concern between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. and 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. those will be the really crucial hours over the next 24 hours .          
0 0 and , coincidentally , high tide here comes at 2:20 .                                      
0 0 so you 'll have those two elements clashing together here , high tide and the storm surge as we continue to see the rain and the wind here .  
0 0 now , speaking of the wind , there have now been bridge closures .                                
0 0 over my shoulders you see the main street bridge and that 's still open .                              
0 0 we 're told that this will be shut down when winds hit about 50 miles per hour .                        
0 0 we 're not seeing that .                                                
0 0 the national weather service saying that the gusts are reaching about 37 to 40 miles per hour .                        
0 0 but several bridges across jacksonville have been shut down .                                        
0 0 dames point bridge , intercostal bridge , a bridge from atlantic boulevard .                                  
0 0 those have been shut down .                                                
0 0 we also got information about an evacuation from a hospital one county north , in nassau county .                        
0 0 it 's the baptist beaches hospital there in nassau county .                                      
0 0 those patients moved to another hospital .

1 0 and , victor , is the concern there , you hear it , we just heard from the south carolina governor , the florida governor said the same thing earlier
0 0 so if you 're in jacksonville and that area you think , oh , this is n't so bad , i can ride it out .        
1 0 this is - i mean there is a - unfortunately , a false sense of security here , a false sense of feeling that everything is ok .    
0 1 this is the community that has n't been hit by a major hurricane since 1964 .                            
0 0 that 's the one that hit , dora , that came in from senegal across the atlantic , slammed and then headed to the northeast .        
0 0 now , there has been brushes by over the last several years .                                  
0 0 in 1999 ,                                                      
0 0 floyd took a similar path as matthew , but a little further east .                                
0 0 there was - i was here to cover tropical storm fay back in 2009 that sat over this community and just rained and rained .          
0 0 but it 's been a very long time since they 've seen a storm like this .                          
0 0 although what we saw in the south was not as bad as some expected it would be .                        
0 0 jacksonville is now under the bull's-eye and they 've got to prepare .                                  
0 0 if they did not get out with the 450,000 people that the mayor says listened to that evacuation order , they 're being told to stay where they are because
1 1 victor blackwell in jacksonville .                                                  
0 0 victor , stay safe as it comes your way .                                        
0 0 now let 's get to boris sanchez .                                            
0 0 he 's in daytona beach .                                                
0 0 as victor waits , boris has experienced some of this already .                                    
0 0 boris , i was watching you on live throughout the morning , debris flying through the streets .                        
0 0 as you get a better sense of the scope of the damage , are officials - do they have any great sense yet of how bad and how widespread ?
1 0 it 's simply too soon at this point , john .                                      
0 0 the chief of police , when we spoke to him earlier today , told us things were going relatively well .                  
0 0 i 'm going to get out of the way and give you an idea of what we 're seeing here .                  
0 0 as you mentioned , john , the debris in the streets is extensive .                                
0 0 we 've watched as this roof on the business across the street from us has just come undone .                      
0 0 you can see some of the roofing material in the middle of the street here .                            
0 0 we 've also seen large sheets of scrap metal just get blown through the intersections here .                          
0 0 pieces of palm tree as well if you look over to our left .                                
0 0 you can see some of the palm trees over there in the distance .                                
0 0 it 's gone completely bent over .                                              
0 0 and just as we were getting ready to get on with you , things had seemed to calm down .                    
0 0 you know , we 're now in the southwest portion of the hurricane , which is supposed to be basically the weaker part of the storm .      
0 0 the winds are shifting , though , and we 're still feeling them kind of pounding this way .                      
0 0 what we 're waiting on now is an idea of just how many people lost power here .                        
0 1 the lights were going on and off all morning .                                        
0 0 and this area , it appears that they have gone completely dark .                                  
0 0 the other big concern here is the storm surge .                                        
0 1 as we were watching from our hotel balcony this morning , the water was creeping closer and closer .                      
0 0 there was actually a boardwalk not far from the hotel where we are right now and it was - forgive me if i keep looking to the sides , john
0 0 we were watching this thing .                                                
0 0 i spoke to a man who was here for the last time daytona suffered a                              
0 0 direct hit from a hurricane .                                                
0 0 he told me the whole thing was inundated with water .                                      
0 0 this is a very high boardwalk .                                              
0 0 he told me he would n't be surprise if it happened again .                                  
0 0 we 've had to move around several times because of dangerous winds and rain .                              
0 1 at one point earlier we were standing under an awning at the loop in front of the lobby of the hotel and we heard some loud crashing above us .
0 0 we got out of the way .                                              
0 0 and moments later , at least a 500 to 800-pound window came crashing down and then glass started to fall and a piece of wood fell through the awning literally
0 0 and here 's another huge gust of wind .                                          
0 0 so even as i 'm talking , even as this is supposed to be , you know , the lesser part of the storm , you can see , john
0 0 still a very , very precarious and dangerous situation .                                        
0 0 officials have done everything that they can from days ago asking people to stay off the street .                        
0 0 unfortunately , since we 've been reporting here this morning , we 've seen people walking through the street .                    
0 0 as a matter of fact , this morning , i saw a guy doing doughnuts in an intersection not far from us , doing tricks in this car .  
0 0 fortunately , we were there with the chief of police .                                      
0 0 that guy was later stopped and taken to jail .                                        
0 0 but it just goes to show you , some people just do n't listen and they not only put their own lives at risks , but also the lives of
0 0 the police officers and the men and women that go out there and try to save people 's lives in these dangerous , dangerous conditions , john .    
1 1 nice advice and insights from boris sanchez live in daytona beach .                                    
0 0 and as boris notes , if you 've been smart enough to stay in your house , give it a couple more hours .            
0 0 wait till your local officials to you it 's ok to come outside .                                
0 0 boris , stay safe .                                                  
0 0 we 'll stay in touch with you .                                            
0 0 now let 's get to chad myers in the cnn hurricane center .                                  
0 0 so , chad , a lot of people watching and they say , oh , well yesterday you said this might hit landfall , you said this might be catastrophic
0 0 so if you 're further up , there 's a sense of complacency .                                
0 0 and you can hear all the officials saying , do n't let it happen to you .                          
0 0 this thing is still a monster and it 's coming your way .                                  
1 1 the pressure not go up yet , john , which meaning this storm did n't die .                          
0 0 what happened is that it stayed off shore by about 20 miles .                                  
0 0 here is shore , right here .                                              
0 0 and here 's the path , right here .                                          
0 0 it has been wobbling back and forth depending on which way it decides to go , left or go right .                  
0 0 it has n't been a straight path .                                            
0 0 and i 'll show you that in a second .                                        
0 0 what it is doing right now is staying in the gulf stream .                                  
0 1 that 's the warm water just offshore of florida .                                        
0 1 and so that 's why it 's not dying .                                        
0 0 so what it 's doing is that it 's building water here .                                  
0 1 it 's building storm surge .                                                
0 0 and then you think , well , the coast continues to go that way .                              
0 1 it wo n't ever make landfall .                                              
0 0 the problem is , the coast does n't continue to go that way .                                
0 1 it goes that way .                                                  
0 0 because that 's georgia and south carolina .                                            
0 0 so as this storm continues to move from southeast to northwest , it will eventually get all the way into georgia and south carolina with a significant , i believe
0 0 so let 's get rid of this here for just a second and we will move you to this .                    
0 0 this is jacksonville beach .                                                  
0 0 on a normal spring day , on spring break , my son and i would be right there fishing off that pier that you can hardly see .    
0 0 this should be a beach .                                                
0 0 the beach is completely gone .                                                
0 0 ca n't see it , but i assume there 's even water in the parking lot here , there right along the jacksonville beach .          
0 0 here 's where it 's going from here .                                          
0 0 and this is what the problem is .                                            
0 0 it has n't lost any intensity .                                              
0 0 i know it 's not 140 , but it 's 120 , and the pressure has n't done much .                    
0 0 so the storm is still very , very strong .                                        
0 0 it 's just waiting to hit land .                                            
0 0 it 's waiting to do something .                                              
0 0 so as the storm continues to move to the north , it will move into land at some point .                    
0 0 whether it 's brunswick , whether it 's savannah , or whether it 's charleston , this storm will run into the coast because the coast turns before it will
0 0 and that 's the problem .                                                
0 0 it 's still very strong with all of that bubble of water , and 9 to 11- foot storm surge somewhere .                
0 1 whether it 's shem creek in charleston or whether it 's tybee island or somewhere there across the northern sections , as the arm changes , as the coastline turns
0 0 so it will be a significant storm for someone .                                        
0 0 hopefully florida completely in the clear .                                              
0 0 i 'm not sure jacksonville is yet because of that surge that 's going to go into the st. john 's river .              
0 1 john .                                                        
1 0 chad myers , thanks .                                                  
0 0 we 'll stay in touch throughout the hour and , of course , throughout the day .                          
0 0 and as we mentioned , and chad just noted there , hurricane matthew bearing down on jacksonville , now a major point of concern for the governor , rick scott
0 0 listen here .                                                      
1 0 we are very concerned about storm surge .                                            
0 0 and the worst effects are still likely to come .                                        
0 0 if you remember , the jacksonville area has a low-lying - a lot of low-lying area and especially in nassau county .                
0 0 we 're very focused on jacksonville .                                              
0 0 there 's the potential for significant flooding here .                                          
0 0 and we 're not through this at all .                                          
0 0 you know , there 's no victory lap here .                                        
0 0 the victory lap is - is when this storm leaves our state , and i hope it does n't hit , you know , georgia , south and north carolina
1 0 governor rick scott earlier today .                                                
0 0 again , the focus is n't on the winds , it 's on the water .                            
0 0 the storm surge .                                                    
0 0 let 's talk more about jacksonville with that city 's sheriff , mike williams , who joins us on the phone right now .            
0 1 sheriff , first , thank you for your time on this very busy day .                              
0 1 i know you 're preparing .                                                
0 0 you heard the governor there , you heard chad myers .                                      
0 0 their - yes , the winds - winds are punishing , but because of the river that comes into jacksonville , they 're worried about the storm surge .  
0 0 what are you being told the latest of how much of a storm surge to look for and how far inland ?                
1 1 well , you know , thanks again , john .                                        
0 0 and it depends on the - obviously it depends on the , you know , where we are .                      
0 0 the river 's a significant part of our geography and it goes a long way , you know , through duval county .              
0 0 so in some - in some parts we 'll see , you know , a storm surge of probably six to seven feet and others maybe only three feet .
0 0 but , again , all of that 's significant .                                        
0 0 anything over three feet is a - is a threat to life and we 've been putting that information out since early yesterday .            
0 0 and , you know , so we 're , obviously , taking this very seriously .                            
0 0 and the governor 's right , i mean water 's our big concern .                                
0 0 we are concerned about wind , too , the next couple hours , but - and we 'll - we 'll be dealing with the - the flooding for at
1 1 and you 've got a couple hours before you get the brunt of it .                              
0 0 what 's your biggest concern right now and do you have people in areas that are supposed to be evacuated who are n't listening ?          
1 1 well , you know , we do .                                            
0 0 and i think we 've - yes , we started early yesterday morning encouraging people to evacuate .                        
0 0 and the mayor ordered evacuations of the beaches and some other low-lying areas .                                
0 0 so , you know , we think , based on traffic yesterday , that we had a good number of people take advantage of that .        
0 0 but , at this point , especially this morning , we began to tell people , look , stay where you are .              
0 0 hunker down and ride this storm out .                                            
0 0 so , you know , we - we 're planning for the worst and hoping for the best .                      
0 1 and it looks like that , you know , we 'll be catching the brunt of the storm here in the next couple hour and really through probably the next
0 0 so we 've done a lot to message that to the community and prepare for that , obviously .                      
0 0 and then we 'll , you know , we will , after that , plan for the , you know , the recovery .            
1 0 but if there 's somebody who ignored those orders , you 're advice now is to stay put .                      
0 0 is it too late for them to move or is there still time to get out ?                          
1 1 yes , no , it 's too late to move at this point .                                
0 0 i would n't - i would n't recommend anybody be on the roads at this point .                          
0 0 i would - you know , we have , again , from this morning , been encouraging people just to stay where you are and , you know , hunker
0 0 so , you know , and - we - we 're monitoring calls for service and - and , you know , doing all that we can do , but
0 0 so that 's also a message that we 've been talking about for the last several days .                        
0 0 you know , there will become a point where first responders , it wo n't be safe for them to be on the roads either .        
0 0 so , you know , again , that 's a - that 's a minute-by-minute conversation and evaluation that we 're having .              
0 0 so , at this point , it 's best for everyone to stay in the house , stay where they are .                
0 0 you know , you should be in your safe place by now which - let 's ride it out together .                  
1 0 sheriff , how different is the advice you 're getting , the forecast you 're getting , the track , the damage projections you 're getting from the emergency management
0 0 obviously the track has changed a little bit .                                          
0 0 i 'm wondering , what are they telling you today that 's different from yesterday ?                            
1 1 well , you know , we 've been fortunate enough that we 've got the - a representative from the national weather service here with us , the national hurricane
0 0 so we 're getting great up to date information about the weather .                                  
0 0 and it - you know , we had many reports yesterday that the worst case scenarios kept getting worse and worse and worse .            
0 0 so we got a little bit of a break today with some of the messaging but nothing that changes any of our messaging to the public .      
0 0 so , you know , while it did stay offshore a bit , we 're still taking the hit of a major hurricane .            
0 1 and we 've been , again , putting that information out to our community for a couple days .                      
0 0 so , you know , while , again , while we hope that it will be - you know , the impacts wo n't be as grave as we anticipated
1 0 sheriff , appreciate your time on this very busy day .                                      
0 0 good luck to you and your entire force in the hours ahead .                                  
0 0 and , folks , if you 're in the jacksonville area , listen to your sheriff .                          
0 0 if you 're in a place that should have been evacuated , hunker down , ride it out , keep in touch with local law enforcement .      
0 1 sheriff , again , thanks so much on this day .                                      
0 1 we just heard from president obama as he got an update from the federal emergency management agent and the department of homeland security .            
0 0 next , the head of fema join us live with the latest on the response to hurricane matthew .                      
0 0 continuing our breaking news coverage of hurricane matthew as it makes its way up the florida coast , moving slowly up florida 's east coast , expected to bear down
0 0 daytona beach hit hard overnight , early this morning .                                        
0 0 we 'll soon be able to start to assess the damage .                                    
0 0 as you can see , there 's debris all over the streets there .                                
0 0 some roofs torn off .                                                  
0 0 more than a half million people without power and a state of emergency in effect in the state of florida .                  
0 0 president obama , speaking this morning at the white house , just after a brief from the fema administrator , craig fugate .              
1 0 so pay attention to what your local you are telling you .                                    
0 0 if they tell you to evacuate , you need to get out of there and move to higher ground , because storm surge can move very quickly and people can
1 0 craig fugate joins us now by phone .                                            
0 0 craig , thanks for joining us on this very busy time .                                    
0 0 it 's been interesting throughout the day , i saw you on television a bit earlier .                          
0 0 then i listened to the governor of florida , the governor of north carolina , the president of the united states .                
0 0 in all of their message they seem to be saying , if you 're watching the news and you think this was n't as bad as you thought it was
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
0 1 i think , you know , people he seen some of the earlier reports out of south florida and said , well , this storm 's not that bad ,
0 0 it 's no longer a category four hurricane .                                          
0 0 and we need to really emphasize that this is a - still a very dangerous storm , particularly for north florida , but also we need to be talking about
0 0 the time for action is running out and people need to move to higher ground .                            
1 1 all right , you 're from florida originally and you were the - the state emergency management agency director there .                  
0 0 when you see this storm off the coast and it has n't hit land , so it 's holding a lot of water out there , and it 's coming
0 1 not that - not that you 're taking the winds lightly , but that 's a lot of water .                    
1 0 it 's a lot of water , and when you look at past hurricanes , the biggest killer from hurricanes has always been water .          
0 0 we tend to talk a lot about wind and the power outages , but it is really about the damaging and life-threatening storm surge that we 're going to see
1 0 take me through the nuts and bolts , the logistics , i guess it is , of your emergency response teams .                
0 0 you were prepared if this thing hit land further to the south .                                  
0 0 obviously it 's caused some damage there .                                            
0 0 but now it looks like if there 's a big impact , it 's going to be more to the north .                
0 0 how are you moving things around and where are they going ?                                    
1 1 well , we were already anticipating having to support most of the southern southeast coastal states .                          
0 0 so we 've had staging areas up in fort bragg supporting north carolina , south carolina .                          
0 0 we 've had staging areas in albany , getting ready to support georgia and florida .                            
0 0 we 've moved resources down to orlando .                                            
0 0 so we 've been anticipating all four states getting hit with some degree of impacts .                            
0 0 and as the storm moves up , we 'll move our resources and adjust based upon the track and impacts .                  
1 0 any hiccups , problems ?                                                  
0 1 whether it 's coordination or supplies falling out of place along the way ?                                
1 0 not that i 'm aware of , but it 's a disaster and i 'm sure we 're going to see that .              
0 0 that 's part of the reason why we tend to over respond .                                  
0 0 you do n't have precision in these things and i 'd much rather have stuff that later turns out i did n't need than to be late .    
0 0 so we 've been basing this , and , again , as we were looking at populations of south florida , on very large numbers .        
0 0 so we 'll be adjusting based upon the areas of impact and moving resources , but we 're not turning anything off or turning anything away until we are absolutely
1 0 what is the latest information you have , the latest projection on where it hits land ?                          
1 1 well , you know , that 's kind of the question .                                    
0 0 as it is now , it 's staying right off the florida coast .                                
0 0 it looks like , based on forecast track , closest point of approach , if it does make landfall , will be in south carolina .        
0 0 but as my good friend , former director of the center , max mayfield used to say , do n't focus on that skinny black line .      
0 0 hurricanes are not a point on the map .                                          
0 0 this is an area of impact over a large area .                                      
0 0 storm surge , heavy rains , were - we were talking about , the potential with the weather service about heavy rains in north carolina causing tremendous flash flooding .
0 0 so you really need to be heeding the local officials , and your local weather service offices .                        
0 1 do n't worry too much about landfall .                                            
0 0 this storm is close enough , the impact are going to be pretty dramatic for most of the coastal communities as it goes by .          
1 0 as you were speaking there , we 're showing some pretty high water in the streets of st. augustine , florida , to your point about flooding coming in .
0 0 and , again , the worst of matthew not up to that area quite just yet .                          
0 1 craig , you have access to the highest technical equipment in the land .                                
0 0 you 've got satellite images .                                                
0 0 you 've got planes flying into the eye of the storm .                                    
0 0 but you operate at fema with something called a waffle house index .                                  
0 0 explain that to our viewers .                                                
1 1 yes , we 've - in florida , for a long time , one of the things that we kind of observed was that waffle houses were usually the first
0 0 and so if the waffle house was open , we knew it was n't too bad , keep going .                    
0 0 if it was open with a limited menu , we probably had a lot of power outages and needed to be prepared to support mass care .      
0 0 but if the waffle house was closed , that 's a pretty bad indicator .                              
0 0 and i believe waffle house was closing waffle houses in advance of this storm .                              
0 0 so in florida , that , i think , helped a lot of people                                
0 0 understand that nobody was kidding around .                                              
0 0 this storm was bad .                                                  
0 0 we 've had disney close .                                                
0 0 we 've had college football games cancelled .                                            
0 0 so a lot of people taking steps to get ready .                                      
1 0 all of the science in the world .                                            
0 0 sometimes you 've just got to make it personal to bring it home .                                
0 1 craig fugate , again , thanks for your time on this busy day .                                
0 0 best of luck in the hours ahead .                                            
0 0 we appreciate your joining us to give us the latest .                                      
0 0 this storm now reeling toward - barreling towards jacksonville as it moves up the florida coast and smaller coastal towns also being hit hard .          
0 0 we 're going to talk to the mayor of st. augustine .                                    
0 0 you just saw pictures of water in the streets there .

0 0 now a storm surge hitting that area as we speak .

    what just happened about 12 hours ago ?                                            
    a plane got blown out of the sky                                            
1 1 and hillary clinton gives donald trump and his tweets a failing grade .                                  
1 0 it 's a pattern .                                                  
0 0 it 's a pattern that has gone on now for months .                                    
1 0 plus , the trump unity push accelerates .                                            
0 0 conservative overtures on judges and guns .                                              
1 0 i will not let you down .                                              
0 0 remember that .                                                      
0 0 i will not let you down .                                              
1 0 and clinton makes a big bet , there will be democratic unity , she says , down the road a bit .                
1 0 what brings us together is donald trump .                                            
1 1 but for now , bernie sanders is not in a kumbaya mood .                                  
1 0 we are in until the last ballot is cast .

0 0 i 'm john king .                                                  
0 0 thanks for sharing your sunday morning .                                              
0 0 the wild presidential nominating season entering now its final stretch and here are three big questions .                          
0 0 will voters prefer donald trump 's tough talk or hillary clinton 's experience when weighing the commander-in-chief test that comes with crises like egyptian air flight 804 ?    
1 0 when you run for the united states , the entire world is listening and watching .                            
0 0 and i think if you go through many of his irresponsible , reckless , dangerous comments , it 's not just somebody saying something off the cuff .    
1 0 question two : are fresh overtures to conservatives on judges in the second amendment easing concerns now that a trump-led republican ticket would mean disaster for other gop candidates come
1 0 hillary clinton wants to abolish the second amendment , just remember that .                                  
0 0 we 're not talking about changing it .                                            
0 0 she wants to abolish the second amendment .                                            
0 0 so we 're not going to let that happen .                                        
0 0 i can tell you that right now .                                            
1 0 and question three , it 's a fascinating one this sunday morning .                                  
0 0 is bernie sanders now encouraging a tea party-like revolt in the democratic party ?                                
0 0 escalating his war with the national party chairwoman by endorsing her liberal challenger in a congressional primary .                        
1 0 clearly , i favor her opponent .                                              
0 0 his views are much closer to mine than is wasserman schultz 's .                                  
0 0 and let me also say this , in all due respect to the current chairperson , if elected president , she would not be reappointed to be chair of the
1 0 in all due respect , he says that .                                          
0 1 we 'll get to that one in a minute .                                        
0 0 with us to share their reporting and their insights , julie pace of `` the associated press '' , jonathan martin of `` the new york times '' , matt
0 0 elections , they say , are about choice .                                          
0 0 at their best , about clear and contrasting policy choices .                                      
0 0 well , here 's donald trump with the national rifle association convention .                                  
1 0 the second amendment is on the ballot in november .                                        
0 0 the only way to save our second amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named donald trump .                
0 0 i will protect our second amendment .                                              
0 0 i will protect our country .                                                
1 0 here 's hillary clinton last night at a trayvon martin foundation dinner .                                  
1 0 unlike donald trump , i will not pander to the gun lobby and we will not be silenced and we will not be intimidated , as long as children anywhere
1 0 that 's about as clear a choice as you can get .                                    
0 0 mr. trump sees this as a twofer in his effort to unify a skeptical republican party , gun rights matter to most conservatives .            
0 1 and attacking clinton -- well , that helps , too .                                      
1 0 crooked hillary clinton is the most anti-gun , anti-second amendment candidate ever to run for office .                          
1 0 now , secretary clinton sees it as a way to energize the obama coalition , african-americans in urban areas , women in the suburbs and as part of clear effort
1 0 he 's talking about more guns in our schools .                                        
0 0 he 's talking about more hatred and division in our streets .                                    
0 0 you want to imagine what trump 's america will look like .                                    
0 0 picture more kids at risk of violence bigotry , picture more anger and fear .                              
1 0 right out of the box , elections -- it 's good to have clear choices .                            
0 0 on the guns issues , one of many , pretty clear that hillary clinton waste no time firing back .                    
0 0 this is an issue democrats often ran from in national elections .                                    
0 0 pretty clear she thinks it helps her on the map .                                      
0 0 she wants to win .                                                  
0 0 and it 's pretty clear mr. trump thinks it 's pretty important to him .                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 i mean , first , i think we should it is amazing we 're talking about guns as we turn to a general election .          
0 0 barack obama in both of his campaigns really ran away from this issue , did n't see it as a winning issue for him .          
0 0 clinton looks at this and see this very differently right now .                                    
0 1 she sees this as a way for her to show voters that she 's not just going to be anti-donald trump , that she actually has an issue that she
0 1 i think that 's important for her .                                            
0 0 because she has struggled with her messaging .                                            
0 0 but it 's interesting with trump , i was at the nra convention on friday , and he had a script that he was trying desperately to stick to though
0 0 and when he was introduced by nra leaders as they endorsed him , their entire remarks were about hillary clinton .                  
0 0 the only time they mentioned donald trump was to actually say they were endorsing him .                            
0 0 and you can see the tension in there .                                          
0 0 they want to get behind him because they want to be against hillary clinton , yet at the same time they are somewhat skeptical of where trump is on the
1 1 that 's a great point .                                                
0 0 let 's get to it .                                                
0 0 you have the nra endorsing trump because they so do n't want hillary clinton , and yet this on this and many other issues .          
1 0 they 're endorsing not hillary .                                                
1 0 conservatives are very skeptical because back in the day , donald trump endorsed the assault weapons ban .                        
0 0 now , he can make the case that was a long time ago , during the bill clinton presidency .                    
0 0 but just three years ago , a little more than three years ago , after the newtown shooting , donald trump tweeted out , when president obama went to newton
0 0 jonathan , president obama in that speech called for strict new gun controls .                                
1 0 donald trump has been on the other side of the issue with conservatives on literally every issue of importance to them .                
0 0 that 's not new .                                                  
0 0 look , if you 're conservative and support donald trump you have to basically make this entirely about hillary clinton , and basically , you have to rationalize by saying
0 1 they know that but he 's put on the red jersey , so they 're rallying to his side because he 's not hillary .          
0 1 what 's striking about the gun debate to me is that it does capture how the era of persuasion politics is now over .            
0 0 we 're in an era of mobilization politics .                                          
0 0 hillary clinton is focusing on this issue she wants to mobilize the obama base out to support her .                      
0 0 and that 's one of the issues that really galvanizes them .                                    
1 0 and grade for us the trump effort he put out a list of judges , there was a lot of skepticism earlier in the game .        
0 0 his sister who happens to be pro-choice on abortion rights , she 's a judge , and he said she would be a great supreme court justice .    
0 0 now , he 's pulled that one back , said he could n't do it anyway it would be nepotism .                  
0 0 but he put out a list of judges and conservatives generally said , pretty good .                            
0 0 that 's a pretty good list and you do have the vacancy now .                                
0 0 so , do they -- again , do they trust him ?                                    
1 0 and that 's the big thing .                                              
0 0 you did have people say this is a great start , these are conservative justices , we like these folks , they 're not sort of the run of the
0 0 but then you have people like erick erickson saying how can we trust this guy ?                            
0 0 are these just suggestions , a phrase that donald trump himself has used to describe some of the policies ?                    
1 0 about the muslim ban .                                                  
1 0 about the muslim ban , about walls .                                            
1 0 details of the wall .                                                  
1 0 everything he said .                                                    
1 0 is essentially a suggestion .                                                  
0 0 so there still has to be some persuasion at least among the chattering classes .                              
0 0 but donald trump has already mobilized actual republican voter , those folks are coming around if you look at these polls , if you look at `` the washington post
0 0 it 's still early .                                                  
0 0 so , you know , he 's still got to do some work with the people who get on tv and talk all the time , but the base ,
0 0 it 's going to be about the economy .                                          
0 0 it 's going to be about strength , it will be about mobilizing folks and not about who is the purist conservative .              
1 0 he also said he might add to that list , which makes it like this is not a restricted 11 people .                
0 0 who knows who is going to add ?                                            
0 1 one of the striking things is mitt romney struggled so much with the flip-flop label and donald trump as john was saying has been on every side of every issue
0 1 he just -- i 'm flexible , i 'll change my mind and i think he 's struggling right now to connect with conservatives because of that , because they
1 0 and we 're talking about the issues , conservatives trust some of the issues .                              
0 0 jonathan , you 're part coauthor of the lead story in the sunday paper today , essentially the donors aversion to trump clouds the big fundraising goal .    
0 0 now , donald trump says these things do n't matter to him , that he can unify the party , he does n't need the traditional infrastructure , but in
0 0 but in a close race against any democrat , how much does that matter if donors are saying , i ca n't do this ?          
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 so , we have a story at the paper about his challenge with not just bringing folks .                        
0 0 these are the biggest donors in republican party , the folks over the last three elections who have given the most money to gop causes , millions and millions of
0 0 but some of these folks just say , look , he 's a billionaire , he says .                        
0 0 why does he need my money ?                                              
0 0 so , this is billionaire on billionaire violence we 're talking about .                                  
0 0 martin ; the fact is , is that there is still even nia mentioned this , coalescing among voters among elites , there is still deep concern about trump 's
0 0 here is the math .                                                  
0 0 you got to rise about $ 8 million plus a day between now and election day to hit that part .                  
0 0 if you do n't have those people on your side you 're not going to raise $ 1 billion .                    
1 0 he 's shown hesitance to write his own checks .                                        
0 0 there 's stories leaving open the possibility of repaying everything he 's done in the primaries alone .                        
0 0 and he says no , but technically and legally with their filings , they 've left open the possibility that he could repay himself .          
1 1 there 's also question how liquid his finances are .                                        
0 0 he 's got , you know , maybe $ 300 million to $ 500 million according to some estimates .                    
0 0 so he 'd have to start selling some buildings , taking out mortgages on those in order to pay for himself , but that 's what the donors are saying
0 0 you 're so wealthy .                                                  
0 1 write a check .                                                    
1 0 but there 's also a question about what trump is going to do with his campaign .                          
0 1 part of the reason you need money because you build these huge campaign infrastructures .                              
0 0 you spend money on television ads .                                              
0 0 he 's also shown he 's not necessarily going down that path .                                  
1 0 and he has n't needed it .                                              
0 0 he 's proven you can sort of run on a shoestring budge net a primary and who knows what can happen in a general .          
1 0 we 're about to find out .                                              
0 0 everybody , sit tight .                                                  
0 0 ahead the commander in chief test , how donald trump sees the egyptian air flight 804 crisis as a dividing line .                
0 0 first , though , politicians say the darned things and sometimes they get some help .                            
0 1 `` saturday night live '' looking back at a key moment in the democratic campaign .                            
1 0 remember when i told everyone to stop talking about your damn e-mail ?

1 0 remember the states like wyoming where you beat me by a lot but then i still got most of the delegates !

0 0 there is zero doubt a sudden catastrophic failure caused egyptair flight 804 to plunge from the sky en route cairo from paris .              
0 0 but why it happened remains a mystery .                                            
0 0 egyptian officials say they suspect terrorism but they also stress other possible causes can not be ruled out .                      
0 0 and now , last-minute alerts from the plane about smoke are raising questions about a possible fire or electrical problem .                  
0 0 the search for data recorders and other vital clues continues but donald trump already knows the cause .                        
0 0 he was certain from the moment he heard of the tragedy .                                    
0 0 `` looks like yet another terrorist attack '' , trump said in a tweet thursday morning .                          
0 0 `` when will we get tough , smart and vigilant . ''                                    
1 0 a plane got blown out of the sky , and if anybody thinks it was n't blown out of the sky , you 're 100 percent wrong , folks .
1 0 now , many democrats are saying trump was reckless , that a president ca n't get out ahead of the facts like that .            
0 0 but in an interview on cnn , hillary clinton essentially agreed with mr. trump it was likely , in her view an act of terrorism but she says trump 's
1 0 do you think that donald trump is qualified to be president ?                                    
1 1 no , i do not .                                                
1 0 was that an example of the trump effect ?                                          
0 0 many democrats that they were e-mailing around there he goes again , shooting from the hip , sending out these tweets , a president ca n't do that .  
0 0 we do n't have the facts .                                              
0 0 everybody suspects it 's terrorism .                                                
0 0 but a president ca n't say that ,                                            
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 but trump does say it and hillary clinton instead of saying a president ca n't say that essentially agrees with him .                
1 1 yes , and i think that one of the challenges that clinton has in this campaign is that you 're seeing a bit of a reaction to obama , who
0 0 he would never say something is terrorism without really knowing it 's terrorism , and i think a lot of americans feel like they want a little more of a
0 0 trump obviously takes that to an extreme .                                            
0 0 clinton comes to this and more of the obama mold .                                      
0 0 she has been in politics a long time .                                          
0 0 she says she understands that words matter but she ca n't risk being branded as completely establishment as someone who would just be in a traditional mold of a politician
0 0 so i think you see her in these instances getting further than she herself would want to be because she knows that voters are looking for a little more of
1 0 and one of the things she was trying to do in that interview , make news and say that he was on , but trying to get voters to imagine
0 1 she brought up the example of bin laden .                                          
0 0 she was in that room and ultimately they made a case around bin laden and looked at the evidence and made the case to obama and he made the final
0 0 so she 's trying to discredit him and one of the things if you look at some focus groups , a lot of republicans who were reluctant to back donald
0 1 one of the things they did talk about was they had problems envisioning him in the oval office .                      
0 0 that 's something i think they know they might have something of an opening there with some republicans .                      
1 0 if you look let 's not put stock in polls in late may projecting to november especially when it comes to the horse race , who 's winning ?  
0 0 but when you do look like the candidate characteristics , there 's no doubt clinton and trump have high negatives but the new `` the washington post '' poll even
0 0 you can tell in that interview , that 's the point she was trying to emphasize .                          
0 0 listen to her donald trump wants to be president .                                        
0 0 he has to be more careful about what he says .                                      
1 0 so when you say we 're going to bar all muslims , you are sending a message to the muslim world and also sending a message to the terrorists because
1 0 so , she says , i 'm experienced .                                          
0 0 i know how to be calm in these moments .                                        
0 0 he says you were secretary of state , benghazi happened , in his view she lied to the families , you were secretary of state , look around the world
1 1 well the other thing that was more surprising from her was calling it likely terrorism .                            
0 0 you almost expect that from donald trump at this point for him to wake up and immediately jump to his gut reaction .              
0 0 like you 're saying i think it 's the trump effect , he is more eager to jump on board with something like that , and it gets to i
0 0 and here , hillary clinton was sort of jumping maybe too early given what we found over the past --                    
1 0 it 's a preview of the tension we 'll see over the next six months .                            
0 0 anytime there 's some kind of a crisis or a world event like this , we know what the reaction from trump 's going to be , immediate and it
1 0 and as he makes that case , he says , if you do n't believe me , listen to bernie sanders .                
1 0 bernie sanders said that hillary really is n't , essentially not fit to be president .                            
0 0 she 's not qualified to be president .                                            
0 0 he said unqualified and he said that she suffers from bad judgment , and she does .                          
1 0 so , the cruz/trump romance ended but the trump/bernie bromance i guess is beginning .                              
1 1 yes , and this is what democrats have feared , that donald trump will simply pick up the attacks bernie sanders leveled on clinton throughout the primary and make that
0 0 certainly , foreign policy , i think that one of sanders ' most effective critiques of her was that , yes , you do have the experience but remember the
0 0 you 're going to hear that a lot from donald trump .                                    
1 0 we 'll get to the democrats next .                                            
0 0 but in senator sanders defense , he also says , donald trump over my dead body , when it comes to the president .            
0 0 he still has lot of issues with secretary clinton , but he does go after trump pretty hard .                      
0 0 and we 'll get to that next .                                            
0 0 is bernie sanders now encouraging a tea-party style revolt in the democratic party ?                                
0 0 and while you think about that , please take our inside politics quiz this morning .

0 0 fascinating story developing this morning .                                                
0 0 bernie sanders taking his war with the democratic establishment to a new level , and it could significantly complicate efforts to unify the party after it 's already contentious presidential
0 0 in an interview you will see in full here at the top of the hour on `` state of the union with jake tapper '' , listen here , sanders
1 0 clearly , i favor her opponent .                                              
0 0 his views are much closer to mine than as wassermann schultz 's .                                  
0 0 and let me also say this , in all due respect to the current chairperson , if elected president , she would not be reappointed to be chair of the
1 1 ouch .                                                        
0 0 now , that 's not just picking a fight with congresswoman wasserman schultz , whom the sanders campaign accuses of favoring hillary clinton , she 's president obama 's handpicked
0 0 not only , sanders saying that encourages revolt against establishment figures just when democrats hope the primary ease and the party focuses on donald trump .        
0 1 what is this about ?                                                  
0 0 we 've seen what the tea party intentions have done in the republican party in recent years .                        
0 0 some people say they 're horrible .                                              
0 0 other people say , look , we 've got a house majority .                                  
0 0 but is bernie sanders sending a signal to his supporters -- go find other cases , find the establishment figures who are with clinton , find super delegates maybe from
1 1 yes , and this is the worst nightmare right now .                                      
0 0 people keep talking about 2008 how that was brutal .                                        
0 0 this is much more divisive right now .                                            
0 0 hillary clinton at the end of that really rallied behind barack obama .                                  
0 0 she had something to gain at end of it which was a secretary of state position .                          
0 0 bernie sanders is not in that same boat .                                          
0 0 he 's an independent who caucused with democrats and not necessarily looking toward his $ , party future in the democratic party .              
0 0 there 's a lot of friction that may not be --                                      
1 1 hillary was a party person .                                                
1 0 that 's so key with hillary clinton she wanted a democrat clearly in the white house , she wanted democrats .                  
1 0 but sanders does say repeatedly he does n't want trump .                                      
1 0 but that 's different than saying he wants the democratic party as it currently exists in power .                        
1 0 i reached out to somebody in vermont who 's known bernie sanders for 40 years and been a political ally of his and watched his career .      
0 0 he said that bernie sanders sees himself as an indispensable historic figure and that he --                            
1 1 wow .                                                        
1 1 he feels like sanders feels like it 's his destiny to lead the democratic party and this is his last chance to do so .          
0 1 i mean , when you put into in those sort of grand terms , i think looks a little different .                  
0 0 king : let 's get to that then .                                          
0 0 if that 's his mind-set and you 're                                            
0 0 hillary clinton and just told cnn that interview showed you earlier with chris cuomo , that you think he 'll come around , you think eventually it will be fine
0 1 right now , she said i understand this , i went through it in 2008 .                            
0 0 but listen to senator sanders here , he is on `` state of the union '' at the top of the hour .              
0 0 he also did another sunday show interview where he continues to make the case that democrats still have time he says to pick him over clinton .      
1 0 we needed a campaign , an election coming up which does not have two candidates who are really very , very strongly disliked .            
0 0 i do n't want to see the american people voting for the lesser of two evils .                          
0 1 i want the american people to be voting for a vision of economic justice , of social justice , of environmental justice , of racial justice .      
1 0 now , he says he 's in the campaign to make our democracy better and he has issues about super delegates , about campaign finance and the like .  
0 0 but let 's just look at the tale of the tape in the democratic race so far .                        
0 0 she has 1775 pledged delegates , he has 1485 .                                        
0 0 she has 522 super delegates , he has 42 .                                        
0 0 she 's won 27 contests , he 's won 21 .                                      
0 0 so by lower case `` d '' democracy she 's winning .                                    
1 0 she is winning .                                                    
0 0 important for us to all say that even as we watch emboldened bernie sanders there obviously fulfil her urged now .                  
0 0 it 's important to note that if you look at our polling in 2008 versus now , more democrats back in 2008 who were supporting hillary clinton so that they
0 0 so , i think these wounds are healable .                                          
0 0 the difference is though is that some of the bernie folks i think are much more radicalized than clinton supporters were in '08 and i think it could be tough
0 0 the clinton strategy is not complicated .                                              
0 0 it 's two words , it 's donald trump .                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 you hold that up and you say , look , you do n't love hillary , you are for bernie , but this is a national crisis that we 're
0 0 i think that 's going to be what they say .                                      
1 0 if you listen to the full interview with chris cuomo there on cnn the other day , good cop/bad cop .                  
0 1 she was very clear i 've been there and i understand the emotions of the supporters .                          
0 0 i understand the -- it 's hard .                                            
0 0 and she said i take senator sanders at his word when he says , you know , over my dead body donald trump .            
0 0 but she also said something that if you 're a sanders supporter you 're not going to like and that would be this .            
1 0 i will be the nominee for my party , chris .                                      
0 0 that is already done in effect .                                              
0 0 there is no way that i wo n't be .                                        
1 0 they do n't want to give bernie anything .                                          
1 0 the sense of inevitability , the sense that we do n't have to let the process completely play itself out .                  
0 0 and one thing that someone is reminding me that 's very interesting about 2008 , hillary played a very active role getting these reluctant supporters on board , they were
0 0 hillary supporters said , `` hillary sent me '' when they would go to obama rallies away with saying that i 'm still with her but i 'm going to
0 0 bernie if he 's not going to be the nominee and he 's going to want to stop donald trump he actively needs to play a role .    
1 0 but to understand , if you 're senator sanders the last thing you want to say now is that the math is inevitable because if you ca n't be the
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 it 's a very slight chance but i still have a chance and he does .                            
0 0 but his other goal is the more delegates he has at the convention the more influence he has at the platform .                
0 0 and so , if you say now it 's over , well then , how do you expect to win new jersey ?              
0 0 how do you expect to win california ?                                            
1 0 and they 're looking at , you know , this platform committee , the credentialing committee , the rules committee , these three big committees and figuring out if they
0 0 i think for democrats , the real worry is that -- is sanders fueling this idea of it is n't win , hillary clinton gets the nomination , it a
1 1 you 've been reading my twitter feed .                                            
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 so , that problem i think the democrats --                                          
1 1 the past week was interesting , we saw a number of members mostly in the united states senate come out and say it 's time for bernie to dial it
0 0 not drop out .                                                    
0 0 they do n't say drop out .                                              
0 0 they say it 's every right to stay into the end .                                    
0 0 but they want him to dial back the rhetoric .                                        
0 0 now , i just want to note for the record these senators also happen to support hillary clinton .                      
0 0 so forgive me there 's a little bit of , you know , mixed message here .                          
0 1 and to those who say that bernie is over the top i just want to remind people we 've all made a point about 2008 .        
0 0 hillary clinton at this exact point in 2008 when it was pretty clear president obama was going to win in the delegate race , pretty clear , super delegates were
1 0 this is nowhere near over .                                                
0 0 none of us is going to have the number of delegates were going to need to get to the nomination .                  
0 0 there is this frantic effort to push her out because she 's winning the general election today , and he 's not .              
0 0 i 've never seen anything like it .                                            
0 0 i 've never seen a candidate treated so disrespectfully just for running .                                  
1 0 look at the electoral map .                                                
0 1 it is clear , i am the stronger candidate against john mccain .                                  
1 0 wow .                                                        
0 0 been there , done that ?                                                
1 0 eerily familiar .                                                      
0 1 the same case too .                                                  
1 0 the same argument .                                                    
1 0 i can beat him in the fall and my opponent is going to lose .                              
1 0 exactly the same argument .                                                  
1 0 i mean , she did in the end have more voters , it was a little closer in terms of the pledged delegates as well .        
0 0 but yes , same argument .                                                
0 1 apparently debbie wasserman schultz was making the exact same argument back then for hillary clinton .                            
1 0 but again , you knew that what like hillary did after that is , you know , is the key and what we think bernie may have trouble doing over
1 0 `` a '' what does he want ?                                            
0 0 does he want -- what does he want ?                                          
0 0 i mean , that 's going to be the big question , if he 's not the nominee , what does he want , does he want an independent movement
0 0 does he want to stay outside the process or does he want to come into the fold and hillary clinton 's democratic party and be a force and compete maybe
1 0 pledges on personnel , that is the test , will she promise to him as he 's not going to appoint the ruben summers type to the treasury in her
0 1 can he extract real hard and fast pledges to him on personnel ?                                  
1 0 bernie sanders signature on the money .                                              
0 1 all right , everybody sit tight .                                              
0 0 little more to go .                                                  
0 0 early spending by a pro-clinton super pacs speaks volumes about where the november election is likely to be one or lost .                
0 0 that 's electoral votes , next .                                              
0 0 you know that old saying , all of the money .                                      
0 0 well , super pac supporting hillary clinton made its first major ad by this week .                            
0 0 and it tells you a lot by how democrats view the fall battleground map .                              
0 0 priorities usa is the group they 're spending in virginia .                                      
0 0 in ohio , in florida , and in nevada , notice anything about those states ?                            
0 1 all blue for president obama , all blue for president obama twice .                                  
0 0 and so , what is the calculation here ?                                          
0 0 if you 're the democrats you want to keep donald trump from turning this , this , and this , because if he did , just turn those four donald
0 0 but this pro-clinton super pac thinks defending the states is part of defending the obama coalition .                          
0 0 the focus of these new ads women using donald trump 's own words .                                
1 0 you know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes , blood coming out of her , wherever .                
0 0 does she have a good body ?                                              
0 0 no .                                                        
0 1 does she have a fat ass ?                                              
0 0 absolutely .                                                        
0 0 a person who is flat chested is very hard to be a ten .                                
0 0 and you can tell them to go themselves .                                          
1 0 does donald trump really speak for you ?                                            
1 0 that ad go bleep themselves every fact checker has taken it grossly out of contest .                            
0 0 so , that -- the priorities usa and the best -- is they have n't changed the ad yet , that 's taken grossly out of context but to the
0 0 if we can defend the obama coalition , we can win                                      
1 1 good luck .                                                      
0 0 i mean , one of the problems is that trump if you look at some of these polls it 's early , yada , yada , yada but he 's
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so it sort of balances out the usual gender advantage that democrats have had for decades now .                        
0 0 i think one of the things about that ad is , it is about women but it 's also about sort of temperament , the tag line does he speaks
0 0 i think you know , so i think it has two purposes , one of which about women .                      
0 0 the other about temperament .                                                  
1 0 spending this early , number one , they 've learned a lesson .                                  
0 0 seventeen republicans stood around thinking donald trump was a joke , he is going to implode and those 17 republicans are now watching .            
0 0 the other 16 republicans are now watching donald trump prepare for his convention .                                
0 0 but the other part is , you can also -- you can poll then you run these ads and you poll again and you 're testing your messages in may
0 0 so , if it does n't , you move on to something else .                                
1 0 and it 's hugely important for hillary clinton to be able to have this super pac doing this because she 's so tied up still in trying to wrap up
0 0 but to me his point , i said a lot of the last two or three weeks talking to women , suburban white women in states like virginia , also
0 0 they worry about him across a range of issues .                                        
0 0 and if you think about this election in terms of margins , barack obama won 41 percent of white women .                  
0 0 even though he won women overall .                                              
0 0 if clinton can hold obama 's margins with minorities and pick off just a couple more percentage points among white women that makes it very difficult for him to win
1 1 and so , look , we talked about guns at the top of the show , we talked about commander-in-chief test at the top of the show , they have
0 0 listen to ivanka trump here .                                                
1 0 i 'm not in every interaction my father has but he 's not a groper , it 's not who he is , and i 've known my father obviously
0 0 he was promoting women in development in construction at a time when it was unheard of .                          
0 0 there was no trend towards equality in the real estate and construction industry back in the 1980s , and he was doing it , because he believes ultimately in merit
1 0 anyone recall we had obviously hillary clinton had to come to bill clinton 's defense in 1992 when there were personal character questions about him .        
0 0 i do n't remember a candidate 's child going on television to do something like that .                          
1 0 and saying my father is not a groper .                                          
0 0 sort of striking the point at which his campaign is right now .                                  
0 0 but to your point earlier , you know , none of the candidates in the republican primary really went after trump in a focused way .        
0 0 i think one other thing as you may see from the clinton campaign is his business record which did n't come under much scrutiny in the republican campaign .  
0 0 marco rubio tried it for a while on the conman argument and that seemed to be successful before he went into his , the size of his hands and things
1 0 and this is part of the challenge that the clinton folks have , i use the metaphor of lucy and ethel in the `` chocolate factory , '' where the
0 0 how do you eat them all ?                                              
0 0 and right , it 's his comments about women , or minorities , or the business litany or cnn just this week had a report about , of the fact
0 0 what do you do ?                                                  
0 0 what do you target ?                                                  
0 0 if you focus on everything you focus on nothing .                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 and that 's part of the challenge .                                            
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 so , you have that from the clinton side .                                        
0 0 what do you focus on ?                                                
0 1 and for those of you too young to understand , lucy and ethel after the show , not now , after the show is over , go on youtube or
0 0 mr. martin has a point there .                                              
0 0 but now he has his own list .                                            
0 0 he just said at another network that he 's going to go after aggressively her e-mail .                          
0 0 he has made clear that he thinks bill clinton and bill clinton 's character is fair game in this campaign .                  
0 0 so , both of them at your point have a list .                                    
0 0 is it just going to be throwing things at the wall or is this the spring and then they will refine it ?              
1 1 i think if they 're going to run a smart campaign you will start to refine that your message particularly on the democratic side but i do think for hillary
0 0 that is hugely important .                                                  
0 0 she 's struggled for months .                                                
1 0 and that 's where the democrats are really worried i think and republicans see trump as somebody who can morph into something else and hillary clinton really struggles with that
0 0 they 're hard to change .                                                
1 0 trump is strength and change .                                                
0 0 what is hillary clinton ?                                                  
1 0 what is hillary clinton ?                                                  
0 0 and that 's what they have to figure out .                                        
0 0 they also have to figure out who is doing the attacking .                                    
0 0 right ?                                                        
0 0 are they going to sort of outsource a lot of the negative stuff to super pac so she does n't get so much blowback and she takes the sort of
1 1 unless trump 's numbers among women and non-whites improve , it 's going to be very hard from the -- very hard , very had .        
1 0 all right , everybody .

1 1 so , we know that president obama is eager to get out on the campaign trail but democrats are also itching for another obama to get out there , and
0 0 she 's been traditionally a reluctant campaigner but she 's quite an effective one particularly with african-americans and young women , another group that has n't really rallied around hillary
0 0 democrats were organizing the convention in july or eyeing a big splashy appearance for her in primetime and you 're starting to see some interest in having michelle obama hit
0 0 so maybe after this campaign she can finally go and be done with campaigning like she said she wants to be .                
1 0 she says or we 'll see if she gets the bug .                                    
0 0 you never know .                                                    
0 0 jonathan ?                                                        
1 1 well , hillary clinton has never dealt with a candidate like donald trump , few have , and it 's starting to show .            
0 0 i think you are going to see more democrats -- to toughen and sharpen her message against donald trump .                    
0 0 there was a reaction among some people last week in the democratic politics that when she said that trump was n't qualified to be president .        
0 0 that was supposed to be tough and they 're saying , no , it has to be more than that .                  
0 0 you ca n't just say he 's not qualified .                                        
0 0 you have to go much more aggressive against him .                                        
0 0 this is unconventional warfare and you ca n't line up traditional infantry and artillery fighting a guerrilla war .                      
1 0 and the early polls and precisely early polls , that 's one of the reasons democrats are a little bit nervous .                
1 1 exactly .                                                        
1 0 matt ?                                                        
1 1 two key political metrics to look at , first is ad spending .                                  
0 0 the rnc is just announced about $ 150 million on a digital ad buy trying to sort of go with hispanics and women , two demographics they need and donald
0 0 but if the primary taught us anything is that the political ads did n't really impact it .                        
0 0 otherwise we 'd be talking about jeb bus right now or not .                                  
0 0 the other thing is hillary clinton has about ten times more staffers than donald trump does right now .                      
0 0 again , in the primary , that did n't matter for trump .                                  
0 0 so , i think the key thing to watch going forward is whether as he shifts from the primary to the general , are these , these like sort of
0 0 can donald trump still win with sort of -- going up against hillary clinton 's aircraft carrier .                        
1 0 new rules .                                                      
0 0 new rules .                                                      
0 0 nia ?                                                        
0 1 henderson : ben carson who in some ways has been very unpredictable                                    
0 0 surrogate for donald trump and some people say , very unhelpful as well , he was on the vp committee , then he was off , then he was on
0 0 he floated some names for possible vp short lists that the donald trump campaign had to walk back .                      
0 0 not that seems like he 's found out sort of his natural fit .                                
0 0 he is going to be reaching out to evangelical leaders for donald trump with the eventual hope of not only they come on board but a meeting will happen in
0 0 people like gary bauer , people like tony perkins , people like vander plaats in iowa .                          
0 0 i reached out to carson 's people to say , what is his pitch to leaders ?                          
0 0 and they said , listen , the simple pitch is it 's trump versus hillary but also he turned to the bible and they said , sometimes god uses men
0 0 still a message .                                                    
0 1 still a message .                                                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 still kind of a mixed message , right ?                                          
0 0 so there you have it .                                                
1 0 as always ben carson 's interesting communication strategy .                                          
0 0 we 'll keep an eye on that one .                                          
0 0 it is very early but leading gop strategists are encouraged by new research that they say shows the automatic trump drag they expected perhaps in races critical to the fight
0 0 after reviewing this polling and other research results , the chamber of commerce announced this past week it 's launching major ad buys in ohio , new hampshire , pennsylvania
0 0 cnn 's also told , ad time was purchased in arizona and nevada .                                
0 0 five of those six senate races features republican incumbent viewed as vulnerable .                                  
0 0 now , those spending to protect the republican senate majority know the democrats plan to tie the gop candidates to controversial trump positions .            
0 0 but they 're encouraged by this new research which shows no automatic immediate trump drag .                            
0 0 now , these gop forces view that the period from now until the republican convention in july is critical to defining these races and they say they 're prepared to
0 0 that 's it for inside politics .                                              
0 0 again , thanks for sharing your sunday morning .

1 1 hello to you , candy .                                                
0 1 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 this time last year , president bush was in full campaign mode running as a wartime president and also fending off charges of a sluggish economy .      
0 0 well , now , even though these latest job numbers showing that there is good news on the economic front , there are concerns about how the president is handling
0 0 specifically , a new associated press/ipsos poll is out that shows just 38 percent of americans approve of the president 's approach ; 59 percent say they disapprove .  
0 0 of course , the survey was taken in recent days during an especially bloody week , as you mentioned , for u.s. forces who are in iraq .    
0 0 since sunday , more than two dozen american troops have been killed there .                                
0 0 and against that backdrop , president bush , during a joint appearance with the leader of colombia yesterday , reiterated that the united states would stay the course in iraq
0 0 and he also pointed to recent comments by osama bin laden 's deputy , ayman al-zawahiri , as evidence that iraq is part of the war on terror .  
0 1 now , on that question of the war on terror , which was combined with foreign policy in that associated press poll , 47 percent of americans said they approve
0 0 meantime , taking a look at the president 's overall approval rating , which continues to hover below 50 percent , this poll showing the president at 42 percent .
0 0 now , mr. bush himself , of course , says he does not pay much attention to polls .                      
0 0 but , of course , that news on iraq and his poll numbers on iraq , something that people are watching very closely to see what effect , if any
0 1 now , as for iraq , the bush administration continues to insist that progress is being made on a number of fronts , saying that iraqis are moving ahead in
0 0 but those images out of iraq , as well as the images here stateside of mourning , certainly seeming to overshadow the administration 's message , as evidenced by these
1 0 cnn 's elaine quijano with the president .                                            
0 1 thanks , elaine .                                                    
0 0 let 's talk more about iraq and the political ramifications with senator bill nelson , democrat of florida , a member of the armed services committee .      
0 0 senator nelson , pretty bluntly , 38 percent approval of the way the president is conducting the war in iraq .                  
0 0 can you sustain a war with those kind of numbers ?                                      
1 0 it 's tough , candy , but we are in a heck of a mess .                            
0 0 we do n't have any alternative but to make sure that we stabilize that country .                            
0 0 you can argue all day long -- and there is plenty of argument -- about whether or not we should have gone in there in the first place .  
0 0 you can argue all day long about the faulty intelligence that we had , and i was a recipient of some of that faulty intelligence .        
0 0 but now that we 're there , the alternative is to turn that country over to the terrorists , to al qaeda .              
0 0 and if they were running that country , sitting on top of all that oil , and then putting pressure on next door neighbor saudi arabia , and if the
0 0 if suddenly the radical elements are in control of a major part of the world 's oil supply , that would bring us to a jolting stop .    
1 0 senator , you voted for the resolution of the war on iraq , as i recall .                          
0 0 correct me if i 'm wrong .                                              
0 1 are you sorry ?                                                    
1 0 candy , not at the time , because , at the time , we were given information that , in fact , there were weapons of mass destruction .  
0 1 this senator was told that saddam had a plan to put drones on ships with biological warfare and drop them off onto east coast u.s. cities .      
0 0 did i think that there was an imminent threat as a result of that information ?                            
0 1 you bet i did .                                                  
0 0 and also those votes that came were also perceived of whether or not we were voting to support our troops .                  
0 0 now it 's a different situation .                                              
0 0 and yet , i think , as i said at the outset , i think we 're in a real fix .                
1 0 so , you know , in some ways , because we started a war that you now appear to believe probably should not have been started , knowing what you
1 0 well , we have to stabilize the country , stabilize them politically , security-wise .                              
0 0 and then they will stabilize politically and economically , if they have a chance .                              
0 0 and i think they do have a chance .                                          
0 0 but it 's not just us doing it alone .                                        
0 0 that 's one of the great faults that i find , and i think is reflected in some of those low numbers for the president , that we have not
0 1 we 've made this our war , when , in fact , when we went into afghanistan , when we went into the first gulf war , we had a
0 0 that 's not the case now .                                              
1 1 senator , i have under about 30 seconds , so i want to give one of those horrible questions .                    
0 0 on a scale of one to 10 , when you look ahead to your reelection bid next year , how high do you think this war in iraq will play
1 0 i think it will be in the top five .                                        
0 0 i do n't think it will be the deciding factor in my particular race .                              
0 0 but i think , clearly , the mood of the country politically is going to be determined about in large part how they feel about iraq .      
1 0 senator bill nelson of florida , as always , we appreciate it .                                  
1 1 thanks , candy .                                                    
1 0 in britain , tony blair says the rules of the game are changing after the terror attacks in london .                    
0 0 coming up , we 'll get blair 's `` get tough '' approach .                                
0 0 and will it enhance his newfound public support or will it threaten it ?                                
0 0 also ahead , iraq and the fight for control of congress .                                    
0 0 will the conflict now make a difference at the polls next year ?                                  
0 0 and the would-be presidential candidates in 2008 may be trying to fly under the radar , but we 've got them in our sights .          
0 0 this is inside politics .                                                  
0 0 british prime minister tony blair today proposed new laws to make it easier for his government to deport foreigners who preach hatred and to bar entry to radical clerics .
0 0 mr. blair said his proposals are not designed to target muslims , only those he described as the `` fringe elements '' that do not truly represent islam .  
0 0 extremist web sites , bookstores and mosques will also be targeted under the new laws .                            
0 0 the prime minister told reporters the country 's earlier guidelines for containing extremists in britain no longer apply .                      
1 0 if someone is a foreign national coming to preach in this country , they are not going to be preaching this kind of extremism .          
0 1 and if they do , they 've just got to understand they 're not going to come in .                      
0 0 and what i 'm trying to do here is -- and this will be followed up with the action in the next few weeks , as i think you will
1 0 a short while ago , i discussed tony blair 's proposals with cnn 's european political editor , robin oakley .                  
0 0 i started by asking robin that , given the signs the event that the recent london bombings have increased political support for blair , how likely is it that today
1 1 the danger in his new proposals is , firstly , that he 's giving only a month 's period of consultation on some of the controversial measures .    
0 0 and the conservative leader , or potential conservative leader , is saying that that is not long enough .                      
0 0 and the liberal democrat leader , charles kennedy , is saying these measures go too far in terms of compromising britain 's civil liberties .          
0 0 and there is a danger , perhaps , that the liberal democrats will start to withdraw some of their support , candy .              
1 0 one of the points the prime minister has made since the bombings is , this will not change our way of life here in britain .        
0 0 with these new proposals , does that still hold true ?                                      
1 0 i do n't think it does .                                              
0 0 the politicians keep insisting that the british are a tolerant people and that they 're not going to let their way of life , their liberal values , their openness
0 0 but quite clearly , this is having an effect on the law .                                  
0 0 tony blair is talking about a changed climate of opinion .                                      
0 0 he 's saying how difficult it was before the last election to get through some anti- terrorist measures .                      
0 0 he 's saying now the british people , although they retain their tolerance , are angry , and that the government has got to react to that .    
0 1 so we 're having , for example , lists drawn up of suspect web sites , bookshops , organizations .                    
0 0 and association with any of those is going to be sufficient to make somebody liable for deportation .                        
0 1 well , people who are the traditional defenders of civil liberties in britain , i think , are going to find that going too far , candy .    
1 1 and is there a sense that britain has been perhaps too soft in its rules that allow people to come into the country ?            
1 1 i think what the government is doing now is virtually an acknowledgement of that .                              
0 0 a lot of people have been saying that london had become london-istan , because it was home to so many radical preachers of hate .          
0 0 and people were contrasting the british laid-back style with that in france , for example , where , with their determined secularism , they banned the wearing of muslim headscarves
0 0 now , tony blair is starting to say , yes , ok , we respect people 's different culture and religion , but they 've got to become part of
0 0 that , i think , is an acknowledgement that perhaps not enough has been done to get integration in the past .                
1 0 and a final question on the timing of this .                                        
0 0 we had heard some of these proposals before from some of your undersecretaries for the prime minister .                        
0 0 what 's new here ?                                                  
0 0 what about the timing of this ?                                              
1 0 the timing of this has a lot to do with the fact that tony blair is about to go on holiday .                
0 0 there had been criticism of the home secretary , the inland security minister , who was about to go on holiday before last big meeting with the police and other
0 0 so i think he 's wanted to show that he was engaged in these efforts right up to the last minute .                
0 0 there 's a bit of political showmanship about this , because nothing will really happen until parliament is back in the autumn .              
1 0 back to u.s. politics after a quick break .                                          
0 0 some democrats say the situation in iraq could have a political price for republicans .                              
0 0 we 'll talk about the big races for the house and senate in 2006 when we return .                        
0 0 you are looking at a live picture out of the san diego north island naval base where they have finished loading up two rescue vehicles known as super scorpios .
0 0 this plane , air force c-5 , will soon depart and head for the southern tip of the kamchatka peninsula .                  
0 0 there , about 625 feet down , are some soviet people aboard a sub .                              
0 0 they are stranded down there .                                                
0 0 the u.s. sending help , trying to rescue them .                                        
0 0 we have been told that perhaps they have air enough until monday .                                  
0 0 we have also been told they only have 24 hours left .                                    
0 0 in any case , a very urgent mission .                                          
0 0 the u.s. on its way to see what it can do to help those russians stuck in the sub right off the kamchatka peninsula .          
0 0 back to inside politics .                                                  
0 0 the fight for iraq is just one of the factors that could influence next year 's congressional elections .                      
0 0 with me now to talk about 2006 are two of our favorite analysts , stu rothenberg of the `` rothenberg political report '' , and amy walter of the ``
0 0 we have this special election in ohio .                                            
0 0 we have the first iraq veteran to run .                                          
0 0 he loses , but not by much .                                            
0 0 so it 's one of things where you lose , it 's a victory .                              
0 0 is it that iraq was so overwhelming , or are there other things at play ?                            
1 0 i think there are a lot of other things more important , in terms of the republican candidate and the ineptness of her campaign , the high quality democratic candidate
0 0 bob taft , the governor , a mess .                                          
1 0 so what do we take from it for -- so what 's the lesson learned here , if any ?                    
1 0 i think what the democratic candidate was able to do so well is he was able to balance being a patriot .                
0 0 and all his ads he ran , he did not run as an anti-war candidate .                            
0 0 he ran with pictures of bush in his ads ; he ran as a marine .                            
0 0 and yet , at the same time , he was able to balance here , also , criticism of the war that helped him raise so much money off the
0 0 these liberal bloggers say they raised over $ 500,000 for him .                                    
0 0 so i think , for frustrated democrats , many of whom who thought the democrats in 2004 did not effectively take advantage of the frustration americans have about the war
0 0 if candidates can figure out how to keep that balance , there is some money out there for them .                    
1 1 and , candy , if you talk to democratic strategists , democratic operatives , they do n't talk about iraq as being decisive .            
0 0 they want to talk about ethics , because they think the ethics message has a broad national appeal , certainly a special appeal in ohio , but a broad national
1 0 and certainly , on that score , we have some new poll numbers recently showing that , do you think the president is honest ? , he has fallen in
0 0 how big of trouble are the republicans in at this point ?                                    
1 1 well , remember , for so many of these republicans in congress , it 's been a long time since they 've had to run in a bad political environment
0 0 you go back to 2002 , obviously had a president with very high approval ratings .                            
0 0 congress still had high approval ratings .                                              
0 0 2004 , still , the president was ok .                                          
0 0 now this safety net that republican candidates have really counted on , especially the president 's handling of the war , terrorism , his ability to really play off john
0 0 and so these candidates are really now kind of on a tightrope without that net .                            
0 1 i think you 're going to start to see many more republicans starting to distance themselves from the president and doing that through their campaign advertising , we have n't
1 1 the way i put it is , conditions are ripe for a democratic wave .                              
0 1 if i was the weatherman , we would talk about atmospherics and barometric pressure .                              
0 0 conditions are appropriate for that -- bad job approval numbers for the president , more people , many more people , majority of the people believe the country is headed
0 0 however , once we focus on individual races , that changes things .                                  
0 1 and i did note a democracy corps poll just out within the last day or two .                          
0 0 they asked a thermometer , feelings about the parties , 100 to 0 ; 100 , i have a very favorable feeling toward the republicans and the democrats , zero
0 0 and the parties were about even , almost identical ratings .                                      
0 0 so while i think the republicans are at risk , i do n't think they 've , at this point , been dramatically harmed .          
1 0 i mean , i was going to ask -- there 's gaining ground and then there 's overtaking the republicans for ...                
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 0 and right now , we 're talking about the possibility of gaining ground , as far as you can see .                  
1 0 and democrats , especially , when it comes to the house , when you have , you know , potentially a bigger universe to go and try to expand into
0 0 and i think the ohio race is one example where they 're going to try to expand the playing field , because today we -- both of us can only
0 0 democrats need 15 to be able to take control of congress .                                    
0 0 so they need to be able to expand the field by trying to recruit more candidates , try to take advantage of some of these atmospherics in places where it
0 0 ohio is a great example .                                                
0 0 but you 're right .                                                  
0 0 fundamentally , if voters think , `` i think the entire system is broken , '' then they 're not necessarily going to award one candidate over the other .
0 0 i think what we 're looking at feels very similar to the early '90s when there was a very strong anti-incumbent message , that both parties suffered .    
0 0 but clearly voters know which party 's in charge .                                        
0 0 and i think running as an outsider in this environment would be a very smart move .                          
1 0 and if you 're at the democratic senate campaign committee , the congressional campaign committee , you can point to the paul hackett race , but you could also point
0 0 you go out to donors and say , we 've got a terrific opportunity .                              
0 1 look .                                                        
0 0 give to us .                                                    
0 0 and you go out and recruit the candidates .

0 0 he 's a well-connected longtime democratic state senator from new hampshire .                                    
0 0 next question , what 's john edwards doing here , on his third new hampshire visit since the last election ?                  
0 0 : are you running for president ?                                              
1 0 no .                                                        
0 0 my campaign is to do something about poverty in this country .                                    
1 0 not that we actually expected him to say yes .                                        
1 0 they all know how to avoid that question , or they would n't -- they would n't have gotten as far as they 've gotten in this business .  
1 0 on the same night john edwards was not running for president , joe keefe , another well-connected state democrat , was to host a little fete for john kerry ,
1 0 there was an opportunity to sort of see him in the flesh and reconnect and i think , for john kerry , an opportunity to stay in touch and keep
1 0 kerry had senate business , so the party was canceled .                                      
0 0 but he 'll be back to , uh , keep his options open .                                
0 0 he 's already been back , a month after he lost the '04 election .

1 0 welcome back to new hampshire , land of eternal politics .                                      
1 0 i think our perception is , it never ends .                                        
0 0 so it is n't that -- it is n't that early .

1 0 well , i ordered it online from the dem store last year .                                  
0 0 and it did n't get here until after john did not win the primary .                              
0 0 so , it 's been hanging on a hanger .                                        
0 0 and i thought , oh , good , i can wear the shirt tonight .                              
1 0 it is not just that some presidential suspects are showing up in new hampshire .                              
0 0 it 's that a lot of them are .                                          
1 1 let me see .                                                    
0 0 in terms of national figures , senator bayh has been to visit .                                  
1 0 republicans , just since the first of the year , we 've had bill frist up here , senator frist .                  
1 0 and we 've seen governor richardson from new mexico .                                        
0 0 we hear that we 're going to be seeing governor vilsack shortly .                                  
1 0 governor romney , senator allen and senator brownback .                                          
1 0 it 's so early that the buzz is more a hum , but the early hum goes to mitt romney , the republican with the movie star looks , and
0 0 but the sheer volume of candidates speaks to a race that , on both sides , begins on an even playing field , no incumbents , not even a vice
1 1 it 's a wide-open field .                                                
0 0 any boy or girl who dreamed about becoming president , this may be your time .                            
1 0 so , katie , bar the door , or at least the state line .                              
0 0 and that goes for iowa , too .                                            
1 0 in fact , if they all come at once , the 2.9 million iowans better get out of the way .                  
0 0 they 'll get run over .                                                
0 0 crowley : exceptions to the even-playing-field , the 800-pound gorillas , hillary clinton , who has yet to visit new hampshire this season , and john mccain , who has
1 0 of course , i have some very happy memories of my extended stay in your state several years ago .                    
1 0 they already have names .                                                  
0 0 they already have networks .                                                  
0 0 there is no rush .                                                  
0 0 there are people willing to hold their places .                                          
1 0 hillary , can you help us ?                                              
1 0 sure , but it will take me two terms to clean up this mess .                              
1 0 for all others , it is show time in new hampshire , working out the bugs , working on the message , just plain working it .      
0 0 edwards and kerry already have paid staffers planted in the state , helping local democrats .                            
1 0 most people are here trying to build , build the names , build a network , help somebody out , so that , in turn , you 'll be helping
1 0 grabbing a chit .                                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 you got it .                                                    
0 0 you know the game .                                                  
1 0 for the most part , they fly under the radar .                                      
0 0 but ready or not , the '08 presidential race is under way , no matter what you hear .                      
1 0 how often will we see you ?                                              
1 1 well , hopefully , i got to get myself reelected and then we 'll see .                            
0 0 but i like new hampshire .                                                
1 0 i 'm running for reelection next year in virginia .                                        
0 0 so , i 'm focused on that reelection .                                          
1 0 no one in new hampshire believes them .                                            
0 0 no one .                                                      
1 0 do you have any idea who your partner 's going to be in the presidential elections ?                          
1 1 well , i have n't decided what i 'm going to do yet .                                
0 0 so , no , i have n't gotten that far .                                      
1 0 not yet .                                                      
0 0 we will be watching the '08 prospects every step of the way , and so will cnn political analyst ron brownstein of the `` los angeles times . ''  
0 0 we missed you up there .                                                
0 1 but i 'll tell you , it 's a lot nicer now than in the snow .                          
1 0 it is .                                                      
0 1 you 're exactly right .                                                  
0 0 that 's the benefit of new hampshire .                                            
1 0 i asked all of them when i was up there , tell me how you gauge whether someone 's really running .                
0 0 what are the -- you know , what are the hallmarks ?                                    
0 0 do they have to go to this place ?                                          
0 0 do they have to go to that place ?                                          
0 0 when you look at who 's really serious , what do you look at ?                              
1 1 well , i think , first of all , i mean , you have a lot of people out there who understand they do n't have to make a final
0 0 and what 's really important at this point is to do the things that will enable them to run if they decide to down the road .      
0 0 so , what do you look for ?                                            
0 0 you look for people who are beginning to talk to fund-raising donors outside of their normal network , who are beginning to talk to some of the political consultants in
0 0 we have a long cast of characters who have been around the block and are beginning to travel .                      
0 0 certainly , someone like mitt romney , the governor of massachusetts , has made a number of high-profile trips , speaking to republican audiences , clearly putting himself out for
0 0 that 's the kind of activity .                                              
0 0 it does n't tell you they 're going to run .                                      
0 0 it tells you they want to have the option of running .                                    
1 0 what about money ?                                                    
0 0 at this point , does the money tell you anything ?                                      
0 0 i noticed that senator bayh , evan bayh , has raised more money than anybody else at this point from a pac .              
0 0 what does that tell you ?                                                
1 1 well , i think , traditionally , really going back at least until the 1980s , about 20 years , establishing a pac for the midterm election is one of
0 0 it funds their own travel .                                                
0 0 it allows them to acquire ious and chits with candidates by contributing to them .                              
0 0 so , that is -- that is one sign .

0 0 so , it 's not a sure sign that someone is -- is going to run .                          
0 0 it 's only that they want to have the option of running .                                  
1 0 in some ways , is what 's going on in new hampshire now , and will for the next two years or so , really the fight for who 's
0 0 you know , you heard me talk about the 800- pound gorillas .                                  
0 0 i mean , these are people that do n't really have to be there until the very end .                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 no , there are a lot of different slots in the race , i think , candy , in any race .                
0 0 and i -- i agree with the premise that , because this is an open seat on both sides , without a vice president running , in all likelihood ,
0 0 and so , one of the things that 's going to be challenging is to get noticed for anybody , whether it 's as the insurgent or as a conservative
0 0 there 's going to be an enormous challenge for these candidates just to draw attention to themselves in a field that could number 20 on both sides before it narrows
0 0 so , what -- i think what -- you 're not only seeing candidates go to new hampshire and iowa and meet some of the early activists , you 're
1 0 ron brownstein , `` l.a. times , '' thank you very much .

1 0 a leading conservative takes a stand on teaching creation .                                        
0 1 and senator rick santorum 's position may surprise you .                                        
0 0 also ahead , it 's been 40 years since congress delivered voting rights to all americans .                          
0 0 we 'll look back at that civil rights milestone .                                        
0 0 and when we go `` inside the blogs , '' what 's in a name ?

0 0 checking the `` political bytes '' on this friday , pennsylvania republican senator rick santorum is breaking with president bush on an issue important to many religious conservatives .  
0 0 santorum tells national public radio that , while he has problems with the concept of evolution , he is not ready for intelligent design to be taught in schools .
0 0 intelligent design is the idea that a creator , not natural selection , is responsible for the existence of the universe .                
0 0 earlier this week , president bush said he thinks intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution .                          
0 0 in santorum 's words -- `` i 'm not comfortable with intelligent design being taught in the science classroom .                    
0 1 what we should be teaching are the problems and holes -- and i think there are legitimate problems and holes -- in the theory of evolution .      
0 0 and what we need to do is to present those fairly from a scientific point of view . ''                      
0 0 new jersey senator and gubernatorial candidate jon corzine is drawing criticism from republicans over reports he forgave a loan of almost half-a-million dollars to his ex-girlfriend .

0 0 african-americans going to vote in the south in the 1960s did n't always get as far as the ballot box .                  
0 0 the voting rights act largely changed that , making it illegal for minorities to be denied .                          
0 0 bruce morton looks at how the act , which turns 40 this weekend , changed politics in the south and the makeup of political parties .        
1 0 in 1960s america , black and white americans marched to make sure southern blacks had the right to vote .                    
0 0 it took beatings to make sure southern blacks could vote .                                      
0 0 in philadelphia , mississippi , three civil rights workers -- two white , one black -- were murdered seeking that right .                
0 0 earlier this summer , 80-year-old ex-klansman edgar ray killen was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the manslaughter of those three young men .          
0 0 and , 40 years ago this weekend , president lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 .                      
1 1 we were black , yes .                                                
0 1 we were denied , yes .                                                
0 0 but we were americans .                                                  
0 0 and we had faith that we could make the constitution work .                                    
1 1 it did .                                                      
0 0 when congress passed the act , there were six blacks among its 435 house members , all from northern cities .                  
0 0 today , there are 42 .                                                
0 0 democrat john conyers represented the detroit district then and now .                                      
1 0 it has worked .                                                    
0 0 and it has done what we wanted it to do .                                      
0 0 but we also have a few decisions that we have to make that -- we have to correct a few court decisions that have scrambled it up a bit .
0 0 and that 's part of extending the provisions and strengthening the voting rights act of 1965 .                          
1 0 under the act , certain states and precincts , mostly in the south , must get federal clearance before changing voting procedures , moving a polling place , for instance
0 0 localities that have a lot of non-english speakers must provide ballots in other languages .                              
0 0 and the federal government can send election examiners to make sure voters are n't frightened away from the polls .                    
0 0 the act changed voting .                                                  
0 0 there are still complaints , but not the wholesale disenfranchisement of blacks that existed earlier .                            
0 0 and there have been political changes , too , whites switching parties , republicans favoring majority black districts , because they 'll gain white votes in the districts adjoining the
1 0 as blacks became enfranchised and started to participate in large numbers and have an impact on the democratic party , white southerners decided they would look for a different party
0 0 and they found one in the republican party .                                          
0 0 so , the enfranchisement of blacks fundamentally changed over a 20- , 30-year period the political landscape in the south and nationally , as republicans became the dominant party of
1 0 white democrats can still win in the south , but only with black support .                              
0 0 john edwards won a north carolina senate seat in 1998 with 41 percent of the white vote , but 91 percent of the black vote , for instance .  
0 0 and extending the act 's enforcement provisions , which expire in 2007 , that 's been controversial in the past .                  
0 0 but now , with both parties courting minority votes , it may be very easy .                            
0 0 bruce morton , cnn , washington .

0 0 we 'll join our blog reporters next for a commentary on the proposed name change and the online reaction to yesterday 's `` strategy session . ''      
0 0 a new effort to honor ronald reagan has bloggers talking .                                      
0 0 on that , we want to check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner , our blog reporter -- jacki .            
1 1 hi , candy .                                                    
0 0 well , as the dcist.com puts it -- this a blog that focuses on washington , d.c. -- there are two traditions that they like to make fun of .
0 0 one is texas politicians trying to make changes in d.c. and the other is trying to name everything in a five-mile radius after ronald reagan .        
0 0 and this came together when congressman henry bonilla proposed the renaming of 16th street , ronald reagan boulevard .                      
0 0 they have the details over at dcist .                                            
0 0 but this has a lot of people up in arms .                                      
0 0 sixteenth street , you might not know , is a major thoroughfare .                                  
0 0 it runs right up to the front of the white house .                                    
0 0 it is the 16 in 1600 pennsylvania avenue .                                          
1 0 and this local story has obviously got a political side to it .                                  
0 0 and political bloggers are really weighing in on this one .                                      
0 0 matt yglesias at tpmcafe.com is picking up on this , him and josh marshall saying this -- this is a stupid idea .              
0 1 yglesias also making the point that is n't it a shame that d.c. people -- d.c. citizens have to possibly rely on a virginia congressman , tom davis , who
0 0 but conservatives , too , really not happy about this one .                                    
0 0 this is `` the corner , '' thenationalreview.com 's blogging arm , where lots of people , lots of conservatives weigh in .              
0 0 john podhoretz over there is also saying this is an absolutely stupid idea .                                
0 0 `` renaming something so familiar is an act of government high-handedness and not something that reagan himself would like . ''                  
1 0 and frank gess blogging at andrewsullivan.com says that d.c. , one of the few places that rejected reagan 's reelection , putting out that they are going to continue to
1 0 but there was -- was n't there something else we were going to talk about ?                            
1 1 no .                                                        
1 0 we were .                                                      
0 0 there was something yesterday that happened .

1 0 what was that ?                                                    
1 1 oh , the novak incident .                                                
0 0 you did n't think that we were not going to actually talk about it , did you ?                        
0 0 we are going to .                                                  
0 0 for those of you who do n't know , bob novak left the set of this program yesterday after uttering an expletive .              
0 0 he walked off the set .                                                
0 0 cnn has apologized to its viewers .                                              
0 0 novak -- mr. novak has apologized to cnn .                                          
0 0 and cnn has asked him to take some time off .                                      
0 0 he has agreed to do so .                                              
0 0 we knew the blogs would pick up on this very , very quickly .                                
0 0 they did .                                                      
0 0 as far as we can tell -- this unscientific , now -- but as far as we can tell , the first one to pick it up was eschaton .
0 0 this is atrios.blogspot.com .                                                    
0 0 also , very quick on the draw on this story was thinkprogress.org .                                  
0 0 we figured it out .                                                  
0 0 we think that they had it all up within about 10 minutes after it happened .                            
1 0 yes , the speed was incredible , and , also , how many people were linking to this story as it came out .            
0 0 one of the first video bloggers to put it up there yesterday was john amato at crooksandliars.com .                        
0 0 he actually posted the video in four different places on his site , because he anticipated so many links .                    
0 0 and , indeed , he had 100,000 downloads of this story last night , after he put it out there .                  
0 0 usually , the entire site gets about 67,000 hits a day .                                    
0 0 so , quite incredible , the amount of people linking to that .                                  
0 0 he says -- he tells us , actually , an administrator to his site shut it down very -- just for a few minutes because they were worried that there
1 1 well , from that video , there 's a screen grab that is making the rounds .                          
0 0 people are wondering what is on the table between james carville , bob novak and ed henry .                        
0 0 and mysterypollster.com , one of the bloggers , has a photograph , one of those screen grabs .                        
0 0 and he e-mailed a larger blogger , mickey kaus over at slate .                                  
0 0 this is slate.msn.com .                                                    
0 0 and what they 're wondering is , was it in fact a copy of `` who 's who '' that was on the table ?          
1 1 and ed henry , who was doing the interview yesterday with robert novak before he left the set , confirms , yes , there was a `` who 's who
0 0 henry had wanted to ask the question whether he got plame 's name from there , from the `` who 's who '' or from karl rove .    
0 0 he anticipated asking that question at the end of the segment .                                    
0 0 incidentally , he tells us there was also a `` who 's who '' on the table in an earlier segment that week , on tuesday , when he planned
0 0 but that was preempted due to breaking news .                                          
0 0 so , bloggers are asking , is this the reason that robert novak asked -- left the set at that time ?                
0 1 that 's something for them to speculate .                                            
0 0 that 's not something i do .                                              
1 1 well , one of the things we do know is how fast they can get their hands on reference information .                  
0 0 and wizbangblog.com has a scanned-in copy of that entry from `` who 's who '' for joseph wilson .

0 1 you will , because this week marks its arrival as a force in american politics .

1 0 the blogosphere is supposed to be the realm of anarchy .

1 0 we raised around $ 550,000 from the netroots , which means we outspent the national republican congressional committee and were three times as relevant as the democratic congressional campaign committee

0 0 conservatives react to supreme court nominee john roberts ' past work for gay activists .                              
0 0 first up , a new associated press/ipsos poll shows public support for president bush 's handling of the war in iraq has dropped to 38 percent .      
0 0 that is the lowest since mr. bush ordered the u.s.-led invasion in march of 2003 .                            
0 0 this week alone , 28 american troops have been killed in iraq , raising the total death toll to more than 1,800 .              
0 0 president bush said that , despite the american deaths , the u.s. will stay the course .                          
0 0 at the same time , a combined american-iraqi offensive is under way in an insurgent hotbed in western iraq .                    
0 0 pretend you 're the white house .                                              
1 1 i think it 's awfully difficult to sustain a war at 38 percent approval of it .                          
0 0 what do you do to turn those numbers around ?                                        
0 0 well , the first thing is , there 's no question there 's an enormous uneasiness in this country about this war .              
0 0 they do n't see an end .                                              
0 1 and you see the death toll this week alone is 21 .                                    
0 0 you saw what happened out there in ohio .                                          
0 0 i mean , an anti-war democrat in a strictly republican district did extraordinarily well , almost beat the fellow .                    
0 0 so there 's obviously this uneasiness .                                              
0 0 it 's not just democratic ; it 's republicans .                                        
1 0 it 's across the board .                                                
0 0 and the white house , i think , has got to hope that they can hold on to some support out there and start moving our troops home after the
0 0 what do you do ?                                                  
1 1 just pretend you 're advising the president at this point .                                      
0 1 he 's got a problem .                                                
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 well , i think one of the things he might consider doing is leaving crawford , texas , and going to cleveland where there 's a memorial service for 16
0 0 perhaps he could explain to their parents and the people of ohio why their sacrifice was worth it .                      
0 0 i mean , that is the state that delivered the presidency to him .                                
0 0 and , you know , this is a war that he supports .                                  
1 1 he wants to stay the course .                                              
1 1 and he 's going to have to get out there and defend it , i think , a little bit more aggressively .              
0 0 there 's no question ...                                                  
1 0 it 's not going to probably be enough to just stand there at a lectern in crawford in the middle of your vacation and say , we 're going to
0 1 i think he 's going to have to be a little more aggressive .                                
0 1 he 's going to have to use the bully pulpit .                                      
0 0 there 's no question .                                                  
0 0 i agree entirely .                                                    
0 0 but he should not go to any funerals .                                          
0 0 these are private affairs of the family .                                            
0 0 it just makes it a big hoopla media circus .                                        
0 0 you do n't do that .                                                
0 0 you make certain that they have their private time to mourn , but to talk to them personally and also to give some type of a speech to talk to
0 0 we 've got the constitution we 're looking at .                                        
1 0 we 've got this government .                                                
0 0 and we hope that , by next spring , we 're bringing them home .                              
1 1 and if i could just interrupt , did n't he give a speech ?                                
0 0 did n't we just hear a speech ?                                            
0 0 we did , and it has n't worked .                                          
0 0 there 's an uneasiness .                                                  
0 0 they need to know what is happening .                                            
0 0 and they need to know how we 're getting home .                                      
0 0 there 's no light at the end of this tunnel for americans right now .                              
0 0 they just see us in there .                                              
1 0 they see our people dying .                                                
0 0 they see insurgents continuing to be successful .                                            
0 0 how does he balance that , though ?                                            
1 1 because you ca n't , like , signal to the insurgents , by the way , we 're leaving .                    
0 0 and yet he has to tell the american people , listen , by the way , we 're leaving .                    
0 0 well , and bay 's right .                                              
0 0 he absolutely has to .                                                  
0 0 i mean , one of the problems i think that the administration has had with this war from the beginning is that we went in for a reason that was
0 0 we went in to rid the country of weapons of mass destruction .                                  
0 1 it later became , you know , regime change , which we 've now accomplished , and we 're still there .                
0 0 and then at some point , you know , he tried to turn it into the war on terror , which i think is responsible , in some measure ,
0 0 the american people have figured out that we did n't go in there for a very good reason .                      
0 0 they 've figured out that they were n't told the truth about why we were going in .                        
0 0 and they figured out , i think , that the president does n't seem to have a plan to get us out of there .          
0 0 he needs to come up with one .                                            
1 0 he needs to articulate it .                                                
0 0 and he needs to use the bully pulpit to build some support .                                  
0 0 and , candy , 30,000 troops come home in february .                                      
0 0 people are going to start relaxing .                                              
1 0 they 'll feel a little more comfortable .                                            
0 0 but , again , he 'll have the problem of , what 's going to happen once we leave ?                    
0 0 now , let me -- i wanted you to look at this honesty poll .                              
0 0 do you think the president 's honest ?                                            
0 0 it 's gone from 53 to 48 .                                            
1 0 it has dropped under 50 percent in our latest poll .                                      
0 0 now , you know , the problem with that is , is n't it that anything he says now is certainly looked at under the cloak of most people thinking
0 0 well , in my opinion , the number , that particular number , is the worst news for the president in this poll , because it goes to a character
0 0 the american public , first of all , gives the president enormous benefit of the doubt .                          
0 0 and it 's difficult to get them to the point where they do n't think you 're honest .                      
0 0 secondly , it 's a character judgment that they 're making about him that has nothing to do with the performance of the war .          
1 0 so , for instance , you can have a policy disagreement about how the war 's being engaged and fought , and he can change that and perhaps change the
0 0 it 's very hard to change character-based numbers once they get to this point .                              
0 1 this is real trouble , there 's no question .                                        
0 0 and how does he get out of it ?                                          
0 0 he 's got to start acting .                                              
0 1 you know , he keeps talking about the economy 's doing well , and these trade agreements are going to be great , and whatever other bill is going to
0 0 and the people feel uneasy about that .                                            
0 0 they 're worried about their jobs .                                              
0 0 they 're concerned .                                                    
0 0 they do n't see the benefits what he 's talking about .                                    
0 0 and so , as a result , they stop believing him .                                    
0 0 he talks about the war on terror and how concerned we are , and they see an open border .                    
0 0 and they say , well , how can you be real serious ?                                  
0 0 the border 's open .                                                  
0 0 are we serious about this ?                                                
0 0 they 're ready for action .                                                
0 0 there 's uneasiness in this country , and it 's growing .                                    
0 0 and he 'd best take some real action to show he 's in charge .                              
0 0 he 's the commander-in-chief .                                                  
1 0 we have plans here .                                                  
0 0 we 're going in the right direction , and here they are .                                  
0 0 let me ask you to stand by .                                            
0 0 we 'll be right back .                                                
0 0 britain 's prime minister getting tough in the face of threats against his nation .                              
0 0 when the `` strategy session '' continues , we 'll examine tony blair 's proposed steps to combat terrorism and crack down on foreigners who preach hate .    
0 0 our `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics .                                        
0 1 with us today , still , democratic strategist steve mcmahon and cnn contributor bay buchanan .                            
0 0 british prime minister tony blair today proposed strict anti- terror measures aimed especially at foreign extremists .                          
0 0 the steps would allow the government to expel foreigners who preach hatred , close extremist mosques , and bar entry to muslim radicals .            
0 0 the move follows last month 's terrorist bombings and attempted bombings that killed 56 people .                            
1 0 at least three of the four men in custody for allegedly carrying out the failed attacks were immigrants from east africa .                
0 0 mr. blair said the british people are angry about extremism and about what extremists are doing to his country .                    
0 0 we welcome people here who are peaceful and law-abiding .                                        
1 1 people who want to be british citizens should share our values and our way of life .                          
0 0 but if you come to our country from abroad , do n't meddle in extremism , because if you meddle in it , or get engaged in it , you
0 0 well , they 're going to identify extremist web sites , extremist bookstores .                                
1 1 if you go to any of them , then the police can be looking at you .                          
0 1 we 're sort of out-patrioting the patriot act , it seems to me , here .                            
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 it does seem that way .                                                
0 0 i mean , it 's pretty easy in a climate that probably exists right now in england to promote and pass these kind of measures .        
1 0 the only thing i would suggest that they be mindful of is our experience with the patriot act , where it was passed shortly after 9/11 .      
1 0 there were a lot of good reasons for doing a lot of the things that were included in the patriot act , but there are a lot of people now
0 0 except for they renewed it .                                                
0 0 we did .                                                      
0 0 and there 's reason , because our law enforcement officers did not abuse the patriot act .                          
0 0 they understand the importance of it ; they understand how it should be used .                              
0 1 and that 's how they 're implementing it .                                          
0 0 so the american people continue to support it .                                          
0 0 what tony blair is doing is exactly the right thing .                                      
0 0 you have a country that 's unnerved by what 's happening .                                    
0 0 you have places blowing up .                                                
0 0 people are changing their way of life .                                            
0 0 he has to bring calm .                                                
0 0 he has to show that he 's the commander-in-chief there .                                      
0 0 he 's taking tough action .                                                
0 1 and that 's the message that our president has to do the same thing .                              
0 0 where 's our tough action ?                                                
1 0 we do have a patriot act .                                              
0 0 but look what 's happening in new york .                                          
1 0 well , i was just going to say , fine , so new york says , we 're going to randomly search backpacks as they go in , and what
0 0 they have a lawsuit by the new york civil liberties union saying , you know , it 's non-constitutional and it 's not effective .          
0 0 on the constitutional part , it is constitutional , if it 's properly implemented .                              
0 0 it 's been shown in the courts .                                            
0 0 however , i happen to agree with him on one point , it 's not effective .                          
0 0 they 're taking every fifth person on some randomly checked subway spots .                                  
0 0 if you do n't want to be checked , you say , fine .                                
0 1 you walk away , and go down another place .                                        
0 0 it is ridiculous .                                                    
0 0 and just like in england , what did they say in england ?                                  
0 0 we do n't have the troops to check everyone .                                        
1 0 we 're not checking little , old , white ladies .                                      
1 0 they happen not to blow themselves up in trains .                                        
1 0 steve , we 're talking about profiling .                                            
0 1 that 's what we need to do , profiling , exactly what we need to do .                          
0 0 well , bay 's talking about profiling .                                            
0 0 i thought -- i 'm talking about little , white ladies .                                    
0 0 listen , i think that , you know , i sort of part company with the new york aclu on this particular matter .            
0 0 i mean , obviously , when you have trains being blown up in england , it 's prudent and it 's responsible to try to do what you can to
0 0 i mean , the alternative , of course , is to just say to everybody -- what the airlines have done -- you know , you 're going to go
0 0 i do n't think there 's an easy answer and i do n't think there 's necessarily a perfect answer .                  
0 0 but racial profiling is problematic for a number of reasons .                                      
0 1 obviously , when terrorism is potentially involved , it 's a totally different question .                              
1 0 but it 's prone to abuse .                                              
0 0 and our experience in this country has been that abuse has been more common than , i think , most people believe it should have been .      
0 1 but when it 's abused , we will take appropriate actions .                                    
0 0 but in the meantime , it could be an effective way to stop any kind of an event like this , or at least hopefully stop an event such as
0 1 the key here is -- i believe that it is wrong to just randomly check people , if it is not an effective means , because all you 're doing
0 1 the mayor says , look , i 've really been responsible .                                    
0 0 he 's not being responsible .                                                
0 0 he 's being so cautious .                                                
1 0 he 's afraid to be politically incorrect .                                            
0 0 but when you 're at war , you move aside politically incorrect and you do what do to catch those bad guys who want to do harm to our american
0 1 but , bay , we 've been doing random checks on airlines now since september 11th .                          
0 0 and we 've kept the terrorists off the airlines , or at least we 've stopped more planes from being flown into buildings .            
0 0 so some of this stuff is working .                                            
0 0 it does n't necessarily have to be racial profiling .                                        
0 0 i do think , you know , stopping and frisking 90- year-old white women probably is n't the most productive use of law enforcement .          
0 0 i think most americans would agree .                                              
1 1 but , you know , there 's a long way between there and racial profiling .                            
1 0 and we just have to find ...                                              
1 0 eighteen- to twenty-five-year-old males seems to be a good place to start .                                  
1 1 and if you include 18- to 25-year-old white males , i think it 's fine .                            
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 1 listen , we have profiling every day in this country .                                      
1 1 and i do n't think there probably are a lot , all joking aside , of officers stopping 90-year-old white women .                
0 0 but as long as , you know ...                                            
1 0 i was going to say , twice in the last month .                                    
0 1 and i was traveling with a congressman .                                            
1 0 but you 're not 90 .                                                
0 0 bay , come on .                                                  
0 1 wait a minute .                                                    
1 0 exactly .                                                        
1 1 do i look like somebody who 's going to blow up the plane , for gosh sakes ?                        
0 0 well , bay ...                                                    
1 0 let me ask you to stop here .                                            
1 0 we 'll be right back .                                                
0 0 ... you are a buchanan .                                                
1 1 another big surprise from the files of supreme court nominee john roberts .                                  
0 0 when the `` strategy session '' continues , we 'll discuss roberts ' involvement in a gay rights case and the reaction from republicans .          
0 0 i 'm wolf blitzer , reporting from washington .                                          
0 0 coming up at the top of the hour , stung by a series of bloody insurgent attacks , u.s. and iraqi troops launching a new military offensive .    
0 0 the crew of a russian mini-submarine remains trapped 625 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean .                        
0 0 we 'll have the latest on the rescue effort .                                        
0 0 and it 's been almost a year since then-new jersey governor james mcgreevey announced he 's gay .                        
0 0 now he 's writing a book about it .                                          
1 0 all those stories , much more , only minutes away on wolf blitzer reports .                              
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics .                                        
0 0 with us , democratic strategist steve mcmahon and cnn contributor bay buchanan .                                  
0 0 virtually every day , new , intriguing information spills out on the files of supreme court nominee john roberts -- ane of the latest , his work in the mid-'90s
0 1 according to lawyers involved , roberts ' expertise helped them win a landmark ruling protecting gay men and lesbians from state- sanctioned discrimination .            
0 0 roberts ' helping hand was pro-bono , but he did n't disclose his role in the case to members of the senate judiciary committee who had asked about such activity
0 0 when the `` la times '' first broke the story , the white house scrambled to reassure roberts ' conservative backers .                
0 0 but not all apparently have been convinced , and the news triggered a flood of angry calls to conservative talk radio shows .              
1 1 i do n't know .                                                  
0 0 i suspect this should help him on one side , right ?                                    
0 0 if this had been a strategy , it would have been a really smart one .                            
0 0 but unfortunately for the white house , i suspect it was a mistake and not a strategy .                        
0 0 i mean , think about it .                                              
0 0 the guy comes out .                                                  
0 0 he 's supported by all the groups on the right .                                      
0 0 you know , he was acclaimed as the answer .                                        
1 0 and now this comes out , and , frankly , it 's the best thing i 've heard about him .                  
0 1 and i think it does indicate to some liberals that the guy may have an open mind .                        
0 0 it 's meaningless .                                                    
0 0 what he did was work in the background .                                          
0 0 he did not go -- he was not there in the court , did not take the case himself .                    
0 1 he just helped them to define which direction they should go in .                                  
0 0 the key question is , did he agree with the decision ?                                    
0 0 and it is not to say that , because of the work he did , he agreed with the decision .                  
0 0 i think the decision was an outrageous one .                                          
0 0 and that 's what we have to know , is whether he agreed with them .                            
0 0 i suspect he did not .                                                
1 0 it was pure activism on the court .                                            
0 0 he 's opposed to that .                                                
1 1 but think about it .                                                  
0 0 but leaving aside for a second that you 've probably -- you know , you think he 's a great choice for the supreme court , leaving that aside ,
0 0 let me ask you a journalism question .                                            
0 0 this is off of a press release from kay bailey hutchison , the senator from texas , who , in fact , has adopted children .        
0 0 and she is reacting to the fact that the `` new york times '' apparently started at least a preliminary look into the adoption process .        
0 0 and she wrote in her press release that , in fact , that she thought this was way over the boundary and that they should n't be looking at that
0 0 and she talked about -- she said , `` in my view , this inquiry by the 'times , ' no matter how preliminary the newspaper now says it was
1 0 i note the paper initially claimed this misstep was inadvertent , but it has now been reported that the newspaper consulted its lawyers to determine ways to unseal court adoption
0 0 in my view , this is reprehensible . ''                                          
0 0 outrageous .                                                        
0 0 utterly outrageous .                                                      
0 0 it just shows how very low the media will go today to -- it 's just there 's no justification to looking into adoption papers whatsoever .      
1 1 they 're criticizing the way they dress their children .                                        
1 1 they criticized how often ...                                                  
0 0 not in the `` new york times , '' i mean ...                                    
0 0 ... but the media itself .                                                
0 0 and then they criticized -- they 're talking about how often the wife goes to church .                          
1 1 and now they 're looking into the adoption .                                          
1 0 it 's outrageous .                                                    
1 0 well , listen , i think it 's in the gray area .                                  
1 0 gray ?                                                        
0 1 but i also think that this is a man ...                                        
0 0 gray ?                                                        
0 0 mcmahon : well , bay , this is a man who 's potentially going to be there for 40 years .                  
0 0 it 's one of the most powerful positions in the government .                                    
0 0 and you know , if this were a presidential candidate , all these things would be absolutely routine .                      
0 0 he 's not a presidential candidate .                                              
0 1 on the other hand , he 's not a private figure , either .                                
0 0 so ...                                                        
0 0 what about those records that you believe should not become public , which are very private , that should become public suddenly ?              
1 0 what is it that you all are looking at ?                                        
0 0 what is it that they would be looking it ?                                        
0 0 i 'd presume that those would be turned over to the senate judiciary committee .                              
0 0 it would become part of the record , in any event .                                    
1 1 so i mean , i do n't believe that this person was nominated with the belief that people were n't going to go snooping through his background .    
0 0 i mean , we know so little about him that ...                                      
1 0 let me just ask you , because we 've got 30 seconds .                                  
0 0 really , you think that , if there were a presidential nominee , and he had children that he had adopted , that those court records should be opened up
0 0 i do n't know .                                                  
1 1 but i think that this would be something that newspaper and other journalists would be interested in finding out .                    
1 0 and i think that , you know , if they had the opportunity to get it opened up , they would pursue it .            
0 0 absolutely over the line , whether he 's presidential , or he 's running for office , or whether he wants to be a judge , over the line .
1 0 bay buchanan , steve mcmahon , thank you so much .                                      
1 0 we appreciate it .                                                    
1 1 thank you .

    welcome back .                                                      
    a democrat lives in that white house you see behind us , but washington just 10 weeks away from complete republican rule and president-elect trump thinks that means getting a
    people will be very , very happy .                                            
1 0 what 's the top three ?                                                
1 1 well , we have a lot .                                              
0 0 we 're going to look very strongly at immigration , at the border .                                
0 0 we 're going to look very strongly on healthcare .                                        
0 0 and we 're looking at jobs , big league jobs .                                      
1 0 they have the votes .                                                  
0 0 they have the votes .                                                  
0 1 the question is what 's the sequencing ?                                            
0 0 and that matters .                                                    
0 0 because you go back to the beginning of the obama administration , and again democrats will say it was the republicans .                
0 0 republicans and blaming the democrats , but the environment quickly became toxic because he passed his big initiatives with no republican votes .              
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 so does trump try to reach out ?                                            
0 0 does he do something that involves the infrastructure that the democrats would like or does he do obamacare out of the box and alienate over democrats ?      
1 0 i think you 're going to see a mix of things as he can do administratively , things can be legislatively , things that would appeal to his base ,
0 0 now , replacing it would require bipartisan support , a much harder ordeal .                                
0 0 and then yes , i do think that you probably could expect some sort of infrastructure bill that could get democratic support .              
0 0 but if it 's a spending bill , that 's a stimulus that the republicans do n't like .                      
0 0 so it 's not a very simple task .                                          
0 0 the interesting thing will be how does he deal with it ?                                    
0 0 that did he delegated to republican leadership and the committee chairman on congress to write this legislation or did he drop it under the lap and try to push something
1 1 he is -- remember , the -- or the deal guy .                                    
0 0 that 's his whole thing like on negotiating .                                          
0 0 he was actually very honest during the campaign saying , `` you know what ?                              
0 0 this is my tax plan , but i 'm going to have to negotiate with whatever the congress is .                    
0 1 i 'm not going to get everything i like . ''                                      
0 0 as we continue the conversation , this is the tension .                                      
0 0 the never-trumps and other conservative said during the campaign , `` do n't believe him . ''                          
0 0 everything he says he does n't believe .                                            
0 0 the democrats said , you know , he has ideas that are -- they think some of that are racist , they think some of that are sexist the most
0 0 that 's just a little bit of sample here of candidate trump .                                  
1 0 but if i win , i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation , because there has never been so
0 0 there has never been anything like it .                                            
0 1 donald j. trump is calling for a total and complete shut down of muslims entering the united states until our country 's representatives can figure out what the hell is
0 0 but we will build a wall .                                              
0 0 mexico is going to pay for the wall .                                          
1 0 so does he appoint a special prosecutor ?                                            
0 0 his base will be furious if he does n't .                                        
0 1 it will cause poison in the well with democrats if he does .                                  
0 0 the muslim ban has disappeared from the trump website .                                        
0 0 and he modified that some during the campaign , but the idea 's now gone from the trump website what does he do there ?          
1 1 it 's one of the things that , you know , president-elect trump is going to be a work in progress , he 's going to grow into this job
0 0 many republicans hope he does not at least in this town , hope he does not appoint a special prosecutor .                  
0 0 he 's already sort of proven that point and even hints from a rudy giuliani and chris christie in morning interviews yesterday , the day before we 're suggested ,
0 1 perhaps he 's not going to do that , but we shall see .                                
0 0 we do n't -- i mean it depends which side wins out .                                  
0 0 the most key decision will be as chief of staff .                                      
0 0 who he puts in that position i think will tell us about which donald trump we 're going to see here .                
0 0 king : and it goes back to the tone .                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and please , everybody , jump in , i just want to put up this list of promises during the campaign .                
0 0 if you forget he said he would build a wall on the u.s.-mexico border , he said mexico would pay for it .              
0 0 a muslim ban or same variation of restrictions on people coming from countries where terrorism is a problem , repeal and replace obamacare .            
0 0 it 's very clear yesterday .                                                
0 0 the special prosecutor .                                                    
0 1 the negotiate nafta , reject tpp , those are trade deals there , those are -- one of the interesting things today is , you know , he 's --
0 1 even many of his supporters when he went to the rallies ...                                    
1 1 did n't believe it .                                                  
1 1 they did n't believe it .                                                
0 0 but they just knew he 's going to be tough on immigration .                                  
0 1 well , here is louie gohmert , one of the conservatives in the house essentially conceding , guess what , even if we build a wall or more wall mexico
1 0 and actually , you know , we 've appropriated money during the bush administration that did n't get spent for the wall .              
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 1 so yeah , it 's going to be great to some somebody that 's actually following the law .                      
1 0 essentially , he say look , we 've got the money , you know , we can figure this out our way .              
1 1 well and you noticed that that speech that trump gave on election night , or the wee hours of the day after , did not mention the wall , did
0 0 he did mention infrastructure .                                                  
0 0 he did mention jobs .                                                  
0 0 he mentioned rebuilding the inner cities .                                              
0 0 so that was a deliberate choice and i 've been told by someone involved that that was -- it was trump 's choice to make that speech , give that
1 1 and , john , it was interesting after that meeting with mitch mcconnell yesterday , donald trump walked out and you played some of that sound , when he was
0 0 he walked away .                                                    
0 0 he did n't answer the question .                                              
0 0 that was the end of the press conference .                                          
1 0 i have my own theory .                                                
0 0 and we can talk about it another day , about this nixon goes to china moment .                          
0 0 if only nixon could go to china , can only donald trump actually pass immigration reform that gets it ?                    
0 0 will he compromise ...                                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 ... and cut a deal ?                                                
0 0 that 's one of my theories as we go forward we 'll see what happens .                            
0 0 up next , some familiar , some controversial names .                                        
0 0 the new president looks to fill his team and has accused of embracing the very swamp he promised to drain .                  
0 0 but first take our quiz this morning .

0 0 learn the answer , just ahead .                                              
0 0 beautiful afternoon here in the nation 's capitol .                                          
0 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 if you 're curious about where president-elect trump owns resorts well , you call your travel agent or you can visit greatagain.gov .              
0 0 that 's that tax payer funded trump transition website .                                        
0 0 and just click on , meet the president-elect .                                          
0 0 as you can see here the official bio includes a list of trump properties .                              
0 0 many of which he also promoted during his campaign .                                        
0 1 we do n't need vacations , right ?                                            
0 1 we just meet the president-elect there we go .                                          
0 0 you know , i 'm having fun with this .                                        
0 1 some critics saying it 's tacky .                                              
0 0 that he could have just said donald trump is a big real estate developer business better not listed all properties .                  
0 0 i 'll leave that to the holder out there .                                        
0 0 but it does rise the question of what does this president do with his business ?                            
0 1 now , does he set up an ironclad blind trust run by an outsider or if he let 's his children run it , a lot of the critics and
1 0 well , remember this is a candidate who never gave us his tax returns .                              
0 0 i mean there is so much that we do not know about trump 's entanglements and , you know , financial , who he would , i mean ...  
1 1 that the authority to end the audit now .                                          
0 1 does n't he ?                                                    
1 1 yeah , exactly , exactly i mean you , but you have to -- the idea that his children can just move in and , you know , run all
1 1 and yet he should n't be punished ...                                            
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 he should n't be punished for having a business and then being elected president either .                            
0 0 so this is a hard one .                                              
1 0 it 's never been -- i mean it 's one of those many things .                              
0 0 we 're in sort of uncharted waters here on this .                                      
0 0 i mean his business dealings are complicated to say the least , what we know of them , but as maeve said we do n't know a lot about them
0 0 but of all questions that republican and conservatives had about the clinton foundation and any foreign governments giving in i mean this is magnified times 100 .      
0 0 so this is one of those things that the democrats and the clinton campaign will say , `` i told you so . ''            
1 0 he will have a republican congress or republican senate .                                        
0 0 so do you ca n't haven investigations by democrats .                                        
0 0 but this is something everyone is going to keep an eye on .                                  
0 0 democrats are going to look for a weakness , look for a misstep .                                
0 0 and even some republicans , hey look , he has plenty of republican critics and skeptics in that building too .                  
0 0 they 're going to be nice at first , but we 'll see what happens .                            
0 0 let 's move on to team trump .                                            
0 0 we only have a couple of minutes left .                                          
0 0 we 're waiting .                                                    
0 0 we 're told we could get a chief of staff announcement first .                                  
0 0 the leading candidate -- let 's show some leading candidates for jobs in the trump administration .                          
0 0 steve bannon , who is the breitbart executive who went to the campaign as the coo , he 's been mentioned as the potential chief of staff .    
0 1 the man in the middle is viewed by most people as the favorite at least at the moment , and this is donald trump , he makes his own decisions
0 0 reince priebus , the chairman of the party .                                          
0 0 and newt gingrich , the former speaker , has been mentioned either for chief of staff or may be secretary of state .              
0 0 chris christie is part of the transition team now , has been mention may be he 's attorney general , he could be your chief of staff .    
0 0 the same with rudy giuliani , the new one giuliani today has been secretary of state .                          
0 0 he 's also come up as navy and attorney general or homeland security , director of national intelligence .                      
0 0 to your point earlier jeff , who the president picks for these first early jobs is going to set the tone ?                
0 0 number one , he does need some washington hands and some government hands , because he 's never had that experience .                
0 0 or number two , steve bannon , for example .                                        
0 0 you know , i do n't know steve bannon personally but the breitbart website is viewed as a sometimes racist , sometimes nationalist , provocative , in your face kind
0 1 if you are a liberal african-american latino , if you make that choice , you 're making a choice .                    
1 0 and you can anger the republican leadership too .                                          
0 0 that 's the real issue as well .                                            
0 0 i mean breitbart has been going after paul ryan , mitch mcconnell so aggressively for such a long time .                    
0 0 so has steve bannon .                                                  
0 0 so doing that could cause a lot of problems for his own party .                                
1 0 the republican party ...                                                    
1 1 but , priebus is the inside guy who has good relations on capitol hill , but there were times during the campaign when he told donald trump , may be
0 1 there were times during the campaign where donald trump suspected reince priebus was trying to work the system in case they needed another candidate .          
0 0 ball : well , but think about the different signals that would be send by those three that you just named .                
0 0 so not only is bannon provocative because of the association with breitbart , but he is an ideologue , he believes that trump represents a new anti-globalist populist nationalism ,
0 0 priebus , obviously , traditional republican , voice of the establishment , would be building a bridge to the republicans in congress , and newt gingrich is much more about
0 0 he 's sometimes been critic of trump when he felt he was being impolitic and he has his own big ego , so he would -- it might be difficult
0 0 and giant question also is how many never trumpers or outsiders , people who were never on the team , is trump big enough to bring in ?    
0 1 that 's all part the conversation .                                              
0 0 were totally could get somewhere on this transition jobs as early as today , look for next week for some of the big jobs to be filled in .  
0 0 up next , a sneak peak into our reporters ' notebooks including how immigration reform advocates are getting ready for a battle with the new president and that will brew
0 0 first though , the results of our quiz .                                          
0 0 melania trump is only the second foreign born first lady who was first ?                                
0 0 was it martha washington , laura bush , louisa adams or jacqueline kennedy ?                                
0 1 about 94 percent of you got it right .                                          
0 0 the internet might have been involved there .                                            
0 0 it was louisa adams , john quincy adams ' wife .                                      
0 0 we 'll be right back .                                                
0 0 let 's close as we always do .                                            
0 1 head across .                                                      
0 0 i use to stay around .                                                
0 0 but this is in a cross the `` inside politics '' table , ask for our great reporters .                      
0 0 view a sneak peak into their notebooks .                                            
0 0 jeff zeleny ?                                                      
1 1 as we know democrats are decimated in this town , but one democrat is standing tall proud .                        
0 0 chuck schumer .                                                      
0 0 chuck schumer will be the most important democrat in all of washington for those who do n't know , he is the senate minority leader , or he will be
0 1 and the deals he cuts with this his fellow new yorker will be living in that the house right there will be fascinating to watch .        
0 0 the donald trump/chuck schumer relationship is something i 'll have my eye on next year .                            
1 1 and the important preexisting condition , as they say .                                        
0 0 maeve ?                                                        
1 1 still , i am looking at this battle that is beginning to brew out west .                            
0 0 you already have people around donald trump who are talking about his proposal for deportation force .                          
0 0 how much latitude he would have to , you know , start that process with executive orders , but i 've been talking to labor leaders and folks like antonio
0 0 they are already scheduling meetings , talking to civil rights leaders , talking about , you know , how they can slow this process down in a court .  
0 0 how they can fight , you know , with everything that they have if donald trump does , in fact , plan to move forward with those plans .  
1 1 one of the biggest questions for the new president-elect .                                        
0 0 molly ?                                                        
1 1 well , one of the interesting subplots to the election on tuesday is that marijuana was legalized in at least three states , possibly four .        
0 0 that 's recreational marijuana use , and medical marijuana in four more states .                                
0 0 big states , you know , recreational marijuana approved in california , medical in florida .                            
0 0 so there 's a lot of excitement in what 's now a very large industry that 's grown up around legal pot , but also some trepidation .    
0 0 donald trump has said that he favors medical marijuana but he has n't talked a lot about it .                      
0 0 he 's surrounded by old school drug warriors like rudy giuliani and mike pence .                              
0 0 so the is nervousness in the industry about what lies ahead for them .                                
1 0 we 'll see if the attorney general pick will say a lot about that .                              
0 0 manu ?                                                        
1 1 and yet another unusual moment this year , paul ryan seems to be safe for the speakership and no small part because of donald trump .        
0 0 donald trump 's coattails hoping to bring a larger majority in the house , making a very unlikely that 'll be enough defections to hurt him .      
0 0 next view , the house freedom caucus wants to focus on helping donald trump not hurting paul ryan right now , and paul ryan helping himself by going out and
0 0 those trump backers and his caucus are saying , you know , that they are happy with that .                      
0 0 so right now paul ryan stay for re-election in no small part because the man who wants to occupy the white house .              
1 1 we 'll watch the dealmaking moving on .                                            
0 0 i 'm going to close by saying a mix of quick thank you .                                
0 0 today ends our two-month temporary run here on weekdays .                                        
0 0 it 's been fun and it 's been fascinating .                                        
0 0 i want to say thank you to the great reporters likes these four here and the others who juggled their campaign schedules to make the hour what it is .

sentence: 
    it 's not nazi germany we need to worry about , it 's the friendly fascism of the 21st century .                  
    and i think the democrats the people who voted for hillary , first of all , feel good about the fact that the majority of your fellow americans did not
    that 's the majority by over 20 million .                                          
0 0 so take some comfort in that your fellow americans , you know --                                  
1 0 are with you .                                                    
1 0 -- are with you , number one .                                            
0 0 number two , we 've got to get active here .                                      
0 0 we 've got to --                                                  
1 1 i agree with that , but .                                              
1 0 can i just say this , let me just say this .                                    
1 0 and then i got to get one voice in here .                                      
0 1 you got to hear this guy .                                              
1 1 yes , go ahead .                                                  
1 1 so , i want to bring in chris vitale who i think got something important to say to you .                    
1 0 when i was a kid growing up , i listened to lee iacocca tell us how this country got screwed on trade deals .            
0 0 right now germany puts a 19 percent tax on an american car that get shipped to germany .                        
0 1 china does even more .                                                  
0 0 china does that to ensure production in china .                                          
0 0 nafta was supposed to create a mexican middle class .                                        
0 0 twenty five years later , the average mexican manufacturing wage is $ 2.97 an hour .                            
0 1 i do n't necessarily believe that donald trump is a hater , i think he 's a businessman .                      
0 0 tell me why i should n't have voted for him when my own union did n't back him , and his own party does n't back him on trade but
1 1 on that issue i ca n't tell you that you -- that i ca n't because what he says -- on what he 'll do , i do n't know
0 0 you know , but what he says is that nafta was wrong .                                  
0 0 he was -- that 's correct , it was wrong .                                      
0 1 key bp is wrong .                                                  
0 0 all the whole unfair thing that got set up .                                        
0 0 and democrats and republicans screwed the working class of this country .                                    
0 0 and the low unemployment that we have now is in large part due to the fact that you have some people have jobs , but they do n't have the
0 0 so -- but let 's see what he does with that because ultimately he 's a billionaire who looks out .                  
0 0 he has an ideology that he believes in and it 's called donald j. trump .                            
0 0 that 's what he 's going to make sure that he takes care of .                              
0 1 i do n't think he 's going to take care of you , the working person .                          
1 0 i think he 's done more for me than any democrat has done in my lifetime .                          
1 0 he has n't done anything for you yet .                                          
1 0 he raised the issue .                                                  
0 0 he raise the issue , and that 's more than any of them have done .                            
1 1 he raises the issue .                                                  
1 1 ok. let him talk , let him talk .                                          
0 0 what has you , and by the way , this is a --                                  
1 1 he raises the issue .                                                  
1 0 he 's a chrysler worker and he 's from a state -- i think you heard him called michigan .                    
0 0 and so what is --                                                  
1 1 and a county called macomb .                                                
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 0 i can tell you this no other politician in my lifetime has ever brought this issue to the forefront , and the fact of the matter is we do get
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 and they tell these companies to be more global .                                        
0 0 well , when you add $ 9,000 to the price of a jeep when it goes to germany , i 'm frankly amazed they can sell any of them over
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 vitale : and that needs to change .                                            
0 0 when he does n't follow through , when he does n't get rid of nafta , when you 're still screwed in michigan five months from now , two years
1 0 how do you know he 's not going to follow through , michael ?                                
1 1 there is nothing in his behavior .                                              
0 0 the man is first of all , a malignant narcissist and he 's only about in self , folks .                    
0 0 and you 're about to see that happening .                                          
1 0 hey , listen , i hate to say that --                                        
1 1 you can say the same thing about hillary clinton .                                        
1 0 wait , wait , hold on , guys .                                          
0 0 i hate to be the one to say this .                                        
0 0 it makes me feel very odd .                                              
0 0 but he 's not an idiot .                                              
0 0 he 's got to get re- elected --                                            
1 1 not an idiot .                                                    
1 0 he 's got re-elected by these guys .                                            
0 1 ca n't you give him a chance , at least on the stuff you agree with him on ?                      
1 1 i ca n't even imagine he 's thinking about re-election .                                      
0 0 i think i ca n't even imagine he 's thinking about , i have to do this for four years ?                  
0 0 not -- not fair .                                                  
1 0 ok , listen .

0 0 thank you , sir .                                                  
0 0 we got rebecca liebson here , a sophomore at the stony brook university .                                
0 0 so , she 's got a tough political question for you .                                    
1 0 hi .                                                        
0 0 so , i grew up in an area that 's been greatly characterized by political gridlock .                          
0 0 so , with that being said what do you think is the best move going forward for the congressional democrats ?                  
0 0 do you think that they are going to be as oppositional as the gop was under obama ?                        
1 1 well , i hope so .                                                
1 0 or do you think they 're actually going to try --                                      
1 1 no .                                                        
1 0 -- and retrousse the island for its concerned coalition ?                                        
1 0 no , no , no .                                                
0 0 this is not the kumbaya moment here .                                            
0 0 they -- the democrats in congress , they represent the majority of americans -- the majority of americans , let 's say it again , wanted hillary clinton .  
0 1 the majority of americans did not want donald trump .                                        
0 0 it is the responsibility of this minority of democrats in congress --                                    
1 1 hey , hold on .                                                  
1 0 -- to block , obstruct , disrupt and do whatever they can to prevent the onslaught that is going to happen with donald trump the american people do not support
1 1 hold on .                                                      
0 0 wait a minute .                                                    
0 0 i have -- i keep feeling so odd , sir .                                      
1 0 i know you 're in kumbaya moment .                                            
0 0 i 'm sorry .                                                    
1 1 i know exactly .                                                    
0 1 i feel .                                                      
0 1 but let me just push back on you at .                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 i 'm on the left side of pluto just like you .                                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 but let me just say a couple things here .                                        
1 0 i wore tie for you , by the way .                                        
1 0 and i appreciate that , sir .                                              
0 0 listen , when the republicans did this , they blocked our president on everything .                              
0 0 you know who suffered ?                                                  
0 1 those workers suffered , the kids in oakland suffered , the whole country suffered .                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 are you saying that now democrats should have a policy of imposing that same suffering for four more years ?                    
0 0 you 're saying we should n't even try to find any way out ?                                
1 0 your job is to stop the suffering that these people are going to cause , and let me tell you something , he 's going to be inaugurated on january
0 1 and it is the jobs of the democrats not to stop the suffering that he is about to create for the american people .            
0 0 that is -- that is their job , and they have to do it , and they better be planning it right now --            
1 0 and i got to tell you .                                              
1 0 -- instead of being the wimps that they usually are .                                      
1 1 well , and this is going to be , again , here 's the messy truth for democrats .                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 it 's easy to say that , but when you have to go back to a district and you got to say , we 're going to turn down infrastructure
0 0 because --                                                        
1 1 i 'm not saying -- i 'm not saying turn it down , i 'm just saying but they need to know when they go back to the district this
1 1 well , consider --                                                    
1 1 and we will -- and we will primary down these democrats if they do n't do their job .                      
1 0 consider yourself warned !                                                    
0 0 consider yourself warned .                                                    
1 1 that 's the messy truth .                                                
1 1 all right .                                                      
0 1 ok. well , listen , i want to thank you , and we had an honest conversation here tonight , but this is only the beginning .      
0 0 i hope that you are going to take this conversation back to your dinner tables , back to work tomorrow , the water cooler and your communities .    
0 0 thank you very much .                                                  
0 0 stay human .                                                      
0 0 cnn tonight with don lemon starts right now .                                          
1 1 thank you , van , from the messy truth to the breaking news tonight .                              
0 0 this is cnn tonight .                                                  
0 1 i 'm don lemon .                                                  
0 0 president-elect donald trump taking his thank you , america tour to north carolina tonight .                              
1 0 you went out and pounded the pavement , you organized your fellow citizens and propelled to victory a grassroots movement , the likes of which nobody , nobody has ever
1 0 and trump officially introducing his choice for defense secretary , retired general james `` mad dog '' mattis .                      
0 0 we 're going to begin this hour though ahead with cnn 's sunlen serfaty .                              
0 0 she is in north carolina tonight where she was at that suite .                                  
0 0 so , sunlen , this is the second so-called thank you rally .                                  
0 0 what did donald trump have to say and how was the crowd ?                                  
1 1 well , the crowd inside , don , certainly felt like that they were at a campaign rally .                      
0 0 a lot of energy from the crowd .                                            
0 0 but unlike his first thank you rally that we saw donald trump at last week , donald trump was much more subdued tonight .            
0 0 it was very clear he was trying to stick to script , really trying to really push his own message .                  
0 0 at one point it was interesting , the crowd started booing the media and he stopped them and said , no , no , maybe they will go on to
0 0 so , it 's quite a different change in tone and posture tonight coming from the president-elect .                        
0 1 really seemed determined to have his message be the headline coming out of this rally tonight .                          
0 1 and that message here really playing all to this military-friendly community , given that this is only a few miles from fort bragg .            
0 0 here 's a taste of what donald trump had to say .                                    
1 0 now today our brave men and women are the first in line defense , defense against radical islamic terrorism , words that some people do n't like to say ,
0 1 we 're going to protect our people , we 're going to protect our country , believe me .                      
0 1 in every generation , a new threat to freedom arises .                                      
0 0 and just as we defeated these threats , we faced generations in the past , and you understand that , so , too , will we defeat the forces of
0 0 it 's unseen in many cases , but we 're going to defeat that force , and we 're going to defeat it strongly and quickly .      
1 0 now there was a bit of showmanship coming on the part of donald trump when he rolled out his formal nomination for secretary of defense , general james mattis .
0 0 we of course , knew that news last week , but the two appearing here together at this rally tonight .                  
0 0 mattis took the microphone for a few minutes .                                          
0 0 interesting here , don , mattis will need a special waiver from congress because he only retired from the military three years ago .            
0 0 mattis speaking to that saying he 's looking forward to serving in a civilian capacity if he 's confirmed by the senate , and if indeed he does get that
0 0 and trump later going on to say he 's confident he will get that waiver and added that a lot of people will be angry if he does n't .
0 0 don ?                                                        
1 1 sunlen , thank you very much .                                              
0 0 i want to bring in now cnn senior political director david chalian , and cnn senior political analyst , mr. david gergen who was an adviser to four presidents .
0 0 good evening to both of you .                                              
0 0 mr. chalian , trump pretty much stayed on script tonight , nothing inflammatory .                                
0 0 did anything stand out to you ?                                              
1 1 well , what stood out to me was the discipline of the message , the clear attempt to be a uniter .                
0 1 he even caught himself .                                                  
0 1 you know , sometimes we hear donald trump sort of instruct himself aloud --                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 -- as if he 's repeating his adviser 's words .                                      
0 0 he started talking about poll numbers for half a second and then he said , we 're not talking about numbers , though , we 're trying to bring everyone
0 0 he clearly was trying to not have a barn burner and divisive and just play to his base .                      
0 0 he really was trying to set forth his 100 days agenda and bring people together .                            
0 0 the other thing , don , that i think the optics are so important to underscore here .                        
0 0 the defense secretary nomination of mattis .                                              
0 0 this is the first time we 've seen donald trump share the stage with one of his cabinet appointees .                    
0 0 everything else has been press release .                                              
0 0 this one he wanted to physically attach himself to this guy , and i think that that underscores how important he thinks this pick is .        
1 0 david gergen , i heard you 're in agreement there , his tone was a little subdued tonight , but he did take another swipe at china .    
0 0 look at this .                                                    
1 0 we will have two simple rules when it comes to rebuilding this country .                                
0 1 buy american and hire american , all right ?                                          
0 0 buy american .                                                      
0 0 on trade , our trade deficit now nearly $ 800 billion a year .                                
0 0 north carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since nafta .                                  
0 1 america has lost 70,000 factories .                                                
0 0 think of it , 70,000 factories since joining the world trade organization .                                  
0 0 think of it .                                                    
0 0 so , china joins the world trade organization , and since that time , we 've lost so much , 70,000 factories .              
0 0 we 're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world .                              
0 0 there 's never been a jobs theft like what 's happened to this country .                              
1 0 so , david , even before taking office , donald trump is showing a strong man approach to governing , but how is that going to play on the world
0 0 will it be effective ?                                                  
1 1 we 'll have to wait and see .                                            
0 0 he 's -- it 's clearly he 's caught up to putin and he seems to think that that 's going pretty well .            
0 0 i think the big surprise is how tough he 's been on china .                                
0 0 and we do n't know the chinese response has gradually ratcheted up over the last 48 to 72 hours .                    
0 1 so now that it looks like , you know , he really got their attention .                            
0 0 you know , what he seems to do , don , what he did with boeing today in his tweet and he did with , you know , he 's
0 0 and that 's what he 's done with china , you know .                                  
0 0 he got their attention , but where it leads , i think , is very , very unpredictable , and analysts are completely divided on that question .    
1 0 i heard you agreeing again .                                                
0 0 i 'm going to go back to what david said about his tone and staying on message .                        
0 0 do you agree with that ?                                                
1 1 i do .                                                      
0 0 the last time , the you know , the first rally was sort of spike the football rally .                      
0 0 and this time there was a lot less of that braggadocio , a lot less of the , and i think david chalian had it absolutely right , that he
0 1 it 's also important to remember in his message the substance of his message was to the troops , and it 's important to remember how close he was to
0 0 and not only introducing mattis , which one of the reasons that i think he took him there and showcased him as david said .          
0 0 but also basically making the argument we 're not going to intervene where it 's not in our paramount interest .                  
0 0 if it 's in our supreme interest , then we may go in .                                
0 0 and it is in our interest to go after isis , but our plan , his plan is to pull back .                
0 0 a lot of americans will welcome that .                                            
0 0 that 's what he said during the campaign .                                          
0 0 there was nothing particularly new in his speech today , but it helps you get a sense of where his emphasis is and the primacies that he 's placing on
0 0 i think he 's getting ready to turn a lot of his portfolio over to the day to day management over to the secretary of defense , secretary of state
1 1 is that really what he campaigned on , because he seemed to be much more aggressive in going after syria -- in going into syria , going after isis .
0 0 did he -- is that what he really campaigned on , david chalian ?                                
1 1 well , he certainly campaigned on this notion of pulling back , of america first , of not engaging in what he thinks were chaos conflicts .      
0 0 and this is why he was so adamant .                                          
0 0 do you remember the entire debate about his support for the iraq war on the howard stern show , but then he was so adamant to say , no ,
0 0 because he was trying to say this is n't a democrat/republican thing , this is donald trump trying to convince americans of a new way forward that is less entangled
1 1 all right .                                                      
0 1 david , david , stand by , everyone .                                          
1 1 ok .                                                        
1 0 up next , the stark contrast in both style and tone between donald trump and president barack obama .                      
0 0 we 'll be right back .                                                
0 0 donald trump becomes president in 45 days , and he 'll be a dramatically different leader than a man who 's been in the oval office for the last eight
0 0 back with me now , david chalian , david gergen , cnn -- and joining me now cnn political contributor van jones who just hosted the town hall event ,
0 0 welcome to the panel .                                                  
0 0 nice job .                                                      
0 0 congratulations on your special tonight .                                                
1 0 thank you , big brother .                                                
1 0 good job .                                                      
0 0 nice work .                                                      
1 0 and you said panic inducing ?                                                
1 1 exactly .                                                        
0 0 i think it 's panic inducing .                                              
1 0 people do n't realize when people are talking , you 're like , which way do i go ?                      
1 0 i know .                                                      
0 0 but thank you very much .                                                
1 0 it was a great special and we 're going to discuss it at length a little bit later on in this show .              
0 0 but donald trump was in front of a crowd tonight , probably his favorite place to be , while the current president barack obama gave his final national security speech
0 1 could the tone and the style , van , of each man be more different ?                            
1 1 no .                                                        
0 0 i mean , i thought we have to play a clip .                                    
0 1 no .                                                        
0 0 i mean -- and now that 's the most amazing thing that you 've seen is that , you know , we 're supposed to have one president at a
0 1 president obama is still the president of the united states , by the way .                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 he 's supposed to be able to complete what he 's doing .                                  
0 0 instead , you 've got the master showman stealing the spotlight over and over again , but they could not be any more different in their style or their approaches
0 0 this as sober as someone obama and the showmanship of trump , i do n't -- it 's hard to digest in the same news hour .      
1 1 and it 's going to be interesting to watch , you know , especially when they 're , you know , something huge , as he would say happens --
1 1 huge .                                                        
1 1 -- something huge happens to see him stand there and be presidential because he is such a showman .                      
0 0 let 's talk about the contrasting style , so just a little bit more .                              
0 0 we heard donald trump earlier .                                                
0 0 now listen to the current president barack obama talking about terror and the danger of giving terrorists too much attention .                  
1 0 the terrorist threat is real and it is dangerous .                                        
0 0 but these terrorists want to cast themselves as the vanguard of a new world order .                            
0 1 they are not .                                                    
0 0 they are thugs and they are murderers and they should be treated that way .                              
0 0 today 's terrorist can kill innocent people .                                            
0 1 but they do n't pose an existential threat to our nation , and we must not make the mistake of elevating them as if they do .      
0 0 that -- that does their job for them .                                          
0 0 it makes them more important and helps them with recruitment .                                      
1 0 so , david gergen , as you understand there as most people , he 's making a nuance point about the psychology of dealing with isis .      
0 0 contrast that with donald trump 's view for me .                                        
0 0 gergen : well , they 're both very good speakers but they are vastly                                
0 1 different styles .                                                      
0 0 and a couple points .                                                  
0 0 obama is cerebral .                                                    
0 0 trump is primal .                                                    
0 0 obama resorts to facts and logic .                                              
0 1 trump goes for emotions .                                                  
0 0 but the , i would call it the difference of logos versus pathos .                                
0 0 it 's a very different speaking style .                                            
0 0 and of course we know with obama , there 's no drama .                                  
0 0 with trump it 's all drama all the time .                                        
0 0 i thought primal , did you guys think when he said primal , that was an interesting choice of words ?                  
0 1 he chose that word very carefully .                                              
1 0 do n't you think -- do n't you think there 's something about where he 's coming from .                      
0 0 it is , it does have a primal quality to it , almost a primal screen to somebody say .                    
1 1 don , even though they 're --                                              
1 1 well --                                                        
1 1 -- even though we saw contrasting styles there , we also heard barack obama there talking to donald trump , basically .                
0 0 that was --                                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 -- that was the other sort of audience member that he was trying to speak to in those very comments .                  
0 0 he was trying to make sure to set the stage on his terms that donald trump will step onto .                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 go ahead .                                                      
1 1 but i do -- i do think that , as van alluded to , there is a little bit of line dot irrelevancy to the president at this stage ,
0 0 and i do n't say that disrespectfully .                                            
0 0 i just think that 's the reality of it .                                        
0 0 and donald trump 's venue tonight was right in the shadow of fort bragg .                              
0 0 and fort bragg has had a disproportionate lift in the middle east the last 10 years , and so i think rolling out mad dog mattis there to people who
0 0 and then he , you know , he --                                          
1 1 begin showmanship to van 's point .                                              
1 1 yes , showmanship and cheerleading .                                                
0 0 you know , just probably just pulling out that patriotism .                                      
0 0 and very little criticism of the press or other people tonight .                                    
1 1 that 's a good point there .                                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 jones : yes .                                                    
0 1 i think that one of the things that may happen is that we may wind up missing barack obama more as time goes forward .          
0 0 there is a danger with the kind of rah-rah belligerence .                                      
0 1 president obama is not wrong .                                                
0 0 they have studied the psychology of the recruitment .                                          
0 0 and everything that you do to either marginalize young muslims by making them , you know , feel like they do n't have a place , they do n't fit
0 0 everything that you do to sort of , you know , amp up there their meaning , a lot of young people want to be part of something that 's
0 0 by giving them all of this attention you 're actually helping the recruiters .                                
0 0 now that policy may change and we may wind up regretting it .                                  
0 1 right now it may feel great to go , yes , yes , we 're going to get them and talk about them all the time , but it may
0 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 like a , you know , a big hamburger and french fries feels great every day , but it 's not necessarily a good thing .        
1 0 we are going to talk about --                                              
1 0 go ahead , representative .                                                  
1 1 but the other thing that i do think is important that donald trump 's message tonight is we 're going to strengthen the pentagon and we 're going to pick
0 1 and barack obama 's footprint of war is bigger than george bush 's , at least geographically .                        
0 0 you know , we 're in libya , we 're in somalia , at least from the air .                      
0 1 we 're in yemen , and again , from the air .                                    
0 0 we left iraq --                                                    
1 1 representative , if i may , but i thought the criticism from conservatives on president obama was that he was not involved enough , he was n't aggressive enough .
1 1 too wimpy .                                                      
1 1 he was too wimpy , and now you 're saying he was too aggressive .                              
0 0 the footprint of war was too big .                                            
0 0 what 's -- what is the messy truth here ?                                        
1 1 no .                                                        
0 0 actually , though , yes , and let me say this .                                    
0 0 there is a republican hat and there is a trump hat when it comes to this , because mr. trump has said , you know , repeatedly , i was
0 0 but he -- i think his approach to the middle east is going to be                              
0 0 different .                                                        
0 0 i 'm not certain what his program will be in syria , for example .                              
0 0 we do know that he wants to talk to the russians about the defeat of isis , but not sure of what this is going to mean to the assad
0 0 but i do n't know that the average american associates his day-to-day life with what 's going on in somalia , yemen or libya .          
0 0 and so when barack -- excuse me , when donald trump is talking about we 're going to pick and choose our battles more carefully , i think there is
0 0 now , having said that , i do agree with you , the republicans in congress , john mccain is one of them , may have some major foreign policy
0 0 for now , mr. mccain is being very quiet about their differences .                                  
1 1 some ?                                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 go ahead , mr. gergen .                                                
1 0 well , he 's been quiet about it .                                          
1 0 after mr. gergen , i 'll give mine .                                          
1 0 i just want to add this point .                                            
0 1 i challenge the point that president obama is becoming less relevant or irrelevant as his days become numbered .                      
0 0 i actually think he in what he 's trying to do is set up a series of speeches and statements that shows he 's turning over a legacy in a
0 0 and that 's obviously true with regard to the economy , but he 's also now making the point that , hey , look , we 're doing better against
0 0 we 're making gains against isis .                                              
0 1 and --                                                        
1 1 whether people want to believe that or not it 's --                                      
1 1 whether people want to believe it or not .                                          
1 0 i got to get to the break , though , david .                                    
1 0 thank you .                                                      
1 1 and van , you want the last point .                                          
0 1 go ahead .                                                      
1 1 well , i just want to say that there are the hawks and the isolationists and trump makes promises to both .                
0 0 well , a promise to one is a lie to the other .                                  
0 0 at some point these things have to catch up .                                        
0 0 you 're either going to go over there and be more aggressive or you 're going to stay here at home .                
0 0 and at some point this conservative populist alliance is going to have to be rebalanced if it does n't -- if it does n't break .        
1 0 thank you , gentlemen .                                                  
0 0 some of you i 'll see you a little bit later on the show .                              
0 0 others , have a good night .                                              
0 1 thank you for coming on .                                                
0 0 up next , president barack obama delivering a subtle warning to his successor about national security issues .                        
0 0 in his final major national security address president barack obama reaffirm his counterterrorism strategy while also issuing a subtle warning to the incoming trump administration about some of their plans
0 1 i want to discuss this now with fareed zakaria , the host of fareed zakaria gps , of course , right here on cnn .          
0 0 fareed , on the same day that president barack obama defended his counterterrorism legacy the president-elect held a rally .                    
0 0 so , and he introduced `` mad dog '' mattis , his pick for defense secretary .                          
0 0 how much of today 's obama 's speech do you think was about knowing he was passing the baton on to a successor with an entirely different world view ?
1 0 you know , what i think he was trying to do more than anything else was to lay out his world view in a kind of honest way and point
0 0 so he began , actually , by pointing out that , look , here is my world view .                      
0 0 we live in a dangerous world , we have incredible military power .                                  
0 0 we can use it but we have to be discriminate , and we do not want to be nation building all over the world , we instead want to be
0 0 now that should be the message that actually if donald trump would have think about it , he agrees with .                  
0 0 trump and obama have this broader overlap on this kind of coarse , strategic way that they would use force than i think either of them is willing to admit
0 1 then obama moves to the differences , and that was very interesting and very pointed .                            
1 0 the differences .                                                      
1 0 the differences he pointed that he said , you know , isis is not an existential threat .                        
0 0 they are not going to destroy us .                                            
0 0 the only way they can destroy us is if we start cutting back on our civil liberties , if we start turning our society into something different .    
0 1 he pointed out -- you know , he went through a number of issues on                              
0 1 torture .                                                        
0 0 he said , i 've never -- you know , i scale back the use of any kind of torture and not one intelligence agency ever told me that we
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 you know , he went through a whole series of the kind of things trump has talked about .                      
0 0 he said american muslims deserve as many rights as anybody else , including those that serve in uniform .                      
0 0 we are not a country that believes in religious tests .                                      
0 0 so , he laid out these markers where , you know , the obama strategy is both different but is working .                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 but it 's important to point that he started out by saying -- you know , by presenting a strategy that i 'd be surprise if donald trump has huge
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 but he was speaking directly to the incoming president .                                        
0 0 but this , and i think this is the reason that this stood out to you .                          
0 0 listen .                                                        
1 0 but i 've also insisted that it is unwise and unsustainable to ask our military to build nations on the other side of the world or resolve their internal conflicts
0 0 instead , it 's been my conviction that even as we focus relentlessly on dismantling terrorists networks like al qaeda and isil , we should ask allies to do their
1 0 and that was to you broader point , to the point that you made .                              
1 1 i think that has been the core of obama 's strategy in terms of the middle east , in terms of the fight against terrorism , and it would surprise
0 1 you know , because that 's really trump 's instincts .                                      
0 0 all we have with trump are trying to understand his instincts , and his instincts seem to be beat up the bad guys but do n't go there and do
0 0 and in fact , that has been the obama doctrine .                                      
0 1 remember , when barack obama came into office , there were about 180,000 american troops in afghanistan and iraq .                    
0 1 we have 15,000 there right now .                                              
0 0 what he has done is he 's found a way to fight this war with drones , with special forces forcing the iraqis to get much more involved and be
0 0 now there are people who complain about that , but not donald trump , i do n't think .                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 and president obama , and you said when he first came into office , he said he wanted to close guantanamo bay .              
0 0 he argued about closing that again tonight and the banning of torture as well .                              
0 0 but here 's donald trump on torture back in june .                                      
1 0 can you imagine them sitting around the table or wherever they 're eating their dinner talking about the americans do n't do waterboarding and yet we chop off heads .
0 0 we probably think we 're weak , we 're stupid , we do n't know what we 're doing , we have no leadership .          
0 0 you know , you have to fight fire with fire .                                      
1 0 so , he has since walked that back a bit , but that 's the sort of talk that won him the presidency .            
0 1 tough talk .                                                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 people always say that we should n't take donald trump literally , we should take him seriously .                        
0 0 so , let 's assume there , as usual , you know , he probably does n't know exactly what the difference between waterboarding and torture and this variety of
0 0 he 's trying to say he 'll be very tough .                                      
0 1 and i think obama 's point in the speech was , we were very tough but you did not have to violate american values to be tough .    
0 1 you did not have -- you do n't have to register muslims in some kind of database , you do n't have to apply religious tests , you do n't
0 0 and the broader point that obama was making , which is very important , it really is one of the central , intellectual legacies he 's trying to leave us
0 1 this is a band of thugs .                                              
0 0 maybe there was a few thousand .                                              
0 0 maybe they can manage to do some spectacular act of terrorism , but they are not like the nazi armies marching through europe , they are not like the soviet
0 0 you know , this is a very limited , specific kind of threat .                                
0 0 we 're going to beat them up , we 're going to keep pressure on them , but let 's not surrender our values because we get so freaked out
1 0 and buy into a lot of rhetoric that a lot of people have bought into .                            
0 0 fareed , i want you to stay with me .                                        
0 0 because i want to ask you about your interview with president barack obama and i have a question for you about that .              
0 1 and also , where he reflects on being america 's first black president .                                
0 0 fareed zakaria is back with me now .                                            
0 0 he sat down with the 44th president of united states as his tenure winds down .                            
0 0 my question was before when we were talking about his foreign policy .                                  
0 0 he is above the glove , is n't he ?                                        
1 1 he is .                                                      
0 0 he is very cool , very unsentimental .                                            
0 0 the thing that i 'm struck about by him is there really is a spark-like quality .                          
0 0 he 's very disciplined but he 's also very ruthless .                                      
0 0 he does not -- i talked to him about drones and civilian casualties .                                
0 0 it does n't bother him a lot .                                            
0 0 he feels as though his job is to protect the american people .                                  
0 0 if he 's got to take out the bad guys , he 's going to take them out .                      
1 1 i want to talk , now let 's talk about your news special on president barack obama 's legacy .                    
0 0 it airs tomorrow night at 9 p.m. right here on cnn .                                    
0 0 and fareed spoke with him about his own identity about being the first black president .                            
0 0 listen to this .                                                    
1 1 the first line of your biography will almost certainly be not something you did but who you are .                      
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 the first african-american president .                                                  
0 0 and yet , you 're half white , you were raised by three white people , your mother and your two grandparents .              
1 0 and an indonesian you can throw in there .                                          
1 1 and an indonesian .                                                    
0 0 are you comfortable with this characterization of you ?                                          
1 1 i am , actually .                                                  
0 0 and the concept of race in america is not just genetic , otherwise the one drop rule would n't have made sense .              
0 0 it 's cultural .                                                    
0 0 it 's this notion of a people who look different than the mainstream .                                
0 0 suffering terrible oppression , but somehow being able to make out of that a music and a language and a faith and a patriotism .          
0 1 being black meant only the knowledge of your own powerlessness and your own defeat .                              
1 0 barack obama once felt quite differently about race .                                          
1 0 and the final irony should you refuse this defeat and lash out at your captors , they would have a name for that , too .        
0 0 a name that could cage you just as good .                                        
0 1 like paranoid or militant or violent or nigger .                                          
1 0 at a reading from his first book , `` dreams from my father , '' he told a painful story from his childhood when his grandmother expressed fear of a
0 0 obama : she 's been bothered my men before .                                        
0 0 do you know why she 's so                                              
0 0 scared this time ?                                                    
0 0 i 'll tell you why .                                                
0 0 before you came in , she told me the fellow was black .                                  
0 0 fear shook under my feet , ready to crack open at any moment .                                
0 0 i stopped , trying to steady myself and knew for the first time that i was utterly alone .                      
1 0 so that is closer to the -- when i lived in chicago , the barack obama that i knew back in the early 2000s .          
0 0 he had a different , he sort of spoke differently about race .                                  
0 0 and then in the beginning of his presidency , i think he was a little bit more hesitant even though he gave there a speech .        
0 0 and now do you feel that he 's more open about it , and more -- has he changed ?                    
0 0 is it a more nuance way and more honest about race ?                                    
1 0 you know , i think that he 's always struggled with this reality that he is biracial .                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 he was raised by three white people .                                            
0 0 his mother is actually scottish-irish .                                                
0 0 and yet of course , he is black that he looks black , he was treated as black , and so he 's always had the struggle which is he
0 0 and so that i feel bad for him because the poor guy is always navigating that .                          
0 0 and i think you 're right .                                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 he started this presidency much more cautious , much more careful to be just the president of america who happened to be black .            
0 0 and by the end of it , after all those racial incidents and with the iphone videos and trayvon martin and all that , i think he found -- he
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 -- half white and half black , where he could speak to the frustrations and aspirations of black americans .                    
1 0 well , it 's interesting , because i think that 's a -- that 's an experience that a lot of people of color , especially men of color ,
0 0 that you have to sort of code switch --                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 -- in order to gain confidence or to make other people comfortable even though it 's not fair that one must have to do that .        
0 0 so it must be an interesting experience to have to do it as a president .                            
    zakaria : i think it 's exactly right .                                          
    i think as an immigrant i see                                              
    that thing .

0 0 fareed zakaria talks with president barack obama about his triumphs and struggles during his years in the white house .                    
0 0 the special report , cnn 's special report , the legacy of barack obama , it airs tomorrow night at 9 right here on cnn .        
0 1 make sure you tune in .                                                
0 0 and coming up , when it country looks to its president to unify the people , will donald trump be up to the job ?          
0 0 as donald trump 's thank you tour rolls through the country , millions of voters are n't feeling particularly grateful for his victory .            
0 1 americans are still deeply divided by race .                                            
0 0 so , back with now is former congressman jack kingston , he was a senior adviser to the trump campaign , and political contributor van jones who just hosted the
0 0 all right .                                                      
1 1 so let 's have another messy truth conversation .                                          
1 0 you know , we always do on this show .                                        
0 0 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 so , i want to -- i want to look at the moment .                                
1 0 this is from your town hall just a little while ago here on cnn where you talked to a voter who chose president obama twice but voted for donald trump
0 0 you asked him about trump 's inflammatory statements on race .                                      
1 0 if you guys are , you know , raised the way that you were , i mean , you know not to say some of those things to people .
0 0 why did n't it make you vote against him ?                                        
1 0 because we hear it and we crumble it up and we throw it away and it does n't allow us to make our general decisions on what we 're going
1 1 we completely ignore that crap , that garbage , and we see what he has to provide for us outside of that .              
1 1 that 's tough .                                                    
1 1 you and i , and we would have gone back and forth about this , because i do n't know if i actually agree with you on that .  
0 0 yes .                                                        
1 0 they said his statements were distasteful but not disqualifying .                                        
0 0 does that trouble you ?                                                  
0 1 it 's heartbreaking but it 's not enraging .                                          
0 0 in other words , i think there was a moment when people were afraid that what was driving the vast majority of trump voters was all the racially inflammatory stuff
0 0 and there were some people who did love it .                                        
0 0 but there were also people who found it disturbing , distasteful , but not disqualifying .                            
1 0 so , i 'm not mad at him .                                          
1 1 it ' just breaks my heart that he would somebody under the bus , throw a muslim , throw a mexican .                
0 1 he said we just ignore it .                                              
1 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 and people of color .                                                  
0 0 here is what i said to you when you said that because people voted for donald trump that did not make them racist .            
0 0 i agree with you on that .                                              
1 1 but it does make them , because of some of the statements that were made , and some of the activity during the -- it does make you an enabler
1 0 and by being an enabler , does that then make you --                                    
1 0 i guess -- i guess --                                                
0 0 what does that make you then ?                                              
1 1 there is a heroic position of saying even if it 's going to cost my family a job i 'm going to vote against this guy because i want to
1 1 that 's the heroic position .                                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 then there 's the villainous position of saying , i 'm glad he 's going to stick it to those darkies .                
0 0 right .                                                        
1 0 but there is this other position in the enabler the bystander and it 's heartbreaking .                            
0 0 it 's not -- it 's not the best but i just do n't people to think these people are the worst , because they 're not the worst .
0 0 no , i understand what you 're saying .                                          
1 1 and that 's what this conversation is about .                                          
1 1 do they understand that --                                                  
1 0 it 's messy .                                                    
0 0 -- muslims , people of color , especially women of color who voted overwhelmingly for hillary clinton , they do n't have the luxury to ignore that because they 're
0 0 you know , i think that i learned , we are now all in our own filter bubbles .                      
0 0 they call them our own bubbles .                                              
0 1 and so , some people really do n't even know .                                      
1 1 they say , well , listen , donald trump is only talking about isis , why are muslims worried ?                    
0 1 then you talk to muslim families and they do n't know if they should n't leave the country because the way that -- the way that one person hears it
0 0 yes .                                                        
1 0 how will you be in a culture of bubble when someone says muslims should -- that 's not a filter bubble .                
1 1 that 's exactly what he said .                                              
1 1 he said , now to be clear now , to be clear , he said he wants to ban muslims from coming to the country .        
1 0 right .                                                        
1 1 but the ones here now feel more vulnerable .                                          
0 1 but people see that as him talking about isis .                                        
0 0 right .                                                        
0 0 well , exactly .                                                    
0 1 so there are some people who hear , well , he 's only talking about the bad ones .                      
1 1 but what they do n't understand is the way -- listen , if i -- when i said white lash , i said i was talking about --    
0 0 -                                                          
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 we 're going to talk -- we 're going to talk about that .                                
0 0 i want to get to jack .                                              
1 1 i want to get jack to talk about that .                                        
1 0 but i mean , but you understand , that whole one of the good ones things is insulting to , because we know the history of that , oh ,
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 like what the hell does that mean ?                                            
0 0 so , jack , a lot of people remember this .                                      
1 1 weigh in on this and then we 'll talk about the white lash .                                
0 0 jack , what do you think about the conversation we just had ?                                  
0 0 well , let me say this .                                              
0 0 for people who have seen their household income drop from 57,000 to $ 53,000 over the last 15 years , their number one issue is economics .      
0 0 they believe that their government has let them down .                                        
0 1 they believe that washington is about washington and not about them .                                    
1 1 and here comes a guy who says , you know what , blow it all up , i 'm different , i 'm not bought , i 'm going to
0 0 and you know , he took -- he took repeated trips .                                    
0 0 ok .                                                        
1 1 but you know , the guy who said that was bernie sanders .                                  
0 0 he took that message but he also added some other stuff that was very , very disturbing , did n't he ?                
0 0 well , let me say this .                                              
0 1 as a white man who grew up in integrated schools , and i 'd say in many ways was on the front edge of integration , i started in schools
0 0 and by the time -- and i was in the first white class to go to bernie harris high school in athens , georgia , it was a black high
0 0 and by the way , i 've been beat up because of my race .                              
0 0 i had been a victim of what would now be called a hate crime .                              
0 0 but let me say this .                                                
1 1 i 'm also secure in who i am racially and i do n't need donald trump or the media or whoever to define me racially .        
1 1 and so , you know --                                                
1 1 here 's i 'm -- first of all , if you were victimized , i think that 's terrible and i sure hope that you were able to get past
0 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 but here is my question to you .                                            
1 1 do n't you agree with me that that economic populist message that a bernie sanders had , that a donald trump often has , is one thing , but once
1 1 because that 's at the top of everyone 's list --                                      
1 1 so , you know , but let me say --                                        
0 0 -- not just -- not just white voters in the rust belt .                                  
0 0 i think we all have a filter .                                            
0 0 i mean , when hillary clinton has a rally and a the orlando terrorist 's dad is in the back row , democrats dismissed it very easily .    
1 1 and i probably say republicans could have done the same thing but it was still outrageous .                          
1 0 and then when she calls half of donald trump 's supporters irredeemable and deplorable --                              
0 0 that was offensive .                                                    
1 0 -- highly offensive , but it was easy for the left to say , yes , you know , no big deal .              
1 1 so , i 'd say that filter works in a lot of different ways .                              
0 1 but representative --                                                      
1 1 but should n't you only be insulted by that if you are irredeemable and deplorable ?                            
1 0 if you 're not in that category then why would you --                                    
1 1 i 'm just with you on that , don .                                        
0 1 i 'm just -- no , i 'm asking the question if you -- if someone says i 'm racist and deplorable and i do n't consider myself that --
0 0 no , no , but i tell you what .                                        
0 0 let me stick up for you , congressman .                                          
1 0 let me stick up for you .                                              
1 0 i thought that statement was completely unacceptable .                                            
1 1 i did too .                                                    
1 1 and i said , and i tell you what .                                        
1 0 you take personally --                                                    
0 1 if somebody said half the people at cnn are deplorable , even if i do n't think of myself as deplorable , i would still be mad because i know
0 0 but you have to wonder where -- but you have to -- van , hold on .                          
0 0 hold on , congressman .                                                  
0 0 i understand what you 're saying , van .                                          
0 0 but you also have to look at the evidence of whether someone in a particular group or a particular supporter is deplorable .              
1 1 i would say where is your evidence that someone at cnn is deplorable ?                                
1 1 if you said where is your evidence that some of donald trump 's supporters are deplorable --                          
0 0 some but --                                                      
0 0 -- or where is your evidence that some of hillary clinton 's supporters are deplorable , then you have to look into those supporters ' actions and figure out if
0 0 and if you 're not one of those , then why do you take personal offense to it ?                      
1 0 because i 've been called a lot of things , i do n't agree with those things , as representative kingston just said , i know who i am ,
1 1 so if i am not that , then why i am offended by someone calling me a name that i am not ?              
0 0 because nobody running for president of united states should say that half of --                                
1 0 i agree .                                                      
1 0 i agree with you .                                                  
1 0 -- is deplorable .                                                    
1 1 it should not have been said , but do you understand my point .                                
1 0 i do understand .                                                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 and i think there 's also a politically correct censorship that has permeated american universities in many cases and other venues as well where people ca n't speak their mind
0 0 i agree .                                                      
0 0 you know , van , you asked me if i got over being a victim of racial -- the differences .                  
0 1 i did , but you know , we were integrated in a very true sense .                            
0 0 i mean , we were sitting next to black children .                                      
0 0 we were playing sports with black children .                                            
0 0 we were going to the shower in the locker room with black children .                                
0 0 there was a time to hold a grudge because you just kept moving through the next day .                        
1 0 and i think that was one of the things that the '60s had that the -- today we do n't have , the millennial children i think they kind of
0 0 just some great stuff we 've lost because of being worried about being politically correct .                            
0 0 i do -- i think you 're right .                                          
0 0 i think you 're right about that .                                            
0 0 but you know , i do n't think anyone would want to go back to the '50s , '60s , or even '70s , but you 're right , people
0 0 thus , the reason we had van jones ' special tonight , and i 'm glad we did have it , and i 'm glad we 're having this conversation
0 0 and we 'll continue , but unfortunately i have to go because it 's the top of the hour and i got to the next hour .      
1 0 we went through the break .                                                
0 0 i 'm in trouble .                                                  
1 1 no food for us .                                                  
0 1 somebody --                                                        
    breaking news .

0 1 would you acknowledge the appearance of impropriety ?                                            
0 1 and should state department officials look into this further ?                                        
0 0 and for prime minister renzi , would the critical governing referendum having ensued in your country ?                          
0 0 what would passage mean for your ability to lead that country , and what would failure mean to your political future as well as to italy 's role in the
1 1 well , i 'm going to be a little more subdued in my discussions of the republican nominee in this context than i might be on the campaign trail .
0 0 but let me just speak broadly about russia .                                          
0 0 when i came into office , russia , under the previous administration , had invaded parts of georgia and created a frozen conflict there .          
0 0 there was a new president and we tried to initiate a more constructive path with respect to u.s.-russia relations .                    
0 0 and i think we showed russia plenty of respect , acknowledging enormous differences and different values , but also trying to find ways in which we could cooperate together .
0 1 we initiated a new start treaty , we assisted russia with respect to its ascension to the wto .                      
0 1 we worked on some common international challenges together , and when the previous president was replaced with mr. putin , i met with him and we discussed again , ways
0 1 the challenge that we had with russia is very much centered in russian aggression in some very particular areas around the world , in ukraine , where they have engaged
0 0 and even there , we 've tried to broker and work with the europeans to broker a minsk agreement that would peacefully resolve those issues .        
0 1 in syria , one of my earliest meetings with putin was to suggest to him , that if assad stayed in power , given brutality with which he treated his
0 0 rather than to work with us to try to solve the problem , he doubled down on his support for assad , and we know of the situation that exists
0 0 so , any characterization that somehow we have improperly challenged russia aggression or have somehow tried to encroach on their legitimate interests is just wrong .        
0 0 and mr. trump 's continued flattery of mr. putin and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on mr. putin ,
0 0 so you do n't have to explain to me how it is that some of the same leaders of the republican party , who were constantly haranguing us for even
0 0 the bottom line is , is that we think that russia is a large important country with a military that is second only to ours , and has to be
0 1 but their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways that we have to call them out on .                  
0 0 and anybody who occupies this office should feel the same way because these are values that we fought for and we protected .              
0 0 we ca n't go around talking about human rights or freedom of the press or democracy or freedom of religion or nondiscrimination or basic laws of war or the sovereignty
0 0 and you know , mr. trump rarely surprises me these days .                                    
0 0 i am much more surprised and troubled by the fact that you have republican officials who historically have been adamantly anti-russian and in fact have attacked me for even engaging
0 0 it 's quite a reversal .                                                
0 0 you 'll have to ask them how to explain it .                                      
0 0 with respect to the state department and the fbi reports , i think you 've heard directly from both the fbi and the state department that the notion or the
0 0 and you know , you can question them again .                                        
0 0 but based on what we have seen , heard , learned , some of the more sensational implications or appearances , as you stated them , are n't based on
0 0 i think that covers me .                                                
1 0 what are forms , i know 2016 is not a very good year to organize a referendum .                        
0 0 but i think the entire referendum is very simply in the message because it 's about the fight against bureaucracy .                  
0 0 and we need a great investment against bureaucracy in italy for a lot of reasons .                            
0 0 we change the '63 government in seven years , few times we joke about it with the president because it 's unbelievable , in a country that have a government
0 0 but it 's normal and the discussion , the political discussion is very strong .                              
0 0 my opinion is very easy .                                                
0 0 if , in december , we 'll win -- we will this referendum for italy , it will be easy , more easy to continue the battle to change europe
0 0 so the only consequence , constitutional reform a part in the political debate , in my view is , if we win , italy will be stronger and the debate
0 0 and so i work strongly and utterly to achieve the victory .                                    
1 1 .                                                          
1 1 ah , sorry .                                                    
0 0 grazie .                                                        
0 0 you 're american , not italian .                                              
0 0 yes , you 're american , american citizen .                                          
0 0 ok .                                                        
0 0 thank you so much .                                                  
1 0 or i can do it in english .                                            
0 0 but .                                                        
1 0 let 's talk about the referendum , because you hope to win , of course .                            
0 1 but we have found many investors at wall street who are worried about the fact that you might lose the referendum .                
0 1 these are investors that have faith in italy and that threaten , if there is a negative result in terms of the reforms , to just leave .    
0 0 so what can you tell these investors in order to reassure them to , if there is a negative outcome , will you stay on , will you continue with
0 0 and one last thing this evening .                                              
0 0 will you bring some wine to the dinner with the president ?                                    
0 1 this is an italian custom .                                                
1 0 mr. president .                                                      
0 0 i agree with the prime minister .                                              
0 0 your accent is beautiful , truly beautiful , so -- your italian accent of course .                            
0 0 on growth , you seem to be in agreement that there is -- that there is a need to sort of go ahead with the policy that you have pursued
0 0 the problem is that brussels is very rigid about and it 's very rigid with italian efforts therefore jeopardizing these efforts .                
0 0 what can you say to brussels , especially after brexit ?                                      
0 0 you know , they do n't seem to be moving on that front , you know , how important -- how important it is to move forward in that direction
0 1 thank you .                                                      
1 0 i have a feeling and i think that rightly so our american friends are a little bit more interested in november 8 than in the italian vote on constitutional reform
0 0 but in terms of what you are asking , very , very briefly , this is a time in which many investors throughout the world are coming back to invest
0 0 we are extremely happy about this .                                              
0 0 we 're happy about the investments on innovation in terms of technology .                                  
0 0 apple is investing in naples , amazon is going to open an artificial intelligence center in turin .                        
0 0 so , for the entire economic and financial world , well , they 're starting to see italy as an area in which to create opportunities and business .  
0 0 therefore , open doors .                                                  
0 0 i do n't believe that there will be any major disasters if the `` no '' wins at the referendum , but in order to have no doubts , i
0 0 i 'll do everything i can due to this atavistic doubt will not be able to come about but what is fundamental , what is true , is that the
0 0 this referendum does not have to do with the great world events , the great world issues .                        
0 0 very simply , do you want to simplify the institutional system in italy giving greater stability and certain times in which to have greater stability ?        
0 0 this is something to simplify things in our country and based on the question that was asked to the president on europe , we do respect the european rules and
0 0 we 'd like to do things differently but so long as rules do n't change we will respect them because italy has made of its reputation .      
0 0 one of the key words in its mandate , we work to change them but if they 're there we are going to respect them .        
0 1 now , what will happen within the next few months will be seen as a great singer -- italian singer says we will discover this by living so i 'm
1 0 during the course of my presidency , i have had repeated conversations with brussels , with angola , with francois others around how we could most effectively recover from the
0 0 it is fair to say that we have made more progress more quickly and what i 've tried to point out was the reason we were able to make progress
0 0 but then also , what was very important was quickly trying to fix the banks and infusing capital and making sure they were more stable , more transparent , and
0 1 and look , i 'm proud of our economic track record .                                    
0 0 we have grown faster and created more jobs , and this past year , seen incomes rise and poverty fall more quickly than a lot of our counterparts in europe
0 0 now , i recognize that europe is a more complicated collection of states , and it 's more difficult to move .                
0 0 and some are in the eurozone and some are not .                                      
0 0 and so i do n't expect that everything we 've done can immediately translate to europe .                          
0 1 and there 's some parts of what europe does that we could learn from , in terms of the social safety net , for example .        
0 0 but what i do know is that given the very slow growth that 's taken place in europe or a contraction over what is almost a decade now , you
0 0 and now that countries like italy and others have made real progress , their finances and their deficits , and there 's more market confidence in their position , now
0 1 because one of the reasons that we 've been able to cut our deficits by two-thirds is not simply because we cut spending by two thirds .      
0 0 we disciplined spending , but we also grew fast enough that more revenue came in and that 's one of the best ways for you to arrive at a sound
0 0 and monetary policy alone is not sufficient .                                            
0 0 i think mario draghi and the european central bank have done good work trying to maintain a positive trajectory in europe , but ultimately , there 's only so much
0 1 and my hope would be that matteo is right .                                        
0 0 italy has been true to its word in europe , and met its obligations , but my hope would be the debate broadens as europe moves forward around how to
0 0 those trend lines about europe do concern me , because if you look at the european experiment over the last 40 years , i said this in hanover , there
0 1 if it begins now splintering because their sense is the -- global capital and elites are not attentive to the ordinary concerns of people , that would be a tragedy
0 1 and by the way , yes .                                              
0 0 i think if -- i wo n't weigh in on the referendum , but the reforms matteo 's initiating , certainly on the economic side , are the right ones
0 1 aisha roscoe .                                                      
1 1 thank you , mr. president .                                                
0 0 i would like to ask you about the election .                                        
0 0 donald trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day .                
0 0 how concerned are you about the potential for violence ?                                        
0 1 and what about after election day ?                                              
0 0 are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted ?                                    
0 0 and for prime minister renzi , the offensive in mosul has begun .                                  
0 0 are you concerned about what happens after liberation ?                                          
0 0 and , mr. president , if you want to weigh in on that as well ...                            
1 1 i do .                                                      
1 1 ... appreciate it .                                                    
1 0 ok .                                                        
0 1 one of the great things about america 's democracy is we have a vigorous , sometimes bitter political contest and when it 's done , historically , regardless of party
0 0 that 's how democracy survives because we recognize that there 's something more important than any individual campaign .                      
0 0 and that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself .                            
0 0 because democracy , by definition , works by consent , not by force .                                
0 1 i have never seen , in my lifetime or in modern political history , any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even
0 0 it 's unprecedented .                                                    
0 1 it happens to be based on no facts ; every expert , regardless of political party , regardless of ideology , conservative or liberal , who has ever examined these
0 0 the notion that somehow if mr. trump loses florida , it 's because of those people that you have to watch out for , that is both irresponsible and ,
0 0 if you start whining before the game 's even over , if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose , you start blaming somebody else , then
0 0 that 's ok , you fight through it , you work through it , you try to accomplish your goals .                  
0 0 but the larger point i want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even -- you could even
0 0 there is no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time .            
0 0 and so i 'd invite mr. trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes .                  
0 0 and if he got the most votes , then it would be my expectation of hillary clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in
0 1 and it would be my job to welcome mr. trump , regardless of what he 's said about me or my differences with him on my opinions , and escort
0 0 that 's what americans do .                                                
0 0 that 's why america is already great .                                            
0 0 one way of weakening america , making it less great , is if you start betraying those basic american traditions that have been bipartisan , and have helped to hold
0 0 with respect to mosul , we are seeing the iraqi forces , with the support of the coalition that includes the united states and italy and other nations , moving
0 0 the intention is to drive isil out of what was its first major urban stronghold and what continues to be one of the key organizational and logistical and leadership hubs
0 0 i 'm confident that we can succeed , although it 's going to be a tough fight and a difficult fight .                
0 0 it is iraqis who are doing the fighting .                                          
0 0 and they are performing effectively and bravely , and taking on significant casualties .                                
0 0 there will be ups and downs in this process , but my expectation is that ultimately it will be successful .                  
0 0 and this will be i think a key milestone in what i committed to doing when isil first emerged , which was we were going to roll them back and
0 0 and we 've seen just steady progress on this front .                                      
0 1 now , you ask a very important question , which is if in fact we are successful , how do we deal with what could be a humanitarian crisis ?
0 1 because isil , when it occupies these territories , it bleeds them dry .                                
0 0 it feeds off of them .                                                
0 0 it oppresses the local populations .                                                
0 0 it 's not very good at governance .                                            
0 0 and so just basic functions like electricity or water start running down .                                  
0 1 people are fleeing from their homes .                                              
0 0 there will be significant displacement .                                                
0 1 this has all been part of the coalition planning process , in conjunction with the united nations , in conjunction with major aid organizations .          
0 0 and so we have put together plans and infrastructure for dealing with a potential humanitarian crisis that are as extensive as the military plans .          
0 0 that does n't mean that we do n't have to pay attention to it and executing will be difficult .                    
0 0 it 's going to still be a tough environment to operate under .                                  
0 0 and no doubt , there will be instances where we see some heartbreaking situations if in fact large numbers of people flee .              
0 0 it 's hard when you leave your home .                                          
0 0 it 's hard when you leave your home and you already did n't have a lot because you were living under an oppressive , barbarous regime .      
0 0 it 's hard to leave your home in a war zone .                                    
0 0 so , it 's not something that i expect will be easy .                                  
0 0 but i think it perhaps has n't been publicized enough , at least in the american press , the degree of planning and assets and resources that we 're devoting
0 0 because if we are n't successful in helping ordinary people as they 're fleeing from isil , then that makes us vulnerable to seeing isil return and feeding on the
0 1 and so there 's a strategic , as well as humanitarian interest in us getting that right .                        
1 1 i think about the mosul -- the considerations of the president are very clear .

0 0 donald trump as well .                                                  
0 0 we may take you out live to those events .                                        
0 0 with us here to share their reporting and their insights , jonathan martin of `` the new york times , '' jackie kucinich of `` the daily beast , ''
0 0 now , donald trump has made clear in the last 24 hours , he has no intention of releasing his taxes and no intention of apologizing .      
1 0 i have legally used the tax laws to my benefit , and to the benefit of my company , my investors and my employees .          
0 0 i mean , honestly , i have brilliantly - i have brilliantly used those laws .                            
1 0 now it 's a safe bet mike pence will be pressured to define `` brilliant '' tonight and defend trump 's refusal to share those taxes .      
0 0 the one year 's return leaked to `` the new york times '' in recent days shows a nearly $ 1 billion trump loss in 1995 .      
0 0 and experts say that means trump could have avoided paying any federal income taxes , legally , perfectly legally , for nearly two decades .          
0 0 trump calls that brilliant , as you just heard .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton calls it hypocritical .                                                
1 0 in other words , trump was taking from america with both hands , and leaving the rest of us with the bill .              
1 1 so this has been the defining issue , ladies and gentlemen , or lady and gentlemen , i should say , i guess , on the campaign the last few
0 1 and we assume , right off the bat , tim kaine gets the first question .                            
0 0 i would not be surprised if they asked him about the sunrise or the weather today in virginia , which is beautiful , if he turns this to a conversation
0 0 why not donald trump ?                                                  
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
0 0 and that 's going to be mike - mike pence has - he has the tough debate tonight .                      
0 0 he 's been trying to defend donald trump the entire time , while keeping his own political aspirations intact .                    
0 0 so he really - in terms of the two candidates , he really does have the tougher job than tim kaine .                
1 0 is that - yet , yet tim kaine comes in knowing his candidate has momentum and he better not drop the baton .              
1 0 well , i think that for - for tim kaine , he 's going to try to keep mike pence on the defense , as jackie said .    
0 0 but mike pence also has an opportunity that donald trump was n't able to pick up on at hofstra , and that is to prosecute at every possible turn the
0 0 donald trump missed opportunities .                                                  
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 i - i would suspect that mike pence will not miss opportunities in the way that donald trump did .                    
1 0 in a sense he can do what he 's been doing all along and play , you know , cleanup , pickup , whatever you want .      
0 0 and i think , i mean , he can sort of slow hillary clinton 's momentum a little bit , or at least be - do what he 's been
0 0 but that may take the full 90 minutes for that .                                      
1 0 i think the forecast tonight , john , is going to include a lot of talking points .                        
0 0 i think both of these candidates are going to take all of these questions and use them the best that they can to reframe it and talk about their opponent
0 0 as you point out , this is a proxy war .                                      
0 0 i think kaine is going to be talking a lot about trump and i think pence is going to be talking a lot about hillary .        
0 0 and my guess is that these are two veteran disciplined politicians , and i think that 's what you 're going to see tonight .          
1 0 so -                                                        
1 1 in stark contrast to last week , by the way .                                      
1 1 so , to that point , let 's stay on the tax issue then for a minute .                        
0 0 as we watch the proxy war play out tonight , we 'll see if mike pence can change the conversation .                  
0 0 first , i just want to show you a few things from our new cnn/orc poll .                          
0 0 this is not just the media this - attention focus this story .                                  
0 0 should donald trump release his tax returns ?                                            
0 0 overall , 73 percent of the american people say , yes .                                    
0 0 look at the partisan breakdown , 95 percent of democrats say yes , 75 percent of independents say yes , and almost half of republicans say yes , 49 percent
0 0 now , why has n't he released his taxes ?                                        
0 0 is he hiding something ?                                                  
0 1 we asked that question .                                                  
0 0 eighty-six percent of democrats say donald trump is hiding something , 59 percent of independents think that , only a quarter , 24 percent , of republicans .    
0 0 so he 's on safer ground on the motives among republicans , but almost half of republicans want him to release .                
0 0 and so what are you doing to - what do you do ?                                  
0 0 if your answer is , no , i wo n't release them , donald trump yesterday , and we 'll see if governor pence prosecutes it this way tonight ,
1 0 they have n't added a single dollar of value , people like hillary , to the american economic .                      
0 0 hillary clinton has n't made an honest dollar in her entire life .                                  
0 0 all she does is takes from you , takes from your country , and peddles influence to donors , special interests and foreign actors for astronomical dollars like you 've
0 0 it 's corruption of the highest order .                                            
1 0 so deflection , if you 're not going to answer the questions people are asking about you , you attack your opponent .              
0 0 is that - can they work ?                                              
0 0 will it work ?                                                    
1 0 it 's going to work much better for mike pence tonight .                                    
0 0 this is someone who he went through three gubernatorial debates .                                      
0 0 he is someone who has done this before .                                          
0 0 and as you said with tim kaine , he could be asked , what color is the sky and he 'll be talking about donald trump and his taxes .
0 0 and i think you 're going to hear mike pence do the same thing with hillary clinton 's in e-mails , with the hillary clinton and her - the unreleased
0 0 he 's got a whole realm of things to pick through .                                    
0 1 and unlike donald trump , i think he 's going to take every opportunity to do so .                        
1 0 here 's the answer that i 'm curious about , that i assume that pence has teed up .                      
0 0 what does he say when tim kaine turns to him and says , mike , why is it ok for you to release your taxes and you did you that
0 0 so , you know , what 's that difference ?                                        
0 0 what does pence say when kaine points that out because , honestly , pence did take that step and put his taxes out .            
1 0 do n't - do n't you - do n't you assume he 'll say what they 've been saying all along , well , he said he will release them
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 when the audit is done .                                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 now , that - you know , that may be a weak reed to stand on -                          
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but it is something he can say .                                            
1 0 he 's bought time with that excuse for -                                          
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 for a while now but it 's tougher because now , you know , there 's been other sort of talking points about why he 's not releasing his taxes
1 0 well , and hillary clinton said yesterday , release them up to 2009 then .                              
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 king : trying to take some of that excuse away .                                      
0 0 if you 're under audit now , release at least some of the older ones before this existing audit .                    
0 0 i do n't think that argument 's going to with donald trump either .                                
0 0 one of the things that i 'm interested tonight , these are two - as you know , jackie , more practiced candidates .            
0 0 they 've done this before .                                                
0 0 they 're also more cautious than donald trump anyway .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton 's very cautious .                                                
0 0 but she got under his skin in the first debate , especially by questioning the loan from his dad to start the business and his business acumen .    
0 0 trump , on the trail yesterday , you could tell , this one still burns with him .                        
0 0 hillary clinton says donald trump does n't have business acumen .                                      
0 0 donald trump says , oh , yes , i do .                                      
1 0 i was able to use the tax laws of this country , and my business acumen , to dig out of the real estate mess , you would call it
0 1 in those most difficult - i 'm a star .                                        
0 1 thank you .                                                      
0 0 you are , too .                                                  
0 1 oh , they were amazing times .                                              
1 1 he 's trying to spin this , you know , where she 's questioning , essentially saying who - who can lose a billion dollars with a casino ?  
0 0 the house never loses .                                                  
0 0 how can you do that ?                                                
0 0 she got under his skin .                                                
0 0 he 's trying to fire back .                                              
1 1 no doubt .                                                      
0 0 and i was in ohio with her yesterday and it was one of the - you know , she still has that spring in her step from that debate .
0 0 but even - it was more exaggerated yesterday , i think , being able to seize on this and -                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 you know , he ca n't be such a genius losing a billion dollars in a year .                        
0 0 but what i was struck by yesterday , she was responding to him in more real time than she has done really throughout .            
0 0 he was in colorado in the afternoon , and they 've gone from a thing of genius to brilliant .                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 she 's seized on that almost instantaneously in a rally in akron .                                  
0 0 so i assume that tim kaine , tonight , will seize on - on the genius and brilliant line .                    
0 0 and his base is with him , yes .                                          
0 1 but as we 've seen from our polling there , people do care about tax returns .                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 so no way you slice it , this is not a good moment for donald trump on this issue .                    
1 0 taxes is the gateway to what ?                                              
0 1 and if you look at that polling again , half of republicans , 95 percent of democrats , that 's pretty predictable .              
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but half of republicans say he should release them .                                        
0 0 if you talk to a lot of republican strategists , if you talk to the speaker of the house , paul ryan , he said , i released mine .
0 0 now they accept the audit - publically , they accept the audit excuse to a degree -                          
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but it 's the gateway to what and to who , i guess , at this point -                        
1 1 well , it 's the gateway to finally giving her a fairly effective populist cudgel that she really has n't been able to wield in the past .    
0 0 she 's tried here and there to go after him on , you know , hurting - hurting the little guy , talking about his stiffing contractors or what happened
0 1 this , i think , offers her the best opportunity yet to really strike him with a simple attack , which is , everybody else has to pay taxes in
1 0 it 's also what they 're used for , though .                                      
0 0 she said yesterday a lot , the military .                                          
0 1 he 's criticized the military for being - being weak , but he was not paying for that .                      
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 or roads or other things .                                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so , for those in the middle , those moderate voters concerned about this , the voters i talked to in ohio yesterday , at her rally for sure ,
1 0 i think one thing that `` the new york times '' story does that 's helpful to clinton is that it takes the issue a little bit away from ,
0 0 it 's not like people are going to vote in november .                                    
0 0 but the question of what he was as a businessman , how he ran his business , the degree to which she 's able to use that or kaine is
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 to go after trump is more important than simply , why have n't you released your taxes ?                        
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 and she 's saying he takes advantage of the system , the loopholes , the special breaks that wealthy people get over the little guy , at a time when
0 0 balz : and - and she 's more likely to get under his skin with that                            
0 0 argument than simply saying , you should release your taxes .                                      
0 0 all right , everybody sit tight , a big night ahead tonight here .                                
0 0 the crowd already in - on campus getting excited .                                        
0 0 up next , mike pence 's debate playbook .                                          
0 0 it includes a focus on foreign policy and important outreach to conservatives .                                  
0 1 welcome back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 we have live pictures , haverford , pennsylvania .                                          
0 0 there 's chelsea clinton .                                                  
0 0 she 's at an event focusing on families with her mother , the democratic nominee for president , hillary clinton .                  
0 0 we 'll dip in there live if they get to anything of note for you .                            
0 0 a busy day on the campaign trail .                                            
0 0 donald trump also on the campaign trail this hour .                                        
0 0 michelle obama out as a surrogate for hillary clinton .                                        
0 0 we are live in farmville , virginia , longwood university , the site of tonight 's vice presidential debate .                    
0 0 and , you know the old adage , the best defense is a good offense .                            
1 0 and we know all about the foreign governments and foreign donors who were contributing to the clinton foundation at the same time she was secretary of state .    
0 0 and that does n't even talk about the fact that she had a private server , that she sought to erase e-mails with high technology , even got out a
0 0 men and women , we 've got to have the highest standards of integrity in the highest office in the land .                
1 0 let 's focus for a bit on the mike pence playbook tonight .                                  
0 0 and in a sense , and we 'll get to tim kaine a little bit later , vice presidential candidates are always the lesser known , but in this campaign
0 0 the number twos do n't get that much attention at all , and yet , let 's show - just a little - quick show you a baseball card who
0 0 mike pence is 57 .                                                  
0 0 he 's the indiana governor .                                                
0 0 he 's also been a member of the house republican caucus in the congress .                              
0 0 his appeal , obviously the rust belt , social conservative .                                      
0 1 his priority tonight is to sell trump as that change agent , right ?                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 to try to make the - make positive out of some of the things that are negative .                        
1 0 i think there are two things that he brings to the campaign .                                  
0 0 one                                                          
0 0 is some reassurance to conservatives that there will be conservative values at the heart of this trump/pence ticket .                      
0 0 the second thing he does was - he is - he has been helpful in trying to reassuring donors that , you know , that the donor class , which
0 0 he has good connections with them .                                              
0 0 so i think those are the two big things that he 's been able to bring to the ticket .                    
1 0 he also likes to fundraise , unlike donald trump .                                        
0 1 yes , he actually likes that part of campaigning .                                        
0 0 the other thing with mike pence is , he is so disciplined in terms of messaging .                          
0 0 when i was going through his - his gubernatorial debates the last couple days , i had to go back and look at the - which one i was actually
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and it 's very - he 's very hard to rattle and he 's very hard to get off that message .                
0 0 so that 's going to be a real challenge for tim kaine tonight , to get him to say something that maybe he would n't had said otherwise .  
1 0 he 's fluid in conservative-ease in a way that trump is not .                                  
0 0 it does n't come easy to trump and , obviously , we 've sort of seen him struggle at times , you know , talking , for example , about
0 0 pence , i think , was effective at being able to reassure them , to dan 's point , about the values of this ticket .        
0 0 i think that 's one of the biggest challenge trump has .                                    
0 0 it 's not that evangelicals are going to support hillary clinton , they sure wo n't , it 's the possibility that they 'll either skip the top of the
0 0 and if you 're trump , you ca n't afford to lose any of those born again christian voters .                    
1 0 it 's also his biggest opportunity to do something that jackie mentioned earlier .                                
0 0 he 's been trying all along to thread the needle about his future , in case his -                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 you know , he 's not successful in november .                                        
0 0 this is his biggest audience , his biggest opportunity -                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 to keep his own brand intact .                                              
0 0 so usually these vice presidential debates are not about themselves .                                      
0 0 i think in his case this is a touch more about him because he may have something down the line if this does n't work out .      
1 0 and let 's go back in time .                                            
0 0 let 's go back in time to our reporting a couple weeks before the republican convention where we were told that the trump staff was trying to push governor pence
0 0 the republican party was saying , who is this guy ?                                      
0 0 is he one of us ?                                                
0 1 about donald trump .                                                    
0 0 they were pushing pence and trump was making clear , he wanted to go with his heart and his gut , somebody like chris christie .        
0 0 so they 're - once pence was picked , it was the traditional `` 60 minutes '' interview with the running mates , just a little bit of flavor here
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 clearly , this man is not a politician .                                          
0 0 he does n't speak like a politician .                                            
1 0 he 's done pretty well .                                                
1 0 he 's - he speaks from his heart .                                          
1 0 i think - i think it 's a good thing .                                      
1 0 he speaks from his heart .                                                
0 0 and -                                                        
1 1 well , i think i speak from my heart and my brain , just so we understand .                        
0 0 most people .                                                      
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 this is maybe more important .                                                
1 0 so - that was the interesting , awkward getting to know you moment , including - including in that interview , leslie stahl asked donald trump , but mike pence
0 0 and donald trump said , well , it 's a long time ago , it does n't matter .                      
0 1 and she said , well , wait a minute , you say it 's central to hillary clinton 's judgment but you give mike pence a pass ?    
1 1 i mean it was unusual , but we are going to hear that tonight , of course .                        
0 0 his voting record is going to be front and center in this .                                  
0 0 but again , i still think - i mean as jonathan said earlier , these are two - i mean if there are gentlemen still in this business , these
0 0 so i do n't expect them to be , you know , sparring nearly as much as last week .                    
0 0 but they do have to get their points in there .                                      
0 0 so tim kaine has been very fiery on the campaign trail .                                    
0 0 very aggressive against donald trump .                                                
0 0 i 'm watching to see what his sort of anger level is here because he is the attack dog in every way , more than mike pence is .  
1 0 well , and i think it 's interesting because mike pence does not have a reputation as an attack dog .                  
0 0 he has a reputation as somebody who can stay on message and deliver a message .                            
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but he has not been somebody who has been a slasher in his campaigns .                              
0 0 and so both because of that and what you just said , jeff , in terms of having to strike that balance between being loyal to donald trump and preserving
1 0 and in terms of his discipline , we talked a bit earlier , donald trump left a lot of opportunities on the table in the first debate .    
0 0 he blamed the moderator after .                                                
0 0 but , again , you can ask somebody if you like apple pie and you can talk about the clinton foundation .                
0 0 you can ask somebody what time of day it is , and you can bring up the e-mail server .                    
0 0 one thing mike pence has done repeatedly on the trail , and we expect it to come tonight , is attack hillary clinton 's record as secretary of state and
1 0 and it was hillary clinton who left americans in harm 's way in benghazi , and after four americans fell said , what difference at this point does it make
0 0 as the proud father of a united states marine , let me say from my heart , anyone who said that , anyone who did that should be disqualified from
1 0 it will be interesting to watch tonight as he presses these attacks , whether he waits - he waits for a moderator to take him there , or whether he
1 0 i think he wo n't wait at all .                                          
0 0 he 's a former talk radio host as well .                                        
0 1 he 's a very , very good communicator .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 one of the best in his party .                                            
0 0 i think he 'll go right after that .                                          
0 0 we 're also probably going to hear a lot of military talk .                                  
0 0 he is the father of a soldier , as well as tim kaine .                                
0 0 i think that is something that both of these two men bring to the table that is different than most vice presidential candidates .            
1 0 and one thing mike pence is going to have to answer , i 'd be shocked if tim kaine does n't bring it up if the moderator does n't ,
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 and he implied that some people are weaker than others .                                      
0 0 and if you 're weak , you might end up with ptsd , which is actually the opposite of what 's been - it stigmatizes it , which is not
0 0 king : right .                                                    
0 0 and the trump campaign is saying that if you took it that                                    
0 0 way , then donald trump - that 's not what he meant .                                  
0 0 if he tripped over his tongue a little bit , that 's not what he meant .                          
0 0 that he wants to help people with ptsd , with mental health services .                                
0 0 but it 's certainly something democrats are seizing on .                                        
0 1 jonathan , hold the thought .                                                
0 0 we 'll be right back in a second .                                          
0 0 next , the numbers do n't lie .                                            
0 0 this race , as we wait for this big debate tonight , is swinging back clinton 's way at a crucial moment .              
1 1 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 there is no doubt , as we head into the vice presidential debate , that donald trump is paying a price for his performance in the first presidential debate .
0 0 let 's look first at our new cnn national poll .                                      
0 0 and look at this , a five-point lead for hillary clinton in the national poll , 47 percent to 42 percent .                
0 0 you see the third party candidates getting a combined nine .                                      
0 0 that is a boost for hillary clinton in national polls , but we elect president state by state .                      
0 0 is it carrying over to the key swing states ?                                        
0 1 and the answer at the moment is , mostly , yes .                                    
0 0 look at these .                                                    
0 0 new polls showing clinton plus five in florida , clinton plus three in north carolina , clinton plus four in pennsylvania .                
0 0 trump still leads in ohio by five .                                            
0 0 that 's important .                                                    
0 1 but clinton comfortably ahead in colorado and virginia as well .                                      
0 0 there is no way to draw a path for donald trump to 270 without florida , north carolina and ohio .                  
0 0 so while ohio 's encouraging , this is a problem for donald trump and good news for secretary clinton after debate number one heading into the vp debate .  
0 0 now , why is this happening ?                                              
0 0 a number of reasons .                                                  
0 0 but here 's one , donald trump will win among white voters who lack a college degree .                        
0 0 the challenge for hillary clinton is to try to keep it close .                                  
0 0 and , look , back in september in our poll , 68 percent of white voters without a college degree are for trump , 24 for clinton .    
0 0 you see that right there , more than 40 points , 44 points .                                
0 0 now look .                                                      
0 0 she 's narrowed the gap .                                                
0 0 she 's still losing , but she 's narrowed the margin there .                                  
0 0 very important gain for hillary clinton among white voters who lack a college degree .                              
0 0 here 's another important one from our new national poll , independents .                                  
0 0 if you go back to our poll in early september , donald trump up 20 points among independents .                      
0 0 now , secretary clinton leading among independents by seven points .                                      
0 0 if she wins among independents on election day , you can bet the ranch she will be the next president of the united states .          
0 0 so watch these numbers after the vice presidential debate and after the second presidential debate sunday night .                        
0 0 heading into that contest , listen to secretary clinton on the road .                                  
0 0 she seems pretty certain we 're going to have a few more momentum swings .                              
1 0 but i need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for trump .                  
0 0 i know you know people .                                                
0 0 i know you do .                                                  
0 0 and you 've got to stage an intervention .                                          
0 0 you 've got - you 've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done

sentence: 
    voters give republicans full control of congress , sent president obama a blunt message .                              
    to everyone who voted i want you to know that i hear you .                                
    but talk of getting along is immediately tested by white house plans to take sweeping executive action on immigration .                    
1 0 when you play with matches , you take the risk of burning yourself .                                
1 0 it 's like raving a red flag in front of a bull .                                  
1 0 after six years of distrust is there really any hope for deal making .                                
1 0 and we 're going to make them squeal .                                          
1 0 does the 2014 republican wave mean a thing as we shift immediately to the 2016 presidential race ?                        
1 0 frankly , i that yesterday was a repudiation of hillary clinton .                                    
1 0 true or just wishful thinking ?

0 0 thanks for sharing your sunday morning .                                              
1 1 julie pace of the associated press , manu raju of politico , jonathan martin of the `` new york times and nia-malika henderson of `` the washington post . ''
0 0 the optics as the political consultants like to say were just about perfect .                                
0 0 president obama and bipartisan congressional leadership around the table for a post-election white house lunch on friday complete with this conciliatory words from the host .        
1 0 i 'm not going judge ideas based on whether they are democratic or republican .                              
0 0 i 'm going to be judging them based on whether or not they work .                              
1 0 looks good , sounds about right .                                              
0 0 but , pay little or no attention .                                            
0 0 it is , when it comes to the big issues anyway , sadly a charade .                            
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 1 because the president is days away from sweeping executive action on immigration despite warnings from speaker john boehner and the soon to be majority leader mitch mcconnell -- that such
0 0 julie pace you covered the white house everyday they have to know that immigration is likely to become health care .                  
0 0 i say that in the context that the president came out of the box in 2009 .                          
0 0 a lot of people said do n't do health care first , do n't poison the well .                        
0 0 he did health care first , he poisoned the well .                                      
0 0 republicans either -- democrats are saying that 's not fair , that 's not fair .                            
0 0 that 's how republicans took it .                                              
0 0 when he does this on immigration they have to know that they are going fire up the republican base and make compromise from that point out harder .    
1 0 and the great irony in all of this is that the white house chose this timing .                          
0 0 they had planned to do this before the election .                                        
0 0 they decided not to in part because democratic senators had asked them not to .                              
0 0 they chose to stick this right after the election when they knew there was a good chance republicans would win .                  
0 0 and you know there is some merit to what republicans are saying .                                  
0 0 obviously republicans had a chance to vote on immigration legislation and they decided not to do it in the house .                  
0 0 but they won this election .                                                
0 0 and they have to have an opportunity to push forward their agenda and if the president does this you can just see everything that they are talking about compromise on
1 0 but they have to know this at the white house .                                      
0 0 it 's part of the calculation to stoke the republicans , to see what happens .                            
0 0 because the one way the president get his momentum back is if the republicans over read and overstep .                      
0 0 if they start running around saying impeach him -- impeach him he just did this executive action .                        
1 0 that 's right and i mean there are a lot of folks in the republican caucus who do not want this to happen and may start mouthing off about it
0 0 so there 's that as well .                                              
0 0 i think that 's part of the obama 's calculus .                                      
0 0 i also think obama has sort of played this before with republicans , wait and see and gave them a chance to do something and they did n't so in
1 0 to that point does he have no choice in the sense that the speakers made clear he 's not ready to do this and the senate bill expires at the
0 0 they are furious at this president because they think he has put it out there and pulled it back , put it out there and pulled it back time and
1 1 yes it 's hard to see any bill moving out of the house on immigration given how the house has gotten more conservative , by the way , sort of
0 0 the president knows what he 's doing on this .                                        
0 0 this is a long term play for his legacy with hispanics and immigration but it 's a long term play i think a lot of folks at the white house
1 0 but speaking of the party you do start to hear from some democrats over the last day or two people saying , you know what ?        
0 0 let 's go back to john boehner and say hey john why do n't you just have an up or down vote on this at least make that gesture and
1 0 you know the challenge is going to be the timing of this because the continuing resolution , the government funding expires on december 13th and if the white house moves
1 0 there was n't much goodwill in the well to begin with .                                    
0 0 and now the republicans call this poison , is there are -- look i assume they will agree at some point maybe next year on infrastructure bank because the 31
0 0 the president and the republicans can maybe do some business on trade because the republicans are more with it than the democrats .              
0 0 but on the big stuff we just talked about the immigration issue .                                  
0 0 can the president you know if the republicans come to the table they 're going to have a vote on repealing obamacare .              
0 0 they promised it in the campaign they do n't have the vote so they will fail .                          
0 0 the question is if they come back later and say let 's fix it and change things will there be any goodwill to do that ?        
1 1 i doubt it .                                                    
0 0 and it 's not so much john because of the senate it 's because of the house .                        
0 0 i mean look , i think that you could have seen legislation move in the past few years if we had a unicameral legislature with just the senate .  
0 0 but the fact is we have a house which is a much more conservative body and i think it 's going to be harder to get much out of there
1 0 the president does n't have a good relationship with mitch mcconnell .                                    
0 0 you had an article not that long ago saying mitch mcconnell called me once along in the oval office .                    
0 0 they need both of them -- need to work on that but can he go to boehner .                        
0 0 can he go to boehner and say hey let 's pay you know we failed on repealing let 's pass these changes .              
0 0 i can get enough 2016 democrats to come around for these six or eight or these four or five you 've got to give this to me in the house
1 0 i think if the white house were to get something in exchange for say a medical device tax repeal , that 's something that does have bipartisan support maybe then
0 0 is it a must pass bill that the president has to sign to keep the government funded .                        
0 0 if it 's something like that that has bipartisan presumably we could go along .                              
1 0 what about the dna of the principles here ?                                          
0 0 you have the president , leader mcconnell , speaker boehner .                                      
0 0 mcconnell and boehner used to be deal makers .                                          
0 0 but their own , do they have the leash , do they have a long enough leash given the politics in their own republican caucuses number one ; and the
0 1 is there any reason to believe the next two years he says i want to be lbj ?                        
1 1 well he 's -- not only does he not like it he 's just not very good at it .                    
0 0 it does n't come naturally to him .                                            
0 0 i think one of the questions will be who he surrounds himself with .                                
0 0 the staff looks pretty similar .                                                
0 0 the cabinet 's pretty similar .                                                
0 0 how much does he bring biden into this ?                                          
0 1 i mean biden i think could actually be a major player in this .                                
0 0 he has a relationship with mcconnell , he has a relationship with boehner and he gets the art of deal making .                
1 0 and i would just add that you know mcconnell really feels                                      
0 0 emboldened by his victory .                                                  
0 0 he took on the right .                                                
0 0 he beat them .                                                    
0 0 he 's feeling very good right now .                                            
0 0 he is probably going to have 54 senators in his caucus that gives him a little bit of wiggle room .                  
0 0 so if people like ted cruz want to create problems and ok go create problems but then maybe can get democratic support as he moves a little bit to the
0 1 he seems confident in taking on the right for right now .                                    
0 0 i mean that could certainly change in the coming months .                                      
1 0 but we have two sets of dynamics .                                            
0 0 how do the republicans deal with their internal politics and then how do they deal with the president .                      
1 0 yes and that 's the big problem .                                            
0 0 for one , the president we 've seen him go on these sort of charm offensives before and they did n't really working .            
0 0 then you have a kind of raucous caucus in the house and then ted cruz wanted to make some noise because he 's ted cruz and he likes to do
1 0 we have n't mentioned congressional democrats in this conversation which i think is telling .                              
0 0 and i think it 's -- but i do see if the president does tries to do business let 's say he tries to cut a deal on entitlements with
0 0 then i can see elizabeth warren as the new ted cruz jonathan coming to the floor and saying over my dead body -- right ?          
1 0 not just in senate but you 'd have house democrats saying the same thing .                              
0 0 they would say mr. president you 're going to be leaving in 2016 .                                
0 0 we 'd like to actually win the house back at some point .                                  
0 0 if you deny us that issue what are we possibly going to run on ?                              
0 1 that 's democrats bread and butter politically and i think they would be very concerned about losing that issue especially in the house where they really want to get the
1 0 and that 's why you have n't heard entitlement reform being mentioned by the white house .                          
1 0 and if we learned anything from this election though is that there are a lot of -- there 's a lot of tension between obama and congressional democrats .  
0 0 there 's not a reservoir of goodwill there with his own party .                                  
1 0 and he 's still the leader , de facto leader of the democratic party .                              
0 0 but i think loyalty -- remember what happened to george w. bush after the 2000 -- let 's forget about --                  
0 0 all right let 's sit tight .                                              
0 0 much more to talk about .                                                
0 0 yes huge wins but also some red flags for republicans hopes of taking the white house back in 2016 .                    
0 0 and should hillary clinton be happy or worried ?                                          
0 0 first though this week 's `` politicians say the darnedest things -- the president , the senator and the drink they just ca n't seem to schedule .    
1 0 actually , i would enjoy having some kentucky bourbon with mitch mcconnell .                                  
0 0 i do n't know what his preferred drink is .                                        
1 0 so will mcconnell grab that drink with the president ?                                        
0 1 well , he tweeted this picture slash invitation over a year and a half ago .                            
0 0 look at it right there .                                                
0 0 he 's still waiting for the president to fill that bar stool .                                  
0 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 no question republicans are celebrating and for good reason .                                        
0 0 let 's just take a look at the map .                                        
0 0 31 republican governors now -- look at all that red .                                      
0 0 let 's look at senate races .                                              
0 0 they started the night at 45 , right now they have at least 53 and if they pick up louisiana in a runoff next month they will go from 45
0 0 now let 's look at the house .                                            
0 0 look at this .                                                    
0 0 a bigger republican majority in the house and just a reminder it was a lot more blue when president obama took office .              
0 0 that 's what it looks like now .                                            
0 0 so , of course republicans are in a great mood , 2014 was awesome .                              
0 0 so that means it will carry over to 2016 , right ?                                    
0 1 not so fast .                                                    
0 0 let 's take a peek at the exit polls .                                        
0 0 some sobering numbers here for republicans .                                              
0 0 first remember this .                                                    
0 0 the midterm electorate was more white , fewer african-americans and latinos -- these numbers likely to go up in a presidential year ; this number likely to go down .
0 0 also , 51 percent of women , 49 percent of men in the midterm electorate ; in a presidential year this number tends to go up to around 53 .
0 0 that helps the democrats .                                                  
0 0 also we had an older electorate this time ; this percentage likely shrinks in a presidential year .                        
0 0 and if this goes up -- you see the blue , 18 to 29 -- those voters tend to vote democratic .                
0 0 this was a good republican demographic .                                              
0 0 we 'll see what 2016 looks like .                                            
0 0 and even as voters gave republicans all these jobs , look 54 percent of the voters on tuesday have an unfavorable opinion of the republican party .      
0 0 this was not a love letter .                                              
0 0 and look at these presidential contenders .                                              
0 0 chris christie he would make a good president -- right ; 64 percent of the voters on tuesday said no .                  
0 0 how about rand paul -- 60 percent said no ; they do n't think rand paul would make a good president .                
0 0 certainly somebody would get better marks .                                              
0 0 well not rick perry -- 62 percent said the texas governor , not their choice for president , they do n't think he 'd make a good one .  
0 0 jeb bush , 59 percent said no to jeb bush .                                      
0 0 so , not a lot of love for the gop field anyway .                                  
0 0 republicans will like this number .                                                
0 0 53 percent of the voters on                                                
0 0 this big day said hillary clinton in their view would not make a good president .                            
0 0 one of those republicans i just mentioned rand paul he says forget president obama , the election results were a repudiation of her .            
1 0 she 's said to be the frontrunner for the nomination of their party so really elections are about who the leadership is in a party and it 's about either
1 0 jonathan martin , rand paul just tried to throw another punch at hillary clinton -- any truth to that ?                    
1 0 he 's been doing this for some time now trying to focus attention on hillary clinton .                          
0 0 it 's actually less about hillary clinton than it is about his own primary , i think .                        
0 0 he 's trying to sort of make himself into somebody that could be a real leader and take to it the assumed democratic standard bearer .        
0 0 but he 's going to have some real challenges first in his own primary .                              
0 0 and i think what he 's doing here is trying to sort of move the attention from that and say i 'm going to be the first guy out of
0 0 it 's not going to stop a lot of folks on the right from trying to stop him , though .                  
1 0 and nobody has stepped forward to say , ok , this is a repudiation of hillary clinton .                        
0 0 i mean on the democratic side to say here 's elizabeth warren , who has n't said ok now i will run or somebody else serious .      
0 0 so even if she has to study these exit polls and learn voters are unhappy with everybody .                        
0 0 but voters do n't like anybody .                                              
0 0 so she has to learn because she 's part of the past and she wants to be that candidate of the future .              
0 0 is it bad for her , good for her , indifferent for her ?                                
1 0 i mean it 's not great for her because it shows that the party that she , the president who she served , this is a repudiation of his policies
0 0 i think that 's what we saw on tuesday that democrats really did n't have a message in this election year .                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 you know , they ran on -- they tried to make it state by state race and a contrast between each of these candidates .          
0 0 they railed against the koch brothers .                                              
0 0 they talked about the minimum wage .                                              
0 0 but what was the overarching theme ?                                              
0 1 i think that 's what hillary is going to have to worry about come 2016 .                            
0 0 what is she running on and what does the party stand for ?                                  
0 0 pace : i do think it makes it very easy for her though to come                              
0 0 out of the gate and quickly separate herself from president obama .                                    
0 0 she 's not going to get a lot of questions from democrats about why she 's doing that .                      
0 0 this election showed he 's unpopular and if a democrat wants to win in 2016 they 're going to have to have a different message and just act differently than
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 i think that 's true .                                                
0 0 i think also one of the takeaways for this was that that old clinton magic does n't really work -- right .                
0 0 i mean part of the argument around the clinton presidency or a clinton run is that she can expand the map that perhaps she can do well with southern white
0 0 and if you look at the way the democratic brand did in these states among white voters , i mean just completely wiped out among white voters .    
0 0 so can she still make that argument that she can win in a place like kentucky ?                          
1 0 and some on the republican side who was helped the most or hurt the most by this ?                        
0 0 let 's go back to rand paul who does , as you mentioned , likes to attack hillary clinton .                    
0 0 i think to show the base -- i 'm tough , i can take on a clinton .                        
0 0 he made some friends -- the biggest question about him heading into this cycle was the establishment .                        
0 0 they thought is he too isolationist like his dad ?                                        
0 0 is he , you know , unpredictable like his dad ?                                      
0 0 he cut some ads for the chamber of commerce .                                        
0 0 he campaigned where people asked him too .                                            
0 0 he helped his senior senator mitch mcconnell win what turned out to be an easy re-election in kentucky .                      
0 0 mitch mcconnell said if rand runs on with him -- big winner here , medium winner ?                          
1 0 i think he 's a pretty big winner .                                          
1 0 but he also helped himself .                                                
1 0 he helped himself certainly especially mitch mcconnell has a huge fundraising network and that 's going to be very important for rand paul and also there are those folks ,
0 0 but he -- i do n't think he 's the only one who --                                
1 1 the question is how strong of an endorsement is this for rand paul .                                
0 0 is it a paper endorsement or is it , you know , calling up donors for rand .                        
1 0 it 's not like mcconnell has a lot of sway with the grassroots .                                
1 1 right , right .                                                    
0 1 that 's right .                                                    
0 1 that 's right , yes .                                                
1 0 the money guys .                                                    
1 0 rand paul loves that endorsement with the money guys in private .                                    
0 0 he 's not going to take mitch to iowa -- i do n't think .                              
0 0 how about this guy chris christie ?                                              
0 0 listen to him on the radio                                                
0 0 here .                                                        
0 0 we all know , you know -- some people say he 's a bully .                              
0 0 he says `` no , i 'm just new jersey .                                      
0 0 i call them like i see them . ''                                          
0 0 listen to this interview where he says , `` hey look , if people hit me enough i 'm going to hit back . ''          
1 0 you have to listen but you do n't have an obligation to be a heavy bag , you know .                    
0 0 so , you got arms and if people want to keep punching you then eventually you have to punch back .                  
1 0 i want to see this in iowa .                                            
0 0 i just want to see it .                                              
1 0 -- any just regular america outside of new jersey , this sort of blustering and yelling at folks who heckle him , it just does n't work .    
0 0 it does n't look very presidential .                                              
0 0 it does n't look very statesman like .                                            
1 0 but it does look authentic .                                                
1 0 it looks authentic .                                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
0 0 and the thing about chris christie and also i 'll put scott walker in this category after this election is now both of them through their own campaigns and with
0 0 and if you are a republican who has suffered in a blue state , you have suffered through these losses in presidential years .            
0 0 you want somebody who shows i know how to win .                                      
1 0 but can he point to success in new jersey ?                                        
0 0 i mean they have n't had a very easy time with credit downgrades .                                
0 0 so it 's a problem .                                                
1 0 just go back to being governor now and that is to be accountable for .                              
0 0 john kasich , the newly-reelected governor of ohio also somebody to keep an eye on .                            
0 0 all right , everybody sit tight .                                              
0 0 we 're not done yet .                                                
0 0 up next our great reporters share some news nuggets from their notebooks including ted cruz plans to hone his watchdog skills in 2015 .            
0 0 let 's take a trip around the inside politics table and get you out ahead of the big political stories just around the corner .          
0 0 julie pace .                                                      
1 1 well , presidents late in their second term tend to immerse themselves in foreign policy and president obama is no exception .                
0 0 less than a week after the midterms he 's headed to asia which is really going to be the first test of whether he 's weakened overseas by this election
0 0 and officials are now increasingly nervous about the reception he 's going to get in china .                          
0 0 there 's a newspaper in china that 's connected to the government that wrote a story before he left saying that the american public had downgraded the president and was
0 0 so not exactly the warm welcome they were hoping for .                                      
1 0 it just proves the old axiom all politics is global .                                      
1 0 we just finished 2014 but we 're going to be looking at 2016 and the retirement watch .                        
0 0 and this is going to have a huge impact on senator mcconnell 's ability to keep a republican majority .                    
0 0 there are a number of republican senators that we 're going to be looking at very closely on whether or not they decide to run again .      
0 0 people like richard burr of north carolina , dan coats in indiana , mark kirk in illinois -- there are several others , chuck grassley in iowa -- do they
0 0 if those open seats are there then , of course , democrats have a chance of taking those back .                    
0 0 and on the democratic side harry reid , 2016 -- everyone will be waiting for him to finally make his decision .                
1 0 i get they 're are all getting memos saying if you 're planning to run make sure you go home once in a while and make sure you live there
1 1 what are you saying -- john ?                                              
0 1 while john boehner and mitch mcconnell are having lunch with president obama on top of this new era of good feeling ted cruz is still out there and is very
0 0 i talked to him late election night on the phone and i asked him about whether or not the party should try to sort of back off the repeal of
0 0 he said emphatically not .                                                  
0 0 and in fact he said the only way to sort of keep faith with the folks that elected them was to stand by the issues they had done so .
0 0 and he said the biggest two issues for his party this cycle were a , repealing obamacare as he called ; and b , stopping the president 's illegal executive
1 0 mitch mcconnell 's new best friend .                                              
1 0 the question though is guys , how much time will he be in the senate and how much time will he be in iowa next year .      
0 0 mitch mcconnell is hoping more of the latter .                                          
1 0 that 's a great question .                                                
1 0 a lot of questions about what happens next in terms                                        
0 0 of democrats and in terms of the democratic leadership .                                        
0 0 people focusing in some ways on debbie wasserman-schultz -- does she stay on ?                                
0 0 of course , she leads the democratic national convention -- committee .                                    
0 0 it has n't always been an easy time for her .                                      
0 0 she has said she wants to serve out her term -- it ends in january of 2017 .                        
0 0 and in some ways there 's questions about whether or not she 's close enough to hillary clinton , whether she wants her to stay on .      
0 0 but it will be interesting to see whether or not she 's able to stick it out or move on .                  
1 0 i think not .                                                    
0 0 some people survive --                                                    
1 1 right -- yes .                                                    
1 0 -- survive and surprise and do it .                                            
0 0 but there 's a lot of heat on her and a lot of people in the party because they did n't well .              
0 0 i do n't think she 's going to find her base .                                    
0 0 i 'll close with this .                                                
0 0 put one in the -- i 'll call it take nothing for granted file .                              
0 0 the republicans have one more race they need to win and that 's louisiana in runoff -- it 's december 6 .                
0 0 bill cassidy is the republican .                                                
0 0 exit polls show he 's a huge favorite over mary landrieu , the democratic incumbent but to take nothing for granted , the republican national committee is sending 350 staffers
0 0 that 's 350 staffers .                                                  
0 0 they 're all finished with the other campaigns so why not .                                    
0 0 send them down louisiana .                                                  
0 0 the food is good .                                                  
0 0 democrats say they will beef up their ground game but we 've seen some indications some democrats are going to pull their money out of that race because they think
0 0 landrieu faces one other big question .                                              
0 0 here only chance of winning is ginning up gigantic african-american turn out .                                  
0 0 will she defy the trend of this year and invite the president down ?                                
0 0 do n't bet on it .                                                
0 0 that 's it for inside politics .

0 0 i 'm lisa sylvester .                                                  
0 0 we begin with supreme court nominee john roberts under the microscope and the subject of partisan bickering .                        
0 0 even as roberts continues to make the rounds on the hill , republicans and democrats remain at odds over the start-date for confirmation hearings and whether the administration has made
0 0 documents that have been released are shedding some additional light on roberts ' views and how he might rule on the high court .            
0 0 here 's our white house correspondent , suzanne malveaux .                                        
1 0 on john roberts ' first day at the justice department in the summer of 1981 , the 26-year-old lawyer was assigned to prepare sandra day o'connor for her supreme court
0 0 roberts , who would be poised to succeed o'connor on the high court nearly a quarter century later , advised her quote , `` avoid giving specific responses to any
0 0 on judicial activism , documents show roberts discouraged it supporting republican legislation instead that would limit the supreme court 's jurisdiction over abortion , busing and school prayer .  
0 0 on affirmative action , roberts rejected a positive report about the program by the u.s. commission on civil rights , saying , `` there is no recognition of the obvious
0 0 the affirmative action program required the recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates . ''                                  
0 0 on school desegregation , roberts questioned the efficacy of bussing in a draft letter for the attorney general , saying , `` we do not believe bussing is necessary to
0 0 and on sex discrimination , roberts advocated limits to the law affecting gender equality for college sports .                        
0 0 so , lisa , of course the big question is : what does this really say about roberts ' thinking ?                  
0 0 does it really give us a window into his thinking ?                                      
0 0 well , of course , some legal scholars are saying : perhaps very little .                              
0 0 they say when you look at the formal drafts in the letters , it reflects the administration 's ideas , but if you look at the handwritten notes , perhaps
0 0 democrats are arguing however , they want recent records , most importantly , that at his time at the solicitor general 's office -- lisa ?        
1 1 suzanne malveaux at the white house .                                              
0 0 thank you very much for that report .                                            
0 0 in the lead-up to roberts ' confirmation hearings the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee is trying to keep the pressure on republicans .          
0 1 senator patrick leahy is leading the charge against chairman arlen specter 's proposal to begin hearings at the end of august , in part because he wants adequate time to
0 0 on the senate floor today , leahy urged the white house to release documents from roberts ' work from the first bush administration , in addition to thousands of pages
0 0 begin video clip )                                                    
1 0 the white house is eager to supply documents it selected and certainly provided it with great fanfare .                        
0 0 but we have yet to receive the documents that we have in fact requested .                              
0 0 it 's an unfortunate pattern we 've see too often .                                      
1 0 public opinion seems to be on john roberts ' side .                                      
0 0 a new quinnipiac poll shows 44 percent of americans approve of roberts ' nomination .                              
0 0 about one-fourth disapprove .                                                    
0 0 a little more than a fourth are unsure .                                          
0 0 forty percent of those surveyed say roberts would make the supreme court more conservative , compared to five percent who think he 'd make the court more liberal .  
0 0 twenty-nine percent predict no change .                                                
0 0 and 53 percent say public opinion of roberts ' nomination should have a great deal of influence on whether he 's confirmed , but only six percent believe it will
0 0 unlike john roberts , you do n't see president bush on capitol hill every day , but he was there today .                
0 0 evidence that a trade agreement he 's promoting is facing a tough fight in congress .                            
0 0 our congressional correspondent , ed henry , has more on the pact and showdown vote that could come as soon as tonight .              
1 0 with key initiatives like social security reform stalled , president bush made a rare visit to capitol hill to rally his own party behind a struggling trade pact .  
0 0 republicans emerged fired-up , insisting the free trade deal with help the united states by shoring up emerging democracies in central america .              
1 0 why in the world should people stick to the path of democracy if supposedly the richest , most generous democracy in the world rejects a trade agreement with these countries
1 0 but democrats shot back : the deal is bad for america and will lead to more lost of manufacturing jobs .                  
1 0 the american people will know in a very clear way the difference between how the democrats are fighting for them and how the republicans are ignoring their aspirations .  
1 0 republican leaders counter the pact will create jobs and guaranteed victory .                                    
1 0 it will be a tough vote , but we will pass cafta tonight .                                
0 0 we will honor our commitments to our neighbors to the south .                                    
0 0 we will protect our national security and we will do it all with very few democrats .                          
1 0 but the president is facing major defections in his own ranks , so the republican leadership has resorted to wheeling and dealing on the highway bill , promising lawmakers roads
0 0 but that has not swayed republican opponents worried it will decimate the textile and sugar industries .                          
1 0 if we do n't protect the jobs in america one day , the flags that cover the coffins of the brave who die for this country , the flags that
0 0 let 's save america and god help us save america and let 's do what is right and kill this enemy that 's called cafta .        
1 0 the wheeling and dealing will continue into the wee small hours .                                    
0 0 we 're not expecting a vote until at least midnight and it 's not just the president who is twisting arms .                
0 0 secretary of state condoleezza rice was just spotted in the capitol lobbying , wavering republicans right down to the final hours here .              
0 0 it gives you an idea of just how high the political stakes are for this white house -- lisa ?                    
1 1 and it certainly sounds like it 's going to be a long night there .                              
0 0 now , with the president on the hill , did lawmakers bring up the subject of a troop pull-out from iraq ?                
1 0 well , we did n't here about it coming up in the actual meeting , but it 's interesting some pressure is coming from more republicans .      
0 0 remember , this resolution that was authored a couple months back republican walter jones , saying the president needs to come up with a timetable next year to start bringing
1 0 republican jim leech , a veteran of the international relations committee , did not appear at the initial press conference for this , but we 're told he has signed
1 0 all right .                                                      
0 0 thank you very much .                                                  
0 0 ed henry from capitol hill and of course , we will have mr. jones on our show later in this broadcast .                
1 0 would cafta hurt worker security ?                                                
0 0 would it help national security ?                                                
0 0 two congressman will debate those questions ahead .                                            
1 0 the drive to pass an emergency bill compromise .                                          
0 0 will it do anything to lower gas prices ?                                          
0 0 we 'll tell you what 's in the measure and what 's not .                                
1 0 where will his new path lead him ?                                            
1 0 as the massive and long-awaited energy bill nears a final vote in congress , details of the multibillion-dollar legislation are beginning to emerge .            
0 0 our bruce morton takes a look at the fine print .                                      
1 0 the bill gives energy industries $ 11.5 billion in subsidies for oil , gas , coal , even nuclear power .                  
0 0 but what will it do ?                                                
0 0 the u.s. now imports 58 percent of the oil it uses .                                    
0 0 federal officials project that will be 68 percent by 2025 , and analysts say this bill wo n't change that much .                
0 0 will it lower gas prices ?                                                
0 0 even the chairman of the house energy committee says that might take a year , and he 's one of the optimists .              
1 0 mandates an inventory of current offshore oil and gas reserves , even in areas now off-limits like california and florida .                  
0 0 it gives the federal government the exclusive right to approve construction of liquefied national gas facilities , even if governors or local officials object .          
0 0 it does n't mention drilling the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska , but that 's been approved in other bills and final approval is likely in september .  
0 0 it delays for at least 141 days a u.s. government review of china 's bid to purchase unocal .                      
0 0 it does not protect the manufacturers of gasoline additive mtbe as suspected carcinogen from lawsuits .                            
0 0 it does not require increased fuel efficiency in u.s. cars and trucks .                                  
0 0 conferees defeated a proposal to require that 10 percent of u.s. electricity come from renewable sources , wind , solar power and so on , by 2020 , and a
0 0 one democratic critic called it a scrapple full of pork many democrats will like , and passage is expected this week .                
0 0 and then ...                                                      
1 1 i think it 's important for the republicans to be able to say they 've done something , they 've addressed energy finally .            
0 0 but the devil is always in the details and if six months or a year from now people do n't see lower energy prices or hear that there is more
1 0 the bill does one other thing : it expands daylight saving time , starting it earlier , second sunday in march instead of the first sunday in april , and
0 0 this is very important to a powerful lobby , america 's children .                                  
0 0 what it means , kids , is a longer halloween .                                      
0 0 trick or treat !                                                    
0 1 bruce morton , cnn , washington .                                              
1 1 new york governor george pataki makes big decision , but another one still looms in our wednesday political bytes .                    
0 0 pataki said today he will not run for a fourth term as governor next year .                            
0 0 recent polls have shown him trailing state attorney general and probable democratic candidate eliot spitzer .                            
0 0 and while pataki has decided to leave albany , he has been mentioned as a possible white house hopeful in 2008 .                
0 0 today pataki offered only a slight hint about his future plans .                                    
1 0 in a year and a half , i will be able to leave this office confident in the future of our great state , because i believe in you .
0 0 in the meantime , we 're going to keep this state moving forward , and come 2007 , i will follow a new path , find new challenges , knowing
1 0 former democratic running mates john kerry and john edwards are both expected in new hampshire on friday .                        
0 0 kerry will attend a thank you reception for his new hampshire supporters in last year 's campaign .                        
0 0 edwards will attend a manchester fundraiser for his former new hampshire state chairman .                                
0 0 and in the battle for campaign cash , republican john mccain has reportedly taken steps to get his political action committee back up and running .        
0 0 `` political moneyline '' reports that straight talk america registered as a federal pact earlier this month .                        
0 0 just ahead , is free trade the solution or part of the problem ?                                
0 0 as the white house takes up the central american free trade agreement , i 'll talk with two congressman from the same party , but with very different views .
0 0 as we have reported , president bush was on capitol hill this morning to rally support for the central american free trade agreement .            
0 0 and with me now to talk about cafta , as it 's known , are two republicans on opposite sides of the issue .            
0 0 congressman clay shaw of florida supports the trade deal .                                        
0 0 congressman walter jones of north carolina opposes the agreement .                                        
0 0 our first question for you , representative shaw .                                          
0 0 as we just mentioned , president bush was on the hill talking about cafta and house majority leader tom delay is predicting a win tonight .        
0 0 how do you get there , though , from where -- if you only have six to 12 democrats , a handful of democrats voting for it and a number
1 0 well , there 's a lot of democrats that are kind of hiding their vote at this time , so hopefully we 'll grow that total .      
0 0 and hopefully we 'll get some of our good friends like walter here to take another look at the issue .                  
0 0 it 's a win-win for america .                                              
0 0 and it 's simply imposing fair trade where right now there 's one-way free trade coming into the united states .                  
0 0 we want to level the playing field and have a fair trade and get those tariff barriers down going into central america .              
0 0 so it 's good for america , and i think the president made a very good -- a very good pitch this morning .            
0 0 and it was very passionate pitch , as i 'm sure my friend walter here will agree .                        
1 0 representative jones , do you agree ?                                              
0 0 do you think they actually do have the votes to pass cafta ?                                  
0 0 that there are some hidden democratic votes out there ?                                        
1 1 well , clay shaw is one of my dearest friends and a man i have great respect for .                      
0 0 we feel pretty confident right now -- obviously at 3:40 in the afternoon or 3:50 , this could change tonight by 7:00 or 8:00 .          
0 0 we think we have at least 25 to 28 hard no votes on the republican side .                          
0 0 the democrats are telling me that they only feel like they will lose between eight and 10 .                        
0 0 if those numbers hold true , then we think we 're in great shape , defeating this cafta , going back to the negotiating table .        
1 0 representative shaw , you know , i 've heard the argument -- in fact , you just described the argument that 's been made repeatedly , that cafta will level
0 0 but if you look at nafta , those exact same arguments were made then and instead what we 've seen are tens-of-thousands of jobs -- american jobs that have been
0 0 the trade deficit has ballooned .                                                
0 0 why would anyone expect that cafta would be different ?                                        
1 0 well , do n't lose sight of the fact right now the tariff barriers coming into the united states are already down .              
0 0 plus , central america is not that large a piece of the trading situation .                              
0 0 i think like 13 percent of our exports go into central america .                                  
0 0 so , it 's not that huge , but i think this goes beyond just simply trade .                        
0 0 i was here during the reagan administration and at that time , we had terrible problems down in central america .                  
0 0 we had -- the communists were running half the show down there .                                  
0 0 we had dictatorships .                                                    
0 0 we had revolutions .                                                    
0 0 now they 've settled down .                                                
0 0 they 're looking north to us .                                              
0 0 they all have democracies , even though they have a lot of poverty down there , still , which this bill would certainly address , they still -- i think
0 0 and the future of central america and being pro-american , that is united states american , is very important to our national security .            
0 0 so , this thing has legs that are much longer than just simple trade .                              
1 0 lisa , could i speak to that ?                                            
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 i was just going to ask you to weigh in , representative jones .                                
0 0 i 'm sure you have some comments on this .                                        
1 0 well , let me share with you -- i have a letter signed by seven elected officials from honduras , guatemala , el salvador , nicaragua and just one sentence
0 0 it was written to all members of congress , by the way and it says , `` cafta will only lead to more social instability in the region as more
0 0 they 're asking us to vote against this .                                          
0 0 go back to the negotiating table and do what is right for the central american workers and also the american workers .                
0 0 in my state of north carolina , since nafta , we lost over 200,000 jobs and in this country alone , we lost 2.5 million jobs .      
1 0 congressman shaw , the administration has made it very clear that this is a top priority .                          
0 0 and it has n't been shy at all about asking representatives : what will it take to sweeten the pot ?                  
0 0 what will it take to secure their vote , even though as we just heard , there have been thousands of -- tens-of-thousands , in fact , of jobs lost
0 0 it puts representative in quite the quandary .                                            
0 0 now , why not just try to pass cafta on its own merits ?                                
1 1 well , first of all i would dispute the figures as to the loss of jobs .                          
0 0 that is a bogus argument .                                                
0 0 even though there are some jobs that have gone to mexico , i think that as far as the economy of the united states , nafta has not been a
0 0 but just look at it this way , you 've got right now , about american apparel , up to 23 percent tariff on goods going from the united states
0 0 plastics , rubber , i can go right down the line and talk about the tremendous amount of tariffs that the united states manufactures are having to cope with in
0 0 agriculture -- this thing is huge .                                              
0 0 you mentioned the poor farmers -- or my friend here , mr. jones , mentioned the poor farmers .                      
0 0 obviously there 's always some people that are going to be alarmed by free trade .                            
0 0 they 're no longer going to be protected by a lot of tariffs .                                
0 0 but the majority of the people in central america will certainly profit by this .                              
0 0 the trade preferences to central america go away at the end of 2006 and at that point , also , perhaps the cut-and- show sew shops , the investment and
0 0 it will go to china .                                                
1 0 well , i 've got -- let me just interrupt you there for a moment .                            
0 0 congressman jones , i want you to comment , because we 're running out of time .                          
0 0 but first , quickly , on the jobs issue , because it sounded like you wanted to say something and then your thoughts on the pentagon announcing that it wants
1 1 well , i -- the only thing i want to say to my friend , mr. shaw , is my numbers about north carolina and the effect of nafta are
1 0 congressmen , thank you very much for joining us and we 'll have to see how this debate shapes up tonight on cafta .            
0 0 i know it 's going to be a long night for everyone .                                  
1 0 and i might add that these countries that we 're talking about have been supporting us in iraq and that 's important .              
1 0 all right .

1 0 will this former surfer ride in a mayor 's office that has been under a wave of controversy ?

0 0 and now back to inside politics and a must-read for many senators and journalists , those reams of documents from john roberts ' legal work for the reagan administration .
0 0 our senior political analyst , bill schneider , has been going over the supreme court nominee 's records , looking for clues about the kind of justice he 'd be
1 0 if you had doubts about whether john roberts , the president 's supreme court nominee , is a committed conservative , the documents just released should dispel them .  
0 0 there are more than 15,000 pages from 1981 and '82 , when roberts served as special assistant to william french smith , president reagan 's first attorney general .  
0 0 they paint a picture of an eager , self-confident food soldier in the reagan revolution .                            
0 0 roberts was candid , even fearless , with his superiors , nothing wishy-washy about this young man .                        
0 0 in 1981 , roberts was asked to review a report on affirmative action by the outgoing chairman of the civil rights commission .              
0 0 roberts dismissed the chairman 's argument that failures in affirmative action were caused by sabotage .                            
0 0 `` there is no recognition of the obvious reason for failure , '' roberts wrote .                            
0 0 `` the affirmative action program required the recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates . ''                                
0 0 in 1982 , roberts disagreed with the position taken by assistant attorney general ted olson .                            
0 0 olson believed legislation pending in congress to limit the supreme court 's jurisdiction over abortion , busing and school prayer cases raised constitutional problems .          
0 0 roberts wrote in the margin of olson 's memo , `` real courage would be to read the constitution as it should be read and not kowtow to the tribes
1 0 `` it really should not matter what the personal ideology of our appointees may be , so long as they recognize that their ideology should have no role in the
1 0 there 's no role for advocacy with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge .                    
1 0 but , unlike the appeals court , the supreme court can set precedent .                                
0 0 roberts spent his very first day at the justice department helping coach supreme court nominee sandra day o'connor for her confirmation hearings .              
0 0 now he 's been nominated to succeed o'connor on the court .                                    
0 0 how is that for a historical footnote ?                                            
1 0 everything seems to go full circle , does n't it , bill ?                                  
1 0 it certainly does .                                                    
1 0 all right , thank you very much , bill schneider .                                      
0 0 well , many senators are poring over roberts ' history and making early assessments whether he 's likely to get their confirmation vote .            
0 0 today , patrick leahy set a benchmark for rejecting roberts ' nomination .                                  
0 0 in an interview with vermont public radio , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee was asked if he would vote for roberts if it appeared he would pursue an
0 0 and the senator responded , `` no , i would n't . ''                                  
0 0 now let 's talk to another democrat about roberts ' prospects and the current flap over releasing his records .                    
0 0 senator ben nelson of nebraska is an influential figure in the confirmation process as a leader of the so-called gang of 14 moderates who averted an earlier battle over judicial
0 0 now , i understand that you have been , said that you are leaning toward voting for roberts for confirming him .                
0 0 is that correct ?                                                    
1 1 well , what i said is , i see nothing in the process to date that would cause me not to vote for him .          
0 0 the process is continuing , of course .                                            
1 0 well , we have seen at least 15,000 new pages on roberts released in the last day .                        
0 0 was there anything in there that gives you pause , anything that makes you think that he will face more opposition in the senate than previously thought ?    
1 1 well , i do n't know , but i doubt it .                                    
0 0 i say that because i do n't think that it should be about his judicial -- it should n't be about his political philosophy .          
0 0 it should be about his judicial philosophy .                                            
0 0 in other words , is he in -- is he content to be an adjudicator and does n't want to be a legislator making law ?        
0 0 to me , that is the issue about judge roberts , not that i prejudge that , thinking that he wants to be an activist judge .      
0 0 but i want to be sure that he does n't plan to be and would n't become an activist judge .                  
0 0 that 's what i think we ought to be looking at .                                    
0 0 political philosophy is interesting , but judicial philosophy is essential .                                      
1 0 on that note , speaking of judicial philosophy , a number of senators believe they have to have the documents , all of the documents .        
0 0 in fact , another document fight is brewing over roberts ' tax records .                                
0 0 will the irs -- i understand the irs will provide a one- page summary .                              
0 0 but the bush administration is refusing to release his complete annual tax forms .                                
0 0 why is it necessary to have these tax records ?                                        
1 1 well , i do n't know .                                              
0 0 i assume that there are those who want to take a look to make sure that everything is in order .                  
0 0 this is a lifetime appointment .                                                
0 0 i have n't weighed in on the docu-drama that 's going on right now , quite honestly .                        
0 0 i think the committee ought not to ask for anything it should n't and i think the white house , the administration , ought to provide everything that it should
0 0 but they ought to be able to work that out .                                      
0 1 if there is some probative value , some particular level of interest because of -- it bears on his judicial abilities , then i think they 're entitled to it
0 0 but just to pore over documents because they 're there i do n't think helps anybody and it is n't going to make a difference in whether this person will
1 0 in terms of the timeline , senator specter has said that he wants to start the hearings august 29 , as early as august 29 , to bring back senators
0 0 that would give democrats more than a month to review .                                      
0 0 is that a sufficient time ?                                                
0 0 i know some democrats are trying to drag this out and they are insisting on a later date .                      
0 0 do you agree with them ?                                                
1 1 well , i do n't know , because i 'm not a member of the judiciary committee .                        
0 0 and -- and the nomination is properly before the judiciary committee right now .                                
0 0 and they ought to make that decision .                                            
0 0 but , once again , i do n't think anybody ought to be interested in dragging this out .                      
0 0 but i do think that a thorough review of the -- of the appropriate documents is in order .                      
0 0 that 's what the hearing process is all about .                                        
0 0 so , i certainly support their effort to get the documents .                                    
0 0 i support their effort to get the right amount of time .                                    
0 0 and , at this point , i leave that up to them to decide in both cases .                        
1 1 well , let me just switch gears really quickly here .                                      
0 0 the pentagon is now talking about a true pullout as early next spring or summer .                            
0 0 how does the u.s. achieve this , though , given the situation that the iraqi police forces are not quite -- they 're not even really close to standing on
1 0 well , i think it 's going to be very difficult to pull out any significant number of our troops or of the coalition troops until there 's a general
0 0 but i -- i would like to know more about what the percentage of their capability is .                        
0 0 are they 50 percent capable of their self- defense ?                                        
0 0 are they now about 50 percent capable of their self- government , with a constitution hopefully about to be finalized ?                  
0 0 that 's -- those are the questions that i 've got .                                    
0 0 what percentage of capability do they have ?                                            
0 0 if we can answer that , then i think we can begin to decide about the drawdown .                        
1 0 important questions .                                                      
0 0 all right , thank you very much , senator ben nelson .                                    
1 0 thank you .                                                      
1 0 and we 'll get a republican take on roberts and how the confirmation process is playing out .                        
0 0 up next , i 'll talk with senate judiciary committee chair -- member lindsey graham .                            
0 1 also head , have san diego voters shut the revolving door at the mayor 's office ?                          
0 0 the results are in .                                                  
0 0 and when we go `` inside the blogs , '' can a missing person be found online ?                        
0 0 now a republican in the thick of the process of confirming or rejecting supreme court nominee john roberts .                      
0 0 we 're joined by senator lindsey graham of south carolina , a member of the judiciary committee .                        
0 1 thank you very much for joining us today .                                          
0 0 we certainly appreciate that .                                                  
1 1 yes , ma'am .                                                    
1 0 well , when roberts was advising sandra -- sandra day o'connor , as we have heard , that he was advising her on her confirmation hearings , he said that
0 0 but if the majority of americans , 61 percent , in fact , according to a cnn/ '' usa today '' /gallup poll , think they have a right to
1 1 no .                                                        
0 0 who wants a judge that has decided how the case is going to be determined before they hear it ?                    
0 0 one hundred percent of americans should want a judge not to make up their mind before they hear the facts .                  
0 0 and i just disagree with the poll .                                            
0 0 if we start making judges tell us in judiciary hearings how they 're going to rule on abortion , same-sex marriage , guns , you name it , then they
0 0 courts are for individual rights .                                                
0 0 polling is for politics .                                                  
0 0 and we do n't want to take polling into the courtroom .                                    
1 0 well , let me just press you a little bit on that , which is , how are we to know his philosophy , we meaning how are americans supposed
1 0 the way he 's conducted himself in every job he 's had .                                  
0 0 what do other lawyers who have worked with him think of him ?                                  
0 0 has he been a lawyer that cuts corners , that tries to be overly active ?                            
0 0 he 's been a judge for two years .                                          
0 0 has he used the robe to become a legislator ?                                        
0 0 what do people think of him who have served with him as a judge , who have worked with him as a lawyer ?            
0 0 is there anything in his background to make you believe that he would take his own personal opinions , put on a robe and enact a personal agenda vs. following
0 0 i think , when you look at those qualities and that standard , you 'll find a guy that 's very modest in terms of judicial philosophy .    
0 0 he 's well respected and will not let a personal agenda get in the way of being a judge in a case that may involve you or me .  
1 0 well , we 're learning more about roberts from documents released from the early 1980s .                            
0 0 an example is , he spoke out against a u.s. commission on civil rights report , advised the attorney general on how to tactfully refuse a funding request for an
0 0 are these concerns ?                                                    
0 0 do you think that these will be roadblocks to his confirmation ?                                    
1 1 if we start holding the advice a lawyer gives to their client against the lawyer in a privileged setting , then we 're going to destroy the law .  
0 0 two things should not happen here .                                              
0 0 we should not hold the fact that -- against judge roberts who he represented or any legal advice he gave at the request of a client or at the request
0 0 i 've represented rapists , murders .                                              
0 0 you name it , i 've represented them as a defense attorney in the air force and i 've prosecuted him .                
0 0 you should n't hold it against me the thoughts of my client .                                  
0 0 you should not hold it against judge roberts for any legal advice he gave someone seeking legal advice , because that was his job .          
0 0 you should judge him on his abilities as a lawyer , his qualifications , his judicial temperament , because , if we start doing that , people are not going
1 0 and , on that note , attorney general alberto gonzales said the legal right to abortion was settled for lower courts , but not the supreme court .    
0 0 was this in essence a message to the senate that roberts wo n't be bound by his past statements that the 1973 roe vs. wade decision essentially settled this issue
1 0 if you 're a lower court , you 're bound by the precedent of the supreme court .                        
0 0 if you 're a member of the supreme court , you and your colleagues can revisit any area of the law .                
0 0 but to overturn a well-settled area of the law , you 've got to find something new .                        
0 0 there 's a pretty strict standard for that .                                          
0 0 the idea of having him tell us whether he will affirm or reject a particular case is out of bounds , inappropriate .              
0 0 we 're looking at his abilities , his qualifications , not a commitment or a bargain to make to get on the court .            
0 0 it 's not about our pet peeves as senators .                                        
0 0 it 's about his qualification as a person and as a judge .                                  
0 0 so , i do n't think anybody 's going to get him to answer that question how you 'd rule on roe v. wade in the future , just like
0 0 she was n't going to bind herself and disqualify herself before she ever got the job .                          
1 1 let me turn here to another issue .                                            
0 1 we only have about 30 seconds or so .                                          
1 1 yes , ma'am .                                                    
1 0 defense secretary rumsfeld made a surprise visit to baghdad , urging the iraqis to finish their draft constitution before the august 15 deadline .            
0 0 and general george casey said that the u.s. is hopeful that it can bring back a substantial number of troops next spring , summer .          
0 0 how realistic , though , is this , given the situation on the ground ?                              
0 0 some people are even referring that the situation could tip into a civil war .                              
1 0 well , the constitutional process is moving forward .                                          
0 0 if we get it drafted in august and confirmed in october , it would be historic .                          
0 0 it took us 11 years .                                                
0 0 if they need six more months , so be it .                                      
0 0 but the idea of coming home too early is off the table .                                  
0 0 i hope we can bring troops home next spring .                                        
0 0 but the constitutional process is difficult in america .                                          
0 0 it 's difficult in iraq .                                                
0 0 taking a 1,400- year-old religious dispute and solving that problem between now and october is tough .                          
0 0 but progress is being made .                                                
0 0 there 's all -- every reason to be hopeful that the iraqis are coming together to draft a constitution they can live under .            
1 0 senator lindsey graham , thank you very much for joining us .                                    
0 0 graham : thank you .                                                  
0 0 we appreciate it .                                                    
0 1 well , we turn our focus outside of washington in the second edition of `` political bytes . ''

0 1 well , there is plenty of information to talk about as the nuggets keep trickling out with regard to the valerie plame investigation .            
0 0 a `` washington post '' article today now says that special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald 's net of people he was going to talk about is much wider than initially thought
0 0 the left side of the blogosphere taking a very hard look at this today .                              
0 0 hullabaloo , this is digbysblog.blogspot.com , pleasantly surprised to read about this new information , not sure what 's going to come up of it , everybody a little skeptical
0 0 the leftcoaster.com saying exactly the same thing , that , if you come away from this article without seeing that the agency is about to get revenge , then you
0 0 so , valerie plame out , more cia-white house in right now .                                  
1 0 two other smaller stories are getting a little bit of attention on the left and on the right today involving this larger news story .          
0 0 both involve money .                                                    
0 0 valerie plame gave some away , and karl rove might be getting some more .                              
0 0 at the stakeholder -- this is the blog of the democratic congressional campaign committee -- they 're looking at a pay raise that karl rove is getting , along with
0 0 in the comment section there , someone says , well , he 's going to have massive legal bills .                    
0 0 so he probably needs it .

0 0 valerie plame , it 's reported in `` the new york post , '' gave away $ 372 as a campaign contribution to a progressive group last year , america
0 0 the right has been very interested in the political persuasion of joseph wilson and his wife .                          
0 0 over at `` the washington monthly , '' again on the left , kevin drumm is looking into what he thinks is a wider republican p.r .      
0 0 strategy on the karl rove affair , on the valerie plame affair .                                  
0 0 what he 's looking into is -- what they 're trying to do is , in his words , diminish the seriousness of outing a cia agent .    
0 0 he 's pointing to senator pat roberts , who wants to look into covert status and what he says is , roberts is preemptively defending rove on this one ,
1 0 and the back and forth that often happens on the blogs , pejman yousefzadeh at pejmanesque.com says he 's surprised that kevin drumm can read minds , because drumm is
0 0 pejman is a republican .

0 0 the president and vice president head to the hill .                                        
0 0 it 's part of their strategy for dealing with congress/ and the defense secretary heads to iraq as a top american general says improving conditions could bring good news for
0 0 but first today , john roberts met with more senators , including republican olympia snow of maine .                        
0 0 and the national archives released thousands of justice department papers from the time roberts was a special assistant to the attorney general .              
0 0 included are roberts ' arguments on affirmative action and his 1981 advice to then supreme court nominee sandra day o'connor .                  
0 0 but first , i just want to say , a point of clarification .                                
0 0 which is , earlier i mentioned that with the irs documents that the irs is willing to release a one-page summary of roberts ' records .        
0 0 and i said that the white house had refused to .                                      
0 0 what the white house is telling us is that they just have n't been asked for those records yet .                    
0 0 now it gets us into this whole big debate with the records , 15,000 documents .                            
0 0 the white house has been essentially been very forthcoming in terms of offering documents .                              
0 0 and what do you say ?                                                
0 0 do you think it 's a good strategy there .                                        
1 0 it 's a very good strategy .                                              
0 0 the idea , of course , is to get this nominee confirmed and confirmed in time for the october 3 session .                
0 0 there 's no argument here .                                                
0 0 the whole idea is to lay stuff out on the table for everybody to see it .                          
0 0 and for the most part , from a strategic standpoint , democrats initially had a strategy , at least in early july , of trying to attack whoever the nominee
0 0 two , that the nominee would be somebody who was an extremist .                                  
0 0 and three , that they would not fork over the documents necessary for the senate to really know who this person was .              
0 0 and i think all those things have been satisfied .                                        
1 1 well , they 're essentially taking away some of their punch .                                    
0 0 do you agree with that , paul ?                                            
1 1 yeah .                                                        
0 1 very smart .                                                      
0 0 they 've tried to kill the democrats with kindness .                                        
0 0 they 've cooperated them to death over the prenominee period .                                      
0 0 the president consulted far more than the constitution requires , very smart , very good for him .                        
0 0 they 're releasing as you said 15,000 documents .                                          
0 0 they 're drawing a line , though , there 's a lot of documents they wo n't release .                      
0 0 they 're going to argue that those are documents from when mr. roberts was deputy solicitor general .                        
0 0 and was giving legal advice to the president .                                          
0 0 i have to say i think they 're right about that .                                    
0 0 i worked for the president .                                                
0 0 i think a president ought to have the right to confidential communications with his staff , something that ken starr and others did n't want president clinton to have ,
0 0 and the right should have belonged to president clinton , it ought to belong to president bush .                        
0 0 but it makes it all the more glaring that they wo n't release his tax returns .                          
0 0 they have to .                                                    
0 0 as a political matter .                                                  
0 0 not as a legal matter .                                                
0 0 candidates for senate , for congress , for dog catcher routinely release tax their returns .                            
0 0 and judge roberts has to , as well .                                          
    he just has to as a political matter so we know , is there any financial conflict of interest or are there any other issues that they raise .  
    and they 're going to have to do it .                                        
    save this tape .

    candidates for senate , for congress , for dog catcher routinely release tax their returns .

0 0 he 's going to have to release his tax returns .                                      
0 0 well , you know what they 're saying on that , and that 's in fact the point i was just clarifying .              
0 0 if you come out and you say the white house is refusing to release these tax records , the white house comes back , you know they call us up
0 0 they just have n't asked us .                                              
0 0 is this part of the whole political process ?                                          
1 0 i mean , are we splitting hairs here ?                                          
0 0 what do you think ?                                                  
0 0 well , i think that maybe some folks on the other side are looking for something to attack and there really is n't a lot to attack here .  
0 0 this is a person who happens to be liked , well liked on both sides of the aisle .                      
1 0 he 's worked with people on both sides of the aisle .                                    
0 0 he really -- and no matter what you say about his political beliefs , whatever they may have within in the past , you have to look at his temperament
0 0 one of the conservatives argument on the supreme court is we should listen to the intent of the founding fathers .                  
0 0 well , the founding fathers were clear about this .                                        
0 0 thomas jefferson said when a person accepts a public trust , he becomes public property , meaning you have to disclose everything , and especially on finances .    
0 0 i do n't want to see medical records , or what videos he rents .                              
1 0 that 's too yucky for me .                                              
0 0 but his finances , the american people have a right to know .                                  
0 0 let me just jump in really quickly , because i want to read a quote here .                          
0 0 this is a memo that was released back from when roberts was in the department of justice back in 1981 .                  
0 0 quote , `` the approach was to avoid giving specific responses to any direct questions on legal issues likely to come up before the court , but demonstrating in the
0 0 basically , talk as if you know the subject but do n't give anything away .                            
1 0 smart strategy or not .                                                  
0 0 what do you say , paul ?                                              
0 0 bad strategy i think .                                                  
0 0 i think they should just tell the truth .                                          
0 0 i think telling the truth is the best thing .                                        
0 0 when ruth bader ginsberg was nominated by president clinton to the supreme court in 1993 , she was asked by senator brown , then a senator from colorado , about
0 0 she did n't say gee , it might come before me .                                    
0 0 of course it 's going to come before her .                                        
0 0 she did n't talk about a case particular .                                          
0 0 but she said if a woman does n't have a right to have an abortion , she 's not a fully adult human being .          
0 0 that 's what she said .                                                
0 0 now , that 's a pretty -- in some people 's eyes , extreme , certainly committed principal position on abortion .                
0 0 she was still confirmed nearly unanimously .                                              
0 0 judge roberts should say the truth .                                              
0 0 he thinks abortion is not a constitutional right .                                          
0 0 and roe versus wade was wrongly decided .                                            
0 0 that 's an honorable position .                                                
0 0 members of the judiciary committee in the senate have that position .                                    
1 0 he should just tell you the truth .                                            
0 0 but i bet you a nickel he wo n't .                                        
0 0 you 're eating into joe 's time right now .                                        
1 0 we have just a few minutes left .                                            
0 0 i want to get your insight .                                              
0 0 well , the question becomes whether or not you want an activist judge on the court .                          
0 0 and this president has said he did n't want an activist .                                    
0 0 he wants somebody who 's going to fairly and rightly interpret the constitution of the united states .                        
0 0 and how can you say what you 're going to do on a given case , especially one that has n't yet come up before you ?      
0 0 i think that judge roberts is doing the right thing .                                      
1 1 he advised justice o'connor rightly .                                                
0 0 and i think he 's going to do the right thing himself when he 's questioned .                          
0 0 ok. joe and paul stay right there .                                            
0 0 we 're going to get back to you in a minute on another topic .                              
0 0 well , the president headed to the other end of pennsylvania avenue today .                                
0 0 coming up when the `` strategy session '' continues , president bush 's personal appeals to members of congress .                    
0 0 what 's behind his on-site visit .                                              
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics .                                        
0 0 still here , paul begala and joe watkins .                                          
0 0 president bush , along with vice president cheney headed to capitol hill this morning to meet with house republicans .                    
1 0 and part of the visit was to push for cafta , a free trade agreement with central american nations up for a vote in the house .      
0 0 the face-to-face approach brought very different reactions from the top republican and democrat on the ways and means committee .                    
0 0 this is not a major trade vote .                                            
0 0 it is a major political vote .                                              
1 0 it 's been made a major political vote by the democrats , because they believe there 's an opportunity to blunt the thrust of the republican majority and the republican
0 0 it is not about trade .                                                
0 0 why the president believes that he has to have this win , and the way he 's doing it and the heavy-handed way he 's carrying this , i do
0 0 is it the way the war 's going ?                                          
0 0 is it karl rove ?                                                  
0 0 is it social security ?                                                  
1 0 is it his ratings ?                                                  
0 0 i have no clue .                                                  
1 0 well , there you heard that .                                              
0 0 do you agree with what bill thomas is saying , that this is basically a political punch at the president and not about the principals of cafta ?    
0 0 i agree with both of them .                                              
0 0 i agree that -- that bill thomas is right , this is going to be a major political issue .                    
0 0 no one is happier to see the president twisting republican arms than the democrats .                              
0 0 the democrats think they 're going to have a big issue here accusing republicans of shipping jobs overseas with unfair trade deals .              
0 0 that 's why charlie rangel was smiling .                                            
0 0 you know , it was interesting that he points out that republicans are becoming nervous .                            
0 0 they 're just starting to run away from president bush , because his approval rating is low .                        
0 0 the iraq war is unpopular .                                                
0 0 karl rove is in trouble and carlie 's just throwing more kerosene on the fire .                            
1 0 so , i love it .                                                
1 1 he 's just brilliant .                                                  
0 0 and joe ?                                                      
0 0 well , this is an important one of course .                                        
0 0 obviously , it 's not the largest agreement .                                          
0 0 you know , 32 billion does n't make it the largest agreement and i think all of these countries together in the composite would make them the 13th largest trading
0 0 so , it 's not a huge deal in that regard , but certainly going forward , it 's important .                  
0 0 so , i think the president was very , very smart .                                    
0 0 i mean , a lot of folks are saying now that the votes are there for this thing to be passed , but the president was very smart , i
1 0 there 's no substitute for personal charm and him going to the hill was -- i mean , normally folks come to the white house , but in this case
0 0 i think it was a smart move .                                            
0 0 does it seem to suggest though , desperation ?                                          
1 1 i mean , for lack of a better word , when you 're -- if you 've got to have the president personally lobbying ?          
0 0 it 's not just the pick up the phone and place a phone call to a few select members , this is ...              
0 0 well , these votes are important -- these votes are important and so , the president has to pay attention of course and he is .        
1 0 i think he 's doing the right thing by going to visit with members of congress and it 's good .                  
0 0 it shows a president in touch with the members of the house .                                  
0 0 it shows a president who 's asking vulnerable republicans to walk the plank on what joe accurately describes as a relatively minor trade deal .          
0 0 republicans are going to lose seats over this .                                          
0 0 president bush is not .                                                  
0 0 he 's not up for reelection .                                              
0 0 so , he 's going to men and women in who are in vulnerable districts -- not the safe republicans like bill thomas , but there are plenty of republicans
1 0 my president , bill clinton -- george bush is my president too , but when i worked for bill clinton , we did that to democrats on gun control and
0 0 and i think those republicans need to know tonight , that some of them voting for president bush are going to lose their job because of it .    
0 0 well , a lot just depends , too , on what the people buy ; whether or not they buy what republicans are saying .          
0 0 and republicans are saying : you know what , this is going to create jobs .                            
0 0 its is good for these trade barriers to come down .                                      
0 0 it 's going to create new jobs , that 's a good thing for the economy and it 's good for those central american countries where perhaps , communism and
0 0 this stops all that stuff .                                                
0 0 it creates a -- gives them more power , more economic leverage and makes them more viable .                        
0 0 and so , it ends up being a good thing for everybody .                                  
1 0 of course , democrats disagree with that .                                            
1 1 they 're saying , of course , that you lose jobs .                                    
0 0 does the strategy -- this essentially twisting arms and this personal appeal , does it actually work in the end and do you think that cafta -- bottom line ,
0 0 yes , i think it works .                                              
0 0 i think joe 's right .                                                
0 0 there 's nothing like a president looking a member in the eye and saying : i need you on this .                  
0 1 i think it 's going to work .                                            
0 0 i think they 're likely to pass it .                                          
0 0 yes , i think they probably have the votes .                                        
0 0 they would n't be calling the vote if tom delay and the others who run the house did n't think they had the votes .          
0 0 but i 'm telling you , the first person who 's going to lose his job over cafta is not going to be a textile worker north carolina .  
0 0 it 's going to be vulnerable republican congressmen on the ballot in '06 .                                
0 0 well you know , obviously the deal 's been sweetened by some side deals and so , that 's something to be considered , as well .      
0 0 but i think this ends up being a good thing .                                      
1 0 i think it passes and i think that as long as members can share with their constituents what this means for their district -- that is to say jobs --
0 0 if the district 's in ecuador , but there are not a lot of congressmen from ecuador and guatemala .                    
0 1 we 'll see what happens and i 'll call you both depending on what the results are .                        
0 0 so , i 'm going to hold you to this .                                      
0 0 all right .                                                      
0 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 we 'll see you in just a moment , but first , the defense secretary makes another unannounced visit to iraq , at the same time , the top u.s.
1 0 but there are some fairly substantial `` ifs '' involved .                                      
0 0 all that when this `` strategy session '' returns .                                        
0 0 i 'm zain verjee reporting from washington .                                            
0 0 coming up at the top of the hour : a big arrest in britain .                              
0 0 police think they have the man who tried to bomb the warren street underground station .                            
1 0 the pentagon talks about a big troop withdrawal from iraq .                                      
0 0 we 'll tell you how many , how soon .                                        
0 0 we 'll give you a hint , it 's likely not at the basketball court .                            
1 0 all those stories and much more just minutes away on `` wolf blitzer reports . ''                            
0 0 for now though , back to inside politics .                                          
0 0 this `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics with paul begala and joe watkins and what could happen in iraq .                
0 0 during an unannounced visit to baghdad by defense secretary donald rumsfeld , the top u.s. commander in iraq said u.s. troops , a lot of them , might head home
1 0 what are the chances that some of the estimated 135,000 american troops getting out ?                              
1 0 general george casey says it depends on a few things .                                      
1 0 if the political process continues to go positively and if the development of the security forces continues to go as it is going , i do believe we 'll still
0 0 that does sound like quite a few ifs : `` if this happens , and if , and if ... ''                  
0 0 very smart to say it that way .                                            
0 0 that 's a lot different than a timetable that 's been suggested by some like congressman jones , of course , some weeks ago , suggested that there be a
0 0 this is a , i think , a lot smarter approach .                                    
0 0 it gives hope certainly to the troops .                                            
0 0 it gives hop to the iraqi people .                                            
1 0 they 're moving forward nicely .                                                
0 0 they 've got elections that are due at the end of the year and if all goes well , if they complete all that stuff , there 's a good
0 0 but paul , does it give everyone false hope ?                                        
1 0 in other words : you put that out there like that and people start thinking : ok , well maybe , you know , relatives can start coming home .
0 0 how realistic is this even ?                                                
0 0 well , we 're getting mixed signals .                                            
1 0 general casey says this hopeful thing that we 'll be able to bring a whole lot of troops home next year , on the very day , as you pointed
0 0 now , we 're the liberating power here and our secretary of defense two years after the liberation , still has to hide and sneak around before he can go
1 0 the actions of the defense secretary , who 's acting like it 's not at all safe there by going there under cloak of secrecy or general casey , who
0 0 i certainly hope casey 's right .                                              
0 0 well , obviously the threat of terror is real everywhere .                                      
1 0 certainly in the middle east it is , given the sad thing that happened last week in egypt and certainly other threats that have been made .      
0 0 so i think it 's smart for any cabinet secretary , any high profile person to not let the folks know , not let the bad guys so to speak
0 0 but is n't it galling -- i say this is as an opponent of war -- is n't it galling that the country that liberated them from saddam hussein has
1 0 and the terrorist state of iran can send officials there in the broad daylight and no one -- they do n't worry about their security .        
0 0 it says something about the failure of the bush strategy in iraq .                                  
0 0 well , the good people in iraq are happy that don rumsfeld is there .                              
0 0 they 're happy that saddam is gone .                                            
1 0 and that 's most of the people in iraq .                                        
0 0 it 's just the insurgents which are pockets of people who disagree with what 's happening who want to cause and successfully have caused terror to take place .  
1 1 but those are the insurgents that are keeping the country from moving forward .                                
0 0 and do you think ...                                                  
0 0 although , it is moving forward .                                              
0 0 if you listen to what 's said here , it always seems like there are problems with the country moving forward .                
0 0 think of all the stuff they 've accomplished really in record time just in the last few months .                      
0 0 and if they have the elections as planned .                                          
1 0 and i 'm sure it will happen before the end of the year , that 's a good thing .                    
0 0 that 's a very good thing .                                              
0 0 that 's like saying most of the people at ford 's theater saw a good play .                          
0 0 ok , you know , but they shot lincoln .                                        
0 0 it was a bad day .                                                
0 0 i do n't mean to diminish what 's going on in iraq .                                  
0 0 but the news that we see on cnn every day is real .                                  
0 0 and it 's a reality for 150,000 american troops .                                        
0 0 and that 's , i think , where the focus is .                                    
1 0 that 's why when general casey says something like this , all of us on both sides of this become hopeful and optimistic .            
0 0 and i just hope it pans out .                                            
0 0 and final word .                                                    
1 0 we only have a short while .                                              
0 0 you can get the final word in .                                            
0 0 my friend , paul .                                                  
0 0 he 's so smart .                                                  
0 0 but the truth be told , he 's right .                                        
0 0 paul is actually right .                                                  
0 0 it 's a happy day for everybody .                                            
0 0 this is not a democrat or republican thing .                                          
1 1 this is an american thing and an iraqi thing and a thing of freedom thing .                            
0 0 and obviously , if those troops are able to come home and the transition is made successfully , everybody wins .                  
0 0 yes .                                                        
0 0 but first a couple of steps in the way .                                        
0 0 of course , august 15 , the deadline for the new constitution .                                  
0 0 and then , as you mentioned , the elections later this year .                                  
0 0 all right , thank you very much .                                            
0 0 paul begala , joe watkins , thank you very much for joining us .                                
0 0 we appreciate the time .                                                  
0 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 well , just when we thought senator rick santorum was not interested in running for president , the pennsylvania republican appears to be opening the door again .    
0 0 monday , santorum responded to a question during an online chat by saying he did not intend to run for the white house in 2008 .        
0 0 but at a breakfast meeting with reporters today , santorum said he would not completely rule out a run for president in '08 .            
0 0 he says it would take a strange remote set of circumstances to get him into the race .                        
0 0 we 'll try to pin santorum down tomorrow when he 's a guest on inside politics .                          
0 0 a missing person case gets new attention .                                            
0 0 up next , our blog reporters tell us about a story that received little notice until a blogger got involved .                  
0 0 the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee is raising questions about john bolton 's stalled nomination to be the ambassador to the u.n. at issue , whether bolton
0 0 and if so , when ?                                                
0 0 senator joe biden cites an msnbc report on july 21 that bolton had testified before the grand jury in the leak case .              
0 0 back in march , bolton filed a committee questionnaire requiring him to state whether he had testified before a grand jury within the past five years .      
0 0 biden is asking secretary of state condoleezza rice to clarify if and when bolton has testified in the leak case .                  
0 0 a philadelphia blogger has taken up the case of a missing woman .                                  
1 1 and now the mystery is receiving new attention .                                          
0 0 for more , let 's rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner , our blog reporter -- jacki .                  
0 0 hi , lisa .                                                    
0 0 a lot has been said online about how news coverage of missing people focuses very much on missing white women .                  
1 0 more so than on nonwhites .                                                
0 0 well , now there is a missing woman in the philadelphia area and one blogger is using his network of friends and fellow bloggers to get the word out about
0 0 the blogger behind this real push is a philadelphia blogger by the name of richard blair .                          
0 0 he blogs at allspinzone.com , which is a blog usually devoted to progressive politics .                              
0 0 earlier on in the week , and in fact last friday , richard was listening to local news reports , heard this story , but then over the weekend he
0 0 he decided to do something about it .                                            
0 0 he did numerous posts on his site , again allspinzone.com , about the case .                              
0 0 he also wrote a letter to cnn 's headline news trying to publicize the case .                            
0 0 on top of that , he used a mailing list , an e-mail list of his network of progressive bloggers to try and get the word out .    
0 0 he says this is something that bloggers do sparingly , but he sent out this post saying this is a very important story .            
1 0 i want you all to blog about it , all to follow it .                                
0 0 and it really seems to have worked .                                            
0 0 richard considers himself a mid tier political blog .                                          
0 0 and now he has gotten traction from some of the much larger blogs , including escaton .                          
0 0 that is duncan black 's atrios.blogspot.com .                                              
0 0 he is by far the largest progressive political blog in the philadelphia area .                                
0 0 he has linked back to the all spin zone .                                        
0 0 that will definitely help the traffic to that .                                          
0 0 also , richard has posted in a diary at dailykos.com , that one of the top liberal blogs also getting more than half a million hits a day from what
0 0 but you do n't have to be a giant blog to help .                                  
0 0 and there are a lot of local philadelphia blogs who are chiming in right now .                            
0 0 and we like this over at the smedley blog , basically saying you do n't have giant readership in order to help out .            
0 0 just put the photograph on your blog , post a little bit of information , track back to the all spin zone .              
1 0 even if it 's one or two people that read your blog , that 's one or two more people out there who can really put her face on the
0 0 and maybe help to find her .                                              
0 0 but the idea is not just publicity for blair .                                        
0 0 what he 's trying to fund raise , to get money for a reward fund , hoping that more people will come ahead with information .        
0 0 he looked at a local citizen 's crime group that was looking at this story , as well and saw that they will had a fundraising drive going , but
0 0 so what he did was work with them to invite people to his site in order to donate directly from his web site using his paypal account .    
1 1 he had been fundraising for his own blog , his quarterly fundraising drive , but he gave that up on saturday to help this effort to help this missing woman
0 0 back to you , lisa .

sentence: 
    house republicans launch another benghazi investigation , and in the same breath launch a fund-raising pitch promising to hold hillary clinton accountable .              
    she thinks it 's a waste of time .                                          
    but they get to call the shots in the congress .                                      
1 0 house speaker john boehner defends the new investigation , but wo n't answer when asked if the fundraising dishonors the victims and proves it 's all crass politics .  
1 0 our focus -- our focus is getting the truth for these poor families and for the american people .                      
1 0 plus , tough words after the kidnapping of young girls in nigeria .                                  
1 0 it 's criminal , it 's an act of terrorism .                                      
1 0 but if citizen clinton feels that way , why did secretary of state clinton refuse to label the kidnappers terrorists ?                  
0 0 and score another big win for the republican establishment .                                        
1 0 it 's really the beginning of our primary mission , which has been the mission all along , and that is to beat kay hagan and to make harry reid
1 0 the tea party rocked the system in 2010 and 2012 , so why is it getting crushed in 2014 ?                    
0 0 inside politics , the biggest stories sourced by the best reporters , now .                                
0 0 welcome to inside politics .                                                  
0 0 i 'm john king .                                                  
0 0 thank you for sharing your sunday morning .                                            
0 0 and happy mother 's day .                                                
0 0 with us today to share their reporting and their insights , nia- malika henderson of the washington post , maggie haberman of politico , robert costa of the washington post
0 0 it was , to say the least , a rather bizarre week in politics .                              
0 0 there are 31 -- count them -- 31 months left in the barack obama presidency .                            
0 0 and yet , his first chief of staff , now the chicago mayor , rahm emanuel , decided it was time to endorse hillary clinton for president .    
0 0 that was friday , one day after house republicans officially launched a new benghazi investigation .                            
0 0 `` just the facts '' is what republicans insist they 're after .                                  
0 0 yet a fundraising pitch sent out by an official party committee twice in six paragraphs says `` before any new facts have been gathered , the goal of this investigation
0 0 no wonder , then , that the current president might feel a little overlooked and maybe a little frustrated .                    
1 0 i have this remarkable title right now , president of the united states .                                
0 0 and yet every day when i wake up and i think about young girls in nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in syria , when there are times
1 0 julianna goldman , you cover the white house every day .                                      
0 0 obvious frustration of the president that he seems , at times , powerless to do much about tragic world events .                  
0 0 do they have the same frustration in the conversations back home , even democrats , a lot , seem to forget that he 's still there .      
0 0 he has 31 months left and they 're already talking about either ignoring him in this year 's campaign or talking about hillary clinton in 2016 .      
1 1 well , i think the white house feels that if he is going to get hammered by the democrats in this year 's campaign that they at least want to
0 0 but even in -- in that clip from the president , what you saw there was someone , he 's very deliberative , he takes the long view , he
0 0 and so what he 's showing there is this horrible story that has emerged over the last three weeks of nearly 300 young schoolgirls kidnapped by boko haram in nigeria
0 0 the issue for him is that americans want to see their leader projecting a more powerful presence , and that 's not what he did there .      
1 0 and so let 's -- we 'll come back to the president in a second .                            
0 0 but i want to come to this new benghazi investigation , because it 's a big moment , the republicans say , to pursue more facts .      
0 0 but -- and i think this was a mistake , this is john king speaking , a mistake that at the same time you announce a new select committee ,
0 0 and the white house has led to these republican questions by not being so transparent in releasing documents .                      
1 0 `` friend , house republicans are moving fast to hold hillary clinton and barack obama accountable for their actions .                    
0 0 we need your name on a list of activists who want to get to the bottom of what happened and what hillary clinton 's involvement was . ''    
0 0 if you 're pursuing new facts , well , how do you know already that you 're holding them accountable ?                  
1 0 oh , there 's a constant tension , right now , in the house republican cloakroom .                          
0 0 boehner , the house republican leadership , they want to seem somber .                                  
0 0 they want to seem serious about this entire process .                                        
0 0 but they 're getting so much pressure from the right flank of the party , who have been frustrated about the white house 's response to the attacks , that
1 0 but you ca n't wait a week , you ca n't wait a month , maggie , you ca n't tell your people , do n't do this now .
0 0 if we want to make this a credible investigation , we ca n't be cloaking it in politics on day one ?                
1 0 you -- you could tell your people we do n't want to do this right now , but it obviously did n't happen .            
0 0 it 's not clear whether there was an opportunity to say , do n't do this or not do this .                  
0 0 and from boehner 's reaction , i thought it seemed as if he might not have been thrilled with this when he got asked about it .      
0 0 he did n't kind of go one way or the other .                                    
0 0 that having been said , yes , to your point , this looks not great in terms of timing .                    
0 0 this is also not the first time we 've seen this , either from republicans or from democrats where there is a tragedy and you see people fundraise off it
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 0 because the republican base is extremely into this issue , believe there is something there , and this helps low dollar donations , and it is a very volatile competitive
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 and when i criticized this , republicans are quick to point out democrats sometimes do it after school shootings , they get into the gun control debate , and things
0 0 so it is probably inevitable and a sign of the times now .                                  
0 0 we talked at the beginning , we 've heard the president talking about boko haram .                            
0 0 hillary clinton also , at an event this week , she was asked -- she was asked about these kidnappings in nigeria .              
0 0 let 's listen .                                                    
1 0 the seizure of these young women by this radical extremist group , boko haram , is abominable , it 's criminal , it 's an act of terrorism , and
1 0 she has faced some criticism , nia , from republicans who say , well , then , when you were secretary of state , why did you refuse the justice
0 0 a fair criticism ?                                                    
1 1 yes , they got a lot of criticism and really prodding from folks on the hill , as well , wanting to designate this a terrorist reaction .    
0 0 they -- a terrorist organization .                                                
0 0 their response was if we do that , then it would elevate this group and give it a sort of profile and prominence that it had n't had before .
0 0 and it also might give the nigerian government sort of leeway to interact , and go after this group in a way that -- that would , you know ,
0 0 and you have seen that from the nigerian government already in some instances .                                
0 0 but i think this gets to the fact , in many ways , the title of her upcoming book , `` hard choices , '' you can say one thing
1 0 and she thinks at the time she may have had a good policy reason , do n't elevate them , do n't help them get extremist fundraising , do n't
0 0 and that 's a meta policy decision she made that next time will be a political debate , because -- if she wants to be president .      
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 and even just listening to her there , she called it a radical extremist group , and the administration is quick to point out that in november of 2013 ,
0 0 and so it just shows , you know , as she sets up her bid for the presidency , every foreign policy eruption is going to be -- come back
1 0 she also spoke out -- and i 'm all for candidates speaking their mind and being clear what they think .                  
0 0 it 's not our job .                                                
0 0 it 's your job , the voters , to decide whether you like it or not .                          
0 0 but listen to her here talking about guns this week and being very clear .                              
1 0 we 've got to rein in what has become an almost article of faith that anybody can have a gun anywhere anytime .              
1 0 robert , she was talking about concealed carry laws and the like .                                  
0 0 she said , people should n't be able to walk into a movie theater , walk into a sporting event , walk into a bar carrying a weapon .  
0 0 again , i applaud any candidate who speaks their mind .                                      
0 0 if you think otherwise , say it , say it , and put it out there .                          
0 0 she has put that on the record now .                                          
0 0 a lot of people think al gore , and i think this is a bit of an urban myth , that he lost the presidency because of gun control issues
0 0 but , if she runs , we 're going to see that , right , in battleground florida , in battleground ohio , battleground colorado ?        
1 0 i think secretary clinton 's comments are actually smart politics .                                      
0 0 i mean , she 's looking ahead , perhaps , to a general election .                              
0 0 and she -- she sees some movement in congress on toomey- manchin and other initiatives .                            
0 0 and she 's speaking to those suburban voters in places like philadelphia where they really have a lot of concerns , and speaking to them not just -- to the
1 0 she is speaking to the democratic base .                                            
0 0 she is being mindful of both flanks .                                            
0 0 and the fact that , as robert said , there has been movement in terms of mainstream voters , as opposed to one party 's base or another , she
0 0 al gore 's candidacy probably could never have survived some of what democrats say now .                            
0 0 but she sees where things are .                                              
1 0 i think you make a key point , she 's looking at a map that she thinks is more favorable for democrats now ...            
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 1 ... on this issue than when al gore was running .                                      
0 0 let 's close this conversation with this .                                            
0 0 monica lewinsky , i spent a lot of time , got a lot of these gray hairs 16 years ago covering the impeachment saga .          
0 0 monica lewinsky came out and gave an interview to vanity fair .                                    
0 0 and the debate in washington is , does this help or hurt hillary clinton ?                              
0 0 does it remind you of the circus and the baggage of bill clinton ?                                
0 0 does it remind a younger generation that maybe knows nothing about this or little about this ...                          
1 1 right , yes .                                                    
1 1 do we know ?                                                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 you know , i mean , if you look historically , i have called monica lewinsky hillary clinton 's sort of `` unintended wing-woman . ''        
0 0 i mean , she has done -- when this came out , hillary clinton had her highest approval ratings back in march of 1998 , 65 percent .    
0 0 so i do n't think it hurts her .                                          
0 0 i think , in some ways , what you 're going to see going forward is when she is out on that book tour , since monica lewinsky has come
0 0 but it does remind you of , you know , sort of the drama of the clintons and the baggage and the idea of ...          
1 1 she wo n't like those questions .                                              
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 exactly .                                                        
1 1 but she would prefer to answer them now than in 2015 or 2016 , would n't she ?                        
1 0 i would imagine , yes .                                                
0 0 and in as minimal a fashion as possible .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 so ...                                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 i like that phrase ...                                                  
0 1 how many politicians can do that ?                                              
0 0 `` as minimal a fashion as possible . ''                                          
0 0 everybody stay put .                                                    
0 0 up next , a look at why the tea party that had so many wins in 2010 and 2012 is so puzzled in 2014 .          
0 0 but first , in this week 's installment of `` politicians sometimes say the darnedest things , '' massachusetts governor deval patrick scoffs at buzz he would make a good
1 0 mr. vice president ?                                                    
1 1 let me simply say i do n't have a plan yet , but it will not be to be number two .                
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 our puzzle this week explores the tea party 's 2014 slump at the ballot box in 2014 .                        
0 0 but first , a little history .                                              
0 0 remember when the tea party crashed onto the scene in 2010 ?                                    
0 1 you had these eight candidates , all of them beat establishment candidates in republican primaries .                            
0 0 now , the establishment did n't like that much , but it especially did n't like when ken buck in colorado , joe miller in alaska , sharron angle in
0 0 that was 2010 .                                                    
0 0 then , in 2012 , more of the same .                                        
0 0 these four candidates in senate races all beat establishment candidates in the primary .                                
0 0 and , again , richard murdock in indiana , todd akin in missouri , lost in november , leaving on the table seats republicans , especially these two , think
0 0 so let 's fast forward .                                                
0 0 five primaries so far in 2014 , zero -- no tea party upsets so far .                            
0 0 thirty-one primaries will be done by the end of june .                                      
0 0 will the tea party get anybody ?                                              
0 0 it 's a big open question at the moment .                                        
0 0 the next contest to watch , mitch mcconnell of kentucky later this month , thad cochran june 3rd in the state of mississippi , two incumbents that if the 2010
0 0 at the moment , though , republicans are pretty confident .                                      
0 0 cochran not quite out of the woods yet .                                          
0 0 the question , maggie haberman , is , we have a ways to go , but so far , the tea party is getting crushed , to use mitch mcconnell
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 0 why is it different this time than 2010 and 2012 ?                                      
1 0 the energy is very different than it was in 2010 .                                      
0 0 it 's also important to remember the element of surprise , right , in terms of the tea party wave was literally a wave .          
0 0 this has now been sort of a slow roll for the last several years .                              
0 0 you also have an establishment that has gotten prepared and that was n't leaving itself exposed , and that 's pretty clear and pretty obvious .        
0 0 you have groups like the chamber of commerce that are going in and spending very heavy , very aggressively .                    
0 0 you began to see it first in florida-13 , but you 've seen it in a lot of other places .                  
0 0 you 're also in places like the thad cochran race , it 's very important to remember that that is not a seat the democrats are going to pick up
0 0 so regardless , that 's a bit of a different situation .                                    
0 0 to your point about 2010 , those were seats that became blue , in some cases .                          
0 0 it 's not quite the same impetus now .                                          
0 0 republicans see a chance to put the tea party away in a lot of these primaries .                          
0 0 and then that 's the game .                                              
1 0 but some -- let 's put it this way , robert , is the tea party , in some ways , winning by losing in the sense that thom tillis
0 0 the tea party did n't want him .                                            
0 0 they had some other candidates they liked more .                                          
0 0 but it 's not like he was campaigning on a path to citizenship or , hey , let 's raise taxes or , hey , let 's give barack obama
1 0 i think north carolina 's primary is a great case study in what 's happened within the republican party .                    
0 0 the party has shifted so far to the right that tillis on -- when it comes to his platform , when it comes to his ideology , he 's in
0 0 and i think that 's a victory for the tea party .                                    
0 0 they still may be nominating or pushing candidates that are a little flawed .                                
0 1 you see chris mcdaniel in mississippi , brannon in north carolina .                                    
0 0 these were n't top tier candidates .                                              
0 0 but when it comes to who actually ends up nominated this cycle , they have tea party platforms .                      
1 0 and maggie also made an interesting point about the chamber spending money .                                  
0 0 there are also people who spent money to help those tea party candidates last time who are not spending money this time .              
1 0 yes , although that 's why i think you ca n't necessarily say that the tea party has lost just yet and that the establishment has hands-down won .  
0 0 i mean , we need to see how the next few primary contests play out .                            
0 1 and it also depends on the candidate and where some of these outside groups -- so you might see another -- and you will see in other some of these
1 1 yes , i think that 's right .                                            
0 0 i think we have to see .                                              
0 0 we have to see what happens in georgia .                                          
0 0 we have to see if chris mcmillan is able to gain any traction in mississippi .                            
0 0 he 's talking about citizen -- or residency of his -- his challenger there .                              
0 0 so i think it 's a matter of what 's going to happen in these next couple of weeks .                    
0 0 but i also think we have seen this party shift to the right and that is a credit to the tea party .              
1 0 the establishment feels very confident about lindsey graham in south carolina , very confident about mitch mcconnell .                        
0 0 they think cochran , although they say he 's not quite out of the woods yet , so we 'll watch that one play out .        
0 0 here 's my question .                                                  
0 0 will 2015 be -- you mentioned -- and everyone agrees , everybody in the republican party has tacked to the right .                
0 0 mitch mcconnell is not talking about it .                                            
0 0 john boehner has stopped talking about a grand bargain with the president .                                  
0 0 they wo n't do that .                                                
0 0 they wo n't bring immigration to the floor now .                                        
0 0 but if they get through 2014 , will 2015 be what i call `` the year of the revenge '' ?                  
0 0 will john boehner and mitch mcconnell -- especially if mcconnell wins the senate and as leader , will they bring up immigration reform with a path to status or citizenship
0 0 will they make it easier or less drama for the president to raise the debt ceiling ?                          
0 0 will repealing obamacare become amending obamacare ?                                              
0 0 and will that be the revenge against the tea party ?                                      
1 0 you know , i think we 've got to see .                                      
0 0 i mean , you mentioned mitch mcconnell , if they win the senate , he would possibly be the majority leader .                
0 0 we do n't know about the house , right ?                                        
0 0 i mean , is there going to be a revenge against the establishment in the house , where the tea party says , well , it 's our turn now
0 0 i do think it is instructive , though , to look at clinton 's presidency .                            
0 0 in many ways , he was able to get more things done in those last six years because he had , you know , those two houses of congress that
1 0 and if mitch mcconnell is the leader with 52 , 51 , and he still has ted cruz , there will be -- they may not -- the tea party
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so how does that play out ?                                              
1 1 i think that it increases ted cruz 's influence .                                        
0 0 it increases the influence of these voices who have become more marginalized in that respect .                            
0 0 the big question mark for me -- and you could speak to this , i think , more than i can , but the big question mark for me is
0 0 i do n't know what further leverage he is going to have to try to get people to do the revenge scenario .              
0 0 i do think you have republicans who believe they need to make some fixes on what has happened this cycle to help themselves for 2016 .        
1 0 but i was , just quickly , on capitol hill on friday , and i was meeting with some house republicans .                
0 0 and they had an interesting point .                                              
0 0 they said with boehner 's benghazi select committee , with the way he endured the shutdown , they think he 's building up his political capital this year in the
1 0 all right .                                                      
0 0 we 'll watch .                                                    
0 0 2014 is a prelude to 2015 .                                              
0 0 everybody stay put .                                                    
0 0 next , our great reporters share tomorrow 's news today , including a bush family incursion on chris christie 's new jersey turf .            
0 0 it 's our mission each week to get you out ahead of the big political stories to come by asking our great reporters to share some nuggets still in their
0 0 julianna , you 're up .                                                
1 0 all right , so every election cycle , democrats pick the corporate villain , right ?                            
0 0 they use it as a foil for republicans , the boogeyman to put democrats on the side of main street , republicans on the side of special interests .  
0 0 well , the problem for the white house this year is they really do n't have a good corporate villain .                  
0 0 they ca n't go after oil , because that hurts louisiana .                                    
0 0 it hurts alaska 's senate candidates .                                              
0 0 they ca n't go after health insurers , because the president needs them on their side for obamacare .                      
0 0 they ca n't go after the koch brothers , even though harry reid is , because democrats are saying -- the white house says , hey , our hands are
0 0 so it makes that targeted message all the more difficult for democrats and the white house this year .                      
0 0 and so they 've settled on `` republicans , inc. '' to vilify republicans .                              
0 0 but it 's just not as strong of a message as they 've had in the past .                        
1 1 an excellent point .                                                    
0 0 robert ?                                                        
1 1 on monday morning , governor mike pence of indiana will be at the grand hyatt hotel in new york city participating in a monday meeting , a gathering of conservative
0 0 and he has later meetings scheduled with donors throughout the city .                                    
0 0 i think pence is moving toward a run .                                          
0 0 he still acts like his focus is indiana , but you do n't go to new york city and go to that meeting unless you have some interest .  
1 0 you do n't .                                                    
1 0 i was planning on attending that meeting , actually .                                        
0 0 in more new jersey news , chris christie and jeb bush news , it was reported on politico , you had tom kean jr. host a fundraiser for george p.
0 0 his father , tom kean , was at this event .                                      
0 0 and tom kean told me that he found george p. bush wonderful , delightful .                              
0 0 he could not have lauded him more strongly .                                          
0 0 and it was taken very privately by a lot of republicans in new jersey as an attempt to needle chris christie in the latest in their ongoing feud , because
1 0 love politics .                                                      
1 0 kirsten gillibrand and claire mccaskill , who are somewhat at odds over what to do about rampant military sexual assault , are joining forces and trying to really shed light
0 0 on monday , they 're going to have meetings with stakeholders , university administration officials , law enforcement , students who have been victims of sexual assault .    
0 0 i think , in many ways , we 're beginning to see what it means to have 20 women in the senate .              
0 0 and so that will start monday , and , really , i think , kick off , at some point , hearings , as well , that looks into this
1 0 we should all wish them well on a bipartisan basis .                                      
1 0 `` not much buzz at all because so many of us are , quote , 'still waiting ' on jeb . ''                
0 0 that would be jeb bush .                                                
0 0 that 's it for inside politics .                                              
0 0 again , thanks for sharing your sunday morning with us .                                      
0 0 happy mother 's day .

    republicans strike back against democrats making demands on john roberts .                                      
    our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president 's nominee to the supreme court
    will there be a fierce partisan fight after all ?                                        
0 0 trading allegations .                                                      
1 0 the republican majority , once again , turned the floor of the house into a set for `` let 's make a deal . ''          
1 0 the house gives president bush the trade pact he wanted , but were ethical lines crossed to make that happen ?                  
0 0 soaring hopes and now dashed dreams .                                              
0 0 the grounding of the space shuttle fleet leaves the space program in limbo .                                
1 0 everything is back almost to square zero .                                            
1 0 and is he in , or out ?                                            
0 0 we 'll ask senator rick santorum to clarify his presidential intentions , and talk about his literary showdown with hillary clinton .                
0 0 now , live from washington , cnn 's inside politics .                                      
1 0 thanks for joining us .                                                  
0 0 i 'm ed henry .                                                  
0 0 in the week and a half since president bush nominated john roberts , democrats have been going after the supreme court nominee a little more each day .    
0 0 it may not a full frontal attack , but some republicans seem to have had enough , so they 're taking new steps to keep roberts ' nomination on track
1 0 ... senators for dinner at this washington steakhouse , to help cool growing tension over the supreme court battle .                    
1 0 i 'm optimistic .                                                    
0 0 we 've been having good meetings and , you know , hopefully all the things will be resolved .                      
1 0 fred thompson dined with key members of the so-called gang of 14 moderates , who earlier helped avert a nuclear crisis over lower court judges .        
0 0 senators say the meeting with thompson will help diffuse sudden skirmishes over the timing of confirmation meetings and how many documents the white house needs to produce .    
1 0 i think it 's just kind of ground noise that happens , and nobody ever thought it was going to be a complete smooth trip .        
0 0 so i think it 's going to be all right .                                      
1 0 but republican leaders do not seem so optimistic .                                          
1 0 our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president 's nominee to the supreme court
1 0 at issue , the fact that the white house has turned over thousands of pages of documents from roberts ' time as a young lawyer in the reagan administration ,
1 0 now , i know that the white house press secretary much prefers talking about karl rove , but i would suggest to him that that is probably an unrealistic standard
1 0 republicans insist the papers are covered by the attorney/client privilege .                                      
1 0 we should stop this game of `` gotcha '' and move to the goal post that it appears that we have already begun .            
1 0 the white house , meanwhile , is trying to steer clear of a partisan fight over whether the hearings should start in august or septmeber .        
1 0 oh that 's -- i 'll leave that for others to work out .                                
0 0 we will show up whenever it 's scheduled .                                          
1 0 and democrats are not showing any sign of backing off from their demands or from asking tough questions .                      
0 0 the senate judiciary committee sent a 10-page questionnaire to judge roberts yesterday .                                  
0 0 it could lead to new information about his role in the florida presidential recount battle of 2000 .                        
0 0 and seven democratic women in the senate are launching a new web site to solicit questions to ask roberts during his confirmation hearings .            
0 0 at that news conference , senator hillary clinton was asked if she would vote against roberts if he testified that roe v. wade is not settled law .    
0 0 she sidestepped that question , saying , quote , `` i want to wait and see how he answers . ''                  
0 0 another flash-point on the hill today , the house democratic leaders accusing republicans of using questionable tactics to get a controversial trade deal passed .          
0 0 the central american free trade agreement , known as cafta , cleared the house by a two-vote margin last night .                  
0 0 it would eliminate trade barriers between the u.s. and guatemala , el salvador , honduras , nicaragua , costa rica and the dominican republic .          
0 0 the vote dragged on for an hour amid last-minute negotiating and arm-twisting by gop leaders , and after president bush and vice president cheney personally lobbied lawmakers .    
0 0 house minority leader nancy pelosi urged reporters to ask republicans how far they went to secure a cafta victory .                    
1 0 i do know of reports that have been made to me about offers that were made to democrats and they came running in saying it did n't sound like it
0 0 but they know what they 've done and they know it 's at additional cost to the u.s. taxpayer .                    
0 0 you should ask them .                                                  
1 0 i 'll talk with minority leader pelosi a bit later on inside politics .                                
0 0 right now , let 's find out what the white house is saying about cafta , now headed to the president 's desk since the senate approved the pact last
0 0 here 's our white house correspondent suzanne malveaux -- suzanne .                                      
1 0 well , ed , of course the white house is very happy about this .                              
0 0 this is a big victory for the president .                                          
0 0 he intentionally kept his schedule open so he could do some serious lobbying .                                
0 0 as you mentioned before , of course , it was really quite a scene on capitol hill over the last 12 to 24 hours .          
0 0 president bush making a rare appearance .                                              
0 0 also , of course , vice president dick cheney , as well as the secretaries of commerce , agriculture , u.s. trade representative .            
0 0 all of them there to try to push forward those republicans to pass cafta .                              
0 0 as you had mentioned before , some call it some arm-twisting and some deal-making here , but the focal point was earlier this week .          
0 0 that is when the president went behind closed doors before the republican conference and essentially said to them , this is not just a matter of opening up these markets
1 0 it helps to strengthen democracy in our own hemisphere .                                        
0 0 this goes right to our own national security .                                          
0 0 this is an agreement that will help extend peace and prosperity throughout the western hemisphere .                            
0 0 while we are working to advance freedom abroad , we also need to be looking in our own hemisphere and make sure that we 're supporting the democratic efforts that
1 0 now , ed , as you know , of course , this was a particularly tough fight for the president for a couple of reasons .        
0 0 it did not fall strictly along party lines .                                          
0 0 there were rather regional pockets of republicans who represented , essentially , the sugar , the textile industries .                      
0 0 their constituents were quite concerned about the cost to u.s. jobs .                                    
0 0 those were the ones that they were after to convince .                                      
0 0 first it was north carolina that folded , went from no to yes , then you had ohio as well as pennsylvania decided to get on board .    
0 0 the other aspect of this , as well , is that the democrats were very united in their stance .                    
0 0 this was a labor issue , but it was also a party loyalty issue .                              
0 0 the white house only able to pick off about 15 democrats for the cafta -- for that passage .                      
0 0 ultimately , it worked out for the president in the end .                                    
0 0 this is a white house that is quite pleased .                                        
0 0 they are also looking at the energy bill , the highway bill as other potential victories .                          
0 0 and this , of course , ironically in light -- when you look at the bigger picture -- their centerpiece for the domestic agenda , social security , has failed
1 0 ok , suzanne malveaux from the white house .                                          
0 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 while the bush administration touts that victory as a boon for national security and stability , the american people increasingly have their doubts about trade benefits .      
0 0 48 percent of those surveyed for our new poll say they see foreign trade as a threat to the united states .                
0 0 that 's up from 41 percent in 2003 , and 35 percent in 2000 .                              
0 0 i spoke earlier today , in fact , with u.s. trade representative rob portman about resistance to cafta , and the horse trading that got it passed .    
0 0 i began by asking the former gop congressman just how wild the scene was on capitol hill last night .                    
1 0 well , it was n't too wild in the sense that we knew where most members of congress were going to end up , but there was a small group
0 0 and the way we persuaded them to support this agreement was the agreement itself .                              
0 0 it 's a fundamentally sound agreement because it opens up the markets in central america , just as they already have to access to markets .        
0 0 so it was a fair-trade agreement .                                              
0 0 it was our ability to say to members of congress that this ought to not just be free trade , but fair trade ...            
1 1 but if it was fair trade ...                                              
1 1 ... and end up being beneficial .                                              
1 0 but if it was fair trade , i wonder why so many republicans had a hard time supporting it and took so long to actually get it through .  
0 0 there was a lobbyist against cafta who told `` the wall street journal '' today , quote , `` if they voted their conscience , cafta would fail by 50
0 0 is n't it true you really had to barter and offer up roads and bridges and other pork projects to get this through ?            
1 0 no , i feel just the opposite about it .                                        
0 0 as you said , i was in congress for 12 years .                                    
0 0 i was in the leadership , i was a member of the whip team , i had been through a lot of these votes , including trade promotion authority .
0 0 and the truth is , if members had voted their conscience , we would have won by 50 votes .                    
0 0 because members , when they looked at this agreement , realized it was a good agreement , good agreement for our country , but also good agreement for central america
0 0 the fact is , the politics is what made it difficult on this vote .                              
1 0 but ...                                                        
1 1 and the fact is that those who oppose trade threw everything but the kitchen sink at this agreement , ed .                  
0 0 and you know that when we first got started on this exercise , we were way behind because labor unions and others who oppose trade this is the one ,
0 0 we 're going to stop this agreement .                                            
0 0 the other agreements with countries like australia , jordan , morocco , and so on , did not have that same controversy .              
0 0 the controversy was brought on by those who oppose trade , and made this a political vote .                        
0 0 so , courageous members stood up and voted their conscience and did the right thing for america .                        
1 0 but mr .                                                      
0 0 ambassador , if the economic benefits of this were so good , why did you not sell it as an economic package ?              
0 0 instead , we had the president , vice president and the secretary of state among others on the hill this week , saying it was a national security issue not
0 0 and they were saying it was about stabilizing democracies in central america .                                  
0 0 some lawmakers in both are saying what does that have to do with trade ?                              
0 0 you should be worrying about the economy in the united states .                                    
1 0 well , i can tell you as the quarterback , i guess , of the effort -- i talked about the economic benefits constantly , as did the president .
0 0 the reality is that although it 's 44 million consumers , and our second biggest market in latin america , the trade benefits of this agreement are not as large
0 0 for instance even the mexican agreement that we did back in the 90s , or even the world trade organization agreement .                
0 0 but the benefits were clear .                                                
0 0 the fact is that because the politics were so tough , because the other side , again , tried everything they could to derail this , that it was not
0 0 but you had the president make a rare visit to the hill and personally lobby on this .                        
0 0 and he still got only a republican-lead house to pass it by only two volts , does n't that confirm that he is , in fact , a lame duck
0 0 and he 's having a hard time getting his own republicans on board with his agenda ?                          
0 0 absolutely not .                                                      
0 0 this agreement , was again , a huge uphill battle .                                      
0 0 it was way behind , because those who opposed trade , again , did everything they could and focused on this agreement trying , frankly with regard to these central
0 0 and so the president had an uphill battle .                                          
0 0 and he did a good job .                                              
0 0 and by the way when he came to the hill , i was there , he did talk about the central america free trade agreement .        
0 0 but for about 10 percent of will time , he also talked about all the other agenda items that we had accomplished .              
0 0 and what was coming up , including the energy bill and the highway bill and so on .                        
0 0 and it was great that he came to the hill .                                      
0 0 he does n't do it often .                                              
0 0 but he tends to do it toward the end of a session like this or when we are going into a break .              
0 0 so it was a helpful rallying cry .                                            
0 0 but it was n't just on the central american free trade agreement .                                  
0 0 that was rob portman , the u.s. trade representative talking about last night 's victory on the central american free trade agreement .              
0 0 we now want to turn to texas and update you on a story breaking this afternoon , an explosion has torn through a chemical plant on the north side of
0 0 there are an undetermined number of injuries .                                            
0 0 we 've heard at least four injured .                                            
0 0 you can see the black smoke , which can be seen for miles throughout ft. worth .                          
0 0 we want to bring in now eric lamar .                                          
0 0 he is the director of hazmat training for the international association of firefighters here in washington .                          
0 0 mr. lamar , are you there ?                                              
1 0 i am , ed , how are you ?                                          
1 0 good , how are you .                                                
0 0 thank you for joining us .                                                
0 0 i understand you have been watching by television .                                          
0 0 can you give us an idea of what your immediate reaction is from watching that of how bad of a blaze this is ?            
1 0 well , clearly it 's a catastrophic event .                                          
0 0 they appear to have the vast majority of the structure involved in a huge fire .                            
0 0 it sounds like from what i learned earlier , it is a -- it 's a concern of where they have bulk storage of a wide variety of chemicals .
0 0 so they have a serious hazardous materials incident on their hands .                                    
1 0 so now , since this is obviously not a normal fire , how do the firefighters approach it ?                      
0 0 give us an idea of how you attack a fire like this .                                  
0 0 lamar : well , from what i can see , they are certainly taking what we would refer to as a defensive posture .            
0 0 so , essentially , they have made the decision that there 's no way to conduct an offensive interior attack in the building .            
0 0 so from the video , you can definitely see that they have set up large streams some distance from the building .                
0 0 and they are going to try to control the fire to the extent that they can , using these large streams while they obviously keep the public away .  
0 0 and also they are keeping firefighting forces , hopefully , a safe distance away from the building , although you can see that they are continuing to have some really
0 0 so you want to stay back as far as you can , acknowledging that all they are able to do at this point is really to try to protect exposures
0 0 now , you can see those dramatic pictures .                                          
0 0 it appears that the wind was really blowing this fire with more force .                                
0 0 and right past those power lines .                                              
0 0 is that another concern , given those power lines right there around the fire that we saw a moment ago .                  
0 0 how do you approach that ?                                                
1 1 well , obviously power lines are a concern .                                          
0 0 but i think , you know , you are looking at the immediate fire area at this point .                      
0 0 a serious issue .                                                    
0 0 it 's going to try to be , can you confine the fire and protect the exposures that are closest to the building .            
0 0 and then you also obviously have other issues in an incident like this .                                
0 0 for instance , they have to be concerned about the smoke plume downwind .                                
0 0 what 's contained in that plume ?                                              
0 0 do they have to worry about downwind evacuation ?                                          
0 1 how far downwind is appropriate ?                                                
0 0 and of course , from the explosions that we 're seeing , from those explosions , is there a significant debris problem ?              
0 0 what 's the danger area there ?                                              
0 0 so , of course , their primary interest at the incident is going to be life safety definitely at that property , but also figuring out in the immediate area
0 0 who has to be evacuated ?                                                
0 0 and then as i mentioned a minute ago , because it is a hazmat incident and they have this downwind smoke problem , how do you effectively and quickly evacuate
1 0 ok .                                                        
0 0 thank you very much .                                                  
0 0 eric lamar a hazmat expert at the international association of firefighters .                                    
0 0 thank you for joining us .                                                
0 0 as you can see , the fire is still raging .                                      
0 0 we will be checking back in in ft worth throughout the afternoon and evening as news warrants .                        
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 democratic house leader nancy pelosi today had some tough comments about republican efforts to secure last night 's victory on the central american free trade agreement .      
0 0 pelosi even questioned whether some questionable deals might have been made by republicans in getting votes .                          
0 0 i spoke with nancy pelosi a short while ago and asked her about those allegations .                            
1 0 what i said was that the republicans turned the floor of the house of representatives into a `` let 's make a deal '' set .        
0 0 it was reminiscent of what happened at the time of the medicare prescription drug legislation that evening .                        
0 0 and again this time they kept the vote open a long time .                                  
0 0 but many of the overtures that were made to members was made before even going to the floor .                      
0 0 so this is about , again , an abuse of power , in an unethical way of passing legislations .                    
0 0 and depending on what members decide to do , may require further attention .                                
1 0 but now , it seems to me , you have a responsibility as a leader in congress if , in fact you believe there was some corruption , whether it
1 0 well , what i will say to you very clearly is that i do think there is a culture of corruption in the capitol of the united states .  
0 0 that they have turned the gavel of the speaker into an auctioneers gavel .                                
0 0 and that 's what i am talking about .                                          
0 0 and that would have been a abuse of power in that regard .                                  
0 0 and i have said that over and over , again .                                      
0 0 and last night was a further manifestation of it .                                        
1 0 but madam leader , we also heard that union leaders were going around saying that any democrat supporting this central american free trade agreement would not get political support ,
0 0 what 's the difference there ?                                                
0 0 it seems like democrats are also bean muscled .                                          
1 0 there 's plenty of difference .                                                
0 0 if the labor movement , or the chamber of commerce says to members of congress , we support those who support us , that 's what they do .  
0 0 they are outside groups .                                                  
0 0 when taxpayer money is being used by the administration , or by the republican leadership in the congress to persuade members to vote a certain way , i think that
1 0 what do you think it says about the president 's political standing right now , that he put his personal capital on the line , the vice president spent several
0 0 what does that say ?                                                  
1 0 well , it says they did n't have a good idea in the first place .                            
0 0 democrats stood ready to work with the president and the republicans in a bipartisan way to have a good cafta agreement .                
0 0 we could have had over 400 votes .                                            
0 0 but they refused to put workers ' rights and environmental principals as a core part of the treaty .                      
0 0 the central american countries would have accepted that .                                          
0 0 but the u.s. rejected it .                                                
0 0 so members are smart .                                                  
0 0 they have to -- they represent their district .                                          
0 0 this is a job loser , yet again another job loser , and it also undermines the workers ' rights in central america .            
0 0 so , it 's not good for anyone .                                          
1 0 but madam leader , now as we come to this august recess , the republicans are saying they have a lot of accomplishments , whether you liked it , whether
0 0 do n't you have to admit there were some accomplishments there , whereas democrats have just been trying to oppose them in every step of the way .    
1 0 well , what i say is this has been a congress of missed opportunities and make matters worse .                      
0 0 as far as cafta is concerned , even their own members had to be strong-armed into voting for it , because it 's not the right way to go ,
0 0 today on the floor is the energy bill , which even the secretary of energy says will not lower prices at the pump for a long time to come and
0 0 as far as the transportation bill , it is a good bill .                                  
0 0 it 's two years late .                                                
1 0 what about one final issue , retirement security ?                                          
0 0 the republicans have been demanding that you put a plan on the table for months now .                          
0 0 you finally have put one on the table this week , but it does nothing to address the issue of social security solvency .            
0 0 are n't you ducking that ?                                                
1 1 no , we 're not ducking at all .                                          
0 0 democrats have said from the start , we are the protectors of social security , we will not allow privatization to undermine social security .          
0 0 we will not allow the republicans to continue to rob the social security trust fund .                            
0 0 we are about solvency .                                                  
0 0 we are about a lock box .                                              
0 0 we are about pay-as-you-go , so that the budget deficit does not drain the trust fund of it 's resources .                  
1 0 that was house minority leader nancy pelosi .                                            
0 0 coming up we 'll turn our attention to america 's space program .                                  
0 0 nasa says discovery is safe , but the rest of the shuttle fleet has been grounded .                          
0 0 a look at the latest problems and the future of space flight later on inside politics .                          
0 0 right behind me on capitol hill , members of congress are scrambling to get some big things accomplished before their august recess .              
0 0 coming up , the drive to finally pass an energy bill and what that could mean for consumers .                      
0 0 plus , is republican senator rick santorum waffling about a run for the white house ?                            
0 0 we will try to pin him down on that and on the squabbles he 's been having with some big named democrats .              
0 0 more on inside politics straight ahead .                                              
0 0 and as the markets get set to close on wall street , i am joined by christine romans in new york with `` the dobbs report . ''    
1 0 hi there , ed .                                                  
0 0 stocks ending with solid gains for the second day in a row , even though oil prices jumped to nearly $ 60 a barrel .          
0 0 let 's check the dow right now .                                            
0 0 dow jones industrial average up 69 points , 10,706 , and the nasdaq is adding half a percent .                      
0 0 united airlines parent company lost $ 1.4 billion last quarter .                                      
0 0 that 's about five times worse than a year earlier .                                      
0 0 the loss was due to massive charges for its bankruptcy reorganization , including the government take-over of united 's pension plan .                
0 0 separately , united says a threatened strike by its flight attendants is illegal , and as the company put it , will not be tolerated .        
0 0 a tough quarter for united .                                                
0 0 daimler chrysler is being steered in a new direction .                                        
0 0 the company 's long time ceo , , juergen schrempp , announced he will step down at the end of the year .              
0 0 schrempp has been under fire for failing to boost the stock price since the 1998 merger , as they called it , which he engineered between daimler benz and chrysler
0 0 but the rallied on news that he 's stepping aside , today gaining nine percent .                            
0 0 the environmental protection agency reportedly made an eleventh hour decision to withhold a report that shows a decline in auto fuel economy .              
0 0 that comes just ahead of the house vote this afternoon to pass the massive energy bill .                          
0 0 according to `` the new york times '' that report was supposed to be released today , but the epa decided , for some reason , to delay the release
0 0 the times says the report shows the 2004 model vehicle was less fuel efficient than the average new automobile back in the 1980s .            
1 0 00 p.m. eastern on `` lou dobbs tonight , '' the house passed the central american free trade agreement late last night .

1 1 thanks , christine .                                                    
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 members of the house can cross another item off their to-do list before the august recess .                          
0 0 they overwhelmingly passed a compromise energy bill today and sent it off to the senate where a vote is expected as early as tomorrow .          
0 0 republicans are calling it a good bill for america , but some democratic opponents are calling it politically and morally wrong .                
0 0 our congressional correspondent , joe johns , has more on the measure and the politics surrounding it .                        
1 0 first , the bad news .                                                
0 0 do n't expect american motorists to see much relief from high prices at the gas pump anytime soon , if congress finally finishes up work on the energy bill this
1 0 i think they need to put the gas prices down a little bit .                                
0 0 i think it 's -- it makes me mad , because it 's expensive to get gas .                        
1 0 opponents of the energy legislation are keying on consumer frustration and calling the bill , with its $ 14.5 billion in tax breaks and incentives , a gift to industry
1 1 tax breaks for big oil and gas companies .                                          
0 0 loan guarantees for the wealthiest energy companies in america , even as they are reporting the largest quarterly profits of any corporations in the history of the united states .
1 0 but in the long term , the hope is the energy bill will have an impact on the national economy by encouraging development of new energy ideas and increased uses
1 0 there are provisions in this bill that says it 's ok to use clean coal , it 's ok to build a new nuclear power plant in this country ,
1 0 the nuclear power industry is a big winner , getting new tax breaks and loan guarantees designed to rev up business .                
0 0 hybrid cars will get a boost , too .                                          
0 0 there 's a tax credit for people who buy them .                                      
0 0 the bill also promises renewed efforts to boost the use of coal , and there are provisions to modernize the electricity grid to prevent future blackouts , like the one
0 0 the bill also expands daylight saving time for one month , which proponents claim will save 100,000 barrels of oil a day .              
0 0 and the bill authorizes $ 3.5 billion for hydrogen and fuel-cell research .                                  
0 0 this is , of course , the rush to get something done before the august recess begins .                        
0 0 and if this energy bill goes through , along with cafta , the transportation bill , members of congress will be able to go home and say they did ,
0 0 it also gives the president an opportunity to chalk up a couple wins , although , as you 've already reported , ed , in the case of cafta ,
1 0 joe johns , from the capitol .                                              
0 0 thanks , joe .                                                    
0 0 we now want to turn back to texas where we 've had this developing , breaking story all afternoon .                    
0 0 we 've had an explosion that tore through a chemical plant on the north side of ft. worth .                      
0 0 you can see live pictures right there .                                            
0 0 firefighters desperately trying to put those flames out .                                          
0 0 concerns about the chemicals from that plant possibly wafting throughout that area .                                  
0 0 we now want to go to a reporter on the scene right there , jim grimes .                          
0 0 he 's a reporter with our affiliate there at ft. worth , kdaf .                                
0 0 jim , give us an idea of what you can see .                                    
1 0 well , ed , right now , obviously firefighters have their hands full .                                
0 0 you can see behind me all that black smoke going up in the air .                              
0 0 all of that chemicals that are burning , a dozen different chemicals are actually on fire inside that warehouse .                    
0 0 firefighters tell us , at this point , they 've actually stopped putting water on it .                          
0 0 there 's an explosion you can see .                                            
0 0 explosions have been coming periodically , every few minutes or so .                                    
0 0 but firefighters tell us they 're going to stop putting water on this fire , because they 're concerned that that water 's going to mix with the chemicals and
0 0 but , again , all of the smoke from this fire is also causing some big problems .                        
0 0 they 're worried that maybe some residents downwind from this are going to be affected .                            
0 0 they 've actually pushed us back several blocks , because they 're concerned about what 's in that smoke .                    
0 0 but , again , firefighters right now say they 're going to let this thing burn itself out .                      
0 0 now , we do know that this explosion actually happened about two hours ago .                              
0 0 they 're not sure exactly what caused it to happen .                                      
0 0 but several people were injured , but only minor injuries .                                      
0 0 those people were taken to a nearby hospital .                                          
0 0 they 're expected to be ok .                                              
0 0 so two stories , actually , taking place here right now , the fire itself trying to be contained and then the smoke .            
0 0 a totally different issue .                                                  
0 0 it 's also galvanized some of the traffic around this area .                                    
0 0 there 's a major highway just on the other side of this that 's right along downtown ft. worth .                    
0 0 and traffic there right now is just gridlocked .                                          
0 0 so it 's quite a mess out here , as you can imagine .                                
1 0 jim , can you give us an idea of what kind of chemicals -- have authorities said anything about what kind of chemicals they are ?        
0 0 have they been specific ?                                                  
1 1 well , they did say that there was about a dozen different chemicals .                                
0 0 what this plant does , it stores these chemicals in huge 2,000-gallon drums , phosphoric acid , some chlorine , and all types of different chemicals , all of them
0 0 so these drums that they 're in actually exploded .                                        
0 0 and that 's what we 've been seeing .                                          
0 0 and i know you 've been showing the video , some of those explosions .                              
0 0 those happen periodically .                                                    
0 0 but all the chemicals inside here extremely dangerous .                                          
1 0 thank you very much .                                                  
0 0 reporting from the scene -- stay safe -- jim grimes from our affiliate kdaf in ft. worth .                        
0 0 we will return to that story throughout the afternoon as news warrants .                                  
0 0 but back here in washington , the tit-for-tat in the senate continues over john roberts ' records , when his confirmation hearings should begin , and what is fair game
0 0 is there anything about judge roberts that can bring the left and right together ?                              
0 0 well , here 's our senior political analyst , bill schneider .                                    
1 0 the principle of judicial activism is a bad thing .                                        
0 0 that 's something everyone can agree on .                                            
0 0 it 's becoming the test for whether john roberts should be confirmed for the supreme court .                          
0 0 when president bush nominated roberts , he cited his aversion to judicial activism as a key qualification .                        
1 0 he will strictly apply the constitution and laws , not legislate from the bench .                              
1 0 conservatives have been assailing activist judges for decades for inventing new rights , like the right to privacy that conservatives argue are not in the constitution , for overruling democratically
0 0 documents from roberts ' early public service revealed that he , too , endorsed judicial restraint , something he repeated in his 2003 confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court
1 0 there 's no role for advocacy , with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge .                  
1 0 roberts does have political views , of course .                                          
1 0 i think what those files show is a young white house staffer helping to provide legal analysis and support of the president 's agenda , of president reagan 's agenda
1 0 democrats are now raising the issue of judicial activism .                                        
0 0 they argue conservative judges are rolling back abortion rights and civil rights and overturning democratically enacted laws , like environmental protection laws .              
0 0 sen. patrick leahy , vermont : an independent study -- and i referred to this earlier -- demonstrated the rehnquist court has been the most activist court in my lifetime
0 0 actually , the most activist since the new deal , before the new deal .                              
0 0 democrats want it know whether roberts will bring an ideological agenda to the supreme court .                            
1 0 he told me flatly he is not an ideologue and that he shares my aversion to ideologues .                        
1 0 at his 2003 confirmation hearings , roberts said he regarded the roe v. wade decision as , quote , `` settled law , '' but attorney general gonzales recent told
0 0 a supreme court justice is not obliged to follow precedent if you believe it 's wrong . ''                        
0 0 does that mean roberts might vote to overturn roe ?                                        
0 0 later , the justice department clarified the attorney general 's statement , calling it a purely factual statement about how our court system operates , rather than an indication of
0 0 we know roberts is a conservative .                                              
0 0 and we know he has been critical of judicial activism .                                      
0 0 which view will prevail when he goes on the supreme court ?                                    
0 0 that will be the central question at his confirmation hearings .                                      
1 0 now , bill , you 've been following these confirmation hearings , many of them over the years , whether it 's bork or thomas .        
0 0 has the standard for judicial activism changed over the years ?                                      
1 0 no , it changes -- look , for particular cases .                                      
0 0 i can remember a time when the brown decision ending school segregation was considered an activist decision .                        
0 0 and a lot of people still consider roe , that gave abortion rights , an activist decision .                        
0 0 but nowadays , if you say -- if you raise any questions about brown , or if you say you want to overturn roe , that 's considered judicial activism
1 0 ok , bill schneider , our senior political analyst , thank you .                                  
0 0 senator hillary clinton famously wrote that it takes a village .                                      
0 0 but senator rick santorum says it takes a family .                                        
0 0 up next , the republican talks about his controversial new book , his tips with democrats , and his presidential plans , maybe .            
0 0 in britain , a closing chapter in a history of terror .                                    
0 0 we 'll discuss the irish republican army 's decision to disarm .                                    
0 0 and when we go `` inside the blogs , '' find out who 's in the boy scouts ' camp online ?                
0 0 senator rick santorum is hardly a political wallflower , but he 's been making more headlines than usual as of late , by sending mixed signals about his presidential ambitions
0 0 i spoke with the pennsylvania republican today .                                            
0 0 i started by asking him why he wrote the book .                                      
1 0 i wrote the book because of the work that i 've been doing on what most people would call a compassionate conservative agenda .            
0 0 i talked to the publishers -- the eventual publishers , and they came to me and said , `` you know , you 're doing a lot of work up
0 0 it 's a different conservative vision of the role of government in people 's lives .                            
0 0 and you should really sit down and put this on paper , '' sort of put some sort of theoretical underpinnings to what the president says he wants to accomplish
0 0 so that 's how i started to write it .                                        
0 0 and i was talking to a lot of people that i 've worked with out in the field .                      
0 0 and what i found was , the more i talked to people , and the more i looked into it , the more i realized that the communities that are
0 0 and that , if we were going to really solve problems in dealing with poverty and systemic poverty in america , you ca n't ignore the family .    
0 0 in fact , it takes a family to stabilize communities , to stabilize children 's lives .                          
0 0 and so i ended up writing a much broader book , because i wanted to talk about all the societal influences on the family , both from the government ,
1 0 but do you think that , as you make those points , that maybe some of the rhetoric in the book went too far ?          
0 0 there was a `` pittsburgh post-gazette '' editorial saying , quote , `` if senator santorum wants to convert people to his brand of compassionate conservatism , he needs to
1 0 the `` pittsburgh post-gazette '' is probably one of the most hostile papers in the country toward me .                      
0 0 and i wo n't even -- the `` pittsburgh post-gazette '' is not going to be lecturing me on attitude .                  
0 0 these are folks who just criticized jon stewart on the `` daily show , '' because he was n't mean to me .              
1 0 but is it a fair point that maybe you went a little far in the rhetoric for shock value , and that that 's undermining ...        
1 1 i did n't go for shock value .                                            
0 0 most people who have interacted with me in public life and in personal life know that i try to be very honest and upfront with people .      
0 0 and i try to lay out things very clearly .                                        
0 0 and i do n't think there 's anything -- if people read this book , and i encourage people to read this book -- the more people who read this
0 0 if people read this book , they 're going to see there 's no shock value in here .                      
0 0 they may have pulled out one or two sentences out of a 440-page book and out of context they may look , you know , sort of tough , but
1 0 let 's pick out one issue , and you give us that context : abortion .                            
0 0 it 's about to be front and center in the supreme court nomination battle .                              
0 0 you write in the book -- you basically compare abortion to slavery and say that you feel that the mother has more rights than the child , just as a
0 0 a lot of people hit you over that .                                          
0 0 you have a chance now to say , what did you mean by that ?                              
1 0 here 's what i say .                                                
0 0 and if you look at slavery , what we did was say that the slave was property , was n't a person , and therefore did n't have constitutional rights
0 0 and what do we do with a child in a womb ?                                    
0 0 well , the child is either a person or it 's property .                                  
0 0 and we say that the child , under the constitution , is not a person , therefore it 's the property of the mother .          
0 0 i find that somewhat chilling that we would revisit a very ugly chapter in american history where we take a human being -- and no one denies it 's a
0 0 and that is something that we should guard against as a society , and to learn from history so we 're not revisited by what i think are cataclysmic effects
1 0 let 's talk politics .                                                  
0 0 you have a big race in pennsylvania , one of the most closely watched senate races of 2006 .                      
0 0 how is this book going to affect it ?                                          
0 0 democrats think it 's going to put you away , because they think your views are too extreme .                      
1 0 you know , if i could , i 'd buy a copy for everybody in pennsylvania and have them read it .                
0 0 and i think this is a book , if people read this book and take the time to do it , then 80 percent of pennsylvanians will say , ``
0 0 this is just pretty good common sense . ''                                          
0 0 they may not agree with every single thing that 's in the book , but 90 percent of the things that are in this book , 80 percent of pennsylvanians
0 0 i feel very comfortable that i wrote a book that 's from my heart , that talks about my vision for the people of pennsylvania in this country , and
1 0 how might this affect a potential race in 2008 ?                                        
0 0 you basically said last week that you had intention of running for president .                                
0 0 then , this week , you told the `` philadelphia enquirer , '' `` well '' ...                          
1 1 i repeated i have no intention of running for president .                                      
0 0 and i was asked the question , `` well , is there any circumstance in which you would ? ''                    
0 0 i said , `` well , it 's three years from now .                                  
0 0 to suggest that there might not be some circumstance , as remote as it might be , that i would do , i ca n't say absolutely no . ''
0 0 but i have no intention of doing it .                                          
0 0 i 'm running for reelection .                                                
0 0 i 'm running for the whip position , which is the number-two leadership position in the senate .                        
0 0 i would n't be doing that if i was going to turn around and say , `` well , see you , guys .            
0 0 i 'm going to go off to new hampshire and you 're not going to see me . ''                      
1 0 so unlikely , but a door 's open ?                                          
1 1 well , i would n't say the door 's -- i mean , ok .                              
0 0 it 's not locked and bolted , but the door itself is closed .                                
0 0 it 's just not locked .                                                
1 0 but it might be opened ?                                                
1 1 yes , well ...                                                    
1 1 thank you , senator santorum , for joining us .                                        
1 0 my pleasure .                                                      
0 0 thank you .                                                      
1 0 senator rick santorum 's door , not locked .                                          
0 0 checking the day 's `` political bytes , '' rick santorum 's not the only potential presidential hopeful making some headlines .                
0 0 senators hillary clinton and john mccain , arguably the most high-profile would- be candidates from their respective parties , are making two joint appearances today .        
0 0 this morning , they helped kick off an effort to build a new rehab center for disabled military vets .                    
0 0 tonight , they are both expected to attend the world premier of `` the great raid , '' a new film about world war ii .        
0 0 meanwhile , arkansas governor mike huckabee is the latest potential white house candidate to head for new hampshire .                      
0 0 organizers say huckabee will be the keynote speaker at next month 's stratford county republican picnic , pig roast and family night .              
0 0 next , an update on today 's announcement that the ira has renounced violence , when i talk with sinn fein leader martin mcguinness .          
0 0 also , we 'll join our blog reporters for the latest online debates over karl rove and the john roberts nomination .                
0 0 the irish republican army announced today that it will resume disarmament and that it will no longer commit acts of violence .                
0 0 gerry adams , who leads the ira 's political wing , sinn fein , called today 's announcement `` historic . ''                
0 0 but the leader of northern ireland 's dominant protestant party called the move a , quote , `` hollow gesture . ''                
0 0 the u.s. and british governments expressed cautious optimism today following the announcement .                                  
0 0 with me now to discuss today 's events is martin mcguinness .                                    
0 0 he 's the chief negotiator for sinn fein .                                          
0 0 welcome , mr. mcguinness .                                                  
1 0 thank you , ed .                                                  
1 0 i wanted to start by asking you -- we 're already hearing some skeptics say , `` we 've heard this before . ''            
0 0 why are we to believe that now the terrorism is finally over ?                                  
1 1 well , i think that there is no doubt whatsoever that what we have witnessed today is truly historic and momentous .                
0 0 and i think time will prove that to be the case .                                    
0 0 i hope that those who are skeptical will recognize that a tremendous opportunity is in the process of being created .                  
0 0 it 's one that should not be lost , because i think there is a huge responsibility , a mighty responsibility , on all political leaders to work together to
1 0 but , now , there 's been a ceasefire since 1997 .                                    
0 0 why has it taken eight years to lead to this point , where we 're finally hearing `` disarmament '' ?                  
1 1 well , it 's simply because we have been plagued by all sorts of problems and difficulties within the process .                  
0 0 we have had unionist opposition to the implementation of the good friday agreement .                                
0 0 we have had ongoing activities by unionist paramilitaries who have been attacking catholics in their homes and , of course , unionists are among the groups that have been killing
0 0 so it 's been a very , very difficult process .                                      
0 0 and now we 've seen a very decisive , but i think a very honest , move by the ira to end their armed campaign , to put their weapons
0 0 i believe them when they say they will do that .                                      
0 0 i believe them when they say that their volunteers will not be involved in any activities whatsoever .                        
0 0 and i think that we 're on the threshold of a bright new phase in irish politics .                        
1 0 now , when gerry adams came to washington for st. patrick 's day back in march , politicians like senator edward kennedy refused to meet with him because of the
0 0 you 've been going around on capitol hill today with people like congressman richard neal , other senators , as well as house members .          
0 0 what 's the reaction on the hill ?                                            
0 0 do people believe it now and really feel like the violence will end ?                                
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 i think people here do appreciate the enormous significance of what has happened today .                              
0 0 i think people are energized and enthused by this .                                        
0 0 i think that they know there is a very real possibility now of restoring the good friday institutions .                      
0 0 and , of course , as we know , the political representatives of irish america are very fervent in their beliefs that this can lead to irish reunification .  
0 0 and someone who has worked all of his life to bring about a united ireland , i think that we have before us now a process which we can all
0 0 and now the ira have signed up for that .                                        
0 0 it 's a tremendous day .                                                
1 0 mr. mcguinness , i wonder , while it seems unrelated , the recent terrorism that 's unrelated to the ira in london , did that have any effect on this
0 0 you 've seen this kind of terrorism .                                            
0 0 did that finally help push it along at all , seeing the horror of the recent terrorism in london ?                    
1 0 well , of course , we deplore what happened in london .                                    
0 0 we are totally and absolutely opposed to it .                                          
0 0 but i remind people that gerry adams made his call , his appeal to the ira on april the 6th , long before there ever were bombs in london ,
0 0 they engaged in a wide-ranging discussion themselves for recent months .                                      
0 0 and now , we 've had a conclusion of all of that .                                  
0 0 and i have to say , i , and , indeed , many others , are well-satisfied with what we 've heard today .            
0 0 and we wish to build on that to ensure the restoration of the good friday institutions .                          
1 0 now , a final question : is there a timetable for completing this disarmament , and how will it actually be verified ?              
1 1 well , i think the key person in all of this is general de chastelain , representing canada and andrew sens , a diplomat here from the united states ,
    and i am very confident that , if we leave this issue between the ira and those two particular gentlemen , that we will see a resolution of this issue
    thank you very much , martin mcguinness .                                            
    he 's the chief negotiator for sinn fein .

    now , a final question : is there a timetable for completing this disarmament , and how will it actually be verified ?              
    well , i think the key person in all of this is general de chastelain , representing canada and andrew sens , a diplomat here from the united states ,

1 1 turning back to domestic politics , the cia leak investigation is keeping the blogosphere very busy .                          
0 0 let 's check in with cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner , our blog reporter -- jacki ?                    
0 0 hi , ed .                                                    
0 0 well , in an investigation where the special prosecutor has pretty much asked everyone to keep quiet , what little we are finding out is plenty to keep the conversation
0 0 but as mark in mexico points out -- this is markinmexico.blogspot.com -- `` it is not the people at the center of the inquiry itself who are doing much of
0 0 and the whole thing is becoming very circus-like . ''                                        
0 0 the latest act coming from the huffington post .                                          
0 0 you might remember , this is the group blog where lawrence o'donnell first posted that karl rove was matt cooper 's source .              
1 0 though , that little tidbit turned out to be true , today 's over at the huffington post is by arianna herself .              
0 0 and this is her using conjecture to connect the dots .                                      
0 0 and in this information vacuum , the focus of speculation on the web seems to change daily .                        
0 0 some days it 's ari fleischer .                                              
0 0 some days it 's scooter libby .                                              
0 0 some days it 's karl rove .                                              
0 0 in fact , most of the time it 's karl rove .                                    
0 0 but today , a lot of the speculation seems to be centered around judith miller , the `` new york times '' reporter and what involvement she had , what
0 0 now , of course , this is all speculation .                                        
0 0 we do n't know the facts .                                              
0 0 judith miller is spending her 22nd day in prison .                                        
0 0 she is not talking about this .                                              
0 0 but other bloggers are .                                                  
0 0 they are talking about this post .                                              
1 0 it really is doing the rounds .                                              
0 0 they 're talking about it on the left and the right .                                    
0 0 kevin drum over at political animal at the `` washington monthly '' references the second of two nuggets that have come out today .            
0 0 arianna 's theory being the first of those two , and then a `` new york times '' article putting forth the theory that there may be a third white
1 1 he urges caution , says this is all speculation .                                        
0 0 we will do the same .                                                
0 0 yes , that 's the rove story .                                            
0 0 there 's a lot of talk on that , but there 's a lot of talk also on another washington story this summer in the blogosphere , and that is
0 0 there 's been lots of questions asked online , lots of people putting forward ideas that the judiciary committee members should be asking in those nomination hearings when they happen
0 0 well , a group of senators today has put together a web site so people can go online and ask those questions , led by senator barbara mikulski of maryland
0 0 you can go to her site , click through here to the button that says , `` it 's your supreme court . ''            
0 0 and you can say , `` what would you ask judge roberts ? ''                                
0 0 fill in your name , ask your question , and forward it to this group of senators .                        
1 1 they 'll be monitoring the questions as they come in , and the questions will form the material they send forward to the judiciary committee .        
0 0 so this is a group of senators here , engaging people online , letting them join in the nomination process -- ed ?              
0 0 thank you , abbi and jacki .                                              
0 0 the `` strategy session '' is straight ahead on inside politics .                                    
0 0 today , president bush goes the extra mile to capitol hill and it was just enough .                          
0 0 cafta , what went down in the middle of the night and what 's the political fallout ?                        
0 0 when we come back .                                                  
0 0 welcome back to inside politics and our `` strategy session '' in today 's hottest political topics .                        
0 0 with us today , democratic strategist vic kamber and cnn political analyst robert novak .                              
0 0 today 's topics , wheeling and dealing , now that the trade pact has swept through the congress on some high profile lobbying , will it pay off as the
0 0 judging roberts .                                                      
1 0 the questionnaire arrives , and the supreme court nominee faces a grilling by senators , even before his hearings start .                  
1 0 and the central american free trade agreement is bound for president bush 's desk after overnight house action .                      
0 0 the yeas are 217 , the nays are 215 , the bill has passed .                              
0 0 president bush is getting much of the credit for the trade bill 's two-vote passage .                            
0 0 mr. bush paid a rare visit to capitol hill yesterday , had vice president cheney there , as well , lobbying .                
0 0 the high powered wheeling and dealing apparently paid off .                                        
1 0 but will cafta pay off for the u.s. ?                                          
0 0 vic , i wonder from a strategy standpoint , having the president put so much political capital on the line and go there yesterday on the hill , rare visit
0 0 no , frankly , he needed a win .                                          
0 0 it 's not been a good year for the president since his election .                                
0 0 the best part for him was the election , and , frankly , it 's been downhill since then in many ways .              
0 0 he needed a win .                                                  
0 0 this was an important piece of legislation for him .                                        
0 0 i think -- to have prestige and power and not use it is ridiculous .                              
0 0 he used his prestige and his power .                                            
1 0 i question some of the tactics .                                              
1 0 but he used it and he was very effective .                                        
0 0 bob , does it show him to be a little bit weak that he put out that much effort ?                    
0 0 no , i agree with vic , it 's a big plus for him .                              
0 0 these trade bills remind me a little bit of professional wrestling , because the president , whichever party , always wins .                
0 0 he wins by a little bit .                                              
0 0 there 's always all of this dramatic thing in the middle of the night with congressmen being given highways and goodness knows what else .          
1 0 and they always squeak through .                                                
0 0 and i just said earlier in the year when they were 30 , 40 points behind , he 'll win that .                
0 0 now it 's funny you mention those highways .                                          
1 0 today the house minority leader nancy pelosi basically charged that there may have been bribery on the house floor and suggested there was more than that .      
0 0 let 's take a listen to what she said .                                        
0 0 i do know of a report that had been made to me about offers that were made to democrats and they came running in , saying -- did n't sound
0 0 but they know what they 've done .                                            
1 0 and they know it 's at additional cost to the u.s. taxpayer .                                  
0 0 you should ask them .                                                  
1 0 bob , you 've been in this town a long time .                                    
0 0 does it pass the legal muster or is it just business as usual .                                
0 0 nancy reminds me of the guy in casablanca , you know , shocking there 's gambling going on here .                    
0 0 they 've been doing that for a long time .                                        
0 0 the interesting thing is not that .                                              
0 0 that 's all sad .                                                  
0 0 the interesting thing is there was 17 democratic votes for a trade bill .                                
0 0 democratic party is now the protectionist party .                                            
1 0 the traditional party of andrew jackson , free trade , has been moving that way for years and it 's there now .              
0 0 it 's the protectionist party which is not a winning formula in america .                                
0 0 vic , how about that , and the fact that organized labor was trying to show some muscle in telling democrats on the hill , you better not vote for
1 0 and then , as bob notes , a lot of democrats did vote for it and it passed .                      
0 0 organized labor , after this crack up at the afl-cio , is there clout waning .                            
0 0 well , first of all , a lot of democrats did n't vote for it .                            
0 0 yes , i mean , the numbers are very small .                                      
0 0 and i think some of those democrats will have a high price to pay in terms of trying to get future support from some of those labor unions .  
0 0 i think the unions will hold back some money and some support .                                  
0 0 some of those democrats , frankly , were marginal to begin with .                                  
0 0 having said that , you know , it was clearly a lobbyist bill this one , republicans won .                      
0 0 the president won .                                                    
1 0 everybody else lost , meaning labor and whoever else was on the other side .                              
0 0 you have to give the president his due .                                          
0 0 and , bob , was a lot on the line for the president here ?                              
1 0 i mean , it seemed like a small trade deal .                                      
0 0 but was it the fact that he 's having so much trouble on social security and other issues that he had to get a win ?        
0 0 it 's prestige .                                                    
0 0 it was small to you but it was big to central america .                                  
0 0 i met with the president of nicaragua two weeks ago -- was in town .                              
0 0 he 's about ready to get impeached .                                            
0 0 he 's fighting the sandonistas .                                                
0 0 he 's got all hell to pay and all he could talk about was this trade agreement .                        
1 0 it 's a big deal in central america .                                          
0 0 all those governments , various kinds of governments , wanted it .                                    
0 0 now what about some of the back room deals ?                                        
0 0 you 've been tracking the story of republican charley taylor .                                      
1 0 he apparently tried to vote no , but the machine did n't pick it up .                            
0 0 do you know a little bit about that .                                          
0 0 charley taylor was against it .                                                
0 0 his vote was n't recorded and he says he actually voted .                                    
0 0 he comes from a north carolina republican district .                                          
0 0 he 's supposed to be very marginal .                                            
0 0 he wins by about 54 , 56 percent of the vote .                                    
0 0 but he gave the dog ate my homework excuse , and that is that he put his card in and it did n't work .          
0 0 but there was one other person who did n't vote , joann davis from virginia .                            
1 0 and she had gone to the boy scout jamboree and she got caught in suburban traffic and could n't get back .                
0 0 now is n't that the great excuse for not voting , i got caught in traffic .                          
1 0 now , vic , just to wrap it up though .                                      
0 0 bill clinton never offered up bridges to get nafta , for example , in 1993 ?                            
0 0 not that i 'm aware of .                                              
0 0 i 'm like bob .                                                  
0 0 we know those things happen .                                                
0 0 i hope nancy 's wrong , frankly , i hope that she 's wrong and it did n't go over the bounds of ethics .          
1 0 i mean , but the bottom line is , the country is split , the congress is split , and you do what you have to do .    
0 0 hopefully within the law .

0 0 president bush 's supreme court nominee is still turning on the charm with more visits to capitol hill .                      
0 0 on his schedule today , sitdowns with democratic senators ben nelson and mary landrieu .                              
0 0 roberts yesterday received a 10 page questionnaire in advance of his confirmation hearings .                                
0 0 senate democrats are demanding documents .                                                
1 0 and others have launched a web site to post questions to roberts .                                  
0 0 one republican senator says he 's concerned some are trying to turn roberts confirmation into a political circus .                      
1 0 after recent media reports , i 've become concerned that some of those fears i spoke of earlier on this floor are coming true .          
0 1 namely , that our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to do everything they can to obstruct the confirmation process of the president 's nominee to
0 0 how about it , vic ?                                                
0 0 the last couple of days , we 've started hearing democrats raising questions about when the hearings are going to start , how many pages of documents are going to
1 1 is it smart for the democrats to be picking these little fights ?                                  
0 0 or should they just get on board ?                                            
0 0 well , i 'm a believer it 's smart for republicans or democrats to make sure they know what they 've got in this package .        
0 0 we 're talking about a man who 's 50 years of age with , hoping he has health -- he could be on that court for 25 , 30 years
0 0 i do n't think anything 's out of bounds in terms of finding out as much about him , what he believes , what he stands for , as possible
1 0 i would expect from what we know already , he 's going to be confirmed it looks like .                      
1 0 but i think the democrats would be ill served -- i as a democrat would be ill served if those politicians and democrats on the senate do n't ask all
0 0 how about it , bob , are they out in left field on this ?                              
0 0 it 's a waste of time .                                              
0 0 vic is right the first time , he 's going to be confirmed .                                
0 0 this is the worst nightmare for democrats .                                            
0 0 just go back a month .                                                
0 0 they thought that rehnquist was going to go and you put one conservative in for another conservative .                        
0 0 but sandra day o'connor was a liberal judge on social questions .                                    
0 0 she really was .                                                    
0 0 and she was the swing vote on a lot of questions .                                    
0 0 and here they have named another scalia .                                            
0 0 he is another scalia .                                                  
0 0 people who served with him on the d.c. court of appeals .                                    
0 0 but he 's a soft spoken scalia .                                            
0 0 that 's why he 's a nightmare .                                            
0 0 he 's not going to say anything stupid .                                          
0 0 and there 's no way to get at him .                                        
1 0 and you know , i love the story today ben nelson , kind of a pompous conservative democrat from nebraska says he told him he 's not going to be
1 0 now can you imagine going into roberts , i 'm going to be an activist judge .                          
1 0 how about it , vic .                                                
0 0 and once he 's on that court , there 's nothing can touch him .                              
0 0 and that 's the point .                                                
0 0 i mean , i think bob said is correctly .                                        
0 0 once he 's on the court , there 's nothing can touch him .                                
0 0 so , i think we have an obligation , win or not , you know , let 's assume he 's going to be confirmed .        
0 0 i still want to know about him .                                            
0 0 i still want to know this country to know about him .                                    
1 0 i think the senate has an obligation to know about him .                                    
1 0 and in the end , if he comes out as clean as bob is projecting and the president is projecting , he 'll win .          
1 0 but there are fair questions , and there are fair questions , and then there are questions that are out of bounds .              
0 0 like what ?                                                      
0 0 republicans are suggesting that the question from democrat dick durbin last friday when he allegedly asked judge roberts whether or not his catholic faith would have any effect on his
0 0 and in fact , a letter just went out from , obviously , long-time catholic henry hyde , republican congressman , we all know him .        
0 0 he wrote it to dick durbin saying , quote , `` practicing catholics need not apply , can not become a rallying cry of modern day religious bigots who would
1 1 i hope that your question to judge roberts , if accurately reported , does not constitute an opening salvo in a process in which the candidate 's faith will constitute
0 0 fair or not to ask about his catholic faith ?                                        
0 0 well , i think it 's important that we have elected officials , politicians , judges who are of faith .                  
0 0 and i think that -- i commend judge roberts for his faith .                                  
0 0 now , is out of bounds to ask somebody where they put their faith against the laws of our land ?                  
0 0 i do n't know .                                                  
1 0 i mean , you know , we went through this in '60 with kennedy .                              
0 0 i 'm not a catholic .                                                
0 0 republicans during the clinton administration had asked ruth bader ginsberg whether her jewish faith would affect her decision , do you think democrats would have been screaming about that ?
0 0 kamber : well , they would have been screaming , but we 're talking about -- it depends what they would have asked .            
1 0 i 'm saying in the catholic church , and bob may be better to talk about it -- in the catholic church .              
0 0 let 's give bob 15 seconds .                                              
0 0 this is a tremendous blunder by senator durbin , absolutely a huge blunder for him to say that .                      
0 0 and it is a -- it 's a huge mistake .                                      
0 0 people are talking about it .                                                
0 0 it 's the second mistake he 's made in two weeks .                                    
0 0 and you just do n't say things like that .                                        
0 0 it happened in the green room at nbc .                                          
0 0 a lot of bad things happen in green rooms .                                        
1 0 you 've never been in the green room .                                          
1 1 but i 'm telling you , people think they 're soundproof in there and they say dumb things .                      
0 0 but is n't the faith question , do n't we need to know where he puts his faith against the law ?                
1 0 no .                                                        
0 0 i 'll tell you what that is , that is absolutely inexcusable , and over the line .

0 0 coming up at the top of the hour , one week after the july 21st bombing attempts in london , police are still looking for three of the four suspects
0 0 the discovery space shuttle docks with the international space station , but new findings revive serious concerns about shuttle safety .                  
0 0 and millions of americans use echinacea to fight colds , but does it really work ?                            
1 0 all those stories and much more just minutes away on `` wolf blitzer reports . ''                            
0 0 for now though , back to inside politics .                                          
1 0 nasa 's announcement that the discovery crew is safe , but space shuttle flights have been grounded is the latest challenge for scientists planning future space exploration .    
1 0 cnn 's bruce morton has more on how the space program is struggling to remain relevant in the eyes of the american public .            
0 0 three , two , one .                                                
0 0 it looked splendid leaving the launch pad , all 2 million parts of it , cost about half a billion dollars per mission , 4,000 workers at the kennedy space
0 0 but , it 's elderly , it 's technology goes back to the 1970s before ipods , before blackberries .                    
0 0 you get the idea .                                                  
0 0 and then it turned out some foam had come loose from the external fuel tank , a problem similar to the one that destroyed columbia .        
1 0 discovery has docked with the space station and is apparently unharmed .                                    
0 0 but the shuttles are grounded again .                                              
0 0 the team has worked hard , very hard , for two-and-a-half years to get the tank to be absolutely as clean as it can be .        
1 0 we missed this one .                                                  
0 0 we 'll fix it before we fly again .                                          
0 1 two-and-a-half years and you have n't fixed this ?                                          
1 0 embarrassment ?                                                        
0 0 oh yes .                                                      
1 0 i think it 's hard to overstate just how big a disappointment this is to nasa .                          
1 0 after a couple of years of work and more than a couple hundred million dollars , they still have the same problems that they had when columbia launched .  
1 0 the shuttles are supposed to last until 2010 , but exactly what will replace them is n't clear .                      
0 0 right now , we 're planning on flying the shuttle until 2010 using it to assemble the international space station and then moving on with a return of u.s. astronauts
1 0 and the space station is behind schedule and over budget .                                      
0 0 and who knows how long this new delay may be ?                                      
0 0 i think it 's a little premature to start talking about retiring the shuttle early .                            
0 0 but i do think it 's a big question as far as when they 're going to be able to fly the shuttle again .          
1 0 i do n't see any way that the mission scheduled for september aboard atlantis can fly right now .                      
0 0 in fact , most people seem to think they 're done for at least the rest of 2005 .                      
1 0 and that may make it harder to sell the program to congress and the public .                            
0 0 a cnn/usa today/gallup poll last month showed three out of five americans oppose manned flights to mars .                        
1 0 the president 's grand plans for manned exploration of mars seem to most americans to be out of sync with the real problems they confront in their everyday lives .
0 0 and this setback is certainly going to contribute to that sentiment .                                    
0 0 discovery seems to have survived its launch in good safe shape .                                    
1 1 you ca n't say that for the space program as a whole .

0 0 they say they were promising their readers lots of photos as they came down of the event .                        
0 0 but the photos show that nothing went as planned .                                        
0 0 they showed that the scouts were being sprayed with water as the heat rose , the temperatures rose in the afternoon .                
0 0 and then later on , the ambulance coming to treat the victims of heat related illnesses there .

0 0 she saw people lying on the ground being treated .                                        
0 0 we have one boy scout who is blogging for his hometown paper .                                  
0 0 this is lloyd fouler , he 's an 8th grader , 14-years-old .                                  
0 0 and he says that today , luckily , it is much cooler .

    senator tim kaine is everything donald trump and mike pence are not .                                  
    the democrats hope their a-list convention halts any donald trump momentum .                                    
0 0 and more chaos , this time at a munich shopping mall .                                    
0 0 will it bolster trump 's case for change ?                                          
1 0 this is the legacy of hillary clinton : death , destruction , terrorism and weakness .                            
1 0 plus , why this morning rant has some republicans worried .                                      
1 0 i like ted .

0 0 again , i do n't want his endorsement .

0 0 we are live tonight from the democratic convention hall in the great city of philadelphia .                            
0 0 three questions as hillary clinton gets her big stage right here in this hall and as donald trump shifts from convention to general election .          
0 0 number one , can clinton use the spotlight to ease concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness or is she too well known to win a fresh look ?    
1 0 instead of the fear and the anger and the resentment , the lack of any solutions to help working families get ahead or keep our country safe , i sense
1 0 here is question two : what difference will tim kaine make ?                                    
0 0 his home state of virginia is a cherished electoral prize and clinton hopes her running mate is also a not so secret weapon in florida and other states where latinos
1 1 the first 100 days , we 'll put forward a comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a path to citizenship .                  
1 0 get ready for a lot of that .                                            
1 0 is donald trump his own worst enemy ?                                            
0 0 his convention speech was a call to law and order but instead of a singular focus on clinton , he seems at time much more interested in his war of
1 0 all i did is point out the fact that on the cover of the `` national enquirer '' , there was a picture of him and crazy lee harvey oswald
1 1 priceless .                                                        
0 0 with us to share their reporting and their insights , jonathan martin of the `` new york times , '' maeve reston of cnn , julie pace of `` the
0 0 hillary clinton steps into the history books this week .                                        
0 0 right here in philadelphia , the first woman to lead a major party ticket in the united states , but first woman president is her higher goal .    
0 0 in the days ahead here , more than critical .                                        
0 0 donald trump is gaining ground in many key battleground states and his call for law and order and big change in washington just might fit the country 's mood .
0 0 so , clinton 's mission is clear , paint trump as a risk america ca n't afford to take .                    
1 0 donald trump may think america is in decline but he 's wrong .                                  
0 0 america 's best days are still ahead of us , my friends .                                  
0 0 and when he says , as he did say , `` i alone can fix it , '' he 's not only wrong , he 's dangerously wrong .  
0 0 we americans , we solve problems together .                                            
0 0 and if donald does n't                                                  
0 0 understand that , he does n't understand america .                                          
1 0 and with help from her friends , clinton hopes , including her new vice presidential running mate , to ask you take another look , rethink your doubts about her
1 1 i 'm a catholic and hillary is a methodist , but i tell you her creed is the same as mine -- do all the good you can .  
0 0 pretty simple .                                                      
0 0 do all the good you can .                                              
0 0 give service to one another .                                                
0 0 now , that 's a notion that americans of every faith tradition and every moral tradition believe in and it 's a message that hillary clinton has taken to heart
1 0 let 's start with the kaine pick .                                            
0 0 that 's the big thing in the news .                                          
0 0 jeff , you were at the announcement yesterday , this fits both of the goals .                            
0 0 hillary clinton said she wanted a governing choice , someone she could work with in the white house .                      
0 0 she remembers the dysfunction with al gore back in the bill clinton days , but let 's be honest , this is also a political choice , not just a
0 0 virginia is important but those spanish language skills in florida , new mexico , nevada , colorado , and beyond .                  
0 0 it 's an observation , but when he was speaking yesterday -- she looked happy .                            
0 0 you do n't see her that happy on the campaign trail that much .                                
1 0 she absolutely did .                                                    
0 0 as she was sitting back in her stool watching him speak , she had a look on her that i 'm not sure i have seen yet on the campaign
0 0 it was a different look than a couple weeks earlier in charlotte when president obama was trying to make the case for her .            
1 0 she has been in politics so long , she has been a partner so many times , but now , this is her partner .          
0 0 she owns this relationship and looked so happy in that choice .                                    
0 0 you 're right about tim kaine .                                              
0 0 they hope he is the full package .                                            
0 0 yes , he is a governor , he is a senator , even a mayor , lieutenant governor .                      
0 0 he has the insider credentials in this anti-establishment year , but the spanish speaking is key .                          
0 0 but he also has something more , his optimism as he was speaking there .                              
0 0 they believe that he , in fact , is a good communicator .                                  
0 0 a lot of talk about , oh , he is no boring .                                  
0 0 he did n't look boring to me yesterday .                                          
0 0 that crowd in miami yesterday did not think he was boring at all .                                
0 0 they believe that he will be a sunny side up addition to this ticket here .                            
0 0 now , on the margins we will see if he can help her honesty and trustworthiness , but the spanish language skills , he is not up there reading a
0 0 this is real for him .                                                
1 0 and just as a very practical matter he would be on spanish language television every day and will be between now and the november election and the influence of that
1 1 right .                                                        
0 0 especially , again , if you could take florida 's 29 away from donald trump his path to the presidency is incredibly hard .            
1 1 and virginia .                                                      
1 1 and virginia .                                                      
0 1 you take , what is it eight in virginia ?                                        
1 1 thirteen .                                                        
1 1 thirteen in virginia , 29 in florida , then trump has to go pennsylvania across to wisconsin .                        
0 0 what about the politics of this ?                                              
0 0 bernie sanders , i do n't believe he said a word yet .                                  
0 0 donald trump was on twitter this morning saying it 's disrespectful to bernie , that this is n't progressive enough .                  
1 0 i think we certainly can expect donald trump to keep trying to pump that up .                            
0 0 there is from the folks that i 've talked to in the bernie sanders camp there is a lot of disappointment about that .            
0 0 it 's not like anyone was actually really expecting it , but there were so many of his supporters who did not like hillary clinton , had trust issues with
1 0 but hillary clinton thinks she has enough space here delegate- wise and , b , that donald trump will motivate the liberals even if they are mad about tim kaine
0 1 the question is , the vice presidential , what 's his role , right ?                              
0 0 people do n't vote for vice president but he is important on the campaign trail .                            
0 0 here is a little flavor of tim kaine attack dog .                                      
1 0 when donald trump says he has your back , you better watch out .                                
0 0 from atlantic city to his so-called university , he leaves a trail of broken promises .                            
0 0 hillary clinton is the direct opposite of donald trump .                                        
0 0 she does n't insult people , she listens to them .                                      
0 0 she does n't trash our allies , she respects them .                                      
0 0 and she will always have our backs .                                            
1 0 again , you see her in the background , she is just lit up .                              
0 0 she 's happy , this is her big day , so she 's happy .                              
0 0 trump again trying to stoke what we were just talking about .                                    
0 0 he 's on `` meet the press '' this morning and he says of tim kaine he 's in favor of tpp , that 's trans pacific partnership , a
0 0 the trade issue has been important for trump .                                          
0 0 does it matter in this selection of kaine ?                                          
1 0 i think that you 're going to see tim kaine move away from tpp .                              
0 0 the clinton campaign has already signaled that saying in the course of their private discussions that he said that he agrees with hillary clinton that the tpp deal in its
0 0 whether that will be enough to ease the kind of anxiety among the bernie supporters , i do n't know , but it is just fascinating to watch the democratic
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
1 0 a popular one , too .                                                
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 labor organizations for the most part yesterday , their public statements were supportive of kaine .                            
0 0 let 's move to hillary clinton 's big challenge when she takes the stage and the other speakers this week , including the president of the united states , to
0 0 trump essentially said we 're in chaos , we 're in crisis , here at home and abroad , and that this administration , the current president and his former
0 0 what does hillary clinton do to say , no , i get it and here is how i 'm different from you , but convince people out there who think
1 0 it 's her big challenge , i think .                                          
0 0 a , they want to reset the sort of the national dialogue here that things are n't in disaster , things are n't in decline , and president obama does
0 0 he 's coming to this convention at a much higher place than he was four years ago in terms of his standing , but it is still a challenge for
0 0 so , she 's tried to thread the needle , i think she will do that again on thursday night , but that is the sole challenge here .  
0 0 i think tim kaine helps with that .                                            
0 0 his story , you know -- the son of a welder , other things , he seems to be more in touch with the real america than her .  
0 0 she has been in public life for so long , it is hard for her to express that she is fighting for you .            
1 1 one fast observation , too --                                                
1 1 yesterday , i was out talking to swing voters in the philly suburbs about trump 's speech and the contrast with clinton 's message , and they are not right
0 0 and i think that that is a huge challenge to see whether that message works for her because what i 've heard out there and what we 've all been
0 0 the problem for trump is that people out there think -- hey have no idea what he 's going to do .                
0 0 they just have the perception that he would be stronger .                                      
1 0 not a lot of policy attached to his tough talk in cleveland .                                  
0 0 i think it 's one of the deficiencies of the republican convention .                                  
0 0 the question is , democrats want a huge risk in they say it 's a problem , not a crisis .                  
0 0 let 's show some polling in some of these swing state senate races , that showed before the convention , trump was on the move , closing in or pulling
1 1 yes , there is no question about it , that i think a pattern of terrorism is going to keep trump competitive in this race , especially in states that
0 0 talking to folks yesterday about the campaign , it was striking talking to republicans and i think that 's going to be one of the key groups this year are
0 0 talking to that kind of group yesterday that 's on the fence , the kaine pick makes them feel better .                  
0 0 it makes them feel like , ok , maybe i can do the clinton vote because kaine seems to be a pretty decent normal mainstream guy .      
1 0 it 's not just munich and other things .                                          
0 0 the democrats i was talking to this week , senators and others who are worried about where the party is right now on security issues here at home , too
0 0 that 's a fine line she needs to walk , as well , supporting the police , as well as acknowledging the other issues out there .      
0 0 democrats are worried that the party --                                              
0 1 exactly .                                                        
0 0 that 's a fine line .                                                
1 1 fine line for her .                                                  
0 0 again , much for to talk about here .                                          
0 0 next , clinton 's convention wish list .                                            
0 0 cleveland was a clinton prosecution , here in philadelphia , you might say the defense gets its turn .                      
0 0 first , though , politicians say or sing the darndest things .                                    
0 0 president obama , he has al green , right ?                                        
0 0 you 've seen him singing `` let 's stay together '' , but the first lady she 's got music royalty , queen b .          
1 0 this is the white house and we 're passing the rose garden as you see here .                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 this is the oval office .                                                
0 0 my husband is in there somewhere .                                              
1 0 is he in there right now ?                                              
1 0 he better be , that 's where he said he was .                                    
1 1 i mean , beyonce .                                                  
1 0 what can we say ?                                                  
1 1 we were fully in the beehive .                                              
1 0 we just dropped the mike .                                                
1 0 did n't we ?                                                    
1 0 we were making honey there in the life .                                          
1 0 we were in the beehive .                                                
1 1 we were making honey to put in our lemonade .                                        
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 we 're live this morning from the democratic convention hall in philadelphia .                                  
0 0 the biggest obstacle to hillary clinton winning the white house might not be donald trump .                            
0 0 it could be what most of you think about hillary clinton .                                    
0 0 look at these numbers , 65 percent of americans say no when asked if she 's honest .                        
0 0 and just shy of six in ten doubt she is sincere in what she says .                            
0 0 because of those bad numbers , just about every speaker here in philadelphia will ask you to take a fresh look , including her running mate .      
1 0 these are tough times for many in our country , but we 're tough people and that 's something else i learned from my folks , tough times do n't
0 0 and they do n't come any tougher or any more compassionate than hillary clinton .                              
1 0 can she change this ?                                                  
0 0 this is like an albatross around her neck .                                          
0 0 she 's been in public life for a very long time .                                    
0 0 when you 've been in public life for so long , it 's hard to change these numbers .                      
0 0 and then she recently had the fbi director essentially say , you know , maybe she 's going to get the job of president , but if she applied for
1 0 if you go out and talk to voters , democratic voters , who want to vote for her , who may actually vote for her , you hear this over
0 0 they do n't trust her .                                                
0 0 they feel like she is out for herself , that the clintons play with different rules and they 've felt that way for a long time .      
0 0 how you change that perception especially in light of what happened with the fbi director i think is going to be a huge challenge to her .      
0 0 it just underscores the fact that the clinton campaign completely underestimated the legs that the e-mail controversy had and did n't get ahead of it .        
0 0 when you show her comments at the u.n. press conference last year and line them up with what she said throughout the year and james comey said , it 's
1 0 it 's so interesting because we waited and waited , that the big complaints from trump allies was that he was not using the fbi director 's words like he
0 0 he finally did that in his speech last week and his advisors are hoping to keep him on a much more steady focus , to just keep driving that message
1 0 so , she has honesty and integrity character questions , she also has problems on the issues .                        
0 0 yes , if you look at the national polls , she 's a little ahead .                            
0 0 if you go state by state , she 's ahead in the path to 270 , if you will , although i said some polling last week -- at the
0 0 and then , look at the issues , look at the issues .                                  
0 0 donald trump leads                                                      
0 0 her in our latest poll by eight points on the economy .                                    
0 0 almost always issue number one in presidential elections .                                          
0 0 donald trump leads her by six points on the issue of terrorism .                                  
0 0 donald trump leads her by 13 points on who would best handle isis .                                
0 0 you see hillary clinton 's advantages more broadly on foreign policy , on health care , on abortion rights and race relations , but if this is an election about
1 0 it definitely does .                                                    
0 0 i think what she has to hope is that voters in november look at this not as an issues election but as a temperament election and say that because things
0 0 trump is a much bigger risk .                                              
0 0 that is the fundamental question in this election , risk versus steadiness .                                  
1 0 this election can not be about hillary clinton if she is so win .                                
0 0 she has to basically render him unacceptable .                                            
0 0 and if she does that , then she 'll win .                                      
0 0 but it is -- it 's going to be tough for her .                                  
0 0 you know , the reason why this race still as competitive as it is in large part is because of her own negatives .            
0 0 given trump 's historic unpopularity , this should not be that competitive of a race .                            
1 0 in addition to the security challenge , when you see her down eight points in the economy , trump is for change , i will change washington , i 'm
1 1 no .                                                        
1 0 although ivanka added -- ivanka suggested some policies , but we will get to that in a minute .                      
0 0 what is hillary clinton 's economic message if you had to put it on a bumper sticker ?                        
0 0 does n't she have to -- i do n't know what she 's for .                              
1 0 it 's basically , again , what jonathan is saying , saying that donald trump is unacceptable .                        
0 0 and the interesting thing about these numbers is , there 's already millions and millions , tens of millions of dollars in television advertising from the clinton campaign and democrats
0 0 that clearly has n't worked at least as of this point in terms of the economy .                          
1 1 i 'm not sure they wo n't care about that when they start seeing                                
0 0 ads in ohio and ads in pennsylvania .                                            
1 1 but they have already been up , though , on the air .                                  
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 so , the question , will advertising work in this campaign like it has before ?                            
0 0 it did n't in the primary .                                              
0 0 of course , this is a different audience here .                                        
0 0 but that 's one worry that will be in this hall .                                    
0 0 is donald trump sort of , you know , oblivious to -- or protected from all this normal types of advertising ?                
1 1 and sometimes we have been seeing really strange reactions to ads against donald trump .                              
0 0 you know , at ucla , they 've been watching the differences and seeing a backlash sometimes when his voice is used in a pro-hillary ad .      
0 0 so that will be , i think , the most fascinating thing to watch this fall .                          
1 0 it 's interesting .                                                    
0 0 i mean , she has a long list , to their credit the democrats have been more specific on policy .                  
0 0 you do n't have to agree with it if you 're watching at home .                              
0 0 to their credit , they have laid out more plans than donald trump has .                              
0 0 however , i do n't know if you 're trying to put it under an umbrella , what is , it fighting for you , on your side .  
0 0 you do n't get that from hillary clinton .                                          
0 0 but let me ask one other question about what 's going to happen here .                              
0 0 bernie sanders was the runner up , bernie sanders has come around and he endorsed hillary clinton .                        
0 0 he said nice things .                                                  
0 0 donald trump reached out to bernie sanders voters and bernie sanders went on twitter and essentially said , sorry , pal , you sound like a dictator to me ,
0 0 now , coming into this convention , you have this wikileaks thing about the dnc e-mails where it appears , if these e-mails are authentic , that a whole lot
1 0 there was gambling in the casino , john ?                                          
0 0 i 'm shocked to hear that .                                              
0 0 look , of course , the dnc was for hillary the entire time .                                
0 0 president obama was for hillary the entire time .                                          
0 0 we all knew that .                                                  
0 0 there was nobody who was , you know , actually supporting bernie sanders in the democratic party establishment .                      
0 0 the problem is , though , they pretended like they were neutral .                                  
0 0 i                                                          
0 0 do n't get that .                                                  
0 0 i mean , just be honest about what your preference is .                                    
0 0 we think that she has the best chance for us to win , we are for her .                        
0 0 instead , they played this game of saying , no , you know , we 're not taking sides .                    
0 0 everybody knew that that was not the case , but they did that for an entire year plus , and now , lo and behold , we get e-mails that
1 1 so , the chairperson does n't get to speak .                                        
0 0 they denied her the right to speak .                                            
0 0 but you were at that event yesterday , she spoke before hillary clinton .                                
0 0 hillary clinton praised her .                                                  
0 0 that 's poking the sanders people in the eye .                                        
1 0 yes , and as soon as she praised her , there was a bit of a protest going on .                    
0 0 so , that was why debbie wasserman schultz is not going to be speaking from that podium .                        
0 0 it 's extraordinary .                                                    
0 0 the chairwoman of a party in a historic ticket where the potential first woman president of the united states , the chairwoman of the party is going to gavel in
0 0 she would be treated like ted cruz or worse on this floor .                                  
0 0 so , you know , it 's damning .                                          
1 0 it 's also that , i mean , i 'm not sure we will see , you know , people standing on chairs at this convention the way that we
0 0 but it really , as the timing of it , to stoke the anger of those bernie sanders supporters who are really disappointed and felt like the system was really
1 0 that 's the point .                                                  
0 0 that the rigged system i think is really the key to this because bernie supporters --                            
1 0 that was the message .                                                  
1 0 -- are n't going to line up with donald trump on a lot of issues , trade maybe .                      
0 0 but they can line up behind him in the sense that the political system is rigged and we have to overhaul it .              
1 0 one of the strongest argument you can have in this election , change a broken washington .                          
0 0 trump says only he can do it .                                            
0 0 i do n't know .                                                  
0 0 we will see how that one goes .                                            
0 0 up next , the democrats say donald trump 's convention message was dark , dismal , depressing .                        
0 0 but is he in touch with your mood right now ?                                      
0 0 but , first , please take our inside politics quiz this morning , which trump child would you most like to see run for public office .      
0 0 don jr. , ivanka , eric or tiffany ?                                          
0 0 tell us now at cnn.com/vote .                                                
0 0 the party that controls the white house gets the last word in presidential conventions .                              
1 0 counter donald trump 's convention call to arms .                                          
1 0 together we will lead our party back to the white house and we will lead our country back to safety , prosperity and peace .          
0 0 we will be a country of generosity and warmth , but we will also be a country of law and order .                
1 0 now , a lot of critics found that speech dark , even alarmist , but trump is making a bet .                  
0 0 two-thirds of americans already think the country is off on the wrong track .                                
0 0 economic anxiety drives most of that .                                              
0 0 trump believes when you add in recent police shootings at home and terror abroad , there are enough voters will share his crisis mood and want something different .  
1 0 this is the legacy of hillary clinton : death , destruction , terrorism and weakness .                            
0 0 but hillary clinton 's legacy does not have to be america 's legacy .                                
1 0 we talked a bit about this before , but the challenge here -- i mean , trump is the challenger , he views hillary as the incumbent .    
0 0 and some strategists tell you if you have a challenger/incumbent environment , a , stir up controversy , but , b , try to create a crisis atmosphere .  
0 0 trump may not have to create it , it may be out there .                                
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 he is exaggerating it , though .                                              
1 0 he is exaggerating it .                                                  
0 0 but if you talk to voters , there is a lot of anxiety , definitely .                            
0 0 that is not a misread of the electorate on his part .                                    
0 0 but i also find that voters do not generally feel in their lives like things are coming apart at the seams and he does risk , i think , overplaying
0 0 i think he would be more successful if he did try to focus more on hillary clinton , what she did in the obama administration and how that is affecting
1 0 if he might be overplaying it , here is a question , the president of the united states is a key asset for hillary clinton , is he underplaying it
1 1 this vision of violence and chaos everywhere does n't really jive with the experience of most people .                        
0 0 i mean , i hope people the next morning walked outside and the birds were chirping and the sun was out .                
1 0 it was fascinating to me in trump 's speech is that he started by making a case against obama .                    
0 0 before he got to clinton , he was making the case against the incumbent president , which is key to this change environment , you need something different .  
0 0 when the president talks about the birds chirping and everything , again , could that almost seem too soft ?                    
1 0 i mean , i think it can .                                            
0 0 i really think that there is deep , deep anxiety out there .                                  
0 0 you know , in terms of economic anxiety , voters will say to you , `` well , i 'm doing okay , but i know a lot of people
0 0 on the national security anxiety , there is real fear that these attacks are happening in random places , that it 's here in our country and , you know
0 0 and i think a lot of voters are open to hearing from both sides , you know , what they would do to actually handle what they do see as
1 0 with the caveat that a national security event this fall would have a dramatic effect on the american psyche , i actually do n't think it 's that bad right
0 0 president obama 's numbers are above 50 percent for the first time in a long time .                          
0 0 the unemployment rate is now below 5 percent .                                          
0 0 he got reelected when the unemployment rate was far higher than that .                                  
0 0 and again , they are running against somebody who is simply unacceptable to wide swaths of the electorate .                      
0 0 this is not a national election .                                              
0 0 if donald trump ca n't carry florida , virginia , colorado , nevada he is going to have to pull a perfect straight across the rust belt to win and
1 0 unlikely perhaps , but one of the things he hopes sell there , and we heard at the convention , in the old days -- we talked about at the
0 0 if you 're a republican , you went right to the primaries , you move to the middle , democrat , you went left in the primaries , you move
0 0 donald trump maybe on a couple things moved to the middle , but on the issue of immigration , we talk about how much he needs latino votes , donald
1 0 we are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration , to stop the gangs , and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into
1 0 this is a huge gamble .                                                
1 0 you can not get more of a clear choice .                                        
0 0 you saw tim kaine yesterday , `` we are for a path to citizenship , not legal status . ''                    
0 0 donald trump says , `` we 're going to build a wall . ''                                
1 0 the fact that he has n't moderated his message really at all and even on the muslim ban as we heard , he has talked about how his most recent
0 0 i mean , i think that is a huge problem for the campaign going forward , but trump seems to want to stay right on that message and stick with
1 0 and what jonathan said , it has to be a straight win all across the rust belt including here in pennsylvania .                
0 0 and that -- you know , there is no doubt states like pennsylvania , ohio , maybe even michigan , much more competitive than four years ago , but it
1 1 we did in the primaries , the question is , will we in the general --                            
1 0 yes , but it 's a bigger audience .                                          
0 0 the reality is , we 're going to hear a couple people on this stage , one is michelle obama , we had her in the clip earlier .  
0 0 boy , is she a big asset in terms of getting younger voters out and african-american voters out .                      
0 1 she is , i 'm told , so invested in this election .                                  
0 0 it 's personal for her , too , and all against donald trump .                                
1 0 remember the birther issue .                                                  
0 0 this is very personal for the obama .                                            
0 0 it 's not just keep a democrat in the white house .                                    
0 0 it 's keep that guy out of the white house .                                      
1 0 there is not a good track record of obama turning out his voters for candidates besides himself .                        
0 0 keep in mind , 2010 , 2014 , he and michelle obama spent a lot of time trying to get the obama coalition out for other candidates .    
1 0 but i would say , this is a different scenario with donald trump on the edge of moving into that house .                
1 0 it 's hard to transfer popularity for him .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 we 're mentioning this industry rust belt , including this state here in pennsylvania .                              
0 0 one place trump is different than other republicans , is he says , i 'm against globalism , the full globalism , he calls it , and he 's promising
1 1 these are the forgotten men and women of our country and they are forgotten , but they are not going to be forgotten long .          
0 0 people who work hard but no longer have a voice , i am your voice .                            
1 0 i think i was not terribly articulate about it when we were talking about hillary clinton earlier , but that 's the challenge there is trump says i am your
0 0 she has to convince people , i 'm on your side .                                    
0 0 she has to convince people here , `` no , do n't buy into that , '' and tell them why it should be here .        
1 0 just think about how implausible that statement is by donald trump .                                    
0 0 i mean , this is a billionaire who is not -- has not been , you know , down in the mall with voters who are struggling .    
0 0 but he seems to be doing a better job right now of really tapping into that economic anxiety and i do n't know that she has quite found the message
1 0 you mentioned tim kaine , son of a welder , works with his hands .                              
0 0 maybe he can help we are with the blue collar language , if you will .                            
0 0 you get it .                                                    
0 0 the calluses and the burns , my dad worked with his hands .                                  
0 0 if you grow up with it , you see it .                                      
0 0 up next , yes , donald trump stuck to the script in his big convention speech , but the morning after -- a priceless reminder .        
0 0 he is a candidate like no other .                                            
0 0 one thing we do know about donald trump , he likes to tweet in the morning .                          
0 0 he is already out there tweeting this morning , he has moved on from saying bernie sanders has been disrespected , to giving an electoral college analysis .    
0 0 maybe he wants to work the magic wall .                                          
0 0 the other thing we know about donald trump is he does n't like to say sorry .                          
0 0 not even about retweeting an unflattering photo of heidi cruz .                                      
1 0 there were two things that he said yesterday were lies .                                      
0 1 ready ?                                                        
0 0 i did n't start anything with the wife .                                          
1 0 also , not going to apologize about spreading a tabloid story that ted cruz 's father was maybe involved -- yes , he said this -- in assassinating president kennedy
1 0 all i did is point out the fact that on the cover of the `` national enquirer '' , there was a picture of him and crazy lee harvey oswald
1 0 mike pence looks like he wants to be beamed to mars during all of that right there .                        
0 0 party unity , peace with ted cruz , no thanks .                                      
1 0 i do n't want his endorsement .                                              
0 0 just -- ted , stay home , relax , enjoy yourself .                                    
1 0 it 's just awesome political theater and it 's funny , but the morning after your convention , when you think he 's going to come out and rephrase the
1 0 they just ca n't keep him on track .                                          
0 0 all of his allies just sit there and they think , okay , he actually stuck -- the speech went too long , but he actually stuck to script for
1 1 it 's stunning that he did that .                                            
0 0 he can not let go when he feels like he has been wronged by someone .                            
0 0 that is my takeaway from this .                                              
0 0 this ted cruz situation eats at him .                                            
1 0 and that 's part of his creed in all of his books is about revenge and like never , you know , letting people screw you .      
1 0 but that was a green light , this whole fight and ted cruz 's speech where he said vote your conscious .                
0 0 so cruz has a role in this has a green light -- we have to go state by state to the never trump conservatives , there is a lot of
0 0 that was one green light .                                                
0 0 another thing conservatives are buzzing about is that they listened to ivanka trump and all the trump children were very impressive , but if you listen to ivanka trump ,
1 0 as president , my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce .  
0 0 and he will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all .                              
1 0 let 's be clear .                                                  
0 0 it was a great speech .                                                
0 0 she did a great job of reaching out to independent voters in a way her father has not been able to do but we have seen no policy on the
1 0 affordable child care , equal pay for women .                                          
0 0 employers should n't screw their workers .                                              
1 0 i ran into an adviser in the hallway after her so speech and i said where is this coming from , what 's the actual policy and they were like
0 0 so , we 'll have to see what he actually --                                      
1 1 i 'm waiting for her section of her speech about the border wall .                                
1 1 but that 's edited for time .                                              
1 0 that 's why democrats here though , are trying -- yes , it 's -- you can sort of laugh at this trump thing , but they actually want him
0 0 there is a worry out there among democrats that he ca n't possibly win .                              
0 0 he could win .                                                    
0 0 i think that 's one message we 're going to hear from the podium here , the dais there , that you should pay attention , you should take him
1 0 they should be much more aggressive going after him , jeff .                                    
0 0 i am astounded --                                                    
1 1 another role for tim kaine .                                                
1 1 -- that given what he has said about so many issues , foreign policy and domestic that they are not every day going after him , hammer and tong ,
0 0 where are the sort of fleet of retired generals and admirals who are saying these times are too serious , this man is a risk to america and the world
0 0 what are they waiting for ?                                                
0 0 i just do n't get it .                                              
1 0 i think you will see some of it here and i think you will see it in advertising .                      
0 0 another thing , i call this the `` star trek '' moment of the republican convention .                          
0 0 donald trump took republicans to where they have never been before , he boldly went where no republican convention has gone before .              
0 0 he talked about protecting the lgbtq community from terrorism .                                        
0 0 he did n't talk much about discrimination here at home .                                      
0 0 he said terrorism .                                                    
0 0 and then you had silicon valley executive peter thiel standing before the republican convention saying this .                          
1 1 i am proud to be gay .                                              
0 0 i am proud to be a republican .                                            
0 0 but most of all i am proud to be an american .                                    
0 0 i do n't pretend to agree with every plank in our party 's platform , but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline , and nobody in
1 1 he 's talking about the other culture wars .                                          
0 0 i mean , that 's the thing , trump has no interest in sexual politics -- abortion , gay rights , not his thing .          
0 0 but he 's very interested in culture wars , it 's just race-oriented culture wars .                            
0 0 it 's immigration , it 's islamic terrorism , it 's a different strain of the culture wars .                      
1 0 he is still very much stoking those --                                            
1 1 that 's how he won the primary .                                            
1 1 of course .                                                      
1 0 it is .                                                      
0 0 and he has managed to stay away from those culture wars until he gets mike pence on the ticket .                    
0 0 and this is where i think that that pick could be risky for you , because you do have these moments at the convention , in trump 's speech and
0 0 but mike pence is going to put trump on the spot on some of these issues .                          
1 0 on the floor the reaction you heard cheers , but on the floor , the reaction was very mixed .                    
0 0 you know , new jersey was jumping up and giving him -- peter thiel a standing ovation , then in lots of the more conservative states people were sitting down
0 0 it 's not like the republican party is suddenly unified on this issue .                                
1 0 and yet , yet , no matter what happens to donald trump in this election , having him speak to the issues from the podium , a lot of progressives
0 0 you talk about , and having a gay american speak at that convention , it 's a wall coming down at the republican convention .          
0 0 we 'll see where it goes from here .                                          
0 0 up next , our reporters empty their notebooks including trump 's double- edged sword when it comes to colorado .                    
0 0 but , first , here are the results from our inside politics quiz .                                
0 0 we ask , which trump child would you most like to see run for office .                            
0 0 most of you said -- i guess this is no surprise -- ivanka .                                
0 0 we 'll close , as we always do , asking our great reporters to share a little something from their notebooks .                
0 0 jonathan martin ?                                                      
1 1 john , there 's going to be one democrat here who has gone to every convention since 1960 with one exception , willie brown , the former mayor of san
0 0 but it was fascinating talking to him about the changing nature of these conventions .                              
0 0 you know , he was a young man in his 30s fighting folks from the south who did not want to have black delegations seated .        
0 0 he is now here at the end of a two-term black president .                                  
0 0 and watching him you talk about the changes over the years and what the party has become was a fascinating , fascinating hour for me .        
1 0 ca n't wait to take a look at that one .                                      
0 0 julie pace ?                                                      
1 1 democrats , obviously , have a lot of stars taking the stage this week .                              
0 0 the obamas , the clintons , joe biden , elizabeth warren , but that lineup is emblematic of a problem leaders are concerned about .          
0 0 there is n't a big bench for the democratic party , particularly in governor 's mansions across the country , you 've seen a lot of losses under the obama
0 0 but conventions are often where stars are made , you can just ask obama that .                            
0 0 and so , you have democratic leaders who will be watching some of these lesser known democrats to see if one of them may be the next rising star who
1 0 we 'll watch that .                                                  
0 0 who emerges from here as a star .                                            
0 0 maeve ?                                                        
1 1 well , so , obviously , the focus is on democrats this week , but later this week , we are expecting trump to head out west to colorado ,
0 0 talking to people in that state , though , it 's really interesting to see the reaction to the pence pick there because in some ways pence could help trump
0 0 so , it will be fascinating to see how he plays that this week and whether we see any message tweaks at all which we with did not see in
1 0 also , a lot of those cruz people in that colorado delegation in cleveland .                              
0 0 we 'll see how they feel next week .                                          
1 0 the bernie sanders brush fire is almost to be extinguished but it may have one more round here in philadelphia on this floor behind us .        
0 0 some sanders delegates are hoping that monday is an opportunity for them to have their say .                          
0 0 they were watching what happened in cleveland with great interest .                                      
0 0 yes , the rules are different , almost everything is different , the clintons definitely are running a tighter convention here , but the sanders people are not that thrilled
0 0 so , that has inflamed what really had cooled off and the peace process was well under way .                      
0 0 but the sanders brush fire has at least 48 more hours to burn , and then i think it 's finally extinguished .              
1 0 wow .                                                        
0 0 we 'll keep an eye .                                                
0 0 we 're right down on the floor .                                            
0 0 we 'll see how it goes here .                                            
0 0 i 'll close with this , why make a decision when you can appoint a commission ?                          
0 0 one of bernie sanders key demands at the convention is that the party get rid of so-called super delegates , those are those elected officials who get votes here at
0 0 well , i 'm guessing you are not shocked to hear there is some push back from those super delegates and their party establishment friends .        
0 0 so , the convention rules committee last night proposed a commission , with a report due in 2018 .                      
0 0 now , superdelegates would not be eliminated under the suggested framework of the commission 's work , but most of those super delegates would be required if the recommendation is
0 0 only a small group of very senior party leaders like the president , congressional leaders would remain free to support whoever they wanted .            
0 0 now , team sanders is n't thrilled but it did n't have the votes to resolve the issue in philadelphia .                  
0 0 that 's it for us on inside politics today .                                        
0 0 thanks for sharing your sunday morning .                                              
0 0 hope to see you at noon eastern every day during the week ahead for a special convention edition of inside politics .                
0 0 up next , `` state of the union '' with philadelphia 's own jake tapper .

    welcome back .                                                      
    this is not normal .                                                  
    the morning after a big debate .                                              
0 0 and just 29 days to election day .                                            
1 0 well , you know , i 'll always keep my conversation with donald trump and my family private , but it 's absolutely false to suggest that at any point
0 0 it 's the greatest honor of my life to be nominated by my party to be the next vice president of the united states of america .      
1 0 that was strange .                                                    
0 0 this is also not normal .                                                
0 0 donald trump last night making clear the man you just saw there , governor pence , does n't speak for him on syria policy .          
1 0 he and i have n't spoken .                                              
0 0 and i disagree .                                                    
1 0 your two minutes is up .                                                
1 0 i do n't like assad at all , but assad is killing isis .                                
0 0 russia is killing isis and iran is killing isis .                                        
0 0 and those three have now lined up , because of our weak foreign policy .                              
1 0 the fact checkers and international correspondents who 've covered that conflict , let 's say trump is kind of wrong about assad and russia .          
0 0 and for all of these efforts to gloss this one over , it 's clear , mike pence sees things very , very differently .          
1 0 the provocations by russia need to be met with american strength .                                    
0 0 and if russia chooses to be involved and continue i should say that be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in aleppo , the united states of america should
1 0 it 's quite common when you pick a running mate that the nominee and the running mate have some disagreements but they are worked out around the convention .  
0 0 the running mate normally says he 's boss now .                                        
0 0 i agree with his position , i 'll give him my counsel in private .                              
0 0 that 's pretty extraordinary , i mean -- that mike -- and donald trump through mike pence under the bus .                  
1 0 under the bus .                                                    
0 0 i disagree with him .                                                  
0 0 he has n't talk to me about this .                                          
0 0 i do n't talk to him about it , yeah .                                      
0 0 this is like one of the most striking examples of a disagreement between two members of the same ticket that i 've ever seen in presidential politics .    
0 0 and just on trump 's position here , he 's not just wrong .                                
0 0 i mean he is parroting the propaganda of the assad regime and russian government which is to say all of the opposition to assad is isis , they 're all
0 0 so he 's got his other , not looked at decision carefully , he 's been in very bad advice from a so foreign policy advisers .      
0 0 and obviously pence does not believe that .                                            
0 0 pence 's view is that the assad regime is , you know , is awful and putin is a strongman intervening and needs to be pushed back by the americans
1 1 pence has the pretty much mainstream republican view , maybe a little bit hawkish view , some , ryan paul might disagree with him , but paul ryan agrees with
1 0 mike pence 's view of this situation is closer to hillary clinton 's than it is to donald trump .                    
0 0 and as matter of fact , this what they -- what donald trump said last night , it was that he has not talked to his running mate about what
0 0 i think that 's pretty remarkable .                                              
1 0 another issue i want to bring up , because this is n't one of the reasons paul ryan is breaking from the nominee .            
0 0 they understand after this tape came out .                                            
0 0 they think there 's more to come .                                            
0 0 they think more women are going to come forward .                                        
0 0 they 're worried there are snippets from the apprentice and other trump on t.v .                              
0 0 that are about to come out .                                              
1 1 00 a.m. against miss universe , he was asked about it last night , here 's what donald trump said .                  
1 0 it was n't check out a sex tape .                                          
0 0 it was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout .          
0 0 tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication .                                      
0 0 i mean , you can like it or not like it .                                    
0 0 i have between facebook and twitter .                                              
0 0 i have almost 25 million people .                                              
0 0 it 's a very effective way of communication .                                          
0 0 so you can put it down , but it is a very effective form of communication .                          
0 0 i 'm not unproud of it , to be honest with you .                                  
1 0 so the republican nominee for president , the man who wants to sit in the oval office and tell you how the country 's going said , `` this was
0 0 twitter has this wonderful thing .                                                
0 0 computer service saved things .                                                  
0 0 here 's donald trumps ' tweet of 5:00 something in the morning .                                  
0 0 did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past ?                                    
0 0 that would be check out sex tape and past .                                        
0 0 this is one of the reasons republicans are nervous , and as we start the conversation , we talked about the nbc wall street journal poll that shows hillary clinton
0 0 look at this .                                                    
0 0 they have a generic ballot question .                                              
0 0 what would you prefer ?                                                  
0 0 a democratic controlled congress or republican controlled congress ?                                          
0 0 49 percent say democratic controlled congress , 42 percent say republican controlled congress .                                
0 0 that is a shift .                                                  
0 1 that is a shift from -- if you went back a month or two ago and looked at the polling .                  
0 0 that and this whole conversation about temperament , character , treatment of women is why so many republicans are running away .                
1 1 yeah , look , i think the dynamic here in many of them frustrated , i think , many republicans , supporters of others were frustrated during the primary season
0 0 like what bar does he need to hit us or basic acceptability ?                                  
0 0 and i 've noodled on that myself .                                            
0 0 and it is -- people are jonesing for a change election .                                    
0 0 they 're being offered status quo that they really do n't like in the form of hillary clinton and change that they 're afraid of .        
0 0 so they want him to give them a reason to go there .                                  
0 0 and he keeps refusing to do so .                                            
1 0 is that the time i run my country and talk to trump supporters .                                
0 0 i have discovered a phenomenon that i have never seen with any other candidate where if you ask somebody why they 're supporting him they say , he says what
0 0 and then if you ask them well , what about this outrageous thing he just said this morning , they will state , well , he did n't mean that
0 0 so people -- his supporters can somehow simultaneously have the two ideas in their heads that he is both a refreshing truth-teller and that he does n't mean what he
1 1 i call that the kardashian effect .                                              
0 0 there are people who watch reality television , they know it 's exaggerated on purpose and they somehow process trump that way .              
0 0 oh , we know , mexico 's are n't going to pay for the wall but he 's going to be tough on immigration .          
0 0 we know you ca n't ban all muslims because basically , we 're tougher than the other guys .                      
0 0 and you 're right .                                                  
0 1 no other candidate could ever possibly get away with it .                                      
1 0 and they say i heard what he said but i know what he means .                              
1 1 yeah , they judge him by a different standard into conventional ...                                    
1 1 for that intent .                                                    
0 0 the file .                                                      
1 0 so you 're point on the generic ballot though .                                        
0 0 i mean historically speaking , because of the way voters are distributed across the country , democrats need a five or six-point edge in the generic ballot before they can
0 0 here we are in the nbc wall street journal poll at a seven-point edge for democrats .                          
0 0 if that gets up to eight , nine , 10 points , the senates gone and the house is , start to get real touchy .        
1 0 and that 's why all the republicans are little touchy .                                      
0 0 that 's how it works , connect the dots .                                        
0 0 up next , donald trump says , you bet he did n't pay federal taxes .                            
0 0 and if that makes you mad , he says , blame hillary clinton .                                
0 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 remember that nearly $ 1 billion loss donald trump took on his 1991 tax return ?                            
1 0 the `` new york times '' published three pages of your 1995 tax return that show you claimed the $ 916 million loss .            
0 0 you have not answered , though , a simple question .                                      
0 0 did you use that $ 916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes ?                            
1 0 of course , i do .                                                
0 0 and so do all of her donors .                                            
1 0 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes ?                              
1 0 no , but i pay tax and i pay federal tax too .                                  
0 0 but i have a write-off , a lot of its depreciation which is a wonderful charge .                          
0 0 i love depreciation and , you know , she 's given it to us .                              
1 0 it 's part of that answer .                                              
0 1 donald trump , acknowledging he did used this write-off to avoid paying federal taxes .                              
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 nothing illegal about that .                                                  
0 0 perfectly legal , for everything we know anyway .                                          
0 0 perfectly legal , but democrats ...                                                
1 1 but confirming one of the mysteries about this .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 yes , democrats who you said against .                                            
0 0 and he also said hillary clinton supporters who he specifically named who are involved that who that just released this statement which it 's titled some facts for donald trump
0 0 and where about it says , i 've paid federal income tax every year since 1944 , when i was 13 .                
0 0 and though a slow starter , i only paid $ 7 in tax that year .                            
0 0 but he said if federal income tax for the year 2015 was $ 1,845,557 .                              
0 0 so , we 're about to trying hillary clinton fire back here saying , show us more donald .                      
0 0 is that damaging ?                                                    
0 0 i mean everybody assumed will you take that big of a write-off , you take it for a reason .                    
0 0 and again there 's nothing that we know illegal about what donald trump did , but just admitting there , yeah , sure .            
1 0 i think it 's -- i mean that in whole story which seems like a life time ago , right ?                  
1 0 it sure does .                                                    
1 0 it happens since then , was always damaging and that it brought back the stories about what a failure he was in the late '80s or early '90s after he
0 0 and his casino has failed .                                                
0 0 then he bought the yacht .                                                
0 0 and just that entire period of his life where he was one the edge of personal bankruptcy and , you know , escaped it by the skin of his teeth
0 0 and that 's what that , you know , that 's what that 1995 tax document .                          
0 0 it was sort of part of that , part of his legacy .                                  
0 0 and now it was thought it was damaging .                                          
0 0 this was a reminder that this guy has not always been the great businessman he said he was .                      
1 0 and let 's go to the other portion today .                                        
0 0 we talked a lot about donald trump , because he raises a lot to talk about in these debates .                    
0 0 but hillary clinton , a couple times donald trump did get her back on her heels and the moderators did as well about what she hacked e- mails .  
0 0 john podesta , the campaign chairman 's e-mails have bee hacked and had some excerpts -- the campaign has not denied their offenses .            
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 he had confirmed it , of some of the things she said in this close doors speeches , mostly the wealthy bankers .              
0 0 and she was asked again last night , both from the moderators and donald trump a pressed about her private e-mail server .              
1 0 look , it 's just not true and so please ...                                      
1 1 oh , you did n't delete them ?                                            
1 1 allow her to respond please .                                                
1 0 the personal e-mails not official ...                                                
1 1 oh , a 33,000 ?                                                  
0 1 yeah , right .                                                    
1 0 not -- well , we turned over 35,000 .                                          
0 0 so ...                                                        
1 1 oh yeah .                                                      
0 1 what about the other 15,000 ?                                                
1 0 please allow her to respond .                                                
0 0 she did n't talk while you talked .                                            
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 that 's true .                                                    
0 0 i did n't .                                                    
1 0 because you have nothing to say .                                              
1 0 and i did n't in the first debate .                                          
0 0 and i 'm going to try not to in this debate , because i 'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk
1 0 and the get off this question .                                              
1 0 you know , if you do n't like trump , you do n't like that .                            
0 0 but in the first debate she gave a tight answer , i 'm sorry , and tried to just put it away .              
0 1 in this debate , at least , he got combative with her and made her talk about it more .                    
0 0 and when she does that , sometimes she gets into lawyerly land .                                  
1 1 yeah .                                                        
0 0 and not just that a lawyerly about what that answer where she says all of what you said untrue about that .                
0 1 you know , it 's just a wheelbarrow full of lies .                                    
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 it 's like much of that is not true .                                        
0 0 and she 's trying to over and over again to say these things that are n't true .                        
0 0 does it matter in line of the fact that his foibles will cover that up ?                            
0 0 i 'm not sure , but he did a better job of prosecuting the case on obamacare and this last night .                
1 1 well , from what minor saying with the -- whether she did deleted them or not is that they got this subpoena right ?            
0 0 from the house and the company that had already been told to delete them since office , and said oh , i was supposed to delete this and then the
0 0 not that hillary clinton called and said , hey , we got to get rid of those e-mails .                      
0 0 so , that 's just a fact check of what he said .                                  
0 0 there is a difference .                                                  
1 0 but it 's -- that 's -- if the timing of that still does n't pass the sniff test .                    
1 1 yeah .                                                        
0 0 not good .                                                      
0 1 wilson : yeah , that the notes are well .                                        
0 0 what are you doing with 33,000 e-mails ?                                            
0 0 but i turned over 35,000 e-mails .                                              
0 0 i mean i think we have with voter to think ...                                      
1 0 boy , that 's a lot of e-mails .                                          
0 0 and she did not help ...                                                
1 1 but , you know , she personally deleted it .                                        
0 1 and that 's right .                                                  
0 0 it was n't illegal .                                                  
0 0 he 's saying she should go to jail for something that the fbi has looked at in a fairly thorough way and then transparently ...          
1 1 and by the way that the house of representatives has looked at .                                  
0 0 and when donald trump is bringing up this notion that people have not prosecuted the case against hillary clinton , that the house of representatives is somehow against him .
0 0 he 's forgetting who 's in charge of congress .                                        
1 0 but also large numbers of voters have looked at this and decided , yes , she 's probably getting away with something here .            
1 0 sure .                                                        
1 0 and that 's the part of that was left on those reports .                                  
1 0 and on the hacked e-mails that revealed some what was she said in these private meetings like , you go to wall street people , because they know the most
0 1 well some might say that 's fox part in the hen house .                                  
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 1 and some other things .                                                  
0 0 she said well , the bigger issue is that russia has hacked .                                  
0 0 no , that 's an issue .                                              
0 0 that 's an issue that russia is hacking , and the russia might trying to close the election .                      
0 0 but there 's also an issue about what she said that she does n't want to answer .                        
1 0 and i thought one of the most interesting exchanges of the night was the one over having one policy in public and another in private .        
0 0 and she tried to sort of draw it back to the movie `` lincoln '' and it offered trump one of his best opportunities .          
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
1 0 where he accused her besmirching on his babe .                                          
1 0 all right , so it was a good comeback .                                        
0 0 trump was much better at the comeback again if you do n't support him .                              
0 0 you do n't like it .                                                
0 0 but he was much better to give and take of debating .                                    
0 0 there was n't a first debate without a doubt .                                        
0 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 our report shift notebooks next .                                                
0 0 including the anxiety of republicans waiting for the next act in that t.v .                                
0 0 reality campaign we call donald trump .                                              
0 0 pictures here , hillary clinton boarding her campaign plane in new york , suburb in new york .                        
0 0 she 's off to detroit , motor city campaigning today .                                      
0 0 donald trump is on the road as well , two stops in pennsylvania .                                
0 0 you see hillary clinton there answering a question .                                          
0 0 she was asked , do you think trump will show up for third debate ?                              
0 0 she answered with one word , yes .                                            
0 0 i 'm sure hope so and will be there .                                        
0 1 before we go , let 's have run `` inside politics '' table .                                
0 0 ask our reporters to get you out ahead the big political news just around the corner , karen tumulty ?                    
1 1 well , i just think it 's worth pausing a moment here and reflecting on the fact that one of the things that got lost last night was whole function
0 0 i think that 's what has got lost in this election .                                    
0 0 and the final month is not going to do anything to correct that .                                
1 0 i think you 're right .                                                
0 0 i blame the candidates , not moderators who trying to get to more questions , but the candidates just keep going at each other but used to keep quite .
0 0 we should listen to voters , ryan ?                                            
1 0 you know , in mid-august , one of trump 's senior advisers had a meeting with him and he said , look , the biggest issue in the polling is
0 0 and the last opportunity to get the american people or at least that group of voters that you need to win this thing .            
0 0 the last opportunity to fix that problem without temperament , are these debates , right ?                            
0 0 and it 's only to miss debate in a trump campaign , is he going to win with some massive , new upsurge in white working class voters ?  
0 1 add into the poll says that 's not going to happen or he going to real back in those white college educated suburb and , especially women in places that
0 0 and his temperament issue was about the latter .                                          
0 0 and that ying and yang of the trump campaign white working class , college educated living and fighting about that for months .              
0 0 i think what we 've seen in these last two debates is that they are doubling down on the base on a white working class surge and that is the
1 0 well , watch and try to turn it .                                          
0 1 well , he 's in pennsylvania today .                                            
0 0 reid ?                                                        
1 1 over the last several action cycles we 've seen the cost of politics rise exponentially .                            
0 0 it 's not just citizens united .                                              
0 0 it 's not anything like that .                                              
0 0 it 's just that more money is getting into the political system .                                  
0 0 this year , however , there 's something remarkably different about that and it reflects the fact that republican outside groups are virtually abandoning the presidential race and frankly ,
0 0 take a look in the amount of money spent on television in the battle for the united states senate .                    
0 0 that 's north of $ .5 billion .                                            
0 0 the amount money spent television in the presidentially race is about $ 350 million in 2012 and 2008 .                      
0 0 frankly , in every other modern political cycle , the amount money spent on the race for the white house has been far higher than amount spent on down about
1 0 you have found the panels and references , that 's the turned upside down , right ?                          
1 0 the last 30 days of these are going to be somewhat forge republican party about finding one of those runaway trucks off ramps .            
0 0 and like , this last weekend , when those upper dumps might have been the last one , a bunch of people abandoned him .          
0 0 this whole thing joining with him is always been about like camping with a grizzly bear .                          
0 0 and you might think you have an understanding with that grizzly bear , but he will eventually turn on you .                  
0 0 and the rest of the month is going to be real rocky for the people who are still onboard and there will be more apo .        
0 0 anyone who thought they were getting through october with a candidate who 's been on mic being donald trump for the last 45 years without anymore apo , they were
1 0 twenty nine days is a long time .                                            
0 0 i 'll end with this .                                                
0 0 is the cake baked ?                                                  
0 0 or is this deja vu all over again ?                                          
0 0 and by that i mean this , there 's remarkable consistency among republicans strategist not affiliated with the trump campaign .                  
0 0 they look at the polling , new numbers are showed you pretty glaring .                                
0 0 see hillary clinton is national and battleground state leads .                                        
0 0 they think the cake is baked .                                              
0 0 meaning , the race is over .                                              
0 0 no matter what trump does in the next 29 days ?                                      
0 1 i stood by that view after the debate last night saying trump no doubt shored up his right flank , but likely made little or no ahead , right ,
0 0 and these are smart people .                                                
0 0 and they are intimately involved in house and senate races in this key battleground states .                            
0 0 so , they know the terrain .                                              
0 0 but here 's my question , are they underestimating trump again ?                                    
0 0 they do n't think so .                                                
0 0 but , remember many of theses the same people told us there was no way .                            
0 0 the reality t.v .                                                    
0 0 showman who was once pro-choice and once pro-clinton could ever win the nomination .                                
0 0 so , cake baked or deja vu all over again ?                                      
0 0 twenty nine days in counting .

1 0 issues of war and peace , taxes and spending , maybe something unique to your state or your family .                    
0 0 but first most voters have a more fundamental test .                                        
0 0 is this candidate ready for primetime ?                                              
1 0 i 've heard of many tragic cases of walking , talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines .              
1 0 now senator rand paul 's staff had to clean that one up and then the senator himself tried for a second take .              
0 0 in a statement he said , quote , `` i did not say vaccines caused disorders , just that they were temporally related .            
0 0 i did not allege causation , '' the senator said , `` i support vaccines .                            
0 0 i received them myself and had all of my children vaccinated .                                    
0 0 then with that statement came this , a tweet -- of course , a picture of the senator getting a booster shot .              
0 0 that 's how we do politics these days .                                          
0 0 the new jersey governor chris christie needed some cleanup so .                                      
0 0 after he made clear -- crystal clear -- he said he had his children vaccinated but then he added this .                  
1 0 but i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well .                        
0 0 so that 's the battle the government has to decide .                                      
1 0 now , remember both of these men are getting ready to run for president and both were asked this question amid a serious measles outbreak in this country .  
0 0 mike allen , they stumbled on the vaccination question .                                        
0 0 i 'm not so concerned in that as much as they -- which they tried to quickly fix .                      
0 0 so what does it tell us about their preparation ?                                        
0 0 they 're getting to run -- ready to run for president ?                                    
0 1 you have to be ready for these questions .                                          
1 1 well no .                                                      
0 0 that 's exactly right .                                                  
0 0 and people have been saying for weeks and weeks and weeks , when the time is right , when the light is on , chris christie will be ready .
0 0 but he 's not .                                                  
0 0 on this foreign trip people did n't think it was possible to have a worst foreign trip than in the old days .              
0 0 but governor christie pulled it off .                                              
0 0 he did the exact things he did n't want to do .                                    
0 0 he wanted to look well informed , he wanted to look statesmanlike and he wanted to not look like a bully and he came out .        
0 0 and you see him responding to a question from phil rucker , your colleague , about isis which he should have welcomed a question on with the other stories that
0 0 and he said , what part of `` no questions '' do n't you understand ?                            
0 0 that 's the old chris christie .                                              
0 0 that 's not what he wants to be .                                          
1 0 and in rand paul 's case , he 's gotten this far in his political career by playing by his own rules .              
0 0 and i kind of sense that he feels like he 's a little too good for the process .                      
0 0 that he can shush a reporter on national television when she asked him about vaccines that i can do whatever i want ; that play the victim and blame the
0 1 look , at some point you have to enact some measure of discipline over what you 're saying .                      
0 0 rand paul has a bad habit of saying one thing in one place and something else in another --                      
1 1 and then saying he did n't say it .                                          
1 1 -- and then saying he did n't say it .                                        
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 that 's the problem .                                                  
0 1 at a basic level , we talk about mitt romney and the downfalls of running for president a couple of times and not doing so well .      
0 0 one of the great things about running for president more than one is you have experience in this .                      
0 0 and i think what we saw with these two candidates who are really testing the waters in a serious way for the first time is that they have a risk
0 0 and even in chris christie 's case and rand paul to some degree , the experience of seeing something that you 've been seeing in your home state for a
1 0 and understanding the moment .                                                  
0 0 understanding you 're speaking at a time when the country is dealing with this outbreak in more than a dozen states now .              
0 0 at a time when you 're getting ready to go from exploring to whether you 're stepping in .                      
0 0 i mean whether you like it or not , we live in the ages of you can get asked about boxers or briefs .            
0 0 you 're going to get asked questions of war and piece .                                    
0 0 you want the nuclear football ?                                                
0 0 anything in today --                                                    
1 1 you saw the other republicans .                                                
0 0 i mean most other republicans came out and said , `` listen , get your kids vaccinated .                        
0 0 this is n't a matter that you want to play around with . ''                                
0 0 so that was an interesting contrast , too .                                          
0 0 another contrast was in the way they just dealt with the media ,                                  
0 0 particularly if you looked at jeb bush 's handling of the media .                                  
0 0 this last week he took questions , he seemed almost joyous in taking those questions and then you had rand paul and chris christie really shot the media down .
1 0 you have to wonder if christie who is actually , you know , contrary to what we thought a year ago making a play for conservatives in iowa .  
0 0 he went out there and talked to them last week at the iowa freedom summit .                            
0 0 and you have to wonder to your point , instead of rising to the occasion he 's thinking about tactics and strategy -- these things are playing around in his
1 0 pandering to people .                                                    
1 0 the -- anti-government crowd -- right .                                              
0 0 like i need to throw a dog whistle in their direction .                                    
1 0 and if chris christie does that , he loses everything that people like about chris christie .                          
1 1 right .                                                        
0 0 that he 's tough .                                                  
1 1 the amount of e-mails i 'm sure all of us got from donors , from voters , from our parents and our friends about chris christie in this case is
0 0 because look , rand paul , he 's always had the anti-government crowd a little bit in his corner .                    
0 0 there are mainstream people , crossover voters , donors , center right who saw this and were turned off by it in a big way .        
1 0 the lunchtime conversation all around d.c. today was who had a worse week , rand or christie ?                        
0 0 you do n't want to be in that conversation .                                        
0 0 what one republican said to me was senator paul 's problem this week was he sounded like his dad and that 's not what he wanted .      
0 0 henderson sort of flirting with conspiracy theories , right , which has been something that his father --                        
0 1 you will hear a lot of republicans -- and i know you guys are getting the e-mails too -- a lot of republicans will predict this is the first of
0 0 now , people are focusing on him for the first time moving this around .                              
0 0 we 're going to see a lot more .                                          
1 0 and they have to understand even though it 's a year until the first voting .                            
0 0 they 're getting more busy .                                                
0 0 they 're getting more active .                                                
0 0 more of them are getting in .                                              
0 0 so we 're going to get more aggressive and treat them like presidential candidates , which is a different level of political campaign .            
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 and he 's had that image , right , of the most interesting man in politics .                          
0 0 he was on the cover of `` time magazine '' .                                      
0 0 and really i mean liberals in some ways talk about rand paul as someone who could make -- possibly change the way the republican party looked but more strength needs
1 0 peter , do you agree with this , for rand paul he has to make it happen faster than for anyone else ?              
0 0 if it 's going to happen for him it 's going to happen -- have to happen soon .                      
0 0 like he has deadlines at home and i feel like the clock is ticking faster for him than for --                    
1 1 whether he 'll run for reelection in 2016 and the issues there , right .                              
1 1 yes , he has to make that decision soon .                                        
0 0 and look he definitely has to learn to pivot from the base to start talking to the bigger , you know , obviously all these people in a republican primary
0 0 they have to be wary of talking to the general american public .                                  
1 0 and when he went and talked to the koch brothers , right , the comparison -- there were contrasts there between marco rubio suit and tie and him wearing .
1 0 one thing we hear from the republicans over and over again is we need a morning in america kind of message , a hopeful future looking message .    
0 0 rand paul , i mean he does look very low key at times .                                
0 0 he looks dour , he looks combative .                                            
1 0 he looks like a complainer , victim .                                            
1 0 i know these are sort of like process questions .                                        
1 0 but if christie and paul had a bad week -- we 'll let the town decide which one had the worst of the bad weeks -- jeb bush had a
0 0 the question is what does he make of it ?                                        
0 0 he gave a speech to the detroit economic club .                                        
0 0 he said i 'll give you the details retails .                                        
0 0 but he said `` i 'm a republican who cares about cities .                                  
0 0 i 'm a republican who cares about poverty .                                          
0 0 i 'm a republican who wants to help everybody .                                        
0 0 he lay out his economic message but the question for jeb bush is , yes , he 'd be a strong general election candidate .          
0 0 can he win the republican nomination when he 's counter to the base on education ?                            
0 0 counter to the base on immigration which listen to this part of the speech where he says this one should be easy .              
1 0 this should be the lowest hanging fruit to be honest with you because this is a huge opportunity .                      
0 0 immigration is not a problem .                                                
0 0 the immigrant experience in our country makes us unique and special and different and it is part of our extraordinary success over time .            
1 0 has he been watching his party the last six weeks ?                                      
0 0 i mean he 's talking about legal immigration .                                          
0 0 i get what he 's saying and he 's right in terms of the history of this country and the richness of our diversity .          
0 0 however , has he been to iowa or south carolina in the last six years and tried to tell an activist republican voter immigration is great ?      
1 0 well , that is going to be the problem .                                        
0 0 and just before we went on the air we were talking about the fact that he 's seen a lot of economics clubs , a lot of us -- not
0 0 but what governor bush did there was very deliberate and probably smart .                                  
0 0 he did something gutsy which we do n't normally from politicians .                                    
0 0 and that was he said `` this is where i am on immigration .                                
0 0 you may not like it , but this is where i 'm going . ''                              
0 0 he said , `` i 'm going to lead the party not just follow the rhetoric . ''                        
0 0 and that 's very rare .                                                
0 0 and that 's what his candidacy hinges on .                                          
1 1 and he 's got no choice -- right .                                          
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 that 's a good point .                                                
1 0 i mean given what he said before i mean he ca n't back down now .                            
1 0 he said that i 'm going to run for president on the issues that i care about and i 'm going to tell you where i stand .    
0 0 and so far he is living up to that promise .                                      
0 0 i do think that the interesting question will be when he 's away from the podium .                          
0 0 when he 's not reading off a teleprompter , when he 's walking , you know , through a diner in iowa and he 's getting confronted by voters ,
0 0 how does he explain that to an angry voter ?                                        
1 0 and i was talking to one of the smartest republicans about that as much as jeb bush is being talked about as the front- runner , the rules in politics
0 0 you have to win a state -- one of the early states .                                  
0 0 iowa , do n't know ; south carolina , do n't know ; florida , yes but then he 's probably not competitive in nevada .        
0 0 it 's almost like he almost has to win new hampshire and it 's all in there for him .                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 but you know there are a lot of blue-state republicans , right ?                                  
0 0 and there are more votes in red-state republicans which is the way that mitt romney ran and more .                      
1 0 or somehow convince more iowans to participate , convince different people to participate .                                
0 0 that 's the question .                                                  
0 0 we 'll see if he can lead the party .                                        
1 0 and to that point i mean jeb bush 's soon to be campaign manager david kochel was a romney guy , and ran the campaign in iowa .    
0 0 and what he did in iowa was he focused on 30,000 voters , they modeled the universe , that 's us .                
0 0 ignore the noise we 're going to go for them .                                      
0 0 so if that 's bush 's strategy --                                            
1 0 get your piece , come out alive .                                            
0 0 the field will start to winnow .                                              
0 1 we 'll see what happens .                                                
1 0 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 king : that 's a year from now .                                          
1 0 i think that 's next month .                                              
1 0 that 's a year away but it was an interesting week .                                    
0 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 just ahead , a new polling milestone -- you wo n't want to miss this .                            
0 1 and a prayer breakfast history lesson infuriates the president 's critics .                                    
0 0 first though , politicians say the darnedest things , messing with texas , congressman alcee hastings style .                        
1 0 i do n't know about in your state , which i think is a crazy state to begin with , and i mean that just as i said it --
1 0 that 's a very defamatory statement about my state and i will not stand here and listen to it .                    
1 0 you can leave if you choose .                                              
0 0 i told you what i think about texas .                                          
0 0 i would n't live there for all the tea in china and that 's how i fee .                        
1 0 there is no reason at all to impugn the people , governor , of the state of this country and i will await the gentleman 's apology .    
1 0 you will wait until hell freezes over or for me to say anything in an apology .                          
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
1 0 among republicans , the democratic president , 13 percent ; among democrats , 83 percent .                            
0 0 so a 70-point gap between the two parties .                                          
0 0 how does that compare .                                                  
0 0 well , it was polarized under george w. bush but not quite as badly .                              
0 0 not the same number among his party but president bush had a little bit more average support among democrat -- a 61-point gap .            
0 0 and polarization you might say got more profound -- started to get more profound during the clinton administration .                      
0 0 again though , only 56 points there -- 61-70 .                                        
0 0 president obama clearly will be the most polarizing president in our history .                                  
0 0 he also did something fascinating this week that his critics found infuriating .                                  
0 0 at a key moment in the campaign against isis just as jordan ramps up its airstrikes , the president speaking to the national prayer breakfast delivered this bit of a
1 0 lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place , remember that during the crusades and the inquisition , people committed terrible deeds
0 0 in our home country , slavery and jim crow all too often was justified in the name of christ .                    
1 0 all true -- every bit of it true .                                          
0 0 the president 's critics say , why now ?                                          
0 0 why are you somehow trying to equate isis with things that happened in the past when not only is it a key moment in the military campaign but the president
1 0 it 's vintage obama .                                                  
0 0 this is what he does when he 's giving these speeches he gives people a history lesson .                        
0 0 he wants to walk you through how we got here even if he 's going back hundreds , thousands of years sometimes .              
0 0 so in some ways i was n't surprised to hear it .                                    
0 0 i also was n't surprised by the reaction to it given that there has been a lot of criticism some of it justified that obama , unlike other allies ,
0 0 he 's talking about violent extremism .                                              
0 0 and there 's a real frustration on capitol hill in particular that he 's not defining the enemy .                      
0 0 if you 're going to ask congress to vote on authorizing force to find the enemy for whom they 're going to be authorizing this force against .    
1 0 john , at this moment in his life , he 's not a history professor , he 's not a constitutional law professor , he 's not a pundit .
0 0 he 's the president of the united states .                                          
0 0 and this is forgetting that role .                                              
0 0 we want our president on the high horse .                                          
0 0 and eric schultz the principal deputy press secretary today explaining after the remarks are made and he said , `` well , it 's the president 's view that we
0 0 and that the way we get our moral standing around the country is doing that . ''                          
0 0 that 's not what a lot of people want our president doing .                                  
0 0 there are other people who can be the history professor or the pundit .                                
1 0 and i think he would argue thought that that is what the president should do .                            
0 0 a president of the united states should be able to explain to the public the history of how we got here especially when it 's a decision that he is
0 1 you want this explained to people -- the context of it .                                    
1 1 bobby jindal , the louisiana governor , among those who might run for president in the republican side had this statement .                
0 0 he said , `` mr. president , the medieval christian threat is under control .                              
0 0 please deal with the radical islamist threat today . ''                                        
0 0 i mean that 's the point .                                              
0 0 in the middle of this urgent crisis , why are you trying to give a history lecture .                        
0 0 if you 're a fan of president obama , you 'll say this is who is .                          
0 0 he 's thoughtful .                                                    
0 0 he does n't try to divide people .                                            
0 0 he 's trying to make a historic point .                                          
0 0 and if you 're a critic of the president , if you read the conservative blogs of the crazy people who 've come back out saying it 's proof he
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 other people have come back out saying , you know , questioning his christianity .                              
0 1 but you do have this dispute in the conservative blogosphere a lot of it is gobbledygook except he needs republican votes and they 're influenced by this people .  
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 and i think the average american might not want to be caught up in this history lesson or conversation about the semantics of it .          
0 0 they 're wondering , what 's going on with isis ?                                      
0 0 is isis on the run ?                                                
0 0 are we equipped to deal with isis ?                                            
0 0 is it going to be -- are we going to need boots on the ground ?                            
0 0 do we have a stomach for having boots on the ground to take on isis ?                            
0 0 so i think --                                                    
1 1 no , no , yes , no .                                            
1 1 well , yes .                                                    
0 0 so you know , i think that 's the backdrop and the more , you know , pressing back drop in these sort of other debates that have been going
1 0 this is going to be just another talking point to throw into red meat speeches in iowa .                        
0 0 the president is drawing the moral equivalency between christianity and radical islam .                                  
0 0 and like bobby jindal and many other people are going to be saying that for the next year .                      
1 0 and it is expected -- just going back to the polling numbers that you were showing -- i mean i just thing that one central part of this president 's
0 0 it 's pretty incredible .                                                  
1 0 the most polarizing president in history .                                              
0 0 maybe the next one will be more polarizing because it seems to be the trend .                            
1 0 we talked about this , this week .                                            
0 0 this is what academics call sorting .                                              
0 0 this is sort of natural party realignment that 's been happening over time .                                
0 0 if you go back and look in the same poll , i mean the gap for richard nixon was much smaller but the parties were different then .    
0 1 you know , you had reagan democrats voting for republicans .                                      
0 1 right .                                                        
0 1 and it 's the world we live in where you get news in facebook .                              
0 0 you have your ideological silos .                                                
0 0 so yes --                                                      
1 1 almost as if there 's no middle .                                            
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 it 's sort of proof that it is the environment .                                      
0 0 on the poll the last ten slots for most polarizing president , six of them go to obama --                      
1 1 and four go to bush .                                                
1 0 go to bush .                                                    
0 0 that 's so not a coincidence .

1 1 well , as we all know there are a few people in washington more disappointed that mitt romney was n't running than democrats .            
0 0 but democrats feel like they are still going to be able to revive their romney playbook because they want to equate jeb bush with romney .        
0 0 they both worked in finance .                                                
0 0 they both backed the wall street bailout .                                            
0 0 they both opposed the auto bailout .                                              
0 0 after jeb bush makes his speeches you sometimes get notes from democrats saying , oh , look how similar this is to things that mitt romney said .    
0 0 the obvious advantage for jeb bush is that he 's seen this playbook run before .                            
0 1 he may be able to come up with a better strategy than mitt .                                
1 0 if he 's to succeed , he better .

0 0 he 's bumped up in the polls thanks to some good speeches .                                  
0 0 but what 's interesting is what he 's done with that .                                    
0 0 he has been hired a lot of staffers .                                          
0 0 he has been as aggressive as jeb bush in making phone calls , in hiring staff , digital people , fundraisers .                
0 0 he hired a big deal fund-raiser from the nrcc , jenny drucker .                                  
0 0 this is really interesting to watch because the invisible primary is not just about poll numbers and who 's up , who 's down ; it 's what you 're
0 0 and he 's actually done a lot especially with the departure of mitt romney from the field going after those donors and going after staff .        
0 0 they 've had a lot of people actually coming to them with resumes in the last few weeks .

0 0 he 'll tour with them .                                                
0 0 not certain yet whether or not he 'll actually make an endorsement .                                  
0 0 someone asked him whether or not lindsey graham runs whether or not that would be an automatic endorsement .                      
0 0 he said maybe , maybe not .                                              
1 0 he did n't endorse last time .

0 0 they say they do n't want it to just be a talk-a-thon ; that any major speaker will have to answer questions so they 're going to do it in
0 0 they 'll going to try to have as many of the candidates on stage as they can maybe an anchor asking them questions .            
0 0 maybe have their board member asking questions , have people from the audience ask them questions .                          
0 0 and that 's part of the conservative political action conference trying to say to republicans , we 're going to play a role in vetting these people .    
0 0 here 's what they look like without a teleprompter .

0 0 but critics wonder whether to trust that answer , whether her way was a deliberate strategy to delay or defy legitimate requests for documents about taxpayer business and whether her
0 0 so ron fournier , you 've covered clintons for a long time and you have this debate .                        
0 0 team clinton says , listen , you 're blowing this out of proportion .                                
0 0 it 's a media feeding frenzy .                                              
0 0 it 's a republican feeding frenzy .                                              
0 0 critics say , wait a minute , we do n't know so many things --                              
1 0 i 'm going to it 's not critics say .                                        
0 0 it 's anybody with a brain in their head and is n't in the tank for the clintons .                      
0 0 i mean this is a very clear violation of the regulations .                                    
0 0 it 's a very clear violation of the spirit of the regulation .                                  
0 0 those are our e-mails -- they 're not hers .                                        
0 0 she server should be put forward .                                              
0 0 she never should have tried to skirt it .                                          
0 0 it 's not even a matter of debate .                                          
0 0 i mean this is an issue she 's created .                                        
0 0 it 's an issue she can solve .                                            
0 0 i 'll go back .                                                  
0 0 let 's go way back to two weeks ago to the foundation , the fact that the foundation was taking foreign money .              
0 0 i think that 's actually even a bigger controversy because we all grew up around the watergate hearings learning that you have to follow the money , follow the money
0 0 i think there are some really big questions about the nexus between foreign donations to the foundation , corporate donations to the foundation and potential conflicts of interest .  
0 0 and for us to follow that money we have to go through those e-mails .                              
0 0 those e-mails should be a public document .                                            
1 0 those e-mails should be a public document .                                            
0 0 lisa , the president of the united states when he was campaigning and then when he took office , they lined everybody in the room , they all raised their
0 0 he said it will be the most transparent administration in history .                                    
0 0 we do know that the white house sent word early on that they wanted people -- look , people in the bush administration did this , too .    
0 0 let 's make that clear .                                                
0 0 this is not a brand-new practice .                                              
0 0 hillary clinton was not alone in using a private account .                                      
0 0 the question is whether she should have known better , whether she should have followed boss ' direction who said my preference is you use a government account .  
0 0 and whether you be transparent she 's in control of the records which makes it hard to say she 's transparent .                
0 0 here 's the president of the united states talking to cbs ' bill plante whether -- he asked -- bill plante asked the president whether he thinks hillary clinton kept
1 0 you say that you have the most transparent administration ever .                                      
0 0 you 've said it again just a couple of weeks ago .                                    
1 0 it 's true .                                                    
1 0 how does this square with that ?                                              
1 1 well , i think that the fact that she 's going to be putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need .
1 0 that 's the `` i did n't really wish -- i wish you had n't asked that question , '' but she will be transparent so that meets the test
0 0 he 's being nice , right ?                                              
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 yes .                                                        
0 1 i mean it certainly has raised a lot of questions for the interaction .                                
0 0 this was the first real test of how the nascent hillary campaign will interact with the white house .                      
0 0 and it does n't really seem like they passed it with flying colors .                                
0 0 but i think there are certainly a lot of substantive policy questions like the kind you 're raising .                      
0 0 but there are also political strategy questions here .                                          
0 0 like one thing we learned this week was that the white house knew about this or found out about this in august which frankly is a little bit late .
0 0 but it 's still an awfully long time before march and an awfully long time before she was talking about launching a formal campaign .          
0 0 so i think a lot of democrats around town have been saying to me and saying to other people , why was n't this handled back in august months and
0 0 get this out there , deal with it , have this buffer of more than six months to have these things processed through ?            
0 0 instead you have this whole scandal , all of these questions coming out just weeks before she 's ready --                    
1 1 real quickly , the president was n't being nice .                                        
0 0 that was a cover up by semantics .                                            
0 0 the only answer he should be giving is i want that server back , secretary clinton .                          
0 0 that belongs to the people .                                                
0 0 that belongs to this administration .                                                
0 0 give me that server .                                                  
0 0 that 's the right answer .                                                
1 0 but not the first time that democrats have had public support , private trepidation when the clintons are involved in a conversation that involves secrecy .        
1 0 no doubt about it .                                                  
0 0 and what this has given republicans on a silver platter is a new reason to ask these questions .                      
0 0 people had largely forgotten about the benghazi committee .                                          
0 0 that 's why this is all coming up right now .                                      
0 0 this has fueled what was essentially an old fire but this is now going to go on forever because there are new subpoenas , new investigations .      
0 0 so exactly what 's happening now , there is going to -- throughout the duration of her presidential campaign there 's likely to be a congressional investigation .    
0 0 you 're right .                                                    
0 0 had they sort of dealt with this six months ago it would not be as hot of an issue at this point .              
0 0 so fueling these old flames to me seems so politically questionable why they thought that this would not explode at this point .              
1 0 this is christmas in march for republicans .                                            
0 0 christmas came late this year if you 're in the house republican party .                                
1 0 christmas in march -- i like that .                                            
0 0 one of the questions though , you mentioned bill clinton and the foreign contributions .                              
0 0 one of the questions , everything she does will be reflected on him as well and his history and his secrecy and the investigations about him .      
0 0 and that 's what republicans are hoping that people just say we do n't want to go back to that .                  
0 1 we do n't want to go back to the clinton days .                                    
0 0 you mentioned the foreign contributions and it is mind numbing to me that when she was secretary of state the president of the united states said , ca n't do
0 1 no foreign contributions .                                                    
0 0 and for the most part they agreed , there were some exceptions to that rule .                            
0 1 then she left office and they started taking contributions again from foreign governments .                                
0 0 listen to bill clinton here saying , look , we 're transparent about this .                              
0 0 do n't worry .                                                    
1 0 i agree with all the foreign policy of saudi arabia ?                                      
0 1 no .                                                        
0 0 my theory about all of this is disclose everything and then let people make their judgments .                          
0 0 but i think there are more than 300,000 people , you should know this , who in some form or fashion have contributed money to the work we 've done
0 1 and i believe we 've done a lot more good than harm .                                  
0 0 i believe this is a good thing .                                            
1 0 there is no question the clinton foundation does some remarkable work around the world .                              
0 0 however , he says disclose everything and everything is ok .                                      
0 0 if it was just him , just a former president , i could process that .                            
0 0 but you know the whole time while she 's -- a , she was secretary of state ; and b , she 's probably going to run for president .
0 0 is n't that a higher standard ?                                              
1 0 i think it absolutely is .                                                
0 0 and you 're seeing that right now .                                            
0 0 i mean if there 's not more disclosure , that 's going to pose a problem for them .                      
0 0 and of course , this is just like -- these are questions you do n't want to be answering as you launch your presidential campaign and we 'll , of
0 0 so i think that 's the big question here is that she 's forcing us into an uncomfortable position .                    
0 0 it gives republicans -- particularly republicans in the house a lot of ammunition to run with .                          
0 1 and i think that this is going to dominate a lot of what she probably hoped would be a clean launch for a campaign .          
1 0 john , as you know , there 's been a lot of whispers about pay to play from inside the clinton team .              
0 1 pay to play at the foundation .                                              
0 0 those are going to become shouts unless she releases all of the e-mails .                                
1 0 but one question of the questions is `` do republicans overreach ? ''                                  
0 0 the history of the clintons is -- forgive me -- you had the monica lewinsky scandal and two republican speakers lost their jobs because the public perceived that republicans --
0 1 i want you to listen to ted cruz here .                                        
0 0 he 's talking about -- he 's in iowa this weekend -- he 's talking about this e-mail controversy and look there are very legitimate issues about why was this
0 0 listen to ted cruz 's take .                                              
1 1 well , the allegations that have been raised against hillary clinton appear very serious and on the face of it , it certainly seems that her conduct was in substantial
0 0 and so there needs to be an investigation as to whether she violated the criminal laws of the united states .                  
0 0 and that rule should apply to her just as it applies to everyone else in america .                          
1 0 turn them over , disclose them , give us a full accounting -- i get it completely .                        
0 0 is it safe ground for republicans to be saying `` violated the laws of the united states '' ?                      
0 0 may have violated the laws of the united states ?                                        
1 0 you 're absolutely right on the overreach because that is the pattern that 's happened over the years .                      
0 0 it could happen again here .                                                
0 0 i think -- again , we do n't know what 's in the e-mails .                              
0 0 are voters -- are democratic voters going to be concerned about this ?                                  
0 0 no .                                                        
0 0 i think the most important part is it shows sort of how nimble they are in handling things like this .                  
0 0 this has not been handled at all .                                            
0 0 she still has n't talked about it .                                            
0 0 she needs to talk about it .                                              
0 0 but overreach is definitely something that republican leaders are slightly worried about .                                  
0 0 speaker boehner has essentially kept pretty tight control over these committees not overreaching .                                
0 0 we 'll see if that continues .                                              
1 0 you say not handled well but i think this is part of the disconnect .                              
0 0 the clintons think this is the way we do things .                                      
0 0 we react when necessary .                                                  
0 0 we do the minimal amount to disclose .                                            
0 0 then we 'll move forward .                                                
0 0 the state department investigation will take months .                                            
0 1 they think it 's worked for us in the past and it will work again , do n't they .                    
1 1 yes , they do .                                                  
0 0 what they do n't realize is the world has changed .                                      
0 0 in the 15 years since there was a clinton in the oval office , we have little thing called the internet .                
0 0 it changed the media landscape .                                                
0 0 back in the 90s there was 12 gate keepers basically .                                      
0 0 if we decided not to print something at the associated press where you and i worked , people did n't find out about it .          
0 0 now there 's 300 million reporters and researchers .                                          
0 0 they can see through the spin .                                              
0 0 they can see through the lies .                                              
0 0 they can see the conflicts of interest .                                            
0 0 so i think , you know , this is going to be less about will the republicans overreach and are the democrats playing it right and just the facts .
0 0 those are government e-mails .                                                  
0 0 she did violate government regulations .                                                
0 0 turn over the e-mails .                                                  
0 0 turn back the contributions and the story 's over .                                        
0 0 it 's that simple .                                                  
1 0 and it 's also particularly damaging because it plays exactly into the narrative that republicans have been setting up for a year which is that this is the old hillary
0 0 she left the state department with the sky high approval ratings .                                    
0 0 she had remade her image and they wanted to bring us back to the 90s .                            
0 0 this is about secrecy .                                                  
0 0 this is about people will do anything for political gain .                                      
0 0 and this plays right into that .                                              
0 0 so is an individual voter going to say , you know what , i am or am not voting for hillary clinton based on this e-mail issue ?    
0 0 that seems a little hard to see .                                            
0 0 does this play into a larger narrative ?                                            
0 0 for most people , let 's be honest , they 're not paying attention to the presidential race .                      
0 0 we 're still pretty far out .                                              
0 0 republicans are getting the chance to set the narrative about her very early and that is --                          
1 0 and let 's be honest , a lot of voters do n't remember the clinton days .                          
0 0 a lot of voters are too young to remember 15 or 20 years ago .                              
0 1 to your point , most people in camp clinton think this will be fine , this will pass .                      
0 0 the election will be about the economy .                                            
0 0 it will be about foreign policy .                                              
0 0 but i did talk to one veteran of the last clinton administration .                                  
0 0 he said the big question is to ron 's point , transparency and authenticity matter more now because of the media clamor .              
0 0 we 'll see .                                                    
0 0 next , selma 50 years later and what the commemoration tells us about today 's politics .                          
0 0 first though in `` politicians say the darnedest things '' .                                      
0 0 hillary clinton and that infamous dress .                                              
1 0 i want to answer one question right at the start before it stirs up twitter .                            
0 0 over the years people have read a lot of different things into my pantsuits , so let 's settle this once and for all .          
0 0 despite what you might think , this outfit is not actually white and gold .                              
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 crowds will be back at the edmund pettus bridge in selma , alabama to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday .                
0 0 yesterday our country 's first african-american president stood at the bridge and declared we know the march is not over yet .                
0 0 it 's a moment in history worth remembering .                                          
0 0 it 's also a moment in politics .                                            
0 0 first let 's just take a look at this , the iconic photo of 50 years ago -- dr. king , coretta scott king beginning to march in selma .
0 0 yesterday at the commemoration , the vip list of politicians including the president of the united states , the former president george w. bush .          
0 0 one of the big debates in washington as the week ended was why was n't the house republican leadership going to be represented ?            
0 0 at the last minute , kevin mccarthy he did go -- the number two in republican leadership .                        
0 0 mostly democrats -- jeff sessions , republican senator born in selma , tim scott from south carolina -- they 're at the event .            
0 0 this is about history .                                                  
0 0 that 's the reason they all should have been there .                                      
0 0 it 's about history -- an iconic event , a seminal event in our history .                            
0 0 but it 's also about politics .                                              
0 0 if you think about presidential politics into the next cycle if you look at this president obama in 2012 , 93 percent of the african- american vote ; the republicans
0 0 in 2008 , 95 percent ; the republicans got 4 .                                      
0 0 the last time they were in the white house in 2004 , george w. bush did get 11 percent .                    
0 0 this is an important number going forward .                                            
0 0 should that be part of the selma conversation ?                                          
0 0 that 's a debatable point .                                                
0 0 but jeff zeleny , you were there in 2007 , hillary clinton and barack obama were there .                        
0 0 i 'm sort of flummoxed by the idea that if you 're the republican party and you know your biggest dilemma in presidential politics is non-white votes -- latinos and
0 0 why not make a bigger deal of this ?                                          
0 1 why not join as president bush did to his credit .                                      
0 0 why not just say this is a day to mark history .                                    
0 0 it 's bipartisan .                                                    
0 0 nobody can have the political conversation if you all show up ?                                    
1 0 it 's a question i ask so many republican offices and no answer .                                
0 0 i do n't think they realized how significant this will be .                                    
0 0 of all the things that speaker boehner and senator mitch mcconnell ca n't control and there are a lot .                    
0 0 this is one thing they could have controlled .                                          
0 0 fly down there on a government plane and do this .                                      
0 0 but more -- the presidential candidates -- all of them were in iowa yesterday campaigning for the iowa caucuses .                    
0 0 why were n't more of them there ?                                            
0 0 why were n't any of them there ?                                            
0 0 so it is an absolute point .                                              
0 0 the next democratic nominee is probably not going to be an african-american so it gives republicans a big chance to return to those '04 numbers .        
0 0 but it makes it very difficult when they 're not reaching out doing the easy things like this .                      
1 0 if you want to make progress , you have to start somewhere .                                  
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 i mean looking at the party overall , right , the republican party has struggled for the past decade or more with seeming like party of inclusion as the country
0 0 this was an easy opportunity as jeff pointed out for them to change that image .                            
0 0 you know , whether they win 11 percent of the african-american vote or 4 percent of them , it 's sort of about their global macro level image and they
1 0 whether you agree or disagree with this president 's poll six , he 's made history .                          
0 0 he 's our first african-american president .                                              
0 0 it is 50 years since the march on selma .                                        
0 0 that 's what brought the voting rights act to america .                                      
0 0 watch the speech he gave yesterday if you have n't seen .                                    
0 0 a very speech that touched on the history of this and yes , the president of the united states is aware of the politics of the moment too .  
0 0 listen here as he responds to recent critics who suggest maybe he does n't love america .                          
1 1 that 's what it means to love america .                                          
0 0 that 's what it means to believe in america .                                        
0 0 that 's what it means when we say america is exceptional , not stock photos or air brushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more american
1 0 `` not stock photos or air brushed history or '' , juana , `` feeble attempts to define some of us as more american than others '' .    
0 0 some people will say do n't politicize selma .                                          
0 0 the president did right there .                                                
0 0 he was answering his recent critics .                                              
1 0 he absolutely was .                                                    
0 0 and i think that there is a large camp of people on the left who will say that those critics are very racially motivated .          
0 0 this is an important moment .                                                
0 0 i was surprised to see the republican leadership 's response to not to attend the event .                          
0 0 but remember when we 're talking about ferguson , where we 're talking about eric garner , where we see another young unarmed black man killed by police in wisconsin
0 0 so this is a really important political moment .                                          
0 0 it will be interesting to see just long we are actually talking about the fact -- i know the people i talked to who are outside the beltway , they
0 0 what they remember is that republicans did n't show up .                                      
0 0 and i think that 's why it can become --                                        
1 1 neither of the clintons showed up , either .                                          
1 1 exactly .                                                        
1 0 they had their big event in san francisco .                                          
1 0 first , was this a political speech ?                                            
0 1 yes , it was a political speech .                                            
0 0 selma was a political event --                                                
1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 thank god .                                                      
0 0 secondly , look who was there from the republican party .                                      
0 0 president bush .                                                      
0 0 the fact that president bush was there -- the last man who did authorize the vote and --                        
0 0 yes -- there 's a reason why more people should follow president bush 's example .                            
0 0 then lastly , i tell you , the president 's speech in that moment was worthy of grant .                      
0 0 that will be covered in grant .                                              
0 0 that was an incredible speech .                                                
0 0 that was american exceptionalism .                                                  
0 0 we can take that canard off the table .                                          
1 0 the race confrontation will continue in the campaign without our african-american president .                                  
0 0 next , our reporters give you a sneak peek into their notebooks including an upcoming visit to iowa that hillary clinton might find just a tad inconvenient .    
0 0 let 's head around the inside politics table and ask our great reporters to get you out ahead of the big political news just around the corner .    
0 0 lisa , what have you got ?                                              
1 1 well john , all eyes will be on senator rand paul this month as we near the deadline for talks on nuclear policy between iran and the united states .
0 0 he 's been trying to shore up his foreign policy credentials , satisfy his hawkish -- more hawkish elements of the republican party .            
0 0 this past week he signed on as a co-sponsor to legislation giving congress final say over any approval that -- any deal that 's struck by the administration .  
0 0 it 's unlikely to be enough to satisfy parts of the republican base and also satisfy key donors for the party who are very concerned about israel .    
0 0 he also came under fire this past week for not applauding vociferously enough during israeli prime minister bibi netanyahu 's speech .                
0 0 i think a lot of eyes will be on him this month as we delve into these issues .                      
1 0 a fascinating place for him .                                                
0 0 keep your ron paul base move into rand paul space .                                      
0 0 ron .                                                        
1 0 jeb bush , former governor of florida is going to be doubling down on his contrast with hillary clinton on transparency .                
0 0 we already know that he released selected e-mails -- self-selected e- mails from his time in florida and issued one chapter of his book .          
0 0 what we did n't know is he 's in negotiations -- serious negotiations with amazon for a big memoir deal that would have the full memoir published across other platforms
0 0 it will include -- use the e-mails to kind of draw a narrative of his time in florida ; the highs , the lows , but also some mistakes and
1 0 coming soon to a kindle near you .                                            
1 0 there you go .                                                    
1 0 keep an eye on that .                                                
0 0 juana .                                                        
1 1 it is probably an understatement to say that last week was not a particularly pretty week in the house of representatives and things are n't going to get any easier
0 0 house lawmakers now have to deal with the so-called doc fix , the highway trust fund budget resolutions , appropriations and all that before getting to october or november 's
0 0 and that raises two really big political questions i 'm going to be watching over the next couple of weeks .                  
0 0 the first is , was what we saw with the department of homeland security an isolated flap or is this a pattern by house speaker john boehner ?    
0 0 are they antagonizing the conservatives in his party ?                                          
0 0 and the second question is when it comes to big deal legislation like this is boehner willing to continually going to antagonize the far-right wing of his party and pass
0 0 and that i think will tell us a lot about what this congress will look like in the next few years to come .            
1 0 the next chapter of government by chaos .                                            
0 0 mr. zeleny ?                                                      
1 1 a lot of talk about is there going to be another democrat jumping in .                              
0 0 keep your eye out for cedar rapids , iowa for al gore .                                  
0 0 al gore is making his first trip back to iowa in perhaps more a decade .                            
0 0 he says he 's not running .                                              
0 0 i 'm sure he 's not .                                              
0 0 but he 's doing a climate leadership workshop .                                          
0 0 so this is getting everyone there sort of excited and buzzing .                                    
0 0 so by then hillary clinton will probably already be in the race but democrats in iowa who are hungry for a different type of politics might be signing up for
0 0 so al gore back on the road .                                            
1 0 the return of al gore .                                                
1 0 it could n't be better .                                                
1 0 let 's take the show on the road .                                          
0 0 it could n't be better .                                                
0 0 you 're absolutely right .

0 0 one of the big early tests for presidential candidates to prove you can raise the money , the big money for the long haul , especially in a wide open
0 0 the first lap in the money chase ends at the end of this month .                              
0 0 that 's when candidates have to report their first quarter fundraising tolls .                                  
0 0 there 's no doubt the big headline will be the strength of the jeb bush money machine .                        
0 0 and there 's a bit of an expectations game under way as we head into the final weeks of the quarter .                
0 0 team bush got a bit dismayed when several allies early on started talking about a record-smashing $ 100 million quarter for his right to rise political action committee .  
0 0 now some bush allies are bragging a $ 50 million figure would still be a big deal .                        
0 0 are they trying to surely lower expectations or just create space so that a bigger number will be a bigger deal ?                
0 1 well , we 'll know in just three weeks .                                        
0 0 that 's it for inside politics .

sentence: 
    ... they turned into a surrogate and to great effect or there are some people thinking maybe alicia machado can be the same thing .          
    we talked about the president , we talked former president clinton , we talked about all these elected politicians for hillary clinton , is a real person help more ?
    i think that in this case , i think it was -- i 've been clear that it was obviously self-destructive for him to bring her up the day after
0 0 on the other hand , the clinton campaign has a little bit of issue here because of her past which according to some cnn and a.p .      
0 0 reporting from back in the day , she had some ties to some venezuelan criminals and the crimes that they did .                
0 0 and so i think in the political parlance , i know mr. khan , you may ever know mr. khan .                  
0 0 mr. khan was an unassailable surrogate and i think this one will be slightly different .                            
0 1 but i think the theme of the attack is not bad .                                    
1 1 yes .                                                        
0 0 i mean it 's attacking her weight and you know , bringing that up pro actively , i mean , regardless of her past it 's not a good thing
0 1 i asked senator mcconnell this yesterday and speaker ryan about machado -- criticism in machado .                            
0 0 what they did was they dodged it completely .                                          
0 0 they did n't want to touch it .                                            
0 0 neither did any republican .                                                  
0 0 they 're not going to defend this , and so the trump campaign was n't very happy that he voluntarily brought this up himself , which one reason why they
1 0 it was interesting because she brought it up in the debate , it was clearly a planned moment , they 'd done this research , they 'd also apparently helped
0 0 this is how a smart campaign operates .                                            
0 0 you plan things like this .                                                
0 0 he was like , `` where did you get this ?                                      
0 0 where did you get this ? ''                                              
0 0 he seemed a little indignant in the debate , but as you mentioned yesterday morning on `` fox news '' , listen to donald trump , instead , you know
1 0 so that person was a miss universe person , and she was the worst we ever had , the worst , the absolute worst .          
0 0 she was impossible .                                                    
1 0 did n't know that story .                                                
0 0 i did n't know either .                                                
1 0 she was the winner , and , you know , she gained a massive amount of weight , and it was -- it was a real problem .    
1 0 this stuff is so easy , i mean it 's so easy to get it right and yet somehow they do n't seem to prepare him for these kinds of
0 1 i mean , i think mary katharine is right .                                        
0 0 she may not be the perfect sort of model for anything , really .                                
0 0 but the point is , when women look at the video that the clinton campaign put out hours after the debate , and they listen to what she had to
1 0 can you see some of that video on the screen .                                      
1 0 very easy for her to understand what that 's about .                                      
0 0 and all trump has to do is not talk about it .                                    
0 0 and may be apologize for it , or move on .                                      
1 0 or say that 's a different phase of my life .                                      
1 0 i got an e-mail from a republican in one of the swing states , who said , who was beside himself about this , and then about the whole debate
0 0 he did n't limit it to latinos .                                            
0 1 just ...                                                        
1 1 women in this country .                                                  
1 0 just probably women in the suburbs .                                              
1 0 he came into the debate with momentum .                                            
0 0 it did happens at key moments , let 's just to see what happens .                              
0 0 we 're going to go back to our breaking news .                                      
0 0 i 'll show you picture now of the united states senate .                                    
0 0 the united states senate has voted to override the president 's veto .                                  
0 0 this has never happened 7.5 plus years of the obama presidency , a veto has not been over and this is one chamber .            
0 0 now , we move on to the house still that the senate was considered .                              
0 1 manu raju with us here knows a lot more about the congress than i do considered the tougher chamber , right ?                
1 1 yeah .                                                        
1 0 ... in terms of getting the two-thirds majority in this legislation would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia , seeking some damages .        
0 0 now saudi arabia says of course it 's was not a state player in terrorism but many of the actors the terrorist on 9/11 were from saudi arabia .  
0 0 where 's this go from here ?                                              
1 0 looks like the house is going to pass this probably as early as tomorrow .                              
0 0 the administration has been lobbying behind the scenes to kill this in the senate , because they 're worried about potentially opening up americans overseas to lawsuits or retaliatory actions
0 1 that fell on deaf ears .                                                
0 0 this is such a sensitive issue .                                              
0 0 democrats and republicans i know that they 've read the side with in that families of 9/11 that saved the saudi government but that did n't stop obama from calling
0 0 their only recourse is perhaps to reopen the negotiations after it becomes law in a lame duck session of congress .                  
0 0 we 'll see if they 're able to get support from that , because right now they do n't have much .                
1 0 in the sense , if he just held his own democrats , could 've kept him from getting to two-thirds .                  
0 0 republicans have 54 in an election year , too dicey ?                                      
1 0 notably the clinton campaign is on the other side of the white house on this and it 's because it 's just a hard issue for them to defend .
0 0 i mean the days going into the debate they knew there was a chance that this thing could come up .                  
0 0 i do n't think it did , but they thought that it was possible , and she 's not siding with obama on this not rare thing in this election
1 0 he 's actually got more support from republicans than democrats , even paul ryan is receptive to a lot of the white house concerns as well as bob corker the
0 0 warren hatch , so perhaps they can go back into it after it becomes law .                            
1 0 yeah , some things are close , might be hard to come back into , when you look at this one after the election .          
0 0 some things are close .                                                  
0 0 they need a two-thirds , 97 to 1 .                                          
0 0 97 to 1 was the vote in the united states senator and our producer on do the walls on capitol hill , one of best in the business says actually
0 1 i 'm moving quickly to the house that 's own embarrassment for the president of the united states is 2016 campaign issue or more of an obama legacy issue ?
1 1 yeah , i think this is more of like i 'm just going to lame duck this thing out .                    
0 0 you know , it 's not great for him .                                        
0 0 but if something as 9/11 victims in the title , you have to go to the mats for that if you want to stick with this veto .    
0 0 and the president has not historically been great at picking up the phone a ton of times and doing a lot of the canoodling necessary for this kind of thing
1 0 97 to 1 , lyndon baines johnson might had taken a little bit even for this .                          
0 0 the president , you 're right .                                              
0 0 president does have a problem with those kind relationships .                                        
0 0 but on 97 to 1 suggest you want to have a since we 're on subject on capitol hill , this is an embarrassment for the president .    
0 0 for the last couple days , we 've talking about the prospect of an election year government shutdown because this place is one of donald trump 's biggest and most
0 1 that has dissipated , correct ?                                                
0 0 and the big hang up there where democrats were insisting that they wanted money for flint , michigan .                      
0 0 they wanted the republicans to support some money for the people of flint , michigan , for the infrastructure of flint , michigan to help when there 's a breakdown
1 0 looks like they 're going to get a deal , the pass to keep the government open , pass the friday funding deadline , include funding for the zika outbreak
0 0 deal with aid from the louisiana flooding and then move this flint package separately .                              
0 0 that would actually be enacted in december .                                            
0 0 republicans realized their a tough spot on that issue , particularly as donald trump himself going to flint , michigan talking about this issue , talking about the flint water
0 0 republicans wanted to deal with that but deal with it separately from this government funding package .                          
0 0 some conservatives are not happy about that because they knew this is a bailout for flint , michigan .                      
0 0 so there will be some potentially some theatrics this week but we expect those votes to pass in the coming days .                
0 0 as early as today .                                                  
1 0 and i assume we 're getting these votes all of the sudden and getting things passed and done because they have the same calendar we do .      
0 0 and its 41 days to election and they all want to go home campaign is that the idea ?                      
1 1 right .                                                        
1 0 and in campaign the entire month of october is done .                                      
1 0 shocking how -- felt like nothing like scheduling election to get the congress to do its job , right ?                    
0 0 self-preservation , it 's a good role in politics .                                        
0 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 a little rock and roll today .                                              
0 0 but up next , back to some of michele obama in the campaign trail for hillary clinton here more of what she said , coming up .      
0 0 we took you live at the other top of the program , first lady michelle obama out campaigning for hillary clinton , she 's in philadelphia today .    
0 0 important she 's on a college campus .                                            
0 0 she spoke out about donald trump and the birther question .                                      
1 0 and then , of course , there are those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years whether my husband was even born in this country .
0 0 and let me say , hurtful , deceitful questions deliberately designed to undermine his presidency .                            
0 0 questions that can not be blamed on others or swept under the rug by an insincere sentence uttered at a press conference .              
0 0 let me take a moment .                                                
0 0 but during his turn in office i think barack has answered these questions with the example he set and the dignity he 's shown by going high when they go
1 0 we could debate going high , going low , but she wants that in the public square , she wants -- they want this conversation to the point you made
0 0 it was interesting in the debate , lester holt tried again , in the statement he made , donald trump spent more time giving propaganda promotions for his new hotel
0 0 and he would n't take questions about it .                                          
0 0 has n't explained why for five years after the president released his birth certificate .                              
0 0 never mind the period before that .                                              
0 0 he still kept saying i think it 's a fraud .                                      
0 0 i met with people who say it 's a fraud .                                      
0 0 in the debate then he was asked about this and he said , `` i say nothing , i say nothing . ''              
0 0 the democrats clearly think this is a way to motivate not just the african-american vote but to peel away suburban moderates who might think , `` i ca n't vote
1 0 yeah , and the way he handled it in the debate was another example of why this continues to be a problem for him .          
0 0 i mean though he can say 100 times i , you know , want to move on to other things .                  
0 0 and that 's why i said what i said .                                        
0 0 but the way he tried to again pin it on hillary clinton 's campaign .                              
0 0 i thought she was effective in ignoring the piece of what he said and simply going straight to what he had actually done and take the fight back to him
1 0 and 20 electoral votes in the state of pennsylvania where michelle obama is today and what 's worthy about it is it 's not hard .        
0 0 when you look at the state of pennsylvania , donald trump will win vast swaths of pennsylvania , to called it democratic which they 've done since 1988 , you
0 0 it 's one of the states where democrats do n't get to use their advantage when it comes to organization , data , voter identification and outreach .    
0 0 vice president biden was there , president obama was there recently and michelle obama back there .                          
0 0 that 's not an accident .                                                
1 0 no it 's not it 's a risk too for republicans .                                    
0 0 i mean the state and cycle after cycle republicans view pennsylvania as something that could come in their column .                    
0 0 remember in 2012 , romney saw this as a possibility .                                      
0 0 they put a lot of emphasis on this late it did n't turn out that way .                          
0 0 but this time , polls do show this is very close in pennsylvania perhaps they can win , but it 's an expensive state to campaign in .    
0 0 they have to spend a lot of money in the philadelphia media markets , if they do want to win .                  
0 0 and it seems like that -- that trump is taking it seriously .                                  
1 0 and if you listen , obviously , we keep using the term personal .

0 0 some polls show right around 50 , some of that a bit higher than 50 .                            
0 0 but how important , how big is the obama factor ?                                      
1 0 obama factor is very big .                                                
0 0 i mean if his approval rating were 53 or 54 , we would say hillary clinton has got wind at her backs as supposed to over this thing a change
0 0 he 's right at the trust .

0 0 so he trying to do everything he can to leverage himself , to leverage his popularity particularly among the people that they need to turn out in big numbers .
0 0 they do n't just need a big margin among african-americans , they need big numbers in terms of turnout .                    
1 0 and yet , it also is -- i mean this is the world we live in .                          
0 0 two campaigns trying to do two very different things turning out their vote .                                
0 0 they 're not competing for that many of the same people .                                    
0 0 that 's not that much of a middle anymore .

0 0 responding to that part of him but scared what he offers i think pennsylvania because their ground game is may be slightly less important , it 's helpful to him
0 1 and i think had it not been for a decent performance by her in the debate this week , the pennsylvania numbers would be panic button mode , but nonetheless
1 0 that she went from plus 8 or plus 9 to plus about 2 to 4 depending what polling you believe in about a month .          
0 0 it 's going to be really interesting by the end of this week to see the real polls after the debate fallout , check on the battleground states .  
0 1 very , very interesting .

0 0 clarissa explains millennials , the actress melissa joan hart who played clarissa in '90s nickelodeon show , has said that she is signing up with johnson 's campaign as a
0 0 i just think this is emblematic , because , clarissa , especially for me , is a bit of a millennial icon that we all kind of grew up with
0 0 because millennials really do feel like i want to do this the right way , i do n't want to do something reluctantly and this is how i 'm going
1 1 all right .

1 1 the next debate is the vice presidential debate , as everybody knows and four years ago joe biden helped president obama recover among nervous democrats after the president 's bad
0 0 mike pence is in a similar position .                                            
0 0 he 's got to do something to try to bring back the enthusiasm around the trump campaign .                        
0 0 and talking to people about what to look for in this campaign , a , that tim kaine will prosecute the case as much as he can to force pence

1 1 john , republicans are getting bullish about , keeping control of congress , the house and the senate .                      
0 0 kevin mccarthy , the house majority leader said this week that he thinks the republicans connection , pick up seats in the house .            
0 0 are we expected all along that they would lose seats , if they lose 30 , they lose the house majority .                
0 0 but he thinks they could win seats .                                            
0 0 out of the senate , side , polls are looking better for senate republicans .                              
0 0 mitch mcconnell , however , the majority leader is warning folks internally not to get too excited .                        
0 0 they need to focus in october .                                              
0 0 donors need to put more money into those states and watch for the terrain in the senate states to go to red states , missouri , indiana , north carolina
0 0 that 's where the battleground is going to be in october for the next senate majority .                          
1 0 and to watch that wo n't say i will forget sometimes , the presidential race , you forget tough ones there , abby ?            
1 0 so one big thing that came out of the debate monday night was that donald trump is n't really going to change the way he explains his actions around the
0 0 and that 's a big opening for the clinton campaign who had been looking for sort of something more concrete to kind of get at how trump might handle the
0 0 and they have really strong ammunition .                                              
0 0 we 've already seen some ads coming out talking about how trump has paid no taxes .                          
0 0 i think this could be an opportunity for them to pivot back to the economy .                            
0 0 we 've seen some slippage in the polls in terms of whether americans think she can handle it better than him .                
0 0 they need this opening in order to turn that around .                                      
1 0 fascinating to watching that one .

1 0 nia-malika henderson of `` the washington post '' , jonathan martin of `` the new york times '' , cnn 's peter hamby and politico maggie haberman .    
0 0 the veterans health scandal is much more than just another broken 2008 promise .                                
1 0 i revere our soldiers and want to make sure that they are being treated with honor and respect .                      
1 0 fast forward six years and more than two dozen va facilities now suspected of covering up delays in getting veterans urgent care in sometimes with deadly consequences .    
1 0 we have to find out , first of all , what exactly happened .                                
1 0 now that moment that wait-and-see statement last wednesday at the white house might well be remembered as the breaking point .                  
1 0 president obama , the most powerful man in the free world always seems to be the last to know about what 's going on in his own administration .  
1 0 forget for a moment that republican outrage .                                            
0 0 more and more democrats in key 2014 races are calling for the president to get a spine , they say , and fire his veterans affairs secretary and what more
0 0 maggie haberman , that 's what strikes me , what democrats are saying privately in the wake of the healthcare.gov problems , they see a president , does n't want
0 0 some democrats who believe in government saying this white house does n't appear to have its hand on the lever .                  
1 0 yes and you 've heard for a long time this white house does n't appear to quite have its hand on the lever at various points .      
0 0 but this week really marked something , this past week marked a change where you saw obama with that very sort of tepid press conference , he was sort of
0 0 he had a meeting about foreign policy with senators who were expecting him to be there .                          
0 0 he was n't there .

0 0 one of them said that he thought it was the most bizarre meeting he had been in , in quite a while .              
0 0 all of this adds up to somebody who just does n't seem at all involved .                            
0 0 this is problematic for democrats who on the one hand can use individual instances to separate from their party .                    
0 0 but the collective weight of this is problematic .                                          
1 0 he also for -- since he 's been in office , he 's seemed temperamentally at odds with the impulses of washington .              
0 0 people want there to be a head , they want to lop off someone head and fire him .                      
0 0 obama -- the entire presidency has been calm deliberative his default gear is that sort of lawyerly demeanor .                      
0 0 i want answers first , i 'm not going to show you outrage .                                
1 1 right .

1 1 right .                                                        
1 1 but in washington it 's very tough to do .                                        
1 0 well and it depends also on what type of a situation you 're talking about .                            
0 0 the shinseki issue , the va scandal , really is emotional .                                    
0 0 it 's a gut issue involves veterans , gets it involves health involves , caring for people .                        
0 0 this is different then --                                                  
1 1 and if you are going to speak , if you 're the commander-in- chief and you 've been under pressure for days , even a couple of weeks to speak
0 0 i 'm in charge i want to just play listen you know eric shinseki is still the veterans affairs secretary , although if you listen to the president here ,
1 0 i want to see what the results of these reports are and there is going to be accountability .                      
0 0 i am going to make sure that there is accountability throughout the system after i get the full report .                    
0 0 if he thinks he 's led our veterans down , then i 'm sure that he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve .      
1 0 you can make somebody walk the plank .                                            
0 0 you can take the plank away to make clear that you stand by them .                              
0 0 it seems right there that he sort of sent eric shinseki out to stand halfway down the plank .                      
0 0 henderson : that 's right and shinseki so far has said he does n't want to get anywhere near this plank .                
0 0 he does n't have any intention of resigning .                                          
0 0 we are talking about this in terms of politics .                                        
0 0 i talked to several veterans who do want to see some action around this .                              
0 0 and they know it has to come from the top and it 's got to be swift .                        
0 0 these are folks who have dealt with a lot of these problems for years and years and years .                      
0 0 but they want to see something , too .                                          
0 0 and i think you 're right .                                              
0 0 i mean these are -- these are real people , real consequences , will focus on military on monday with memorial day .              
0 0 so , the optics of it not great for this white house .                                  
1 0 is there any part of this country that is seen as more politically sacred than wounded veterans , too ?                    
0 0 i think that they are so politically important , they 're important to our civic culture for obvious reasons .                    
0 0 but politically i think they 're very important for this reason .                                    
0 0 there used to be a time in this country when it was part of the mainstream to serve in the military .                
0 0 if you look at congress after world war ii , it was dominated by veterans .                            
0 0 you now have a political class in this country that has not served in the u.s. military .                        
0 0 and i think that is important here because these politicians do n't know what that experience is like and so they 're even more -- they 're even more ginger
0 0 and that 's why you see democrats handling this thing the way they are .                              
0 0 they gave obama a lot of latitude when it came to benghazi , when it came to other scandals .                    
0 0 this is different because of the nature of what we 're talking about .                                
1 0 it 's different and now you have a growing list of democrats especially on high profile races saying well shinseki should go because they 're being asked about this in
0 0 they 'll be asked about it this weekend when they 're standing next to the american legion and next to the vfw guy .            
0 0 charlie crist running for governor of florida ; alison grimes in a marquee senate race in kentucky ; michelle nunn , an important senate race in georgia -- they 're
0 0 democrats in congress , they 're just you know they 're panicking .                                  
1 1 no .                                                        
0 0 the answer to that is absolutely no .                                            
0 0 i spent last week in kentucky covering mitch mcconnell 's race .                                    
0 0 this story penetrates everywhere .                                                  
0 0 the va is such a sprawling bureaucracy .                                            
0 0 it 's not just hospitals .                                                
0 0 it 's outpatient facilities , it 's retirement homes .                                        
0 0 there are families involved .                                                  
0 0 and also it 's not just debts .                                            
0 0 there are many things you know that in health care -- you know , surgeries , whatever , routine health care things .              
0 0 this affects everybody .                                                    
0 0 it penetrates everywhere in this country .                                              
0 0 just do a google news search for va hospitals right now .                                    
0 0 you see stories in miami , in portland , in texas .                                    
0 0 this is everywhere .                                                    
1 0 and it will affect the president in the sense that he 's been trying to recover all year , trying to get his approval rating up .      
0 0 and democrats are desperate for him to get that approval rating up .                                  
0 0 if you look at the polling now he 's at 43 percent .                                  
0 0 in march he was at 43 percent , in january he was at 45 percent .                            
0 0 folks you can look that as a poll graph think if you walked into a hospital room and saw that on your chart .            
0 0 that 's trouble .                                                    
0 0 the democrats see this white house they go to the white house with complaints and they 're told , we 're on top of this , you just do n't
0 0 stop panicking .                                                      
0 0 trust us .                                                      
0 0 you mentioned that senate meeting .                                                
0 0 they called some senators down to explain the president 's foreign policy with the expectation the commander-in-chief would show up .                  
0 0 his chief of staff was there , his national security advisor was there .                                
0 0 bob corcoran who 's is a republican yes he 's a republican he leaves the meeting and he says one of the most bizarre i have attended .    
0 0 what about that sort of parallel universe that you 're all wrong , we 're right ?                          
1 1 yes i mean it goes back to what has been a primary criticism of this white house .                        
0 0 and that is that it is insular .                                            
0 0 you know it 's sort of a truism that people do n't make new friends when they move into the white house .              
0 0 it 's certainly been that way with this -- with this president .                                  
0 0 and you have had periods i think when the president has launch what we call like a -- will go out and talk to republicans and invite them over to
0 1 but this particular incident , you know it did n't work that way .                                
0 0 it only fueled this narrative --                                                
1 1 is it the breaking point -- forgive me for one second , is it the breaking point when the competence question stopped the bush administration , it was katrina ,
0 0 and then in 2006 he tried to come back to social security .                                  
0 0 his own party would n't listen to him .                                          
0 0 he tried to come back to immigration his own party would n't listen to him .                            
0 0 does this president face that problem now that he 's lost the democrats , forget the republicans , he lost them a long time ago .        
1 0 he not only faces that problem on its own he faces an adjacent problem which is hillary clinton .                      
0 0 hillary clinton is who the democrats , who his party is looking toward , lawmakers are looking toward .                      
0 0 they are now looking toward what they see as the future .                                    
0 0 this is absolutely and you saw that in this past week with what happened with the benghazi committee where you had people around hillary clinton who are pushing pelosi privately
0 0 it was as if obama just did n't exist , they were pushing on ahead .                            
0 0 so yes i think he is in very dangerous territory .                                      
1 0 thirty more months , 30 more months of the obama presidency .                                    
0 0 but we 'll watch how this one plays out .                                        
0 0 everybody sit tight .                                                    
0 0 up next , what 's missing ?                                              
0 0 and it 's important when you look closely at the map of 2014 battlegrounds .                              
0 0 but first , in this week 's installment of `` politicians sometimes say the darndest things , '' president obama at the baseball hall of fame updating us on what
1 0 and at the hall 's request i contributed selling on my own which was the jacket i wore when i threw out the first pitch of the 2009 all-star game
0 0 i hear that with the media attention about it , there was also interest in the jeans i wore that night .                
0 0 but michelle retired those jeans quite a while back .                                        
1 0 welcome back .                                                      
0 0 the biggest surprise of this election year so far is that there are no big surprises .                          
0 0 and that 's exactly why the republican establishment is so happy this memorial day weekend .                            
0 0 let 's go to our puzzle i 'll show you what i mean .                                
0 0 remember , if you go back in 2010 when republicans thought they could win a lot of senate seats , well this tea party guy name ken buck surprised them
0 0 in delaware , a chance to win there , a blue state , but christine o'donnell , the tea party candidate wins the nomination , loses in november .  
0 0 that was off the table .                                                
0 0 fast forward to 2012 , it happened in missouri , todd akin beats the establishment candidate , says some things i wo n't repeat , loses in november .  
0 0 see you later , mr. akin .                                              
0 0 and in indiana , richard lugar loses to primary richard murdock , tea party candidate , who then loses to the democrat come november -- a seat the republicans could
0 0 so far this year , i 've got nothing .                                        
0 0 no tea party challengers have knocked off big name incumbents or big name establishment candidates so far .                        
0 0 this past week the establishment wins in kentucky .                                          
0 0 two establishment candidates make a run off in georgia .                                        
0 0 the establishment wins in oregon .                                                
0 0 the week before that we talked about an establishment win in north carolina .                                
0 0 so , so far , no surprises , no tea party challenges .                                  
0 0 so peter hamby , the question is this .                                          
0 0 if the democrats were counting , and they were , on the republicans to lose a few races early on by nominating people from the extreme in these primaries ,
1 1 well look , they -- this is what democrats say who won -- and we 've all heard this all this week that these winning establishment candidates sort of co-opted
0 0 i will say this , though .                                              
0 0 republicans have been patting themselves on the back for putting up these electable candidates .                              
0 0 they certainly are more electable than say paul brown in greene , georgia .                                
0 0 but there are always flawed candidates -- i know it 's the trope of campaigns that candidates matter .                      
0 0 but look at some of these guys .                                            
0 0 i mean like david perdue in georgia , first time candidate ; mitch mcconnell , deeply unpopular ; monica wehby in oregon , you know , some skeletons have surfaced
0 0 tom cotton in arkansas , you know , harvard mckinsey guy , not running a great campaign down in arkansas .                  
0 0 i mean they --                                                    
0 1 i mean look , this applies to democrats , too .                                      
0 0 but just because they had a good week does n't mean that they 're automatically going to coast to victory .                  
1 0 you 're dead right .                                                  
0 0 some candidates do matter on both ends -- the challengers and the incumbents .                                
0 0 but maggie , the republicans look at it this way .                                      
0 0 we have 14 democratic health seats that we 're targeting .                                      
0 0 they have n't given any of them away this early .                                      
0 0 they look at that as , you know , now the democrats are going to have to fight everywhere as opposed to already say well , got that one ,
0 0 take it off .                                                    
1 1 well , that 's accurate .                                                
0 0 you know , democrats are very concerned about what they 're facing .                                  
0 0 and even though there are certain elements about the national mood that seem to be shifting in their obamacare might be a little bit less of a hurdle .  
0 0 we 're not really going to know though honestly on this one .                                  
0 0 i feel like this gets very under looked when there 's the premium shift in the fall .                        
0 0 that 's the next big thing that 's coming on this .                                    
0 0 that 's going to determine a lot of it .                                        
0 0 in the meantime , there is a bit of good news for them , but it is going to be a serious , serious battle .        
0 0 to peter 's point , the candidate quality issue does cut both ways .                                
0 0 it cuts for the incumbents and it cuts for the challengers .                                    
1 0 i think peter raises an important point .                                            
0 0 i think i would just say that if you look at the candidates who are now nominated , they take their advice from the so-called adults of the republican party
0 0 they may make some sort of ill-advised statements at some point on the campaign trail .                            
0 0 but they are going to have ads and a broader strategy that is directed by the high command in washington , d.c. that is going to be very cautious and
0 0 henderson : one of the issues that democrats have , we talk about the high command and republicans listening to the adults in the room -- unclear who the adult
0 0 like what is the broad national strategy or national messaging that democrats can have .                              
0 1 i mean it looks like at some point we 're going to see a real every man and woman for themselves .                
0 1 oh , yes .                                                    
0 0 that 's exactly right , that president obama and harry reid are going to let mark begich be mark begich and that 's a run against obama to the point
1 1 yes , which is what alison grimes is doing .                                        
1 0 you bring up alison grimes .                                                
0 0 let 's show folks her first ad of the general election .                                    
0 0 she comes out of the primary .                                              
0 0 she was expected to win .                                                
0 0 she 's in that marquee race against the republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky .                              
0 0 listen to her here .                                                  
0 0 let 's just say she does n't like anybody in washington .                                    
1 0 it seems no matter how many elections we have , nothing gets better in washington .                            
0 0 it only gets worse .                                                  
0 0 a lot of that is because of the people at the top in both political parties .                          
0 0 and no matter who the president is , i wo n't answer to them .                              
0 0 i 'll only answer to you .                                              
1 0 she 's running against a guy she calls senator gridlock .                                      
0 0 she just said , `` sorry mr. president , if i win , do n't bother calling . ''                      
0 0 she 's also taking a shot there at nancy pelosi and harry reid .                                
1 0 harry reid -- there 's money for her .                                          
1 0 smart , right ?                                                    
1 1 very smart .                                                      
0 0 it 's absolutely the right kind of ad specifically for that state and that race .                            
0 0 but at the moment it really matches where things are .                                      
0 0 the republican brand has a problem for 2016 .                                          
0 0 the democratic brand has a problem right now .                                          
1 0 interesting , you mentioned the other democrats -- i was struck by after we paid a lot of attention to this pennsylvania house primary , marjorie margolies .    
0 0 they cast the vote in congress , 1994 .                                          
0 0 she 's chelsea clinton 's mother-in-law now , the clintons helped her out .                                
0 0 she lost .                                                      
0 0 she lost maybe because she was n't a very good candidate i think .                                
0 0 but the morning after naral , the abortion rights organization criticizes the democrat who won .                            
0 0 he won the election , you 're going into november , could be a swing house district and the democrats are criticizing their nominee .          
0 0 listen to john boehner here who says what conflict with the tea party .                                
1 0 i thought the election went well .                                              
0 0 we 're going to have good candidates on the ballot .                                      
0 0 i 'm not going to enter into this distinction between the tea party and republicans because it 's a distinction you 're going to have a hard time finding .
1 0 now that statement is ludicrous .                                                
0 0 here are a couple of distinctions .                                              
0 0 boehner wants to pass immigration reform ; tea party says no .                                    
0 0 boehner would prefer that the debt ceiling go up without any drama ; tea party says no .                        
0 0 he wanted to strike a grand bargain with the president , maybe include some new revenues in tax reform ; the party says factually that 's crazy .    
0 0 but from a discipline stand point -- again the republicans are like --                                  
1 0 i mean for democrats in some ways , that 's a bit of a gift because they still want the tea party around to kick around in some ways and
0 0 so i mean in that way it 's good but i think --                                  
1 1 do you know what happened in the minutes -- literally the minutes after the campaign was called for mitch mcconnell on tuesday night , everybody endorsed him .    
0 0 all the conservatives issued press releases .                                              
0 0 erick erickson cut him a check , payments and everything , put it online .                              
0 0 they all rallied around him .                                                
0 0 if you talk to republicans , they think there 's this sense in the party that they can smell 51 states .                
0 0 they see the majority and they really want to get it this time around .                              
0 0 that really manifested itself tuesday night .                                              
0 0 there were no sore losers tuesday night .                                            
1 0 if you talk to grassroots conservatives , too like if you go to some district conventions or lincoln day dinners electability is never really something primary voters talk about .
0 0 but you do -- you are starting to hear a little bit organically from grassroots folks that they do want to win .              
0 0 that 's starting to come up a little .                                          
0 0 it might take another cycle but it 's up and coming .                                    
1 0 everybody hang tight .                                                    
0 0 tomorrow 's news today is next as our reporters get you out ahead of the big political stories just around the corner .              
0 0 time now , as we do every sunday , to ask our great reporters to share something from their notebooks so that you can get out ahead of the curve
0 0 nia- malika henderson , you 're first .                                            
0 0 henderson : democrats down in texas , of course , there 's a primary on tuesday , worried about a woman named kesha rogers who is battling for the democratic
0 0 she 's a larouchian .                                                  
0 0 she wants to see obama impeached .                                              
0 0 she 's often seen with posters of obama with a hitler mustache .                                  
0 0 they are worried that she is really disrupting their attempts to really rebrand and rebuild the democratic party in texas .                  
0 0 they do n't think she 'll win , but they 're worried that she might do well in that primary .                  
0 0 that would be a different kind of democrat .                                          
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 we 'll watch that one , too .                                            
0 0 larouchian --                                                        
0 1 long ago i covered the trial in boston but we wo n't digress .                                
0 0 jonathan .                                                        
1 1 staying in the lone star state , there is a runoff this tuesday .                                
0 0 91-year-old ralph hall , longtime congressman from north texas is locked in a run off because he did not get 50 percent of the vote in the march primaries .
0 0 democrats -- i 'm sorry -- republicans in both texas and d.c. that i talked to are worried that he 's not going to win .        
0 0 has played there in the mail -- other conservative groups have played there as well .                            
0 0 because of his advanced age , it 's not a pure ideological victory if the right was to win here , you can be assure given the recent record that
1 0 peter .                                                        
1 1 this is something flying a little bit under the radar in the invisible primary but this friday night , chris christie is going to nashville , tennessee to speak at
0 0 this is important for a couple reasons .                                            
0 1 one , nashville is a huge republican donor hub outside of texas and new york , it 's a big money place because of not just country music , it
0 0 there 's a lot of republican money there .                                          
0 0 but too , this is christie 's first trip to the south since winning re-election , since sort of laying groundwork for a presidential bid .        
0 0 so it will sort of be an interesting place for him to test his message .                            
0 1 i 'm going to be taking a look at that on friday .                                  
1 0 did you ever notice , peter mentions meals a lot .                                      
1 0 hungry .                                                        
1 0 not a bad thing on memorial day weekend .                                          
0 0 the race to watch that is going to be coming on june 3rd is not only what happens in mississippi , it 's going to be what happens in iowa
0 0 who wins there -- it 's a very contested republican primary .                                    
0 0 both sides are going to come out of the gate blasting .                                    
0 0 you 're going to have democrats trying to define who they believe will and some of them hope will be the nominee on the republican side joni ernst .  
0 0 you 're going to have republicans who are well aware that it is going to be difficult for braley , the democrat , to run against a woman .  
0 0 that is a very , very important contest to keep an eye on .                                
1 0 we 'll keep an eye on that one .                                          
0 0 and peter mentioned the contest i want to close with a bit earlier .                                
0 0 pediatric neurosurgeon monica wehby , she won the oregon republican senate primary despite last minute late campaign stories about her allegedly stalking two former boyfriends after breaking up with them
0 1 the man vote say water under the bridge -- happened a long time ago , forget about it , hard feelings are over .            
0 0 but the republicans blame this on democratic smear attacks .                                        
0 0 however , i am told that the national republican senatorial committee decided to send out communication gurus just because they 're a tad worried that the 80s attacks could hurt
0 0 so some communications help sent out to oregon .                                          
0 0 she 's running against the democratic incumbent jeff merkley .                                        
0 0 that 's it for inside politics , thanks again for sharing your sunday morning , especially on this very special weekend when we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice
0 0 we 'll see you soon .

    good morning .                                                      
    the day after the nomination : president bush and his supreme court pick hit the ground running .                        
    are they facing a fight or a cakewalk ?                                          
1 0 i urge the senate to rise to the occasion to provide a fair and civil process .                          
1 0 the campaign to define the nominee is under way with a degree of caution by democrats .                          
1 0 the real issue in these hearings is going to be on who -- judge roberts is on who 's side .                  
1 0 i believe that judge roberts is exactly the kind of justice america expects on the supreme court .                        
1 0 the un-bork : we 'll count the way john roberts is different from the famously failed nominee of the reagan era .                
1 0 we 'll examine robert 's past rulings featuring fast foods and reptiles .                                  
0 0 now live from washington , cnn 's inside politics .                                        
1 0 well thanks for joining us .                                                
0 0 i 'm suzanne malveaux .                                                  
0 0 and there has n't been this much choreography on network television since the finale of `` dancing with the stars . ''                
0 1 in the last 24 hours judge john roberts ' introduction to america has been playing out how the white house wanted it .              
0 0 the supreme court nominee 's debut is continuing this hour on capitol hill with key senators of both parties sending signals that roberts ' confirmation prospects are good .  
0 0 we begin with our congressional correspondent , joe johns -- joe ?                                    
1 0 suzanne , that certainly does seem to be the case .                                      
0 0 judge roberts on capitol hill today making the rounds , talking to democrats and republicans ; expected in a little bit to talk to senator patrick leahy of vermont ,
0 0 this is a period when a nominee for the court essentially is defined on capitol hill and in the media .                  
0 0 he is being called a brilliant choice , even by some democrats off the hill who say he is to the right , but not so far to the right
0 0 just a little while ago , i asked senator ben nelson , who was the leader -- the democratic leader of the so-called gang of 14 that essentially came up
1 0 well , i 'm certainly not thinking about it right now and i do n't -- i 'm not hearing anybody .                
0 0 sometimes there 's hallway whisper .                                                
0 0 none of that to date .                                                
0 0 it 's still new , but i 'm not hearing it and i think by this point in time , that could very well be the case .    
1 0 republicans , obviously being much more openly complimentary of this nomination , talking about his service at hogan and hartson , the law firm here in town ; his service
0 0 circuit court of appeals .                                                  
0 0 senator john mccain on the floor , also talking about the possibility of a filibuster which he just does n't see happening .              
1 0 i am a member -- a card-carrying member of the gang of 14 and one of the criteria of the gang of 14 is that we would not filibuster a
0 0 i do not speak for the 14 members .                                          
0 0 i only speak for myself , but having been in on those negotiations about extraordinary circumstances for hundreds of hours , i think that judge roberts deserves an up-or- down
1 0 still , there is reason to expect some hard questions for judge roberts , particularly among people who are concerned about the issue of abortion on the democratic side .
0 0 senator barbara boxer of california , saying she just does n't know enough about him right now to say whether she thinks he 'll be good on her view of
1 0 i do n't know enough , but you know , whether someone is flamboyant about their views and votes to the far right and someone else is not flamboyant ,
1 0 and it is not quite the end of the day here on capitol hill .                              
0 0 roberts still talking to people including senate democratic leader harry reid just a little while ago .                          
0 0 he 's got a lot more talking to do here on capitol hill .                                
0 0 obviously , down the road we have the issue of questions submitted to him .                              
0 0 we have the issue of a confirmation hearing .                                          
0 0 of course , he 's had a confirmation hearing here on capitol hill just within the last two or three years .                
0 0 he was able to get through and go down to the d.c .                                  
0 0 circuit court of appeals .                                                  
0 0 a lot of democrats , however , saying right now the standard is completely different , than it was for him to go to the circuit court .    
0 0 back to you , suzanne .                                                
1 0 not even close to the end of the day .                                        
0 0 thank you so much , joe johns .                                            
0 0 and now on to the white house where the president and judge roberts began their day with coffee and more of their full court press for his confirmation .  
0 0 let 's bring in our white house correspondent dana bash -- dana ?                                  
1 1 hi , suzanne .                                                    
1 0 making the rounds up there , but also starting the day here at the white house this morning .                      
1 0 driving himself and in his own car .                                            
0 0 coming here for a not-so-average kind of meeting and that is of course , having coffee with the president of the united states , the morning after he decided that
0 0 now , the next part of this well-choreographed day .                                        
0 0 you see the two men there stepping into the rose garden and at that time , president bush took the opportunity to make another plea to democrats on capitol hill
1 0 in my conversations with senators last night , we discussed how important it is that judge roberts get a fair hearing , a timely hearing and a hearing that will
1 1 now , there were also some key republican senators here at the white house today , meeting with roberts , meeting with some of the strategists here at the white
0 0 and essentially , what they feel here at the white house is that they might have really threaded the political needle .                
0 0 they understand that they needed to find somebody who is a known quantity among conservatives and they feel like they have done that despite the irony , perhaps , of
1 0 because he is somebody who worked in a republican administration , somebody who is known , again , inside washington by conservatives , but also , even probably more importantly
1 0 jack keeney .                                                      
1 0 he 's a conservative politically , but he is an incredible legal intellect .                                
0 0 so , i do n't see him as joining justice scalia in a particular opinion or justice thomas in a particular opinion .              
0 0 what i actually see is judge roberts becoming justice roberts and getting people to join his opinions , because his analysis , i think , will be pretty straightforward and

0 0 in demonstrations today , womens groups and others urged senators to ask tough questions about roberts ' past statements about abortion .                
0 0 in 1990 , when he was deputy solicitor general for the first president bush , roberts co-authored a brief saying , `` we continue to believe that roe was wrongly
0 0 roberts was asked to explain his position during his 2003 confirmation hearings to become an appeals court judge .                      
0 0 he explained the 1990 brief by saying he was acting as an advocate for his client .                          
0 0 roberts went on to say that , `` roe v. wade is the settled law of the land , '' and he said there is nothing in his personal views
1 0 there 's no role for advocacy with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge .                    
0 0 the judge is bound to follow the supreme court precedent whether he agrees with it or disagrees with it and bound to apply the rule of law in cases whether
0 0 personal views , personal ideology -- those have no role to play whatever .                                
1 0 and during that confirmation hearing , roberts said it would not be appropriate for him to comment on rove vs. wade as an example of judicial activism .

0 0 thank you very much , senator , for joining us .                                      
1 0 happy to be with you .                                                
0 0 it 's a busy day here on the hill .                                        
1 1 absolutely .                                                        
0 0 busy day for everybody , i 'm sure .                                          
0 0 now , let 's start with the first issue here .                                      
0 0 democrats had asked for consultation and immediately the white house bombarded democrats with calls .                              
0 0 yesterday , president bush could say , with roberts by his side , that he had reached out to the party .                
0 0 he had listened and here was his pick , a solidly conservative nominee .                                
0 0 was this a serious consultation ?                                                
0 0 or do you think you were played ?                                            
1 1 well , i think a number of our thoughts were heard .                                    
0 0 it was not as thorough a consultation as i would have liked .                                  
0 0 we suggested names to him , not the other way around .                                    
0 0 it was somewhat different than the consultation we had with the reagan administration or the clinton administration , which was far more thorough .            
0 0 but with this administration it was far more extensive than we normally would have .                              
0 0 i had a number of -- several good talks with the president , including last night , when he called me on judge roberts .          
0 0 he obviously has to make the final decision .                                          
0 0 i know some of the names that had been considered by the white house would have created enormous problems .                    
0 0 but i think now we have a nominee .                                          
0 0 we 'll sit down , we 'll do our due diligence .                                    
0 0 i expect to spend a lot of the month of august in my home in vermont reading all of judge roberts ' opinions and writings , as well as the
1 0 now , senator , there was so much discussion , and even speculation if you will , that there were other candidates more palatable to the democrats that he might
0 0 why do you suppose that the president did not go that way ?                                  
0 0 were the democrats not effective , not convincing in their case for the need for a consensus candidate ?                      
1 1 well , i do n't think -- you know , the president at no time said , `` ok , come in and make a case for this person or
0 0 i have had -- past presidents have .                                            
0 0 this president did not .                                                  
0 0 so it 's not a case of him rejecting somebody we brought in .                                
0 0 but we rather purposely did not give a whole list of names saying these are all great candidates , because with some at the white house , of course ,
0 0 but the president heard the things that we suggested .                                        
0 0 i said to him , as i 've said oftentimes publicly , `` give us a nominee who can unite us and not divide us . ''      
0 0 and we 'll find out after we have had the hearings whether that is the case .                          
1 0 well , senator , what is the most important issue for his record that you need to know to confirm him ?                
0 0 obviously roe v. wade , abortion rights is going to play very high in the hearings .                          
1 0 that goes into the whole issue of settled law .                                        
0 0 i mean , that 's everything from brown v. board of education , roe v. wade , miranda , a whole lot of different areas .        
0 0 and we 'd like to know what his role is going to be in that .                            
0 0 you know , we have right now the most activist supreme court in my lifetime .                            
0 0 this is a supreme court that has overturned more legislation written by congress , everything from the violence against women 's act to environmental areas .        
1 0 but specifically on abortion rights , what do you need to hear from him ?                              
1 0 let me finish , because this is part of it .                                      
0 0 and they 've replaced it by really creating laws of their own .                                  
0 0 it is the most activist .                                                
0 0 so i 'm going to ask him , are you going to be part of that same activist coalition overturning settled law , rewriting the law yourself ?    
0 0 and among those , of course , is going to be roe v. wade .                              
1 0 now , of course , when you asked justice clarence thomas about that case during his confirmation hearings , he responded that he never discussed roe v. wade .  
0 0 is that the kind of answer that is going to be acceptable to you this time around , or what do you need to hear from him ?    
1 0 well , that was n't acceptable from justice thomas .                                        
0 0 i do n't think anybody believed him .                                            
0 0 roe v. wade came down while he was in law school .                                    
0 0 i know having been a law student myself , any case that comes down from the supreme court you discuss and discuss at length , especially a milestone case like
0 0 so i do n't think anybody believed clarence thomas ' answer when he stated under oath he had never discussed roe v. wade .            
1 0 senator patrick leahy , thank you very much for joining us .                                    
0 0 sorry we 're out of time .                                              
0 0 take care .                                                      
1 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 next , sandra day o'connor reacts to word of her potential replacement .                                  
0 0 up next , we 'll hear what the retiring justice has to say about the man who would take her place on the high court .        
1 0 the justice who john roberts would replace in the high court was far from the nation 's capital when her proposed successor was announced .          
0 0 sandra day o'connor spent the day fly fishing in idaho along with her husband and the outdoors editor of the `` spokane spokesman review '' newspaper .      
0 0 when she learned that roberts was the president 's choice , o'connor is quoted as saying , '' that 's fabulous . ''              
0 0 she described roberts as a `` brilliant legal mind , a straight shooter , articulate and he should not have trouble being confirmed by october . ''      
0 0 then she went on to say quote , `` he 's good in every way except he 's not a woman . ''              
0 0 with me now from the white house for more on the roberts nomination is nicolle devenish , a very capable woman , she is the president 's communication director .
0 0 obviously , nicolle , you have had a very , very busy day .                                
0 0 the president as well as judge roberts , a very good day from all accounts .                            
0 0 now , let 's start off with the process here .                                      
0 0 democrats initially had asked for consultation .                                              
0 0 the white house immediately set up this operation with phone calls , meetings , really an all out campaign .                    
0 0 and many of those democrats had expressed their desire to put a minority or a woman in that position .                    
0 0 instead the president elected a white male conservative .                                          
0 0 was that just for show ?                                                
1 0 well i think if the president has a record of , going as far back as his time as governor of texas , of appointing unprecedented numbers of women and
0 0 it contained women and minorities .                                                
0 0 and the president , no matter who had -- whose seat he was filling he would have insisted that he be able to choose from a list of candidates that
0 0 now let me also say that those consultations resulted in names that the democrats and republicans suggested , and a name that was suggested to this white house was judge
0 0 so i do n't think there 's any basis for saying that any of those consultations were for show and obviously the democrats that raised his name know who they
0 0 and it 's a private process that we 'll keep private , but it 's very important that people understand that those consultations were take very seriously .    
0 0 they consumed a great amount of time from the president down through his senior staff and doj staff , as well .                
0 0 and their feedback was taken very seriously .                                            
0 0 and i think it 's reflected in the president 's selection of a very fair , a very qualified nominee in judge roberts , and someone who has earned high
1 0 but some of your critics even say that all this talk of considering a woman or a hispanic like gonzalez , was simply meant to soften the blow for the
1 0 well , you know , again , we do n't take responsibility for people that were putting out inaccurate information yesterday .                
0 0 it 's unfortunate when people go out on a limb and speculate about a choice we worked very hard to very keep private .            
0 0 in deference and out of our respect for every candidate that we consider , but the president 's focus from the very beginning of really , his time in office
0 0 it 's a decision that he views as one of the most consequential decisions that any president makes .                      
0 0 it 's a nomination that president reagan called an awesome appointment .                                    
0 0 and it is one that he made with a singular focus on the most qualified jurist out there .                      
0 0 and you know i think there have been some extraordinary moments .                                    
0 0 i think that we saw from judge roberts the deep reverence he has for the court .                          
0 0 he talked about the lump in his throat that he feels when he walks up the marble steps .                      
0 0 and i think this is an extraordinary moment .                                          
0 0 it 's been 11 years since we have seen an individual nominated to the supreme court , and judge roberts is worthy of that nomination .        
1 0 nicolle ?                                                        
0 1 so sorry to cut you off .                                              
0 0 i 'm sorry , we 're going to have to leave it there .                                
0 0 thanks so much .                                                    
0 0 appreciate it .                                                      
0 0 when president bush and judge roberts appeared on national television last night , there was a sideshow going on that viewers missed .              
0 0 roberts wife jane marie stood off camera with their children .                                      
0 0 four-year-old jack and 5-year-old josephine .                                                
0 0 but as kids do , they got a little bit restless .                                    
0 0 when the networks later took a cut away shots of mrs. roberts , the children were out of the picture .                  
0 0 it called to mind the unpredictability , when little ones are thrust into the political arena .                          
0 0 john edwards ' kids were showcased in the 2004 presidential campaign , usually to the democrats advantage .                        
0 0 and many political junkies still remember rudy giuliani 's first inauguration as mayor with fondness and amusement , because of his then young son andrew 's tactics .    
0 0 based on the initial reaction to judge roberts nomination , you could say he is no robert bork .                      
0 0 still ahead , the tale of two nominees .                                          
0 0 one who might make it through and one who did n't .                                    
0 0 plus , the partisan interest groups have their guns out and the ads are flying .                            
0 0 we 'll ask dueling advocates if their battle is full fledged to likely to fizzle .

1 0 thanks , christine .

0 0 breaking news here .                                                    
0 0 cnn has confirmed this -- and this just coming off the wires , as well -- we understand that georgian police have detained a person late wednesday suspected of throwing
0 0 as you may recall , this was actually back in may , this from the interior ministry , as well as cnn confirming those facts .        
0 0 we understand that the capture followed a shootout in a village outside of the capital , tbilisi , in georgia , in which one policeman was killed , another wounded
0 0 we are seeing images taken from a.p .                                            
0 0 and tv grabs of that -- perhaps of that suspect there .

0 0 as soon as we have more information , we 'll get that to you , as well .                        
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 instead of harsh words , the rollout of president bush 's supreme court nominee has been highlighted by smiling faces and a lot of democrats keeping their powder dry .
0 0 it 's a far cry from what could have been and what had been two decades ago .                        
0 0 our senior political analyst bill schneider considers why john roberts is no robert bork .                              
1 0 here 's how one expert sizes up the stakes in the supreme court battle .                              
1 0 we really have n't seen a swing vote of this magnitude retire since lewis powell in 1987 .                        
0 1 and you remember what happened then .                                              
1 0 then came a huge fight over robert bork 's nomination .                                      
0 0 bork lost .                                                      
0 0 john roberts is supposed to be the un-bork .                                          
1 0 john roberts is a very difficult target for the democrats to get much traction against .                            
1 0 bork came across as a radical conservative .                                            
1 0 in robert bork 's america , there is no room at the inn for blacks and no place in the constitution for women .            
0 0 and in our america , there should be no seat on the supreme court for robert bork .                        
1 0 roberts is being labeled an establishment conservative .                                            
1 0 i always got a lump in my throat whenever i walked up to those marble steps to argue a case before the court .            
1 0 what kind of court do americans want , more conservative or more liberal ?                                
0 0 more conservative beats more liberal , 41 to 30 percent .                                      
0 0 but 25 percent of the country want to keep the court just as it is now .                          
0 0 add them in , and you get 66 percent who do n't want a more liberal court and 55 percent who do n't want a more conservative court .  
0 0 a slightly more conservative court looks ok ; a radically more conservative court , no .                            
0 0 roberts ' supporters say no bork he .                                            
1 0 he is a mainstream conservative .                                                
1 0 his critics , like moveon.org , say instead of a mainstream jurist , bush chose another right-wing crony .                      
0 0 in other words , he borked .                                              
0 0 bork or un-bork ?                                                    
0 0 here 's what senator kennedy says .                                              
1 1 what all americans deserve to know is whether judge roberts respects the core values of the constitution and falls within the conservative mainstream of america , along the lines of
0 0 that is the issue .                                                  
1 0 in other words , we 'll see .                                            
0 0 in 2000 , roberts made these comments to the `` baltimore sun '' about the rehnquist court .                        
0 0 quote , `` the conventional wisdom is that this is a conservative court .                                
0 0 we have to take that more skeptically . ''                                          
0 0 roberts went on , quote , `` of the three issues the public was most interested in , school prayer , abortion , and miranda rights , the conservatives lost
0 0 sounds like someone who would like to see the court move to the right .                              
1 0 bill schneider , thank you very much .                                            
0 0 now , earlier in the program , we heard from democratic senator patrick leahy .                              
0 0 a short time ago , i spoke with republican senator sam brownback , who is also a member of the judiciary committee .              
0 0 i started by asking brownback that , given roberts ' limited paper trail as a judge , is there a risk for conservatives that he might be more moderate than
1 1 well , that 's an area of concern .                                          
0 0 and i wish we had somebody in that setting , in that sense , that we knew more about their view of the constitution and its meaning and the court
0 0 we do n't have that .                                                
0 0 we clearly have a brilliant jurist .                                              
0 0 this gentleman is brilliant .                                                  
0 0 he 's a great lawyer .                                                
0 0 he 's argued a number of cases in front of the supreme court , harvard law school , harvard undergraduate , brilliant gentleman .            
0 0 what i hope we can find out during the hearing process is his view of the constitution .                        
0 0 is it a living document that changes , or is it a set document by its text ?                        
0 0 that 's what i 'm interested in .                                            
1 0 and how do you get to those answers ?                                          
1 1 well , i think you really ask the question basically that way .                                  
0 0 you do n't ask people about roe versus wade .                                        
0 0 you do n't ask people about property rights cases that might come in front of them .                          
0 0 but you ask them , `` what is your view of the constitution and the role of the courts in enforcing this constitution ? ''          
0 0 and you really try to get their view of how they see that constitutional document .                            
1 0 now , let 's talk about roe v. wade , because you recently chaired the first of several senate hearings evaluating the ramification of that .        
0 0 in a recent cnn- '' usa today '' -gallup poll showing 68 percent of americans say that the supreme court should not overturn roe v. wade .      
0 0 how much do you think abortion is going to play into these hearings ?                                
1 0 it will play into it , because it 's the lead social issue of our day from both sides .                    
0 0 but i think one ought to back up on it and say , `` instead of looking at abortion , let 's look at the constitution .      
0 0 what 's in the constitution ? ''                                              
0 0 and let 's look and examine that for the topic , because that 's really the issue here , and the role of the courts in the country today ,
0 0 and that would be inappropriate for us to ask .                                        
1 0 now , obviously , this is going to be a battle .                                    
0 0 because we have already heard from senator reid .                                          
0 0 he said , `` clearly , a judicial nominee should not comment on pending cases .                            
0 0 but there are many other questions that a nominee should answer . ''                                  
0 0 and he goes on to say , `` i encourage judge roberts to be forthcoming in responding to the committee 's questions , providing written materials requested by the senators
0 0 do you think that roberts should be expected to answer at least some of those sensitive questions on issues like abortion during these hearings ?          
1 0 well , did ruth bader ginsburg answer those questions ?                                        
0 0 i 've looked early at the transcript and she did not .                                    
0 0 she replaced byron white , who was a dissenter on roe , and here was ruth bader ginsburg who was , at the time , a lawyer for the aclu
0 0 she did n't respond to those questions .                                            
0 0 you can ask all those questions .                                              
0 0 it 's fine to do that .                                              
0 0 but if people look at the past and they project into the future , nominees have never answered that specific prejudging a hypothetical question .          
0 0 they 're not going to do that .                                            
0 0 they have n't in the past ; they should n't now .                                    
1 0 now , of course , many people have been talking about the possibility of a filibuster here .                        
0 0 many members of your party said they do n't believe the filibuster will be used .                            
0 0 but we heard from senator schumer who said that he would not rule it out , necessarily .                        
0 0 is this a concern for republicans that could be a option ?                                    
1 0 it 's very much a concern that it 's an option , because that then raises the bar from 51 votes to 60 votes to approve a nominee , which
0 0 the bar should be 51 votes , a majority of the people in the united states senate .                        
0 0 and i think a filibuster would be just simply wrong .                                      
0 0 this is not an extraordinary circumstance .                                              
0 0 this is a highly qualified nominee .                                              
0 0 you may disagree with him .                                                
0 0 you may agree with him .                                                
0 0 but it should be a vote , and it should be a majority vote .                              
1 0 now , the battle that may or may not lie ahead in the senate will depend to a large degree on judge roberts ' past writings and rulings .  
0 0 as our bruce morton explains , roberts ' paper trail may be thin , but it has several main points of interest .              
1 0 where does he stand on the issues ?                                            
0 0 let 's start with abortion .                                                
0 1 as deputy solicitor general , he co-authored a brief which said , quote , `` we continue to believe that roe , '' the decision legalizing abortion , `` was
0 0 the court 's conclusion that there is a fundamental right to an abortion finds no support in the text , structure or history of the constitution , '' unquote .
0 0 but at his confirmation hearing for the court of appeals in 2003 , he said he 'd been arguing the government 's point of view , adding , quote ,
0 0 there 's nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent , '' unquote .                
0 0 in a case involving the arroyo toad , he wrote that the , quote , `` hapless toad , for reasons of its own , lives its entire life in
0 0 then there was the 12-year-old girl arrested , searched and handcuffed by police in washington , d.c. , subway system for eating one french fry .        
0 0 quote , `` the district court subscribed the policies that led to her arrest as foolish , '' unquote .                    
0 0 he wrote , `` and , indeed , the policies were changed after those responsible endured the sort of publicity reserved for adults who make young girls cry .  
0 0 the question , however , is not whether these policies were a bad idea but whether they violated the fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution .      
0 0 we conclude that they did not , '' unquote .                                        
0 0 he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled unanimously that military tribunals set up to try terrorism suspects were legal and that the geneva convention did not apply to
0 0 and lastly , he said this during his confirmation hearing for the court of appeals .                            
1 0 there 's no role for advocacy , with respect to personal beliefs or views on the part of a judge .                  
0 0 the judge is bound to follow the supreme court precedent , whether he agrees with it or disagrees with it , and bound to apply the rule of law in
0 0 personal views , personal ideology -- those have no role to play whatever .                                
1 0 as for gay rights , no paper trail that we know of .                                  
0 0 but this is just the start .                                              
0 0 there will be many questions .                                                
0 0 bruce morton , cnn , washington .                                              
1 1 and members of the senate may not be rushing to judgment about roberts , but some interest groups are .                    
0 0 up next , we 'll hear from both sides in the unfolding fight for and against roberts ' nomination .                    
0 0 also ahead , supreme showdown or supreme letdown ?                                          
0 0 the prospects for a peaceful d.c. summer in our `` strategy session . ''                                
0 0 and in an instant , john roberts became a big man in the blogosphere .                              
0 0 we 'll plug into the confirmation debate online .                                          
0 0 political interest groups , both in favor and against the john roberts ' nomination , have already sprung into action .                  
0 0 abortion rights protestors marched today in front of the supreme court .                                    
0 0 the national organization for women and naral pro-choice america were quick to announce their opposition to the roberts nomination .                    
0 0 the left-leaning people for the american way is also raising concerns .                                    
0 0 the group 's president says , quote , `` replacing o'connor with someone who is not committed to upholding americans ' rights , liberties , and legal protections would be
0 0 the organized effort to support john roberts is also up and running .                                  
0 0 the group progress for america plans to spend a million dollars over the next week airing this tv ad on cable news outlets nationwide .          
1 0 colleagues call him brilliant and praise his integrity and fair-mindedness .                                      
0 0 now president bush has nominated roberts for the supreme court .                                      
0 0 should n't a fair judge be treated fairly ?                                          
0 0 urge the senate to give john roberts a fair up-or-down vote .                                    
1 0 now , with me now , representatives from two of the groups we just heard from .                          
0 0 ralph neas is the president of the people for the american way and ben ginsberg is legal adviser to progress for america .              
0 0 already , in the commercial break , there was a little mud- slinging .                                
0 0 i 'm not going to allow too much of that here .                                    
0 0 but obviously , this is a very , very big battle ahead for everyone involved .                            
0 0 ben , i will start with you .                                            
0 0 you 've worked with roberts .                                                
0 0 what do you know about him that perhaps we have not read in the papers this morning , that we 've seen on his exposes in the last 12 hours
1 0 well , he 's the perfect choice for this job .                                      
0 0 and in a way , he 's the left 's worse nightmare .                                  
0 0 he has a distinguished career .                                                
0 0 he 's practiced before the supreme court , argued 39 times before them .                                
0 0 he really is the best and brightest of his generation .                                      
0 0 he has a mainstream philosophy and mainstream writings .                                          
0 0 and the truth of the matter is he is precisely the type of person who should be serving on the supreme court .              
1 0 all right , ralph , i take it that you disagree here .                                  
0 0 but i want to talk about the reaction here from the democrats , from the senators .                          
0 0 some say really it was kind of almost molasses slow .                                      
0 0 did you not have that declarative statement of , `` this is somebody that we can not accept here .                    
0 0 we do n't see anything particularly in his record that we are going to basically bark about at this time . ''                
0 0 is this a democratic strategy here ?                                              
0 0 `` let 's wait and see , let 's dig up , see what we can get , '' or is just the fact is that you just do n't
1 0 people for the american way has not yet taken a position on the roberts nomination .                            
0 0 we 've asked the senators , republicans and democrats , to withhold judgment , not to take a position until after the senate judiciary committee hearings .      
0 0 and the more we learn about john roberts , his likeability is apparent .                                
0 0 he 's got fine legal skills .                                              
0 0 it 's his judicial philosophy that we want to find out about .                                  
0 0 the more we learn , i 'm afraid he could be an antonin scalia in sheep 's clothing .                      
0 0 and we 're afraid that , rather than being like a mainstream conservative like sandra o'connor , he could have the judicial philosophy of clarence thomas and antonin scalia .
0 0 and if they get one or two more like-minded colleagues , more than 100 supreme court precedents would be overturned going back to 1937 , affecting equal opportunity , affecting
0 0 so we have got to find out , what is his judicial philosophy ?                                
0 1 the burden is on him to prove to the american people and to the united states senate that he 's a mainstream conservative .            
0 0 and i hope that he 'll produce evidence to that .                                      
0 0 and of course , there 's a loss of a paper trail .                                  
0 0 just like justice rehnquist , he should be able to give up his documents from his tenure at the white house and at the department of justice .    
1 0 ben , is he another scalia here ?                                            
0 0 because , obviously , when it seems to me as if he is not really even inspiring those on the ultra-right side here , that you do n't have that
0 0 and a lot of people were thinking that that was what was going to happen here .                          
0 0 there seems almost to be a certain consensus that 's developing .                                    
0 1 at least we 're seeing it on the hill .                                        
1 1 yes , i think that 's absolutely true .                                          
0 0 and do n't forget , just 20 months ago , john roberts was confirmed unanimously by the senate to the court of appeals , where they had a chance to
0 0 and that was a unanimous vote .                                              
0 0 now , unfortunately , where i think ralph is suggesting this process go is a series of litmus tests about a nominee .              
0 0 and that 's unfortunate , because ...                                              
1 1 is that what you 're taking about ?                                            
1 1 no , not at all .                                                
0 1 not at all .                                                    
1 0 well , it can lead to a bunch of whole issues .                                    
0 0 and that was kind of you 're either with us or not ...                                  
1 1 that does n't sound like a litmus test to me , ben .                                  
0 0 it sounds like a judicial philosophy .                                              
1 1 well , i think , ralph , that 's not the case , because , on the judicial philosophy , you now have the members of the senate agreeing that
0 0 i do n't think you can go there with john roberts .                                    
0 1 and that 's why you 're hearing ...                                            
1 0 are there extraordinary circumstances in this case for a filibuster ?                                      
1 0 very importantly , robert bork was unanimously approved for the circuit court of appeals , just like john roberts , and then was defeated 58-42 when he was up for
0 0 with respect to extraordinary circumstances , only the 14 senators who signed that memorandum of understanding on may 23rd know what that means .            
0 0 we do know that 20 percent , more than 20 percent , of all supreme court nominees have been rejected , 60 percent of them without even a vote .
0 0 there have been three filibusters against supreme court justices since 1968 , the successful one against abe fortas , where he had 51 votes supporting him , and two unsuccessful
0 0 that 's the history of the senate .                                            
0 0 so that , i would assume , would constitute the circumstances that the senators are talking about .                        
0 0 but only they know for sure .                                              
0 0 it 's really premature to start talking about a filibuster .                                      
0 0 let 's have the senate judiciary hearings .                                            
0 0 they 're always the most crucial part of the confirmation process .                                    
0 0 with all due respect to ben and myself , it 's important to have this national dialogue and national debate to tell people what 's at stake .    
1 0 there 's been a lot of talk about his record .                                      
0 0 but of course , one thing is , he 's an establishment candidate .                                
0 0 and that can be taken in a good way .                                        
0 0 he is well-liked in washington by democrats and republicans .                                        
0 0 and so obviously , that is going to be a point , as well .                              
0 0 i have to thank you both .                                              
0 0 we 're running out of time .                                              
1 1 great to be here .

0 0 the sheer volume of information posted about john roberts in such a short period of time is absolutely astounding .                    
0 0 we have that sentiment over at myopiczeal.blogsome.com .

0 0 he went to bed early last night , posted at 7 o'clock this morning , noting that the amount of commentary already written by that time was incredible .  
1 0 there were many roundups out there on the conservative side .                                      
0 0 what is the right saying ?                                                
0 0 it 's by-and-large very , very positive today .                                          
0 0 blogsforbush.com has a great long list of conservative bloggers weighing in .                                    
0 0 volokh.com , d.c. law professor calling this decision `` inspired . ''                                    
0 0 iowavoice.com , for example , `` i do n't think the president could have made a better choice . ''                    
0 0 when conservative columnist ann coulter earlier on today said that maybe this was n't the best pick for a nominee -- she said , `` a souter in roberts '
0 0 you 're seeing on the right a kind of collective sigh of relief .                                
0 0 there 's been a lot of concern with the conservative bloggers that bush 's pick would be a moderate .                    
0 0 a lot of worry about alberto gonzales .                                            
0 0 and today , it seems like a pleasant surprise , and that 's summed up nicely at right wing news .                  
0 0 what they say is , `` i feel like a little kid who got a puppy , a b.b .                    
0 0 gun , and a bike for christmas when he was just expecting another sweater . ''                            
1 0 but what if it was a really nice sweater ?                                        
0 0 i would have taken the sweater .                                              
0 0 something on the left that we 're starting to see , this meme developing of a partisan hack .                      
0 0 mydd.com -- this is a progressive blog -- chris bowers posting , `` one partisan hack for another , '' and essentially saying that the bush administration was picked by
0 0 but not all on the left saying that .                                          
0 0 a lot of people saying , `` hold on .                                        
0 0 slow down .                                                      
0 0 we do n't really know that much about him just yet . ''                                  
0 0 jeralyn merritt at talkleft.com is one of those people , saying she `` does n't know much about roberts .                    
0 0 it 's not good to come out swinging this early on .                                    
0 0 it 's going to make it seem like they would have countered anyone president bush up .                          
0 0 wait and see what we know , then we 'll post more about it .

1 0 and that 's the sentiment that 's echoed over the popular blog dailykos.com , the most heavily trafficked blog on the left out there , where kos himself was weighing
0 0 we do n't know enough right now .                                            
0 0 we 're willing to hear roberts out on this one , '' saying that , `` for all we know , and for all the religious right knows at this
1 0 and one thing we 'd be remiss that we did n't mention that is coming up right now is how attractive john roberts is .          
0 0 over at the moderate voice , greg piper posting , `` john roberts , judicial heartthrob , '' pointing out , `` what says america more than the name 'john
0 0 for god 's sake , he could have been a pilgrim . ''

0 0 not an official poll , but one that they took very seriously -- suzanne ?

1 0 the process that the president says he hopes will happen quickly .                                    
0 0 speaking in baltimore today , the president gave strong support for the man he believes is a good choice .                    
0 0 he 's somebody americans will be proud to have seated on that bench .                                
0 0 he has the qualities that our country expects in a judge : experience , wisdom , fairness and civility .                    
0 0 he has profound respect for the rule of law .                                        
0 0 he has respect for the liberties guaranteed to every single citizen .                                    
1 0 he will strictly apply the constitution and laws .                                          
0 0 he will not legislate from the bench .                                            
0 0 now sandra day o'connor today said , you know , a great choice .                                
1 1 the only thing was wrong was he was n't a man .                                    
0 0 are you ladies -- are you disappointed by that ?                                        
1 0 i was .                                                      
1 1 i 'll tell you , she said in this statement , i guess she was out fishing in spokane , washington .                
0 0 not catching any fish .                                                  
0 0 well , not catching any .                                                
0 0 but she said the president said he would cast a wide net clearly came up short when it came to the selection in terms of the gender .    
0 0 you know , she said that the court now is reduced by -- the number of women on the court reduced by 50 percent .          
0 0 and she said that she was disappointed , although she said that he was a good candidate .                        
0 0 look , i was disappointed .                                                
0 0 i thought the president would , in fact , select a woman , a minority .                            
0 0 after all , we 've had 109 justices .                                          
0 0 only four have been nonwhite males .                                              
0 0 it would have been a great selection .                                            
1 1 we knew that the president would select a conservative .                                        
0 0 and the only thing that would distinguish between him and the other jurists is that he 's a younger conservative in my judgment .            
0 0 tory , let me -- just kind of scenario here , because some people say look , if you were looking at a company , a ceo was essentially going
0 0 and that 's who we 're going with .                                          
0 0 people would cry foul .                                                  
0 0 they 'd say , wait a minute , this is an old boy establishment .                              
0 0 the network promoting this kind of thing .                                            
1 1 why should n't people see it that way ?                                          
0 0 or should they ?                                                    
0 0 well , i think some people are disappointed .                                          
0 0 i think some people look at it that cynically .                                        
0 0 i wonder if the president himself told mrs. bush he was not picking a woman , or did he get a staffer to do that .        
0 0 but i think , people may be disappointed it 's not a woman or a minority , but they ca n't be disappointed in the process .      
1 0 he did look at a white range of people , all sizes and shapes and colors and genders , and came up with the choice that he thinks is the
0 0 i think it 's also likely he 's got another pick before his administration is over , president bush does , and it puts more pressure and more interest on
0 0 let 's talk about the hot issue , of course , which is abortion .                              
0 0 i want to actually show the viewers a couple of things , a statement that he made back in 1990 .                  
0 0 `` he says we continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled . ''                        
0 0 and then , of course , in his confirmation hearing in april of 2003 , he makes the statement that roe v wade is the settled law of the land
0 0 we 've learned a lot more about him in the last 12 hours .                                
0 0 we know he 's roman catholic .                                              
0 0 we know that his wife is a part of a group , a pro-life organization here .                          
1 0 what does that say about the candidate ?                                            
0 0 how important is that going to be in this confirmation ?                                      
0 0 i think it 's going to be one of many issues that gets scrutinized when members of the senate judiciary committee sit and talk to him about his views .
0 0 i mean , will he come before the judiciary committee with his previous views on abortion , that abortion rights should be overturned ?            
0 0 or will he come with his current views that it 's settled law ?                                
1 0 we should find out during the confirmation process .                                          
0 0 malveaux : tori , what does he have to say to satisfy the conservatives ?                              
0 0 oh , i think this will be the no .                                        
0 0 1 issue .                                                      
0 0 and i think what 's fascinating is the debate will be over what 's appropriate in the debate .                      
0 0 and you 're already starting to see the forces line up .                                    
0 0 what is appropriate for him to discuss and comment on and what 's not .                              
0 0 and if he 's smart , he 's going to employ the ruth bader ginsberg strategy , which is to not speculate about these things , not talk about things
1 0 it worked for her .                                                  
0 0 it should work for him .                                                
0 0 and much has been made about the fact that there 's not much of a paper trail here .                      
0 0 and people are saying it 's going to work in the democrat 's favor , because -- well , not work in the democrats favor , because rather , they
0 0 but there are some republicans who are also concerned that perhaps he 's not the conservative that they think .                    
0 0 perhaps he 's a little bit more moderate .                                          
0 0 and they just do n't know .                                              
1 0 they do n't have anything to go on .                                          
0 0 will that hurt the conservatives , as well ?                                          
0 0 nature abhors a vacuum .                                                  
0 0 and a lot of people have a certain information vacuum right now .                                  
0 1 some on the far left , some on the far right are already starting to paint the picture .                      
0 0 they 're wrong to do it , because there should be a full and fair and complete review of him and his background , his qualifications , and ought to
1 0 then they can decide .                                                  
0 0 but not start to speculate this early on .                                          
0 0 well , the president has done his job in nominated mr. roberts .                                  
0 0 now it 's time for the senate to do their homework .                                    
0 0 i mean , that 's their job to advise and consent .                                    
0 0 and to go and to deeply probe into all of his record , not just his record on the court , the d.c. court .          
0 0 that 's a small record , but he also has the 39 cases that he tried .                          
1 0 i mean , was he basically hired help , or did he agree with some of the views of his clients ?                
0 0 we need to find out a little bit more about mr. roberts .                                  
0 0 and we 'll talk about that on the other end of this commercial break .                              
0 0 john roberts ' nomination to the supreme court should be taken up by the senate judiciary committee in late august or early september .            
0 0 will , democrats on the committee split with republicans over roberts ' conservative credentials ?                              
0 0 that 's up next in our `` strategy session . ''                                      
0 0 stay with us .                                                    
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues now on inside politics , with us donna brazile and tory clarke .                      
0 0 judge john roberts was on capitol hill today giving the senators who will vote on his confirmation a closer look .                  
0 0 there has already been strong support for the nominee from republican senators .                                  
0 0 democrats have n't been negative , but they are parsing their comments more carefully .                              
0 0 we 're getting brand new video here now .                                          
0 0 this of course , senator patrick leahy meeting with judge roberts here , one of the many meetings that he 's had on capitol hill this morning and this afternoon
0 0 the two of them close there .                                              
0 0 we have been told by our producer that he is actually talking with leahy , telling him a little bit about how he thought -- the kids thought how cool
0 0 we 've seen some of that video before , rather rambunctious son and the daughter by his wife 's side .                  
0 0 the two of them obviously sharing a moment there .                                        
0 0 i want to ask , you know , there seems to me as if democrats , we have n't heard the kind of language that we expected even from senator
0 1 why is that ?                                                    
1 0 is that strategy ?                                                    
0 0 we 're waiting , we 're stepping back here , or we 've just do n't have what we need to put out a full force attack .    
0 0 now remember , some of these democrats like chuck schumer , ted kennedy , they 're on the judiciary committee , joe biden .            
0 0 they 're going to raise these issues inside the judiciary committee .                                    
0 0 they 're going to raise these questions not before the hearing process , but they 're going to try to set , what i call the parameters of the debate
0 0 will he protect and defend individual rights and liberties and freedoms ?                                    
1 0 and they will look at , again , some of his past cases to see if he falls within , what i call the judicial mainstream .      
0 0 but i looked at ted kennedy 's remarks today and i thought they were pretty good .                          
0 0 i think the senators so far are holding their fire .                                      
0 0 and i think it 's smart strategically .                                            
0 0 i also think it 's the right behavior .                                          
0 0 what 's interesting is the two first sound bites i heard this morning were from democrats .                          
1 0 jim moran , very liberal congressman from here in northern virginia , praising john roberts , and then bob bennett , former counselor for president clinton , praising john roberts
0 0 and one of the most interesting things about this fellow , about whom we 're all learning , is the number of democratic friends he has who are coming out
0 0 now let 's talk about his role in the election 2000 florida recount .                                
0 0 he was really pivotal behind that decision .                                            
0 0 we know , of course , bush got into office after that .                                  
1 1 how damaging is that , that played such a role ?                                      
0 0 is that really going to be politically --                                            
0 0 well , i raised it early on last night when i saw david boies who argued on the gore side , talk about him .          
1 0 david boies knew him and david boies talked about his approach to the law , and while david boies disagreed with him , david boies , i thought , gave
0 0 look , in addition to bush v gore , which of course i strongly disagreed with --                          
0 0 i 'm shocked .                                                    
0 0 brazile : do n't let the word go out .                                        
0 1 but we also have to look at his opinions on voting rights , a lot of voting rights cases come before the supreme court .          
0 1 his position on , i do n't want to sound like a litmus test , but race has been an issue that 's been before the court in the past
0 0 right .                                                        
1 0 and as much as much as i think the number one issue will be abortion , every one of these other items , it 's just been sort of in
0 0 the key question is how the process is conducted .                                        
0 0 ok. we 'll get back in a moment .                                          
1 0 they do n't have an official rule to advise or consent , but interest groups are very interested in the selection of john roberts for the supreme court , and
0 0 that 's next on the `` strategy session . ''                                        
0 0 i 'm wolf blitzer reporting from washington .                                            
0 0 coming up at the top of the hour , washington reacts to the president 's choice for the u.s. supreme court .                
0 0 can john roberts be confirmed ?                                                
0 0 thousands of children are starving to death in northern africa .                                      
0 0 why some say the west is at least partially to blame .                                    
0 0 and it 's a nuclear power in one of the most unstable parts of the world .                          
0 0 what does the future hold for india ?                                            
0 0 my exclusive interview with prime minister manmohan singh .                                          
1 0 all those stories , much more only minutes away on `` wolf blitzer reports . ''                            
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 the strategy session continues on inside politics .                                            
0 0 donna brazile and tory clarke .                                                
0 0 the abortion rights group naral , came out against the roberts nomination even before president bush made his announcement last night .                
0 1 and as we reported earlier , progress for america says it 's going to spend millions of dollars on tv ads and other efforts to support the choice of roberts
0 0 just how much impact will outside groups have on the confirmation process ?                                  
0 0 what was very interesting here is that both sides really stand to gain if this person is -- well if you throw red meat and people go running , here
0 0 the fact that that has not happened , both sides tend to lose money .                              
0 0 i mean , that is the bottom line , the honest truth .                                  
1 1 both of those groups tend to lose money here .                                        
0 0 is this a good thing ?                                                
0 0 well , they have a war room set up i 'm sure , on both sides of the political equation .                  
0 0 the right will have their war rooms to support this candidate and to make sure that he gets through the senate and of course , the left will have their
0 0 so , i think -- look , i think one of the sleeper issues that we did n't mention in the last segment is the environment .      
0 0 i mean , he has made some controversial statements on the environment , on the endangered species act , on allowing coal companies to strip mountaintops .      
0 0 that 's going to be a sleeper issue .                                          
1 0 so -- and pretty soon you 'll hear from all of these groups on both the left and the right .                  
1 1 separation of church -- there 's just so much that people will jump up and shout about .                        
1 0 and tori , let 's talk about strategy real quick , because these ads have come out and we have a poll here that shows that ad campaigns -- whether
0 0 sure .                                                        
1 1 all of this money being put out there in the last 24 hours .                                
0 0 how effective is that as a strategy ?                                            
0 0 well , i think it 's to be determined .                                        
0 0 i think people are increasingly skeptical and cynical about the role of these advocacy groups on both sides .                      
0 0 i think the good news is : these advocacy groups are going to be under a lot of scrutiny .                    
0 0 not as much as the nominee , but a lot of scrutiny , which is a good thing .                      
0 0 so , how they behave , how they execute their strategies will come under a lot of intense scrutiny .                    
0 0 i think that 's a very , very good thing .                                      
0 0 they ought to be .                                                  
1 0 i find it a little distressing -- tens-of- millions of dollars .                                    
0 0 i mean we 'll never know the real figure , but there 's going to be so much money spent on this for rhetoric that was written before the nominee
1 0 it 's all about the first amendment and these groups love to talk .                                
1 0 they love to organize and they 're in the business of agitating just about everybody .                            
0 0 and they 've managed to do that .                                            
0 0 i get it from both sides .                                              
0 0 i get the blogs .                                                  
0 0 i get the material .                                                  
0 0 i guess the press releases .                                                
0 0 they 're ready .                                                    
1 0 they 're ready .                                                    
0 0 they 're locked and loaded and ready for battle .                                        
1 0 well , we 'll see if it pays off .                                        
1 0 thank you very much , both of you , for joining us today .                                
1 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 thank you .                                                      
0 0 he is no longer the lead story , but he has not been forgotten .                              
0 0 up next , bloggers are still debating karl rove and the cia leak story .                              
0 0 we 'll rejoin our blog reporters next .                                            
0 0 the john roberts ' nomination was not the only topic on capitol hill today .                              
1 0 senators heard testimony on a proposed federal shield law that would protect journalists who use confidential sources .                        
0 0 cnn 's kathleen koch has more .                                              
1 0 last week before the grand jury probing the valerie plame leak case , `` time '' magazine correspondent matt cooper was a reluctant witness .          
1 0 but wednesday , he was eager to tell senators , journalists need a federal shield law , so they ca n't be forced to break their promise of confidentiality .
0 0 right now , if i pick up the phone and call a senator or his or her staff or a civil servant and they say `` do n't quote me
0 0 both the house and the senate are considering bills to create a federal law preventing reporters from being compelled to identify their sources .            
1 0 the justice department , in written testimony , opposed that warning quote , `` the bill would create serious impediments to the department 's ability to effectively enforce the law
1 0 lawmakers sponsoring the measure made a last-minute change to address that concern .                                  
1 0 under our revised bill , a reporter could not be compelled to reveal a source unless the disclosure of the identity of a source is necessary to prevent imminent or
1 0 some worry that would give the federal government too much leeway .                                    
0 0 the government for its own purposes , can brand it national security when it should n't be .                        
1 0 thirty-one states now have shield laws guarding a reporter 's right to keep a source confidential .                          
0 0 witnesses insisted the nation will suffer if sources are increasingly afraid to come forward .                              
0 0 serious journalism would virtually cease to exist , in my view .                                    
1 0 wrong-doing would not be uncovered .                                                
1 0 we would never have learned about the crimes known as watergate or the massive fraud called enron .                        
1 0 one columnist said the jailing of his colleague `` new york times '' reporter judith miller was already having a chilling effect on his statements about federal prosecutors .  
0 0 because any harsh criticism of them from me might we 'll be taken out on her , i am constrained to speak gently , as if concerned about the treatment
1 0 some had hoped the high-profile leak case would put a federal shield law on the fast track , but most now admit its progress will be slowed as lawmakers focus

1 1 karl rove is out of the spotlight , but he 's still a big topic for left-leaning bloggers .                      
0 0 let 's rejoin cnn political producer abbi tatton and jacki schechner , our blog reporter -- jacki ?                        
0 0 suzanne , that 's just what they 're saying , `` keep it in the spotlight . ''                        
0 0 `` let 's not let the valarie plame affair and karl rove 's role in it , slip out of the mainstream media 's attention . ''      
0 0 over at `` bringiton '' -- this is the unitedamerican.blogs.com , they 're calling it the `` political shell game , '' saying , `` it 's all going to

0 0 `` keep our eye on the ball , '' that , `` the bush administration is on the ropes because of karl rove and the policy of deceit and this
0 0 and pushing this story ahead for the liberal bloggers today , is an article published in the `` american prospect . ''                
0 0 `` that 's an unlikely story . ''                                            
0 0 you can see here from memorandum.com , lots of people linking to it .                                
0 0 in that article , it 's suggested that karl rove in an initial meeting with the fbi , did not disclose discussions he 'd had with `` time '' magazine
0 0 liberal bloggers jumping all over this .

0 0 in a post entitled `` oops , '' what he 's saying is , `` well , this is the kind of thing that got martha stewart in trouble ,
0 0 but as you mentioned before , something else you 're seeing from the left is this walk-and-chew-gum for the mainstream media .                
1 0 they want to keep it in the spotlight .                                          
0 0 yes , the supreme court nomination is very , very important , but so is the karl rove story .                    
0 0 we 're seeing that over at `` dailykos '' as well , saying that progressive bloggers are able to do that , to keep more than one story alive at
0 0 they can walk and chew gum , they say .                                        
0 0 something else we wanted to show you -- a really cool visual over at `` the whiskey bar . ''

0 0 it 's a take-off on custard 's last stand .

    welcome back to `` inside politics . ''                                            
    a live picture there , cincinnati , ohio .                                          
    the 107th annual convention of the naacp .                                            
0 0 hillary clinton , the democratic nominee , soon-to-be democratic nominee for president , expected to address that group .                      
0 0 she 's running a little late .                                              
0 0 when she speaks , cnn will take you there live .                                      
0 0 proves the point that this is donald trump 's big week , but that does n't mean that hillary will completely yield the stage .          
0 0 you 'll see her there courting african-american voters .                                          
0 0 she also has some important outreach to labor unions this week .                                    
0 0 and guess what , by the time the week is over , she needs to do what donald trump did last week .              
0 0 donald trump put mike pence on the republican ticket .                                        
0 0 hillary clinton has to make her choice to fill the democratic ticket .                                  
0 0 so , it used to be tradition that the other party kind of was quiet , but now that the conventions are back to back , because the stakes are
0 0 number one , let 's start with , she 's going to respond to baton rouge , she 's going to talk about this crisis in america .    
0 0 a trust crisis and a violence crisis in our communities .                                      
0 0 inside the clinton campaign , what do they think the best contrast to donald trump is ?                          
1 0 i think that you 're going to see her pick up on some of the comments that republicans broadly have been making .              
0 0 another president has been making about police , and about the need to show more respect for police , and obviously , not turn this anger against law enforcement .
0 0 but i also think you 're going to see her look at this through a racial lens in a way that republicans are still a bit uncomfortable with .  
0 0 and i think you 're going to hear her talking about broader issues that inflict communities and how these divisions that we 're seeing so publicly this summer , how
0 0 and these are tensions that have built up over a decade , so look for a broader message from her than simply law enforcement .          
1 0 and i mentioned criminal justice reform earlier .                                            
0 0 this has now become a big part of her campaign , particularly in the primary campaign as she tried to sort of distance herself from 19 -- from the bill
0 0 so , watch her make that case , that there needs to be some reform to the criminal justice system .                  
0 0 and some of that probably maybe not mentioned a whole lot tonight here ...                                
1 1 and that 's one of the remarkable -- i called it `` parallel universe '' the two parties live in , is if you 're hillary clinton , you 're
0 0 if you 're donald trump and you 're trying to , number one , assert yourself as a conservative , it 's very different tone under very the same issue
0 0 let 's stick on secretary clinton , though .                                          
0 0 she -- if you look at battleground state polling , she 's in pretty good shape .                          
0 0 most national polls have her with a narrow lead in this race , with a very narrow lead .                      
0 0 this is a very competitive race .                                              
0 0 and like donald trump , she has some issues .                                        
0 0 here 's one of them .                                                
0 0 our new cnn/orc poll among bernie sanders voters , people who supported bernie sanders in the primaries , clinton now gets 57 percent of their votes , donald trump gets
0 0 gary johnson , the libertarian candidate , gets 23 percent of the votes and jill stein , the green party candidate , 12 percent of the votes .    
0 0 now , bernie sanders just endorsed her last week .                                        
0 0 she had the fbi director dump on her pretty hard just a little more than a week ago .                      
0 0 so maybe some of this is a reaction , and maybe these numbers are a little higher than some other polls .                
0 0 but if 40 percent of bernie sanders ' voters are shopping elsewhere , that 's a problem .                        
1 0 it 's a huge problem for her because we talk about the obama coalition , young people were a major part of the obama coalition .        
0 0 they were active supporters for bernie sanders .                                            
0 0 and i actually talked to a lot of young voters last week , was calling around .                          
0 0 and gary johnson and jill stein are in the mix for young voters .                                
0 0 they do not see this as a two-way race between hillary clinton and donald trump .                            
0 0 that 's scary if you 're hillary clinton .                                          
1 0 but i also think that 's why you 're seeing the re-emergence of elizabeth warren a little bit .                      
0 0 she met with hillary , i believe it was earlier this week .                                  
0 0 i feel like everything is blending together at this point .                                      
0 0 but she also was in a tweet storm against donald trump again and is very much putting herself out there again .                
0 0 so , keeping her in contention can not hold hillary clinton .                                    
1 0 a number like that , if you keep thinking at this point , ok , where are the pressures on hillary clinton ?              
0 0 what does she need to fill the ticket , balance the ticket , get deal with a weakness , fortify a strength ?              
0 0 that 's the calculation you go through .                                            
0 0 you made the point , we had elizabeth warren , well , let 's look at some of the people in the contention .            
0 0 that 's governor hickenlooper of colorado came to see hillary clinton last week .                                
0 0 tim kaine , the virginia senator she was with on the campaign trail .                                
0 0 tom vilsack , not the agriculture secretary , former iowa governor .                                    
0 0 you see elizabeth warren right there in the middle .                                        
0 0 no accident , i guess , that she 's there .                                      
0 0 the housing and urban development -- excuse me secretary julian castro .                                    
0 0 and the labor secretary , tom perez .                                            
0 0 now , people were saying , if she want to make outreach to latinos , you look at castro or perez .                
0 0 but if your number one issue is blue-collar , working voters , i think two speeches to labor unions this weekend as well .            
0 0 if that 's your issue , and if you talk to michigan democrats , they tell you they are freaked .                  
0 0 autoworker , people like that , that the polling might say one thing .                                
0 0 they say you sit down in a bar with these guys and they are not voting for hillary clinton .                    
1 0 there could be one issue with going with tim kaine , because he was a supporter of free trade agreements , supporter of the trade proportion authority that passed ,
0 0 so , that 's one of the risk and that 's one of reasons why she may be looking at some more popular democrats , people like sherrod brown of
0 0 but he also has a problem because john kasich is the governor of his state who is named his internal replacement .                
1 0 and any of these people are going to be problematic in one way or another because if you pick someone , you 're giving something else up .    
0 0 so if you 're going after this white sort of reagan , you know , so-called reagan democrats , then you 're going to aim for a different pick than
0 0 but , you know , i remain skeptical of how much of a demographic group or how much of a state any v.p .            
0 0 picks feel , you know , will really bring you on a ticket .                                
0 0 i think elizabeth warren is sort of the `` x '' factor in all of that .                          
0 0 she 's proven herself to be a very capable attack dog against donald trump .                              
0 0 and she speaks to the bernie sanders voters in a way that i do n't think anyone else on that list we would looking at , well he does .
1 0 but the question has always been , would hillary clinton do that ?                                  
0 0 would she pick somebody who in some ways might overshadow her ?                                    
1 0 it 's very hard to see elizabeth warren , in particular because she needs also a governing partner .                      
0 0 how does she work with someone who 's -- has a lot of different issues in her , someone who 's clearly not a dealmaker ?        
0 0 and when you 're a governor -- when you 're governing and you 're an executive , you have to be a dealmaker .            
1 0 i agree because -- i mean it 's less likely that she picks warren than any of the other candidates on that list .            
0 0 but one thing to keep in mind , in clinton headquarters , there is nothing that has energized that group of people more than elizabeth warren and seeing how she
0 0 they think she is incredibly effective , more effective than anyone else , really .                              
1 0 one other interesting thing that we 're going to see this week is the president of the united states .                    
0 0 and the white house said today , this is just a coincidence .                                  
0 0 it 's a part of the calendar , the president 's having an vent to mark a key date on the muslim religious calendar this week .      
0 0 but then on friday , the day after the republican convention ends , the president of mexico is coming to the white house .            
0 0 now , the white house says this is just a coincidence , that after donald trump 's convention .                      
0 0 and i think we 're going to hear at least once or twice that he would like to build a wall and he wants mexico to pay for it .
0 0 is this mischief by the president ?                                              
1 0 you can only look at that way , because if you remember , these two leaders just met a few weeks ago in canada at a north american leader 's
0 0 it 's not as though they have n't seen each other in a while .                              
0 0 so , the timing of this is curious .                                          
1 0 and , you know , that goes back to the v.p .                                    
0 0 picks .                                                        
0 0 they 're either few hispanic potential candidates on that list .                                      
0 0 she may not even need to go that route to get the latino vote , you do n't need to go that ralph because trump is doing very , very
0 0 and we saw what happened to him , especially in those key battleground states .                              
1 0 if you could look behind me in the floor , you could see it 's starting to fill in .                    
0 0 the republican convention will be gaveled to order in about 23 minutes , if my math is right .                      
0 0 you see the delegates starting to fill in to the halls .                                    
0 0 it 's an exciting time here in cleveland .                                          
0 0 up next , our reporter share from their notebooks , including a series of surprises that top convention planners , well , let 's just say , they have no
0 0 we 'll still waiting for secretary of state , former secretary of state hillary clinton to speak to the naacp in cincinnati , ohio .          
0 0 we are told she is just moments away .                                          
0 0 we 'll take you there live once she starts to speak .                                    
0 0 as always on `` inside politics , '' let 's go around the table here , ask our reporters to share little something from their notebooks , get you out
0 0 manu ?                                                        
1 1 we talked about john kasich earlier in the show and the trump campaign not happy with him .                        
0 0 but also a number of ohio delegates are not happy with him either .                                
0 0 i talked to some of them , including the republican congressman from the cleveland area jim renacci , who told me , `` i think republicans too many times are
0 0 you 're hearing a message of unity and some frustration from republicans here in ohio about their governor .                      
0 0 king : about their governor .                                                
0 0 ok , we 'll see if john kasich changes his plans , but does n't look like it .                      
0 0 he 's a pretty stubborn guy .                                              
0 0 i 've known him for a while .                                            
0 0 julie ?                                                        
1 1 donald trump advisers say , one of the reasons that he 's excited about having mike pence on the ticket is because pence likes to fundraise .      
0 0 trump is getting more comfortable with the idea of asking people for money but still loathes the process in general .                  
0 0 and one adviser told me that when trump learned of pence 's fundraising skills , he turned to pence and said `` do i have a job for you ?
0 0 so this can come both ways .                                              
0 0 there are some donors who might like to hear from pence more than trump .                              
0 0 but donors also like to know that the top of the ticket is invested .                              
0 0 so he risks turning this completely over to pence .                                        
1 0 what we do know , the republicans are behind his money , so that matters .                            
0 0 sara ?                                                        
1 1 well , all eyes of course are here on that convention , but while this is happening , the trump campaign is preparing for this august push in battleground states
0 0 now , they 've of course gotten a lot of flack about their ground game and not having as much of a presence as clinton .        
0 0 they say they 're never going to have as big of a footprint as hillary clinton and barack obama , but they do n't need it .      
0 0 but they are going to release today a list of state directors , advisers in more than dozen battleground states that include places like michigan and maine .    
0 0 they feel like they 're laying the groundwork .                                          
0 0 and you 're going to see much more of the traditional blocking and tackling starting in august .                        
0 0 and they are pushing back hard against this narrative that they are anywhere behind in the ground game .                      
1 0 jackie ?                                                        
1 1 donald trump has promised a convention full of surprises , but usually you do n't have the rnc also being surprised .                
0 0 this time , they 're having to kind of go with the flow because they 're dealing with a nominee who is extending invitations and deciding , he 's going
0 0 look at scott baio , working on the program until very recently and that 's because donald trump just invited him .                
0 0 so , we 're all just kind of waiting with bated breath and the includes the rnc .                        
1 0 when it comes to scott baio , a lot expecting and the answer but a `` why '' .                      
1 0 why not ?                                                      
1 0 i guess we 'll find out right there .                                          
0 0 now , who 's not here in cleveland , this is is as big of a part of conversation as who is attending .            
0 0 many republican luminaries , you probably heard , are skipping , including the two living former republican presidents , george h.w .                
0 0 bush and george w. bush , or as called in family lingo , 41 and 43 .                          
0 0 they will not be here in cleveland , but they were also not in tampa for mitt romney four years ago .                
0 0 as you see things happen there .                                              
0 0 for 41 , george w. bush , that ended his streak of appearing at eight consecutive gop conventions .                      
0 0 another bush family streak ends this week here in cleveland .                                      
0 0 the two presidents ' bush did not speak in capitol four years ago , but jeb bush did .                      
0 0 jeb bush also is n't coming to donald trump 's coronation .                                    
0 0 you might remember , they do n't like each other , and so this streak will end right here .                    
0 0 at least one bush has spoken at every republican convention since 1980 .                                  
0 0 we 're still waiting to hear hillary clinton speaking in cincinnati .                                    
0 0 she is speaking now at the naacp convention .                                          
0 0 let 's listen .                                                    
1 0 more black men killed in police incidents , this time in louisiana and minnesota .                              
0 0 and then in dallas , five police officers killed while serving and protecting peaceful protesters , targeted because they were police .                
0 0 and then , of course , yesterday , three police officers murdered in an apparent premeditated ambush in baton rouge .                  
0 0 this madness has to stop .                                                
0 0 watching the news from baton rouge yesterday , my heart broke .                                    
0 0 not just for those officers and their grieving families , but for all of us .                            
0 0 we have difficult , painful , essential work ahead of us to repair the bonds between our police and our communities and between and among each other .    
0 0 we need one another to do this work .                                          
0 0 and we need leaders like the naacp .                                            
0 0 we need police officers to help us make progress .                                        
0 0 these murders threaten all of that .                                              
0 0 killing police officers is a terrible crime .                                            
0 0 that 's why our laws treat the murders of police so seriously , because they represent the rule of law itself .                
0 0 if you take aim at that and at them , you take aim at all of us .                        
0 0 anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable .                              
0 0 and as president , i will bring the fool weight of the law to there and making sure those who kill police officers are brought to justice .    
0 0 there can be no justification , no looking the other way .                                    
0 0 we all have to make sure and pray it ends .                                      
0 0 the officers killed yesterday in baton rouge were named montrell jackson , matthew gerald , brad garafola .                        
0 0 when they died , they were responding to a call about a man with a gun .                          
0 0 how many families , how many more families would be paying the price if we did not have brave men and women answering those calls ?        
0 0 that 's why i 'm haunted by the image of what the officers in dallas were doing when they died , protecting a peaceful march , talking with the protesters
0 0 where would our democracy be without courageous people willing to do that ?                                  
0 0 so we all need to be partners in making law enforcement as secure and effective as it needs to be .                  
0 0 that means investing in our police , in training on the proper use of force , especially lethal force , how to avoid using force to resolve incidents .  
0 0 officer safety and wellness , everything they need to do their jobs right and rebuild trust with their communities .                    
0 0 i 've said from the beginning of my campaign , that will be my priority as president .                        
0 0 and perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better .      
0 0 the deaths of alton and philando drove home how urgently we need to make reforms to policing and criminal justice .                  
0 0 how we can not rest until we root out implicit bias and stop the killings of african- americans .                      
0 0 because there is , as you know so well , another hard truth at the heart of this complex matter .                  
0 0 many african-americans fear the police .                                                
0 0 i can hear you .                                                  
0 0 some of you in this room .                                              
0 0 and today there are people all across america sick over what happened in baton rouge and in dallas but also fearful that the murders of police officers means that vital
0 0 now , that is a reasonable fear , is n't it ?                                    
0 0 and all of this tells us very powerfully that we have to change .                                
0 0 many police officers across the country agree with that .                                        
0 0 but it can only happen if we build trust and accountability .                                    
0 0 and let 's admit it that gets harder every time someone else is killed .                              
1 0 and let 's admit it , there is clear evidence that african-americans are disproportionately killed in police incidents , compared to any other group .          
0 0 and african-american men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police , charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the
0 0 these facts tell us something is profoundly wrong .                                          
0 0 we ca n't ignore that .                                                
0 0 we ca n't wish it away .                                              
0 0 we have to make it right .                                              
0 0 that means end- to-end reform in our criminal justice system , not half measures , but a full commitment with real follow-through .              
0 0 that 's why the very first speech i gave in this campaign back in april of 2015 was about criminal justice reform .              
0 0 and the next president should make a commitment to fight for the reforms we so desperately need .                        
0 0 holding police departments like ferguson accountable .                                              
0 0 requiring accurate data on in-custody deaths , like sandra bland .                                      
0 0 creating clear national guidelines on the use of force , especially lethal force .                                
0 0 supporting independent investigations of fatal encounters with the police .                                        
0 0 so , i pledge to you , i will start taking action on day one and every day after that until we get this done .        
0 0 and you know what ?                                                  
0 0 when the 24-hour news cycle moves on , i wo n't .                                    
0 0 this is too important .                                                  
0 0 this goes to the heart of who we are .                                        
0 0 this is about our character as americans .                                            
0 0 that 's why we also need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration , eliminate the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine            
0 0 dismantle the school to prison pipeline that starts in school and diverts too many african-american kids out of school and into the criminal justice system , instead of giving them
0 0 and we need to do , all of us need to do , and i look forward to working with the naacp .              
0 0 we need to do a much better job helping people who have paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out .        
0 0 you know , america is well known , and we want to be a land of second chances .                      
0 0 but so many americans never had a first chance to begin with .                                  
0 0 so , let 's give everyone a fair chance at rebuilding their lives .                                
0 0 as abraham lincoln said , give everyone a fair chance in the race of life .                            
0 0 my plan would make significant investments in re-entry programs for those formally incarcerated .                                
0 0 and i will ban the box in the federal government .                                      
0 0 people deserve a real shot at an interview , instead of being told no right out of the gate .                    
0 0 and then beyond criminal justice , we must , we must fight for common-sense reforms to stop gun violence .                    
1 0 you 've been listening to hillary clinton speaking at the naacp convention in cincinnati , ohio , not far from where we are .            
0 0 we 're just a little while away in cleveland .                                        
0 0 we 're here inside the convention hall .                                            
0 0 we want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world .                              
0 0 i 'm wolf blitzer reporting .                                                
0 0 as this republican national convention kicks off today , the gavel will drop in just a few minutes to get all the action officially started .        
0 0 the theme for this first day of the convention is `` make america safe again '' and that includes the national security and immigration .          
0 0 several top republicans will speak on those issues throughout the day and into the evening .                            
0 0 former texas governor rick perry among them , along with senators jeff sessions , tom cotton and joni ernst .                    
0 0 also , former new york city mayor rudy giuliani , he will be speaking tonight .                            
0 0 retired lieutenant general michael flynn , the former head of the defense intelligence agency , had been under consideration for the vice presidential slot .          
0 0 also speaking tonight is pat smith .                                              
0 0 she is the mother of shawn smith , one of four americans who were killed during that attack in benghazi , libya .              
0 0 two u.s. marine corps veterans who fought in the benghazi battle will also speak .                              
0 0 but the headliner tonight will be melania trump , donald trump 's wife and prospective first lady of the united states , if in fact , he is elected .
0 0 donald trump certainly has pinned a lot of his hopes on her .                                  
0 0 and you see what 's going on the floor .                                        
0 0 pretty soon we 'll be seeing all of this unfold .                                      
0 0 it 's an important moment right now .                                            
0 0 the gavel will be called to order .                                            
0 0 reince priebus , the chairman of the republican national committee , he will introduce that call to order .                      
0 0 there will be a presentation of colors by the cuyahoga county veterans .                                  
0 0 that is the county here in cleveland .                                            
0 0 presentation of colors by the cuyahoga county veterans and then there will be the national anthem .                          
0 0 there will be an invocation by rabbi ari wolf of cleveland .                                    
0 0 he 's a police chaplain .                                                
0 0 colors will be retired .                                                  
0 0 there 'll be musical .                                                  
0 0 people have gathered here .                                                  
0 0 there will be a business session that will take place here on the floor of the republican national convention in cleveland .                
0 0 we have an extensive panel of guests , analysts , reporters who are with us here .                          
0 0 we 'll be covering all of this as we watch it unfold .                                  
0 0 david gregory , you 're among the panel .                                          
0 0 this is an important moment , because it 's officially going to be not only the republican national convention , but the trump national convention .        
0 0 his fingerprints are all over this agenda .                                            
1 0 all over this , because this is now donald trump 's republican party .                                
0 0 and if there are republicans around the country , official capacity or otherwise , they have to get right with that .                
0 0 and this is an opportunity for trump to do something he has not done up until now , which is really unify the party .          
0 0 that 's a lot of witness convention is about .

    president bush puts the work into his working vacation , taking to the road to tout his legislative achievements .                    
    i 'll be signing next week a comprehensive energy bill and it 's a good piece of legislation .                      
    we 'll take a look mr. bush 's victories and setbacks .                                    
1 0 ... that this is a very lethal and unfortunately , adaptive enemy that we are faced with inside iraq .                    
1 0 a very deadly week for u.s. forces .                                            
0 0 will the violence over there impact the politics back here ?                                      
0 0 an iraq war veteran almost pulls off an amazing upset in ohio .                                  
1 0 there 's nothing to cry about here .                                            
0 0 this was a success .                                                  
0 0 we should all be proud .                                                
0 0 so , let 's rock on .                                              
1 0 is yesterday 's special election a bellwether for next year 's battle for control of congress ?                          
0 0 john roberts responds .                                                    
0 0 the supreme court nominee answers questions posed by senators , but what do his replies reveal ?                          
0 0 now live from washington , cnn 's inside politics .                                        
1 0 thanks for joining us .                                                  
0 0 i 'm joe johns .                                                  
0 0 president bush kicked off his month-long stay in texas today with a speech highlighting the early accomplishments of his second term .                
0 0 in remarks to state lawmakers he offered a progress report on everything from the just-passed energy and highway bills , to the upcoming battle over his supreme court nominee .
0 0 he also talked about the recent violence in iraq , calling it a grim reminder of the enemies facing america .                  
0 0 cnn 's elaine quijano is traveling with the president .                                        
1 0 on his first full day of a nearly five-week long working vacation , president bush touted his second-term legislative accomplishments .                  
1 0 and finally , after years of work , i 'm proud to announce i 'll be signing next week , a comprehensive energy bill .          
1 0 besides an energy bill , he put a highway bill and the central american free trade agreement in his win column .                
0 0 the president also claimed progress on the economic front .                                        
1 0 employment is up in 48 of the 50 states .                                        
0 0 unemployment is down to 5 percent .                                              
1 0 yet the president has not been able to claim victory on what was supposed to have been the signature legislative agenda item of his second term -- changing social security
1 0 the system is going broke , is what is the problem .                                    
1 0 president bush ran with two major priorities , sweeping domestic changes he wanted to implement .                            
0 0 number one , social security ; number two , tax reform .                                    
0 0 social security is in worse shape now than it was when the president was inaugurated in january in terms of getting any traction .            
1 0 and last week , another political setback for president bush .                                      
0 0 the senate majority leader bill frist broke with the president , expressing support for expanding federal funding of embryonic stem cell research .              
0 0 and of course , joe , president bush has threatened to veto any legislation that will do that -- joe ?                  
1 1 and apparently even in the face of all of that , he is still standing by that veto threat , right , elaine ?            
1 0 that 's correct .                                                    
0 0 the president was asked about this during an interview with texas newspapers recently and the president essentially said that his position , the one that he outlined back in 2001
0 0 he has not changed from that position , the president , saying that he is confident that he has achieved , quote , `` the right balance between science and
1 0 sticking by his guns .                                                  
0 0 thanks so much , elaine quijano .                                              
0 0 president bush also used today 's speech to comment on the situation in iraq .                              
0 0 he stuck to familiar themes , pledging that the u.s. will remain in iraq until the mission is complete and that it would be a mistake to set a timetable
0 0 fourteen marines died in a roadside bombing near the iraqi town of haditha in the euphrates river valley .                      
0 0 the marines belonged to the same ohio battalion that lost six members just two days ago .                          
0 0 mr. bush told his audience that the u.s. forces who have died in battle will not be forgotten .                      
1 0 men and women who lost their lives in iraq and afghanistan and in this war on terror , have died in a noble cause and a selfless cause .  
0 0 their families can know that american citizens pray for them .                                      
0 0 and the families can know that we will honor their loved one 's sacrifice by completing the mission .                      
1 0 with me now to talk more about the situation in iraq and other issues is senator george allen of virginia .                  
0 0 he joins me from capitol hill .                                              
0 0 thanks so much , senator allen , for speaking with me .                                    
0 0 eighteen hundred u.s. lives lost over there now .                                          
0 0 there are some suggestions that the attacks are becoming fewer but more lethal .                                
0 0 what 's the strategy ?                                                  
0 0 and do you think there is a real possibility for at least some of the troops to start coming home as early as next year ?        
1 1 well , i think you are going to have to look at several factors and progress and benchmarks in the future .                
0 0 i think , first of all , we 'll be able to have our troops stand down as iraqis are able to stand up and protect themselves .    
0 0 on the political front , one of the key things will be this constitution .                              
0 0 if they can get this constitution drafted -- and one that respects individual rights , that rights are not enhanced nor diminished on the account of religious beliefs or because
0 0 that 's the political front .                                                
0 0 on the security front , obviously training more iraqis to take care of their own country will be essential .                    
0 0 the electricity , the water , the sewer , oil production being improved -- all of those will be important , as well as in the schools , by the
0 0 i think there 's progress , but it is very , very difficult , whether it 's the constitution or whether that is the training of iraqis .    
0 0 the terrorists , whether they are remnants of saddam 's regime or whether they are al qaeda , these people do not have any other motive other than to wreak
0 0 but i do n't think that 's going to win the hearts and minds of iraqis .                          
0 0 but ...                                                        
1 1 senator , it does ...                                                  
1 1 i 'm positive , i 'm optimistic , but recognize that this is going to be very difficult and a treacherous land .              
1 0 it does seem as though the administration continues to have problems with public relations on these issues .                        
0 0 do you think there 's anything the administration should be doing that it has n't been doing with regard to p.r .                
0 0 ?                                                          
1 1 well , to the extent that you all with cnn or any others can talk about some of the positive things in areas that are safe , that would be
0 0 i 'm not going to criticize the media , though .                                      
0 0 when you have the tragic killing of 14 americans , naturally that 's going to -- and understandably that 's going to -- get attention .        
0 0 but there is progress .                                                  
0 0 and i think that there will be certain benchmarks with a constitution that i think people will see an uptick , let 's say , in support and understanding just
0 0 and people want to see those sort of benchmarks .                                        
0 0 and when they occur , i think there will be more support .                                  
0 0 and i think most americans realize this is tough .                                        
0 0 we 're going to have to persevere .                                            
0 0 but , most of all , we want to see the iraqis taking control of their own destiny and their own security .              
0 0 so , senator , now quickly , let 's talk a little bit about domestic politics .                          
0 0 you have certainly been mentioned as one of those people who might be running for the white house next time around .                
0 0 where do you stand on that ?                                              
0 0 what , running for the white house ?                                            
1 1 yes .                                                        
1 0 is that what you 're saying , joe ?                                          
0 0 i 'm running for re-election next year , is my political focus right now .                              
0 0 i have been encouraged by many outstanding individuals for whom i have a great deal of respect , who had worked , for example , in the reagan administration .
0 0 so i 'm going to keep advocating the advancement of freedom and making sure this country is the world capital of innovation , with better tax policies and better education
1 0 now , when the congress returns , obviously , one of the big things the senate will be focusing on is the roberts nomination for the supreme court .  
0 0 you met with judge roberts .                                                
0 0 what 's your assessment of him ?                                              
0 0 allen : well , i very much enjoyed talking with judge roberts .                                  
0 0 we had a good conversation , maybe 45 minutes .                                        
0 0 he 's a scholar , a legal scholar .                                          
0 0 but you know the good thing about him ?                                          
0 0 he does n't talk like a lawyer .                                            
0 0 he clearly understands the law .                                                
0 0 what i care most about , is judges who understand their responsibility is to apply the law , not invent the law .              
0 0 he understands the constitution and that the constitution should not be amended by judicial decree .                            
0 0 and we talked about things such as precedent and how important that is , but when precedent might not be ultimately controlling and stultifying .          
0 0 asked him about how you protect individual rights , how you interpret state laws , when the federal government should or should not be taking over the rights and prerogatives
0 0 but i came away from it feeling that he was well-grounded , has the right judicial philosophy .                        
0 0 i think he 'll be an outstanding member of the supreme court .                                  
0 0 moreover , on the supreme court i think that he 'll be one that will be able to persuade other justices to his point of view .      
0 0 and some of that 's just his demeanor .                                          
0 0 and i like the fact that he cuts his own grass .                                    
0 0 another issue that you have been heavily involved with is the issue of stem cell research .                          
0 0 we 've already talked about it on the program just a little bit .                                
0 0 what 's your view ?                                                  
0 0 is the administration going to be able to sidestep a confrontation with the republican congress on this issue ?                      
1 0 probably not .                                                      
0 0 every senator is going to come up to this , and whatever number of bills , i do n't know how many different proposals we 'll ultimately have before us
0 0 what i 'm looking to do is find a way that we can advance stem cell research in a way that it actually helps people .        
0 0 and of course adult stem cell research right now is finding cures and helping people .                            
0 0 so far as the embryonic stem cell research , there are three filters that i 'm using .                        
0 0 one is the scientific advancement filter .                                              
0 0 the other is , what is appropriate for federal funding ?                                      
0 0 the third is the ethical or the ethics controversy .                                        
0 0 i think with some of the advancements in technology and science , there are ways of deriving stem cells , embryonic-type stem cells , that have all that flexibility and
0 0 if we can do that , that 's good for science .                                    
0 0 it 's logical for funding .                                                
0 0 it also avoids the ethical controversy .                                              
0 0 and the fact of the matter is that the question is whether or not there should be federal funding .                    
0 0 and it 's not as if the federal government is the only one who can fund this .                        
0 0 the state of california has put in $ 3 billion for such research , as have other states and the private sector .              
0 0 so maybe if we can find and craft a measure which gets embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo , that is the plus-plus approach for advancements in the research
1 0 senator george allen of virginia , thanks so much for joining us .                                  
0 0 let 's stay in touch during august .                                            
1 0 ok. will do .                                                    
1 0 you bet .                                                      
0 0 more on john roberts in his own words , straight ahead .                                    
0 0 a first look at roberts ' views of the role of judges , his judicial philosophy , even his favorite football team .              
0 0 and it 's never too early to take a poll .                                      
0 0 with planning for 2008 already in progress , we 'll tell you how americans view giuliani , mccain and hillary clinton .                
0 0 and later , senator bill frist takes a stand on stem cell research and appears to get passed over for an encore appearance at judicial sunday .      
0 0 as we mentioned , supreme court nominee john roberts has responded to a senate questionnaire with more information about his private and professional life .          
0 0 senators are expected to use the information during roberts ' confirmation hearings next month , but so far , several key questions remain unanswered .          
1 0 it reads like an application for membership to an exclusive club , which the supreme court is in a way .                  
0 0 questions from the senate judiciary committee to supreme court nominee john roberts , covering seemingly every aspect of his life .                  
0 0 we learn roberts was phi beta kappa , had no military service , later joined a tony country club .                    
1 0 he speaks in generalizations , so there 's nothing really that anybody can pick up on and complain about .                    
1 0 he acknowledged press reports stating he was a member of the federalist society , a conservative legal group , but claimed he had no recollection of ever being formally in
0 0 what many lawmakers really wanted , what the judge thinks about hot button issues like abortion and the death penalty .                  
0 0 here roberts was not asked for specifics and did n't offer any .                                  
0 0 instead , he outlined a general conservative judicial philosophy .                                        
0 0 judges , he said , must have a limited role .                                      
0 0 `` they do not have a commission to solve society 's problems as they see them , but simply to decide cases before them according to the rule of law
0 0 roberts said legal precedents like roe versus wade , were important -- quote -- `` to promoting stability of the legal system . ''            
0 0 several abortion rights groups criticize the lack of specifics , but legal experts say upcoming hearings could prove more fruitful .                  
1 0 we can anticipate , as he did , that he 's going to say that precedent is very important .                    
0 0 but he 's not going to say that it 's necessarily controlling in every case .                            
0 0 and i think 99 percent of the judges in this country would agree with that .                            
0 0 the devil is in the details , as it always is .                                    
1 0 there is also little to learn from roberts ' legal work for george w. bush during the 2000 florida recount .                  
0 0 court sources have said he was a key behind-the-scenes player , helping draft all the important legal appeals on which the presidency would turn .          
0 0 but roberts would only acknowledge spending a week in tallahassee at the request of gop lawyers , helping governor jeb bush , the future president 's brother .    
0 0 as for money , roberts has plenty .                                            
0 0 he lists his net worth at $ 5.3 million , including a big house in an exclusive washington suburb , lucrative stock investments , with a portfolio that includes time
0 0 we have also learned a little about the selection process roberts went through .                                
0 0 he met first with attorney general gonzales april 1 , a month later with a group including vice president cheney and deputy chief of staff karl rove .    
0 0 this was weeks before justice sandra day o'connor decided to retire .                                    
0 0 after that news , white house contacts with roberts intensified , culminating with the july 15 meeting with president bush that sealed the nomination .          
0 0 john roberts also spoke out today on a matter close to the hearts of washingtonians , their redskins football team .                  
0 0 the matter came up as roberts appeared at a photo op with senator george allen , who just appeared , whose father was a former redskins coach .    
0 0 asked if he was a redskins fan , roberts replied , sure , but added the caveat that he grew up a fan of the buffalo bills and still has
0 0 on the baseball front , roberts refused to reveal his loyalties between the washington nationals or the baltimore orioles , saying , i 'm not going there .    
0 0 are you ready for the next race for the white house ?                                    
0 0 it 's still three years away , but that 's not stopping pollsters from asking voters who they favor .                    
0 0 we 've got results just ahead .                                              
0 0 it may be the dog days of summer , but that 's not stopping pollsters from turning their sights to the next battle for the white house in 2008 .
0 0 the names might not surprise you -- clinton and mccain , to mention a couple -- but the results might .                  
0 0 here 's our bruce morton .                                                
1 0 fish got to swim , birds got to fly .                                        
0 0 pollsters got to poll , too , even when they 're looking way down the road .                          
0 0 so ok , voters , pretend it 's 2008 and it 's senator hillary clinton for the democrats and rudy giuliani for the republicans .          
0 0 registered voters told gallup , rudy wins by five points .                                      
0 0 how about hillary clinton against senator john mccain ?                                          
0 0 he wins by the same margin .                                              
0 0 giuliani and/or mccain against john kerry ?                                              
0 0 they win even bigger .                                                  
0 0 but hey , the 2008 election is more than three years off .                                  
0 0 does this poll mean anything ?                                                
1 0 it 's like trying to predict who 's going to win the super bowl in 2008 .                          
0 0 you know , the season has n't started yet .                                        
0 0 the pre-season has n't started yet .                                              
0 0 training camp has n't started yet .                                              
0 0 we do n't know who the players are going to be , we do n't know who the teams are going to be .            
1 0 gallup also asks about favorable and unfavorable opinions of these people now , today .                              
0 0 americans have a favorable opinion of giuliani , of senator clinton , of senator mccain .                            
0 0 the only guys with negative marks are the two who ran last time , president bush and democrat john kerry .                  
0 0 the poll did n't ask about other wannabes , delaware democratic senator joe biden , for example .                        
1 0 well , i 'm going out to see whether or not anybody but me thinks i should be president .                    
1 0 and on `` the daily show , '' he raised an interesting possibility .                                
1 1 you may end up going against a senate colleague , perhaps mccain , perhaps frist ?                            
1 0 john mccain is a personal friend , a great friend , and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain , because i think the country would
1 0 mccain/biden ?                                                        
0 1 biden/mccain ?                                                        
0 0 a fusion ticket ?                                                    
0 0 have n't seen that since republican abe lincoln ran with democrat andrew johnson in 1864 .                            
0 0 they won , of course , but then lincoln was murdered and johnson was impeached .                            
0 0 maybe not such a good precedent , after all .

1 0 thanks , christine .                                                    
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
0 0 the outcome of yesterday 's special election for ohio 's 2nd district house seat is not in dispute , but the loser and his party are still claiming victory .
0 0 republican jean schmidt got 52 percent of the vote to defeat democrat paul hackett in an area that tilts heavily republican .                
0 0 cnn 's senior political analyst , bill schneider , has more on the surprisingly tight election that caught national attention and why democrats see signs of better things to come
1 0 the republican won .                                                    
1 0 no one would think we would become the focus of the national media or become the so-called first test of the republican party and the bush mandate .    
0 0 well , ladies and gentlemen , we passed the test .                                      
1 0 barely , which is why the democrats are celebrating .                                        
1 0 there 's nothing to cry about here .                                            
0 0 this was a success .                                                  
0 0 we should all be proud .                                                
0 0 so let 's rock on .                                                
1 0 this nonpartisan analyst agrees .                                                  
0 0 the losers have more to celebrate than the winners .                                        
1 0 i think it was a moral victory for them .                                        
1 0 ohio 's 2nd congressional district is one of the reddest districts in the country , 64 percent for bush last year .                
0 1 but when the republican margin slips to 52 percent , the gop could have a problem .                          
0 0 the democrat , paul hackett , an iraq war veteran , was running as a critic of president bush 's war policy .              
1 1 whoa , whoa , whoa , you told us a year-and-a-half ago mission accomplished .                              
0 0 it 's a hell of a lot worse there today .                                      
1 0 suddenly , the race looked interesting .                                              
1 0 both national parties threw a lot of money into this race and ratcheted up the attention .                          
1 0 especially after hackett attacked president bush personally .                                            
0 0 republicans expected to see a backlash against hackett .                                          
0 0 it did n't happen .                                                  
0 0 you expect lower turnout in a mid-summer special election , but the gop lost almost five times as many votes as the democrats .            
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 0 here 's a clue .                                                  
0 0 the latest national gallup poll shows only 48 percent of americans with a favorable personal opinion of bush , down from 60 percent last november .        
0 0 that 's the lowest personal rating bush has ever gotten .                                      
1 0 `` if the war 's conduct resonates so strongly in the 2nd district , its echo is likely to be even louder in the rest of the country next year
1 0 elections are accountability moments , and we do n't have too many of them going on right now .                      
0 0 so , whenever they happen , they do get the attention of politicians and journalists .                            
1 0 this one certainly did .                                                  
0 0 according to mr. cook , republican losses were especially large in the poorer , more rural areas of that district .                  
0 0 those were the kinds of voters who delivered ohio for president bush last year .                              
1 0 near portsmouth , ohio , and around the bend there .                                      
1 0 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 johns : so , is this the kind of thing that creates pressure , more pressure , for example , for the president and the administration to start talking about
0 0 it puts pressure on congressional republicans to talk about that kind of timetable .                                
0 0 you 've seen some movement by republicans in congress to say , we need a timetable .                          
0 0 we want to start the withdrawal process .                                            
0 0 the administration has resisted .                                                  
0 0 you 're going to see more congressional republicans start putting pressure .                                    
0 0 they want a timetable in place before november 2006 .                                        
1 0 thanks so much , bill schneider .                                              
0 0 with me now from cincinnati is the winner of yesterday 's special election in ohio , jean schmidt , the republican .                
0 0 thanks for joining us .                                                  
1 0 thank you for having me on .                                              
1 0 i guess we ought to start at the beginning here .                                      
0 0 a lot of people -- you heard bill just a moment ago -- have called this a referendum on iraq in large part .            
0 0 is that how you see it ?                                              
1 0 no .                                                        
0 0 first off , this was a special election .                                          
0 0 and the dynamics in a special election are not a bellwether for regular elections .                              
0 0 the second thing that i think that the national media is missing is that my opponent , understanding the popularity of the president in this district , actually in his
0 0 so , you 're -- you 're missing a larger picture in this district .                              
1 0 but he 's also someone who called the president a bunch of names as well .                            
0 0 at least , that 's what i 've heard .                                        
0 0 do you think that he simply went too far in the race and there was a backlash ?                        
1 0 when he was making those name-callings , it was in the national press , not in the local press .                    
0 0 and with a very short window of opportunity for the voters of this district to get to know either candidate , it was very , very easy to do a
0 0 in fact , there were republicans in this district , when they saw his ad , that thought he was the republican candidate .            
0 0 nowhere in his ads did he ever say democrat .                                        
0 0 the second thing is , is that you have to look at the uniqueness of this election .                        
0 0 in june , there were 11 of us that ran on the republican ticket .                              
0 0 and there was a front-runner that the people in this district had a passion about , either a love or a hate relationship .            
0 0 and for those that loved him , they voted for him .                                    
0 0 but , for the rest , they were looking at the other 10 candidates as their choice .                        
0 0 once that election was over , the passion and the energy for the august election waned .                          
0 0 they thought , because this had always been a very easy race , that there really was no reason to go back to the polls .        
0 0 they misunderstood the fact that , in the past 20 years , the democrats have not mounted a candidate like mr. hackett .              
0 0 and the democrats have never put as much money into the race as they did with mr. hackett .                      
0 0 and so those were some of the unique features of it .                                    
0 0 the other thing that i think that you 've missed when i heard your analyst is the whole issue of the scioto county .            
0 0 if you understand scioto county , while it appears in part to look more republican- leaning , those independent voters are actually democrats .            
0 0 i have worked on the ground with local campaigns out in scioto county in the last four years , and i can tell you , even though it looks as
1 0 now , of course , the democrats , the day after , are saying the closeness of this race really indicates there 's no safe republican district in this country
0 0 and they 're saying this basically because of the iraq war .                                    
0 0 do you buy that ?                                                  
0 1 obviously not .                                                      
1 0 no , i really do n't .                                              
0 0 the iraq war is , of course , an important issue , and the voters of this district recognize that .                  
0 0 but when i was talking to them over the last four months , the things that they were talking about when we talked about national security was that they wanted
0 0 border patrol is a very serious issue here .                                          
0 0 they also wanted to talk about the president 's tax policy .                                    
0 0 they wanted to keep the tax cuts permanent , because it puts real money into the hands of real individuals .                  
0 0 they want to eliminate the death tax , the capital gains tax , and the alternative minimum tax .                      
0 0 and they want a sound energy policy that moves us away from foreign oil and on to a domestic supply , including drilling in the anwr , taking a look
0 0 so , these were the things that i was hearing time and time again in the district .                        
0 0 the national media was trying to focus on the war .                                      
1 0 one last question .                                                    
0 0 one last question .                                                    
0 0 just wanted to jump in .                                                
1 0 sure .                                                        
1 0 a lot of people have tried to link you to the ethics problems of the governor there in ohio .                    
0 0 what do you think ?                                                  
0 0 did that have an effect on the race ?                                          
1 0 my opponent tried to malign my character in a very unfair way by painting a very broad brush that anybody that served in the house of representatives suddenly was tied
0 0 it was -- it was a very unfair portrayal of me .                                    
0 0 he did it the last two weeks of the campaign , very little time for me to actually respond to it .                
0 0 again , with the uniqueness of this race , the quickness of this race , allowed him to do a smoke-and-mirrors approach .              
0 0 i would caution anyone on either side to look at this race as a bellwether for the republican party or democratic party , because it was a special race .
0 0 special unique features were going into this that will not be in place in a general election .                        
1 0 jean schmidt , thank you so much .                                            
0 0 we 'll see you up here in washington .                                          
1 0 you bet .                                                      
0 0 thank you so much .                                                  
1 0 the fighting mad senator from west virginia .                                            
0 0 coming up , robert byrd firing back at republicans trying to block his bid to win a ninth term on the hill .              
0 0 the ohio congressional election .                                                  
0 0 our blog reporters are standing by with a look at the online reaction to the surprising results .                        
0 0 and the president 's working vacation , all five weeks of it .                                  
0 0 we 'll get paul begala and vicky clarke 's take on it in our `` strategy session . ''                      
0 0 as we mentioned , a republican won the special congressional election in ohio yesterday , but democrats are celebrating , too .                
0 0 former state lawmaker jean schmidt is headed for capitol hill following her narrow defeat of iraq war veteran paul hackett .                  
0 0 but hackett supporters are kicking up their heels because their man came ever so close to winning in a major republican stronghold .              
0 0 joining me now with his take on this , cnn political analyst stu rothenberg .                              
0 0 stu , thanks for coming in .                                              
1 0 sure , john .                                                    
1 0 why was this so close ?                                                
1 1 well , i think there are a number of reasons .                                      
0 0 hard to identify any single reason , a number of factors .                                    
0 0 one , the republican candidate , jean schmidt , was an accidental nominee .                                
0 0 the only reason she won the republican primary is the top two republicans destroyed each other .                          
0 0 she came through and ended up running a very amateurish campaign .                                    
0 0 she refused to attack hackett , the democrat , did n't make this a liberal-conservative , republican- democratic race , just talked about her personality .        
0 0 not enough .                                                      
0 0 second , the republican situation in ohio is disastrous at the moment .                                  
0 0 governor bob taft 's job approval is 19 percent .                                        
0 0 the state republican party is fending off charges every day -- every day , ethics charges about the administration .                    
0 0 and the democratic congressional campaign committee came in with a terrific ad right at the end linking schmidt and taft .                  
0 0 i think that 's -- those are -- that 's the main reason why the race was so close .                    
1 0 so , is this really a bellwether , though ?                                        
1 1 well , it may be for a bellwether for ohio republicans .                                    
0 0 i 'm -- that is , this is a siren , warning siren , for them .                          
0 0 in terms of president bush and national , the republicans for 2006 , i think we have to be very cautious .                
0 0 taft was such a lightning rod here .                                            
0 0 schmidt ran such a horrendous campaign .                                              
0 0 she really did n't use president bush effectively .                                          
0 0 and , in fact , the democrats did n't make this about bush .                                
0 0 they wanted to make it about the governor .                                          
0 0 so , the president 's national numbers are weak .                                        
0 0 and this could -- certainly , the cycle could develop .                                      
0 0 ethics could be an issue that the democrats use over the whole cycle .                                
0 0 but i think we ca n't read too much about bush into this special election .                            
1 0 want to talk about a couple other senate races for the '06 midterms .                                
0 0 we 're hearing a little bit of news about katherine harris , that race in florida .                          
0 0 what 's going on ?                                                  
1 1 that 's right .                                                    
0 0 well , alan bense , the speaker of the state house , who has been heavily recruited by national republican strategists , the republican senate campaign committee , has announced
0 0 that leaves katherine harris as the 800-pound gorilla in the race .                                    
0 0 one congressman , mark foley , is still mentioned , still says he 's considering .                            
0 0 but , with bense out , it looks like harris is going to be the nominee .                          
0 0 a lot of national republicans have been , let 's say , lukewarm in their enthusiasm about her .                      
0 0 they wonder about her electability .                                                
0 0 that 's been their major concern .                                              
0 0 it 's -- they do n't have any other problems with her .                                  
0 0 they are just not sure she can win .                                          
0 0 but if she becomes the nominee , they 're going to have to get behind her .                          
0 0 florida is a competitive state .                                                
0 0 the republicans ca n't not play in florida .

0 0 senator byrd has n't even made his announcement official yet for reelection .                                  
1 1 right .                                                        
0 1 right .                                                        
0 1 both sides -- both sides are in that race .                                        
0 0 the republican senate committee ran a tv spot talking about how senator byrd had changed , how he was this conservative democrat and now he 's a liberal democrat .
0 0 the byrd people fired back .                                                
0 0 there is a good deal of animosity in this race already , even though the republicans do n't have a top-tier contender .              
0 0 the republicans -- the democrats fired back .                                            
0 0 byrd fired back , talking about outside interests who want to privatize social security , interfering in west virginia politics .                  
0 0 this is a -- it 's a remarkably nasty race .                                      
0 0 and people are very emotionally involved in a number of these contests , whether it 's florida , as we started with , west virginia , or pennsylvania , as
1 0 stu rothenberg , thanks so much .

0 0 a new poll finds new york senator hillary clinton leading a potential gop challenger by a wide margin .                      
0 0 the quinnipiac university survey gives clinton a 34-point lead over westchester county district attorney jeanine pirro .                          
0 0 word of clinton 's lead comes as pirro continues to consider campaigns for governor or state attorney general , as well as the 2006 senate race .      
0 0 a spokesman today denied a report that pirro had ruled out a senate campaign .                              
0 0 west virginia 's longtime democratic senator robert byrd is firing back at republicans with a new tv ad in his home state .              
0 0 the ad defends byrd against what it calls out-of-state special interests that are running -- quote -- `` false attack ads . ''              
0 0 a spot paid for by the national republican senatorial committee that started airing in west virginia last week criticizes byrd as out of touch with the state 's voters .
0 0 republicans are aggressively recruiting a candidate to challenge his attempt to win a ninth senate term .                          
0 0 and detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick came in second among a dozen candidates yesterday in his bid for reelection .                      
0 0 he now faces a november 8 runoff against freman hendrix , the city 's former deputy mayor , who was the top vote-getter in yesterday 's primary .    
0 0 and billionaire financier political activist george soros has apparently decided to pull the plug on america coming together .                      
0 0 that 's the group that soros poured tens of millions of dollars into last year as part of his effort to defeat president bush .          
0 0 the `` washington post '' reports the group has notified its employees that their august paychecks will be their last .                  
0 0 the blogosphere phenomenon appears to be growing by leaps and bounds , but is it ?                            
0 0 up next , our blog reporters with all the details of the state of the blogosphere report .                        
0 0 there 's a new development in the baseball steroid scandal .                                      
0 0 the top two representatives of the house government reform committee are calling on major league baseball to turn all documents over relating to the positive tests of baltimore orioles star
0 0 on monday , baseball officials announced that palmeiro was being suspended for 10 days for using steroids .                        
0 0 palmeiro testified in march to the committee that he had never used steroids .                                
0 0 making false statements to congress is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison .                          
0 0 in a statement , palmeiro said he will cooperate fully with the committee and release any information needed .                      
0 0 as we mentioned , the results of the special congressional election in ohio was full of surprises .

1 1 hi , joe .                                                    
0 0 well , as we heard earlier on the show , paul hackett did lose , but the progressive blogs online are celebrating a victory .          
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 0 well , he got 48 percent of the vote in a heavily republican district .                              
0 0 that is a big deal .                                                
0 0 they 're saying this is an omen of things to come in 2006 and elections down the line .                      
0 0 over at offthekuff , this is charles kuffner , who is a consultant at a multinational firm .                        
0 0 he blogs at offthekuff.com .                                                  
0 0 he says here are his final thoughts , that hackett definitely beat the spread .                              
0 0 he says the positive media surrounding this election , it validates the run- everywhere concept the dems will be pushing .                  
0 0 he says it shows the power of the netroots fund-raising effort .                                    
0 0 we talked about that extensively here yesterday .                                            
0 0 and also , he says making the republicans drop half-a-million dollars on a race that was supposed to be just a formality , not a bad thing .    
1 0 so , a lot of celebration and excitement in the progressive blogs that have really followed this race today .                    
0 0 and there 's also some looking forward to hackett 's future .                                    
0 0 jerome armstrong at www.mydd.com , these guys had really followed this race .                                  
0 0 they 're hoping that -- they 're saying that the battle for ohio has now been engaged , hoping that hackett will run for governor or maybe a senate seat
0 0 lots of fingers crossed for him there .                                            
0 0 over on the right , there 's a little bit of gloating , though , it that has to be said .                
0 0 redstate.org , yesterday , they were pointing out that so much online money had been raised by bloggers , pointing out that that was extraordinary .        
0 0 but , today , they 're saying , well , it still did n't get you very far , did it ?                
0 0 he did n't win and also all the candidates that the daily kos people backed last year did n't win , saying not so fast , a little bit too
0 1 interesting , though , also at redstate , someone else is posting about ohio and this -- the ohio gop needs to wake up now , pointing out that there
1 0 also , some lessons to be learned over on the progressive blogs .                                  
0 0 we 've got nathannewman.org .                                                  
0 0 he 's a lawyer and a writer .                                            
0 0 and he has got a big post saying , still need a message .                                
0 0 he says the democrats need a strong united message that their candidates can run on .                            
0 0 he says they also have to be just as solid in pushing that message as they have been in attacking gop policies .              
0 0 another progressive who is weighing in , in terms of lessons learned is steve gilliard .                            
0 0 this is stevegilliard.blogspot.com .                                                    
0 0 he points out that the grassroots effort on the ground and the online netroots effort work side by side , but there was no integration , and that is something
0 0 so , the blogs continuing to grow , that being the huge story , is the impact that they had in this election .            
1 0 so , growing in influence in politics .                                            
0 0 but also , there 's a report out this week suggesting that they 're growing at an extraordinary pace in terms of sheer number .          
0 0 david sifry is the ceo and the founder of technorati.com , an online site that tracks web logs as they appear , looks for stories in them .    
0 0 he 's got a state of the blogosphere report that 's come out this week .                            
0 0 he did one earlier this year .                                              
0 0 when he did his last report , there were eight million blogs out there .                              
0 0 now he says there are over 40 million .                                          
0 0 the size of the blogosphere has doubled in five months .                                      
0 0 he says that a blog is being created every second .                                      
0 0 now , many bloggers are pointing out , linking to this , saying not so fast .                          
0 0 these numbers seem a little bit inflated .                                            
0 0 some of these are spam blogs , not hosted by a real person .                                
0 0 also , some of them are blogs that are created once and never updated , like this one here .                    
1 0 sifry updates again today with his second installment of the state of the blogosphere , this one about posts .

    that translates to 10.4 posts a second .                                            
    he also has this wonderful chart that shows how posts and search volume spikes with major worldwide news events .                    
    he says these numbers continue to grow .

0 0 i think so .                                                    
0 0 if you look at senator mccain , a republican in the senate who 's probably the chief supporter of the war in either party , he 's seen as the
0 0 people respect him and admire him ; some agree , some disagree .                                  
0 0 the president , however , has a credibility problem that mccain does n't have .                              
0 0 they have the same substantive position , but completely different views of credibility .                                
0 0 why ?                                                        
0 0 well , in part , now a majority of americans in a gallup poll , 51 percent , say the president misled us going into the war .    
0 0 and since then , i think the president has calibrated too far over to the happy-talk side of things and not as far to sort of the mccain side of
0 0 that 's a message that even opponents who are like me , i think , could rally to .                      
1 0 but i think the president has -- at least has given the public a sense that he 's not leveling with us .              
0 0 and when a politician loses his credibility , he loses everything .                                    
1 0 now , the president is certainly trying to stay on message , at least right now .                          
0 0 we have a little sound clip of his message on iraq .                                    
0 0 the violence in recent days in iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face .                          
0 0 these terrorists and insurgents will use brutal tactics because they 're trying to shake the will of the united states of america .              
0 0 that 's what they 're trying to do .                                          
0 0 they want us to retreat .                                                
0 0 they want us , in our compassion for the innocent , say we 're through .                            
1 0 that 's what they want .                                                
1 1 they will fail .                                                    
0 0 here at home -- you wanted to say something ?                                        
0 0 no .                                                        
0 0 i just disagree slightly with paul and his characterization of the president -- being , to say something is a grim reminder of the brutality of these people , that
0 0 and when there is a bad patch , the president has been out there more than previous commanders-in-chief in tough times like this .            
0 0 so , i give him credit for trying to be as straight as possible .                              
0 0 of course , he has to be positive and optimistic about the ultimate outcome .                              
0 0 he absolutely has to be .                                                
1 1 it 's a tough , tough job and it is easy to sit somewhere else and criticize and talk about all the bad things that are happening .    
0 0 it 's harder to be the one that leads the strategy and the plan all the way through .                      
1 0 yes .                                                        
1 0 but how do you explain that mccain is so trusted and the president so distrusted when they have the same position ?                
0 0 i just think it is far easier to be on the outside talking and criticizing about what 's going on , than being the ones on the inside , making
0 0 let 's talk a little bit about this ohio race that 's been one of the themes of our show .                  
0 0 you had jean schmidt and hackett running head-to-head there in a very close race .                              
0 0 the republican ends up winning , but it was a much closer race than expected .                            
1 0 and a lot of people say it was all about iraq .                                    
0 0 is this , to either of you , a sign of things to come with the midterms down the road ?                  
0 0 well , it was about iraq and corruption .                                          
0 0 the governor of ohio , bob taft , is desperately unpopular .                                    
0 0 he 's got a real corruption scandal .                                            
0 0 democrats see both of those issues perhaps playing to their favor in '06 , when you have corruption problems in washington with the republican party -- tom delay , karl
0 0 so democrats see this as a sign that the country is turning away .                                
0 0 when the president ran in that same district just a few months ago , he got 64 percent .                      
0 0 when you drop from 64 percent to 52 , that 's a collapse .                                
0 0 and the democrats believe that a guy like major hackett , who 's a marine major , is in a good position to offer a critique of the war ,
0 0 so he 's not being disloyal .                                              
1 0 he is saying essentially , no , we should not cut and run , but no , we were n't told the truth going in either .      
0 0 and that seemed to be a pretty powerful message in a very republican district .                              
0 0 i think it 's too soon to say if that 's going to -- and it certainly wo n't be the way it will be across the country next year
0 0 every district will be different .                                                
0 0 in some places , iraq is going to have a more prominent role than others .                            
0 0 it depends on what 's going on with the economy .                                      
1 0 it depends on other issues .                                                
0 1 i think it 's too soon to say , boy , this is it for the democrats next year .                    
1 1 there was a lot of really tough language in this race and hackett , as a matter of fact , was responsible for some of it .      
1 0 do you think that turns voters off in ohio ...                                        
1 1 no .                                                        
0 0 .. and the midwest ?                                                  
0 0 no .                                                        
0 0 he went -- look , no democrat has gotten better than 37 percent in that district .                          
0 0 major hackett goes out there and calls president bush an s.o.b. , calls him a chicken-hawk .                          
0 0 in a debate he 's asked , what 's the greatest threat to american national security ?                          
0 0 he says , that guy sitting in the white house .                                      
0 0 now , beware my fellow democrats .                                              
1 0 you can probably only get away with talking like a marine , if you are a marine , ok ?                    
0 0 if you 're a guy like me who never finished the boy scouts and you talk that way , people are going to hate you .        
1 0 no .                                                        
0 0 i agree completely .                                                    
0 0 all right .                                                      
0 0 we 'll take a break and come right back .                                        
0 0 president bush takes a long working vacation , but the white house says it 's not just r and r. straight ahead , we 'll focus on mr. bush 's
0 0 stay with us .                                                    
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues right after this .                                        
0 0 the `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics .                                        
0 0 with me today , democratic strategist paul begala and former pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke .                              
0 0 president bush is spending time away from the white house ; 33 days , to be exact .                        
0 0 during his stay at his ranch in crawford , texas , mr. bush will surpass ronald reagan 's record for time away from washington .          
1 0 and while democrats needle the president about his time off , the white house insists mr. bush is taking care of the affairs of state .        
0 0 on today 's agenda , a trip to grapevine , texas , for a speech touting some of mr. bush 's accomplishments including economic growth .        
1 0 you know , we went through a recession and a stock market correction and a terrorist attack and corporate scandals and war .              
1 0 and in spite of that , this economy is growing at some of the highest levels ever .                        
0 0 so , it good strategy for the president to be away on this vacation right now ?                          
0 0 the word vacation should n't be used .                                            
0 0 look , i go on vacation .                                              
0 0 i swim with my kids on vacation .                                            
0 0 i take them out in boats .                                              
0 0 we go fishing .                                                    
0 0 he goes on vacation , he 's meeting with heads of state .                                  
0 0 he 's having vtcs with his military leaders .                                          
0 0 he 's going out and giving speeches once or twice a week .                                  
1 0 he 's talking about the remarkable accomplishments of his administration thus far .                                  
0 0 that 's a pretty tough vacation .                                              
0 0 i love it .                                                    
0 0 it 's like -- they come to him at some point and say , mr. president , you 're an all-time low in the polls .        
0 0 the majority of americans now do n't trust you .                                        
0 0 your chief foreign enterprise , iraq , is not going well .                                    
0 0 your chief domestic enterprise , social security privatization , is dead .                                    
0 0 your chief aide is spending half his life in front of the grand jury .                              
0 1 and he says road trip .                                                
0 0 and i 'm going to endorse that .                                            
0 0 no .                                                        
0 0 tory 's right .                                                    
0 0 no president is ever truly on vacation .                                            
0 0 and i think democrats are wrong to attack him for this .                                    
0 0 i whole-heartedly endorse the president going on vacation .                                          
0 0 and i think democrats , instead of attacking him for going , should say , look at that speech .                    
1 0 he says the economy is great .                                              
0 0 he can be just as out of touch in texas as he is in the oval office .                        
1 0 if being out of touch is having low -- 5 percent unemployment , lowest it 's been since 9/11 , lowest average of the last three decades , having the
0 0 and i promise you , those american people with whom the democrats are trying to score some cheap shots , are going to see a heck of a lot more
0 0 but that 's part of the peril .                                            
0 0 when president clinton used to go on vacation , he would actually just go and hide in martha 's vineyard .                  
0 0 we 'd make him .                                                  
1 0 he hated doing it .                                                  
0 0 he would go up .                                                  
0 0 he hated doing it ?                                                  
1 0 he 's not that good an actor .                                            
0 0 i do n't think he hated doing it .                                          
0 0 president bush , i actually think would do well to dial back his public presence .                            
0 0 right now , the american people are annoyed with him .                                      
0 0 mostly they 've liked him .                                                
0 0 but right now they are annoyed with him .                                          
1 0 and if i were advising him , quite honestly , i 'd say go and hide in crawford for a few days or a few weeks .      
0 0 do n't run out to grapevine , texas , and give speeches .                                  
0 0 he 's got a great story to tell on the domestic front .                                  
0 0 he 's got a tough story to tell , but he 's got to do it , on the national security front .              
1 0 he is the best messenger of that .                                            
0 0 and he 's got to be out there , because if he just leaves a vacuum to those who want to say oh my god , where 's the president
0 0 no .                                                        
0 0 i 'll defend myself .                                                  
0 0 for five years , every summer , i have endorsed and embraced the president 's vacations .                          
0 0 he deserves a break .                                                  
0 0 the country deserves a break from him , too .                                        
1 0 but i think it 's good .                                              
0 0 and i 'll continue to say it 's good .                                        
0 0 so , one thing , you mentioned karl rove , though .                                    
0 0 he does put some distance between himself and that , for instance , right ?                              
1 0 he goes out to texas .                                                
0 0 he 's got the reporters all gathered round to see his one movement or if he goes out to , you know , chop some wood or whatever he does
0 0 i think what 's putting the distance between the news coverage and karl rove is there 's nothing significant happening .                  
0 0 and there has n't been for some time until the end of this investigation and we hear from fitzgerald .                    
0 0 i think that 's why you 're not seeing that .                                      
1 0 but he 's going to be focused on things that are important to people in this country , including the economy , including jobs , those sorts of things .
0 0 those are important things to be focused on .                                          
1 0 and chain sawing cedar trees in bosci county , that 's fine .                                  
1 1 wherever it is .                                                    
0 0 and coming back , too , it 's is going to be a very busy season here with the roberts nomination and a whole variety of other things , it
0 0 right .                                                        
0 0 and i think one of the reasons , you start looking at these major pieces of legislation that have passed -- the trade legislation , et cetera -- one of
0 0 it 's fine to belittle the president .

0 0 and they 're starting to feel some pressure too , as they should , for results .                          
0 0 the sense and the direction of the country in all of the pollings that we 're going desperately off in the wrong direction .

0 0 he 's in bad shape for a second term president .                                      
1 0 is he doing the right thing , strategy-wise , by sticking to his guns on the veto threat on stem cell ?                
0 0 i mean , now you have bill frist getting behind embryonic stem cell research , and at least the senate is sending strong indications that the white house is n't
0 0 i do n't think he has any choice .                                          
1 0 he has staked his position on a very controversial issue , even with his own party .                          
0 0 it is so emotional , it 's so hot , i do n't think he has any room to do anything but that .            
0 0 i think torie 's right .                                                
0 0 you ca n't budge .                                                  
0 0 as it is , he gets some static from both sides for his position , which seems to be stem cell research is wrong , it 's the taking of
1 0 if he added any more nuance to it , or changed position at all , he 'd be through .                    
0 0 he 's got to stick with his pledge , veto the bill and just be unpopular for it .                      
0 0 all right .

1 0 still to come , roberts spells out his view of the job in a reply to senate questions .                      
0 0 that 's our focus when the `` strategy session '' continues .                                    
0 0 i 'm wolf blitzer in washington .                                              
0 0 coming up at the top of the hour , a bloody day for u.s. troops in iraq .                        
0 0 fourteen united states marines killed by a roadside bomb .                                        
0 0 six killed earlier in the week .                                              
0 0 we 'll have president bush 's reaction .                                            
0 0 everyone got out of this burning airliner safely , but what caused the fire in the first place ?                      
0 0 we 'll have the latest on the investigation .                                          
0 0 and 19 years in prison for a crime he did not commit .                                  
0 0 now he 's free .                                                  
0 0 and we 'll talk with thomas doswell .                                            
1 0 all those stories , much more , only minutes away on wolf blitzer reports .                              
0 0 now back to inside politics .                                                
1 0 `` strategy session '' continues on inside politics .                                          
1 0 still here , democratic strategist paul begala and former pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke .                                
0 0 ca n't get rid of us .                                              
0 0 sorry .                                                        
0 0 what i think we want to talk about now is john roberts and his views of the job .                      
0 0 in a reply to senate questions , roberts says among other things he would respect legal precedence .                        
1 0 those comments released today by the senate judiciary committee .                                        
0 0 and in texas , president bush had these words for senators as they prepare for roberts ' confirmation hearings .                    
0 0 they must be deliberate .                                                  
1 0 but they also must hear this cause .                                            
0 0 roberts needs to get his hearing done , and the confirmation completed so he can be seated before the supreme court reconvenes in early october .        
1 0 so what does it tell you when roberts , in this writing that goes to the united states senate , talks about the importance of precedent ?      
0 0 are we hearing code here about roe versus wade ?                                        
0 0 you know , people on the far left and far right , some of the special interest groups , will be very into the code talking .      
0 0 i think the surprise here , every day we learn more about him , is not many surprises .                      
0 0 he 's very smart , very articulate , has a strict interpretation of what the constitution intended , a great deal of respect for the roles and responsibilities for the
1 0 if you want to honestly say , ok , i 'm learning about his philosophy , i 'm learning how he looks at government and those sorts of things ,
0 0 if you want to find those secret messages about specific cases , you 're making it up if you think you found it .            
0 0 i 've been -- one trick pony on this .                                        
0 0 why not tell us ?                                                  
1 0 why do we need a secret decoder ring ?                                          
1 0 why ca n't we ask him a legitimate question ?                                        
0 0 what would everybody in town talk about ?                                            
0 0 i know .                                                      
0 0 but he should ask -- i think senators should ask him not about this case percolating up through the courts that he might have to rule on , but ask
1 0 some people believe the constitution requires a right to abortion , others think it does n't .                          
0 0 those are important issues .                                                  
0 0 but thousands and thousands and thousands -- i think it 's literally in the hundreds of thousands -- of pages now of documentation have been turned over so people prior
0 0 voluminous -- amazing what you can learn from those .                                        
0 0 and then i think what is going on now is those democratic senators who want to make this as controversial as possible , are trying to find ways to frame
1 0 and again , i go back to my one-trick pony , and this is the ginsberg strategy .                        
0 0 he has to do what ruth bader ginsberg said , some questions are appropriate to answer and some are n't .                  
0 0 but the problem with that is justice ginsberg when she was judge ginsberg was asked straight up , do you believe there 's a constitutional right for abortion by hank
0 0 she said , yes .                                                  
0 0 in fact , she went on to say without the right to have an abortion , a woman is not a fully adult human being .        
0 0 now that 's a pretty strong statement .                                            
0 0 she said that in her confirmation hearings .                                            
0 0 and you know what ?                                                  
0 0 the world did n't end .                                                
0 0 she told us that you have to have an abortion right .                                    
1 0 and i believe this judge does n't think there 's a right .                                  
1 0 and he should just say so .                                              
1 0 and there are plenty of incidents -- questions where she said , not appropriate .                              
1 0 and that was wrong for her .                                              
0 0 that would be expressing an opinion that might come before me .                                    
1 0 another thing that came out of these filings is how much money he 's worth , john roberts , something like $ 5.3 million .          
1 0 he made a lot of money out there as a lawyer here in town , in fact .                        
0 0 and i would be willing to bet every case and issue he worked on that in that law firm we 'll probably hear about between now and then .  
0 0 i 'm sure you will .                                                
0 0 but do you think the issue of his tax returns might come up ?                                
1 0 and is that going to have a bearing at all ?                                      
0 0 is this something that is fair game for a supreme court justice ?                                  
0 0 you can get into discussions about what 's fair game and what 's not .                              
0 0 but the reality is , people will ask and challenge almost everything .                                  
0 0 that 's just the reality of the way this town operates .                                    
0 0 now , i do n't think it 's right .                                        
0 0 i think it 's one of the reasons it 's getting harder and harder to get good people to go into public service .            
1 0 but it 's reality .                                                  
0 0 and i 'm sure he 's prepared for it .                                        
0 0 and i do n't think it 's getting harder to get good people to go into public service .                      
1 0 and he should have to disclose his tax returns : not his personal life , not his personal life , not his video rentals as some people tried to get
1 1 but his financial disclosure should be absolute and complete and should include tax returns just like every congressman and senator practically does .              
0 0 but , you know , now that you 've said that , i would be willing to bet in a few weeks , there 's going to be a style
0 1 all right .                                                      
0 0 thank you both .                                                    
1 0 victoria clarke , paul begala , appreciate you coming in .                                      
0 0 it 's been a good talk .                                              
1 0 you , too .

0 0 well , joe , bloggers are certainly mourning the death of one of their own today .                          
0 0 steven vincent , the journalist murdered in iraq , was well known and well read in the online journalism community .                  
0 0 he was a frequent contributor to the `` national review online . ''

1 0 she calls steven vincent `` freedom 's reporter . ''                                        
0 0 now , steven vincent himself also had a blog .                                        
0 0 that blog is `` in the red zone '' at expensepublishing.typepad.com .                                    
0 0 if you look at it today , there is a simple tribute there .                                
0 0 but you can scroll back for months and months of reports from in and around basra where he was reporting from .                
0 0 one of his reports was published in the `` new york times '' op ed section over the weekend when he was looking at the tight grip that shiite groups
0 0 he was sharply critical of some of those groups .                                        
0 0 also , in a recent post , `` the naive american '' he echoed some of those thoughts .                      
0 0 it was this kind of reporting that had bloggers all around the world linking to him .

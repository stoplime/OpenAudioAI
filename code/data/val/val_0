this is cnn breaking news. %$* 1
good morning. %$* 0
and welcome to reliable sources. %$* 0
i'm brian stelter, live in new york. %$* 0
and we are standing by for any new developments on the assassination of these two new york city police officers. %$* 0
my heart is aching for my city this morning. %$* 0
and we will keep you fully informed on this throughout the day here on cnn. %$* 0
we also have breaking news about another major and fast-moving story. %$* 0
that is the sony pictures cyber attack. %$* 0
it is an attack the u.s. now believes was instigated by north korea. %$* 0
in an interview on cnn's "state of the union" this morning, president obama told candy crowley that it was an act of cyber vandalism, a very costly one at that, and he said the u.s. will respond proportionally. %$* 0
now, as we come to air this morning, there is a new statement from the north korean regime. %$* 0
a regime that keeps denying it's behind the hacking, but a regime that keeps threatening the united states and keeps condemning the movie "the interview." %$* 0
yes, "the interview". %$* 0
can you believe we are talking cyber attacks and threats because of a seth rogen movie? %$* 0
this really is an extraordinary moment. %$* 0
what was thought of as a silly, maybe lousy comedy just a few weeks ago has now become a symbol of two of america's greatest values, freedom of expression, and freedom from fear. %$* 0
i want to say that one again. %$* 0
freedom from fear. %$* 0
this affects every movie studio, every media company, really every news organization in the digital age. %$* 0
in fact, president obama said that this morning and we're going to play that sound bite just ahead. %$* 0
so, i have a group of guests standing by this morning covering this from every angle. %$* 0
we've got mark cuban, larry king, alan dershowitz and many more. %$* 0
we need to begin with this new threat from north korea, because it was published in english earlier this morning, and i'm going to read a bit of it to you now. %$* 0
it says, "the dprk has clear evidence that the u.s. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie." %$* 0
they're talking about "the interview." %$* 0
it goes on to say later, "the army and people of the dprk is fully ready to stand in confrontation with the u.s. in all war spaces, including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels." %$* 0
this is a long statement that was published. %$* 0
so, let's go straight to kyung lah, cnn's correspondent in seoul, south korea. %$* 0
you're up late with this and thank you for being here. %$* 0
when you read this statement, what were the big takeaways to you? %$* 1
oh, i thought that the usual writer for the dprk has finally come back from vacation because we're seeing that bellicose, saber-rattling, this typical rhetoric from north korea. %$* 0
they are upping the ante. %$* 0
it is just like the rhetoric we hear whenever north korea attacks, whenever they lash out, and they are at their very best here. %$* 0
a couple things to note: it did come out in english, brian. %$* 0
you're right about that. %$* 0
it came out a couple hours ago, late here in korea. %$* 0
the audience is absolutely not the domestic audience. %$* 0
it is for america. %$* 0
it came from the national defense commission. %$* 0
this is essentially the agency that as far as we know runs the military, the pentagon, if you will, speaking directly for kim jong-un. %$* 0
and the other thing i really note about this is that they are trying to up the ante. %$* 0
north korea craves attention, and they are saying, ok, everyone is concerned about cyberattacks, so we're going to make it worse. %$* 1
so, when you read this, we were on air together yesterday, and you called one of the threats from north korea ridiculous. %$* 0
you know, they were coming out yesterday talking about this film. %$* 0
what's different between what we heard yesterday and what we're now hearing this morning? %$* 1
it's even more ridiculous. %$* 0
i mean, they say that they're going to wage war against the white house, the pentagon, the u.s. mainland. %$* 0
i mean, it is typical north korea language, but at the same time we have to remember this is a brutal regime. %$* 0
what they say you have to take with some sort of seriousness, and the fact that they have been so successful with sony pictures, you know, how much of this rhetoric can they actually achieve? %$* 0
so, there is this crazy over-the-top language they throw out there, but there is some seriousness. %$* 0
we have to take that away from that. %$* 1
to your point, reading this long statement, at one point it says "the interview" is a movie that's undesirable and it justifies and incites terrorism. %$* 0
it should not be allowed in any country in any region. %$* 0
as i read this news statement, kyung, i thought to myself, it sounds a lot like what this anonymous group of hackers said on thursday. %$* 0
you know, on thursday night, they sent a threatening e-mail to the heads of the sony studio basically saying, you did the right thing by cutting the movie "the interview" out of theaters. %$* 0
you did the right thing, and as long as you never release the movie, we will stop attacking you. %$* 0
this sounds somewhat similar, does it not? %$* 1
yes, the same ghostwriter. %$* 0
it's like someone who continues to smoke and smells like cigarette smoke but pledges they kicked the habit. %$* 0
i mean, north korea simply is trying to say that they don't know who they are but, oh, we really love what they have done. %$* 0
so, yes, you're absolutely right. %$* 1
it occurs to me this is the kind of statement, the kind of rhetoric, that causes people like seth rogen to want to make a movie making fun of kim jong-un. %$* 0
let me ask you one more thing, because i think it's important that north korea is claiming the administration was involved in the making of the movie. %$* 0
i wanted to play a sound bite from fareed zakaria's interview with michael lynton, the head of sony pictures, where they talked about how all of this started because it was back in june when north korea actually first condemned the movie. %$* 0
it was six months before it was supposed to be released. %$* 0
here is what michael lynton said. %$* 1
michael, let me ask you to go through the sequence of what happened. %$* 0
when did you first realize that you had a problem? %$* 1

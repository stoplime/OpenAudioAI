welcome back. %$* 53
republicans, maybe with some secret information about lebron, decided this past week to hold their 2016 nominating convention in cleveland. %$* 53
they hope it will help put ohio back in the gop column come 2016. %$* 53
as we wait for the democrats to make their choice, we thought good use of our puzzle this week, is take a little tour through history to see whether your convention location really affects the election. %$* 53
let's go back to 199s, george and barbara bush in their hometown %$* 53
of houston, well, they won texas but they didn't win the election. %$* 53
bill clinton and al gore chose new york, madison square garden. %$* 53
they did win the election but new york was a foregone conclusion. %$* 53
it's always blue. %$* 53
the timing helped there, that's when ross perot was getting out of the race. %$* 53
let's come forward to 2008, you betcha, the republicans thought going to minnesota might help them in the rust belt but it didn't. %$* 53
minnesota was reliably blue again in november. %$* 53
team obama will tell you this, they believe that going to colorado in 2008 did help put that state in the democratic fold because it voted for bush in 2004. %$* 53
fast forward to 2012, as you know, barack obama went to north carolina. %$* 53
he won it in 2008 but not in 2012 so that didn't work. %$* 53
the republicans knew they needed florida, they went to tampa, nope, that one went blue. %$* 53
so as you see, it doesn't always matter where you hold your convention. %$* 53
why then would republicans go to cleveland, ohio? %$* 53
maybe you know the history. %$* 53
no republican in modern times has won the presidency without winning ohio. %$* 53
this was the map in 2012 when barack obama won it for the second consecutive time. %$* 53
a little bit of telestration, what the republicans hope for in 2016 is if they're in cleveland, better turn that on to make it work, they're standing in the suburbs will go up a little bit more. %$* 53
they won them last time but not by the numbers they needed. %$* 53
see this blue here and see this blue here, if i turn this off, what they're hoping for is -- what they're hoping for is that it looks more like this, if they show up in ohio that's george w. bush in 2004, the last time republicans carried that critical state. %$* 53
so robert costa, here's my question as we start the conversation. %$* 53
the guy who would like to be celebrated in cleveland is rick perry. %$* 53
he's among the republicans seeking the nomination. %$* 53
he did seize the national platform this week to get in a fight with the president on immigration. %$* 53
what did we learn about rick perry at this time of crisis? %$* 53
well, i think we see rick perry trying to rehabilitate his political career and i think he's become a different politician since his failed run in 2012. %$* 178
we see he's a little more easygoing. %$* 178
he's more willing to engage with the president directly, a lot of national republicans will not do that. %$* 178
and i think perry is one of the players who is under the radar but someone to be taken seriously. %$* 178
a harder tonation on the surface but we don't know is will rick perry on the debate stage in 2016 change his views from 2012? %$* 53
remember he was for a texas version of the dream act. %$* 53
he was for in- state tuition i believe for some undocumented. %$* 53
will he go to the right on those issues or just on his tone? %$* 53
well, back then, you know, he said you have to have a heart when it comes to immigration and now, you know, it looks like for him to make a play in the primaries he's thinking now he has to be maybe a little tougher on immigration, you know. %$* 250
and it works for him now -- that borders is what he knows and so now the president is being pitted against him and makes him look good. %$* 250
is it olivier is it just a moment in time or are we seeing rick perry use this to become a serious player? %$* 53
well, i apologize in advance, time will tell. %$* 185
no, i mean that is really the question. %$* 185
he looked pretty promising speaking in the previous cycle. %$* 185
he gave a couple of great speeches to some conservative groups. %$* 185
he looked like possibly the front-runner if you walked in, you know, governor of a big, important state with an interesting economic record and then he fizzles. %$* 185
and so we're facing sort of that same question with him this time. %$* 185
although clearly the border issue is much more relevant to the governor of texas running for president than some of the others. %$* 185
but if he goes hard right molly and abandons his support for in-state tuition for example, something like the dream act allowing the younger undocumented who had no idea a parent or relative was bringing them across the border to allow them to stay and give them some path to status. %$* 53
if he abandons that, can he win in november? %$* 53
if he were going to be the nominee? %$* 53
can republicans win in 2016 if they have the same hard line on immigration that they had when they lost two-thirds of the latino vote in 2012 and 2008? %$* 53
rick perry knows as well as anyone and probably better how bad the long-term politics of a hard line on immigration are for republicans. %$* 253
it's very interesting if you just look at the way the sort of texas republican party has moved away from rick perry. %$* 253
rick perry, who you know, when he entered the 2012 race remember the rap on him was he was this crazy anti-washington tea party right winger and yet he has this moderate position on immigration. %$* 253
the texas republican party in its platform had a moderate position on immigration but this year we have seen the new lieutenant governor nominee in texas and all the way down the slate of the republicans who are now in power in texas are much more hard line. %$* 253
the party has moved way to the right and that's going back to the convention part of the reason that the national republican party does not now want to be associated with the brand of the texas gop is because they have now taken this very hard edge stand on immigration. %$* 253
so you know, i think rick perry has made a very smart, sort of political opportunistic move on this particular issue because there's such a vacuum. %$* 253
nobody wants to stand next to the pictures coming out of the border -- not president obama and really not any republicans. %$* 253
and so this is an issue that rick perry can own and try to get himself taken seriously again. %$* 253
to that point a lot of republicans won't even stand in a picture with president obama even if they're disagreeing him. %$* 53
but rick perry decided to do that and i'm a huge fan. %$* 53
the president comes to your state i think you should respect the office whether he's a democrat or republican. %$* 53
but rick perry took that stand. %$* 53
he met with the president this week. %$* 53
you see him there, he took the risk maybe. %$* 53
but what did we learn about the president? %$* 53
republicans all week long and then even some democrats said mr.  president, you should go to the border. %$* 53
you're going to be in texas, you have to go to the border. %$* 53
the president said i'm not going. %$* 53
you're not going to bait me into it. %$* 53
this isn't a game. %$* 53
this isn't theater. %$* 40
this is a problem. %$* 40
i'm not interested in photo-ops. %$* 40
i'm interested in solving the problem. %$* 40
he does a fair share like any politicians, olivier. %$* 53
he does a fair share of photo-ops when he thinks it suits his purposes. %$* 53
so what's behind the -- %$* 53
it's absolutely a tool of presidential communications but you know, my reporting indicates that he was particularly interested in avoiding one kind of photo-op. %$* 185
i talked to a congressional democrat who is fairly close to the white house who said, imagine this. %$* 185
he goes to one of the facilities with these teenagers, with these kids who are coming across the border and the images that go back to central and south america are if you send your kid illegally to the united states, the president himself will welcome you here. %$* 185
this person said i don't have a lock on what the white house was thinking but that's certainly part of the problem here. %$* 185
the republicans say stupid not to go, not leadership not to go. %$* 53
if that's the case, then it might be smart not to go. %$* 53
perhaps but i think the president at some point probably is going to have to get down there. %$* 178
this is a national controversy and it's looming over his presidency. %$* 178
and he may want to avoid political theater and he may for a long time be able to put the blame on republicans but eventually this comes down to him and speaker boehner. %$* 178
who's going to get there and who's going to have the solution. %$* 178
rick perry tried to connect it to his katrina -- right. %$* 250
so then you have the images that george bush had that didn't look so good and with obama down at the border, would that be that for him? %$* 250
have we learned anything about the president? %$* 53
one knock on him is he doesn't have these relationships to bring people together at a moment like this. %$* 53
i'm not saying all the blame is his. %$* 53
i think they all share the blame. %$* 53
they all share the blame. %$* 53
but is there something missing from -- it's mostly speech giving, it's not deal making. %$* 53
you know, the message has already gotten down to guatemala and honduras that if you get here we'll take care of you because it's true. %$* 155
because we aren't going to let the kids starve to death in the streets, this is america. %$* 155
and so what i think we have learned is that this is a white house especially in the second term that is not particularly receptive to outside pressure, wherever it comes from, whether it's from their own allies, whether it's from their opponents. %$* 155
they have chosen their course. %$* 155
they're going to stick to it and they decreasingly feel that anyone else ought to be telling them what to do. %$* 155
we'll see if they stick to that and the week ahead as they start to negotiate some of this. %$* 53
everybody stay put. %$* 53
up next, tomorrow's news today as our reporters help give you a head start on the big political news just around the corner. %$* 53
let's go around the table and ask our great reporters to share some reporting and get you out ahead of the curve. %$* 53
molly ball? %$* 53
well, this may finally be the week that we learn what the administration is going to do with the long-awaited nondiscrimination executive order that was promised several weeks ago and then delayed when this controversy erupted after the hobby lobby decision about the tension between religious liberty and in this case gay rights. %$* 155
of course, in hobby lobby it was about contraception but this has really set the administration back on its heels. %$* 155
they didn't expect there to be such a difficult decision between the gay rights groups calling for there not to be religious exemption in this order and the religious groups saying that there has to be religious exemption in this order. %$* 155
big test for the president. %$* 53
we'll watch that. %$* 53
olivier? %$* 53
let's say the heavens open up and our elected leaders see the light and they agree on this short term $4 billion measure for the border, just say that. %$* 185
the problem is not going away any time soon. %$* 185
the latest figures for immigration court are pretty startling -- a backlog of about 375,000 claims, and the average wait time, if you're in the system, before you see an immigration judge is 587 days. %$* 185
it gives you a sense of the severity of the policy problem. %$* 185
we like to relate things back to politics a lot -- to 2014, to 2016 -- that's natural but that gives you a sense of how long this problem has been neglected and how long it's going to be with us. %$* 185
that's a stunning number. %$* 53
adrian? %$* 53
if you thought this week was interesting, i mean i think next week is going to be about the kids, about the stories of the children. %$* 250
so you know, you already saw that with the "new york times" went down there -- went down to central america. %$* 250
why are these people actually leaving? %$* 250
i've been reaching out to different organizations because i think there's -- the debate is easy when it's about murrieta, california and there's two sides. %$* 250
there's protesters and that's an easy story for the media. %$* 250
but there's been a lot of like this quick jump at the political narrative and just forgetting that there's children now at the border. %$* 250
not everybody is against them. %$* 250
not everyone is just saying get them out of here. %$* 250
there's people that are trying to help them. %$* 250
i reached out to one organization, united we dream, which did a vigil at the border and they went to a bus station where they're helping out some of the kids. %$* 250
i have them sending me some photos and some other groups along the border to do like a photo story so you can see what the kids look like. %$* 250
it will be interesting to see more of the faces which are missing from this debate, especially right there at the border, whether it will change the political debate. %$* 53
that's interesting. %$* 53
robert. %$* 53
one of the more memorable images in presidential campaign history was when bobby kennedy went to west virginia in the 1968 primary. %$* 178
it's always been a state -- west virginia -- for democrats to go in and try to have a populist message. %$* 178
on monday you're going to see senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts to west virginia to campaign for natalie tennant, the democratic candidate there. %$* 178
this is really going to be a test for warren. %$* 178
can she go into a red state and resonate with some of those working class voters. %$* 178
and on the same day as warren in west virginia, paul ryan will be there campaigning for the republican shelley moore capito. %$* 178
west virginia, big national state -- %$* 53
i'll close with this. %$* 53
rand paul continues to get most of the buzz among those taking an early look at the 2016 republican presidential maneuvering -- some smart hires for him of late in iowa and new hampshire. %$* 53
he continues what one activist calls a relentless courting of the establishment that is skeptical of him because of his foreign policy views and because of his dad. %$* 53
but there is beginning to be a little bit more buzz about a guy we had almost forgotten, marco rubio -- remember the freshman senator from florida? %$* 53
he's given a number of policy speeches in recent weeks and months and he's also doing things the old-fashioned way, using his political action committee to dole out money to key republicans in key states and key races, so more of a buzz brewing about rubio. %$* 53
but remember it was the immigration debate in the senate a little more than a year ago that caused his start of fade -- a lot of people watching to see if he wanders into the immigration debate now at a time he's starting to  of a comeback. %$* 53
that's it for this week's inside politics. %$* 53
thanks again for sharing your sunday. %$* 53
we'll see you soon. %$* 53
"state of the union with candy crowley" starts right now. %$* 53

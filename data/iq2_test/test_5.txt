thank you. %$* 13
just so we can you with the camera. %$* 13
if it was up to me-- %$* 19
and would you mind telling us your name, also? %$* 13
my name is reba shemanski if it was up to me, i'd love the marginal tax rate to go back to 91 percent; however, most wealthy people don't pay the marginal tax rate, they get paid in capital gains or carried interests, like your guy, mitt romney. %$* 19
therefore, don't you feel that the capital gains tax-- %$* 19
actually, he gets dividends, but that’s okay-- %$* 14
don't you think-- %$* 19
please let me finish. %$* 19
don't you think the capital gains tax should equal the marginal tax rate? %$* 19
and doesn't mitt romney feel guilty that he pays the same-- %$* 19
all right, all right, all right. %$* 13
you've just disqualified yourself. %$* 13
i'm going to take another question, because we're not playing it that way. %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
my name is john goldberg. %$* 20
the question is to mr. %$* 20
hubbard and mr. %$* 20
laffer. %$* 20
how much do you think that the social contract sort of justice or moral element should play into the conversation? %$* 20
and, to be specific, at one of the debates mr. %$* 20
romney said that he still wants the top 5 percent to pay 60 percent of collections. %$* 20
do you think that is the right number? %$* 20
should it not go up from there? %$* 20
which is, i think-- %$* 20
do you mind-- %$* 13
and there reason i say this is that this debate will, we hope, will live on for months and be heard-- %$* 13
to rephrase your question without actually needing to make the reference to the recent debate, because i think you can and it would let us use this question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 20
thanks. %$* 13
so, the question is, i guess, i've heard that the top 5 percent of these earners-- %$* 20
produce 60 percent of the collections. %$* 20
do you think that's about the right number? %$* 20
there's no question from a tax fairness or social justice point of view that we need a progressive tax system. %$* 14
the wealthy in our society should pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, and i don't think any serious-- %$* 14
at least economist-- %$* 14
has suggested otherwise. %$* 14
but, to me, there's a strong element of social justice that's forgotten in that conversation, and this goes back to the conversation mark and i were having earlier. %$* 14
we really need a society that helps put people back on the ladder, and that's not a discussion of whose marginal tax rate is x or y, but a discussion of how as a country we're going to help those people succeed. %$* 14
that's the social justice. %$* 14
bob reich. %$* 13
but i think that-- %$* 16
i think glenn-- %$* 16
here i want to use the opportunity i have, we have, to agree. %$* 16
you're exactly right, glenn. %$* 16
we want an economy and a society that enables everybody to have an opportunity to make the most of themselves and to go up that ladder. %$* 16
but, as the gap grows, what we are finding is that upward mobility in america is slowing. %$* 16
in fact, relative to places like canada, we have a much slower degree of upward mobility. %$* 16
the chances that a poor kid is going to be a poor adult is greater in the united states than it is-- %$* 16
not only in canada, but greater than in germany, greater than in most of europe, greater than in every place in rich nations other than britain and italy. %$* 16
is it tax-related, this-- %$* 13
it is tax-related, of course it's tax-related, because if we didn't have the problem of upward mobility, that is, if people could easily move upward, than the issue of inequality and the moral essence of what we are talking about would not be as difficult. %$* 16
but is the tax system a solution? %$* 13
is it-- %$* 13
the reason that this proposition is ludicrous and why everybody should vote against it is because we have a system right now where the dice are loaded. %$* 16
they're loaded in favor of people who-- %$* 16
but are you arguing to use the tax system to unload the dice? %$* 13
well, two ways. %$* 16
now, mark said before-- %$* 16
and i think it's a very important point-- %$* 16
that if we are going to have enough revenues to ensure that every child in america has an adequate education, not only k through 12, but hopefully early childhood education, hopefully access to a good public university or even private university-- %$* 16
if education is going to be back to where it was in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s in terms of quality for every young child, that is going to take, whether we want it or not, that's going to take some money to do. %$* 16
and if the rich are not going to pitch in, we are not going to be able to do it. %$* 16
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
first of all, it's useful to know that the tax system in the u.s. does actually lean against in a very powerful way some of the forces that bob and mark have mentioned. %$* 14
i've already mentioned that in the context of the oecd.it's also the case, though, that there's a pretty poor link between changing marginal tax rates at the top and accomplishing much of any of this. %$* 14
it's really a question of setting priorities in government. %$* 14
do we want to be a country that has a few entitlement programs that have all of our spending dollars, or do we want to invest in the future? %$* 14
that's a very legitimate discussion, but it has nothing to do with taxing the rich. %$* 14
mark zandi. %$* 13
yeah, i-- %$* 17
i want to get to a point that glenn has been making, and it's a reasonable one. %$* 17
the tax code does help reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth. %$* 17
if you look at the so-called gini coefficient-- %$* 17
another-- %$* 17
i'm sorry, but this is very easy. %$* 17
so, gini coefficient, best way to measure the income distribution. %$* 17
if it's zero, you've got everyone getting the same income. %$* 17
if it's 1, that's bad. %$* 17
one person's getting all the income. %$* 17
so, the gini coefficient pre-tax is-- %$* 17
back in 1980 was .38. today it's .48. %$* 17
so that means the distribution of income is getting wider. %$* 17
take the tax code, run it through, calculate the gini coefficient, we now go from .34 to .44.so, yeah, it did, in fact, reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth, but the point is the skewing is still very significant and getting wider by the day. %$* 17
and this is a very significant problem. %$* 17
our tax code really hasn't helped with that issue. %$* 17
but put differently, the skewing is a pretax phenomenon. %$* 14
it relates to real phenomena out there in the world, and we can address those phenomena – %$* 14
this is my point, this is the key point-- %$* 17
we have a fiscal problem, we have to address the fiscal problem, we have to do that by looking-- %$* 17
addressing the fiscal problem through the prism of what it means for the distribution of income and wealth. %$* 17
we cannot ignore that. %$* 17
when we think about government spending, and government spending cutbacks, and tax revenue, we have to think about it in the context of tax revenue. %$* 17
but you got to think of it in dynamic terms. %$* 15
that's what you've got to do is what it does to the growth path, what it does to the poverty, unemployment. %$* 15
never before have so many people been so unemployed as they are amongst the poor, amongst the minorities. %$* 15
you know, it's just shocking, what's happening today because of the growth being lost. %$* 15
we've got to achieve the income distribution we want and the prosperity-- %$* 15
through growth. %$* 15
arthur, i have a tweeted question from a josh wolinsky, who is asking about trading off the capital gains tax versus the income tax. %$* 13
and he's basically saying, "should rates be lowered-- %$* 13
should rates be raised on income that comes from buying and selling stuff versus lowered on people who actually make stuff for a living? %$* 13
well, my view is it should be flat rate across the board, just the way it was-- %$* 15
we raised capital gains tax rate in 1986 from 20 to 28 percent. %$* 15
we made it the same as every other. %$* 15
i think that's the way you should go. %$* 15
i think you should get it so that all forms of income are the same. %$* 15
okay, that's not the view of the rest of the table, just so there's no misconception. %$* 14
but that's true. %$* 15
i am truly for a flat tax across the board, and get the hell out of the way, and let people produce-- %$* 15
the optimal tax on savings is zero. %$* 14
i’m carl pope and dr. %$* 21
hubbard i sense a deal, and i want to offer you the deal, but i think the other side would take, but i'm not certain you would. %$* 21
the four of you together come up with $2 trillion in cuts, you each have $500 billion, but you come up with $2 trillion together, you and dr. %$* 21
laffer then have to come up with some package of your choosing, unhampered by politics, of a trillion dollars from cutting marginal rates, closing loopholes, whatever you like, with the sole condition being that the trillion dollars has to be paid by the upper 1 percent and then-- %$* 21
i need you to zoom in for a landing here. %$* 13
okay. %$* 21
and-- %$* 21
all of the additional revenues which result from dr. %$* 21
laffer's anticipated growth, if you do it right, the four of you each get to spend a quarter of it either on the deficit or more federal spending. %$* 21
okay-- %$* 13
but would you take that deal? %$* 21
i didn't understand your question. %$* 13
well, if i understand the question-- %$* 14
then i can give a pretty simple answer to it. %$* 14
there's a recent study that harvey rosen, who's a professor at princeton, has done, it is possible to lower marginal tax rates substantially, broaden the base, get down to a 28 percent rate, with the growth, still have the high income people pay exactly the same tax share, that is, the money is coming from them, if that was your question, that's the answer. %$* 14
okay. %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 16
wait a minute. %$* 16
everybody got the question but me-- %$* 13
it's getting close to the core of the issue. %$* 16
the issue is not broadening the tax base and lowering the rates so the wealthy pay the same as they're paying now. %$* 16
the question is shouldn't the wealthy be paying a larger share? %$* 16
and what mark and i have been arguing is that you have got to. %$* 16
if you are talking about getting the deficit down, reducing the debt, not only do you have to cut federal spending, you also have to rely on some net increase in revenues. %$* 16
and that net increase in revenues we believe should come primarily-- %$* 16
whether it's base broadening or rate increasing it should come primarily from the wealthy. %$* 16
and if you agree with us, then you think this proposition is wrong. %$* 16
let me just say-- %$* 15
you've moved the goalpost several times tonight, but it is the case that-- %$* 14
in the middle here. %$* 13
gentleman in the-- %$* 13
a blue necktie. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 22
my name is phil melville a question, broadly, for the group. %$* 22
i think you all believe growth is good, but i would like to understand that-- %$* 22
i'm not sure about art on that one. %$* 17
but the imf recently put out a paper talking about multipliers, that tax increases have a great impact on the economy than spending cuts. %$* 22
do you believe that's true? %$* 22
and, if so, particularly to mr. %$* 22
zandi, why would you advocate increasing taxes when it'd have a disproportionate effect on the economy? %$* 22
mark zandi. %$* 13
well, to be clear and just to repeat myself, i'm all for raising tax revenue from broadening the tax base. %$* 17
i would prefer not to raise tax rates on anybody, i'd like to even cut them. %$* 17
and, in fact, if we broaden the base enough, art's right, we can lower the tax rates and generate revenue, and that has to come from higher income households. %$* 17
so let's just make that very clear. %$* 17
now, if we're debating the impacts of taxes and spending, it's just the opposite. %$* 17
i mean, my view is, the spending multipliers are larger than the tax multipliers, in general, on average. %$* 17
you know, it depends on the situation, the tax, and the spending, so forth and so on. %$* 17
but, you know, on average that's the case. %$* 17
spending multipliers are larger. %$* 17
now-- %$* 17
but you've heard me before say, i think most of the onus of deficit reduction and achieving fiscal sustainability has to be on the spending cuts, because if you look, again, at current spending and current revenue, it's mostly the spending that's out of line, relative to our historical norms. %$* 17
and we have to get the spending down. %$* 17
and-- %$* 17
let's let glenn hubbard-- %$* 13
and glenn is right, in the longer run, 10, 20, 30 years, we have to address our entitlement programs. %$* 17
that's what's going to kill us. %$* 17
but we could also-- %$* 17
and i'll end here-- %$* 17
we also should do that through the prism of what it means for the distribution of income and wealth. %$* 17
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
i like your question a lot, because sometimes we slip into the use of a word like deficit, which is an accounting term, when what we really mean is taxes and spending. %$* 14
now, your question gets to the core of why it's important to separate those two parts. %$* 14
there's a big difference between changing the path of fiscal policy by raising taxes and cutting spending. %$* 14
and i think the bulk of the evidence would suggest, yes, that the tax increase way would be more costly on the multipliers. %$* 14
i'll tout my intermediate macro textbook, you can turn to the table of multipliers and you'll see that point pretty much from the literature. %$* 14
one more question, sir. %$* 13
hi, van greenfield. %$* 23
when i listen to all these numbers, i'm kind of reminded of, i guess it was twain, we have liars, damned liars, and statistics. %$* 23
and it seems like, probably either of you could argue the other person's point. %$* 23
but the question i have is really to the con side, and that is, it seems to me the fundamental question was raised by glenn at the beginning, which is, what is the size of government that you want? %$* 23
and i'd like to, kind of, move the debate, or move the question, back to what bob was originally talking about, i think, when he was talking about sufficiency and fairness-- %$* 23
i need-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, i need you to repeat the question. %$* 13
what is your position on the fundamental question that glenn raised, which is, the real issue is the size of government, in terms of fairness-- %$* 23
i'm going to pass on that because that's not the issue that we're actually-- %$* 13
i understand that it's related, and i understand it was sandwiched into your argument, but i really want to have a question that provokes more of an understanding of this issue of whose hide is the money supposed to come out of. %$* 13
ma'am, right in the middle there. %$* 13
thank you, with respect. %$* 13
you need a microphone to come to you. %$* 13
i think i'm okay. %$* 19
no, no. %$* 13
the radio needs the microphone. %$* 13
you'll sound like a voice off in the distance and people will wonder what's wrong with that woman. %$* 13
my name is and i'd like to know who's the broader base? %$* 19
what is encompassed in this broadening base that we keep talking about? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
art laffer. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 16
that's exactly-- %$* 16
that's exactly what we have been debating, and you can broaden-- %$* 16
it's art laffer's turn to talk. %$* 13
my turn? %$* 15
and it will be your turn right after that, robert. %$* 13
i did jerry brown's flat tax when he ran for president in 1992, we got rid of all federal taxes. %$* 15
you should look at every tax, not just income taxes. %$* 15
we got rid of the income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, employer and employee; we got rid of excise taxes, capital gains, estate taxes, tariffs. %$* 15
and the only ones we left were sin taxes, which are really small. %$* 15
and, in there, said we had two flat rates, one of business net sales, value added, and one on personal unadjusted gross income. %$* 15
if you did that at full employment, you could have a flat tax rate of 11.8 percent and have it statically revenue-neutral, that's it. %$* 15
you end up-- %$* 15
so who's in the-- %$* 13
who's in the base that's been broadened? %$* 13
everyone's in the base. %$* 15
they're all forms, where you tax warren buffett on his $12 billion income that year, not on $40 million, which is what he had in his agi after all the legal tax deductions. %$* 15
but the mom living on $20,000 who needs to buy her cigarettes would also-- %$* 13
what? %$* 15
the mom living on $20,000 with four kids who wants to buy cigarettes-- %$* 13
yeah, but she'd have a job. %$* 15
that's the whole point. %$* 15
come on. %$* 15
bob reich. %$* 13
i don't mind her paying for her cigarettes. %$* 15
bob reich. %$* 13
i want to talk to your question, because much of this debate has been about exactly that. %$* 16
what do we mean when we talk about broadening the base? %$* 16
and the reality is that average americans, most people-- %$* 16
when they fill out their income taxes, they don't itemize their deductions. %$* 16
the wealthy have a lot of itemized deductions. %$* 16
they take-- %$* 16
i have a lot of tax credits. %$* 16
they use a lot of-- %$* 16
accountants and tax planners who are taking advantage of every single possibility. %$* 16
so, if you are broadening the base in such a way that you are closing some of those opportunities for tax avoidance or tax mitigation, and the net effect is that the wealthy end up paying more than they were paying before, then you are increasing their taxes, and they are, in a sense, generating more revenues. %$* 16
and, if you support that, you don't support tonight's proposition. %$* 16
glenn hubbard, i need you to be terse, because we're out of time. %$* 13
yeah, basically, just to try to really answer your question. %$* 14
there are two things that are on the table being discussed, i think, by tax reformers. %$* 14
one would be some sort of cap on deductions-- %$* 14
that could be a dollar, that could be a percentage of your income. %$* 14
another would be an approach bowles-simpson took, which really cut back a lot on the deductions of affluent people, but left the more in place for moderate income people. %$* 14
either one of those would get you there. %$* 14
can i say just-- %$* 17
all right-- %$* 13
very-- %$* 13
you've got 10 seconds. %$* 13
yeah, really important question, because you have to really think about what we're talking about here. %$* 17
mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving, state and local income taxes, property taxes, you get deductions for education-- %$* 17
one second. %$* 13
medical care, all kinds of-- %$* 17
mark, i have to interrupt you. %$* 13
and that's why it's so difficult to do it. %$* 17
but you're cutting rates at the same time. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 18
ladies and gentlemen, this concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now we go on to round 3.round 3.closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
it is their last chance to try to change your mind before you vote for the second time and choose the winner of this debate. %$* 13
our motion is the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, robert reich. %$* 13
he is a professor at uc berkeley and former secretary of labor in the clinton administration. %$* 13
let's make that an applause line. %$* 13
that would be nice. %$* 13
no, no, no, no, no. %$* 13
i have to be saying it as-- %$* 13
there needs to be some overlap, so let's do that again. %$* 13
thank you for your patience on this. %$* 13
i'm the one who messed it up, not you. %$* 13
summarizing his position against the motion, robert reich, professor at uc berkeley and former secretary of labor in the clinton administration. %$* 13
well, this has been a great debate, and glenn-- %$* 16
i've enjoyed enormously listening to you and trying to respond to you and besting your arguments. %$* 16
and arthur laffer, you are a dear, old friend, and you are as wrong as you always have been. %$* 16
and mark zandi, you are brilliant. %$* 16
let me just say, i think that if you look at the proposition here that we are debating tonight, the proposition is simply that the rich are taxed enough, and what mark and i have been saying, whether you couch it in terms of closing loopholes, broadening the base, increasing marginal income taxes, doesn't matter how you cook it, the still of the question is given that we have a huge budget deficit, somebody has got to pay a little bit more, even if you do a huge amount of cutting of the budget and cutting spending, you still are going to have to raise some revenues. %$* 16
no matter what your ideology is, you're still going to have to raise some revenues. %$* 16
and if you believe, as i do and as mark does, that the rich should bear the lion's share of that revenue raising, then you've got to, please, for the good of your children and your grandchildren-- %$* 16
for the good of america, as solid patriots, you have got to vote against this proposition, because it is, in its entirety, given where we are in this country right now, given the challenges we face, this proposition is simply and unalterably ludicrous. %$* 16
thank you, robert reich. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 16
our motion is: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of the motion is glenn hubbard. %$* 13
he is the dean of columbia business school and economic advisor to mitt romney. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 14
you know, just as oliver wendell holmes famously observed, that paying taxes is actually the price we pay for living in a civilized society. %$* 14
and a civilized society defends itself, it educates its citizens, it cares for those in need, but it's also got to be a society of opportunity and growth, a society of entrepreneurs and businesses, of seeing the fruits of one's own investment in time and in talents, of encouraging investment for tomorrow and not just consumption for today. %$* 14
tonight art and i have argued that confiscatory success taxes are wrongheaded, but they're also wrong. %$* 14
i'd ask two questions of our partners tonight. %$* 14
first, what evidence suggests that the economic consequences of higher tax rates on the successful could improve the employment or the income prospects of the rest? %$* 14
and, second, is the nation better off by raising tax rates on high income people or by balancing fairness and prosperity, asking sacrifice from the affluent through the growth consequences of tax reform, and reforming our spending programs to be a safety net? %$* 14
the question at hand tonight is a broad one and an important one. %$* 14
this country has long identified with equality of opportunity. %$* 14
and i worry a lot right now in our country about economic opportunity. %$* 14
i'm fond of an example that illustrates my worry with an image of the nation as a tall building with the bottom flooded out, the penthouse doing fine, and the elevator broken. %$* 14
we could throw rocks at the top or we could fix the elevator. %$* 14
i think most americans make the latter choice viscerally. %$* 14
and to the points art and i have made tonight, throwing rocks doesn't fix the elevator, and to torture the analogy, can't pay for it. %$* 14
we need to think about growth and fairness. %$* 14
the case for the proposition tonight is very strong. %$* 14
tax rates should not rise. %$* 14
the rich are taxed enough. %$* 14
thank you, glenn hubbard. %$* 13
our motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, mark zandi, chief economist at moodys analytics. %$* 13
well, john, i think-- %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
john, i want to thank you for moderating a great debate. %$* 17
and i really do want to thank glenn and art for being good counterweights here. %$* 17
and, bob, thanks for that great comment. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
i appreciate that. %$* 17
take that with me. %$* 17
and you're a great guy, too, by the way. %$* 17
hey, you know, i actually am cheered by our conversation. %$* 17
it sounds like we were hitting each other over the head. %$* 17
to some degree we were mostly about hitting art over the head. %$* 17
but i think there's a lot of commonality here. %$* 17
i think there's a lot of agreement. %$* 17
i think we agree that our fiscal problems need to be addressed, that these are key to our long term economic success. %$* 17
i think we agree that the distribution of income and wealth is a problem, you know, we're debating a little bit about how we should approach that. %$* 17
but i think we view that as a problem. %$* 17
i think we agree that to address these problems that we do need to cut back on future government spending, that the entitlement programs do need reform, and we do need to think about it in the context of who's going to pay for that reform. %$* 17
the burden of that should probably fall on higher income households. %$* 17
and we agree that we need to generate-- %$* 17
we have to think about the tax side of this. %$* 17
we have to focus on this. %$* 17
but here's where we disagree and that is that we-- %$* 17
bob and i believe that we need to raise tax revenue, that this has to be a balanced approach to getting us back to something that we would consider appropriate and normal. %$* 17
and i would love to do it through closing deductions and loopholes in the tax code. %$* 17
i think that would be the best way to do it, but we need to be clear eyed about this. %$* 17
and if we can't do it in the way you would like and i would like, we still need to raise the revenue, and we need to raise the revenue by taxing the rich. %$* 17
so you have to vote against this proposition. %$* 17
the rich are not taxed enough. %$* 17
thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
and that is our motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here to make his closing statement in support of the motion, art laffer. %$* 13
he is founder and chairman of laffer associates and laffer investments. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 15
first of all, i'd like to congratulate bob and mark for trying to change the proposition to get a different one. %$* 15
the question is tax rates and, frankly, what glenn have been arguing are, why would you ever want to raise tax rates on the rich if you know it's going to give you less revenue and a less prosperous economy? %$* 15
it's as simple as that and the evidence out there documents that time and time again. %$* 15
one of the ways i would do is lowering tax rates, but doing it by broadening the tax base to keep revenue neutral but creating the growth, prosperity, which would give higher revenues, but with lower rates. %$* 15
if you believe in lower rates and a broader base, you must vote for the proposition that the rich are taxed enough. %$* 15
thank you. %$* 15
thank you, art laffer. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again for your second vote, to go to the keypad at each of your seats. %$* 13
our motion is: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
at this point, if you agree with that motion after everything you've heard, push number one on your keypad. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you are, became, remain, undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we will have the results in about a minute and a half. %$* 13
i think the system is still open so, has anybody not voted? %$* 13
everybody's good. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
while we're waiting for those results to come, the first thing i want to say is that this was a really, really, real pleasure to listen to this debate. %$* 13
the way the four of you brought your game to this, a lot of humor, a lot of respect, actually, for one another. %$* 13
it's what we like to do, and i want to thank all of you for doing it. %$* 13
i'd also like to thank everybody who got up to ask a question, including the questions that didn't get used. %$* 13
it takes a lot of nerve to get up and do it. %$* 13
and some of the questions were brilliant and on targets. %$* 13
and the others were just darn interesting. %$* 13
no, seriously, just not exactly where we wanted to take the discussion tonight. %$* 13
so everybody who got up and asked questions, thanks very much. %$* 13
give them a round of applause. %$* 13
and, finally, in terms of thanks, we want to thank, again, the richmond center for their participation tonight and in making all of this possible. %$* 13
thank you to them. %$* 13
we encourage you to talk about this debate; talk to your friends, tweet about it, blog about it. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us.the hashtag is actually #taxdebate. %$* 13
i think earlier i said our hashtag was #iq2us, that would work, too, but #taxdebate is what we're looking for tonight. %$* 13
we have our next debate coming up next month, it will be on november 14. %$* 13
the motion, the proposition, that we will be arguing is legalize drugs. %$* 13

we don't want to sell out. %$* 13
we would like to sell all of our tickets. %$* 13
if you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, and also if you want to see this one again, there are a lot of ways that you can catch this one and the upcoming ones. %$* 13
we have a livestream on fora.tv and then the debate lives on that site for some time. %$* 13
you can also, as i said earlier, listen to these debates on npr, that's wnyc right here in new york city. %$* 13
or watch them on wnet and the world digital channel. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, you have listened to the arguments for and against on this motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
we had you vote once before the debate and once again afterwards on where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
the teams whose numbers will have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
before the debate 28 percent were for the motion, 49 percent against, and 23 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 30 percent are for the motion, that's up 2 percent. %$* 13
sixty-three percent are against. %$* 13
that is up 14 percent. %$* 13
seven percent are undecided, but this means the vote goes for the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donovan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

a publicly supported institution, so that when you have racial preferences, you are discriminating against taxpayers. %$* 9
you are discriminating not against george bush, not against the legacy kids, not against that. %$* 9
taxpayers either have a right to have equal opportunity for their tax money to be used for their own purposes, that is to get their kids in school, or taxpayers ought to be denied that in favor of race and ethnic preferences. %$* 9
justify your position, those of you who are against the motion, to the taxpayers of new york city when they want to send their kids to higher education. %$* 9
ok, a distinction between public, taxpayer-funded, and private institutions. %$* 33
time wise? %$* 33
sure. %$* 35
city college used to have open admissions, because it recognized that its purpose was to serve all the citizens of the city of new york, and it did that for a while. %$* 35
a lot of white folks who wouldn't have passed any test actually went to city college under the era of open admissions. %$* 35
and yet, when all the sudden people of color began to, quote, unquote, flood, being the metaphor we often use, uh, that hallowed institution of higher learning, then all the sudden we started talking about standards, and criteria, and remediation, and these people aren't really qualified. %$* 35
i think what taxpayers ought to expect is open access and ability to get into institutions they pay for. %$* 35
because to get rid of affirmative action at city college or any public institution is to say that people of color who pay taxes should not expect representation for the taxes that they pay. %$* 35
and the same is true in contracting, and the same is true in public employment. %$* 35
i think city college ought to have open admissions, it worked really well for a lot of white folks for decades, and i think it’s a really good idea for students of color as well. %$* 35
and let me just add a, a— %$* 39
kim crenshaw. %$* 33
a one point to the way that this convenience has done exactly what i have suggested that it would. %$* 39
when this proposal was put on the table, it’s talking about eliminating all affirmative action. %$* 39
it's not talking about eliminating just affirmative action that benefits african-americans. %$* 39
it’s not talking about eliminating affirmative action in higher education. %$* 39
it’s talking about eliminating affirmative action in contracting, in employment, in education, that applies not just to african-americans, but white women, and people of color as well. %$* 39
let me, let me point out what difference it makes to have this convenience focus on african-americans. %$* 39
would any of this make sense if we were talking about white women? %$* 39
would we actually say, well, you know, it turns out that the, uh, scores for white women actually over-predict their performance in law schools, because when they actually get to law schools, even though they're equally qualified, if you take these test scores as meaning qualification, they end up not scoring nearly as well as white men. %$* 39
would we even suggest that? %$* 39
no, we would think that there is something going on in law school that actually has the effect of suppressing their performance. %$* 39
would we talk about women’s cultural values? %$* 39
would we talk about their work ethic? %$* 39
would we talk about any of these things if we were talking about white women? %$* 39
no. %$* 39
would we talk about any of these things if we were talking about asian-americans, or even latinos? %$* 39
so, the reality is that we’re actually trying to attack a wide variety of programs by having a debate that’s as old as this republic about the intellectual inferiority of african-americans. %$* 39
i would submit that you should repudiate this proposition just because it’s not talking about the full range of affirmative action and the beneficiaries who are stake in this conversation. %$* 39
another question from the audience. %$* 33
given, this is a question for the people who are, who are for the motion. %$* 10
my first question is whether or not you agree that integrated educational settings, whether it be in k through 12 or higher education, are important. %$* 10
and then secondly, given the pervasive and serious inequalities that we see in k through 12 education by race, what it is that you propose to do to try and open up the pathways to those institutions? %$* 10
which of the supporters of the, of the motion— %$* 33
i mean, i, look, i agree. %$* 38
terence pell. %$* 33
i think that, uh, there’s real value to integrated education, there’s value to diversity, but that’s really not what this debate is about. %$* 38
this debate is about one’s means used to achieve integration, one means used to achieve diversity. %$* 38
and the way it’s been used to achieve diversity is highly mechanical, and imposes a lot of costs on, uh, african-american students in particular. %$* 38
and what we’re saying is, you’ve got to look at those costs, you can't just sweep them off the table with this, you know, with rhetoric about the value of diversity. %$* 38
we all agree diversity is important. %$* 38
what we disagree about is the means used to achieve the, that diversity— %$* 38
but is it, is it so important, that, that, indeed, if you came into a class, if you were teaching, and saw that, uh, all but one student in, in the room, everyone else is white, would you say, we should be doing something? %$* 33
is it so important that we should go revisit other values we’re pursuing here, given the results i’m seeing? %$* 33
or not quite that important— %$* 33
i, i'm %$* 38
go ahead. %$* 38
i was going to say, i'm glad you put that up, because i'm not convinced that diversity is all that important, uh, diversity in terms of skin color. %$* 34
i think that when we go to school, the people that we befriend, the people in our neighborhoods that, uh, that we hang out with, are people that we share values with. %$* 34
when you talk to college students, and people have been to college, and what was most important about their college experience, it had to do not with the color of the person sitting next to them, but the values of, of the teachers, and those kinds of things. %$* 34
um, of course, i, you know, integration is a great thing. %$* 34
uh, i'm for that. %$* 34
i'm for it when people want to do it. %$* 34
um, am i, am i for people manipulating and forcing people? %$* 34
i don’t think that that’s a good thing, i don’t think that that’s, uh, i don’t think that that’s good for america at all. %$* 34
and i also want to make this point: uh, we talk about how great diversity is, and yet, the schools, who great diversity is for the educational benefits for our students, and yet the schools that are routinely churning out the greatest number of black doctors, the greatest number of black lawyers, are hbcu’s, which are not racially integrated at all: morehouse, spellman, howard, et cetera. %$* 34
ninety-eight, ninety-nine percent black. %$* 34
that is not, in my opinion, a bad thing. %$* 34
and if it is, then tim, maybe we should make sure that we get a critical mass of white girls down at spellman, and uh, be, be on our way— %$* 34
robert, can i interject something quickly— %$* 36
hbcu being historically black colleges and universities. %$* 33
just real quick. %$* 36
one very brief statement, and then if somebody wants to make a very brief statement from the other side, and then on to closing statements. %$* 33
i think we have to be very careful with the words integration and segregation, as they happen to have drifted into certain implications in our time. %$* 36
because often the way we’re using the word segregation today implies something i'm very uncomfortable with, which is that the only way that black people can really excel is if white people are around, and i'm not comfortable with that. %$* 36
and so we talk about schools, and for me, a dominant image is, for example, kip academies, where all the kids are black or brown and poor, and they're being taught very well by dedicated teachers, and there are new kip academies every year. %$* 36
and somehow, on the other hand, especially in academia, it seems that we’re supposed to keep talking about increasing segregation, as if segregation now is always the same thing as it was forty years ago, when actually a whole lot of black kids, poor black kids in a room together can learn very well. %$* 36
that excites me. %$* 36
it is peculiar to me how unexciting that seems to be found by a lot of— %$* 36
i agreed to, i agreed to a brief statement— %$* 33
that, thank you, that was it, that was it. %$* 36
and one rebuttal, if you want to make it, form the side opposing the resolution. %$* 33
well, i guess the only thing that i'm— %$* 39
kim crenshaw. %$* 33
i want to point out to people in, in listening to this, is that this anti-affirmative action argument is really a trojan horse for a whole range of anti-integration, anti-civil rights, anti-equality policies. %$* 39
you’ve heard it, the bottom line is, this whole brown versus board of education experiment, this whole idea of forced integration was a bad idea when it started, and it’s a bad idea now. %$* 39
so what this is, is a roll back. %$* 39
it’s not just about racial preferences, whatever you define that to be. %$* 39
it’s about what kind of society we really want to have. %$* 39
and this other side is happy to have societies, to have institutions that are racially separated, to have communities that do not interact with each other, and have all white institutions, all black institutions, and all asians. %$* 39
that’s a roll back on the basic— %$* 39
that’s a distortion— %$* 36
promise of the civil rights movement. %$* 39
that’s a distortion— %$* 36
well, you’ll all have closing arguments in which to address— %$* 33
i don’t think that that’s what i said— %$* 36
some of what you believe are the misconceptions you’ve heard about the other side. %$* 33
uh, the final remarks from the panelists, uh, are two minutes a piece. %$* 33
at one minute i’ll say one, as, i’ll be as loud as i can in saying that, and then, uh, after that we’ll get to vote on who won the debate. %$* 33
first of all, closing statement, two minutes against the motion, tim wise. %$* 33
you can do it from your, these we can give from the desks, yes. %$* 33
great. %$* 35
um, couple things. %$* 35
first of all, just to address something i think that was frankly disingenuous that was said by terence pell earlier, he said that his organization does not advocate no, uh, discrimination laws applying to the private sector. %$* 35
in may of 2004 i got on their web site, i was writing my book on affirmative action, it’s footnoted in my book, their statement of principles included the following: the center for individual rights believes in the limited application of civil rights law and the right of private individuals to deal with others as they see fit. %$* 35
i'm not sure what that’s supposed to mean other than woolworth’s gets to say, black folks don’t sit here, and cab companies don’t have to give rides. %$* 35
that’s what it suggests, that’s what it suggests. %$* 35
and you don’t have to like that that’s what it suggests, but that was what it said. %$* 35
secondly, everyone up here on that side has said that affirmative action was legitimate in the old days, because of the existence of persistent racial discrimination. %$* 35
they’ve all acknowledged it. %$* 35
which means we’re not debating a principle here tonight of color blindness in all cases, what we’re debating is the issue of facts on the ground. %$* 35
one. %$* 33
if the facts on the ground say that discrimination is still a significant problem, then by definition, by their own admission, the debate is over, and you have to vote for us. %$* 35
that’s not a debate trick, that's basically what they're saying. %$* 35
the only side that has presented any information at all tonight, let alone analysis, as to the existence of ongoing discrimination, is this side of the aisle, which means all of the things i said at the outset, about employment, about contracting, about education, an ongoing white racial preference has been utterly dismissed. %$* 35
if that still exists, their own standard of evaluation says that they lose and that we win. %$* 35
so just make sure you remember that when you punch those little buttons. %$* 35
the bottom line, and i'm going to quote, since i didn't get to ready my reagan quote, i'm going to do this. %$* 35
i promise, if you cut me off, it’s, it’s it, it’s the quote. %$* 35
ronald reagan, when he was governor of california, 1974, last thing he did as he left office was sign into law the affirmative action programs, and here’s what he said. %$* 35
he said, time and experience have shown that laws of anti- discrimination are not enough, justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt a commitment— %$* 35
great. %$* 35
um, couple things. %$* 35
first of all, just to address something i think that was frankly disingenuous that was said by terence pell earlier, he said that his organization does not advocate no, uh, discrimination laws applying to the private sector. %$* 35
in may of 2004 i got on their web site, i was writing my book on affirmative action, it’s footnoted in my book, their statement of principles included the following: the center for individual rights believes in the limited application of civil rights law and the right of private individuals to deal with others as they see fit. %$* 35
i'm not sure what that’s supposed to mean other than woolworth’s gets to say, black folks don’t sit here, and cab companies don’t have to give rides. %$* 35
that’s what it suggests, that’s what it suggests. %$* 35
and you don’t have to like that that’s what it suggests, but that was what it said. %$* 35
secondly, everyone up here on that side has said that affirmative action was legitimate in the old days, because of the existence of persistent racial discrimination. %$* 35
they’ve all acknowledged it. %$* 35
which means we’re not debating a principle here tonight of color blindness in all cases, what we’re debating is the issue of facts on the ground. %$* 35
time! %$* 33
to affirmative action— %$* 35
and again— %$* 33
so as to make equal opportunity a reality. %$* 35
you’ve run out of time. %$* 33
reagan was right, and they're wrong. %$* 35
thank you, tim wise, uh, for those closing remarks. %$* 33
you got your citation of ronald reagan in. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 35
uh, now, as a closing statement, two minutes for the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action,” from joseph phillips. %$* 33
if white folks are so racist, if they come out of the womb hating black folks, why on earth would we trust them to run affirmative action programs designed to bolster the education of black students? %$* 34
that's what i heard him say. %$* 34
so what kind of society do we want? %$* 34
i have a little more faith in the american people than i think some folks on the other side do, because i think that the american people, they’ve spoken loudly in california, they’ve spoken loudly in michigan and washington, they will speak loudly in arizona, and colorado, and other states in the upcoming election, that they are in favor of integrated societies. %$* 34
one. %$* 33
the american people are in favor of equal opportunity. %$* 34
what they want is fairness. %$* 34
i think it’s quite a compliment that more and more people are saying, listen, they're, they're taking the words of my mother, and they're saying, listen, there is no monopoly on brain power. %$* 34
black folks can compete, we want to give them the opportunity, and i think it’s about time. %$* 34
thank you, uh, joseph phillips, for that closing statement. %$* 33
now a closing statement against the motion from khin mai aung. %$* 33
so, in talking about diversity and the benefits of diversity, now let, the other side makes it seem like we’re saying, well, you know, we want racially diverse classes because if you're black you come, you have a certain perspective and you're, you're expected to carry the mantle of that experience, same if you're asian or, or white, or so forth %$* 37
that, that’s not what we’re saying. %$* 37
there has been mountains of evidence about the benefits of a diverse educational environment, and a diverse workplace that was produced. %$* 37
in the university of michigan cases it was produced before the court, and i'm sure that, uh, mr. %$* 37
pell’s organization fought that with the best arguments that they had, and the supreme court voted in favor of diversity. %$* 37
also, with regard to the process that, um, educational institutions use to accept students, it’s a very, it’s a very flexible, individualized process that, that the type of admissions plan that was endorsed by the supreme court in the university of michigan case is individualized, there are no quotas, it’s not mechanical. %$* 37
one. %$* 33
because mr. %$* 37
pell’s organization actually won the case at the undergrad institution which, which found that the undergrad, um, policy at the time was too mechanical, so it’s a very individualized consideration. %$* 37
and, you know, the, the last thing i want to leave you with is, it’s what we call “the causation fallacy.” even if, even without affirmative action, whites’ chances of admission only gets in, at our most prestigious, it only rises at our most prestigious institutions by one to three percent, according to that bowen and bok study, the one by the, um, the university presidents. %$* 37
it only rose by one point five percent for the average white student. %$* 37
that’s because there’s a whole lot more white students than minority students that are applying. %$* 37
so, even without affirmative action it’s not going to increase a lot of people, it’s not going to increase any, any visual applicant’s chances of getting in by a whole lot. %$* 37
so, this whole, um, you know, thing about how every white student hat has been, um, admitted, or even every asian student who, you know, sometimes believes that that’s the case, thinks that i would have gotten in if it wasn’t about affirmative action. %$* 37
that’s simply not true. %$* 37
so, in talking about diversity and the benefits of diversity, now let, the other side makes it seem like we’re saying, well, you know, we want racially diverse classes because if you're black you come, you have a certain perspective and you're, you're expected to carry the mantle of that experience, same if you're asian or, or white, or so forth %$* 37
that, that’s not what we’re saying. %$* 37
there has been mountains of evidence about the benefits of a diverse educational environment, and a diverse workplace that was produced. %$* 37
in the university of michigan cases it was produced before the court, and i'm sure that, uh, mr. %$* 37
pell’s organization fought that with the best arguments that they had, and the supreme court voted in favor of diversity. %$* 37
also, with regard to the process that, um, educational institutions use to accept students, it’s a very, it’s a very flexible, individualized process that, that the type of admissions plan that was endorsed by the supreme court in the university of michigan case is individualized, there are no quotas, it’s not mechanical. %$* 37
thank you, khin mai aung, uh, for that closing statement against the motion. %$* 33
and now a closing statement in favor of the motion “it’s time to end affirmative action” from john mcwhorter. %$* 33
i think that when we’re evaluating this debate, a crucial thing to realize is that there is no denial on any of our part that there is inequality in our society. %$* 36
this is the crucial point: looking at the nation that we’re in, looking at the history of the world, looking at the nature of our species, it is logically unclear to me that there ever could be a human society where the playing field is completely level. %$* 36
now, we can work on things, but it’s always going to be imperfect, and it’s going to be imperfect enough to matter. %$* 36
you can be committed to social justice while realizing that because society cannot be perfect, what our job is, is to teach people who didn't come out with as many chips as we would have liked, to cope and do the best that they can despite the imperfections of the system. %$* 36
now, somebody is down on the bottom, of course, i personally am in favor of there being help, of there being relaxation’s of standards, if necessary. %$* 36
but when this is simply a matter of skin color— %$* 36
one. %$* 33
i think that we have departed from what the original intentions of these policies were. %$* 36
the issue is not waiting for there to be no inequality or discrimination, the idea is, when do you let it go, because there’s never going to be a society that’s completely without it. %$* 36
and in closing i would like to say that there is evidence pro and con for this, and i don't see on the other side any engagement with the con. %$* 36
there is an understandable sense that their arguments are god’s arguments, the only ones worth mattering, and that anybody who has different ideas is funded by sinister people, or has a different agenda, et cetera., et cetera. %$* 36
it’s not true. %$* 36
to be honest, i’ve studied their stuff. %$* 36
i know the pro. %$* 36
there are other arguments written by cogent people, many of them not conservatives, these people don’t see those arguments as worthy of engagement. %$* 36
their case, therefore, is incomplete. %$* 36
i think you should vote for us. %$* 36
i think that when we’re evaluating this debate, a crucial thing to realize is that there is no denial on any of our part that there is inequality in our society. %$* 36
this is the crucial point: looking at the nation that we’re in, looking at the history of the world, looking at the nature of our species, it is logically unclear to me that there ever could be a human society where the playing field is completely level. %$* 36
now, we can work on things, but it’s always going to be imperfect, and it’s going to be imperfect enough to matter. %$* 36
you can be committed to social justice while realizing that because society cannot be perfect, what our job is, is to teach people who didn't come out with as many chips as we would have liked, to cope and do the best that they can despite the imperfections of the system. %$* 36
now, somebody is down on the bottom, of course, i personally am in favor of there being help, of there being relaxation’s of standards, if necessary. %$* 36
but when this is simply a matter of skin color— %$* 36
thank you, john mcwhorter. %$* 33
now, final remarks against the motion from kimberlé crenshaw. %$* 33
when affirmative action was withdrawn at the university of california at berkley, and at ucla, the participation of african- americans and latinos fell to levels that we haven't seen since 1968.when you think about whether you want to vote for this proposal, you should think about whether you're satisfied with that. %$* 39
when you think about whether you want to vote for this proposal, you should think about whether you're satisfied with the fact that women contractors lost a thirty-five percent share of the contracts that they had had in california as the result of 209.when you think about voting for that you need to think about women as well as people of color. %$* 39
now, the other side says we don’t talk about some of this evidence. %$* 39
let me tell you something i will talk about. %$* 39
they tell you that students who graduate from spellman, who go to morehouse, who go to howard miraculously end up doing better than going to the elite institutions that they might otherwise have gotten into, they want you to think that the reason they do better there is they’re over there where they should belong, with all the other black people. %$* 39
one. %$* 33
what they're not telling you is that these institutions have had a track record, knowing how to encourage students, educate students to create an environment where students feel confident to do their best. %$* 39
so, rather than taking that as an indictment of the institutions that have taken qualified students and not allowed them to do their best, they follow the track, and the proven, uh, tradition of focusing on stereotypes about african- americans. %$* 39
so, my point is, if you're unhappy with the inferences that are drawn from this position, if you're not a color- blind fundamentalist, who is not, like condoleezza rice, who is not, then you know that there is still work to be done in this society. %$* 39
you know that this inequality is something that has to be addressed, and you know that just like any other social problem we care about, like asbestos, it would be silly to think we’re going to solve asbestos by being asbestos-blind. %$* 39
it’s silly to think we’re going to solve the problem of race by being color blind. %$* 39
when affirmative action was withdrawn at the university of california at berkley, and at ucla, the participation of african- americans and latinos fell to levels that we haven't seen since 1968.when you think about whether you want to vote for this proposal, you should think about whether you're satisfied with that. %$* 39
when you think about whether you want to vote for this proposal, you should think about whether you're satisfied with the fact that women contractors lost a thirty-five percent share of the contracts that they had had in california as the result of 209.when you think about voting for that you need to think about women as well as people of color. %$* 39
now, the other side says we don’t talk about some of this evidence. %$* 39
let me tell you something i will talk about. %$* 39
they tell you that students who graduate from spellman, who go to morehouse, who go to howard miraculously end up doing better than going to the elite institutions that they might otherwise have gotten into, they want you to think that the reason they do better there is they’re over there where they should belong, with all the other black people. %$* 39
kimberlé crenshaw, thank you very much. %$* 33
now final remarks from terence pell, for the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action.” %$* 33
well, tonight all of us are gathered here to defend the principle of equality, and i think we do that with a sense that equality is under siege as never before, and that’s because real equality is never achieved, it’s always coming into existence. %$* 38
as our opponents say, there’s a lot of work to be done, and that’s true. %$* 38
but today, the challenge to equality doesn’t come from the political extremes, it comes from really the political middle. %$* 38
moderates have tried to eliminate differences in achievement among black and white eighteen year olds by essentially engineering an admissions system that makes them go away, and with characteristic efficiency those preferences have been extended to every institution after, uh, undergraduate college, including professional schools and public and private employment. %$* 38
though they aren't intended to do so, these policies perpetuate racial differences, and they corrode social bonds. %$* 38
they make it difficult for minority high school students to attend schools where their credentials would make them academically competitive. %$* 38
one. %$* 33
and that’s the point about the, uh, historically black colleges. %$* 38
it’s not that blacks ought to go to the hbcu’s, it’s that the white schools, the elite schools ought to learn from the way the hbcu’s run their admissions programs, they admit on the basis of merit, and it makes a big difference. %$* 38
the most troubling aspect about tonight’s debate has been the reaction of our opponents to efforts to disclose the problems and end these policies. %$* 38
our opponents essentially demand that we continue to wink at real differences in qualification, and demand also that we remain discreetly silent about the predictable consequences of this winking. %$* 38
it’s time to put an end to race preferences, it may have been a good idea at one point, but it no longer serves a useful purpose. %$* 38
there are too many other important issues that we need to be talking about if we’re going to achieve real equality in our lifetime. %$* 38
well, tonight all of us are gathered here to defend the principle of equality, and i think we do that with a sense that equality is under siege as never before, and that’s because real equality is never achieved, it’s always coming into existence. %$* 38
as our opponents say, there’s a lot of work to be done, and that’s true. %$* 38
but today, the challenge to equality doesn’t come from the political extremes, it comes from really the political middle. %$* 38
moderates have tried to eliminate differences in achievement among black and white eighteen year olds by essentially engineering an admissions system that makes them go away, and with characteristic efficiency those preferences have been extended to every institution after, uh, undergraduate college, including professional schools and public and private employment. %$* 38
though they aren't intended to do so, these policies perpetuate racial differences, and they corrode social bonds. %$* 38
they make it difficult for minority high school students to attend schools where their credentials would make them academically competitive. %$* 38
terence pell, thank you very much. %$* 33
that concludes the final remarks. %$* 33
it’s now time for you to decide who carried the day. %$* 33

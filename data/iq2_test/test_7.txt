“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” to put it into context, we live in an environment—and this is especially true of europe—where muslims constantly face xenophobia. %$* 30
while the overwhelming majority of the world’s 1.2 billion muslims do not partake in any violent actions in response to these political cartoons, a tiny, minuscule minority has grabbed the world’s attention and apparently now has absolute command of how muslims are to be perceived. %$* 30
this is coupled with a time when a new generation of european-born muslims have emerged that routinely face discrimination, alienation, and are often perceived as threats in their own countries. %$* 30
and all this while the violence in iraq continues to surpass its already shocking levels. %$* 30
clearly, we’re living in a very tense time. %$* 30
in such a situation, for a right-of-center danish newspaper to come out with cartoons that show the prophet of islam with a bomb in his turban, with a sword in his hand, and with a menacing look on his face does nothing, absolutely nothing, to advance desperately needed dialogue, or enlighten people in any positive way. %$* 30
if it does anything at all, it serves to suppress constructive dialogue by fueling extremist sentiments. %$* 30
it is important to note that this example has little to do with religion, though i think philip and christopher would probably tell you that’s the case. %$* 30
this isn’t about drawing the prophet, for which there are many “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” historical precedents in traditional muslim art. %$* 30
to see the situation clearly, we must all understand nuance. %$* 30
that’s what intellectuals are here for—for nuance, for teaching us the nuance. %$* 30
my jewish rabbi friend called me right after the cartoon crisis and said, “what are you doing about the cartoons? %$* 30
” i said, “what are we going to do? %$* 30
it’s just a cartoon.” he said, “no. %$* 30
don’t ever accept it. %$* 30
this is what they did to us in germany. %$* 30
they started with the cartoons”— %$* 30
so when you publish cartoons which of course are a form of entertainment and hence immensely popular—and signe, i loved that cartoon of the radical islam contest—as a medium for conveying a particular message, or a speech is given by a person of immense power like the pope, which further drives people apart and cements stereotypes, you’re using public discourse to malign the way an already marginalized community is perceived. %$* 30
this, my friends, is not in accordance with our foundational values of free speech. %$* 30
this is un-american. %$* 30
the point is not whether such things can or cannot be published. %$* 30
but of course, they are published. %$* 30
who’s preventing them? %$* 30
the issue is whether there’s any wisdom in showing the prophet of islam with a bomb in his turban no less. %$* 30
this is the sort of thing that furthers that familiar, yet dangerous and unsound argument, some muslim men are terrorists, therefore, all or even most muslim men are terrorists. %$* 30
now this last statement is certainly something we can say, something that is enshrined in free speech. %$* 30
but is it true? %$* 30
is it responsible? %$* 30
does it elevate the public discourse? %$* 30
or is it simply racist, xenophobic drivel, that isn’t half as clever as it purports to be? %$* 30
there are a few additional things to say. %$* 30
while modern “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” technology has allowed us to improve our communication, it also means that ideas, news and statements can be disseminated at a global level very rapidly. %$* 30
the upshot is that the global distance is of little relevance in assessing how close we are to each other. %$* 30
so the notion of space, of sharing space with our neighbors, needs to be negotiated and reexamined. %$* 30
what is needed now is a heightened sense of awareness that enables us to distinguish between useful and useless affronts. %$* 30
truly, few things are more useless than statements that exasperate bigotry and racism. %$* 30
finally, in keeping with my previous point, i want to make a point about individual psychology in various societies. %$* 30
we’re always shocked at how people in the global south react vociferously, especially my people, muslims, and at times violently, to what we see as simple free speech which may or may not undermine their value system. %$* 30
what we do not realize in our dismay is that in societies where the basics are not guaranteed, where one life, liberty, property, and family are not protected, individuals deal with disparities by developing a greater collective consciousness, where one identifies strongly with a larger community, in our case the uma, and the collective values it represents. %$* 30
something that is perceived to threaten or undermine those values are resolved not an individual level, but are resolved in a group dynamic which can sometimes “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” result in chaotic mob reaction, which you’re all familiar with. %$* 30
in an environment defined by major uncertainties, heightened inequities, depictions like the danish cartoons are perceived as yet another attack on what for some people sadly remain the final salvation—their dignity and their faith. %$* 30
and signe’s right, religious people are the touchiest. %$* 30
it should come as no surprise, then, to see that— %$* 30
i want to just finish one last— %$* 30
the rabbi is my secret weapon and i told him i would never do this. %$* 30
ultimately, the question to ask is do we use our free speech to insult an already marginalized people? %$* 30
or do we use it to advance and enhance a desperately needed discourse between people living in an increasingly interconnected world. %$* 30
i hope you’ll throw out the other motion. %$* 30
thank you. %$* 30
excuse me— %$* 29
wait, wait. %$* 24
come on, come on. %$* 24
no, that’s offensive. %$* 29
well— that— %$* 24
that’s stupid. %$* 29
well—no, come on, christopher, no, no, christopher, come on. %$* 24
stupid, nasty— %$* 29
christopher, come on. %$* 24
daisy, this will not be deducted from your time. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
so when you publish cartoons which of course are a form of entertainment and hence immensely popular—and signe, i loved that cartoon of the radical islam contest—as a medium for conveying a particular message, or a speech is given by a person of immense power like the pope, which further drives people apart and cements stereotypes, you’re using public discourse to malign the way an already marginalized community is perceived. %$* 30

daisy, that’s time. %$* 24
i want to just finish one last— %$* 30
well, finish the sentence, finish the sentence. %$* 24
finish by naming the rabbi. %$* 29
stop— %$* 24
i want to know who that rabbi was— %$* 29
sorry, we’ll get to that. %$* 24
we’ll get to that— %$* 24
name that rabbi— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
christopher— %$* 24
name that rabbi— %$* 29
the rabbi is my secret weapon and i told him i would never do this. %$* 30
ultimately, the question to ask is do we use our free speech to insult an already marginalized people? %$* 30
or do we use it to advance and enhance a desperately needed discourse between people living in an increasingly interconnected world. %$* 30
i hope you’ll throw out the other motion. %$* 30
thank you. %$* 30
okay. %$* 24
thank you, daisy khan. %$* 24
all right, before we get to the questions, i’m now ready to present the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 24
before the debate, 177 of you voted for the proposition, 25 against, and 24 don’t know. %$* 24
so we’ll see if that changes. %$* 24
we’re now ready to begin the q-and-a portion of the program. %$* 24
i will call on the questioners, and someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone. %$* 24
please stand when you ask your question, and i ask that you please make your questions short and to the point. %$* 24
members of the press should identify themselves as such. %$* 24
members of the audience who are not of the press can identify themselves or not as they see fit. %$* 24
why don’t “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” you, sir, ask the first question. %$* 24
my name is barry fredericks. %$* 31
i have a question. %$* 31
have you all forgotten about gallileo? %$* 31
i mean this conversation about religious problems and insulting people, i mean, we’ve tried that case in the third century. %$* 31
do we want to go back? %$* 31
i notice there are groups in the islamic world that’d like to go back to the 13th century. %$* 31
but do we really want to make that argument. %$* 31
okay, that’s a good question. %$* 24
who would like to respond. %$* 24
i’m for going back to the 13th century, personally. %$* 25
yeah. %$* 25
is that the question? %$* 25
he was much on my mind as i came here tonight. %$* 27
but i thought, here i am, facing the anti-gallilean forces once again %$* 27
and i expected them to be very, very old, so this %$* 27
very strange. %$* 27
very strange arrangement. %$* 27
if i can— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” david? %$* 28
yes, the gentleman has repeated a hoary old myth about gallileo. %$* 28
he actually was not persecuted— %$* 28
i find the word “hoary” offensive. %$* 27
—for his astrological discoveries. %$* 28
he was persecuted for various other things. %$* 28
he was patronized by the pope, and he didn’t get into trouble with the pope until he crossed swords with the papacy on completely different issues. %$* 28
that’s not true. %$* 31
he was %$* 31
the next debate is about gallileo, so— %$* 24
read some history books that have been written within the last 30 years. %$* 28
i have. %$* 28
all right, why don’t we have another question? %$* 24
yes, ma’am. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
i just want to make the point, and i think this is directed at daisy, who talked about racism and bigotry, and then just talked about her jewish friend. %$* 31
you are against the motion to offend, and yet i think you offended most of the people in this room. %$* 31
if anybody has a comment on that, i’d like to hear it— %$* 31
yes, i have a comment, i wasn’t offended. %$* 28
i wasn’t offended and i’m jewish— %$* 28
my jewish friend came to my aid and came to the aid of my community— %$* 30
nor was i, actually, i was only pretending to be. %$* 29
i was just fascinated that she only had one. %$* 27
i don’t believe she has one. %$* 29
i want to know that rabbi’s name. %$* 29
it ought to be traceable. %$* 27
could i suggest that she speak to some others, because really, it’s not a majority view amongst jews, and to try and invoke her one jewish friend to paint this majority view is quite preposterous. %$* 27
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 27
now what you’re saying, philip, is preposterous. %$* 28
throughout europe, the jewish communities were very divided over the danish cartoon issue. %$* 28
the european jewish communities have— %$* 27
well, let him finish— %$* 24
hello— %$* 28
—been virtually eradicated— %$* 27
let him finish, let him finish. %$* 24
just a minute. %$* 28
david, go ahead. %$* 24
they live here, buddy. %$* 27
they live here now. %$* 27
no. %$* 27
david. %$* 27
a lot of the jewish communities in europe, including the jewish “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” community in britain, and these views are articulated by the chief rabbi, jonathan sachs, who felt that the cartoons were not only offensive but were dangerous for the reasons that daisy gave. %$* 28
yes, because to many jewish people that kind of demonization of a religion and a religious-ethnic group brought back some very sick and bad memories. %$* 28
that is why in europe— %$* 28
yes, of people burning books in the street— %$* 27
—there is a much greater tolerance of what this side of the house is advocating than on that side, which is displaying an extraordinary degree not only of disrespect but also of arrogance and an astonishing unwillingness to face a real past. %$* 28
i’m highly interested in facing a real past and that’s particularly why i feel that if your belief is that by muzzling nazis you’re making us safe, i hope you’re not watching my back when they come back at us. %$* 27
i’m telling you the truth. %$* 27
if you think that there’s a mute button, and that by saying, oh, nazis can’t speak in public, nazis must be put in jail. %$* 27
we’re going to eradicate nazism, rather than by having nazis in a country where you can actually speak to them and argue with them, and not dignify them by putting them on trial every time they say something completely idiotic. %$* 27
you’re elevating nazis and putting “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” them down and then inciting a couple of politicians in europe. %$* 27
it doesn’t dignify them. %$* 28
david irving’s battle against deborah lipstadt exposed him for what he was, it was very effective. %$* 28
he had faced— %$* 28
he exposed himself for what was, he said the holocaust didn’t exist and it did. %$* 27
if you were to eradicate all false history you’d have to stop all newspapers, it’s ridiculous. %$* 27
i beg your pardon. %$* 25
faced by a prison sentence, david irving courageously renounced all that he’s previously said about denying the holocaust. %$* 28
the trial was very effective, and i don’t actually agree with putting people in prison for advocating nazi propaganda and a version of the protocols of the elders of zion because that’s what david irving does. %$* 28
it’s not a kind of genteel rewriting of history which christopher seems to think. %$* 28
it is the most poisonous kind of conspiracy theory— %$* 28
why do i seem to think that? %$* 29
well, it’s what you said in your article— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 28
to the contrary. %$* 28
very much to the contrary——and what you said just earlier, that he is engaged in the revision of history. %$* 28
he’s not, he’s a neo-nazi propagandist, and this is what justice gray said in the verdict in his battle with deborah lipstadt. %$* 28
he is a neo-nazi political activist, and he is using distorted history to propagandize for his cause. %$* 28
and nobody had much heard of him until you put him on trial. %$* 27
well, you can fill it, you’re a journalist, you’re supposed to know these facts. %$* 28
he’s a best-selling author. %$* 28
he’s very important guy, he gets into people’s living room. %$* 28
not for a while though, because he’s in a prison cell. %$* 28
nazis always get in the living room, but— %$* 27
his book, his edition of the goebbels diary is a very useful and interesting book that everyone who wants to know more about the period should read. %$* 29
let’s get some more— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
for example, it’s only in that book that it’s proved that the british union of fascists took money from the nazi party, a claim they’d always denied. %$* 29
the question is, do you think you’re big enough to read a book by david irving and make up your own mind about it, or do you think that someone else should do that for me. %$* 29
right? %$* 29
yes, next question. %$* 24
a very simple question. %$* 29
alan miller, new york salon. %$* 31
i do take issue particularly with david cesarani’s view, when he talks about how vulnerable everyone is. %$* 31
it’s almost like an egalitarian-speak, this notion that humans are not robust and cannot discuss ideas and make decisions and be autonomous. %$* 31
so my question to the panel tonight is, when it comes to the really tricky, sticky issues, like we see around children and pedophilia, or as we see on the campuses, where we see speech etiquette, or when we see in the workplaces speeches of code, would they agree with the prospect that you should have the right to be offensive, and free speech at all times. %$* 31
that’s my question to them. %$* 31
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 31
mari, can you address that? %$* 24
the line that i draw is between the right to dissent, to express your opinion, if you’re gallileo, to oppose the powers that be and say that the sun is the center of the universe, that’s free speech. %$* 26
that’s what we need for democracy to thrive. %$* 26
the speech that i think is of lower value and that i’m asking us to consider restricting is speech that assaults, wounds, degrades and excludes. %$* 26
let me give you a specific example since you raised the workplace. %$* 26
it’s a frequent pattern that the first woman to show up in a traditionally male job, in the coalmine, on the oil rig, is relentlessly harassed—with words. %$* 26
men describing her body, and saying they would like to rape her, and describing what that would be like. %$* 26
she goes to work every day and tries to do her job, up on a construction site. %$* 26
i think that goes beyond offense. %$* 26
i think that is an effort to exclude. %$* 26
people use these words because they’re tied to a history of violence, because they do terrorize people, and that is their intent. %$* 26
now the other side is trying to say that we’re for opening the door of censorship. %$* 26
i certainly don’t stand for that. %$* 26
i think that this audience voted in the vast majority for the proposition precisely because they distrust censorship, and that’s good, that’s “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” important. %$* 26
any effort to limit speech has to be done carefully, through the rule of law, with discernment. %$* 26
but we can do it. %$* 26
we’ve done that with defamation. %$* 26
we allow people to insult each other, but we don’t allow them to destroy character and reputation in ways that the law calls actual malice. %$* 26
it’s very close to requiring intent. %$* 26
that’s a limit, that means that a lot of very nasty speech is still allowed. %$* 26
but we’re trying to create that breaching space so that women can go to work, so that that family that’s the wrong race can move into that neighborhood, where we can have conversations like this one that are very hard. %$* 26
if it degenerates into name-calling the conversation shuts down, and what i’m trying to do is prevent the conversation-ending move in a world in which we need to talk. %$* 26
that’s mari matsuda, signe wilkinson? %$* 24
one little example of how this works in the real world was in the mid-‘90s at the university of pennsylvania. %$* 25
there were some kids making noise outside of a dorm room. %$* 25
some guy leaned out the window and told the water buffaloes to shut up. %$* 25
the water buffaloes took it to the speech code people at the university. %$* 25
had they not, the guy who had said “water buffaloes” would’ve been the jerk that he was, but as it turned out, then the girls who got “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” all upset about it made a federal case out of it. %$* 25
they ended up looking stupid, as did the administration of the university of pennsylvania. %$* 25
water buffaloes, i mean where are you going to draw the line? %$* 25
it’s an animal, it’s not like saying— %$* 25
a very nice animal— %$* 29
—i’m going to kill you. %$* 25
so to me it’s like %$* 25
if you let someone say something stupid, they’re the ones who look idiotic. %$* 25
if then you start—like david irving, i might add—but when you start taking him on and like christopher said giving him the platform, then it’s you who are starting to look like you can’t quite join the debate. %$* 25
let’s take another question. %$* 24
can you hand that woman the microphone? %$* 24
i’m sorry. %$* 24
we’ll get to you next. %$* 24
okay, my question is the following. %$* 31
there was a cartoon in the new york times a couple of weeks ago which was never talked about, and it was from ohio. %$* 31
they always do a synopsis of cartoons that they think are particularly relevant— %$* 31
yes, we know. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
so it was the pope saying, “i’m sorry that my remarks about islamic violence provoked islamic violence.” now, nobody made a big scene about that, but who made the big scene about the danish cartoon, who fired up the world about the danish cartoon. %$* 31
who got it started was an islamic cleric, who got everybody in an uproar— %$* 31
so what’s your question? %$* 24
so my question is, why does this happen only in this situation when it was outside of the united states, and why did it not happen here. %$* 31
okay. %$* 29
daisy, do you have a response? %$* 24
i think that was mostly addressed to you. %$* 24
yes. %$* 30
well, i think what happened with the danish cartoon was that when the cartoon was published there was a small demonstration by certain muslim groups. %$* 30
the newspaper decided they were not going to pay any attention to that because they had a license to free speech and expression which was fine. %$* 30
then “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” they took it up to some of the ambassadors of muslim countries and they were hoping that their intervention might have helped with the situation. %$* 30
the ambassadors called for a meeting with the prime minister, and that meeting was refused. %$* 30
as you know, the ambassadors were ambassadors from various muslim countries, and they wanted to have a meeting with him. %$* 30
he basically said i have nothing to do with this because this is not within my realm. %$* 30
they called for a lawsuit, and that lawsuit was not pursued. %$* 30
basically the community felt their hurts and their concerns were not being addressed. %$* 30
they went overseas and sought support from overseas and then the whole situation went out of control— %$* 30
they started a pogrom. %$* 27
so wait, wait, no— christopher’s turn to—let christopher respond— %$* 24
no, i just want to finish the point. %$* 30
what i’m saying is that had it been addressed at the local level it would have never become the international phenomenon that it became. %$* 30
it should be addressed at the local level, like signe did. %$* 30
when the philadelphia inquirer decided to publish that same carton, they called the muslim community and said we want to do something “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” about this and we want to create dialogue. %$* 30
now that was responsible, that was socially responsible. %$* 30
christopher, go ahead. %$* 24
when dr. %$* 29
samuel johnson had finished his great lexicography, the first real english dictionary, he was visited by various delegations of people to congratulate him, including a delegation of london’s respectable womanhood who came to his parlor in fleet street and said doctor, we congratulate you on your decision to exclude all indecent words from your dictionary. %$* 29
he said, “ladies, i congratulate you on your persistence in looking them up.” i think anyone who understands that story, which i’m pleased to see everybody obviously does, will see through the sinister piffle we were treated to just now. %$* 29
if people are determined to be offended, if they will climb up on the ladder, balancing it precariously on their own toilet system, to be upset by what they see through the neighbor’s bathroom window, there’s nothing you can do about that. %$* 29
the imams in denmark did the following. %$* 29
first, they invited the intervention of 22 foreign ambassadors in denmark’s internal affairs, itself a disgrace, and the danish prime minister quite rightly repudiated it. %$* 29
then they added two cartoons of their own, drawn by them, one of them “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” showing the prophet mohammed in the shape of a pig, then they shopped those round the muslim world until they could get kindling going under the embassies of a small democracy in the capitol cities of countries where demonstrations are normally not allowed. %$* 29
they violated danish diplomatic immunity, they tried to sabotage the danish economy, there were random pogroms and attacks on individual scandinavians. %$* 29
and, david cesarani says he doesn’t like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is inscribed in the cartoon. %$* 29
i don’t like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is involved in a kristallnacht against denmark, put up by religious demagogues and thugs, and that’s what needs to be put down. %$* 29
david cesarani. %$* 24
i actually agree with much of what christopher has just said. %$* 28
i think the response in the muslim communities and in muslim countries, and in countries of large muslim populations was abysmal. %$* 28
but i will absolutely defend the right of muslims to protest in peaceful ways against those cartoons and to lobby. %$* 28
so would i. “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
so would all of us. %$* 27
gooooood, okay, there’s a measure of agreement. %$* 28
we all agree— %$* 27
now, let’s see if we can push it a bit further— wow, you— %$* 28
wait, wait, wait, let him finish— %$* 24
just stop interrupting— %$* 28
—we had a beautiful moment of agreement. %$* 24
so let’s, let’s, let’s let david go ahead. %$* 24
you’re an angry man. %$* 28
let’s think about this town. %$* 28
new york, new york. %$* 28
the gentleman there asked the question about who are these marginal, vulnerable groups. %$* 28
it’s kind of interesting that a lot of people, certainly on that side, have decided, well, muslim, they’re not vulnerable or marginal, they don’t need protection. %$* 28
if you exclude them, who’s left. %$* 28
gay men %$* 28
women, “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” probably not, jews, definitely not. %$* 28
but how do we get to that position where gays or jews in this town, are so strong, so powerful, so invulnerable. %$* 28
so much so that when jesse jackson had the temerity and the misfortune to refer to this great city as hymietown, it was the end of his political career. %$* 28
i don’t know how christopher hitchens or philip or signe want to talk about gay men and women, but i guess there are quite a few epithets and words they would not use— %$* 28
i have no idea— %$* 27
—to describe their lifestyle or sexual preferences. %$* 28
then there’s the n word. %$* 28
the n word. %$* 28
do you want it back? %$* 28
christopher? %$* 28
do you want it on prime-time tv, front page of newspapers? %$* 28
i don’t want you jailing people for using it— %$* 27
do you want it back, do you want cartoons of lynchings? %$* 28
well, allow me to answer— %$* 27
is that what you want? %$* 28
what kind of foolishness is this— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
is it all right to inflict that on muslims but not on gay men, not on jews— %$* 28
don’t be silly— %$* 29
you’re being completely preposterous. %$* 27
all right, no, wait—you’re getting yourself all— you’re getting your knickers all in a twist here— %$* 27
okay, philip, go ahead, answer—he asked a question, answer his question— %$* 24
allow me to say that you’re just creating a lot of fantasies for yourself that are quite ridiculous. %$* 27
it’s not a— %$* 28
no, wait, let, let philip—christopher, let philip— %$* 24
i take it as— first of all— %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 27
i take it— %$* 29
go ahead. %$* 27
it’s my turn— %$* 27
i am going to take it as a tribute to the superior cogency of our side that there’s this repeated change of subject from the other side. %$* 29
for example. %$* 29
no, it’s not the— %$* 28
nobody says it would be a good thing if the word “nigger” appeared all the time in the press. %$* 29
what we say is that those who want to be offended don’t have the right to close down the newspapers that offend them. %$* 29
nor by the way is the reason that word “nigger” doesn’t appear in the press because you would jail people who put it there. %$* 27
i appeal to anyone in this audience— %$* 29
the advertisers wouldn’t show or— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 27
one at a time— %$* 24
i appeal to any— %$* 29
ah, the power of capital! %$* 28
that’s a good defense. %$* 28
i appeal to any male— %$* 29
it is. %$* 27
i appeal to any male in this audience— %$* 29
quite proud of it. %$* 27
—who might see a woman being insulted at work or perhaps on the subway or on a bus or on the street or in a bar or in a restaurant, by an obscene, loudmouthed man. %$* 29
there isn’t a man in this room i’m sure whose sword wouldn’t flash in his scabbard, to defend the rights of womanhood in such a case. %$* 29
if that wasn’t the case, there’s going to be no law that will protect women from men with tourette’s syndrome, i’m awfully sorry to say. %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
may i have my turn? %$* 27
it’s just an attempt to change— %$* 29
let’s get another question here— %$* 24
i actually want to respond though to what was said— no, you can’t respond to him, he’s on your side! %$* 24
no, you asked me— you asked me to respond to david cesarani. %$* 24
no, hold it, let’s let the audience— %$* 24
you wanted me to respond to david cesarani— %$* 27
—get involved here— %$* 24
—who specifically was saying that he agreed with us on a point which he previously disagreed with us on which is the idea that he thought it was appropriate that there should be peaceful protests. %$* 27
however, he objected— “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 27
philip, really— %$* 24
—to the idea that any jewish leaders in america should peacefully protest what was being said by tony judd by saying that they should not be allowed to put pressure on an organization— next— %$* 27
—where he spoke. %$* 27
stop. %$* 27
that’s absurd. %$* 27
philip— paul, go ahead, wait, paul has a question, hold on, hold on— %$* 24
i’d love to ask a question quickly, my name is paul holdengraber, i’m the director of public programs at the new york public library. %$* 31
i feel for this side which is opposed because they’ve been so terribly weak and i would be surprised that after this debate there are more than two or three people on your side. %$* 31
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” but be that as it may, i would like— %$* 31
what makes you think that? %$* 30
well, i would like to— %$* 31
no campaign speeches, ask a question, paul. %$* 24
—simply ask this question of david cesarani. %$* 31
i don’t understand why on earth you brought up the example of tony judd. %$* 31
you mentioned it, you didn’t explain it, you said nothing about it. %$* 31
could you say something cogent about that at least. %$* 31
okay. %$* 28
david cesarani. %$* 28
i’ll try and be cogent. %$* 28
it comes back to the question that christopher hitchens quite correctly raised. %$* 28
who decides on these speech issues, on hate speech. %$* 28
now, i think that american campuses are actually exemplary in this respect, and i think the american government has found a way of demarcating what it is permissible to say and what is offensive and dangerous, without going to law. %$* 28
i think that sets a precedent of how you can decide. %$* 28
i don’t think it is terribly good when powerful individuals phone up institutions, and by the tone of their voice have meetings “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” canceled. %$* 28
i think there may be very good grounds for objecting and protesting, i think it is permissible to lobby. %$* 28
but i think that kind of intervention is not a good idea. %$* 28
i certainly don’t think that we should leave the defense of the weak and the marginal up to the advertisers, which seems to be what philip believes is the way to defend our interests. %$* 28
philip gourevitch? %$* 24
all i said, that he’s trying to refer to in that bizarre quip, is that the reason that you don’t have the word “nigger” or that you don’t have a lot of the derogatory images that he was sort of proposing in a heated moment that—would you like to see these things returned to the public airwaves, ohhhh, was that they’re not on the public airwaves not because we’ve actually outlawed them and thrown everybody in jail in austria as you advocate, but actually because— no, i said— %$* 27
—they’re not on the public airwaves. %$* 27
because one would not get an audience for them because people would protest those stations because people would make firm phone calls exercising their freedom of speech to say, you know what? %$* 27

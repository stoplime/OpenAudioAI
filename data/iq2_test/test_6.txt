can i ask everyone to come sit down, please? %$* 24
hello. %$* 24
my name’s jeffrey toobin, i’m the moderator and warm-up act here today, and i just wanted to explain a few things before we got started. %$* 24
the first thing i wanted to say, which i’m sure is a great shock to you, is please turn off your cell phones. %$* 24
ah, see, everybody’s %$* 24
also, please unwrap any delicious candies you plan on eating during the program. %$* 24
now, i say this not because it is incredibly annoying to listen to both cell phones and candy unwrapping, but if you look above you, you will see that there are microphones. %$* 24
this event is being recorded and is going to be broadcast on wnyc and other npr stations next friday at 2 p.m. %$* 24
in an edited form. %$* 24
now, that is significant just because it’s interesting, but it also means that you are an integral part of the broadcast. %$* 24
your questions, when it comes to that, but also your reactions. %$* 24
if you want to clap, if you want to laugh, by all means feel free. %$* 24
this is not a solemn occasion, you’re expected to participate in it. %$* 24
extended booing is discouraged but please, have “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” fun. %$* 24
now, this is very good, because i’m also supposed to, as a radio check, ask you to give a rousing round of applause. %$* 24
so since our panelists are coming out, why don’t you do that. %$* 24
let me let robert rosenkranz take over from here. %$* 24
thank you, jeffrey. %$* 1
well, good evening, everyone, and thank you for being here. %$* 1
i’m robert rosenkranz, i’m the chairman of the intelligence squared u.s.debate forum, which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 1
i’m here with dana wolf, our executive producer of this debate series. %$* 1
we’d like to welcome you. %$* 1
this is the second debate of our fall season, and with this season of live debates, and with our national radio audience, we’re pursuing a lofty, ambitious goal. %$* 1
we’re trying to raise the level of public discourse in american life. %$* 1
we see congress mired in partisan rancor, we see a media that’s increasingly ideological, we see policy intellectuals in the think-tank world speaking to their respective choirs. %$* 1
discussion of contentious policy issues everywhere seems to be dominated by intense emotions, rather than by facts and reasoned analysis. %$* 1
but iq squared is not about the search for bland middle ground. %$* 1
rather, we want to encourage each side of an argument to sharpen its own thinking by listening to opposing views, and responding to inconvenient facts. %$* 1
we want our “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” audience, who voted on tonight’s resolution, to vote again after hearing the debate. %$* 1
i hope you’ll come away with the recognition that there is an intellectually respectable position on the other side. %$* 1
we’re thrilled that wnyc is recording our series of debates, and that through national public radio, you’ll be able to hear this debate in many of the major cities across the country, on local national public radio-member stations. %$* 1
we also value the sponsorship of the times of london, and i especially want to thank our moderator, jeffrey toobin of the new yorker magazine, and cnn, whom i will formally introduce momentarily, and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s event. %$* 1
at first blush, tonight’s motion seems like a slam-dunk for the proposers. %$* 1
95 percent of the pertinent quotations i looked at were ringing supports of free speech. %$* 1
but there were a couple of more sardonic observations that are perhaps truer to our real attitudes. %$* 1
here’s heywood broun: “everyone favors free speech in the slack moments, when no axes are being ground.” louis b. mayer: “i respect my executives who disagree with me %$* 1
especially when it means losing their jobs.” well, it’s amusing, but we do indeed live in a world where jobs are lost because of speech. %$* 1
larry summers, for example, lost the presidency of harvard because of remarks offensive to women. %$* 1
senator george allen may well lose “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” his because of a highly arcane ethnic epithet. %$* 1
so given the heightened sensitivity of so many groups in american society to demeaning speech, we should hardly be surprised that speech offensive to muslims elicits so strong a reaction, as appalled as we may be by the associated violence. %$* 1
i’m now going to hand the evening over to our moderator, jeffrey toobin. %$* 1
jeffrey is senior legal analyst for cnn worldwide, and is staff writer at the new yorker, where he’s been covering legal affairs since 1993.he and i are both alumni of the harvard law school. %$* 1
he joined cnn from abc news where he provided legal analysis on such high-profile cases as the elian gonzales custody saga, for which he received the emmy award. %$* 1
jeffrey’s fifth book, on the supreme court, is due out next year, and it’s called the nine: inside the secret world of the supreme court. %$* 1
you’re the first to know that title because it was only decided upon today. %$* 1
i’m now very pleased to turn the evening over to jeffrey. %$* 1
thank you, enjoy the debate. %$* 1
thank you, bob rosenkranz, and welcome to the second intelligence squared us debate. %$* 24
let me give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 24
first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 24
the opposition will follow. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 24
then, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks, i will open the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 24
third, when the q- and-a is complete, each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes each. %$* 24
fourth, during the closing arguments, ballot boxes will be passed around for voting. %$* 24
you all have your tickets, i assume, and if you don’t have your tickets with the “for” and “against” on it, just raise your hand, some of the folks in the aisle have extra tickets. %$* 24
ballot stuffing is discouraged. %$* 24
also, there are pencils and paper for people who want to jot down questions while the debate is going on. %$* 24
last, after the final closing statement is made, i will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day. %$* 24
for the motion, let me introduce our panelists. %$* 24
author and editor of the paris review and a long-time staff writer for the new yorker, philip gourevitch. %$* 24
prolific british author, journalist, literary critic, contrarian intellectual and subject of a new yorker profile just last week, christopher hitchens. %$* 24
pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the philadelphia daily news, signe wilkinson. %$* 24
against the motion, british scholar of jewish history and research professor in “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” history at royal holloway, university of london, david cesarani. %$* 24
executive director of the american society for muslim advancement, daisy khan. %$* 24
author, professor of law at georgetown university law center and activist scholar, mari matsuda. %$* 24
so let’s begin. %$* 24
signe wilkinson, you’re first. %$* 24
thank you, and thank you, jeffrey. %$* 25
since world war iii almost started over a bunch of cartoons, i want to thank this evening’s organizers for including a cartoonist—two, if you include christopher hitchens. %$* 25
150 years ago, the tammany hall politician boss tweed responded to an offensive cartoon against him with the famous line, “stop them damn pictures.” the reason we’re here tonight, is that these days, everyone wants to stop them damn pictures, if the damn pictures in question hurt their feelings or the feelings of their tribe. %$* 25
when i say everyone, i mean everyone. %$* 25
early in my career, i penned this badly-drawn cartoon, “fundamental sex ed—does the stork bring aids and herpes too? %$* 25
” i expected calls from the fundamentalist ministers in the area, but no, i got calls from schoolteachers saying, “not all teachers are fat, old and carry rollers! %$* 25
” schoolteachers aren’t alone. %$* 25
in the course “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” of my 25 years as a paid professional offender, i have been attacked for criticizing people of color, people without much color, people of guns, people of excessive weight, people with trial lawyers, and armenian people. %$* 25
this is a partial list, and certainly doesn’t begin to cover people of religion, who are the touchiest people of all. %$* 25
unfortunately for the pious, americans like their damn cartoons and they always have. %$* 25
in nine—in 1872, joseph keppler drew this tribute to religion, which as you can see on the lower left, offensive caricatures jews, and on the right, offensively caricatures catholics. %$* 25
but wait—in the middle, he offensively caricatures episcopalians, mormons, baptists, presbyterians, and even henry ward beecher, the new age minister and adulterer of his age. %$* 25
if we had more time, i’d show more cartoons. %$* 25
so, when newcomers arrive on our shores, with their deeply held religious beliefs, they should be prepared to get in line to have those beliefs scrutinized, as they did in the mid-1800s when new york city, like denmark today, was awash with poor foreign immigrants who came with their robed clerics and demands for separate schools. %$* 25
these were of course catholics, not muslims, but some american cartoonists reacted just the way the danes did. %$* 25
in 1871, the father of american cartoonists, thomas nast, drew this. %$* 25
“the american river ganges.” the hats of the reptilian bishops crawling ashore “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” have menacing crocodile teeth—certainly the precursors of a turban as a bomb. %$* 25
usually, my colleagues don’t go out of their way to kick a clergyman. %$* 25
however, when the clergy ask for special privileges, demand special tax cuts, or are just especially misbehaving, we take notice. %$* 25
this pat oliphant, “the running of the altar boys” %$* 25
you’re cutting into my time, stop laughing. %$* 25
it was embraced by many lay catholics, but bitterly denounced by official catholicism. %$* 25
note to church leaders—if you don’t want your clerics ridiculed as child abusers, make sure they don’t abuse children. %$* 25
had americans been able to see the danish cartoons, they would’ve noted that they too were not just gratuitous attacks on the faithful. %$* 25
one was making fun of the idea that after blowing up innocent people, suicide bombers would be rewarded with virgins in heaven. %$* 25
if you can’t make fun of that, what can you make fun of. %$* 25
what really enraged believers wasn’t that mohammed was pictured but that he was pictured negatively. %$* 25
to test the point, at the height of the controversy i put mohammed in this cartoon, “the big fat book of offensive religious cartoons.” he’s third from the right, flanked by jesus and god, and a few other laughing deities. %$* 25
no one protested this because no one “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” cared about mohammed being drawn as jolly and benign. %$* 25
however, i have been picketed without putting mohammed in a cartoon. %$* 25
“radical islam sponsors the miss muslim world contest—miss illiteracy, miss can’t vote, miss waiting to be stoned.” when i say picketed, i mean picketed, including %$* 25
including by one of my daughter’s high school history teachers. %$* 25
but muslims aren’t alone in their selective outrage. %$* 25
my jewish readers were okay with the drawing with the star of david that was pro-israel, but roasted me for one that criticized a local jewish senator who was attacking his opponent for being anti- semitic. %$* 25
critics said that the star of david was off-limits— unless, apparently, it was used to make a point that they agreed with. %$* 25
what critics of offensive cartoons forget is that every time i exercise my free speech, my readers exercise theirs, swiftly and loudly. %$* 25
for that last little sketch with the star of david, our paper received and printed weeks of vilifying letters. %$* 25
the anti- defamation league denounced me, i was called a nazi, and the senator’s son helpfully suggested to my editors how they could better use my talents. %$* 25
one reader wrote that i was worthy of hustler magazine, which at my age i take as something of a compliment. %$* 25
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” speaking of hustler, its publisher, larry flynt, is the patron saint of cartoonists. %$* 25
when hustler ran a spoof claiming that jerry falwell’s first sexual encounter was with his mother in an outhouse the right reverend falwell did the christian thing, and sued, in a case that went to the supreme court in 1987.the unanimous decision was written by that famed pinko degenerate, william rehnquist, who wrote that “even though the spoof was outrageous, outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse is inherently subjective,” and that “the court has long protected free speech, even speech that offends the audience.” so the offended are left with the same option i use—free speech. %$* 25
they can and do write, call, picket, boycott, and draw their own cartoons, but in america, thank god and the constitution, they can’t claim special privileges and stop them damn pictures. %$* 25
thank you. %$* 25
next, against the proposition, mari matsuda. %$* 24
thank you, jeffrey, and thank you, signe, for making us laugh and making my job so hard. %$* 26
it’s really not fair to put me after the cartoonist, but i volunteered to go first. %$* 26
i’m sorry, i didn’t bring cartoons, and i’m not going to make you laugh. %$* 26
i stand before you a censored person. %$* 26
under american law, there are several “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” things that i could not say. %$* 26
i could not attempt to sell you snake oil as a cure for cancer. %$* 26
i couldn’t tell you secrets that i know that could make you millions of dollars when the stock market opens tomorrow. %$* 26
i couldn’t tell a lie that would harm the reputation of any of the people on this stage. %$* 26
and i could not yell “fire! %$* 26
” in a believable way that would cause a stampede for the exits. %$* 26
this point is the lawyer’s point. %$* 26
in a complex society, law necessarily mediates between competing interests. %$* 26
speech is one of those interests, and it is profoundly valuable. %$* 26
but when speech comes up against other interests that are also valuable, we have no choice. %$* 26
we mediate, we draw lines, we balance. %$* 26
this is what we do. %$* 26
my second point is a humanitarian point—that words are weapons. %$* 26
they can assault, wound degrade, exclude, and incite harm of stunning proportions. %$* 26
i am a citizen born of the last century, one that had genocide right in its center. %$* 26
that century will forever color my view of the harm that human beings are capable of. %$* 26
propaganda is not a parlor game and rhetoric is not recreation. %$* 26
words have consequences. %$* 26
i take words seriously enough to make them my vocation, and i believe that some words should remain unspoken. %$* 26
my third claim is that i am a constitutionalist and a civil libertarian. %$* 26
i believe that individuals exist prior to the state and that the state must remain accountable to its citizens. %$* 26
thus i am allied with “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” my opponents in this debate in their healthy distrust of limits on speech. %$* 26
indeed, if we had time to discuss the entire history of suppression of dissent in this country, my guess is that all six of us here on this stage would agree that the record contains many deplorable episodes. %$* 26
so why do i diverge on the particular question of assaultive speech and urge you to vote no tonight? %$* 26
it is precisely because i value speech. %$* 26
as i see it, there are two main reasons for the first amendment or for our protection of speech. %$* 26
one is simply that we respect individual choices. %$* 26
each of us is sovereign over ourselves and entitled to express the cry of our own heart. %$* 26
the second reason is functional. %$* 26
we need democracy in order for our individual selves to thrive, and we need speech in order for democracy to thrive. %$* 26
democracy requires that each and every individual speak, think, study, know, and participate in self- governance. %$* 26
when hate speech and propaganda instill beliefs of inherent inferiority, the very things that the first amendment is intended to protect are at risk. %$* 26
when racist invective keeps you away from a public hearing, as has happened, when sexual taunting keeps you away from a job, as has happened, democracy’s prerequisites of mutual exchange and participation are gone. %$* 26
my students tell “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” me, you’ve got to give examples, people don’t understand without examples. %$* 26
so i’ll give you one from the asian-american community. %$* 26
right after the last major san francisco earthquake, the big one, there was a public debate about whether to rebuild certain sections of the freeway. %$* 26
one off-ramp in particular that led into chinatown was of concern to the residents of that community, and they turned out for a public hearing. %$* 26
well, the white aryan resistance also decided to do a show of force at that hearing, in their full nazi stormtrooper regalia. %$* 26
this is pre-internet so instead of a web site they had a hotline you could call to hear racist invective and find out who had testified at that hearing. %$* 26
many of the elders and merchants in that community would come out to testify, and it was their first experience with participation in the democratic process. %$* 26
they were frightened away, and were very unlikely to come out again as the debate continued around this issue of political discourse. %$* 26
if you think about why we disallow defamation, or impose legal penalties for it, it’s because reputation is part of the self, and it’s part of the self that’s needed to participate equally in the democratic conversation. %$* 26
if you lose standing in the community you lose liberty. %$* 26
the freedom to move about as a respected person, to speak credibly, to join your fellow citizens in this grand social contract that we call democracy. %$* 26
your reputation is “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” valuable, and thus we will restrain speech when it takes your reputation from you. %$* 26
i submit that there are forms of assaultive speech that have very much the same effect. %$* 26
i’ve asked for 30 years why we penalize someone who calls a doctor a quack, but we won’t penalize someone who says that by race, the doctor is inherently worthless and properly subject to extermination. %$* 26
i haven’t received an answer. %$* 26
if you believe, as i do, that unbridled freedom to wound with words and to incite through propaganda can harm the very freedom that we intend to protect by protecting speech, then i suggest that you vote against the proposition. %$* 26
the other side will tell you we can’t start down that path of deciding which speech is acceptable, or we become trapped in the censorship business. %$* 26
this is a rhetorical move that lawyers call the slippery slope. %$* 26
what the other side will not tell you is that we are already on the slippery slope of tolerating censorship of certain forms of speech, including libel, fraud, copyright infringement, conversations in restraint of trade. %$* 26
there is no easy and absolute way out. %$* 26
we do have to decide when, where, and how we will limit speech. %$* 26
the call of the question here uses the word “offensive.” but let me make clear that none of us would be engaged in this debate if we were just talking about table manners, or humorous insults with “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” political purpose, the right to offend that signe wilkinson is talking about. %$* 26
if we say that we are closing the door, taking an absolutist position, giving a free license to those who would use words to assault, we’re doing much more than just allowing political cartoons, which i think should be protected absolutely, we can discern how to do that under our legal system. %$* 26
but what i’m really getting at is words that are intended to wound, and to stop people from equal participation in society. %$* 26
if i spit on your shoe, you can sue me for that, it’s called a battery. %$* 26
there are words i could use that would have the same effect on your psyche, your personhood, or your ability to move freely. %$* 26
yet if you vote for this proposition you’re saying that that form of assault is allowed. %$* 26
it happens in this city and elsewhere in our country. %$* 26
thank you, vote no. %$* 26
philip gourevitch. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
extraordinary how people who want to silence public speech won’t shut up. %$* 27
we’re faced tonight with people who want to stop cartooning but who make a caricature of the concept of free speech. %$* 27
they are not here to discuss free speech, they are here to discuss their deep conviction that speech is not free and therefore should not be free. %$* 27
that is essentially what the previous speaker said, she said there is no free speech, let’s be real, and therefore there should be no free speech and we should simply start restricting it endlessly. %$* 27
since we are being cartooned as the monstrous side, let me begin with a monstrous image. %$* 27
in northern uganda for the last 15 to 20 years, there has been a movement known as the lord’s resistance army. %$* 27
it practices its warfare in the name of god, and what it does when it dislikes the speech that is being made is that it cuts off the lips of the citizens who are speaking and it puts padlocks through punctured holes in their lips and shuts them. %$* 27
i’m afraid that i’m very much unable to picture these people doing that, but it’s very clear to me that that is what they wish to do. %$* 27
i will return to this image at the end, but that is the image that clearly you must bear in mind as you, the jury tonight, vote on the question of whether we shall be permitted to speak or whether we shall be inclined to silence anybody in whom we find offense. %$* 27
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” that is what they are saying, and who are they to judge what is offensive? %$* 27
surely you have different ideas, surely we all have different ideas, and yet somehow, the concept of offense is being proposed by the other side as some sort of universal measure of civilization rather than the opposite. %$* 27
but one point of agreement that we have is that speech is fiercely powerful, and can be intensely dangerous. %$* 27
i spent some time reporting from rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide there. %$* 27
the previous speaker referred to genocide, and one of the most striking things in rwanda is that in a great deal of the genocide was incited by public speech, radio speech, incitement through words. %$* 27
the words were used as hate speech, which we will find the other side thinks should be censored because it is dangerous. %$* 27
the hate speech said, invariably, kill the minority, the tutsis. %$* 27
they didn’t always say it directly, they would use euphemisms and the euphemisms would be phrases like “do your work. %$* 27
clear the bush. %$* 27
do not let a weed escape the blade.” these were phrases that were well understood in the historical context and they were clearly hate speech, there’s no ambiguity about it. %$* 27
those people have been tried and convicted for inciting mass murder in their country. %$* 27
the problem there was not free speech for haters. %$* 27
it was that this was the officially sanctioned “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” speech by people who prohibited sanity from being free speech. %$* 27
anybody who protested against the genocide was silenced as offensive. %$* 27
offensive speech, my goodness. %$* 27
that hutus and tutsis should live side by side in comity, that they should allow each other to exist—how offensive. %$* 27
let’s silence them. %$* 27
let’s murder them. %$* 27
let us have official speech. %$* 27
that was the position. %$* 27
that is the position which—yes, ma’am. %$* 27
“slippery slope.” it’s not a slippery slope, it’s a greased precipice over which they wish to push you. %$* 27
once you start to say that racist or blasphemous speech is somehow or other offensive, you’re immediately on the quick descent towards book-burning. %$* 27
the books that you wish to burn are the books that include, let’s say, huck finn, where racists are used in possibly the 19th century’s noblest portrait of a black man in america. %$* 27
blasphemous speech is used by ahab. %$* 27
most people who are burning books are of course too illiterate to notice. %$* 27
but let’s focus on the facts. %$* 27
they consistently elevate idiotic speech, like holocaust denial, to a greatly important role by saying, lets us illegalize it, challenge it in courts, give these people a tremendous platform, and prove that they’re wrong %$* 27
when no sane person can possibly suspect that this is serious history. %$* 27
so we’re going to have to elevate them in order to silence them, “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” rather than to ignore them, to discuss it with them. %$* 27
i would like to quote to you a short passage from david cesarani in which he wrote, “celebrating austria’s law criminalizing holocaust denial.” this was in the guardian. %$* 27
“thanks to the internet,” he claims, “it is virtually impossible to stop the dissemination of laws and propaganda these days. %$* 27
the classical arguments of freedom of speech drawn from voltaire and mill are redundant.” so we have an anti-enlightenment argument very strongly stated. %$* 27
“they addressed small, literate elites at a time when the means of reproduction were relatively few and easily controlled, when it was easy to contend that in a contest between truth and falsehood held among reasonable men, lies would be exposed and driven from the public sphere. %$* 27
but the internet is awash with falsehood and bigotry. %$* 27
good ideas and beautiful truths coexist with trash and outright evil. %$* 27
heaven forfend that bad ideas should be out there. %$* 27
amid this anarchy,” he says, “all that decent people can do is agree to reasonable limits on what can be said and set down legal markers in an attempt to preserve a democratic, civilized and tolerant society.” that’s what he says. %$* 27
i say, who gives him the right to set up a chair in the antechambers of my mind and judge what i’m allowed to say and what i’m allowed to think. %$* 27
is that what you want? %$* 27
is that who you want? %$* 27
how does it avail the “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” cause of civilization, sir, to fight brownshirts with brownshirt tactics? %$* 27
i would like to know that. %$* 27
what i share with this pious trinity of the opposing team is a deeply pessimistic view of human history. %$* 27
i do not believe that if you let people run around loose they’re going to have nice ideas about each other and behave nicely towards each other, because that’s not what they do. %$* 27
their response is to cut off their lips and to clamp on a padlock. %$* 27
to decide who should be in the sanhedrin of the mind and who should be in the sanhedrin of the soul, sit around and tell you what you’re allowed to say and what you’re allowed to think. %$* 27
they do not understand that there is not agreement about this. %$* 27
they seem to assume that somehow or other it will always prevail. %$* 27
yes, they say times change, sometimes it’s allowed to be racist, sometimes it’s allowed to be anti-racist. %$* 27
sometimes we silence the people who are pro-jewish, sometimes we silence the people who are anti-muslim, but that’s okay because we’re just rolling with the times, and we’re always going to let the people who we sort of think are civilized speak in the name of civility. %$* 27
i think that this is extremely dangerous. %$* 27
i return, that while they conclude that we must accept that because speech is limited we must put ourselves in charge of limiting it, that we are dealing here really with a case of lesser evils. %$* 27
the question before us “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” tonight, simply put and simply stated in the proposition that we were given, is that freedom of speech must include a license to offend. %$* 27
i would expand that license to blaspheme, and i would not call it a license. %$* 27
they speak of it as a license, they think all speech is a license and that all speech should be licensed because most speech should be restricted before it is licensed. %$* 27
then we decide, okay, we’ll let this out, we’ll let that out, we’ll let this out, we’ll let that out. %$* 27
i think that that’s a very, very, very dangerous precipice on which they want to perch us. %$* 27
i do not trust them, even though i think that they’re probably more trustable than most. %$* 27
but what is to say that they will stay in charge of that speech? %$* 27
what is to say that we will not fall into the hands of somebody we don’t trust? %$* 27
what is to say that the message that one day seems somewhat sane, the next day becomes to kill, and that the people who say let us not kill are silenced in the name of reasonable speech and in the name of civilization to moderate that. %$* 27
i remind you one last time as you go to vote, if you believe in chopping off lips and clamping on padlocks on open mouths, there’s your troika. %$* 27
that was philip gourevitch. %$* 24
next, against the proposition, david cesarani. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
right. %$* 28
well— first of all i want to thank philip for repeating verbatim something i wrote in the guardian. %$* 28
i stand by every word, and it’s saved me a bit of time. %$* 28
i do think it is possible for reasonable people, like the people in this room, to decide what is offensive and what is dangerous. %$* 28
mari, in a very modest and less flamboyant way, tried to set out what it is that is offensive, and what is dangerous. %$* 28
i don’t think it’s really necessary to bother to respond to a very foolish idea of what this side of the house is advocating. %$* 28
we are not advocating cutting off people’s lips, we are not even advocating repealing the first amendment. %$* 28
we’re not even advocating special laws that will have people banged up in prison for saying things that we don’t like. %$* 28
we’re just asking you, and i’m asking this as someone who’s british, to just reflect with a little humility on american society and culture. %$* 28
to reflect while holding in mind the fact that, in most other liberal democracies, there are modest constraints on what can be said and written. %$* 28
for good reason, too. %$* 28
most international conventions that set out freedoms also include constraints on the freedom of expression, most notably the european convention on human rights. %$* 28
the reason is that the european convention on human rights “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” that was passed in 1950 was framed against the background of genocide, mass murder, persecution, and totalitarianism in europe. %$* 28
men and women had seen the drip-drip effect there of hate speech, words that demeaned and degraded, and resolved that freedom of speech could no longer be considered an absolute right. %$* 28
it was a right, a fundamental element of liberty. %$* 28
but it was not absolutely overriding because it was open to abuse. %$* 28
it was abused in europe, it’s abused now, and i’d say it’s actually abused here. %$* 28
philip gourevitch said rather mockingly that we came to you to ask you to get real. %$* 28
i’m going to repeat that. %$* 28
get real. %$* 28
there was a little article in the guardian which amused me. %$* 28
apparently, a few days ago, a meeting to be addressed by a colleague of mine, tony judd, a historian who i rate enormously highly, was canceled because of a phone call from abe foxman. %$* 28
i don’t know if abe foxman is in this audience now, but he’s obviously a very powerful man. %$* 28
just with the one of his voice he can have meetings canceled and freedom of expression curtailed. %$* 28
i think that is an abuse of power. %$* 28
i think that it is very dangerous that people can phone up organizations and have meetings canceled because they don’t like, not what the speaker is actually going to address, but other things that he has spoken about. %$* 28
tony judd has written some things about israel that abe didn’t like, so abe phoned up the polish consulate and said, do “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” you really want to have that guy speak on your premises? %$* 28
now, get real. %$* 28
you have constraints on freedom of expression in this great country. %$* 28
what we are asking you to do is to reflect with a little bit of humility on how you want those constraints to be exercised by the most powerful, the most ruthless, the ones with the biggest bank balances, the ones with the most votes. %$* 28
or do you want to have a public debate about how you protect those who are weak, who are vulnerable, who are defenseless, who are marginal, and who are often abused in the mass media or in work settings, as mari mentioned. %$* 28
i think the real choice is not whether you’re in favor of absolute freedom of speech or constraints on freedom of speech tonight. %$* 28
it’s whether you’re going to be realistic, or whether you’re going to be smug and hypocritical and walk out of this hall thinking this is the land of the free, land of the brave, no such things as restrictions on freedom of speech here, and we don’t want to be lectured about that by some limey. %$* 28
whether you’re going to recite to yourselves happily, milton, locke, mill! %$* 28
— without actually knowing very much about what milton, locke and mill had to say about freedom of expression. %$* 28
for none of these men was freedom of expression a good in itself. %$* 28
it was always a means to an end. %$* 28
for milton, who didn’t like catholics, it was to expose the fallacies “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” of catholicism prior to crushing and eradicating them. %$* 28
for locke, it was simply a means to good governments. %$* 28
for mill, it was to advance education and truth. %$* 28
as soon as mill considered the possibility of uneducated mass audiences, he panicked and resiled. %$* 28
he went back on everything that he’d said about unlimited freedom of speech. %$* 28
i’m going to read out what john stuart mill had to say. %$* 28
“acts of whatever kind, which without justifiable cause do harm to others, may be—and, in the more important cases, absolutely require to be—controlled by the unfavorable sentiments and when needful by the active interference of mankind.” he included speech acts, and the notorious, wonderful example he gave is the folly of allowing a man in a time of famine to inveigh against grain dealers outside the home of a grain dealer before a public that is hungry, ill-educated, and not terribly reasonable. %$* 28
that unfortunately is the state of our society today. %$* 28
there are a lot of people who are unreasonable, who are ill- educated, who are angry about this and that, and there are plenty of people who want to stir the pot and who want to incite them. %$* 28
john stuart mill, who understood the perils of mass society, also understood that we are no longer conducting this discussion amongst a nice, homogeneous elite, but we are having to deal with huge numbers of people in divided, conflicted “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” societies. %$* 28
i think—and i’m an optimist, unlike philip gourevitch—that we have it within our power, thinking and working together, to agree on what can and cannot be said, should and should not be said, to avoid conflict, to avoid people standing outside the homes of grain merchants, and inveighing against their business. %$* 28
this is what timothy garton ashe wrote recently in the guardian. %$* 28
“we need to wake up to the seriousness of the danger”—the danger to freedom of speech, freedom of expression. %$* 28
“i repeat, this is one of the greatest challenges to freedom in our time. %$* 28
we need a debate about what the law should and should not allow to be said or written. %$* 28
even mill did not suggest that everyone should be allowed to say anything anytime anywhere. %$* 28
we also need a debate about what it’s prudent and wise to say in a globalized world where people of different cultures live so close together, like roommates separated only by a thin curtain. %$* 28
there is a frontier of prudence and wisdom which lies beyond the one that should be enforced by law.” we are, on this side of the house, advocating that you think about where that boundary of prudence and wisdom should lie. %$* 28
we’re not repealing the laws, we’re not passing them, we want you to reflect. %$* 28
thank you. %$* 28
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 28
that was david cesarani against the proposition. %$* 24
now for the proposition, christopher hitchens. %$* 24
well now, mr. %$* 29
chairman, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters %$* 29
if i may say, comrades and friends. %$* 29
okay, then, “fire! %$* 29
” it’s not that crowded a theater, but “fire! %$* 29
” again. %$* 29
you see? %$* 29
if you remember the appalling judgment actually rendered by mr. %$* 29
justice oliver wendell holmes in that case, he was comparing the action that i’ve just imitated and parodied to the action of a group of yiddish-speaking socialists who gave out a leaflet, in yiddish only, opposing mr. %$* 29
wilson’s war and actually calling attention as they were to a major conflagration raging in europe in which they did not think the united states should become involved. %$* 29
be very, very, very careful when people give you arguments from authority or tradition that suggest that free speech can be limited by higher authorities like the sainted holmes, because that’s what you’ll get. %$* 29
the end of it is a group of yiddish-speaking radicals told they can’t hand out a leaflet in yiddish on a major question of the day. %$* 29
that’s always how it will end, no matter how high-mindedly or creepily or sinisterly it’s presented to you. %$* 29
my “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” favorite crowded-theater story is actually about the terrible broadway production of the diary of anne frank. %$* 29
some people may remember this, it’s a production famous for its longueurs. %$* 29
in the third act as the german soldiers came pounding on the door and stamping into the parlor, someone in the front row shouted, “she’s in the attic! %$* 29
” call me old-fashioned if you will, ladies and gentlemen, but as you will see i don’t think a joke is really a joke unless it’s at somebody’s expense. %$* 29
now if you’re thick-skinned and broad-backed enough to take that, i might have a bit more for you. %$* 29
the real question, utterly, utterly dodged by david in his shady remarks, is this. %$* 29
who’s going to decide. %$* 29
we’ve already found that oliver wendell holmes isn’t competent on the point. %$* 29
who will you appoint. %$* 29
who will be the one who says, i know exactly where the limits should be, i know how far you can go and i know when you’ve gone too far, and i’ll decide that. %$* 29
who do you think—who do you know—who have you heard of, who have you read about in history to whom you’d give that job? %$* 29
i always say, just for this evening, i wouldn’t give it to anyone who’s spoken so far on the other side. %$* 29
now, i sure do know a bit about milton and quite a lot about thomas paine as well. %$* 29
mr. %$* 29
paine actually updated and i think improved john milton’s areopagitica which is the classic “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” case for free expression. %$* 29
those of you who know areopagitica and paine’s commentary on it will know that it recommends free speech in this way—not for you, but for the people you are listening to and the people whose comments you hope to hear in return, for your own education, for your own enlightenment and for your own elucidation. %$* 29
as mr. %$* 29
paine says, commenting on milton, one of the vices of those who would repress the opinions of others is they make themselves prisoners of their own opinions, because they deny themselves the rights and the means of changing them. %$* 29
should this not be as plain as could be? %$* 29
the free interplay of ideas is not something that those of us who wish to speak or unload our opinions insist upon for that sake, it’s because we want to hear what is said in response, however unwelcome it may be to us. %$* 29
thus the defense of any one opinion or form of expression is a defense of all of them. %$* 29
the classic statement in modern times of this, in my view, would be aryeh neier’s book defending my enemy where he describes the decision of the american civil liberties union, of which i am a supporter, to take the case of the american nazi party and its right to parade swastikas through the town of skokie, illinois, a favorite retirement community for those who’d survived the final solution. %$* 29
the aclu lost a lot of “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” members on that proposition but we did the right thing by the first amendment. %$* 29
in the book he has a wonderful extract from robert bolt’s play a man for all seasons which some of you will have seen at least in celluloid form, where if you recall, sir thomas more is talking to one of the witch-hunters and prosecutors. %$* 29
he says, “so you’d cut a road through the laws, would you, to get after the devil? %$* 29
” the witch-hunter and prosecutor says, “i’d cut down every law in england to do that.” thomas more says, “that’s worth knowing. %$* 29
and when the devil turned round to meet you and had you at bay, where would you look for shelter, mr. %$* 29
prosecutor, the laws all being flat and cut down? %$* 29
where would you turn then? %$* 29
” it’s impossible ever to think of infringing the right of anyone else to free speech without arranging, in a sense calling in advance for this to happen to you too. %$* 29
it’s quite different, obviously different, from any question of information. %$* 29
information may be classified and information may be copyrighted. %$* 29
every word said on that score by the first speaker on the other side was a complete waste of her breath, because it’s not what we’re meant to talk about. %$* 29
we’re meant to talk about the expression of opinion and conviction, not breach of copyright or leaking of classified information. %$* 29
if we’d wanted to talk about that, we would’ve phrased the motion differently. %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” there’ve been some bad signs lately, a lot of slippage in what i would have thought was the pedantic obviousness of the points i’ve just made. %$* 29
the imprisonment of david irving in austria for a thought crime, for the possibility that he might while in austria have given a speech saying that he doubts some of the verdicts of history on what i call the final solution. %$* 29
there’s no victim to this crime. %$* 29
the austrian consul called me up weeping with self-pity when i pointed this out in the wall street journal and said, “but we thought finally austria would be popular. %$* 29
we had something that you would all like! %$* 29
so gut muttlich.” that the land that survives on the myth that hitler was german and beethoven was viennese, that had waldheim as its chancellor and has jorg heider as a member of its government, can revenge itself on a defenseless british academic and jail him is a standing disgrace. %$* 29
there are attempts to extend similar thought-crime laws to other topics of historical importance, the most depressing of which recently is the provisional decision of the french parliament to criminalize discussion of the armenian massacre, considered by me and most others to have been a planned genocide in the early part of the 20th century. %$* 29
now you couldn’t take the contrary view. %$* 29
you couldn’t for example argue, as you can, that actually in the “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” provinces of turkey where russian forces were not engaged, armenians were not massacred. %$* 29
in other words, it could be that it was partly an act of war as well as an act of ethnocide. %$* 29
speculations of this kind would now be actually in peril. %$* 29
the law on which it’s modeled, the loi gayssot, which criminalizes in france discussion of the holocaust as well, is named for the french stalinist, monsieur gayssot, who sponsored it and whose spirit, and the spirit of whose hero is present in all of these and other such discussions. %$* 29
i stipulate that all of these things, when they happen, offend me very much. %$* 29
i’m offended by them, i want you to understand. %$* 29
it goes to the core of what i do and what i am. %$* 29
the first amendment doesn’t just provide me with a living, the first amendment is my life. %$* 29
when it’s infringed, i am offended, i have claimed the right to be offended. %$* 29
i do not claim the right to go burn down someone else’s place of worship, to threaten their religion with violent reprisal, to picket their home, to publish their name in threatening terms on the internet—i won’t do any of that. %$* 29
it doesn’t mean i can’t be offended but it does mean that i’m even more offended by those who claim the right, not just to be offended, but to seek violent reprisal, as is so vividly and currently being done by the votaries of the prophet mohammed, in recent instances which i have no time at all to inform you but “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” about which you already know and to which i hope i will be asked to return. %$* 29
thanks very much. %$* 29
that was christopher hitchens for the proposition. %$* 24
against the proposition now, daisy khan. %$* 24
distinguished guests, philip, signe, and christopher. %$* 30
first of all, i think it was divine intervention that christopher was not allowed to continue. %$* 30
i think christopher should nominate me to decide who will decide, because really, christopher, i’m quite fair. %$* 30
i definitely do not believe in cutting off lips, and i hate padlocks. %$* 30
so i want to begin by saying that the motion of today, where the freedom of expression must include the license to offend, is in a sense really a moot point and a moot question. %$* 30
i hope that all of you here today will consider rejecting and throwing it out. %$* 30
the freedom we have to express ourselves does in fact enable us to offend. %$* 30
christopher is doing it all the time, in his own sweet way. %$* 30
in fact, one can even say that sometimes it is necessary to offend, and for good cause. %$* 30
the appropriate question to ask today is whether freedom of expression is absolute and limitless, “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” or should it come with some social responsibility. %$* 30
in the us we do have a value system that undergirds our free speech. %$* 30
salient within the system is the value of fighting the suppression of truth. %$* 30
let’s face it. %$* 30
the reason why we’re having this debate today, is because a number of recent events, such as the danish cartoon and pope benedict’s remarks on islam, have brought this issue to the forefront. %$* 30
i’m mentioning these examples to frame the current affairs context for our discussion here today. %$* 30
there is no doubt in my mind that there are many issues, many suppressed truths, particularly within the muslim world, that very badly need to be brought to light. %$* 30
i do not need to go through the litany of problems faced, for instance, by women in various parts of the muslim world and the rest of the global south, all of which need to be discussed. %$* 30
there’s also no doubt in my mind that when it comes to religion, muslims need to engage in a very honest and open discussion about many of the values that they espouse. %$* 30
whether they are in accordance with the teachings of islam is another matter entirely. %$* 30
there are, however, certain kinds of speech that undermine the very values that liberty of expression is meant to advance. %$* 30
take for example the infamous danish cartoon protest. %$* 30

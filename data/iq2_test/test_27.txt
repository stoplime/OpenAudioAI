do you-- %$* 13
do you care? %$* 13
i'm not being facetious. %$* 13
in terms of your saying, you know, maybe some people will be harmed, the current theme, but for the larger sake, the system should largely operate as it is for the-- %$* 13
oh,-- %$* 70
future. %$* 13
do you care that there are harms to somebody who-- %$* 13
in the category you just described. %$* 13
as far as i'm concerned, in our discussion of this, it's not, frankly, about individual individual harm, so long as it's not invidious, so long as it's not, trying to stick it to a group because of group membership. %$* 70
what we should be interested in are policies that overall will advance-- %$* 70
but-- %$* 13
the purposes of these institutions. %$* 70
but the angst in all of this comes from the fact that everyone experiences it as an individual on all sides-- %$* 13
uh-huh. %$* 70
of the equation. %$* 13
so why do you discount-- %$* 13
i think i may be putting too many words in your mouth by saying, "discount." but why do you diminish the impact on the individual? %$* 13
oh, i wouldn't diminish it so the person who's feeling this angst-- %$* 70
i understand that they're feeling the angst. %$* 70
they ought not. %$* 70
the fact of the matter is that we have all sorts of social programs that disadvantage people in various ways. %$* 70
we have all sorts of things that happen, you know, when-- %$* 70
we have all sorts of things that happen and that disadvantage people or, you know, when people face disaster in the middle of the united states-- %$* 70
let's say that there's been a flood, and uncle sam comes to me and says, you know, "we want you to pay more in taxes to help these people out," that's a political decision that's being made. %$* 70
i might not like it. %$* 70
i might feel that the pinch is being put on me. %$* 70
i don't think that's a good thing, but i'd do it because i'm part of the united states of america and all people - - %$* 70
hold it, all people ought to contribute to social missions that are worthwhile. %$* 70
i'm-- %$* 13
social missions-- %$* 70
i'm making the mistake of starting to be the debater with you, and i only was looking for clarification to your question, so i'm going to stop but let the other side come back. %$* 13
the social mission of trying to overcome racial injustice in america is a social mission that ought to enlist all comers. %$* 70
i think we'd like to make-- %$* 69
rich sander. %$* 13
two short comments. %$* 69
one is that we've generally disavowed the idea that we ought to make contributions based on race. %$* 69
and it's this very narrow focus on race that leads us into this bind because the logical implication of having large racial preferences for blacks, hispanics, and american indians is that there should be a large racial penalty for asian-americans. %$* 69
and i don't think it exists everywhere but it exists in enough schools to be really repugnant. %$* 69
and if we focused affirmative action more on pipeline questions, more on "who is having difficulty getting access? %$* 69
" then there would be dramatically more focus in this whole discussion on class, which is generally ignored by universities and not on race. %$* 69
and if we were focusing more on individual characteristics, we wouldn't have this bind of treating asian-americans the way we used to treat jewish americans. %$* 69
gail? %$* 13
i guess i don't have a whole lot to add-- %$* 68
okay, then i'm-- %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 13
a little bit. %$* 68
no, no, i thought you were waiting for something to say, and we have very little time, so i'd like-- %$* 13
very quickly-- %$* 13
because i'd like to get in one more question. %$* 13
very quickly on this, i think that this is a thorny and difficult question although i agree with what my colleague, randy, said about breaking down asian-americans as a group. %$* 71
but my starting place in dealing with this question includes two points. %$* 71
one is that nobody, nobody has an absolute right to be admitted to these institutions. %$* 71
keep that in mind. %$* 71
we're choosing among people who are qualified and they have different backgrounds, different qualifications or levels of qualifications. %$* 71
but nobody has an absolute right. %$* 71
secondly, i point to what bok and bowen said in "the shape of the river," the analogy they gave-- %$* 71
you know, you're in a parking lot, you know, of a big mall during the holiday season and you see the handicapped spot. %$* 71
you can't find a spot. %$* 71
you see that spot. %$* 71
you say, "you know what? %$* 71
if that spot wasn't there and they weren't giving that preference to handicapped people, i'd have been in that store and i'd be out of there.‚Äù and you wouldn't in all likelihood. %$* 71
there aren't enough, i contend, african- americans at these selective institutions to really account for the large numbers of others who don't get in and think that they didn't get in because african-americans got in. %$* 71
one more question, right down front, thanks. %$* 13
mic's coming from your left side. %$* 13
my question is for gail. %$* 73
you mentioned that-- %$* 73
just tell us your name, please. %$* 13
oh, my name is rina johnson you mentioned that your ideal system would be if the universities gave students information and then they would-- %$* 73
i think the term you used was "do the right thing"-- %$* 73
on an individual level, does that mean maybe going to a less prestigious institution with fewer resources and job opportunities just so that you maybe perform better in comparison to your classmates? %$* 73
i mean, i didn't say that was my ideal system. %$* 68
i'm not really quite sure what my ideal is. %$* 68
but what i did say is that, yes, if schools were to disclose what the success rate for students with that particular set of academic indicators and students were able to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to take the risk, i think that's a tremendous improvement over what we have now. %$* 68
and, in fact, that's exactly what the u.s.commission on civil rights recommended that law schools do. %$* 68
and i voted for that report. %$* 68
and what's tragic i think is that schools don't want to disclose it. %$* 68
they don't want to tell students, i am not at all confident that even though as a group we're able to come to a possible settlement. %$* 68
i don't think you're going to get harvard or any other law school to sign on to it. %$* 68
and that's a tragedy, i think. %$* 68
i just got the signal that we can stretch for one more question. %$* 13
sir, right down-- %$* 13
over here, thanks. %$* 13
make it a doozy. %$* 13
hi. %$* 74
my name is alex sullivan. %$* 74
so, it seems to me that this side has made the case that affirmative action, in its current state, is ineffective, or does more harm than good. %$* 74
and i think they've been quite compelling to that end. %$* 74
so, my question would be to the opposition, do you think that affirmative action, if we accept this motion that-- %$* 74
as they put it, that in its current state, it does more harm than good, do you think that in its current state, that it's not the case, that you're-- %$* 74
are you arguing that-- %$* 74
the ephemeral concept of affirmative action is, in its-- %$* 74
like, in its end, a good in its own end? %$* 74
or are you saying that in its current state, everything is fine, we're good? %$* 74
currently, we can just continue on as is? %$* 74
okay. %$* 13
except for stupid affirmative action, as you've made clear. %$* 13
randy kennedy. %$* 13
i think that improvements can always be made. %$* 70
and i think that the point about disclosure is a fine point. %$* 70
again, i stated from the outside that-- %$* 70
does affirmative action have difficulties? %$* 70
does affirmative action have problems? %$* 70
does affirmative action have risk? %$* 70
does affirmative action have costs? %$* 70
yes, it does. %$* 70
there's always a question of-- %$* 70
compared to what? %$* 70
i maintain that affirmative action-- %$* 70
even with its blemishes, even with its many blemishes-- %$* 70
has been better for our country, for our institutions of higher education, than the most likely alternative, which was nothing. %$* 70
and because your opponents have the last word in the next round, rick, i'll give you the last word in this round, if you would like to take it. %$* 13
no, i'm fine. %$* 69
you want to pass? %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
and remember, we had you vote just before you heard the arguing begin. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again immediately after this upcoming round. %$* 13
and remember, the team that has changed your minds the most or moved most of you to their side in percentage point terms, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
but first, on to round 3, closing statements. %$* 13
from each debater in turn, uninterrupted, they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
first, to summarize her position in support of this motion, affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, gail heriot, professor at the university of san diego school of law and member of the u.s.commission on civil rights. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, gail heriot. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 68
this should not be a liberal or conservative issue-- %$* 68
and it didn't used to be. %$* 68
no less a liberal icon than supreme court justice william o. douglass-- %$* 68
made an eloquent plea on behalf of color-blind admissions policies back in the early 1970s. %$* 68
my personal favorite among the liberals on this issue was california supreme court justice stanley mosk. %$* 68
as a superior court judge, and later as california attorney general, mosk stuck his neck out for civil rights on many occasions, back in the 1940s, when it wasn't so popular, back when it could be a career killer. %$* 68
mosk called race-preferential admissions "the sacrifice of principle for the sake of dubious expediency.‚Äùlittle did he realize just how dubious that expediency would turn out to be. %$* 68
though maybe he should have. %$* 68
the research that we have been talking about today was not a bolt from the blue. %$* 68
the university of chicago sociologist james davis had concluded in the mid-1960s that college students who receive preferential treatment would have gone on to better careers, had they attended somewhat less elite institutions. %$* 68
he wasn't writing about affirmative action. %$* 68
back in those days, it was most legacies and athletes that were getting the preferential treatment. %$* 68
but if it does not work for legacies and athletes, why would it work for anybody? %$* 68
i am happy to stipulate that everyone involved in this experiment meant well, and i know it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that a strategy that you've put your heart into just isn't working. %$* 68
but this is not an ideological point. %$* 68
racial preferences don't work. %$* 68
we have lost precious time. %$* 68
let's not make it worse by ignoring the evidence. %$* 68
i urge you to vote in favor of the motion. %$* 68
thank you, gail heriot. %$* 13
and the round of applause for that-- %$* 13
our motion is affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, and here to summarize his position against this motion, randall kennedy. %$* 13
he is professor at harvard law school and author of the book, "for discrimination." ladies and gentlemen, randall kennedy. %$* 13
a good illustration of the way in which affirmative action has been helpful is attested to by-- %$* 70
or is suggested by the actions even of people who say that they are against affirmative action. %$* 70
couple of examples: ronald reagan. %$* 70
ronald reagan says he was against affirmative action. %$* 70
but candidate ronald reagan was asked, if you become president of the united states, "what will you do when it comes to appointing someone to the supreme court of the united states? %$* 70
" ronald reagan said, "if you make me president of the united states, i will appoint a woman to the supreme court." and he did. %$* 70
was that affirmative action? %$* 70
yes, that was affirmative action. %$* 70
and in fact, when he appointed sandra day o'connor, there were people who said, well, you know, what about this? %$* 70
you said that, you know, gender and race and that sort of thing shouldn't matter. %$* 70
he said, to his credit, "we simply cannot have a supreme court of the united states that has a male monopoly. %$* 70
it's just illegitimate. %$* 70
there's something not right about it."there is a reason why every presidential candidate since the cabinet-- %$* 70
since the cabinet of john f.kennedy has had people of color in it. %$* 70
no matter what their ideological persuasion, presidents made sure racial minorities in the cabinet because they understood it would be illegitimate in the eyes of the citizenry to have a racially or gender homogenous cabinet. %$* 70
the same thing goes for the strategic institutions in american life, including our campuses. %$* 70
it will simply not do in this day and age to have campuses that have discreet groups who've been disadvantaged excluded from them. %$* 70
randall kennedy, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is, affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, richard sander. %$* 13
he is professor at ucla school of law and co-author of the book "mismatch." richard sander. %$* 13
well, i hope, gail and i persuaded you that we're approaching this not as an ideological matter but as one of pragmatism. %$* 69
i care deeply about these issues. %$* 69
i have worked on civil rights issues most of my adult life. %$* 69
i have an african-american college-age son and a first grade daughter who goes to central los angeles schools, in a school that's-- %$* 69
half free lunch. %$* 69
i care deeply about these issues. %$* 69
and part of what informs my perspective is that when i look at higher education leaders, when i look at the folks that i know and have worked with, i see them as people who also have goodwill and are committed to racial justice and are not feeling beholden to affirmative action as something that they have to do for greater racial equality. %$* 69
they feel lots of other pressures. %$* 69
but i'm very confident that if we reform affirmative action, they will try to find new ways to expand opportunity. %$* 69
that's exactly what's happening in california under prop 209.there's been much closer collaboration between colleges and the k-12 pipeline since prop 209 passed. %$* 69
there's been much greater focus on class-based affirmative action. %$* 69
those things happen when you restructure the incentives. %$* 69
and what i'm arguing for, i think what gail is arguing for, is that we need to restructure the incentives that are behind the current preference system. %$* 69
i want to mention one other problem that's deeply embedded in our current structure, and that's the problem of social mismatch. %$* 69
when you use very large racial preferences to create racial diversity, you open up a credentials chasm that's an invitation to feelings of alienation and isolation among the group that's benefited. %$* 69
and it's an invitation to negative stereotyping among the group that's in the majority. %$* 69
it's been shown that if you reduce social mismatch, if you bridge that gap some, you actually increase social interaction. %$* 69
we can do a better job of figuring out where students end up in college and producing not only good outcomes for them but for their campuses. %$* 69
thank you, rick sander. %$* 13
our motion, affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, and here with the last word, to argue against the motion, ted shaw, professor at columbia law school and former director of counsel and president of the naacp legal defense and educational fund, ladies and gentlemen, ted shaw. %$* 13
so let me thank our worthy adversaries for their participation in this discussion. %$* 71
let me start by saying that there is stigmatization of african-americans in america. %$* 71
there has always been stigmatization of african-americans in america. %$* 71
and it hasn't been the consequence of affirmative action. %$* 71
it's part of our long history, our struggle with what's been this country's greatest demon. %$* 71
and the great irony in my view is that some people conclude from that horrible history that as a consequence we should not think, talk, or do anything consciously about race. %$* 71
they equate in a way that says that there is symmetry race conscious measures aimed at including people with invidious racial discrimination that is based upon superiority and inferiority. %$* 71
much of this discussion, whether intentionally or not, echoes as i said earlier the rumors of inferiority which continue to exist in this country. %$* 71
it is in my view an inexplicable statement to say that in 21st century america african-americans ought to go to lesser institutions and there'll be more, therefore, of them coming out as doctors, physicians, lawyers, scientists, et cetera. %$* 71
i don't get that argument. %$* 71
and i think it is just factually wrong. %$* 71
it isn't about whether we see race. %$* 71
the question is, having seen it, how do we treat one another, whether we include one another or whether we exclude one another. %$* 71
thank you. %$* 13
ted shaw. %$* 13
that concludes round three of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now it's time to see how persuasive these debaters have been. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and vote for the second time. %$* 13
again, if you agree with this motion after having heard the arguments, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good," push number one on your keypad. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we're going to lock it out in about 15 seconds. %$* 13
and then we will have the results in about a minute and a half. %$* 13
so while we're doing that and waiting for the results to come, the first thing i want to say is not only has it been a pleasure for us to be here but it's been a pleasure for intelligence squared u.s. to be on-- %$* 13
to be in association with four debaters who brought to this stage not only the passion but also the decency and the civility to respect one another's views on something that can be very deeply personal. %$* 13
it stayed always civil and intelligent and informative, so i just want to invite a round of applause to all of them for the way that they did this. %$* 13
and on that theme, as nick rosenkranz mentioned at the beginning, we came here because a student approached him after he was making a presentation and invited us to come up here. %$* 13
and he was with the harvard law school federalists society, but from that point on his partner in bringing us here and in making arrangements and in helping us get on the stage was the american constitution society. %$* 13
two organizations that don't normally hang out at the same clubroom really worked together to put this together for us, and we think in itself that embodies the kind of spirit of what we're trying to do. %$* 13
so we want to thank and congratulate both of those groups for doing that. %$* 13
love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
use the twitter handle, @iq2us. %$* 13
our hashtag is affirmaction. %$* 13
our next debate is next week, march 5, at the national constitution center in philadelphia. %$* 13
the motion is "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad." supporting that motion, alan dershowitz, the felix frankfurter-- %$* 13
i knew i was going to hear that-- %$* 13
professor of law at harvard law school, michael lewis, a professor at ohio northern university's pettit college of law. %$* 13
then on march 12 we will be in new york debating the motion, "russia is a marginal power." the debaters include a political risk strategist, a former deputy national security advisor, and journalist from the economist and london's mail on sunday. %$* 13
we want to encourage you to watch the live stream of any of these on iq2us.org or fora.tv and listen to these debates on npr stations across the country, including here in this neighborhood. %$* 13
and you can go to twitter and facebook for our-- %$* 13
to see what our upcoming debates are. %$* 13
and we are very, very open to taking ideas on topics. %$* 13
so if you have anything, please check-- %$* 13
kick it in. %$* 13
okay, so i have the results now. %$* 13
remember we had you vote once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared the winner. %$* 13
the motion is this, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good.‚Äù here are the results, before the debate 22 percent of you agreed with the motion, 48 percent were against, and 30 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
the teams now need to move those numbers. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
on this motion, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good," the team arguing for the motion on their second vote, it's 36 percent. %$* 13
they went from 22 percent to 36 percent. %$* 13
they've picked up 14 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see the argument-- %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, in their first vote it was 48 percent. %$* 13
their second vote is 55 percent. %$* 13
they pulled seven percentage points, but that is not enough. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good," has won this debate on our rules. %$* 13
we congratulate them. %$* 13
and thank you from intelligence squared and me, john donvan. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

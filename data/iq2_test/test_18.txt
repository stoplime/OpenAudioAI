you know, you might not get a return for three years, five years, seven years down the road. %$* 54
that's risky, but it's even riskier, and you're less likely to do it, if you don't know what you're going to be paid back in. %$* 54
is it going to be a 100 cent dollar, an 80 cent dollar, a 20 cent dollar? %$* 54
if you don't know, get less of that productive investment and look at-- %$* 54
okay, so you're broadly saying, in terms of the workers' question, that stability is good for workers because there are factories, and they're working in their jobs, and they-- %$* 13
well, you get an environment where people invest and things get done. %$* 54
you %$* 54
john taylor, your opponent. %$* 13
yeah, i don't think steve answered the question at all about workers' salaries and how well they're doing. %$* 53
well, workers' salaries under the gold standard went up. %$* 54
you take any period of time, they went up in real terms, which is why our wages in real terms are the highest in the world. %$* 54
yeah, i wonder about dickens and some of the stories of that period. %$* 53
but-- %$* 53
he was an englishman, the last i heard. %$* 54
yeah, but i just wonder. %$* 53
john taylor. %$* 13
the fact is, is that the example that jim gave, where the asians were beginning to develop products at cheaper prices and all this kind of stuff, implied a decline in u.s.wages. %$* 53
absolutely positively, unless the u.s.government was pushing to keep the wage levels of u.s.workers up. %$* 53
and so i believe that, in fact, the movement to a weak dollar had a lot to do with the fact that we had a growth in asia coming, and product was coming in much cheaper and basically undercutting, well, not only detroit, but california, and the-- %$* 53
if you look at apples, or whatever, they're-- %$* 53
none of them are made in the united states, right? %$* 53
because the reason-- %$* 54
the reason, john, we got cars coming into this country starting in the late '60s was that unfortunately for a period of time the germans and japanese made a better car and people preferred that to what was being turned out in detroit, which is how they got in trouble. %$* 54
it's not american workers. %$* 54
when other foreign companies came over and established car plants, they could turn out excellent cars. %$* 54
our workers made excellent wages. %$* 54
it wasn't because cars were cheap, people felt they worked better, whether the low end of the car line or the high end. %$* 54
that's good competition. %$* 54
john taylor, continue your point, unless you were done. %$* 13
i'm finished. %$* 53
all right, so i-- %$* 13
so john's-- %$* 13
john was making the point, and you just disputed it by saying that there were other reasons that people bought cars, but this-- %$* 13
the team that's arguing that american doesn't need a strong dollar policy has made the point a couple of times that a weaker dollar boosts exports. %$* 13
we all see the logic of that argument, and i'm assuming you see the logic of the argument, but what's the flaw in the argument? %$* 13
jim grant. %$* 13
with a cheaper currency, you pay more for what you buy, and you earn less from what you're-- %$* 55
jim, i just got a signal that they need you to move a little closer to your mic. %$* 13
yeah, if you move it a little bit closer and then-- %$* 13
okay, %$* 55
are you good? %$* 13
is that good? %$* 13
yeah, okay, thank you. %$* 13
okay, with a cheap currency, you pay more for what you buy, and you earn less from what you sell. %$* 55
now, tell me what are the advantages of a cheap currency. %$* 55
yeah, look at the price of gasoline, $1.25 in the late '90s. %$* 54
what is it, three and a half, four, $5 today? %$* 54
how does that help a family? %$* 54
how does that increase their %$* 54
rick mishkin. %$* 13
i want to change this issue a little bit, that-- %$* 52
well, no, actually, no, no, i like your question. %$* 13
no, no, i want to deal with the question in the following sense, which is that what goes on in the real economy is actually much less associated with what goes on in terms of the inflation that in fact you're attributing it to, and in particular, that a lot of things you've talked about in terms of high growth and so forth, or whether you have good institutions, a good legal system, and so forth, so what we really need to focus on is a narrower issue that-- %$* 52
does a strong dollar actually help the economy? %$* 52
does it hurt it? %$* 52
does having a good dollar yardstick help the economy? %$* 52
does it hurt it? %$* 52
i think that's very important, but not-- %$* 52
let's not get into this view that having a strong dollar, or gold standard, or weak dollar actually solves all of our problems. %$* 52
this actually solves very little of the problems. %$* 52
it's still important. %$* 52
the gold standard-- %$* 55
jim grant. %$* 13
i mean, the idea that our fiscal affairs after 1971 when the dollar lost this anchor, what remained of the anchor-- %$* 55
the idea that our fiscal affairs were not affected by our capacity to print dollars to infinity just strikes me as something on its face-- %$* 55
are you arguing that? %$* 13
i would actually disagree with that. %$* 52
i think you're absolutely right that we went through an extremely bad period, we actually call it the great inflation period. %$* 52
it was extremely bad policy-- %$* 52
i mean the-- %$* 55
i mean, the-- %$* 55
wait. %$* 52
and also the fiscal irresponsibility, but this is a choice of the governments are spending too much relative to what they take in. %$* 52
no one in the face of the earth could resist the temptation to emit the reserve currency which we are privileged-- %$* 55
or not privileged to into the world at interest rates now prevailing-- %$* 55
manipulated interest rates, john, in the federal reserve. %$* 55
that's why they're 2 percent the world over. %$* 55
it's not as if we are improvident in a way our forbearers were not. %$* 55
they had strictures, they had a system within which they had to run their affairs. %$* 55
they had to balance the budget, that was the norm of the monetary regime and ruling the norm of monetary regimes over today is debt. %$* 55
and it's not-- %$* 55
as john himself said, it's not going to end well. %$* 55
john taylor. %$* 13
i think that there's an argument being made here that what happened in the '70s is what's happening today, and there's an argument being made, also, that we cannot manage ourselves, our money, without having some procrustean bed that we're forced into. %$* 53
i don't agree with that at all. %$* 53
i think that's really our point, is that you have be flexible; the dollar has period where it needs to be strong. %$* 53
i-- %$* 53
paul volcker is one of my heroes. %$* 53
he did everything right when he came in. %$* 53
and i was there for the saturday night massacre and i did not have a good time, but it was the right thing to do when he all of a sudden changed the way that the fed manage money and interest rates shot up by 4 percent over the weekend. %$* 53
that was a very, very good shock for the u.s.government, and it was a brilliant stroke. %$* 53
it had nothing to do with the price of gold, it changed it a great deal, but it really was a decision made by the fed and, obviously, with the agreement of the treasury. %$* 53
steve forbes, your opponent, john taylor, has just used the word flexibility and that is-- %$* 13
that's a key theme for them, that the government needs to have the flexibility to move the dollar as it can depending on economic circumstances, it’s a tool. %$* 13
what about that argument? %$* 13
it's like saying if you change the measuring rod, that'll increase prosperity. %$* 54
why not change the number of minutes in an hour? %$* 54
let's say you increase the number of minutes from 60 to 70-- %$* 54
but you've said that already and i-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 54
but i'm making-- %$* 54
but i'm making-- %$* 54
but, but, but-- %$* 13
i, i, i-- %$* 13
but i'm making the point. %$* 54
all right, you use whatever analogy you want. %$* 54
flexibility in terms of a-- %$* 54
of a measurement is not the way you cure economic problems; what it does is reduce-- %$* 54
brings in a factor of instability so you don't know what you're going to get paid back in, you suppress people's wages. %$* 54
why is that-- %$* 54
why is that a good thing? %$* 54
what country has ever become, in modern times-- %$* 54
what country has outpaced, in terms of a standard of living, with a weak currency, chronically weak currency, than those that have had traditionally strong currencies? %$* 54
argentina-- %$* 54
rick mishkin. %$* 13
150 years ago thought it was going to be a rival of the u.s., but it went in for funny money and they're paying the price for it to this day. %$* 54
rick mishkin. %$* 13
steve forbes just said why is that a good thing, being able to have that tool? %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
you know, take 30 seconds and answer that-- %$* 13
first of all, i wouldn't want to say that the dollar-- %$* 52
the value of a dollar should be the tool we're using. %$* 52
what we do need is the technology in order to keep the dollar yardstick working in a way that we can actually plan in the future, know what the price level is going to be next year so that we actually can make good decisions. %$* 52
we actually agree on that. %$* 52
the question is what kind of technology do you want to use? %$* 52
do we need to go back to the era with-- %$* 52
how are you using the term technology? %$* 13
just take a moment. %$* 13
so what i mean by this is that one technology is actually to tie the dollar to gold. %$* 52
that's a technology. %$* 52
another kind of technology that you can use is, in fact, what central banks have been adopting and actually very successfully in terms of something called inflation targeting. %$* 52
they have actually adopted a policy of saying "we're trying to keep inflation stable, in the last 10, 15 years have been very successful at doing that. %$* 52
they have not solved other problems like financial stability, but there are reasons why that has to be a concern of a separate nature. %$* 52
jim grant. %$* 13
rick. %$* 55
sorry that i got you so upset. %$* 52
you know you're-- %$* 13
jim, you're-- %$* 13
if only the radio audience could see your face, jim. %$* 13
and if your-- %$* 52
if your bowtie got unraveled, that's the question that i want to ask. %$* 52
or spin, that would be a good effect. %$* 13
look, inflation is a defined term. %$* 55
i think it is worth noting that the inflation of house prices, which went unremarked by our financial scholars at the federal reserve. %$* 55
the inflation in house prices almost brought this country, financially speaking, down. %$* 55
now, the cpi or the, whatever the fed’s preferred measure of inflation, was fine. %$* 55
unbeknownst to the fed and hundreds of monetary scholars on the payroll, some of them whom i’d keep by the way, just for the sake of equity. %$* 55
unbeknownst to these experts, there was building up in the economy, something that models didn’t even look at, which is a huge build up of unsupportable debt, mortgage debt in the banking system and outside the banking system. %$* 55
now inflation is not a certain threshold reading on a cpi inflation, it’s too much money. %$* 55
chasing something we’ll know about after the bubble burst. %$* 55
now it could be inflation of the checkout counter, that was 1970, but you must keep up, right john? %$* 55
must keep up with the modern times and inflation can be an inflation of bond prices, of equities, of lbo debt, of greenwich real estate. %$* 55
because by the way, the rich get richer in a regime of low interest rates, and they get richer big. %$* 55
they get richer big because they borrow for nothing. %$* 55
so inflation is a much subtler term than the fed knows or acknowledges to this day. %$* 55
and they can’t control it. %$* 55
it’s like a bubble underwater. %$* 55
they squeeze part of it and another part of the bubble protrudes. %$* 55
i just want to tell both of our panelists, after you make your point, i want to give each side an opportunity to ask a terse question to the other side, so you can be thinking about that. %$* 13
but this is not that turn. %$* 13
again, the issue is, you’re right, the bubbles can be very disastrous, particularly ones that involve credit markets. %$* 52
and we’ve just gone through a terrible period this way. %$* 52
but in fact this has been happening through history and in fact has been happening frequently when we’ve had gold standards and also when we didn’t. %$* 52
during the gold standard era, we actually had these bubbles all the times in the u.s.we had financial crises about every 10 to 20 years, so you’re right that this is something that we have to worry about. %$* 52
but catching the-- %$* 52
basically the strong dollar policy that you advocate is not going to produce the outcome you want. %$* 52
we actually need policies to think about moderating credit cycles. %$* 52
that’s something we have to worry about. %$* 52
i think we agreed on that. %$* 52
but in fact tying to gold, maybe you see it, but i sure as hell don’t/ %$* 52
response? %$* 13
steve forbes. %$* 13
well, and if you look at some of the financial crises in the 19th century not to mention the 20th century, it’s precisely when there’s fears that the u.s. was going to go off the gold standard. %$* 54
we briefly did during the war of 1812, played around with silver, which led to the panic of 1819.we had banks that weren’t regulated in the 1830s, they’d issued a lot of currency so we got a panic in 1837.and on and on you go. %$* 54
so it doesn’t prevent people from doing crazy things. %$* 54
but what a gold standard will do-- %$* 54
and why gold? %$* 54
what it means is you have a fixed measure value, like a north star. %$* 54
better than any other thing in the world, gold keeps its intrinsic value. %$* 54
it may go up a little bit, down a little bit, but it’s the best thing we humans have on earth for stability. %$* 54
so all it is is a measuring rod, making sure, the market should determine, not mandarins at the fed, how much money is needed in the marketplace. %$* 54
and under a gold standard, if you have a vibrant economy, plenty of money is created. %$* 54
if you have a stagnant economy, money’s not created. %$* 54
john taylor. %$* 13
stable and also flexible. %$* 54
john taylor. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 53
gold has been standard, 1800, 1200, the same year. %$* 53
stability? %$* 53
my foot. %$* 53
that says more about the dollar than gold. %$* 54
right. %$* 53
stable, gold is a fantastic speculative tool and was in the 1800s and is today. %$* 53
it wasn’t the 1800s, and what part of the 1800s was it a speculative tool john? %$* 55
i’m sorry, i should have said 1900s. %$* 53
i speak italian. %$* 53
so it’s a - 1800s that way. %$* 53
john, elaborate, because the more specific you can be in talking about these periods in which gold was not stable, the more we’ll see your point. %$* 13
right, okay. %$* 53
and then i want them to respond. %$* 13
the number of crises in the gold market during that period were phenomenal. %$* 53
the number of times the u.s.goes into the civil war, we’re off the gold standard. %$* 53
the franco-prussian war takes place, we’re-- %$* 53
they’re off the gold standard. %$* 53
everybody, when there’s a crisis, they step away from the gold standard. %$* 53
because? %$* 13
because there was no way for them to handle the money. %$* 53
because there’s no way for them to wage war. %$* 55
yeah. %$* 18
inflation is associated with peace and other regimes of monetary organization. %$* 55
that’s all very nice-- %$* 53
but there are times when you really need the money. %$* 13
they’re also arguing this is one of those times too when we really need the money. %$* 13
it’s not practical jim. %$* 53
it’s not practical. %$* 53
we really need the money when you have a war, when you have something or other. %$* 53
so why didn't george bush, ii, go off of the-- %$* 53
george bush, ii? %$* 55
why didn't he raise taxes and do the kinds of things he should have done? %$* 53
i mean, it's the same issue. %$* 53
it's a political decision made as it was in the franco-prussian war. %$* 55
steve forbes. %$* 13
during, when we had the gold standard, countries would go off gold when they fought a major war. %$* 54
why? %$* 54
because inflation's a form of taxation, of taking resources from you without putting a tax on you as john maynard keynes pointed out. %$* 54
this is the first time outside of a major war that we've had countries since the 1970s continuously undermining the value of their currencies. %$* 54
never happened in the developed world in peacetime like that. %$* 54
wartime, you do everything. %$* 54
you raise taxes, borrow money, print money to win the war. %$* 54
after the war, you go back to stability. %$* 54
this time, we haven't done it. %$* 54
i'm a little shocked here, which is we are talking as if we're in a period which we were in where we had super high inflation, and this was a huge problem, that's not the period we're in right now. %$* 52
we've had actually very stable inflation in the last 15 years. %$* 52
as jim just pointed out, when you trash your money, the symptoms aren't always the same. %$* 54
we had a huge housing bubble, disastrous housing bubble. %$* 54
but let me %$* 52
we had a commodity bubble. %$* 54
oil went from 20 to $100 a barrel. %$* 54
that's not a good thing to absorb a lot of money that should have gone to finding cures for cancer. %$* 54
one of the things we’ve learned-- %$* 52
rick mishkin. %$* 13
one of the things that we've learned is that actually getting price stability doesn't solve the problem of financial instability, doesn't solve the problem that we sometimes have these bubbles. %$* 52
that's in fact something that we do have to deal with. %$* 52
indeed, one of the views in terms of research is that actually having a stable period may actually encourage a bubble because people don’t think there's enough risk, and in fact there is a lot of risk. %$* 52
so i can't see how we're going to solve the problems here of bubbles by actually being in a situation where we actually tied to some kind of commodity. %$* 52
but you have to-- %$* 55
seems to me you have to distinguish between banking arrangements and monetary arrangements. %$* 55
we ought not to be surprised when in a system in which the capitalists get the up side in the banking business, and we the people suffer the down side when their bets go wrong, we ought not to be surprised that these bankers take exceptional risks. %$* 55
we are living in what the military people call an asymmetric world. %$* 55
to the up side goes greenwich, connecticut, to the down side goes dayton. %$* 55
john taylor. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, one of the best economists who did not win the nobel prize, and i would argue the only reason he didn't win it was because he died first, was hyman minsky. %$* 53
and one of the-- %$* 53
they've all win a nobel prize. %$* 55
one of the-- %$* 53
what? %$* 53
they've all won a nobel prize, every single economist has won the a nobel prize it seems. %$* 55
minsky should have won the nobel prize. %$* 53
he died too early, but his-- %$* 53
one of the easy ways to remember him is stability breeds instability. %$* 53
and the more stable the situation is, the more you feel free at taking risk, the more risk you take, the more likely you are to get hit in the head. %$* 53
all right, let's go-- %$* 13
let's see what the team that is arguing for a strong dollar policy, which is in our case the against the motion team, what's your killer question to the other side? %$* 13
well, this isn't a killer question. %$* 55
yeah, killer question. %$* 13
rick that means really short. %$* 13
could you please tell us why you-- %$* 55
all right, jim grant, you go. %$* 13
why you feel we have too little inflation? %$* 55
excuse me? %$* 52
could you please tell us why you feel we have too little inflation? %$* 55
yes, because the way to think about this is that inflation is a-- %$* 52
it's what you think is the right rate of inflation is a means to an end. %$* 52
what we really want to have is high growth in the economy and stability in the economy, that's what we're really after. %$* 52
and if you have an inflation rate which is too low, then you're actually in a situation where you get deep deflation, something that you think is not a problem, but i can tell you, when you look at history and ask when we've had the worst crises, and the worst recessions, and the worst depressions, they were always associated with deflation. %$* 52
so this is not something that i see as a particular positive. %$* 52
so you actually want to protect against not having too high inflation and not having too low. %$* 52
the second thing that's very important in this regard is that when you have an inflation rate which is too low, you actually get into a situation where sometimes, because of a very negative shock as we've had recently, you would actually like to drive nominal interest rates below zero. %$* 52
you'd like to drive the federal funds rate negative, and you can't do it, and, therefore, you can't stimulate the economy enough. %$* 52
so this is actually a problem that we worry about tremendously in terms of the policy circles. %$* 52
and what it tells you is you want to have a deflation rate which is, one, not so high that you spend a lot of time actually making decisions about where the price level's going to be, but instead produce, which produces a good economy, but secondly not so low that you end up in a situation where you get deflations, where you get this situation where you can't do expansionary policy when you need it, and as a result you have to pick a number in between. %$* 52
most central banks have chosen around %$* 52
let me step in because i did you kill him because i don't think you killed him. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
let-- %$* 13
i just wanted to get-- %$* 13
let him get his answer out. %$* 13
and this side, your question to the other-- %$* 13
to your opponents, the side arguing against a strong dollar. %$* 13
so the issue that i would raise here is when we look at history-- %$* 52
no, not make a point, ask them a question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 52
so do you feel that, in fact-- %$* 52
that the economy was much more stable during the gold standard period than it has been in other periods? %$* 52
during the gold standard period the united states had the highest growth rate in history, 4 percent real a year. %$* 54
that's why we became the greatest nation in the world. %$* 54
thank you, george washington, who understood what the fed doesn't understand today. %$* 54
i would actually respond to that, which is when you actually ask what happens in terms of growth rates, most of this has nothing to do with monetary policy, with gold, or anything else-- %$* 52
what it has to do with is-- %$* 54
it has to do with technology and so forth-- %$* 52
technology is created by people when you have a stable currency and people can invest in the future and not have to hedge in gold. %$* 54
why would you want to buy a block of gold? %$* 54
people ask me, "why do you invest-- %$* 54
should i invest in gold? %$* 54
" that tells you, why wouldn't they be investing in stocks and things like that? %$* 54
when you have a period of unstable currency, people hedge, people buy hard assets. %$* 54
and we've seen this time and time again. %$* 54
so we got the technology precisely because we had a stable money and people could invest the money, not have to worry about the value of the money. %$* 54
i want to go to audience questions now. %$* 13
so if you raise your hand a mic will come to you. %$* 13
please stand up. %$* 13
i might ask you to hold for a second so that the camera can catch up with you. %$* 13
please tell us your name; if you're with a news organization we'd appreciate it if you would be willing to tell us that as well. %$* 13
and really be terse. %$* 13
you just saw two examples of really sharply focused questions. %$* 13
go right down in the front here. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
yeah, if you stand a mic will come. %$* 13
i'm sorry, i thought we had somebody in that aisle but here it comes around the side. %$* 13
hi, vicki schmelzer, market news international. %$* 19
what effect does a strong dollar policy have on the status of the dollar as reserve-- %$* 19
as the world's reserve-- %$* 19
world's premier currency? %$* 19
i'm glad you asked that question. %$* 13
who would like to start? %$* 13
either side can start with that question. %$* 13
steve forbes, you look like you're-- %$* 13
like the wheels are turning. %$* 13
yeah? %$* 13
the dollar became so-called "reserve currency" because, thanks to the stable dollar, people wanted to use it around the world. %$* 54
we're the largest economy in the world, and so it was by nature, by markets, not by governments and central banks. %$* 54
before us, you had the british pound, good as gold until the first world war. %$* 54
so that was the reserve currency. %$* 54
for a time, dutch coins were used for global commerce, or silver. %$* 54
but you get it, the dollar became the reserve currency, we're the largest economy in the world, and we have to-- %$* 54
is it-- %$* 13
is it-- %$* 13
considered at one point-- %$* 54
is it entirely-- %$* 13
steve, is it entirely desirable to be the reserve currency? %$* 13
it's entirely desirable to have a stable currency and high growth rates, absolutely. %$* 54
yeah, but is it a desirable-- %$* 13
is it desirable to the reserve currency? %$* 13
i would-- %$* 55
jim grant, then i'll come back to this side. %$* 13
may i add-- %$* 55
add to my partner's remarks-- %$* 55
jim grant. %$* 13
i would submit that it's not so desirable, because we are given the irresistible invitation to consume more than we produce. %$* 55
not since 1975, i believe, have we ran a surplus on account of trades and services. %$* 55
we ship these dollars abroad, they come back to us as investments, and we are given the-- %$* 55
as i say, this ever so sweet path to fiscal ruin. %$* 55
we have accumulated more than $3 trillion and the feds own balance sheet custody holdings of u.s.treasuries that foreign governments and central banks hold against us. %$* 55
so the reserve currency is the invitation to, first the u.k. after 1914, and then us, to consume more than we produce, and it's not the swiftest way to prosperity. %$* 55
other side, side arguing that america does not need a stronger dollar policy. %$* 13
why did the-- %$* 53
why did the dollar become the world reserve currency? %$* 53
john. %$* 13
it was the only currency left standing in 1945, period. %$* 53
there was nothing else, we gave our money to everybody. %$* 53
we were also, really, the only country left standing. %$* 52
at that point we had over 50 percent of the manufacturing capacity in the world. %$* 52
right. %$* 53
and the net effect of that is the dollar went out there and went out all around the world, and financed international trade, financed international growth, and more and more-- %$* 53
it does so today. %$* 53
and the world is path-dependent, i.e., history makes the future. %$* 53
and because the dollar is so dominant in the world, it's just there. %$* 53
and i agree-- %$* 53
is it-- %$* 13
is this-- %$* 13
it's a hard spot. %$* 53
is this issue of it's being a reserve currency-- %$* 13
i think this is part of the sense of the question-- %$* 13
related to its strength or weakness or its stability or its flexibility? %$* 13
no. %$* 53
why not? %$* 13
i don't think-- %$* 53
i mean, it would have to completely collapse. %$* 53
i mean, the fact of the matter is is that everybody is investing in these 2 percent dollars even though jim says we're forced to invest and the u.s. government is nobody forces the chinese to buy u.s. debt at 2 percent. %$* 53
another question. %$* 13
they do, though. %$* 53
sir? %$* 13
michael mckee with bloomberg news. %$* 18
steve and jim, right now, we’re seeing $1 buy about 96 yen and there are complaints from detroit and other places that the yen is too weak. %$* 18
when the clinton administration first formulated its strong dollar policy, a dollar bought 104 yen and their rationale was the dollar was too weak. %$* 18
can you define what a strong dollar is, or in your term, a stable dollar, and how would you know? %$* 18
steve forbes. %$* 13
a stable dollar is one that’s fixed to gold, call it $1,500 an ounce. %$* 54
that’s stability. %$* 54
is that your price, and why? %$* 18
well if you’re going to go to a gold standard, you would have a period of adjustment. %$* 54
you don’t know today if that 15, 1600 price is factoring in a lot of future inflation. %$* 54
if people don’t expect it anymore, the price may come down. %$* 54
so you have a period of adjustment. %$* 54
but the fact of the matter is, what you see happening today is slow motion what happened in the early 1930s when countries thought that the way out was to devalue their currencies, starting with germany, then britain in 1931. thirty countries followed afterwards, begger than neighbor policies, which is why britain and others agreed to go back on gold in 1944. they saw what happened during the depression. %$* 54
other questions? %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
hi, my name is kenton phillips, and my question in this case is specifically to mr. %$* 18
forbes. %$* 18
in your opening statement, you mentioned that a lot of the mischief that occurred in the economy, a lot of the financial accounting scandals and tricks that people turned, that didn’t really produce any value, was attributed to the floating dollar. %$* 18
could you state why exactly a strong dollar or gold based dollar would actually prevent that type of financial mischief? %$* 18
well first of all, if you had a stable dollar, then the ability to make money in terms of violent currency trading goes away. %$* 54
when you have a stable currency, even when you have unstable currency, most countries like to fix, or have at least an attachment to another currency to facilitate trade. %$* 54
so you’d see what you had under the bretton woods system, pretty good stability. %$* 54
when you have a stable dollar, since commodities are denominated in dollars, the violence you see in commodities goes down, so the ability to play games with that goes down. %$* 54
and you also have, you can now then makepositive investments again, no need for exotic instruments to play games with the housing mortgages and the like. %$* 54
and i think you would see a smaller banking sector. %$* 54
one of the things that’s happened since we’ve gone off gold is that finance as a percentage of our gdp at one point had doubled. %$* 54
and it should have gone in the opposite direction. %$* 54
finance should have gone in the way of agriculture and other parts, where technology takes over and other parts of the economy grow. %$* 54
so, bankers, don’t worry, you’ll have jobs tomorrow. %$* 54
rick mishkin would like to respond to that point. %$* 13
not actually on that question, but i want to do a fact check, because steve forbes said something that i have some data in front me, actually by somebody they know very well. %$* 52
this is a paper that anna schwartz who i think you would consider to be the leading monetary historian of this generation along with milton friedman. %$* 52
and in fact, she looked at different periods, and the period of the classical gold standard, when the u.s.was continuing in the gold standard, was not a period of high growth. %$* 52
so the numbers right here is that the u.s. grew at 1.8 percent per year at that time. %$* 52
what period? %$* 55
from 1881 to 1913.this is as paper that anna wrote mike bordo called monetary policy regimes and economic performance: the historical records. %$* 52
so it’s very much on this topic. %$* 52
actually there was a lot of instability, that the standard deviation, how much variability there was, was 4.9.for her data, looking at the period from 1974 to 1995, which is after bretton woods went off the gold standard, that we actually had a situation where growth is about the same amount, with much less instability. %$* 52
my argument here is not that i think that the gold standard was good or bad for growth, but that it was not the key aspect. %$* 52
what was the first time period? %$* 13
the first period is from 1881 to 1913. %$* 52
all right jim, you were there. %$* 13
and also they wore bow ties then too. %$* 52
jim, so he’s giving you data that throws it back at you, can you respond to it? %$* 13
well first of all, i think it’s unfair bringing an electronic device to one of these debates. %$* 53
he’s got a piece of paper. %$* 13
it’s very analog. %$* 13
he came prepared. %$* 13
i use chalk and blackboard when i teach, which again, just shows what kind of person i am. %$* 53
i just want to tell the radio audience that you held up a piece of paper with your data on it. %$* 13
with respect to the late anna schwartz who was merely terrific, i don't believe those numbers. %$* 55
i've seen different numbers and i think-- %$* 55
but-- %$* 55
bigger numbers, describing growth. %$* 55
it, to me, defies common sense that the period 1880 to 1913 which saw the introduction of so much world beating and transformational technique, and production, and innovation, and invention would have yielded a growth rate so meager as 1.8 percent real over the course of that time. %$* 55
i don't credit it. %$* 55
i'm sorry, but-- %$* 52
i can tell you that this is research done with the best data that was available by somebody whose integrity is impeccable. %$* 52
and in fact she's not the only one to come up with these kind of numbers. %$* 52
now, you may not believe them, but you have different numbers, but unfortunately i have to go with what i think is good scholarship. %$* 52
well, i think there are other scholars who have produced better evidence that show a much rosier picture of growth in that era. %$* 55
and then real, real wages went up in that era as well, which is again why we have millions of people coming to this country, more than any other country in the world. %$* 54
saw it as a place of opportunity. %$* 54
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." more questions from the audience. %$* 13
sir, gray sweater. %$* 13
do you mind standing up? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
columbia business school actually. %$* 18
so, mr. %$* 18
forbes and mr. %$* 18
grant, the-- %$* 18
you've asserted that the goal standard creates stability inherently, but we've seen numerous asset bubbles throughout the gold standard periods including, you know, the south sea bubble in the united kingdom, the dutch tulip bubble, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 18
what prevents, in your opinion, the gold standard from creating or having more bubbles in that period as well? %$* 18
well, the gold standard to me is the least imperfect monetary regime, that has actually existed in human monetary history. %$* 55
the others have existed on blackboards at cambridge and mit, but the gold standard existed in practice for 100 years, the classical gold standard did. %$* 55
now, one must distinguish between the definition of money under the gold standard and the banking systems in play-- %$* 55
in place during that period. %$* 55
now, as steve mentioned, human beings will err, and sometimes they'll err en masse, and there will be crashes and bubbles. %$* 55
what to me characterizes the gold standard period is the absence of growth throttling long dated depressions, owing to-- %$* 55
owing to uncertainty about the future value of money. %$* 55
such depressions as existed in that period were typically the result of uncertainty about monetary fears, such as the one that started in 1893, such as the depression of 1890, when there was a great hew and cry over william jennings bryant. %$* 55
but banking bubbles it seems to me were much less severe for the simple reason that bankers at the time were personally accountable in some degree, certainly bank stockholders were personally accountable for the solvency of the institutions in which they invested. %$* 55
there was a double liability %$* 55
so i mean, really what they're saying is it would have been worse. %$* 13
they're not saying it's great, but it would have been worse. %$* 13
but how can you say that the gold standard prevents this? %$* 52
the great depression was a period where we were actually on the gold standard. %$* 52
it was not on the gold standard. %$* 55
that was the third rate variant on the gold exchange standard that happened after 1922 at genoa. %$* 55
there's not the gold standard. %$* 55
how do you define that? %$* 53
john taylor. %$* 13
the gold standard-- %$* 53
that's third rate, i'm sorry, what's second rate? %$* 53
second rate is bretton woods, third rate is 1920s and '30s, but the gold exchange standard was characterized by the buildup of reserve currency balances in other nations such as the british buildup in france and elsewhere. %$* 55
does anybody-- %$* 13
it was not at all %$* 18
is anybody planning to ask a question about what steve forbes mentioned was the moral dimension because i wanted to get to it in my questions, but my turn is over. %$* 13
so if anybody sort of signals to me that, that's your question-- %$* 13
you got an inside track. %$* 13
but in the meantime, in the meantime, right down here, sir. %$* 13
john feingold in light of trying to figure out the winner of tonight's debate, what measures should future historians look at to look back at tonight and determine who won? %$* 18
is it the price of gold, or is it the volatility of some other measure, or is it yet still another measure? %$* 18
all right, let me go put the question to this side because the last several questions have started on this side. %$* 13
i just want to balance it. %$* 13
so i think volatility is key, and we can look at historical periods and say, "how much volatility has there been? %$* 52
" so volatility of the business cycle, of employment, volatility of the growth of gdp, which was much higher during the period 1881 to 1913 and which is the period of the classical gold standard, the first great gold standard according to jim, than it was in later periods. %$* 52
that fact is very clear, i don't know of any serious scholar-- %$* 52
you may have people that you think have other numbers, but i can tell you that when i've seen the research that has been done in this area by people who have tremendous integrity and are incredibly respected, anna schwartz being one of those people, they come up with exactly that answer. %$* 52
and also there was actually much more volatility of the inflation rate during that period. %$* 52
that's the facts. %$* 52
right. %$* 53
let me answer that in a different way-- %$* 53
go ahead and-- %$* 13
both of you can talk %$* 13
because i think there's another way that's not anywhere near as technical as rick's way. %$* 53

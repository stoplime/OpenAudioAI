so nick, as i say, it's our first time here. %$* 13
how did this end up happening? %$* 13
so i was actually up here speaking at a federalist society conference about intellectual diversity in the legal academy. %$* 67
and a student came up and suggested that we bring iq squared up here. %$* 67
and the more that we thought about it, the more we thought it was actually kind of a perfect fit for the iq2 mission. %$* 67
and why is that? %$* 13
well, so a premise of american law is the same premise as iq2, which is that the best way to get to truth is to hear zealous advocates on both sides, and so it was sort of a natural affinity between american law and what iq2 is trying to do. %$* 67
let's talk a little bit about the timing then. %$* 13
i mean, the topic has been around for a long time and has gone through many ups and downs and iterations. %$* 13
why revisit this topic now? %$* 13
so, a couple of reasons, one is there is a pending supreme court case called schuette, and so people are watching that one closely. %$* 67
it will be interesting to see how that turns out. %$* 67
this case suggested that affirmative action might not be just constitutionally permissible but actually constitutionally required. %$* 67
that was sort of like a novel suggestion in the case below. %$* 67
now the supreme court is considering that. %$* 67
then a second reason is one of our debaters, professor sander, has just advanced kind of a new argument, which is that affirmative action actually harms the people it's intended to help. %$* 67
and that's quite a controversial argument, obviously, and surely, and certainly not everybody buys it. %$* 67
it will be very interesting to see whether that argument ends up having some traction. %$* 67
so i'll be watching for that in particular. %$* 67
all right. %$* 13
so we have a lot of good reasons for this to be happening now, and we have some spectacular debaters. %$* 13
you know some of them, and you'll meet some others. %$* 13
so let's welcome them to the stage and thank nick rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 67
thank you. %$* 13
and as we set many down and launch, i'd just like to ask for one more round of applause for nick rosenkranz and for the intelligence squared organization for bringing this up here. %$* 13
we stand now at the half century mark in a social experiment that has involved virtually every american whether or not she or he has wanted to be involved in it: affirmative action. %$* 13
it was 1965 that president johnson signed an order instituting affirmative action in government hiring. %$* 13
the idea was to make things right, to correct the legacy of minorities, and at that time in particular, african-americans being denied a seat at the table, a remedy that then and ever since has been controversial, but no more so than when it has been applied to the question of who gets accepted into america's elite universities or not. %$* 13
in university admissions, the debate and the argument has been that affirmative action has mostly achieved and is mostly achieving its goals, or that it is not. %$* 13
well, that sounds like the basis for a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the harvard law school's ames courtroom. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
our debate goes into three rounds, and then the audience here at the harvard law school votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion again, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good.” let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please let's welcome gail heriot. %$* 13
and, gail, you are a member of the u.s.commission on civil rights. %$* 13
you are a professor of law at the university of san diego law school. %$* 13
in 1996, you co-- %$* 13
chaired the campaign for proposition 209.that was a california proposition that banned race and gender- based references in republican education and in state hiring. %$* 13
it passed very famously. %$* 13
but voters may once again get the chance to vote on its key provisions. %$* 13
and my question to you, very briefly, if they are given the chance to vote again, seeing what they've seen now, do you think that voters will uphold it a second time around? %$* 13
i think they will. %$* 68
and do you think it's going to be a close call? %$* 13
i hope that it is not close. %$* 68
but direct democracy is a tricky business. %$* 68
you never know. %$* 68
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, gail heriot. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
gail, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the very talented economist rick sander. %$* 68
ladies and gentlemen, rick sander. %$* 13
rick, welcome. %$* 13
you are also arguing for this motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
you are professor of law at ucla.and in 2004, you published a controversial study that asserts that black law students are actually hurt by affirmative action. %$* 13
and to test out this theory, you filed a request for the records of the state bar of california because you wanted their data on race and grades and test scores. %$* 13
but they wouldn't give it to you, so you had to sue for its release. %$* 13
the california supreme court said yes in 2013. so have you seen the data? %$* 13
not quite yet. %$* 69
the court said that there is a public right for academics or anyone in the public to seek this data. %$* 69
but they also said that there have to be privacy safeguards with that, and we're still trying to work those out. %$* 69
timeline on this? %$* 13
i'd say between one month and seven years. %$* 69
all right. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we a proposal to the bar. %$* 69
thank you, rick sander. %$* 13
that's the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and now the team arguing against the motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
we have two debaters arguing. %$* 13
first let's please welcome randall kennedy. %$* 13
randall kennedy, this is a hometown crowd for you. %$* 13
you are the michael r.klein professor of law at the harvard law school. %$* 13
you are the author of six books, including "sellout: the politics of racial betrayal.” you're the author of a book with the n word in the title. %$* 13
and most recently, you are the author of "for discrimination: race, affirmative action and the law.” you've been described as being something of an iconoclast. %$* 13
and it's been said that your classroom, like your books, can be contentious. %$* 13
so is it your intent to push people's buttons? %$* 13
sometimes. %$* 70
how about tonight? %$* 13
no. %$* 70
no, okay. %$* 13
and your partner is, randall kennedy? %$* 13
my partner is ted shaw of the columbia university law school. %$* 70
ladies and gentlemen, ted shaw. %$* 13
and, ted, you're also arguing against the motion that affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
you are professor at the columbia law school. %$* 13
you've been involved in two landmark supreme court affirmative action cases. %$* 13
you played a key role in drafting the admissions policy upheld in-- %$* 13
upheld in grutter vs. %$* 13
bollinger .you were lead counsel for black and latino intervenors in gratz vs. %$* 13
bollinger. %$* 13
and in 2003, writing for the majority in gruder. %$* 13
back then justice o'connor on the supreme court had predicted that 25 years from now racial preferences would no longer be needed. %$* 13
that would put us 14 years away now. %$* 13
so, ted, is that possible? %$* 13
well, i always wondered where that number came from. %$* 71
but in any event, after justice o'connor left the bench, she and one of her former clerks authored an article which-- %$* 71
in which she repudiated that statement. %$* 71
so the 25 years is off. %$* 13
well, i'm not sure it was ever on. %$* 71
it was always dicta anyway. %$* 71
but she doesn't believe in it any more. %$* 71
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ted shaw. %$* 13
and thank you, ted shaw. %$* 13
our motion is, affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
and in this debate, there will be a winner and a loser. %$* 13
you, our live audience at the harvard law school, will have the chance to choose our winners by voting twice; once before you hear the debate and the arguments and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let me turn off my phone. %$* 13
and while i'm doing that, randy, i just wanted to say, i think you should pull up-- %$* 13
just for the sake of the microphone, to pull up to the table. %$* 13
that distance is great. %$* 13
so you helped me cover my phone faux pas. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so let's get onto the first round of voting. %$* 13
the motion is this: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
if you go to the key pads at your seat, we want you to tell us now where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
push number 1 if you agree with this motion, push number 2 if you disagree, and push number 3 if you are undecided. %$* 13
if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and the other keys are not live. %$* 13
and remember, you're going to vote a second time. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so our motion is "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good.” let's start with round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each. %$* 13
gail, you can step to the lecturn. %$* 13
and up first to argue for this motion, "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good," gail heriot, a professor of law at the university of san diego and a member of the u.s.commission on civil rights. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, gail heriot. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 68
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 68
rick and i are here to make a very narrow point, race preferential admissions policies are doing far more harm than good. %$* 68
the very large preferences that are now routinely employed by colleges and universities produce fewer, not more, black scientists, black engineers, and black medical doctors. %$* 68
they produce fewer black college professors and very likely fewer black lawyers. %$* 68
we are talking epic policy failure. %$* 68
before i get too far, let me say that we are not here to argue against outreach, outreach is not the source of the problem, nor are we here to argue that colleges and universities should consider only academic indicators like the sat in evaluating applicants. %$* 68
there are lots of ways to measure talent, though i would say that race is not one of them. %$* 68
but let me get back to my main point. %$* 68
race preferential policies don't work. %$* 68
how can that be? %$* 68
how can giving minorities a friendly leg up produce fewer minority professionals? %$* 68
well, let me explain. %$* 68
one consequence of widespread race preferential policies is that underrepresented minorities end up distributed among colleges and universities in patterns very different from their white and asian counterparts. %$* 68
when the highest school on the academic ladder relaxes academic standards in order to admit more minority students, the schools one rung down must do the same if they are to get minority students. %$* 68
the problem is thus passed down to the third rung on the ladder, which responds similarly. %$* 68
as a result, underrepresented minority students are concentrated at the bottom of most selective schools. %$* 68
the problem is not that there are no academically gifted minority students, but there are not currently enough at the very top tiers to satisfy the demand. %$* 68
and efforts to remedy that problem end up causing credentials gaps up and down the pecking order. %$* 68
for example, we learned in connection with the university of michigan supreme court litigation a decade ago that michigan granted preferences to underrepresented minority students equivalent to an entire letter grade. %$* 68
that is, african-american and hispanic students with a straight b, 3.0, average were treated the same as asian and white students with a straight a, 4.0, grade point average, all other things being equal. %$* 68
this is no tiebreaker in otherwise close cases. %$* 68
the preferences are very large, and since 2003 they've gotten larger. %$* 68
the problem is that entering credentials matter. %$* 68
students whose academic credentials are well below the average for the college and university they are attending will usually earn grades that are similar, while some students outperform their entering credentials, just as some students underperform theirs. %$* 68
most students will perform in the general range that their academic credentials suggest, and anyone who thinks otherwise is engaging in wishful thinking at student expense. %$* 68
no serious supporter of affirmative action denies this. %$* 68
the strongest evidence of backfire comes from science and engineering. %$* 68
contrary to what some people think, college bound african-american and hispanic students are just as interested as white students in majoring in science and engineering, actually a little more so, the numbers suggest. %$* 68
but these are difficult majors and many students of all races abandon that ambition. %$* 68
african-american and hispanic students jump ship at much, much higher rates than do whites. %$* 68
it's not surprising that those students, again, of any race, who give up on science and engineering disproportionately have lower entering academic credentials. %$* 68
but what some do find surprising and what is key to the argument that we're making this evening is that four in-depth published studies by researchers at dartmouth, the university of virginia, and duke, among others, and also one unpublished study so far by rick, here, all demonstrate that part of the effect is relative. %$* 68
an aspiring science major who attends a school where she's in the middle or towards the top of her class in entering credentials is much more likely to persevere and ultimately succeed than is an otherwise identical student, same entering academic credentials, who attends a school where her academic credentials put her towards the bottom of the class. %$* 68
put differently, preferences hurt, they don't help. %$* 68
the difference is not trivial, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 68
we would have a lot more science and engineering minority students graduating with that degree if we engaged in race-neutral admissions policies-- %$* 68
or at least did not give so great a preference to students. %$* 68
a similar study by stephen cole and elinor barber shows that minority students who attend colleges, whether entering credentials put them at the bottom of the class-- %$* 68
do not aspire to go on to graduate school and to become college professors in the same numbers as their identical-- %$* 68
identically credentialed minority counterparts who are attending somewhat less elite schools. %$* 68
and the reason should be obvious. %$* 68
students who get good grades in school tend to like school, in part because they correctly note that they're good at it. %$* 68
none of the results in any of these studies have been controversial. %$* 68
no one has rebutted any of it. %$* 68
the only mismatched study that's received any kind of criticism is rick's initial study of law school management-- %$* 68
law school mismatch, where data is hard to come by. %$* 68
but some of the very same people who criticized that study are the ones who are actively trying to prevent him from getting more, better data. %$* 68
that speaks volumes. %$* 68
gail heriot, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
and thank you very much. %$* 13
that speaks volumes. %$* 68
thank you, gail heriot. %$* 13
our motion is affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
and our next debater is going to speak against this motion. %$* 13
he's randall kennedy, the michael r. klein professor of law at harvard law school and author of the book "for discrimination: race, affirmative action, and the law.” ladies and gentlemen, randall kennedy. %$* 13
i disagree with the proposition and ask that you vote against it. %$* 70
i will argue that affirmative action advances key valuable goals of most institutions of higher education in america. %$* 70
my partner, theodore shaw, will address some of the charges made against affirmative action, such as the claim that it hurts its intended beneficiaries. %$* 70
let's be clear about what we defend. %$* 70
we defend conscious efforts to ensure the presence on our campuses of students affiliated with groups that, in the absence of special efforts, would be excluded or consigned to a negligible, isolating status. %$* 70
we do not feel obligated to defend all affirmative action programs across the united states. %$* 70
we do not support stupid affirmative action. %$* 70
but we do support the sensible affirmative action that has been the characteristic sort practiced on campuses across much of americaincluding admissions policies, that, under certain circumstances, select certain candidates over others with superior conventional credentials, such as standardized test scores and grades. %$* 70
educational institutions have a wide array of goals that are advanced by affirmative action. %$* 70
all seek to create excellent environments for teaching and learning. %$* 70
their leaders insist that racial and other sorts of diversity are essential to realizing the pedagogical mission that they envision. %$* 70
they maintain that racial diversity acquaints students with unfamiliar perspectives and sentiments, and that it assists in preparing students for an increasingly cosmopolitan country and demand world. %$* 70
this belief is held not only by academic administrators. %$* 70
it is also held by the executives who head many of the nation's leading business firms, the executives who submitted amicus curiae briefs to the supreme court several years ago in which they strenuously argued in favor of affirmative action programs on campus and convinced the court, in the words of justice sandra day o'connor, that the educational benefits of diversity are not merely theoretical, but real. %$* 70
some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to do what they reasonably can to assist and rectifying past racial wrongs, aware that mere cessation of invidious racial discrimination will often fail to undo the lingering effects of oppression in the past. %$* 70
these institutions engage in affirmative action to assist racial minority candidates who, though qualified in absolute terms, might otherwise lose out in competition for admission with those advantaged by racial or other sorts of illicit, but deeply entrenched privilege. %$* 70
some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to correct or offset invidious discrimination that constitutes an invisible headwind that impedes racial minorities, women and others who still face pervasive societal bias. %$* 70
these institutions make special efforts to identify talent, that in the absence of affirmative action would go unrecognized or underappreciated. %$* 70
these programs have served to encourage students and prospective students who might otherwise have been discouraged, mistakenly believing that the monopolies of the past were unchangeable. %$* 70
you will hear much from our adversaries about the supposedly dysfunctional side of affirmative action. %$* 70
i urge you to keep in mind that affirmative action has supplied a tremendous incentive that has prompted thousands to elevate their sights and pursue ambitions that they would not have otherwise pursued. %$* 70
this point strikes home with me with special force because i am one among those many thousands. %$* 70
some educational institutions see it as part of their mission to facilitate racial integration. %$* 70
they seek to do this for the purpose of making it conspicuously evident that pathways to leadership and upward mobility are accessible to all. %$* 70
one group that has pressed this point with notable vigor are leaders of the armed forces. %$* 70
they have repeatedly argued that racial diversity in the officer corps of the military is essential as a matter of national security and that at present, the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both excellent and racially diverse unless the service academies use race conscious recruiting and admissions policies. %$* 70
that affirmative action supports the educational missions of institutions of higher education, that it supports their ambition to assist with the task of correcting past and present injustices, that it facilitates racial, gender, class and other sorts of needed integration is more than enough to justify its continuation. %$* 70
please join with me in supporting affirmative action. %$* 70
please vote against the proposition that it does more harm than good. %$* 70
thank you. %$* 70
thank you, randall kennedy. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over there motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
you have herald the first two opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating for this motion that affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, let's introduce richard sander. %$* 13
he is a professor of law at ucla school of law and co-author of the book "mismatch: how affirmative action hurts students it's intended to help, and why universities won't admit it.” ladies and gentlemen, richard sander. %$* 13
thanks very much, john. %$* 69
so you've been told that truth is going to emerge from vigorous, zealous advocacy on both sides. %$* 69
and at my peril, i'm going to depart from that a little bit to try to suggest a little bit of a nuance because it seems to me that when we pose the question as an empirical one, is it doing more harm than good, rather than a moral one, is affirmative action right or wrong, we sort of take on the hats of social scientists. %$* 69
and if we're going to approach it scientifically, we need to be candid about certain things. %$* 69
so let me try to introduce some candor. %$* 69
let's compare law school and medical school. %$* 69
now, we're going to get more into the q and a about the actual merits of law school mismatch, but assume that i might, for the moment, that if you compare two students who go to different law schools, one with large preferences to one without, the one who receives large preferences is two or three times more likely to fail the bar exam. %$* 69
that event happens after the student has graduated from law school. %$* 69
and students who fail the bar, as one scholar put it, "are marooned.” the law school is no longer interested in their fate, and they've kind of given up on them as alumni contributors. %$* 69
let's compare that with medical school. %$* 69
medical school, there's also something like the bar exam. %$* 69
it's called the national boards. %$* 69
that's taken halfway through medical school, up to the second year. %$* 69
if a student fails the national boards, then at many medical schools, they're put in an academic support program. %$* 69
there's an effort to try to remediate and to try to help that student succeed. %$* 69
and there's some evidence that that works. %$* 69
so that means that affirmative action might be beneficial if we sort of provide the right institutional support to go with it. %$* 69
that generally is lacking. %$* 69
so that's one reason why, on balance, i think there's a harm. %$* 69
another example is when we think about science mismatch, as gail brought up. %$* 69
as she said, there are now four peer reviewed studies that show very clearly that if you receive a large preference into a college or university, you're 50 to 75 percent more likely to drop out of your science career on your way to getting a ba.and frequently, people drop out of college altogether. %$* 69
that has been shown to happen when you have a very large preference. %$* 69
what we don't know enough about, because we don't have enough data yet, is what happens with the small preference. %$* 69
suppose the size of the preference is not equal to 300 sat points, but the equivalent of 50 sat points. %$* 69
it's possible that smaller preferences don't cause that much of a mismatch effect and that the other positive effects of affirmative action like having a more challenging atmosphere and having peers who are really talented might outweigh. %$* 69
so i think we need to admit that there are tradeoffs. %$* 69
there are balances. %$* 69
we're not talking about something that's completely good or completely bad. %$* 69
it's a mixture. %$* 69
so why do i think that, on balance, you should vote for the proposition? %$* 69
first of all, there's no longer any reasonable doubt that very large preferences have negative consequences. %$* 69
that's now been shown in about 20 different peer-reviewed studies by over 20 different academics. %$* 69
and when ted presents rebuttals in his next remark, listen carefully for when he cites peer-reviewed published studies because those are the things that we're going to care about. %$* 69
we're going to care about studies that have gone through a process of actually being evaluated by other scholars and have been published in a reputable scholarly journal. %$* 69
that research overwhelmingly shows direct negative effects from large-scale preferences. %$* 69
and when i say, "large," i mean really large. %$* 69
the typical beneficiary of a preference-- %$* 69
well, the typical african-american student at an american law school has credentials that put them at below 99 percent of the white students. %$* 69
so the median black student has lower credentials than 99 percent of the anglo and asian students. %$* 69
that's a large preference. %$* 69
second, there have been a host of carefully done studies that have shown other sorts of really troubling side effects of affirmative action. %$* 69
for example, when the university of california implemented race-neutral policies after prop 209, we saw this really interesting jump in the takeup rate by black and hispanic students admitted to berkeley and ucla and some of the other elite campuses. %$* 69
now, why would the enrollment rate of accepted students jump? %$* 69
we'd like to know more about that. %$* 69
but a plausible explanation is that these students found it really attractive to attend a school where neither they nor anyone else thinks that they were admitted with a racial preference. %$* 69
so think about the implications of that. %$* 69
third, colleges and universities are locked into a pattern of institutional dishonesty. %$* 69
i don't think college leaders are intrinsically dishonest people, but the prevailing ideology of affirmative action makes it difficult and even hazardous for them to speak out about these issues or to really look at the effect and critically examine the effect of the programs that they're operating. %$* 69
to show this, consider the fact that the u.s. commission on civil rights, on which gail now sits-- %$* 69
i think at least one of these reports came before gail was on the commission-- %$* 69
two reports to the commission have shown significant mismatch effects and have raised very troubling issues about it. %$* 69
neither of these reports has ever been acknowledged by a higher education leader in america. %$* 69
there have been no task forces appointed. %$* 69
there's been no investigations undertaken. %$* 69
the reports have simply been ignored. %$* 69
there's a pattern of institutional unwillingness to deal with uncomfortable facts. %$* 69
that suggests that there's a need for reform. %$* 69
finally, we have almost no transparency about what goes non-higher education. %$* 69
schools do not provide information, unless they're forced to, about their actual admissions practices. %$* 69
they don't provide information about outcomes. %$* 69
when data comes out, it's either because of a lawsuit or because someone trusted as a reliable insider decides to write about the problem. %$* 69
that's what i did when i got access to data on how law school preferences actually worked. %$* 69
so we had this pattern of problems that suggest a crying need for reform. %$* 69
that's why i urge you to support the opposition. %$* 69
thank you, rick sander. %$* 13
our motion is "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good.” and here to speak against this motion, ted shaw. %$* 13
he's a professor of professional practice in law at columbia law school. %$* 13
and he's former director, counsel and president of the naacp legal defense and educational fund. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ted shaw. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 71
i urge you to vote against the proposition that affirmative action does more harm than good on campus. %$* 71
first, let us define what affirmative action is. %$* 71
it is a conscious attempt, a conscious attempt, to admit students from groups that have been underrepresented to campuses and universities at selective institutions, we can talk about preferences. %$* 71
we can use a lot of loaded terms, but that is the essence of affirmative action. %$* 71
we talk about harm. %$* 71
what kind of harm are we talking about and to whom? %$* 71
this discussion has proceeded-- %$* 71
this debate has proceeded focusing almost exclusively on african-american students on campus, which echoes the reality-- %$* 71
the continuing reality in our country, which is that most of the heat when it comes to issues of race is felt along that traditional black-white line even while the country has always been multiracial and diverse. %$* 71
there's lots of affirmative action that has existed and continues to exist in our colleges and universities quite aside from the issues of race impacting african-americans. %$* 71
of course, historically there was a great deal of affirmative action in this country for white males. %$* 71
even today, although almost no one talks about it, there is affirmative action for males generally because women in many instances are outperforming men academically. %$* 71
and colleges and universities concerned about having gender balance on campuses have quietly placed a thumb on the scale when it comes to male applicants. %$* 71
there are differences between performances on standardized tests and in gpa for that matter among ethnic and racial groups that we don't talk about a whole lot. %$* 71
generally speaking, white students are being outperformed by asian and asian-american students on standardized tests. %$* 71
does that mean that white students who are not admitted to institutions of higher education because they-- %$* 71
or they should not be admitted, rather, because they are being outperformed? %$* 71
no. %$* 71
colleges and universities don't simply take students in rank order and admit them solely on the basis of test scores and gpa.no one talks about stigma being visited upon women who have been beneficiaries of conscious efforts to open up opportunities in higher education. %$* 71
no one talks about stigma being visited upon white students who may have lower gpas than asian-american students or lower test scores. %$* 71
the only stigma conversation is the stigma with respect to african-americans, people of color but particularly african-americans. %$* 71
and i submit to you that that fact reflects that we continue to struggle even in 2014 with the age-old rumors of intellectual inferiority of african-americans. %$* 71
some people won't say it, but i submit that those rumors persist. %$* 71
now, there are tremendous differences between students who are educated in poverty impacted inner city urban high schools and students who attend privileged high schools. %$* 71
so it's important for us to understand that affirmative action, when it is done correctly-- %$* 71
and as my colleague, professor kennedy, indicated, we don't support what he calls "stupid affirmative action," there are instances in which it hasn't been done correctly, and i'd be glad to talk about those instances-- %$* 71
but when it's done correctly, what we're talking about is choosing among qualified students. %$* 71
and the question isn't whether or not or it is solely a question of whether or not students all have the same credentials. %$* 71
the question is whether or not institutions can choose among qualified students, so this shouldn't be a surprise that african-american students who attend schools that are academically challenged may not have the same criteria, nor should it be a surprise that given a long history in this country in which even today, right now as we stand here, nine out of 10 days of african-american presence in what's now the united states has been spent under jim crow, segregation or slavery-- %$* 71
shouldn't be surprised that there are still differences that we're struggling to overcome. %$* 71
so, mismatch theory, stigmatization-- %$* 71
i often think about the fact that, like professor kennedy, i am unapologetically a beneficiary of affirmative action. %$* 71
would i have felt more comfortable in the public housing project-- %$* 71
i grew up in the bronx-- %$* 71
knowing that i didn't get the benefit of affirmative action, but i had my integrity intact? %$* 71
i don't think so. %$* 71
ted shaw. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is "affirmative action on campus does more harm than good.” now we move on to round 2. and in round 2, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and you-- %$* 13
from you in our live audience. %$* 13
we have heard arguments from both sides. %$* 13
now, the side arguing for this motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, gail heriot and richard sander. %$* 13
first of all, they told us what they're not arguing. %$* 13
they're not arguing that all forms of affirmative action are not-- %$* 13
are doing more harm than good. %$* 13
they're fine with things like outreach. %$* 13
but it's the mechanism, they say, of racial preferences, that they call "misbegotten.” they argue that it backfires and hurts those that it is meant to help, that minority students can find themselves boosted into an academic pool in which they're in over their heads, and that they fail-- %$* 13
therefore, that they become discouraged. %$* 13
and that if they fail, it means that racial preferences, as a tool, have failed. %$* 13
although they say that universities do not want to admit this-- %$* 13
and will not share the data on this. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, randall kennedy and theodore shaw, they did not directly address the argument put forward by the other side, but they're taking another crack at this. %$* 13
they're basically telling you that affirmative action has done more good than harm. %$* 13
they're saying that the case for good comes from not only the impact of affirmative action on a wider student body of the experience of greater diversity, but that, also, in the sense that symbolism of affirmative action, in itself, encourages people who might never have attempted to get into an academic-- %$* 13
high academic setting-- %$* 13
to reach for something they may not have believed in before. %$* 13
they argue that this struggle is not over, that the issues and the deficits-- %$* 13
social and economic deficits that affirmative action were meant to address linger on today. %$* 13
so, those are basically the two arguments in there. %$* 13
i want to work through and revisit some of all of this, but work through a little bit, step by step, and take to the side that's arguing against this motion-- %$* 13
since you did not address the main point that your opponents made-- %$* 13
the mechanism by which they say that affirmative action and large-- %$* 13
large preferences-- %$* 13
actually, i'd like to ask you one more time to define what you mean by "large preferences," gail. %$* 13
you said we would be graduating more engineers and more scientists from minority groups, except that we're not, because we're giving them such a great preference. %$* 13
what is a great preference? %$* 13
well, i think the example from the university of michigan is a good one. %$* 68
that was an entire letter grade on the gpa-- %$* 68
or alternatively, 300 points on the combined sat. %$* 68
okay. %$* 13
so, i just want to make sure that we all know what it is we're talking about and what this disagreement is-- %$* 13
might be about on this issue. %$* 13
so, i want to go to the other side-- %$* 13
maybe take it to randall kennedy. %$* 13
so, your opponents are arguing that there's this-- %$* 13
there's this dynamic by which a minority student who is not-- %$* 13
who is not as academically prepared-- %$* 13
perhaps as measured by sat scores or gpa, or this high school of his origin, shows up in a place where he's up against some tough competition, and it kind of breaks him, breaks his spirit. %$* 13
he drops out. %$* 13
he changes out of the sciences. %$* 13
he never graduates whatever it is. %$* 13
that that's a dynamic-- %$* 13
that that you can see the psychological rationale that's being put forward there. %$* 13
i don't know if you want to take that on, or the numbers, or what, but if you could respond do it. %$* 13
sure. %$* 70
i'd be happy to respond. %$* 70
and there are a couple of responses. %$* 70
first, my adversaries make reference to studies that posit the mismatch thesis, which has been posited for a long time. %$* 70

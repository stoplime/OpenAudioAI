we are simply saying it should be done pursuant to the checks and balances that exist in the constitution but have been, uh, completely ignored in so many post-9/11 measures. %$* 51
i, i welcome the pi %$* 51
spirit of co %$* 51
collegiality in this program. %$* 51
and so in that spirit i’m going to begin my argument against – or i should say, continue my argument-- %$* 51
against the domestic spying and, uh, big brother type approach that the other side has been advocating by quoting someone whose policies they are defending – none other than president george w.bush himself. %$* 51
in the president’s very first public statement on that infamous date of september 11th, he hailed our nation as the brightest beacon of freedom in the world. %$* 51
and he vowed that no one will keep that light from shining. %$* 51
well, ever since then the aclu has been working very hard to help the president keep that vow. %$* 51
it would be tragic if we let the terrorists terrorize us into abandoning the very ideals that they attacked. %$* 51
and that is the key reason why you must vote no on tonight’s resolution, why more domestic surveillance is not better than another 9/11.indeed, with more surveillance of the type that has been proliferating since 9/11 – namely, surveillance that is unjustified, unwarranted, unchecked – not to mention un- constitutional – with more of this kind of surveillance the terrorists don’t need another 9/11 to accomplish their goals. %$* 51
of course, on that dreadful date thousands of people were horribly killed but their tragic deaths were not the terrorists’ goal. %$* 51
rather, they were a means to another broader goal – to terrify all of us and to sabotage our country’s democratic ideals of liberty and justice for all. %$* 51
sadly, the terrorists have made great strides toward that goal through the original 9/11 attacks – actually, more accurately, through our own government’s reaction to those attacks. %$* 51
that key point was well captured by some satiric but apt definitions from the nation magazine’s online dictionary of current political terminology. %$* 51
here are its two definitions of patriot act – sad but true. %$* 51
the first one is: the pre-emptive strike on american freedoms to prevent the terrorists from destroying them first. %$* 51
the second is: the elimination of one of the reasons why they hate us. %$* 51
in my limited time i can’t respond to all of the, uh, misguided, misleading statements you have heard tonight from my – with all due respect – to my opponents. %$* 51
um, but i’m going to start by briefly listing some of the major reasons for rejecting these kinds of measures. %$* 51
uh, first, i want to reiterate that we are not opposing, uh, surveillance per se but only surveillance that is not carried out in accordance with the constitution’s precepts. %$* 51
many leading law enforcement and national security experts confirm that such constitutionally appropriate surveillance is at least as effective as the illicit post-9/11 measures. %$* 51
and let me quote one of them, who has been very outspoken – judge william webster, who was director of both the fbi and the cia under presidents reagan and bush i – criticizing the sweeping post- 9/11 measures. %$* 51
he said, from 1981 to 2000 the fbi prevented more than one hundred thirty terrorist attacks. %$* 51
we used good investigative tech %$* 51
techniques and lawful techniques. %$* 51
we did it without all the suggestions that we’re going to jump all over people’s private lives. %$* 51
we don’t need to go in that direction. %$* 51
uh, second, the constitutional standards-- %$* 51
in particular the fourth amendment’s core requirement of individualized suspicion – uh, that is designed to preserve both safety and individual liberty. %$* 51
in contrast, too many post-9/11 surveillance programs are just overly broad, dragnets, fishing expeditions. %$* 51
and that means by definition, they are doubly flawed. %$* 51
on the one hand, they’re sweeping in too much information about too many completely innocent individuals, and on the other hand, they are failing to hone in on the dangerous ones. %$* 51
as many critics have put it, the government is trying to find a needle in the haystack, by adding more hay to the stack. %$* 51
uh, my next point is that by state-voting civil liberties, we are ignoring the more effective measures that would in fact, according to national security experts and counter-terrorism experts, be more effective as well as consistent with civil liberties. %$* 51
uh, since our opponents have referred to the 9/11 commission report, i have to say that i, uh, read that report completely differently, out of 41 specific recommendations of steps we should take to prevent another 9/11, almost none of them have anything to do with increasing the government’s surveillance power. %$* 51
and unfortunately, according to, uh, the report, with letter grades that was issued a couple of years after the initial recommendations, the government got d’s and f’s on most of the very significant, concrete recommendations, so we have not exhausted those, uh, alternatives that would help to make us both safe and free. %$* 51
unfortunately, the government now has gone in the opposite direction, uh, and if we increase this kind of surveillance, uh, we are going to have the worst of both worlds. %$* 51
because we will all be less free, but not more safe— %$* 51
one. %$* 44
uh, my next point is that by state-voting civil liberties, we are ignoring the more effective measures that would in fact, according to national security experts and counter-terrorism experts, be more effective as well as consistent with civil liberties. %$* 51
uh, since our opponents have referred to the 9/11 commission report, i have to say that i, uh, read that report completely differently, out of 41 specific recommendations of steps we should take to prevent another 9/11, almost none of them have anything to do with increasing the government’s surveillance power. %$* 51
and unfortunately, according to, uh, the report, with letter grades that was issued a couple of years after the initial recommendations, the government got d’s and f’s on most of the very significant, concrete recommendations, so we have not exhausted those, uh, alternatives that would help to make us both safe and free. %$* 51
unfortunately, the government now has gone in the opposite direction, uh, and if we increase this kind of surveillance, uh, we are going to have the worst of both worlds. %$* 51
nadine strossen— %$* 44
because we will all be less free, but not more safe— %$* 51
thank you very much. %$* 44
and thank you to all our panelists for their opening arguments today. %$* 44
i’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote to see where this audience stands coming into tonight’s debate. %$* 44
before the debate, 41 percent of you voted for the motion %$* 44
37 percent voted against the motion, and 22 percent were undecided, rounding up all those numbers. %$* 44
so we’re ready to begin the q-and-a portion of the program. %$* 44
the idea is to, uh, mix up some of your questions, some of my questions, and someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone so please stand if you want to ask a question. %$* 44
we ask again that you please make your questions brief and refrain from, um, giving, uh, speeches. %$* 44
members of the press, if you’re here tonight, please identify yourselves and your news organization, and members of the audience, you can opt out of, uh, that requirement. %$* 44
mr. %$* 44
mccarthy, i’d like you to, um, engage on a point, maybe with, with bob barr. %$* 44
you said that in an era of terror, that surveillance is the best defense that the country has. %$* 44
if in fact the war on terror is a war that is not finite, but a war that may last for decades, if not centuries, should the government’s power %$* 44
in such surveillance be open-ended, and i’d like a quick response and if, bob, you wanna pick up on that very point. %$* 44
well, of course it should because %$* 48
the purpose of the power is to prevent attacks, and as long as the threat of attack exists, it would make no sense to get rid of the power. %$* 48
so this is not a wartime power, you’re talking about permanent surveillance— %$* 44
it’s a threat-time power, it’s an asymmetric war, uh, fought by a terrorist threat, and these measures are designed, uh, as much to thwart the threat as they are to prevail in the ultimate war. %$* 48
bob? %$* 44
the current administration defines this war as unending, that is, perpetual. %$* 47
it defines it as entirely global, that is, the streets of baghdad are as much a field for the commander-in-chief to operate in as the streets of atlanta, georgia, nor your—or new york city. %$* 47
and this administration believes that a president can don that mythical commander-in-chief hat whenever he or she feels like it, and therefore, trumps any other power in the constitution or law. %$* 47
that is the great danger here. %$* 47
the greatest tool %$* 47
to— with which the government ought to be equipped to avoid another 9/11 is not domestic surveillance, which is the topic at hand this evening, but better, more consistent gathering of foreign intelligence, and tearing down the walls between one agency and another that pre—have prevented and continue to stand in the way of effective use of that intelligence, that foreign intelligence. %$* 47
john. %$* 44
chris, can— i just wanna take issue with the underlying premise of your question and, and bob’s response which is there’s no reason to think the war on terrorism is going to be endless. %$* 50
uh, there have been many wars between nation-states and terrorists before, and they have ended. %$* 50
uh, there’ve been wars in, uh, the united kingdom, italy, germany, with terrorists, and they have all come to an end. %$* 50
i think the problem is that we call it the war on terrorism so we think we’re at war with everyone who uses terrorism as a tactic, which is not the case, we are at war with the al qaeda terrorist organization, and organizations that help it. %$* 50
and when we defeat that organization the war will come to an end. %$* 50
may i have one—one sentence? %$* 46
i mean i want—because i think what bob—bob barr said is very important, notice he said he’s for enhanced foreign surveillance. %$* 46
but the moment this—that terrorist actually enters the united states, that’s when the surveillance must stop. %$* 46
because, i guess then you stop being dangerous. %$* 46
he’s not saying that it has to stop— %$* 51
no, no, no, nobo—nobody’s— %$* 47
that— %$* 46
—saying that, david— %$* 47
you want more, more— %$* 46
nobody’s saying that— %$* 47
—more surveillance up to the point— %$* 46
i didn’t say foreign surveillance— %$* 47
no more %$* 46
—i said foreign intelligence. %$* 47
well, we’re— %$* 46
none of us is saying— %$* 51
that’s the key— %$* 47
—no surveillance, we’re just saying subject to what kinds of oversight and what kinds of protections to make sure, that not only is it consistent with individual liberty but also— %$* 51
the opposite of— %$* 50
—that it’s promoting of national security— %$* 51
the opposite of more is less. %$* 50
but the exact— %$* 49
no, that’s not true. %$* 51
the balance that we’re— %$* 49
it’s more targeted which means it will be more effective— %$* 51
okay. %$* 44
may—now— %$* 44
the, the balance that—excuse me, the balance that we’re arguing for is precisely the one that prevailed before the patriot act, and we’re not taking issue with all of the patriot act, but with those provisions, mostly those dealing with national security letters and warrantless searches, that allow surveillance in secret, merely by asserting that it’s relevant to terrorism. %$* 49
the small reform that we’re arguing for is to restore the pre-patriot act requirement that the suspect has to be a suspected spy or terrorist or his associate. %$* 49
and the administration, in rejecting that simple reform, uh, has opposed sunset provisions, and made clear that it wishes these changes to be perpetual, so john’s notion that these will evaporate is inconsistent with the administration’s— %$* 49
but my, my ears— %$* 46
—determination to change domestic surveillance law forever— %$* 49
my ears are ringing at this phrase “targeted.” because, i will agree with you that many of the things the us government does including those bag searches, are stupid, and pointless. %$* 46
um, but the rea— precisely the reason, that ev—that everybody’s toiletries and magazine reading is on display when you enter an airplane, is, in order to avoid targeting. %$* 46
uh, that what—what—what the federal government has done since 9/11 is have a very conscious decision, they’re going to play—to use a sports analogy, they’re going to play the me—they’re going to play the players, they’re not going to pay—play the ball, and so we have— %$* 46
david, we’re not— %$* 51
—this vast, untargeted— %$* 46
no— %$* 51
—project, precisely because organizations like the aclu have opposed things like— %$* 46
i’m sorry— %$* 51
—the trusted traveler program— %$* 46
—you completely misunderstand our position, it depends what the basis is for targeting. %$* 51
individualized suspicion, based on what you do, not racial profiling based on who you are. %$* 51
but the aclu— %$* 46
and i have to say— %$* 51
—is opposed to the trusted traveler program, right— %$* 46
—law enforcement officials have agreed, that demographic profiling is as ineffective as it is violative of individual rights, because— %$* 51
there’s as many law enforcement— %$* 48
—the terrorists can get around the profile very easily— %$* 51
there’s—there’s as many law enforcement officers who disagree with that as dis—as disagree with it. %$* 48
well, uh— %$* 51
and your flat statement that the fourth amendment requires individualized suspicion is just wrong. %$* 48
okay, before we get too deep into the woods %$* 44
of the, the constitution, um, i know we have some folks who, uh, have some questions, so, uh, if you’re ready, there’s somebody with a microphone standing by, so, uh, who do we have. %$* 44
a young woman in %$* 44
in the back right there. %$* 44
oh, i’m sorry, no, go ahead, if you— %$* 44
no, no, i’m sorry— %$* 10
whoever gets the microphone first, please, you’re on. %$* 44
how do we know—how do we have proof that someone’s a terrorist until they commit a terrorist act? %$* 10
would you like to direct that to— %$* 44
jeffrey rosen— %$* 10
—one side or one panelist— %$* 44
uh, foreign intelligence law since it—the, uh, law was passed in the 1970s presumes that, uh, there’s a level of suspicion that stops short of probable cause that someone’s committed a crime, but makes pretty clear that we think of this as a really bad person. %$* 49
and, uh, this was a balance that no one suggested, uh, caused 9/11, and what’s so interesting about the other side is their, uh, failure to say that that standard is too high. %$* 49
there’s no evidence that anyone wasn’t the object of a fisa warrant because there wasn’t a high enough degree of suspicion. %$* 49
they’re—they wanna completely throw out individualized suspicion, and have hundreds and thousands of warrants for, uh, people who just happened to show up at the airport. %$* 49
so this is not a subtle, uh, uh, uh, distinction, and we’re convinced that by resurrecting that simple requirement— you could even broaden it a little bit, if you wanna talk about the technical details, there’ve been thoughtful civil libertarians who have said, you could have probable cause that someone’s a suspected spy or terrorist, or his or her associates. %$* 49
at least some connection to an identifiable, dangerous bad guy. %$* 49
and— %$* 51
it’s the dragnet searches that are, uh, threatening and, and the other side has provided no justification— %$* 49
and the %$* 51
let’s let the other side, john had a point here. %$* 44
first of all, i think it’s a great question because, under the current law within the united states, as jeff said, you need to have probable cause that someone’s a terrorist before you can slap a wiretap on ‘em, and it shows a fundamental confusion between how we think of terrorism. %$* 50
i think the other side thinks of it as a crime, and as best handled through the standard criminal justice system which is this probable cause approach. %$* 50
makes a lotta sense when as a society, we are willing to accept the harms of terrorism and retrospectively, after it occurs, then try to use a law enforcement system. %$* 50
what 9/11 showed us is that, our government is trying to act prospectively to stop terrorist attacks before they occur. %$* 50
and in order to do that we cannot rely on a system which says, prove to me that this person is already a terrorist because of criminal actions they have already engaged in, because at that point, usually, as we saw in 9/11, they are already dead, and there’s no one to hold responsible in the criminal justice system— %$* 50
and as—as john himself knows, that is absolutely not the standard, it is much watered down, as andy said, the court has not applied the strict fourth amendment probable cause requirement in this context but required just some basis for suspicion. %$* 51
and let me tell you, the opposite danger, not only to individual rights but to national security, the fbi has been complaining bitterly about this sweeping national security agency, uh, intercepts because it has led to countless hours of wasted time, tracking down, quote, leads, that lead nowhere, to dead ends, so again, the notion of honing in on somebody, as to whom we have some basis for having suspicion, is more effective from the security point of view, as well as from an individual rights point of view. %$* 51
nadine is again demonstrating the difference between a law enforcement mind-set and a criminal justice mind-set. %$* 48
uh, if you wait until you have probable cause that someone is an agent of a foreign power, you have waited too long. %$* 48
uh, and that may be what the, the standard is in the criminal justice system, that may be what’s appropriate in the criminal justice system, but the fourth amendment has never required that, what the fourth amendment requires, is that searches be reasonable. %$* 48
and if our goal is going to be to stop terrorist acts, rather than to bring people to justice, that has to be the standard that we deal with, and we have to do with an intelligence mind-set, which is far different from the criminal mind-set, when the fbi investigates a crime, they expect to bat about .900.they expect that most of the time when they conduct an investigation they’re gonna get their man, uh, and they’re gonna successfully prosecute him. %$* 48
intelligence doesn’t work that way. %$* 48
if you hit one for 15, you’re probably doing well. %$* 48
but it’s chasing the needle in the haystack that intelligence is about, and if you’re gonna apply criminal justice standards to that task, you’re finished because— %$* 48
how about three— %$* 51
—you can’t prevent anything— %$* 48
—how about three out of 153,000— %$* 51
let’s move off this point— %$* 44
—to use the nsl numbers— %$* 51
—just for a few seconds, we have another question, yes sir, from the audience right there on the, on the end, yes. %$* 44
there you go. %$* 44
yes, sir— %$* 9
this is a question for the, uh, people against the motion, would you—i—any of you feel the slightest bit differently about this proposition if you either trusted the administration or felt that they were competent in the performance of their duties? %$* 9
we took exactly the same position as did bob barr with respect to the, uh, last so-called anti-terrorism act under the clinton administration. %$* 51
um, and i do have to say that the opponents here are, uh, completely ideologically neutral and very diverse. %$* 51
um, libertarians, civil libertarians join forces with a lot of, uh, conservative organizations that really are committed to reducing government power over our private lives. %$* 51
and, it’s because the impulse of government is necessarily to increase its power, regardless of, uh, what their politics are. %$* 51
we had a long litany from john yoo about, um, past administrations including some human rights heroes in other contexts, franklin delano roosevelt, abraham lincoln— in a wartime situation, they all react the same way which is to expand their power to the con— constitutional limit, and beyond, and in 20/20 hindsight, we look back and we see that none of those measures did anything, to add actual protection to our national security. %$* 51
nadine, what about the common-sense argument, advocated by the other side that, americans are more than willing to give up some liberties whether they’re going to a yankee game or whether they’re going through the airport security, do you see a fundamental difference between that and surveillance on the part of the, of the government. %$* 44
i think the common-sense argument, speaking for myself and also it’s actually reflected in constitutional doctrine is that, no freedom is absolute except probably the freedom to think and to believe which stays entirely within your heart, head and soul, but, in acting in the real world, no right is absolute. %$* 51
it’s just that government has a heavy burden of justification. %$* 51
it has to show that the restriction is gonna be effective in actually making you safer, and that nothing that is less violative of your rights would be as effective. %$* 51
and, think about it. %$* 51
of course, most of us would be willing to give up some liberty if that was the price to pay to bring about security. %$* 51
but how many of us would be willing to give up liberty, without gaining security in return? %$* 51
is that common sense? %$* 51
or to give up more liberty than we have to, in order to get the same amount of security. %$* 51
well, how about this proposal. %$* 46
what if we were to say, why don’t we let, not only people choose, but let each person make their own individual choice about how much they personally were prepared to do. %$* 46
for example, if you wanna fly, um, you can have a shorter line if you’re prepared to let the airline know more about you, and a longer line if you’re prepared to know— we could each make our choice. %$* 46
and civil liberties un—groups, have consistently fought and fought and fought, when airlines—american airlines has been promising this now for three years. %$* 46
and we could each—we could let the market decide, and you could be in the long line, and i’m happy to let them know how long i’m—i’ve been in my present abode and how many kids i have and i’ll go in the short line. %$* 46
and i have no illusion, as somebody who flies a couple hundred thousand miles a year and has no desire to die, uh, that way, i have no illusion that that would do anything other than save me time. %$* 51
i have no illusion that would make me safer. %$* 51
how many of the 9/11 terrorists had valid id’s. %$* 51
how many of them would’ve sailed through, uh, and been treated as trusted travelers themselves— %$* 51
they—they had—they had fake driver’s licenses, many of them— %$* 46
yeah— %$* 51
—under, uh, under— %$* 46
and those would—that would’ve been enough to get them there, every security expert says that this is false—gives us a false illusion of security, it— %$* 51
you’d have to give ‘em a little bit more than a driver’s license, you’d have to give ‘em a whole battery of information, and the airlines, under the threat of litigation— %$* 46
ask any teenager about how easy it is to get a false id. %$* 51
okay, so the point is, you don’t—your answer is, no, we will not let people make that individual choice, we will not allow airlines and their customers as private actors to say, let’s, let’s put this to a truly personal individual trade-off test. %$* 46
but we’re not talking about market choices, you can’t opt out of a database with 100,000 people in it. %$* 49
and obviously people react, uh, intuitively to the place where the security hits them, so if they have to wait a little longer they’ll make the trade-off. %$* 49
the so-called security. %$* 51
but what we’re talking about here, are fundamental changes in laws and technologies that make it impossible to escape from dragnet and ubiquitous surveillance, and, and transform the very nature of society. %$* 49
and this is something just as in, in environmental law, where, uh, market choices are completely inadequate, and that’s why constitutional values, whether or not you think that this stuff is required by the constitution, or implicated. %$* 49
but jeffrey, doesn’t that argue for what the proponents are, are saying, that the technology has changed so much, and you have government agencies who are mining hundreds of thousands of communications, uh, in, in literally nanoseconds, doesn’t that make it, um, almost impossible for probable cause, warrants, uh, and, and court orders to, uh, to get at this information. %$* 44
it makes it easier, you don’t have to show up at a magistrate’s, uh, office and read, uh, a warrant in person, you can e-mail or blackberry a request, to a secret court which could grant it immediately. %$* 49
or you could have programmatic warrants that would say, this broad category of person looks suspicious. %$* 49
there is great familiarity in foreign intelligence surveillance law in dealing with broad, uh, categories of data mining and so forth. %$* 49
what’s unprecedented about the patriot act, and what the previous question smoked out is that, much of the patriot act was actually proposed by the clinton and bush administration after oklahoma city, and opposed by the same heroic bipartisan coalition led by my, uh, colleagues, that are less successful after the, uh, uh, 9/11. but it would be, uh, they provided no reason for why that framework wouldn’t be just as effective, you could have broad surveillance, it just wouldn’t be unlimited, and the unlimited surveillance is ineffective, and threat—it threatens privacy— %$* 49
we’ve got about five minutes left in the q-and-a so we have some questions, yes, sir, right here— %$* 44
to, to—this is really addressed to the, the panel against the motion. %$* 9
what, what seems to be missing in your argument is a lack of, of, of addressing the nature of the threat. %$* 9
the threat seems to me %$* 9
is that our terrorists today have technology too and they have technology that %$* 9
affects the existential nature of our society. %$* 9
and don’t you believe, that there should be at least some moderation in your point of view and flexibility, relative to the threat that you’re confronting. %$* 9
so that it’s one thing to protect, uh, individual rights, when a relatively limited threat exists. %$* 9
but when you’re talking about an existential threat to the nation %$* 9
to millions of people, don’t you have to suspend, at the very least, this firm, rigorous approach? %$* 9
that’s my question— %$* 9
uh, the, the, the threat to our, to our nation at the time the bill of rights was drawn up and adopted by this nation, was far greater than the threats we face today, i dare say, we faced at the time, the very protections against unlimited government intrusion that are embodied for example in the fourth amendment, uh, were such that the very existence of our nation was clearly threatened by the greatest military power on the face of the earth, not a handful of cells but a military power that could wipe us off the face of the earth as a sovereign nation, that is great britain. %$* 47
in the face of that overwhelming threat, our founding fathers in— understood that the answer to your question is no, government should not, even facing the most dire threat to this nation, allow %$* 47
or the people should not allow government, even facing that level of threat, to invade their privacy without a sufficient reason. %$* 47
and indeed, there is great flexibility, that you mention, already embodied in the foreign intelligence surveillance act. %$* 47
great flexibility. %$* 47
there is tremendous flexibility built into the patriot act, already. %$* 47
and yet the other side is arguing by the terms of the question here this evening %$* 47
is that insufficient, and should government have, essentially unfettered power. %$* 47
and the answer to that, should be no, the same as it was no in the 18th century when these very precious mechanisms for guaranteeing our, our inherent rights were crafted. %$* 47
john, i think i’d like you to respond to that because you were instrumental in crafting the administration’s legal opinion on that very point about whether the president could go beyond the foreign intelligence surveillance court, and without any warrants at all, eavesdrop not only on the foreign %$* 44
agents, but on people inside the united states. %$* 44
there—there are two things going on here. %$* 50
first of all, with the patriot act, which is not the focus of your question, focus of your question. %$* 50
there is a system of secret courts and secret evidence that issues secret warrants for secret wiretaps. %$* 50
that system was created was created in 1978.the patriot act amended some of those provisions, but the basic structure is one that we’ve been happy to live with, for almost 30 years. %$* 50
and so, this claim that the patriot act was this huge revolution i think is, is mistaken. %$* 50
the second thing i would say is, in terms of the ability of the president to go beyond the patriot act, that’s based on history, as i said. %$* 50
every president—and as andrew said, every president from woodrow wilson on, used exactly those same authorities, when confronted by a foreign attack or foreign threat, we’re not arguing here for unfettered power, we’re not arguing that these powers ought to be used in peacetime, we’re not arguing that these powers ought to be used to catch common criminals. %$* 50
i’m—i actually personally don’t think any evidence from those, uh, surveillance programs should be entered into court in any kind of criminal prosecution— %$* 50
so, do you— %$* 51
they are there, to try to prevent a future attack. %$* 50
and it seems— and this is really david’s key point. %$* 50
it seems weird, right? %$* 50
if you’re outside the united states and you’re a terrorist, the nsa has unlimited ability to track—you don’t have to go to court and get a warrant, to o—to surveil osama bin laden, if osama bin laden were to move to the united states, then, a whole system of court-ordered procedures are required under the other side’s framework. %$* 50
that is a perverse— %$* 50
but that’s not— %$* 51
—and exactly reverse incentive— %$* 50
let’s not exaggerate— %$* 51
—to one we should be creating— %$* 50
—court-ordered procedures from a court that has almost never denied anything the government has asked for in a secret proceedings which also has the power— and the government has the power to engage in surveillance before getting a court order, but john, the most striking thing in your answer, was your statement that these ex— to quote john ashcroft, had a different view, he described the patriot act as giving the government sweeping, new surveillance powers, that was his exact quote. %$* 51
i can give you a citation— %$* 51
i’m not defending ashcroft— %$* 50
okay— %$* 51
—uh, today— %$* 50
well, he had a different view of the scope of the— %$* 51
but didn’t you work for him? %$* 44
and, and— %$* 51
i—i did, but it wasn’t pleasant— %$* 50
and, and— %$* 51
and i certainly would never have been promoted, to speechwriter. %$* 50
um, and, and, and you—and you know that the government has shown that it has used most of those sweeping new powers in ordinary criminal cases, uh, fraud, gambling, drug crimes. %$* 51
i’m not condoning any of those crimes, but, isn’t it interesting to hear you say, that you oppose the way it has mostly been used in fact? %$* 51
i don’t think it’s—the nsa wiretapping program has not been used to prosecute garden-variety cri—i mean i could be— %$* 50
we’re talking about the patriot act. %$* 51
remember the nsa went beyond— %$* 51
see, that—that’s what i’m trying to make clear that— %$* 50
—and around and underneath the patriot act— %$* 51
most of you, i thought you all just said the patriot act was something, most of which you supported, some of which you didn’t, but i thought we were talking about the nsa wiretapping program where there is a very clear distinction about what that evidence can be sought for and it’s not to be used for criminal prosecutions and as far as i know, has yet to—it never has been used for criminal prosecutions— %$* 50
we—we don’t know what it’s been used for because it’s been entirely secret and the government has refused to tell us what it is. %$* 49
well, wait— %$* 48
but we do know that the evidence from the national security letters has been used in ordinary criminal prosecutions, in fact the inspector general found that there’d been at most two terrorism-related convictions, but about 30, which was out of 140,000 letters, only 30 other criminal convictions, for crimes that had nothing to do with terrorism. %$* 49
i have to say, the gentleman earlier asked, would you give up nothing. %$* 49
i would make a deal with john, he says, uh, give us this broad, warrantless surveillance power, but we can only use it, uh, for intelligence and we can’t introduce it in criminal prosecution, i would take that deal. %$* 49
that’s a deal that the germans have struck, they allow broad, uh, intelligence powers, but it can’t be used for prosecutions, and for me, that’s an example of the thoughtful balancing of privacy and security, that allows us to have both at the same time but, but every time the administration has been presented with this deal, it has been, uh, completely adamant, it’s refused to, uh, make those sensible trade-offs, and that’s why you have to vote against their position— %$* 49
just, just about 20 seconds left, and it, it sounds on the face of it like a reasonable deal. %$* 44
it’s the law of the united states, it’s long been the law of the united states that if agents are searching for a legitimate reason, if they have lawful reason to be searching what they’re searching, uh, you can use the evidence even if it’s not what they were looking for in the first place. %$* 48
now i’m not saying that it’s not a— the possibility of a reasonable compromise. %$* 48
but the suggestion that it’s an unreasonable position not to wanna negotiate that is, is, is—i, i just have to disagree with that. %$* 48
andrew, thank you very much, and that ends the discussion %$* 44
portion of our evening. %$* 44
and now we’re gonna have the final remarks from our panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion. %$* 44
and panelists for this, if you’d just please stay, um, seated. %$* 44
you’ll each have, uh, two minutes to make your closing statement, and we’ll start speaking against the motion, bob barr. %$* 44
thank you. %$* 47
i had the opportunity in april of 2000 to testify, before the house intelligence committee, on the issue of whether or not the national security agency or nsa engaged in or should engage in, electronic surveillance of us persons within the united states without court order. %$* 47
my position was that the foreign intelligence surveillance act which is the law of the land, required warrants in such instances. %$* 47
there was another gentleman that testified that very same day on the very same issue. %$* 47
general mike hayden. %$* 47
at the time, head of the nsa. now, another star on his shoulders, four on each side, head of the cia. he testified, that day, according to the foreign intelligence surveillance act, if in fact our government deems it appropriate or necessary to conduct electronic surveillance %$* 47
of a us person in this country, the government is required to, always has, and will, secure a court order. %$* 47
because that is the law of the land and the nsa obeys and abides by the law of the land. %$* 47
strange. %$* 47
that law, in its operative parts remains the law of the land today. %$* 47
yet that same man, now takes a very different attitude. %$* 47
there’s been no declaration of war %$* 47
what has changed is simply the perception that now, because of 9/11 %$* 47
the president can order those under him to violate the law because he deems it appropriate and necessary in his perception of his role, as commander-in-chief. %$* 47
fact of the matter is, folks, we are a nation that has a bill of rights, it cannot be and should never be allowed to be trumped by those seven words that the president serves as commander-in-chief. %$* 47
the bill of rights is the bill of rights. %$* 47
it prevails. %$* 47
bob barr— %$* 44
in the sense of privacy that it protects, ought not to be frittered away, by granting the government yet more power in addition to the vast power that it already has. %$* 47
thank you— %$* 47
thank you for your closing remark. %$* 44
and in his final rebuttal arguing for the motion, david frum. %$* 44
i want you to notice as you think about how you’re going to vote, the, both the abstract and the radical character of the arguments of the people on the other side. %$* 46
they’re abstract, in that they have not given you one example of what you yourselves as individuals ought to be afraid of. %$* 46
what is this tremendous incursion. %$* 46
now i ask you to think about this to think, do i feel less free to speak my mind. %$* 46
do i feel that there are thing—that there are secrets that are important to me, that are more in danger of exposure now than they were before. %$* 46
and then i ask you to consider, how many terrorist attacks have there been on us soil since 9/11, and what is the terrible record, through the 1990s, from the first attack on the world trade center in 1993, to the—to the attack in 2001.uh, i want you also to notice how radical their claim is. %$* 46
we are not debating that better limitless surveillance, better surveillance at the sole discretion of the president, better lawless surveillance. %$* 46
what we are saying is, better the higher level of surveillance that has prevailed since 9/11, than this risk. %$* 46
better, more. %$* 46
they have—they have—uh, they, their argument, is %$* 46
complete—is, is not modulated, it is not balanced, it is to say that, nothing, there is to be, there is to be no more. %$* 46
i sometimes think, as i, as i’ve been listening to this argument, what would they have said, had they been present at the introduction of the stop sign. %$* 46
they would’ve looked at it and said, this is the first step on the slippery slope toward the total abolition of motion. %$* 46
no one will ever be able to go anywhere ever again. %$* 46
the, the—what we are debating here, is more and less. %$* 46
we are debating balance. %$* 46
um, i think that, when we identify, as we surely will, specific problems and abuses that have appeared since 9/11, they ought to be fixed. %$* 46
of course they ought to be fixed, and that is why this original patriot act was sunsetted, that is why, uh, congress, uh, has oversight powers, of course they—those things must be addressed. %$* 46
but what—we must do this with an understanding of danger. %$* 46
we must ask ourselves, when we look back at that world before 9/11, when people— %$* 46
david— %$* 44
—the same agency were not even allowed to talk to each other about what they knew. %$* 46
is that what we wanna return to? %$* 46
david frum, thank you. %$* 44
thank you. %$* 46
and against the motion, jeffrey rosen. %$* 44
we don’t need lectures on radicalism from the other side. %$* 49
this was the administration, led by our, uh, distinguished opponents, who argue that the president has the unilateral authority to ignore or reinterpret laws including the foreign intelligence surveillance law, with which he disagrees, because it infringes his power as commander-in-chief. %$* 49
uh, and this is the administration that has indeed used the broad and sweeping, new and radical powers that it’s been granted, which were a warrant for unreviewed, uh, limitless surveillance by the fbi, in ways that have nothing to do with terrorism. %$* 49
uh, they are the radicals, our position is the traditionally conservative, uh, position. %$* 49
we really wanna resort the law as it was, uh, before the patriot act, we’re willing to engage in the kind of sempr—sensible compromises that came out, uh, in the debates, we are not uncompromising at all in this regard. %$* 49
but we want to avoid a transformation in american, uh, liberties from which the country might never recover. %$* 49
uh, david frum asked for an a—a specific example, uh, i’m happy to provide one and to close with one and that’s the example of britain. %$* 49
britain, the cradle of western democracy, was the country that wired itself up in the 1990s, with so many surveillance cameras that it now resembles the threat—uh, the set of the truman show. %$* 49
uh, this was defended as a way of stopping ira terrorism, but the cameras are now used for very different purposes. %$* 49
they’re used to charge a car tax for every car that comes into the city, and recently we learned, microphones have been set up in city centers, to have ominous voices warning people when they’re getting drunk in public. %$* 49
i—i was, uh, i experienced a society that had microphones and surveillance cameras, and that was, uh, in warsaw in 1988 right before the berlin— the fall of the berlin wall. %$* 49
uh, and the british public is indifferent to statistics showing that there is no connection between the spread of the cameras and the decline and prevention of violent crime, or terrorism. %$* 49
so these things are indeed small incursions, and even free societies can transform themselves incrementally, in ways whose effects are only beginning to be understood. %$* 49
and in a world where it’s possible to track people from door to door, and to, uh, store that in ubiquitous databases, ubiquitous surveillance that might make it possible to see where it get up in the morning and which subway i take and— %$* 49
jeffrey— %$* 44
—where i end up going to work, uh, is not, uh, an orwellian possibility, but a very real probability, and we ask you to resist it by voting against the motion. %$* 49
jeffrey rosen, thank you. %$* 44
and his closing thought for the motion, andrew mccarthy. %$* 44
with due respect to the other side, what you’re hearing is radical. %$* 48
um, we now have increased surveillance. %$* 48
we’ve had it since 9/11, i don’t think it’s sweepingly increased surveillance, but it’s certainly increased surveillance beyond what we had in the 1990s. %$* 48
what they’re telling you, is better another 9/11 than increased surveillance. %$* 48
now, this is new york. %$* 48
ask yourself, what have you been going through for the last five years, six years, um, whether it’s keeping you up at night that, uh, the government is, uh, uh %$* 48
frittering away with, with your personal information or whatever else is that, uh, that is the grave concern here. %$* 48
and ask you, ask yourself, if that’s anything like what 9/11 was like. %$* 48
and whether in a million years, you would ever, ever wanna go through anything like that again, uh, if you could instead, uh, deal with the kinds of, uh, trade-offs between liberty and security that we’ve had in the last six years. %$* 48
that’s not even a contest. %$* 48
and to say that it is, that’s about as radical as anything i can imagine. %$* 48
now one of the, one of the, last thing i’d like to address is, this idea of perfect security and, and, risk of error. %$* 48
investigation whether it’s law enforcement or, or, uh, national security, is a human process, and we are not going to be able to repeal human error. %$* 48
there are going to continue to be errors, there are gonna continue to be, uh, roguish acts by people who are rogues. %$* 48
rogues are gonna be rogues, no matter what the rules are. %$* 48
when you change the rules, when you, when you, uh %$* 48
clamp down on what your agents are able to do, what you’re actually clamping down on, are the good-faith people who you didn’t need to worry about in the first place. %$* 48
um, these powers are in place because they’re needed, uh, to ferret out potential threats, because there is no perfect security, we can line—we can wire the whole place up with cameras and, uh, and bugs and the like— %$* 48
andrew. %$* 44
—but we can’t prevent every attack. %$* 48
thank you. %$* 44
andrew mccarthy, thank you. %$* 44
and her closing thought, nadine strossen. %$* 44
i’m afraid that andy has not understood our position at all. %$* 51
our position is that more surveillance of the sweeping, random, mass, dragnet type we are complaining about, and security experts are complaining about post-9/11, is not going to prevent another 9/11, and in fact not only is it ineffective, but it is actually counterproductive to the security goal because it is deterring and diverting resources for measures that the com—and security community has a consensus would be more effective. %$* 51
let me give you a couple specific examples. %$* 51
the mass gathering of data about all of our communications. %$* 51
the government tells us it’s gonna engage in data-mining. %$* 51
sounds really impressive, doesn’t it. %$* 51
of course we would like to believe it would work. %$* 51
well you know who knows that it doesn’t work? %$* 51
security experts and computer experts. %$* 51
let me quote one. %$* 51
professor farley at harvard university, who is a science fellow at stanford’s center for international security. %$* 51
complaining, from a security perspective, about the nsa domestic spying program, he says it is based on a false assumption, that you can work out who might be a terrorist based on calling patterns. %$* 51
but guilt by association is not just bad law, it’s also bad mathematics. %$* 51
security theater, not real security. %$* 51
and, you know, we put in place understandably, the patriot act, nsa, domestic spying, shortly after 9/11, government officials to their credit wanted to do something to at least make us feel more secure. %$* 51
but you can’t do anything meaningful, until you have looked at what the actual causes were, of that horrible catastrophe on 9/11.and that kind of analysis was not done until much later, by the joint intelligence committees of both houses of congress, and by the bipartisan citizens commission. %$* 51
and they did not recommend the kind of mass surveillance measures that have been advocated by our proponents. %$* 51
and in fact, again, the common-sense, concrete steps that all of us blithely assume have been taken, have not in fact been taken. %$* 51
uh, john yoo said, well, we’ve already done all of that, well, that’s not what tom kean— %$* 51
nadine— %$* 44
—thinks, uh, the chair of the 9/11 commission. %$* 51
he says it is scandalous that police and firefighters in large cities, still cannot communicate reliably in a major crisis. %$* 51
we oppose— %$* 51
nadine strossen— %$* 44
—the resolution, because it is bad for security, and freedom. %$* 51
thank you. %$* 44
and now, batting clean-up for the proponents, john yoo. %$* 44
well, um, first i wanna apologize for the lack of rhetorical skills on at least my part, that should not prevent you from voting for our side in the debate. %$* 50
i’ve just admired the rhetorical gifts of everyone else on the panel, and that—from what i can tell that consists of calling the other side radical and exaggerating what they actually wanna do in the real world. %$* 50
um, clearly i’m not an expert at this, i did not get the note about the dark suit, which is really the only thing i noticed listening to everybody’s discussion. %$* 50
two things, one is i think the other side fundamentally confuses war versus crime. %$* 50
ask yourself this. %$* 50
if the soviet union had carried out the 9/11 attacks in exactly the same way, exactly same people, would we not be at war? %$* 50
and would we not be justified in using wartime measures to try to stop al qaeda from carrying out a second attack. %$* 50
why does the fact that they are not a nation-state require us to go back to criminal justice in the pre-9/11 world? %$* 50
the second thing i’ll just say is, it’s an empirical question whether the, the security of our country has gone up in response to the increased surveillance measures, i think it has. %$* 50
there’s the person who wanted to blow—blow up—blow up the brooklyn bridge, there’s too many b’s there, so i’m not good at this. %$* 50
the guy who wanted to blow—blow up the brooklyn bridge was caught only because of these new measures. %$* 50
the guy who wanted to carry out terrorist attacks in florida and southeast amer—uh, the united states who fled the country. %$* 50
he was only identified, and an alert went out only because he was identified using expanded surveillance techniques. %$* 50
so there’s still more we can do. %$* 50
one thing i would like to do as—end as we began. %$* 50
i think the fbi’s utterly incompetent, it’s because, they try to do drug-dealing, white-collar crime which i’m sure is of interest to many of you in new york, and all kinds of other things, and counter-terrorism. %$* 50
the reason we keep them all together is out of civil-liberty concerns, i would say let’s get rid of the fbi, create a real national security counter-terrorist agency and let the states and the plo—the states control drug crimes, white- collar crimes, and get the fbi out of the job of trying to do bank robberies and kidnappings. %$* 50
i think that makes no sense. %$* 50
that’s an improvement we can make, but would require you to vote for our side. %$* 50
and right on time, we like that. %$* 44
that concludes the closing arguments, now it’s time for you, the jury, to vote once again. %$* 44
so, look for that keypad, the thing that looks like a calculator, uh, on your arm-rest, this thing, uh %$* 44
right here. %$* 44
and, uh, we’re not gonna confuse you by changing the code, at this %$* 44
late stage. %$* 44
you may be confused enough, i don’t know. %$* 44
so, after my prompt, please press 1 if you are for the motion, press 2 if you are against the motion, or 3 if you are undecided, 1 for, 2 against, 3 undecided, please go ahead and press your buttons now. %$* 44
we need a little “jeopardy” music here, da-da-da %$* 44
i wanna thank the debaters and audience for their participation tonight. %$* 44
and before i announce the results of the final vote, to see who has swayed whom, we need to take care of some business. %$* 44
first, the next intelligence squared u.s.debate will take place on wednesday, may 16th here at the asia society and museum. %$* 44
the motion to be debated next month is, “beware the dragon—a booming china spells trouble for america.” sounds like a good one, unfortunately the debate is sold out. %$* 44
but, the good news is that, packages for the fall 2007-spring 2008 series are on sale right now, on-line and by phone. %$* 44
so avoid disappointment and buy those series packages now. %$* 44
um, tonight’s debate by the way can be heard locally, on wnyc am-820 on friday, april 27th, at 2 p.m., and some point after that it will be heard on hundreds of npr stations across the country, no exaggerations. %$* 44
copies of some of the panelists’ books are for sale, uh, upstairs in the lobby. %$* 44
and, uh %$* 44
i think, david, you’ve got a book out, right? %$* 44
and, uh, john has got, uh, a book, and jeffrey, so, at least three of our %$* 44
war by any other name, is that it, something like that— %$* 44
just the white one. %$* 50
buy the white one. %$* 50
so, um, if you wanna help out our panelists in another way, uh, buy their books upstairs. %$* 44
you can also purchase dvd’s from previous debates here tonight, or from the intelligence squared u.s.website. %$* 44
and finally, please be sure to pick up—it sounds like we’re selling things here, doesn’t it? %$* 44
uh, please be sure to pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of the times of london, and the times literary supplement, as you leave the auditorium, but i think those are free. %$* 44
and now, what we have all been waiting for, after our debaters worked so hard to sway you, um, you decided %$* 44
after the debate %$* 44
39.5 percent were for the motion. %$* 44
so a—a bit of a, uh %$* 44
uh, a bit of a movement, toward your direction. %$* 44
after the debate, 55.6 percent were against the motion. %$* 44
so, um %$* 44
that’s %$* 44
and undecided %$* 44
this shows you how good our panelists were, undecided, less than 5 percent. %$* 44
so. %$* 44
congratulations %$* 44
which means that, uh, those against have carried the day. %$* 44
so our sincere—sincere appreciation for you to being a wonderful audience, and thank you, panelists, we appreciate it, thanks. %$* 44
thank you. %$* 44
well done. %$* 32

“intelligence squared u.s.” “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” a another 9/11” %$* 44
. and to begin the program, i would like to introduce robert rosenkranz, chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of this evening’s debate. %$* 45
well, thank you for that polite applause. %$* 1
it’s really my pleasure and honor to, uh, to welcome you all tonight, this is the seventh debate in our inaugural series of public policy debates, “intelligence squared,” i’m the chairman of intelligence squared, which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 1
uh, as chris said, these proceedings are, uh, produced for radio by wnyc, and broadcast nationally through npr.we’re also thankful to our sponsor, the times of london. %$* 1
well, to what extent should we trade privacy for security? %$* 1
our society’s one that values civil liberty so highly that in the words of justice cardozo, um %$* 1
if a constable blunders, the criminal goes free. %$* 1
but what is that saying, it’s that the need to incentivize the constable to follow the rules is more important to our society than justice for the individual criminal, or compassion for his victim. %$* 1
but, we also value security a great deal also. %$* 1
uh, 9/11 presented an unprecedented type of threat. %$* 1
it’s clear that there are terrorists out there who will inflict the, the %$* 1
deadliest kind of means at their disposal, to, to create grievous harm for civilians here. %$* 1
and, uh, the traditional legal framework of dealing with soldiers or dealing with criminals, uh, was never created with that kind of threat in mind. %$* 1
so it’s, it’s sort of self-evident, uh, that the lines that were drawn prior to 9/11 must be drawn differently. %$* 1
but the question is how differently. %$* 1
and one would expect a lively national debate on an issue of this kind of importance, it’s very timely. %$* 1
in the news recently has been scrutiny of international banking transactions. %$* 1
uh, wiretaps without warrants. %$* 1
just in the last week or so, there’ve been proposed renewal and revisions of, of fisa, the fed— foreign intelligence, uh, surveillance act. %$* 1
but the debate on these kinds of issues has been somewhat clouded by a, a, %$* 1
general skepticism i would say of the bush administration both in terms of its competence and judgment. %$* 1
and, uh, our hope tonight is really to transcend, uh, partisan bickering, transcend ideology, because getting the trade-off between privacy and security right, demands reasoned discourse. %$* 1
and our lives may depend upon it. %$* 1
so, uh, it’s now my real pleasure to turn the evening over to the stellar panelists that, uh, uh, that dana wolfe our executive producer has put together this evening. %$* 1
our moderator is chris bury, who’s known to you all from abc news “nightline.” he’s reported extensively on national politics and policy issues including the intelligence community. %$* 1
he anchored “nightline” from afghanistan, from centcom war headquarters, and in a network first, from the fort meade headquarters of the national security agency. %$* 1
he’s earned five emmy awards for his work on “nightline,” received columbia university dupont honors for his reporting on “world news tonight,” so i’m pleased to add the au—hand the evening over to chris bury. %$* 1
thank you, bob, for that kind introduction. %$* 44
and i’d like to thank you as well for your considerable efforts to raise the substance, elevate the substance and the tone of public conversation on, on matters of public policy, we’re all grateful for that, thank you. %$* 44
now i would like to welcome you officially to the seventh intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 44
i’ll give you a brief rundown of how things are gonna go this evening. %$* 44
first the proposers of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument, “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.” the opposition will follow. %$* 44
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes, and we’ll go back and forth between the two sides. %$* 44
each speaker will get a notice from me with one minute to go. %$* 44
and debaters, when you get that one-minute warning it really is time to wrap things up, because when your time has come, it is my job to cut you off with all the mercy of robespierre at the guillotine. %$* 44
not to be rude but because this is a radio broadcast and we’re gonna try to keep the trains, uh, running on time here. %$* 44
second, when all speakers are finished with their opening remarks, i’m gonna follow up and try to get you going with some civil exchange. %$* 44
and then we’re gonna open up the floor to the audience, and for audience members, uh, we’d ask you to keep your questions short and, uh, to the point, you may wanna direct them at an individual panelist or you may want to direct them at one particular side of, of the argument. %$* 44
we ask that you refrain from giving speeches, we just don’t have the time. %$* 44
after the q-and-a, each debater will make a final statement, lasting not longer than two minutes. %$* 44
and after the final closing argument you will vote on tonight’s motion, with the keypad which is attached to the arm-rest of your seat. %$* 44
finally i will announce the results of the audience vote, and tell you which of these sides has carried the day. %$* 44
for those of you who have attended previous debates, you probably had one of those little cards, and let me see if i, if i have one here, you’re probably used to this. %$* 44
um, tonight we’re gonna try something new, and, uh, vote with an electronic system. %$* 44
and, uh, i think diebold made it so there shouldn’t be any problem at all %$* 44
but we will ask for your patience because, uh, this is a virgin attempt at this electronic system. %$* 44
and so, uh, let’s find a—here we go, the— it looks like a little calculator, does everybody have %$* 44
located this, it should be on the side of your %$* 44
arm-rest, so, see if you can find these %$* 44
all right, everybody have ‘em? %$* 44
so before we hear the arguments from our panelists, let’s see how you feel on the question right now. %$* 44
so pick up the keypad %$* 44
and after my prompt, you will press 1 if you are for the motion, “better more surveillance than another 9/11,” press 2 if you are against that motion, and press 3 if you’re undecided. %$* 44
and you may begin voting now. %$* 44
everybody got that, 1 if you’re for, 2 against, and 3 undecided. %$* 44
and i don’t see any panic from the control room so we’re hoping that %$* 44
it—it’s going to work. %$* 44
let me introduce our distinguished panel of guests tonight. %$* 44
for the motion, on my far right, spatially speaking, only, author %$* 44
columnist for national review online and resident fellow at the american enterprise institute, david frum. %$* 44
thank you. %$* 46
senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies, and contributor to national review online, former federal prosecutor andrew c.mccarthy. %$* 44
and to my immediate right, professor of law at the university of california at berkeley school of law, and former deputy assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel of the us department of justice during 9/11, john yoo. %$* 44
on my left, an unusual position for him, sometimes, former congressman, occupant of the 21st century liberties chair for freedom and privacy at the american conservative union, columnist and radio show host, the honorable bob barr. %$* 44
to mr. %$* 44
barr’s left, author, professor of law at the george washington university law school, and legal affairs editor of the new republic magazine, jeffrey rosen. %$* 44
and on my far left, professor of law at new york law school, and president of the american civil liberties union, nadine strossen. %$* 44
so let’s start the debate and arguing for the opposition, david frum, please take the podium— %$* 44
thank you. %$* 46
thank you, thank you all, and thank you to the rosenkranz foundation for their important work in %$* 46
making civil conversation really a reality in which we can all participate. %$* 46
like to tell you a little story to begin. %$* 46
uh, about two months after i started work at the white house in two—2001, there was a rap on the door, not a midnight rap, a daytime rap. %$* 46
uh, my wife, um, went to answer the door, um, and there on the step was an agent of the fbi.uh, showed her his badge, and asked if he might come in and ask a few questions. %$* 46
our neigh—next-door neighbor, he told her, had just, uh, been hired into a sensitive position in the federal government, and as part of the security check on the next-door neighbor he wanted to ask a few questions. %$* 46
so he asked my wife, uh, had we noticed anything unusual about them, did they seem to be living within their means, uh, did they, uh, conduct themselves responsibly and respectably in the neighborhood and— she was a little embarrassed because these were new neighbors, we did not know them well but to the best of her ability she gave ‘em a clean bill of health. %$* 46
but jogged by this, she said, you know, we haven’t had them over, we really should. %$* 46
so— so she invited the next-door neighbors over a few weeks later and they came and we poured tea and gave them cake and eventually my wife congratulated, um, them on, on the husband’s new job with the federal government. %$* 46
he said, what are you talking about, he said i’m—i’m still at sibley and austin, i’ve always been at sibley and austin. %$* 46
and what we realized, was, that the fbi had meant to come to their house %$* 46
to ask them about me. %$* 46
tonight’s motion, is “better—better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11,” and the question is, more than what? %$* 46
and my answer is, more than that. %$* 46
now, none of us are here to argue, none of us are here to argue for limitless domestic surveillance. %$* 46
um, the three of us on the affirmative side of this debate have a deep and abiding commitment to privacy and liberty. %$* 46
um, my colleague, andy mccarthy, has been a federal prosecutor, his job is to defend and uphold the us constitution, the greatest liberty-affirming document in world history. %$* 46
my colleague john yoo, was on the front line to defend all—all of our liberties, and liberties of people all over the world, against, uh, totalitarian conspiracy. %$* 46
not only that but in our private lives, andy mccarthy is a conservative in new york, and john yoo is a conservative at berkeley, california. %$* 46
we understand, believe me, in the most intimate possible way, the importance of free thought, free expression, privacy, and the ability of human beings to speak their mind in debate and conversation, without fear of punishment or consequence or an overbearing state. %$* 46
but %$* 46
here’s the question for today. %$* 46
should we have more surveillance than we had when those fbi agents were knocking on the wrong door %$* 46
at, uh, a level of surveillance that made possible the tremendous catastrophe we know as 9/11, or should we continue with the path we’ve been following since 9/11, toward, not a police state, not a nightmare regime in which you have no privacy. %$* 46
is anyone in this room as a concrete matter afraid to speak his or her mind? %$* 46
i very much doubt it. %$* 46
but, um %$* 46
that’s just because your listeners are so cranky. %$* 46
we, we are here— uh, we are here to uphold %$* 46
a new level of surveillance, that is, uh, that is not made up of new techniques, it is made up of very familiar and traditional techniques, as my partners will argue, that is not onerous, that is not burdensome, that leaves all legitimate freedoms and privacies intact, and that is abundantly worth it, and in fact has proven over the past half- decade, has proven in the acid test of experience its merit. %$* 46
you know, 9/11 is beginning to be a little while ago. %$* 46
but the recent terrible events of—at virginia tech, um, technical institute—the, the virginia tech university, remind us, remind us of the reality of danger and fear, uh, of—that we all experienced in those terrible days. %$* 46
now if we cast our minds back, back to that time, i think many of us will remember, we expected more of the same. %$* 46
we dreaded more of the same. %$* 46
and that was one of the reasons that, uh, the—the sniper attacks in washington were able to paralyze a great city. %$* 46
because we were ready for something dreadful, something even more dreadful. %$* 46
and on american soil, it has not happened. %$* 46
but that does not mean that the threat is not real, in fact, if you sound the roll of world events since 9/11, you will be reminded how very, very real it is. %$* 46
in december of 2001, gunmen attacked the indian parliament, and, uh, attempted— well, hoped, hoped to kill in fact very senior officials in the indian government. %$* 46
they did kill a number of parliamentarians and some ci—uh, civil servants, and some security guards, and very nearly succeeded in triggering a nuclear war, between india and pakistan. %$* 46
we remember the bombing in bali, uh, whi—which took so many lives of, uh, indonesians and australians, and others who were, who were visiting that, that beautiful place. %$* 46
the madrid atocha railway station bombings. %$* 46
the bombings in london in 2005.just this past year in 2006, attempted bombings, very serious attempted bombings, in toronto, and in germany, and tragically a successful bombing in bombay, successful of course from the point of view of the terrorists. %$* 46
these—the, the threat, the threat of mass-casualty terrorism, um, at the hands of people guided by a totalitarian ideology, remains a real threat. %$* 46
but here’s the good news. %$* 46
what we notice as we look back on this half-decade of terrible atrocities, is a dwindling level of sophistication, behind each of these attacks. %$* 46
uh, that the atocha attack was much less sophisticated than the 9/11 attack, the london attack in 2005, less sophisticated than atocha, and the attacks attempted this past summer were less sophisticated than those of 2005.the terrorists are finding it harder to coordinate, they’re finding it harder to communicate with each other, they are under crushing international pressure. %$* 46
now %$* 46
one of the ironies about this is, we don’t %$* 46
entirely understand how this is happening, even inside our own law enforcement agencies. %$* 46
here’s one way to think about how a terrorist attack proceeds. %$* 46
if any—if any of you have been in a toy store recently i’m sure you’ve seen those toys, where you drop a ball bearing, uh, through, uh, into a little slot and it whizzes and rolls and it catches the little teeter-totter and it goes through a basketball hoop, and it proceeds over many, uh, feet of track until finally it emerges out the other end. %$* 46
and there are a series all along the way of little switching points, and that’s the game, to watch the ball jump and hop and skip and move past these various obstacles. %$* 46
think of a terrorist plot as like that ball bearing. %$* 46
it starts, and it rolls and it unfurls. %$* 46
and it has to pass— %$* 46
—pass through a number of switching points. %$* 46
if you can make each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot in just the way the earth’s atmosphere stops the meteorites, without any of us ever being aware of it. %$* 46
it is that level of in—of in—of intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has complicated the life of the terrorist, not—and has not made terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to do people harm, but that has made—that has broken up their ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the united states. %$* 46
you know, all of us here, are people—are, um, are people who love liberty. %$* 46
who prize liberty, and who use liberty, as we are using it tonight. %$* 46
but we are also citizens of great cities in the western world. %$* 46
and we are all potential casualties of attack. %$* 46
and the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us. %$* 46
we are here— %$* 46
—to defend that liberty, by defending the higher level of surveillance seen since 9/11. thank you— %$* 46
one. %$* 44
—pass through a number of switching points. %$* 46
if you can make each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot in just the way the earth’s atmosphere stops the meteorites, without any of us ever being aware of it. %$* 46
it is that level of in—of in—of intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has complicated the life of the terrorist, not—and has not made terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to do people harm, but that has made—that has broken up their ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the united states. %$* 46
you know, all of us here, are people—are, um, are people who love liberty. %$* 46
who prize liberty, and who use liberty, as we are using it tonight. %$* 46
but we are also citizens of great cities in the western world. %$* 46
and we are all potential casualties of attack. %$* 46
and the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us. %$* 46
david frum— %$* 44
we are here— %$* 46
—thank you very much— %$* 44
—to defend that liberty, by defending the higher level of surveillance seen since 9/11. thank you— %$* 46
thank you, david. %$* 44
and arguing against the motion, bob barr. %$* 44
i promise %$* 47
not to use the example that david gave us, of how easy it is for the fbi to screw up something as simple %$* 47
as interviewing the right person for a federal job, security clearance %$* 47
as, as clear an example of why we should not entrust yet additional secret surveillance powers to the government, i promise not to make such an example. %$* 47
better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11? %$* 47
i don’t know how to put it quite delicately enough, and not just no but hell no. %$* 47
the government doesn’t need it %$* 47
the government has shown it doesn’t deserve it. %$* 47
the government has not justified it, the government will abuse additional domestic surveillance power, as sure as we are sitting here this evening. %$* 47
and the people of this great land, and those who lawfully visit this country as well, cannot afford it. %$* 47
now why can’t we afford it. %$* 47
many of us here, many of you all may be here this evening, because you have a particular privacy concern. %$* 47
a particular category of information, that you believe ought to be, or, continue to be, private, from government snooping. %$* 47
from government surveillance. %$* 47
or, you may not have a particular category of such information yourself, but others might, and you support them, in maintaining the secrecy, the privacy, the privilege, of maintaining that information for themselves. %$* 47
but i suspect that deep down, at least most of us are here this evening, because we understand that privacy is more than simply the sum total of individual aspects of information that we wanna retain private. %$* 47
ayn rand, that great philosopher, who just two years ago i believe it was we celebrated centennial of her birth %$* 47
and that great proponent of freedom, put it perhaps best, when she wrote, in 1943, in the middle of world war ii, in the fountainhead, that “privacy is the essence of civilization itself. %$* 47
yes, it is that important. %$* 47
civilization is the march of mankind %$* 47
toward a realization and an acceptance of and a protection of, the basic right to privacy.” i think our founding fathers understood that, when they crafted the bill of rights. %$* 47
they didn’t feel the need to mention, in each one of those, this is a privacy right. %$* 47
but just look at them, and you see the importance of privacy, embodied in %$* 47
the foundation of the first amendment. %$* 47
were it not based on a notion that we have a right to the privacy, of our religious, political views for example, there’d be no reason to have the first amendment. %$* 47
the second amendment %$* 47
so much in the news these days, also is founded in essence on the notion of privacy. %$* 47
if we, as preachers of god, did not enjoy the inherent right to the privacy of our being, of our property, then there would be no reason to have a second amendment which is designed to implement the protection of those ideas, those properties, those persons. %$* 47
the right to the privacy, the right to have your ideas, your privacy, your property, your person free from unwarranted government intrusion is indeed the essence of civilization. %$* 47
that’s why it’s so important that we address this issue. %$* 47
the question, “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” %$* 47
look at what we’re talking about here, we’re not talking about the legitimate function of government in a national security context %$* 47
to gather intelligence on foreigners, foreign intelligence. %$* 47
what we’re talking about is our government surveilling us. %$* 47
and they ought to be held, and the fourth amendment requires them to be held, to a very high burden. %$* 47
why? %$* 47
because our founding fathers recognized %$* 47
that if we allowed the government to intrude into our lives, other than in those areas where it has an articulable, legitimate need to pierce that sphere of privacy that surrounds each one of us, if we allow that, then we are not free. %$* 47
think back. %$* 47
this question also talks about another 9/11.fear, of course the driving force for virtually every effort by the federal government and indeed by state and local governments, since 9/11, to justify whatever expanded government power it is that they seek. %$* 47
we’re talking about another 9/11. well, let’s think about 9/11. did 9/11 happen, did those awful %$* 47
terrorists succeed on 9/11 in this very city, and in our nation’s capital, and in that field in pennsylvania, did they succeed because the government was not able to increase its surveillance of %$* 47
those of us in this country, no. %$* 47
those terrorists succeeded because of a series of tragic %$* 47
mistakes and blunders by government. %$* 47
our government didn’t use the tools that were already available to it. %$* 47
it could’ve stopped those terrorists at any number of points along their horrible journey. %$* 47
there were laws, repetitive laws, on the books, at the federal and the state level, to have stopped them from gaining access to the information that they needed. %$* 47
from gaining access to—access to the tools whereby car—they carried out %$* 47
their horrible deeds. %$* 47
it wasn’t because the government lacked %$* 47
sufficient power to surveil americans. %$* 47
it is a false premise. %$* 47
and what has the government done since then, and what is it even doing now. %$* 47
i guarantee you, if this question, “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11,” is answered by the american people, not just here this evening, but writ large %$* 47
then you will never, ever see the end of government surveillance power. %$* 47
sort of like being a divorce lawyer, something i do not do. %$* 47
no matter how much you concede to the other side— %$* 47
—they always want more. %$* 47
so it is with domestic surveillance. %$* 47
even today, this administration, which has violated the laws limiting %$* 47
its ability to conduct domestic surveillance, it wishes and is seeking legislation to gain even more access to our private lives, and, get this. %$* 47
the final irony. %$* 47
to grant immunity for past violations of the law. %$* 47
better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11, not on your life. %$* 47
thank you. %$* 47
one. %$* 44
—they always want more. %$* 47
one. %$* 44
so it is with domestic surveillance. %$* 47
even today, this administration, which has violated the laws limiting %$* 47
its ability to conduct domestic surveillance, it wishes and is seeking legislation to gain even more access to our private lives, and, get this. %$* 47
the final irony. %$* 47
to grant immunity for past violations of the law. %$* 47
better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11, not on your life. %$* 47
thank you. %$* 47
bob barr, thank you. %$* 44
for the motion, andrew mccarthy. %$* 44
thank you very much. %$* 48
um, pleasure to be here this evening. %$* 48
my, uh, fbi story is a little bit different from david’s. %$* 48
it’s more along the lines of what the fbi was up against. %$* 48
my brother, who lived in the bronx, was applying for a job with the fbi, uh, and the knock we got on the door was from one of the neighbors who told him that the feds had been by, but not to worry – he didn’t tell ‘em nothing. %$* 48
um, that, of course, was back in the 1990s, uh, before there ever was a, uh, george w.bush administration to bash. %$* 48
uh, and during that time the united states managed to stop exactly one terrorist attack by something other than dumb luck. %$* 48
that was the spring 1993 jihadist conspiracy against new york city landmarks, right here in manhattan. %$* 48
how did we stop it? %$* 48
the fbi had a confidential informant who infiltrated the conspiracy. %$* 48
now, think for a moment about how intrusive that is. %$* 48
our government sent a man right out into radical mosques to meet with worshipers. %$* 48
all of them were muslims. %$* 48
several of them were american citizens. %$* 48
he prayed among them, he entered their very homes, he tape recorded all of his conversations. %$* 48
and following the government’s instructions, he lied to them about who he was and who he was working for. %$* 48
and he did that precisely to trick them, uh, in order to get them to compromise their most deeply held secrets and plans. %$* 48
and you know what? %$* 48
neither the fifth amendment nor the fourth amendment had a thing to say about it. %$* 48
it’s been the law of the united states for decades that such investigative techniques do not implicate our privacy and due process interests. %$* 48
um, as a result of that there were no court orders for those tactics, no judicial supervision, uh, no supervision of any kind for the most intrusive tactics imaginable. %$* 48
and had those tactics not been used, thousands of new yorkers would have lost their lives in those attacks. %$* 48
that’s not me conjuring up a nightmare scenario. %$* 48
that’s not me trying to tap into your fear. %$* 48
that’s a case that actually happened, right down here in manhattan. %$* 48
uh, it’s the kind of investigating that didn’t happen before 9/11, when nearly three thousand people were killed, and didn’t happen in connection with most of the completed atrocities that were the subjects of the trials that took place in the 1990s. %$* 48
and the executive branch, without judicial supervision and without much congressional oversight to speak of, has intercepted and electronically eavesdropped on enemy communications in every war in the history of the united states since it’s been technologically possible to do so. %$* 48
it’s a simple fact. %$* 48
you cannot get good actionable intelligence, the intelligence that saves lives, without monitoring what people are saying to each other and without watching the bad guys to see who they speak to so that you can map out these organizations. %$* 48
that’s just common sense. %$* 48
the most dangerous conspirators are generally speaking the most insulated conspirators. %$* 48
it takes wiretapping to ferret them out. %$* 48
in the 1930s, uh, the government got al capone on tax evasion. %$* 48
that’s all they could come up with. %$* 48
uh, but in the 1990s the government got john gotti on about twenty-five homicides. %$* 48
how did they do it? %$* 48
they listened to what he was saying. %$* 48
they bugged his conversations. %$* 48
today, of course, we’re not talking about mafia hits. %$* 48
we’re talking about mass murders of our citizens – not just law enforcement but national security. %$* 48
all of our liberties are precious. %$* 48
on that, uh, i think every panelist here is in agreement, as david said before. %$* 48
but none of our liberties is worthy of the name unless we can secure the country. %$* 48
and all our liberties are valuable but none of them is as valuable as the collective right to life that belongs to all of us collectively together in our national community. %$* 48
to protect that right we have to do surveillance. %$* 48
we’re fighting an enemy that does not have a territory to defend. %$* 48
it does not have a treasure that we can destroy them by taking. %$* 48
our only, only defense is surveillance – finding out who they are, trying to figure out what they might strike next. %$* 48
and stopping them is far more important than prosecuting them. %$* 48
prosecutions become cold comfort when the death tolls start to climb into the hundreds and the thousands. %$* 48
and we’ve seen that. %$* 48
that’s not a scare tactic. %$* 48
against such daunting risks privacy interests fretted over by our friends on the other side are frankly trifles. %$* 48
what difference does it make if the government has information that your phone company, your bank and every private, uh, vendor that you deal with, uh, not only has but is warehousing and data mining, targeting you. %$* 48
uh, but unlike the government, not targeting you so that they can protect you. %$* 48
the government’s ability to access such information may make the difference between life and death. %$* 48
and in the national security context, that access is now subject to various judicial hurdles and congressional oversight, which our law has never imposed on prosecutors and agents who investigate such insignificant, relatively speaking, crimes as gambling. %$* 48
common sense tells us that under the current threat this is the kind of investigating that government not only should be able to do but must be able to do. %$* 48
if you don’t think so, ask yourself about the security you willingly subjected yourself to without any court search warrant the last time you got on a plane or entered a public building or tried to carry a bag into yankee stadium or even if you’ve had the experience of entering the offices of the american civil liberties union. %$* 48
we had a trial here in new york about a year ago and it came out during the trial that visitors to the aclu’s new york office, uh, are confronted when they come in with big signs on the wall that say, “your bags are subject to search.” why do they do that? %$* 48
it’s a reasonable balancing of our minor, of minor intrusions to protect ourselves and the people we care about. %$* 48
that’s what the fourth amendment has always been about – reasonableness. %$* 48
if there’s a valid basis to believe people could be drinking and driving the police can set up sobriety checks and stop motorists randomly. %$* 48
when the police arrest somebody, they’ve always had the ability, uh, to search them to make sure that they’re not armed. %$* 48
if you work in a regulated industry the government can compel you to provide information and even do spot checks. %$* 48
none of this requires a judicial warrant, none of it requires probable cause and there are thousands of searches like this, countless searches, taking place in this country every day, uh, and this has been the case for years and years without any discernable, uh, suggestion that the constitution has been shredded or that our core freedoms have been jeopardized. %$* 48
the thing all the exceptions i’m talking about have in common, besides being reasonable restraints on our freedom, is that none of them is nearly as important as protecting our national security – the safety of us all collectively. %$* 48
we’ve done a lot of talking about civil liberties these last six years. %$* 48
but the conversations i remember the best, uh, are the ones that i had with, uh, victims of terrorist attacks, like the world trade center attack or, uh, the two hundred, uh, mostly muslim kenyans and, and the people in the surrounding area, uh, who were, uh, victimized by the bombing of the u.s.embassy in 1998 in nairobi. %$* 48
the threat we’re facing is not hype. %$* 48
it’s, it’s flesh and blood real. %$* 48
and the fundamental rights of these victims – the vi %$* 48
the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to pursue happiness – have been stolen from them by our enemies in a way that can never be compensated. %$* 48
those are our most essential civil liberties and the only way we can protect them is by enduring comparative trifles in order to let the government do the thing that we needed to do, the only thing we really needed to do – uh, which is protect us and save lives. %$* 48
and that’s why you should vote for the motion. %$* 48
one. %$* 44
but the conversations i remember the best, uh, are the ones that i had with, uh, victims of terrorist attacks, like the world trade center attack or, uh, the two hundred, uh, mostly muslim kenyans and, and the people in the surrounding area, uh, who were, uh, victimized by the bombing of the u.s.embassy in 1998 in nairobi. %$* 48

and that’s why you should vote for the motion. %$* 48
andrew mccarthy, thank you very much. %$* 44
against the motion, jeffrey rosen – to the podium, please. %$* 44
don’t worry, i’ve got a clock here. %$* 44
no, no, i’m, i, i want my own. %$* 49
that ominous one is an orwellian, uh, and appropriate note for the evening. %$* 49
congressman barr has argued eloquently that more domestic surveillance of american citizens would not have prevented 9/11.i’d like to offer two additional reasons to try to persuade you to argue against the motion, “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.” uh, the first has to do with effectiveness. %$* 49
it’s possible to protect privacy and security at the same time. %$* 49
possible, in other words, to reduce the risk of terrorism without dramatically increasing the surveillance of american citizens. %$* 49
and the second has to do with abuse. %$* 49
uh, mr. %$* 49
mccarthy talked about the comparative trifles, the minor incursions on privacy that were necessary since 9/11 to protect us. %$* 49
but in fact, history shows that every time the government has asked for and been granted broader powers of surveillance it has not directed those expanded powers against suspected terrorists but instead has used them to conduct dragnets – ineffective dragnets – that have menaced the privacy of innocent citizens without making us safer. %$* 49
what do i mean when i say that it’s possible to protect privacy and security at the same time? %$* 49
i have in mind the evolution of a surveillance technology that, uh, some of you may have read about – and we can call this the naked machine, because this is more or less what it is. %$* 49
this is the high tech, three dimensional millimeter imaging machine that was initially used at a florida airport a couple of years ago to, uh, detect contraband. %$* 49
it can identify not only metal, uh, but anything that’s buried under clothing, ceramics or plastic. %$* 49
this is a very effective, uh, x-ray machine. %$* 49
the only downside is that it shows us completely stark naked. %$* 49
now, the people who designed this machine came up with a simple programming shift. %$* 49
they found that it’s able to maintain the pictures of the ceramics or the plastics and the contraband, but to take the pictures of the naked body and scramble it, uh, scramble the anatomically sensitive regions into a nondescript blob. %$* 49
now, obviously, this wonderful alternative – the blob machine as opposed to the naked machine – is, for many of us, an act of mercy, uh – especi %$* 49
especially for those of you this evening who are intellidating. %$* 49
you can in %$* 49
invite each afterward to co %$* 49
come by and check out the blob machine – much safer than, uh, the naked machine. %$* 49
uh, and it’s also a silver bullet technology. %$* 49
it provides just as much security without any threat to privacy. %$* 49
it shows, in fact, that it’s possible to, uh, protect our security without any, as it were, domestic surveillance. %$* 49
now, i’m convinced that all of the laws and technologies that have been proposed since 9/11 can be designed in ways that look more like the blob machine than the naked machine. %$* 49
and it’s, uh, surely willfulness that has led the other side to resist these well- designed laws and technologies, uh, for badly designed ones that menace privacy without making us safer. %$* 49
let me try to, uh, persuade you by giving an example of the evolution of one of the most controversial and important surveillance programs since 9/11.this is the program that was originally known as total information awareness. %$* 49
in its original incarnation the government proposed to unite a lot of information that’s held by public and private data bases – uh, magazine subscriptions, consumer records, internet browsing – to unite that with public arrest records and then to conduct vast data mining that would try to predict whose travel patterns resemble those of the nineteen, uh, 9/11 terrorists and to stop those people at airports. %$* 49
now, what was wrong with this system? %$* 49
it wouldn’t have worked and it posed grave threats to privacy. %$* 49
but aside from that, mrs. %$* 49
lincoln, it was an excellent system. %$* 49
why would it have been ineffective? %$* 49
well, if you imagine that the next attack looks nothing like the last one. %$* 49
it, it takes place, god forbid, on a train rather a plane – then modeling the travel patterns of the 9/11 people will lead to the arrest of a lot of retired businessmen in florida who take flying lessons but will miss all the real terrorists. %$* 49
and given the huge numbers of false positives, the nation’s airports would be brought to a halt. %$* 49
the second problem is privacy. %$* 49
the comparative trifles that mr. %$* 49
mccarthy so sneeringly dismissed would have allowed the government to store in a centralized data base all sorts of, uh, records that it could then use to menace its enemies, just as the nixon administration did when it went after the tax returns of vietnam protesters and threatened them with prosecution. %$* 49
now, the evolution of total information awareness is a positive story and one that, uh, very much supports our side because, uh, because of the opposition of a bipartisan coalition of libertarian conservatives like congressman barr and civil libertarian liberals like professor strossen. %$* 49
the system was refined. %$* 49
first, the government was prohibited from sharing information with law enforcement agents unless there was evidence of a serious crime or a violent terrorist act, avoiding that kind of discriminatory menacing of political enemies. %$* 49
and second, the government abandoned the foolish idea of trying to predict future attacks based on the patterns of past ones and instead merely confirmed that people are who they say they are at the airports – a more modest goal, the one that makes us safer. %$* 49
what initially began as a naked machine technology evolved into a blob machine one and across the range of laws and technologies we can tell a similar story. %$* 49
so the tradeoff that the other side falsely presents you with need not exist. %$* 49
now, what about the abuse? %$* 49
uh, it’s clear that every time the government has been granted new authorities it’s abused them – not to, uh, focus on suspected terrorists but instead to menace innocent citizens. %$* 49
and this is not a surprise because the essence of the patriot act, which was not a minor change in american surveillance laws, uh, but a significant one in several respects. %$* 49
the government used to only be able to engage in warrantless searches in secret without notifying the people whose data was being searched if they could prove in advance that the target was a suspected spy or foreign terrorist. %$* 49
but because of the changes in the patriot act the government is now able to engage in secret warrantless surveillance of anyone’s data merely by asserting that the data is relevant to a terrorism investigation. %$* 49
should we be surprised when the fbi, uh, using this new authority issued not a couple of carefully chosen national security letters but, according to the inspector general’s recent report, a hundred and forty thousand national security letters in the past three years? %$* 49
and according to his report’s most of those letters were not for suspected terrorists but for people who had nothing to do with terrorism. %$* 49
and should we be surprised that that data was not a trifling threat to privacy but was stored in a centralized data base and kept for twenty years? %$* 49
should we be surprised that people who visited las vegas during a false terrorist threat had their hotel records and gambling records stored in that centralized data without their knowledge because of this foolish and misguided program? %$* 49
or that the fbi, which couldn’t even get david frum’s address right, was so inept that it didn’t keep records of the national security letters that it issued and therefore didn’t know when it was getting the right or wrong data? %$* 49
how could you possibly trust the government with expanded authority when it used the authority that was given so recklessly? %$* 49
the government’s approach to this, uh, pro %$* 49
problem is much like that scene out of midsummer night’s sex comedy, where woody allen suddenly comes up to mia farrow’s window on a flying bicycle and says, hop on. %$* 49
and she’s sort of skeptical and she says, um. %$* 49
and he says, trust me. %$* 49
it’s me, andrew. %$* 49
hop on. %$* 49
she’s still skeptical. %$* 49
he says, trust me anyway. %$* 49
this – %$* 49
is the government’s approach to this problem – trust me anyway. %$* 49
and we’ve seen too much of their abuse of this power since 9/11 to continue and engage in this trust. %$* 49
so we are saying not that it’s not important to take the terrorist threat seriously but we need meaningful oversight focused on genuine terrorists, which, while protecting the privacy of innocent citizens. %$* 49
we can do that through law, we can do that know %$* 49
uh, through technology. %$* 49
we have in our hands the ability to protect privacy and security at the same time. %$* 49
what we need now is the will. %$* 49
thank you very much. %$* 49
one. %$* 44
is the government’s approach to this problem – trust me anyway. %$* 49
and we’ve seen too much of their abuse of this power since 9/11 to continue and engage in this trust. %$* 49
so we are saying not that it’s not important to take the terrorist threat seriously but we need meaningful oversight focused on genuine terrorists, which, while protecting the privacy of innocent citizens. %$* 49
we can do that through law, we can do that know %$* 49
uh, through technology. %$* 49
we have in our hands the ability to protect privacy and security at the same time. %$* 49
what we need now is the will. %$* 49
thank you very much. %$* 49
jeffrey rosen, thank you very much. %$* 44
and arguing for the motion, john yoo. %$* 44
i’d like to thank the, uh, rosenkranz foundation and intelligence squared for giving me the opportunity to escape the people’s republic of berkeley and to visit a more conservative city, like new york. %$* 50
i, uh, understand that many of you, according to the washington post, are here on dates. %$* 50
i think this is a wonderful idea. %$* 50
uh, uh, i, uh, it’s really remarkable to me cause the last date i had was in the first reagan administration. %$* 50
i do have to say, though, i find it surprising that many people would think that the voice and appearance of bob barr would be an aphrodisiac. %$* 50
first, let me, uh, directly engage with jeff’s point. %$* 50
if there are things that the government can do to increase security without reducing privacy we should have already done them. %$* 50
i think at some point, though-- %$* 50
and i think we’re at that point now – you reach a trade-off. %$* 50
it’s not unusual to security policy. %$* 50
every government decision involves a tradeoff. %$* 50
when we decide to reduce greenhouse gases by having higher mile per gallons, uh, requirements for cars, we know a certain higher number of people will die on the highways because the cars will be lighter. %$* 50
government decisions always involve tradeoffs and it’s possible to have tradeoffs that go the wrong way. %$* 50
we have had periods where civil liberties were greater than they are today and we have suffered as a result. %$* 50
so, for example, the wall that many of you may have heard about, which prohibited the fbi and the cia from pooling their information about terrorist networks is the one thing that the 9/11 commission found that directly led to the 9/11 attacks. %$* 50
because we knew the names of two of the 9/11 hijackers inside the country, the agents who worked for the intelligence bureaus were unable to communicate that information to fbi agents inside the country who could tried to locate them because of rules that were set up to protect civil liberties. %$* 50
similarly, when we have tried to put al qaeda members on trial before 9/11-- %$* 50
and mr. %$* 50
mccarthy was one of the prosecutors who did that – again, for civil liberties reasons, we turned over massive amounts of information to the defense teams. %$* 50
one of those was a list of all the co-conspirators of one of the al qaeda suspects. %$* 50
if you think about it that was a list of every single person at the time we thought was a member of al qaeda. %$* 50
that list was found in africa after the bombings in yemen, when our agents went out to try to find out who was responsible. %$* 50
i’m not saying that we should go all the way over to security or all the way for civil liberties but there is a balance. %$* 50
and there is a tradeoff. %$* 50
and having more civil liberties can have a cost of security, just as increasing security can have a reduction in civil liberties. %$* 50
also let me admit that in past wars the government has reduced civil liberties. %$* 50
but i would say, if you place it in historical perspective those reductions of civil liberties are far greater than anything we’re experiencing today. %$* 50
in 1798, the first war we fought as a country, it was made a crime to criticize the government during the war. %$* 50
in the civil war, president lincoln, on his own authority, detained thousands of american citizens in military detention without any recourse to civilian court and had many of them tried by military judges. %$* 50
in world war i it was made a crime and people were prosecuted for criticizing the war effort, for arguing that people should not obey the draft. %$* 50
in world war ii president roosevelt detained over a hundred and twenty thousand loyal american citizens. %$* 50
he initiated military courts, some of who, which were used to try american citizens. %$* 50
he ordered the warrantless wiretapping – not just of communications going in and out of the country, but every communication inside the united states – against a clear statute and supreme court precedent at the time, over a year and a half before pearl harbor. %$* 50
i think, if you compare those measures that have been taken in wartime in american history in the past, the reductions of civil liberties we have today are nowhere near as large of a magnitude. %$* 50
take, for example, the political system. %$* 50
we have had two presidential election – well, one presidential election during, uh, this post-9/11 period. %$* 50
we have had several congressional elections. %$* 50
political control of congress just switched in the last election. %$* 50
we have had outpourings of new political speech through new methods and means. %$* 50
for example, uh, people i wish never existed – bloggers. %$* 50
this did not exist before 9/11. are we really in such a serious civil liberties crisis if bloggers are able to use this new medium to say, uh, i think, quite incredible things? %$* 50
take the detention policy that i’m sure, uh, the other side is going to talk about. %$* 50
these are always slippery slope arguments. %$* 50
how many american citizens have actually been detained since 9/11 in military detention? %$* 50
it’s not the thousands or hundreds of thousands from previous wars. %$* 50
by my count, it’s two. %$* 50
how many citizens of other countries in the united states – permanent resident aliens – have been detained as part of the post-9/11 program? %$* 50
again, it’s not thousands and not hundred thousands. %$* 50
i think, again, that number is two. %$* 50
take the nsa surveillance program that we’ve all heard about. %$* 50
again, this is a program that every president in war has used-- %$* 50
sometimes without judicial supervision, often without congressional authorization, often without the knowledge of anybody – in order to gain information on pending attacks. %$* 50
so when you try to take into account these factors – the gains of security, which i think we’ve had and a loss of civil liberties – how should you think about this problem? %$* 50
let me make – just close by making just a few points. %$* 50
first, have the expanses %$* 50
expansions in government power been worth it? %$* 50
i would say, yes, look at the results. %$* 50
there have been no attacks since 9/11.and it’s not because of luck. %$* 50
i think as even the 9/11 commission report, the silverman-robb report have, uh, said, as the administration and members of congress have said – these expanded surveillance powers have resulted in the capture or prevent, capture of al qaeda members inside the united states and the prevention of plots. %$* 50
since 9/11 the united states has succeeded in capturing or killing two-thirds of al qaeda’s leadership at the time of 9/11.again, that’s not just through luck. %$* 50
second point: are civil liberties being permanently reduced? %$* 50
i think many thoughtful people would say, yes, there’s a tradeoff, but i would be worried if we reduce civil liberties in wartime in a way that once the war is over civil liberties are permanently reduced. %$* 50
there is no way for me to tell you what’s going to happen once this war is over. %$* 50
but if you look at past american history wartime has not produced a significant permanent reduction in civil liberties. %$* 50
actually, if you look at the historical record, after war we usually as a society experience our greatest growth in civil liberties. %$* 50
the civil war saw the passage of the reconstruction amendments and – %$* 50
the emancipation proclamation. %$* 50
world war ii was followed by the warren court. %$* 50
the last point: complacency, i think, is the real enemy. %$* 50
even having this debate is a show, a sign of the confidence we have that our system is working. %$* 50
but we should be aware that we’re fighting a different kind of enemy, a non- nation state that conceals its activities as normal civilian communications, as normal civilian travel. %$* 50
the hard thing is how, as a society do we fight that, fight a war against an enemy who is not following the rules of war and tries to disguise itself as one of us. %$* 50
i’ll close by saying i think so far we have made a successful balance between civil liberties and security. %$* 50
we have reduced attacks and threats on the country. %$* 50
i think those gains have been worth it. %$* 50
and the question is, i think, for all of us today, is whether we would feel comfortable reducing the amount of government powers and by doing so, give up some of the security we’ve bought at such a, i think, dear price since 9/11. thank you. %$* 50
one. %$* 44
the emancipation proclamation. %$* 50
world war ii was followed by the warren court. %$* 50
the last point: complacency, i think, is the real enemy. %$* 50
even having this debate is a show, a sign of the confidence we have that our system is working. %$* 50
but we should be aware that we’re fighting a different kind of enemy, a non- nation state that conceals its activities as normal civilian communications, as normal civilian travel. %$* 50
the hard thing is how, as a society do we fight that, fight a war against an enemy who is not following the rules of war and tries to disguise itself as one of us. %$* 50
i’ll close by saying i think so far we have made a successful balance between civil liberties and security. %$* 50
we have reduced attacks and threats on the country. %$* 50
i think those gains have been worth it. %$* 50
and the question is, i think, for all of us today, is whether we would feel comfortable reducing the amount of government powers and by doing so, give up some of the security we’ve bought at such a, i think, dear price since 9/11. thank you. %$* 50
john yoo, thank you very much. %$* 44
and against the moment, nadine strossen. %$* 44
thank you very much. %$* 51
andy, uh, i hate to burst your bubble but the reason why the aclu is required to submit those who seek admittance to, uh, some kind of i.d.procedure is because we are only tenants in the building and our strenuous objections were not well received by the landlord. %$* 51
and i have to tell you, just to illustrate how, uh, counter-productive or at least unproductive these kinds of pseudo-security measures are, um, aclu lawyers were so distressed that we were subjected – you don’t have constitutional rights against a private landlord. %$* 51
they were so, uh, distressed that they were subjected to those measures that they would sign in, uh, under names such as osama bin laden and mohammed atta and had absolutely no problem. %$* 51
uh, stupid security. %$* 51
uh, bruce schneier, one of the leading security experts in the country, uh, says that what we have seen post-9/11 is security theatre, not real security. %$* 51
uh, i also feel that since we’ve had two fbi, uh, stories from, uh, david and from andy that i will tell my own fbi story – uh, namely, the former fbi special agent who is now working for the aclu as a policy counsel, who, uh, did our, uh, extremely detailed analysis of the recent report by the office of inspector general about the massive abuses and fabrications and misuses of the national security letter, uh, and the lies that have been told about this to the public and to congress. %$* 51
and, uh, this gets to the fundamental point of trust that has been raised on both sides here. %$* 51
not, i don’t mean to condemn the fbi as an institution or condemn particular individuals. %$* 51
i’m talking about human nature and political nature and official nature – the reasons why our founders had the genius of creating a system of checks and balances. %$* 51
and we are not saying that there should not be any monitoring or any surveillance at all. %$* 51

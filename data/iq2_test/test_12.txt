let's please give a round of applause to our chairman, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hey, bob, how are you? %$* 13
i'm good, thank you. %$* 1
as i just told the audience-- %$* 13
and the old-timers know this-- %$* 13
this is where we chat a little bit about what's in store for us. %$* 13
but we were talking beforehand, and it's interesting what you told smart technology is making us dumb me is in relation to technology and a little-- %$* 13
you know, a little dabbling you've done in your career in a thing called finance, that you had some experience on both sides of the gift of technology. %$* 13
so what's the first part of that? %$* 13
well, i have. %$* 1
so about a decade ago, i thought it would be interesting to hire some people and see if they could figure out how to beat the stock market. %$* 1
and i got a group of phds, computer scientists from mit and harvard and so forth. %$* 1
and basically, with a team of six people, we were able to look at every single trade in every one of 6,000 public companies, look at every bit of financial data that they-- %$* 1
that they produced and went public with, and were able, ultimately, to figure out a way to get-- %$* 1
pick stocks that were going to go up faster than the market or down relative to those stocks. %$* 1
and by having long and short positions, we were making fairly consistent and good returns-- %$* 1
it worked out. %$* 13
for quite a long period of time, yes. %$* 1
well, we're actually all very happy for you on that point. %$* 13
well, thank you so much. %$* 1
sure. %$* 13
but it didn't exactly work out all the time. %$* 1
and there was an occasion of a period of about three weeks when all the money that the system had made over about three or four years was lost. %$* 1
oh. %$* 13
now we feel bad for you. %$* 13
well, thank you very much. %$* 1
i appreciate that. %$* 1
and the reason for that was, in a sense, smart technology making us dumb, or at least narrower in our-- %$* 1
in our thought processes. %$* 1
smart technology is making us dumbbecause most people who run successful hedge funds, which this was, learn that-- %$* 1
to be very cautious about what's called a "crowded trade," a lot of people doing the same thing at the same time, and particularly to not use a lot of debt in a crowded trade, because if you have to get out and you're forced to sell by the firm that loaned you the money, you're really in trouble. %$* 1
everybody is rushing for the exit at the same time. %$* 1
so here you had, i mean, our group of guys. %$* 1
but it turned out that there were 15 or 20 similar groups of computer scientists at different banking firms, all doing more or less the same thing, all looking at their algorithms, all looking at their data, and none of them looking at each other. %$* 1
so they never realized that what they were doing was being in a very, very crowded trade. %$* 1
and when one person overdid it and was forced to sell, it set off a whole domino effect, and everybody, including us, lost a lot of money. %$* 1
so there it is. %$* 1
well, what we do with that? %$* 13
what do we do with it? %$* 1
we know that there's something to be said on both sides of this motion, and we should have a debate. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
thank you very much, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
and let's welcome-- %$* 13
let's welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
let's welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
okay, if there are folks who are standing who want to come sit down, why don't we take an eight-second break, and you can sprint, because otherwise you'll be waiting for the intermission, and there is none. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb all right. %$* 13
once again, because this is a radio broadcast, i want to ask for a round of applause for bob rosenkranz and to get us launched. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
a personal pocket computer wizard so small you can take it with you anywhere. %$* 13
that sure sounds familiar. %$* 13
but in fact i am quoting from an ad published in a newspaper in midland, texas, in 1975.it was advertising the sharp number 1802 calculator which boasted, in its advanced technology, it boasted the broad mathematical abilities of a slide rule. %$* 13
well, we've come a long way since then to the point where probably a lot of us don't even know what a slide rule is. %$* 13
but are we smarter now because technology has come so far and put a lot more than a slide rule into our pockets? %$* 13
or are we so dependent on this wizard that is technology to do things for us that we are losing the ability to make our own magic, mentally, socially, politically? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: smart technology is making us dumb, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against the motion, "smart technology is making us dumb.” as always, our debate goes in three rounds. %$* 13
and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, please, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome nicholas carr. %$* 13
and, nick carr, you are the author of "the glass cage: automation and us" as well as "the shallows: what the internet is doing to our brains.” that was a pulitzer prize finalist. %$* 13
in these books, nick, you are warning readers about the danger of our growing reliance on computers. %$* 13
so i am wondering do you possess a smartphone? %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb well, i resisted for a long time, but about six months ago i finally broke down and bought my first smartphone. %$* 40
and how is that relationship working out? %$* 13
we're still feeling each other out. %$* 40
ladies and gentlemen, nicholas carr. %$* 13
and, nick, who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is the acclaimed writer and thinker, andrew keen. %$* 40
ladies and gentlemen, andrew keen, please welcome him. %$* 13
andrew, you are also arguing for the motion that smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
you are an entrepreneur. %$* 13
you're executive director of futurecast salon. %$* 13
you're host of the web series, "keen on," and you've also written a lot of books including "the internet is not the answer.” however, your critics have chosen some lively language to describe you. %$* 13
they've described you as "a mastodon growling against the warm wind of change." and your wikipedia entry once briefly read, "andrew keen is an expletive, expletive." so what do you do to deserve all this hostility? %$* 13
i tell the truth. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 41
i'm guessing we're going to hear some of that tonight. %$* 13
yes. %$* 41
but we won't be hearing expletives from the other side. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, team arguing for the motion, "smart technology is making us dumb." and we have a team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
first, please welcome genevieve bell. %$* 13
genevieve bell, very, very interesting story. %$* 13
you're a vice president intel fellow and you work in intel's corporate strategy office where your job basically is to worry about the future. %$* 13
before all of this, however, you were teaching in the anthropology department at stanford, so our question is for all of the humanities and social science majors out there, how does a cultural anthropologist end up working at intel? %$* 13
well, like all good australians, i met a man in a bar. %$* 42
details to come later. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and, genevieve, who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is the lovely, talented, and charming david weinberger. %$* 42
ladies and gentlemen, david weinberger. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb david weinberger, you're also arguing against the motion that "smart technology is making us dumb.” you're a senior researcher at harvard's berkman center for internet and society. %$* 13
you're at the shorenstein center at harvard-- %$* 13
at the kennedy school. %$* 13
you've written a bunch of books also including, "too big to know," and "the cluetrain manifesto.” you wrote that back in 1999, which was an early book looking at the internet's effect on business. %$* 13
and you came up with 95 theses. %$* 13
so have they stood up to the test of time? %$* 13
yeah, pretty well. %$* 43
the most important point that we make-- %$* 43
because it was coauthored-- %$* 43
was that the web is actually a social place, although it didn't look like it at the time. %$* 43
what we got-- %$* 43
one of the things we got very wrong was that we didn't know we would have to fight to keep the web the way it was. %$* 43
ah, so you were only a partial visionary? %$* 13
i am a very shaded if not shady-- %$* 43
i'm going to get you out of that. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome david weinberger. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and these are our teams arguing for and against this motion, "smart technology is making us dumb.” now, this is a debate, and that means there will be winners and losers. %$* 13
and the winners and losers will be determined by a vote of our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
before the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote, if you go to those keypads at your seat and take a look at just keys one, two, and three, the only ones that are live on that keypad, and if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree with this motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we will share the result of this vote at the end of the evening, when we also share the result of the second vote. %$* 13
and in between you will have heard the arguments, and judged the quality of the debates, and staked your final position-- %$* 13
whether that's different from the first is up to our debaters. %$* 13
on to smart technology is making us dumb round 1.round 1 are opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are uninterrupted. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is "smart technology is making us dumb.” and here to make his opening statement in support of the motion, please welcome to the lectern nick carr. %$* 13
he is author of "the glass cage: automation and us," and "the shallows: what the internet is doing to our brains.” ladies and gentlemen, nick carr. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 40
and thank you, john. %$* 40
we're gathered here tonight to talk about our intelligence, and about whether our smartphones, and our apps, and our social media accounts are expanding it or eroding it. %$* 40
are we more thoughtful now, thanks to our technologies, or less thoughtful? %$* 40
and i think you can approach that question from two different angles. %$* 40
and a little bit later, my colleague, andrew keen, is going to look at it from a social and cultural angle. %$* 40
how is the technology influencing our collective intelligence? %$* 40
what i'd like to do is talk about it from a very personal, individual level. %$* 40
how is the technology influencing the way our minds work? %$* 40
and now, by now i think all of us, if we're honest, know pretty well how we use our gadgets. %$* 40
we use them compulsively. %$* 40
and the research bears this out. %$* 40
the average person with a smartphone will pull out the phone and look at it about 150 times a day. %$* 40
and that breaks down to about six minutes for your every waking hour. %$* 40
the average teenager or 20-- %$* 40
early 20-something-year-old will send or receive about 4,000 text messages a month. %$* 40
and that also breaks down to about one every six minutes. %$* 40
and when you start to add up all the messages, all the notifications, all the alerts, all the pins, all the instagrams, all the google searches, and everything else, what you get is a clear picture that we have created, with this powerful digital technology, a new environment for ourselves. %$* 40
an environment of constant distraction-- %$* 40
almost perpetual interruption. %$* 40
now, that suits the purposes, suits the interests of companies like google and facebook, because they make more money the more we gobble up little bits of information. %$* 40
but what does it actually do to our brains and how our brains operate? %$* 40
to answer that question, i think we have to look at how we transform information, which is just the raw material of thinking, into actual knowledge. %$* 40
and that process hinges on the transfer of that information between two forms of memory. %$* 40
on the one hand, you have your working memory, which is essentially the contents of your consciousness at any given moment. %$* 40
what you're thinking about right now is your working memory. %$* 40
and we know-- %$* 40
what we know about working memory is it has an extremely small smart technology is making us dumb capacity. %$* 40
you can only hold about two to four pieces of information in your mind, your conscious mind, simultaneously. %$* 40
and then on the other side, you have our long-term memory, what we usually refer to as "memory.” the store of all the facts you know, the experiences you've had, the people you recognize. %$* 40
and this-- %$* 40
if working memory is very small capacity, long-term memory has a huge capacity. %$* 40
you can never actually fill it up. %$* 40
you can never get to the point where you say, "i can't remember anything anymore.” the key to building knowledge, the key to deep intelligence is being able to move incoming information from your conscious mind over into your long-term memory. %$* 40
this is a process called "memory consolidation," and it's through this consolidation that you create connections and associations between what you're experiencing now, what you're learning now, and what you already know. %$* 40
and it's those connections and associations between the information and the experiences in your mind that form the basis for true knowledge. %$* 40
that is the foundation for conceptual thinking, critical thinking, creative thinking. %$* 40
the problem, today, is that we're constantly overloading that small store of our working memory. %$* 40
and this creates a phenomenon-- %$* 40
an actual biological phenomenon called "cognitive overload.” if you think about it, if you can only hold two to four pieces of information in your conscious mind, then if you're constantly taking in new information, you have to push the existing information out very, very quickly in order to make room. %$* 40
and what we know is that consolidation, this kind of weaving together of information into knowledge, requires attentiveness. %$* 40
it's only when you attend to something in your working memory that you actually transfer it to your working memory and make it part of your knowledge. %$* 40
what we've created, in other words, is an environment that is constantly frustrating our mind's ability to create deep knowledge and to think deeply. %$* 40
now, we are right to celebrate all the great things we get from smart technologies, from the internet. %$* 40
it's great to celebrate the fact that we have access to all this information and all this conversation immediately. %$* 40
but what we too often forget is that information is not knowledge, it's not intelligence, and it's certainly not wisdom. %$* 40
and when we spend all of our time gathering information, what gets crowded out is the time to distance yourself from distractions and interruptions and think deeply about things, think deeply about the experiences you're having, think deeply about the new facts you're learning, think deeply about the conversation you're having. %$* 40
this is the kind of thinking that the internet and smart devices in general, by peppering us with messages and little bits of information all day long, is stealing from us. %$* 40
we're losing that contemplative, deep, focused, attentive state of mind that is crucial to the creation of knowledge, the creation of intelligence, and deep thinking in general. %$* 40
so even though we can smart technology is making us dumb celebrate all the great things the internet does, i think we have to be honest with ourselves. %$* 40
and i would suggest you look not only to the science and not only to what everybody on the stage is going to say, but to your own experience with the technology, how you use it, whether, when you want to think deeply, you pull out your smartphone, or you try to distance yourself from your smartphone and from your computers. %$* 40
and by thinking about your own experience, i think you'll get a clue to the broader theme of what this technology is doing to us. %$* 40
and i think, if you're honest with yourself, you'll conclude that indeed our smart technologies are making us dumb, and you'll vote for that proposition. %$* 40
thank you very much. %$* 40
thank you, nicholas carr. %$* 13
and that is the motion, "smart technology is making us dumb.” and here to argue against the motion, david weinberger, author of "too big to know: rethinking knowledge now that the facts aren't the facts, experts are everywhere, the smartest person in the room is the room.” ladies and gentlemen, david weinberger. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 43
thank you. %$* 43
thank you, nick and-- %$* 43
so if nick is right, and our technology is having this physical effect on our physical brain, keeping us from being able to form knowledge out of information, then why is this-- %$* 43
it seems to me to that this is-- %$* 43
this is the greatest time in human history to be somebody who cares about knowledge. %$* 43
this is-- %$* 43
this is a renaissance of knowledge. %$* 43
if we take the question, "is our smart tech making us dumb," i want to not even refute that. %$* 43
i want to ask, why do we keep asking that? %$* 43
because if "smart" means that we make good decisions, then we are-- %$* 43
new predictive technologies, very smart-- %$* 43
enable us to do that. %$* 43
if being smart means understanding more, we now have from the higgs boson to the hubble telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old. %$* 43
and if "smart" means better at our work, then i absolutely, and you absolutely, want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is. %$* 43
so why do we have ask? %$* 43
i think in part it's because of the shock of the new. %$* 43
and this is very, very new, what's going on. %$* 43
andy clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumbwe think with things in the world, out in the world. %$* 43
so a mathematician thinks with chalk on a blackboard. %$* 43
an architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something. %$* 43
and a meteorologist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data put to use to predict the weather down to the hour. %$* 43
that's really, really smart. %$* 43
and it's our smart technology that lets us do that. %$* 43
if clark is right, and i think he is, that we think of objects out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we think changes radically, which is why i think we even consider the possibility that our smart tech is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the important ways than ever. %$* 43
another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good. %$* 43
but that's not the case. %$* 43
we didn't invent gatekeepers because we said-- %$* 43
in the old world, in a prior world-- %$* 43
we didn't invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, "you know what would be really swell? %$* 43
let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide what makes it through those gates.” we invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that technology of paper, was so limited. %$* 43
it had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow. %$* 43
and so we needed to have gatekeepers. %$* 43
but now we don't. %$* 43
now the gates are down. %$* 43
we have this huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that. %$* 43
and sometimes it's disconcerting. %$* 43
one of the main strategies is that we skim. %$* 43
we skim a lot. %$* 43
that's actually a really adaptive technology-- %$* 43
technique for dealing with it. %$* 43
and it's not even an old technique. %$* 43
it's a technique that we use when we go into an old-fashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles, and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested-- %$* 43
and that-- %$* 43
so we still do that now. %$* 43
we're doing it online. %$* 43
and just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are able to drill down into it. %$* 43
we start reading it. %$* 43
it's-- %$* 43
in this age of constant distraction, we can't focus, we're watching seven years of "game of thrones," the most complex narrative that we've ever seen in our world. %$* 43
and i'll see you sunday night. %$* 43
it's great. %$* 43
we love this stuff. %$* 43
our children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization. %$* 43
our universities are turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics, deeper than ever because they can go that deep because of the internet. %$* 43
so i don't think the evidence is there, despite the brain chemistry, that we are in fact not knowing. %$* 43
we are knowing more and better than ever. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumbif you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd find something, you'd read an article. %$* 43
it was really exciting, you wanted to know more. %$* 43
you want-- %$* 43
but you can't because it's 1980.and all you've got was that rectangle of print. %$* 43
that's what it was like before we had smart technology. %$* 43
you were just stuck. %$* 43
it's infuriating even to think about at this point. %$* 43
that's not right. %$* 43
it's certainly not natural. %$* 43
so let me give you an example: 1911, with the-- %$* 43
sorry, britannica, encyclopedia britannica had its first article on oliver goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words long. %$* 43
each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff. %$* 43
by 1994, it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's-- %$* 43
the editors of the britannica, the gatekeepers of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what britannica knows about goldsmith, because that's how paper works. %$* 43
wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got to count all of the-- %$* 43
look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for goldsmith. %$* 43
you can do the apples to apples. %$* 43
it's-- %$* 43
and there will be much more. %$* 43
and people will disagree about what-- %$* 43
which of those links count, which is fine, because in wikipedia and on the web overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles. %$* 43
they assume a much more natural shape, which is that of a web, which is-- %$* 43
has near infinite capacity. %$* 43
it enables us to accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger than any one brain could ever have made. %$* 43
and we get to see how the knowledge is made, which is in many ways very disconcerting. %$* 43
we see that it's human. %$* 43
it's a human product. %$* 43
it's full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong, they're getting things right. %$* 43
that's how knowledge is made. %$* 43
that's how knowledge was always made. %$* 43
but now we can see it. %$* 43
it's in our face. %$* 43
and that's a truth. %$* 43
that's a truth about knowledge that was always true of knowledge. %$* 43
but now that we can see it, we're beginning-- %$* 43
it's an amazing thing. %$* 43
we're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge. %$* 43
this has-- %$* 43
we've never been in a period like this before. %$* 43
but it may-- %$* 43
it's upsetting because now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans. %$* 43
so it seems clear to me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of history; in this case, it's to be on the wrong side of evolution. %$* 43
so i urge you to vote against the proposition and to do so emphatically. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 43
it's on right now. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 43
thank you, david weinberger. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is, "smart technology is making us dumb.” you have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third. %$* 13
debating for the motion that "smart technology is making us dumb.” let's welcome to the lectern andrew keen. %$* 13
he is executive director of the silicon valley salon futurecast and author of the book, "the internet is not the answer." %$* 13
well, i've often been accused of being on the wrong side of history, but i love the idea of being on the wrong side of evolution. %$* 41
if my mother was alive, she would particularly appreciate that. %$* 41
that's why i'm not married either. %$* 41
so david is clearly a passionate man, i have a great deal of respect and love for him. %$* 41
we've jousted many times before, but i've never heard him quite as effusive of our world. %$* 41
he talks about something he calls a "renaissance of knowledge.” a renaissance of knowledge, david, when was the last time you turned the internet on? %$* 41
it's on right now. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 43
when was the list time you looked at twitter? %$* 41
when was the last time you went on facebook? %$* 41
when was the last time you observed the nature of our digital culture, the very culture that nick so brilliantly tore apart in his opening remarks? %$* 41
you argue that-- %$* 41
and nick brings up this word, "distance"-- %$* 41
we're talking, of course, in this new media, the media that you describe as a "renaissance of knowledge"-- %$* 41
what nick is describing is the end of distance. %$* 41
perhaps if we were academics, we would call it, "the death of distance," the end of distance. %$* 41
so we have these devices. %$* 41
i know this is radio, but on the radio you can imagine what i'm waving. %$* 41
we have the death of distance. %$* 41
we have a culture of intimacy, of personalization. %$* 41
this is the culture of intimacy and personalization that has replaced what you described as "narrow gatekeepers.” we all become the media in this world. %$* 41
we all have our devices. %$* 41
we all have our publishing platforms. %$* 41
we can all tell the world what we're thinking, what we're doing, where we're going, what we're wearing, unfortunately sometimes what we're not wearing. %$* 41
we all have these technologies-- %$* 41
wiki, youtube, blogging technologies-- %$* 41
that allow us to express what nick called the "death of distance," the end of distance. %$* 41
it explains our contemporary cult of authenticity, this idea that we always have to be true to ourselves. %$* 41
it's, of course, a manifestation of a particularly corrupted nature of democracy, a world where everything is intimate, everything is personalized. %$* 41
nick described it in scientific terms i guess as not only the end of distance, the end of depth, and the end of objectivity. %$* 41
everything, then, in this media, in this world of smart technology is personalized. %$* 41
everything is intimate. %$* 41
everything is telling the world what we think. %$* 41
everything is confirming what we already think. %$* 41
so this so- called smart technology-- %$* 41
i don't know where we get this term. %$* 41
the person who came up with the term, "smart technology," should be spanked, at least metaphorically, because i don't know where the word came from. %$* 41
there's nothing smart about personalized, intimate technology. %$* 41
it simply confirms our misplaced ideal that the world revolves around us. %$* 41
it's a pre-copernican notion. %$* 41
and ironically it's technology confirming that. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumb technology by definition, as i'm sure some frankfurt theorist like walter benjamin once argued, technology is by definition romantic and nostalgic and reactionary. %$* 41
so don't accuse nick and i of being that. %$* 41
we are the progressives. %$* 41
we are the ones looking forward. %$* 41
it's technologists, or people with a belief in the idea of technology as salvation who are reactionaries, they-- %$* 41
they're the ones who want to drive us back, like rousseau, to some idealized community. %$* 41
so what do we have? %$* 41
we have then a technology of intimacy, which is resulting, in cultural and social terms, in a more and more personalized culture, a platform where we tell the world what we're doing, what we're thinking. %$* 41
it represents the disappearance, the death not only of distance but of communication. %$* 41
we struggle more and more to talk to one another. %$* 41
sherry turkle wrote a brilliant book called, "alone together.”this technology is indeed making us alone together. %$* 41
it's a technology not only, as nick said, of distraction, but of atomization, of alienation. %$* 41
this is durkheim on steroids. %$* 41
this is a world of profound disorientation and destruction of the community. %$* 41
so what we have, then, in epistemological terms, is the disappearance of that kind of objectivity that nick talks about. %$* 41
i think david described it-- %$* 41
he thinks this is a good thing, epistemological chaos. %$* 41
everyone saying everything at the same time, and no one listening to anyone else. %$* 41
the ultimate-- %$* 41
the ultimate consequence, of course, of this is the selfie. %$* 41
this is a selfie culture. %$* 41
this is a culture where the ultimate expression is photographing ourselves in front of a masterpiece, in front of auschwitz, in front of someone jumping off the bay bridge. %$* 41
these are true examples of selfie culture. %$* 41
meanwhile, what's going on? %$* 41
david celebrates the narrow gatekeepers that are being destroyed. %$* 41
but of course, since we have this so-called smart technology, what has happened to those gatekeepers? %$* 41
we're seeing not only the death of distance, but the death of newspapers, the death of recorded music, the death of the professional creative class, the people who made their living thinking, the people who have made their living writing books, the people who made their living writing articles for newspapers, the people who made their living taking photographs. %$* 41
that kind of smart technology is making us dumb professionalism is in crisis. %$* 41
some people even believe that the creative professional is a thing of the past. %$* 41
so, what we have is this double whammy. %$* 41
on the one hand, personalization, intimacy, driven more and more into ourselves, into an echo chamber culture, where we never listen to anything anyone else is saying, particularly if it dissonates with us. %$* 41
and on the other hand, the death of a professional culture. %$* 41
that is why you should believe that smart culture-- %$* 41
whoops-- %$* 41
smart technology-- %$* 41
that was freudian-- %$* 41
smart technology – is certainly making us dumb. %$* 41
thank you. %$* 41
thank you. %$* 13
andrew keen. %$* 13
and that is the motion: smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
and here's our final debater against the motion in this opening round. %$* 13
please welcome genevieve bell. %$* 13
she's an anthropologist, intel fellow, and vice president at intel corporation. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, genevieve bell. %$* 13
perhaps it's fitting that it falls to a woman and an australian to rebut that particular moment. %$* 42
i find myself delightfully, at the end of this conversation, thinking about the proposition, is smart technology making us dumb? %$* 42
i think it's probably ironic that we started this debate using a smart device to vote on that proposition, and that most of you in the room said you had smart technology on your persons, even though you've now disabled it for radio. %$* 42
when i was given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school-- %$* 42
which is a long time ago-- %$* 42
i was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question. %$* 42
it's an anthropological approach too, right? %$* 42
and ask "what is smart technology? %$* 42
" echoing andrew's concern of what on earth that might mean. %$* 42
what does “dumb” mean? %$* 42
is smart/dumb the only binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, i might want to ask, a bad thing? %$* 42
i mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around dumbness that are interesting. %$* 42
smart technology is now being described as romantic, smart technology is making us dumb progressive, reactionary, a rectangle, and a gatekeeper, all of which is an interesting set of a baggage to put on a phone, the internet, algorithms, the internet of things, and big data. %$* 42
nonetheless, we have done that. %$* 42
so, david said to me, "no, genevieve, don't deconstruct the argument.” so i'm taking his advice. %$* 42
i am, however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some unexpected ways. %$* 42
it's made us more responsive. %$* 42
it's made us more engaged. %$* 42
and in the case of both andrew and i, it's made us more enraged and i'm not necessarily convinced that's a bad thing. %$* 42
so, how might i go about proving that? %$* 42
well, i think there's a couple of places you'd look to. %$* 42
and many of them are outside of this room, and manhattan, and outside of the united states. %$* 42
smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer. %$* 42
if you were to look, in the last year, i can pull you examples from all over the world. %$* 42
in many african countries and on the indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out health warnings and preventative health messages. %$* 42
when the ebola outbreak was taking place, messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their communities, and the bodies that they were encountering. %$* 42
hardly dumb, right? %$* 42
in australia, where i come from, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the fire season, use a geo-located app service that sends out notifications to australians to tell them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a high-fire danger day, which isn't always obvious. %$* 42
and how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous landscape. %$* 42
in the united states, you have the amber alert, something i'm sure many of you hope to never see on your telephones. %$* 42
but when you do, you know what to do. %$* 42
it's about making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter about danger. %$* 42
and it will be hard to argue with what’s happened in nepal over the last three and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and comfort to a community that was clearly struggling. %$* 42
in all of those cases, is smart technology making us dumber? %$* 42
i hardly think so. %$* 42
and if you were to move further out from that frame and think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book learning. %$* 42
but let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge. %$* 42
i'm the child of an anthropologist. %$* 42
i grew up with indigenous people in australia. %$* 42
i spent a lot of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years as smart technology is making us dumb those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things. %$* 42
the ngadjuri with whom my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories. %$* 42
they like the fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their colonial contact and argue about how to regain their land. %$* 42
the diri and the kukuda are using iot sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state- based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better. %$* 42
and the anangu in central australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community. %$* 42
is smart tech, in those instances, making those communities dumber? %$* 42
i hardly think so. %$* 42
and is it about a vacuum and people just talking to each other? %$* 42
i don't think that's the right way to think about it, either. %$* 42
moving closer to home, at intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community, about diversity in stem education. %$* 42
and one of our challenges frequently is to convince young women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences. %$* 42
and one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before. %$* 42
finding the stories of women pioneers and under-represented minorities who were pioneers used to be difficult. %$* 42
it's nice to be in new york for me. %$* 42
i get to go visit judy chicago's dinner table at the brooklyn museum, and i think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those women's names and how much easier it is to do it today. %$* 42
my twitter feed just recently brought me the name of sharla boheim who actually was the original lead name on pocket-- %$* 42
packet simulation technology. %$* 42
you don't need to know what it is, but it's the foundation of the internet. %$* 42
and she was involved. %$* 42
until quite recently, people didn't know that. %$* 42
so is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more people into the conversation making us dumb? %$* 42
i certainly hope not, because it's something i participate in regularly. %$* 42
and almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of community and citizenship. %$* 42
andrew brought it up. %$* 42
let's take it on a little bit more seriously. %$* 42
what have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of citizenship beyond the united states and within it? %$* 42
were the students who were protesting at mong kok in hong kong say that smart technology was making them dumb? %$* 42
i don't think so. %$* 42
would-- %$* 42
and i'm never going to get this man's name right, so i apologize in advance-- %$* 42
but would feidin santana think that he was doing something dumb when he took out his camera phone and recorded a policeman shooting someone in south carolina? %$* 42
and we watched the video rocket around america and drive yet a further conversation about race and violence, and what it means to be a citizen? %$* 42
we can dismiss hashtag activism-- %$* 42
such a great phrase-- %$* 42
as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right? %$* 42
whether it's #blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #sosblackaustralia from my hometown. %$* 42
but truthfully the use of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new. %$* 42
a photograph made a huge difference in how we talked about the vietnam war. %$* 42
the radio and vinyl records, which smart technology is making us dumb are making a comeback, i'll have you know, helped distribute the word of martin luther king. %$* 42
and the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter. %$* 42
so is smart technology in those cases making us dumb? %$* 42
i don't think so. %$* 42
does it mean we still have a lot of work to do as citizens? %$* 42
absolutely. %$* 42
and lest i end on a depressing note, because i realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something else. %$* 42
smart technology is also in our everyday lives. %$* 42
and some of those things we may not think about as making us smart, but they're certainly changing, i would argue, for the better personhood. %$* 42
here's my last example: online dating, because you should end on a good note. %$* 42
when i was in india doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this technology for a long time, a woman said to me, "getting a husband is just a database problem." and she said the matrimonial time-- %$* 42
matrimonial classified section of the times of india changed everything for us because the database got bigger. %$* 42
so, let us imagine, from changing ideas of citizenship and safety, to ideas of romance to ideas of what it means to be in the world, it's really hard, i imagine, for any of us to sit in this room and to agree to the proposition that smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 42
so along with david, i think you should emphatically vote against it. %$* 42
thank you. %$* 42
thank you, genevieve bell. %$* 13
and that is our motion: smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
the motion is this: smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
we have two debaters argue strenuously for the motion. %$* 13
they have made the argument that the new technology-- %$* 13
and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- %$* 13
is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers. %$* 13
they also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb the team arguing against the motion, genevieve bell and david weinberger, argue that thanks to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before. %$* 13
they hail the fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead. %$* 13
and they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them those voices. %$* 13
so i hear-- %$* 13
we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture. %$* 13
so i think we need to take some of those in turn. %$* 13
and i want to start more with the argument that was made about the impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge. %$* 13
and it sounds to me-- %$* 13
i want to take this to david weinberger. %$* 13
you have celebrated the vast expansion of the amount of information out there. %$* 13
but i-- %$* 13
it seems to me that your opponents are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction. %$* 13
i want to see if you take that point or would refute it: %$* 13
well, on the one hand, i am not happy with the metaphorical use-- %$* 43
and yes, i am goading you, i think, nick-- %$* 43
the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom. %$* 43
this is a pyramid that was constructed that was-- %$* 43
somebody came up with, russell ackoff, i think, in the 1990s. %$* 43

right now, i’d like to introduce the, uh, chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, which is the sponsor of intelligence squared, robert rosenkranz, who will frame tonight’s debate. %$* 33
thank you, robert, and, uh, welcome back. %$* 1
uh, on my behalf and on behalf of dana wolfe our executive producer it’s a pleasure to welcome you. %$* 1
well, our debate tonight is, in our minds anyway in the context of admissions to our elite universities and graduate schools: is it time to end affirmative action? %$* 1
our topic tonight seems on the face of it ideological. %$* 1
uh, liberals feel it’s—affirmative action is needed to, uh, create opportunities for blacks and hispanics and to meet a societal need, uh, for racial diversity in the universities, and in leadership positions thereafter. %$* 1
conservatives believe that color-blindness is a bedrock constitutional principle. %$* 1
we see the issue as more nuanced. %$* 1
let me focus exclusively on what might be considered conservative ideas to— to show why. %$* 1
the conservative case against affirmative action includes these elements. %$* 1
first, affirmative action is a euphemism for admitting blacks and hispanics to selective universities, despite wide gaps in sat scores and grades. %$* 1
discriminating on the basis of race is inherently unfair and offensive, particularly when it’s done by governments. %$* 1
the beneficiaries of affirmative action are not the truly disadvantaged, they are mostly middle-class. %$* 1
the legal framework around affirmative action offers no coherent rationale, and no clear guidelines to acceptable conduct. %$* 1
so, that’s the, uh, the conservative case. %$* 1
but there’s a conservative case for affirmative action as well. %$* 1
and it’s grounded in the ideas of free association, choice, and competition. %$* 1
our elite universities compete with one another vigorously, for students, for faculty, for contributions, research funds, and most fundamentally, for the prestige and influence of producing future leaders. %$* 1
their mission is not fulfilled simply by admitting candidates with the highest grades. %$* 1
instead they routinely favor athletes, creative artists, students from poor families and unusual geographies, black and hispanic applicants, as well as children of generous alumni. %$* 1
they must recognize that overweighting these elements in their portfolio of admitted students, underweights other elements, and most obviously asian students with a predilection for the sciences. %$* 1
so either the portfolio of admitted students is optimal, or, competition with—among universities will correct it. %$* 1
politicians or courts or voters for that matter, have little useful to contribute. %$* 1
so our debate tonight is, it’s time to end affirmative action, and that goes to the merits of the matter. %$* 1
but in listening to the facts and, uh, arguments marshaled by our panelists this evening, you might wanna keep in mind the question, time for whom. %$* 1
i’m delighted to welcome back our moderator robert siegel, the long-time national public radio host of “all things considered,” robert, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 33
thank you, bob. %$* 33
thank you, bob rosenkranz, and i’d like to welcome you all to the fourth debate of the second intelligence squared us series. %$* 33
the resolution being debated tonight is, “it’s time to end affirmative action,” and let me give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 33
uh, members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument, presentations are limited to eight minutes each. %$* 33
uh, when opening arguments are complete, i’ll open the floor to questions from the audience. %$* 33
uh, after the question-and-answer session, each debater will make a final two-minute summation, and finally, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that’s attached to the armrest of your seat and i’ll announce your decision on what side carried the day after the debate, but we’ll start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 33
uh, please pick up the keypad that’s attached to the armrest on your left %$* 33
looks like this. %$* 33
uh, and for audience members who are sitting along the aisle, uh, to my right, uh, your keypad is attached to the armrest on your right side next to your neighbor’s. %$* 33
now again today’s resolution is, “it’s time, uh, to end affirmative action.” after my prompt, uh, press 1 to vote for that motion, 2 to vote against it, and 3 if you are undecided. %$* 33
you may gin voting—you may begin voting rather, now. %$* 33
good. %$* 33
and i’ll reveal the results of your pre-debate vote, uh, later in the evening. %$* 33
i’d like now to introduce, uh, the panel, and please, uh, hold your applause or any other reaction until after all six are introduced. %$* 33
uh, first arguing for the motion, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and columnist for the new york sun, john mcwhorter. %$* 33
the president of the center for individual rights, terence pell, and actor, social commentator and syndicated columnist, joseph phillips. %$* 33
uh, and against the motion are, staff attorney for the asian-american legal defense and education fund, khin mai aung, professor of law at ucla and columbia law school is kimberlé crenshaw, and writer and educator, uh, tim wise. %$* 33
i’d like to now, uh, call our debaters, uh, to rise to the podium and to give their, their opening, uh, statements, on the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action,” eight debater has eight minutes, i’ll give a one-minute warning. %$* 33
uh, first, joseph phillips for the motion. %$* 33
thanks. %$* 34
hoo, boy. %$* 34
feel like i did before my first love scene with halle berry, so, you can— imagine, if you have any imagination at all the butterflies, and actually the excitement. %$* 34
uh, because i’m here in defense of what i think is one of the, uh, cornerstones of our republic, that of non- discrimination. %$* 34
and i think it was articulated in brown vs. %$* 34
the board of education when, decided that discrimination in our public schools was unconstitutional, became part of our cultural lexicon a few years later when presidents kennedy and johnson issued an executive order, that stately clearly and unambiguously, that, affirmative action should be taken to ensure that hiring, uh, decisions were made without regard to race. %$* 34
and then of course it was given teeth in the law, uh, through the civil rights act of 1964, which was very clear, that, uh, discrimination based on race was unlawful. %$* 34
and, uh, to quote, uh %$* 34
an ‘80s sitcom, uh, it’s a different world from where ya come from. %$* 34
that was then, that was good old-fashioned non- discrimination, and it was good for america. %$* 34
well times have changed, and what we’re talking about now, affirmative action is no longer about non-discrimination, it’s about racial preferences. %$* 34
and that is what we oppose—racial preferences. %$* 34
now, that doesn’t mean that we believe that racism has suddenly disappeared. %$* 34
it hasn’t. %$* 34
we know that racism exists. %$* 34
listen. %$* 34
i’m 45 years old. %$* 34
i’ve been black in america for a long time. %$* 34
i have seen racism, i have been the victim of racism, i’m not about to stand up here and pretend, that it doesn’t exist. %$* 34
but the question before us is not, does racism exist, the question is, are racial preferences an effective means to combat racism. %$* 34
and the answer is simply no. %$* 34
there isn’t any evidence at all, that racial preferences actually benefits us in terms of our race relations, in fact, what evidence there is points to just the opposite. %$* 34
what we do know, is that racial preferences tend to, to en—enhance, and, and firm up negative stereotypes, particularly as it pertains to black intellectual capacity and academic capabilities. %$* 34
you know %$* 34
there was a saying that my mother had. %$* 34
and i hear it in my head right now. %$* 34
there is no monopoly on brain power. %$* 34
that’s what my mother said all the time, there is no monopoly on brain power, black people can compete, we can compete on the athletic field, we can compete in the symphony halls, and we can compete in the classrooms. %$* 34
and what’s more, my mother said, you can compete, and you will compete. %$* 34
but there are some folks who, sadly, are gonna tell my children something very different. %$* 34
and you don’t have to take my word for it, let’s just look at what they say. %$* 34
richard atkinson, former president of the university of california at berkeley, standing before an audience similar to this, at university of san diego, said that it was highly doubtful if not impossible that we would achieve diversity on our nation’s premiere campuses without the use of racial preferences. %$* 34
now atkinson was not standing before a curious world, telling everybody he’s just a big fat racist, and unless you rein me in i’m gonna start discriminating right and left! %$* 34
no. %$* 34
what he was saying is that there is a monopoly on brain power, and that black students don’t have it in sufficient quantity to show up in significant numbers in our nation’s campuses. %$* 34
now if you’re not sufficiently %$* 34
offended, as you should be, let’s take something else that you often hear in discussions like this. %$* 34
someone, maybe here or over here, is bound to stand up and say whoa! %$* 34
i benefited from affirmative action. %$* 34
you benefited from affirmative action, she benefited from affirmative action. %$* 34
and of course, they’re not saying, well, you benefited from non-discrimination. %$* 34
well i did and that’s a good thing. %$* 34
what they’re saying is, i couldn’t qualify, you couldn’t qualify, she couldn’t qualify %$* 34
absurd. %$* 34
miss krimberle crenshaw there. %$* 34
i’ve met her for the first time, i’ve read what she’s written, i’ve heard her on the radio, this is a smart, dynamic woman. %$* 34
the idea, that but for racial preferences, miss crenshaw would be standing on the corner singing doo wop someplace is offensive to me, and it should be offensive to all in the sound of my voice. %$* 34
now, you’re gonna hear a lotta statistics today, i’m not gonna talk to you about statistics. %$* 34
i’m gonna talk to you about people, because racial preferences impact and affect people. %$* 34
this past april, spring, my wife was at a birthday party with our, with our children. %$* 34
and %$* 34
the mothers are sitting there talking, the fathers in there, you know, that, you tend to avoid these things like the plague so i wasn’t there. %$* 34
but the mothers are grouped and they’re talking about their children, where they go to school and it comes to light, that my oldest boy attends a magnet program, uh, for highly gifted students. %$* 34
without missing a beat %$* 34
one of the other mothers says, well, you know, now, with this supreme court decision they won’t be able to accept, uh, kids in these programs for diversity. %$* 34
well, my wife was kinder than i would have been. %$* 34
after she picked her jaw up off the floor she explained to the woman, look. %$* 34
he’s not in this program because he checked some box. %$* 34
you can’t get in this program unless you score 99.9 percent on the test. %$* 34
let me repeat that—99.9 percent on the test. %$* 34
and, he’s making straight a’s. %$* 34
in this program. %$* 34
and what is more ironic, is that the woman she was talking to, is a teacher in the los angeles unified school district. %$* 34
that %$* 34
is the evil of racial preferences. %$* 34
that, is the real-life impact of racial preferences. %$* 34
teachers, who lack faith in the academic abilities of their students, and children, who no matter how hard they work, no matter how %$* 34
how broad their gifts %$* 34
are stained with preference. %$* 34
with, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, benefi—fishi—fishishence. %$* 34
that’s greek. %$* 34
and my child is not the only one, there are thousands, and thousands of students just like him, who cannot enter our nation’s college campuses boldly and confidently. %$* 34
they enter, again, dripping with the stigma of racial preferences. %$* 34
and i’m here to tell you tonight, that that is not good for america. %$* 34
thank you. %$* 34
one. %$* 33
and my child is not the only one, there are thousands, and thousands of students just like him, who cannot enter our nation’s college campuses boldly and confidently. %$* 34
they enter, again, dripping with the stigma of racial preferences. %$* 34
and i’m here to tell you tonight, that that is not good for america. %$* 34
thank you. %$* 34
thank you, uh, joseph phillips, speaking in favor of the motion. %$* 33
uh, now, to make an opening statement against the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action,” tim wise. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 35
you know, it always amazes me, to hear critics of affirmative action speak about this subject, as if racial preference were something that were invented in the ‘60s, to benefit people of color. %$* 35
because in fact whether we wish to acknowledge it or not and of course we don’t, the entire history of this country is the history of affirmative action for white folks like myself. %$* 35
and unless we begin by discussing that affirmative action, and the impact that it has had we engage in a discussion that is both ethically and practically irresponsible. %$* 35
contrary to what joseph tells you this debate is about the extent to which racism still exists because it in— is indeed the existence of that racism which necessitated affirmative action in the beginning, and continues to necessitate it today. %$* 35
whether we wish to acknowledge it or not, enslavement, indian genocide, segregation, did not only oppress people of color, they elevated white folks, and provided us with opportunities that we did not in fact earn. %$* 35
the homestead act allowed whites to claim over 270 million acres of land for virtually nothing down, at a time when folks of color could not, today there are 40 million white folks descended directly from those, who received that land giveaway, millions of them, still living on the property, they owe their lives to affirmative action. %$* 35
then there was the fha home-loan program which for the first 30 years of its existence, operated in a whites- only fashion, lending over $120 billion worth of government- backed housing equity to whites, thereby creating the white middle class. %$* 35
and in large measure because of those preferences, the typical black college couple, college-degreed couple starts out with less than one-fifth the net worth of a typical young white couple because the latter of those, has likely received the benefits of their family’s prior head start while the former, are likely to have accumulated far less having had less chance to do so. %$* 35
so against that backdrop, ending affirmative action would only further cement the systemic advantages for whites that have been in place for hundreds of years, it would be tantamount to favoring those three laps ahead in a five-lap race even though those are ahead gained their head start as the result of an unfair process, but even worse, to end affirmative action would ignore the ongoing reality, not past, but ongoing reality, of white racial preference, and not only in education, but also in employment, and let me clarify, we were not told that our remarks tonight had to focus only on higher education. %$* 35
that resolution doesn’t mention higher education, i will not speak of it only with regard to schools. %$* 35
because it is not only there that it matters. %$* 35
according to the office of federal contract compliance, three out of four companies covered by affirmative action regulations violate them regularly, and not just that, but are also in violation of basic civil rights law. %$* 35
the problem is the ofccp only has enough monitors to check up on the companies under their purview once every 46 years. %$* 35
so there’s no deterrent. %$* 35
but those who would end affirmative action never call for beefing up civil rights enforcement, indeed, though his teammates might not know it, mr. %$* 35
pell’s organization advocates abolishing anti- discrimination law altogether, as it regards the private sector, so, joseph can sing the praises of the 1964 civil rights act, but the man sitting next to him, would get rid of it as it regards private organizations, so to endorse the resolution would only intensify the problem of discrimination, those who would end affirmative action ignore the study, recent study, which found that job applicants with white-sounding names have a 50 percent greater chance of getting a call-back for an interview than those with black-sounding names even when qualifications are indistinguishable. %$* 35
they ignore, not only that, but the research which has found that eight in 10 jobs are never advertised, instead they’re filled by networking, a process that mostly excludes people of color and women of all colors and elevates whites and men not because we are better for certain jobs but because we know the right people, and if affirmative action none of that would change for the better %$* 35
if anything it would get worse, the same is true for schooling. %$* 35
our opponents will rail against so-called preferences of students of color while they ignore the preferences built in for whites. %$* 35
so they condemn the university of michigan for giving 20 points on a 150-point scale to students of color but they ignored the points that were in practice, essentially for whites only. %$* 35
like the 16 points you got, if you were from the upper peninsula of michigan. %$* 35
the snow is not the only thing white there. %$* 35
the 10 points, just because you went to a top high school which means your parents live in the right zip code. %$* 35
the eight points for taking advanced- placement classes, which are three times more available in schools serving white kids than kids that serve mostly students of color or the four points you got if daddy went to michigan. %$* 35
they rally behind jennifer gratz, as the supposed victim of reverse discrimination because the year she was rejected, there were about 85 students of color who got into the michigan despite having lower scores and grades but they say nothing about the 1400—let me repeat— 1400 white students with lower grades and lower scores than jenny gratz, who got in. %$* 35
you see, less-qualified white people are no problem, but less-qualified people of color, my goodness, we can’t have that. %$* 35
they say nothing about the study from six weeks ago which found that for every one student of color, who receives any benefit from affirmative action in college there are at least two whites, for every one person of color two whites, who also didn’t meet the requirements but got in because daddy wrote a check, or mama made a phone call, or somebody pulled strings and got them in, but affirmative action for rich white people is never a problem for the folks like our opponents. %$* 35
while they insist affirmative action is racist because it holds people of color to lower standards the fact is, it is whites who have held to lower standards, it is whites and only whites i would suggest who can get c’s all the way through school, brag about their mediocrity publicly, mangle the english language, and go on to become presidents of the united states. %$* 35
so, when they lament the supposed damage done to student of color by affirmative action because it supposedly forces them to question their abilities, ask yourself, why no concern for the mental health and self-image of white americans, who have being preferred for 400 years, and if their argument is correct, must be the most self-hating people on the face of planet earth. %$* 35
and no, affirmative action doesn’t place people of color in positions for which they’re unqualified, indeed, once we control for economic status comparing only whites and folks of color from families with both the same income and wealth profile, there is no difference in college graduation rates, and only an insignificant difference in college grades. %$* 35
and black students at the most selective schools, actually do better in relation to their white counterparts than those in less-selective schools. %$* 35
furthermore according to 200 different studies on the subject—not just one that i’m pulling out of my ass but 200 different studies—employees who have benefited from affirmative action perform equal to or better than their white male counterparts once given a chance to improve themselves, so in closing, unless our opponents can show you that they have some alternative mechanism for addressing that legacy of white racial preference— %$* 35
—and the ongoing advantages extended to whites in this country, unless they can demonstrate some alternative means, by which true equal opportunity to flourish to vote for them, and to vote for ending affirmative action is to engage in an act of irresponsible racial aggression. %$* 35
it is to ignore the wisdom of dr. %$* 35
king who said quite clearly in 1963, quote, “whenever this issue of compensatory or preferential treatment is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror. %$* 35
the negro should be granted equality, they insist, but should ask for nothing more. %$* 35
while at first that seems unreasonable, in fact it is unrealistic, for it is obvious that if you take a man and put him at the starting line of a race, 300 years after another man, the first man would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up,” end of quote. %$* 35
and to end affirmative action even does violence to the logic displayed by ronald reagan, whose mention alongside the word logic, is rare, coming from me, but who said as governor of california, when signing into law that state’s affirmative action policy— %$* 35
i didn’t get my one-minute warning, but if i could finish the quote from— %$* 35
if i could finish the quote from— %$* 35
—reagan i’d appreciate it— %$* 35
that’s fine— %$* 35
one. %$* 33
—and the ongoing advantages extended to whites in this country, unless they can demonstrate some alternative means, by which true equal opportunity to flourish to vote for them, and to vote for ending affirmative action is to engage in an act of irresponsible racial aggression. %$* 35

thank you, tim wise, for that opening statement. %$* 33
i didn’t get my one-minute warning, but if i could finish the quote from— %$* 35
no, i think— %$* 33
if i could finish the quote from— %$* 35
no, i— %$* 33
—reagan i’d appreciate it— %$* 35
—i—i think everyone else in the room heard it, uh, tim, why don’t you take a seat, sorry, you’ll, you’ll have time later— %$* 33
that’s fine— %$* 35
thank you, tim wise. %$* 33
thank you, tim wise, for that statement, uh %$* 33
against the motion. %$* 33
i’ll say “one” still louder, uh, throughout the evening. %$* 33
uh, and now for a statement, uh, in favor of the motion “it’s time to end affirmative action,” uh, john mcwhorter, please go to the podium. %$* 33
i think that when we discuss, um, racial preferences and i am gonna largely restrict what i’m saying to racial preferences in universities although many of these things also apply to affirmative action as handled elsewhere %$* 36
we often are under the impression that what we’re talking about is something as simple as a tie-breaking process, a thumb on the scale, the idea being that, if qualifications are equal or more less equal between a black and a white candidate, that, one gives the nod to the black person. %$* 36
i personally would find nothing problematic with that policy, i don’t think most people would. %$* 36
and to the extent that it is generally implied, generally via omission, that that’s what we’re talking about when we talk about racial preferences and that we’re not talking about qualifications or test scores, or things that we don’t wanna talk about— then it’s understandable that there reigns a sense that, to be opposed to these racial preference policies means that a person must be naïve or unfeeling or have a sinister agenda or something like that, all of that is, is perfectly, perfectly understandable. %$* 36
and then certain words are used, “inequality,” “resegregation,” “white privilege,” “societal racism,” et cetera, and all of those concepts are important, there is a great deal of injustice in the country now and there always has been and we should think about it. %$* 36
but, those words also have a kind of rhetorical power that i think distracts us from the actual logic of the case here, and what racial justice is, that is how we actually solve the problems that i think we’re all concerned with. %$* 36
and %$* 36
from what i’ve seen over my years in discussing this question, there are certain basic facts about how racial preferences are played out, that were not often told, i don’t think that people who think differently than me are willfully ignoring these things, i think these things just don’t get out there very much but they are absolutely crucial, to evaluating this particular case, and in my remaining seven minutes and about 13 seconds i just wanna give you a few of those things, for one thing, affirmative action, racial preferences as we’re talking about, is not just a tie-breaker. %$* 36
if that’s really all this debate has been about, i never would’ve joined it. %$* 36
there are all sorts of things. %$* 36
in 1991, in terms of all of the students who were admitted to selective law schools, um, there were 420 black ones, 24 were admitted according to what the qualifications were considered to be appropriate for, for white and asian students, all the rest of them just based on the numbers wouldn’t have gotten in. %$* 36
i respect what tim wise has said, we have very different data in terms of the qualifications, if it were true the qualifications were the same, this would be a rather vacuous and petty debate. %$* 36
but the fact is, that according to anything that i know, they’re not. %$* 36
for example, one argument that we might hear before we leave tonight is that sat’s are meaningless. %$* 36
now there are dueling studies on that, i’m not sure exactly where one is to stand as a good-thinking person at this point. %$* 36
but certainly, it bears mentioning, that if you looked at uc berkeley undergraduates who were black and their graduation rates after 1988, they actually tracked in virtual lock-step with sat scores. %$* 36
the lower the score, the more likely the person was to graduate, that suggests to me something that i think all of us know deep down, which is that, no matter how you jigger the statistics, sat scores do mean something, not everything, of course, but they do mean something. %$* 36
or, for example, richard sandor has shown that, um %$* 36
with, um, black students admitted to 163 law schools, that, because so very many of them were admitted not according to the qualifications that they submitted but out of a sense of a commitment to diversity and lowering standards, that over half of them were in the bottom 10 percent of their class and that wasn’t only in they first year, and that there was a truly alarming rate of failing the bar exam. %$* 36
now, these are all difficult issues but things like this, and needless to say, i could go on for a very long time but i’ve only got eight minutes—they have to be brought into a debate like this, they cannot be ignored, they cannot be trivialized. %$* 36
these things are real. %$* 36
also, to eliminate racial preferences at selective universities does not deny black people an education. %$* 36
at uc san diego before the ban on racial preferences out in california, exactly one out of 3,268 freshmen who were black, were making honors. %$* 36
after the ban, 20 percent of black students were making honors, because the students who would have been admitted to berkeley or ucla were now admitted to uc-san diego. %$* 36
i think that was a good thing. %$* 36
it certainly wasn’t a bad thing. %$* 36
and it’s something that needs to be talked about. %$* 36
let’s talk a little bit about diversity, because i think that’s gonna come up. %$* 36
for one thing, i remember being in college, and this is purely anecdotal, but, the idea of someone calling on me in class to talk about, you know, my take on the black experience or what the black perspective on things was, was something that made me sweat bullets and i’ve heard this from countless black undergraduates, many of whom tell me when i’m doing a book tour that to them, that’s evidence that there’s racism at universities, that they’re expected to be diverse representatives. %$* 36
so we can talk about diversity, but, how does it actually feel to be a diverse person. %$* 36
more to the point. %$* 36
it’s often said that diversity has been proven to make for a better-quality education. %$* 36
has it? %$* 36
how. %$* 36
like if you’ve ever actually looked into that, the people who try to prove it with studies, and none of them are conservatives, find again and again, that, as i think we all knew, diversity does not really have anything to do with giving you a more beneficial experience in terms of how much knowledge you have in your head or how much moral wisdom you have in your head, after you come from college. %$* 36
there was a poll of university of michigan minority, um, law-school grads from 1970 to 1996.to them, being called on as a diverse person in class was at the very bottom of what they valued most about their experience as was the diversity. %$* 36
what they most valued in their experience was how smart teachers and their fellow students were, remember this is minority students. %$* 36
or, mitchell j.chang showed that in terms of diversity in your undergraduate experience, it did mean that you talked about race more on campus, but it didn’t mean that you had more friends of another race and it didn’t improve your gpa and it didn’t improve how you feel about going to college. %$* 36
stephen cole and elinor barber have shown that when black students are placed in schools where they actually would have been more appropriately placed in terms of qualifications and qualifications do matter, into schools like these, then, what happened is that they made lower grades which discouraged them from going to get ph.d.’s. %$* 36
this was a study done by good liberal people, they did not expect it. %$* 36
but that means that we have fewer black academics because of these policies. %$* 36
now based on the things that i’ve mentioned, and clear— %$* 36
—clearly they belong at the table. %$* 36
i do wanna say one thing. %$* 36
the idea that all of these sorts of things that i’ve discussed, and the fact that there are other ways of addressing this problem, are there, and they’re worth talking about. %$* 36
the notion that anybody would say, that, a legacy student is something that black students should be proud to compare themselves to, or, that a legacy student is something that is okay, i— i—i don’t get it, i met legacy students when i was in school, it was not a pretty picture. %$* 36
i certainly do not agree with these legacy policies, however, because i’m black, i’m talking about this kind of policy as it is applied to people of my race because i think that it hurts them. %$* 36
i’m not gonna make some hoary argument about the constitution, or something like that. %$* 36
i don’t think that it helps black students to be the best that they can be. %$* 36
and i think i’ll stop there. %$* 36
but there are issues in this debate that we simply don’t hear about. %$* 36
it’s not as simple as just being against resegregation— %$* 36
—and calling for diversity, thank you— %$* 36

john mcwhorter— %$* 33
—and calling for diversity, thank you— %$* 36
you can stop right there, in fact. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 33
uh, john mcwhorter, thank you for that statement, uh, supporting the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action.” uh, now a statement from khin mai aung, against the motion. %$* 33
well, one thing that john mcwhorter’s right about is that we are gonna talk about diversity today and, it’s not bec— i’m not advocating it because i believe that every black person has the same experience, and ‘cause i believe that black people should have to carry the mantle of the black experience for our educational benefit, any more than i represent the same perspective as any other asian person. %$* 37
i wanna tell you a little story about, um, my own experience, very recently i, i bought a house, um, in the ditmas park area of brooklyn. %$* 37
and it’s been, um, heralded as the most diverse census track in the country. %$* 37
and so when i moved there, i found that, you know, the adults, they were, they were a little bit more hesitant to mix. %$* 37
um, but the—but the young people at the, at the, at the pizza place, hung out, uh, with people of all different backgrounds, and little kids at the, at the, uh, playground were willing to play with each other, from all different backgrounds. %$* 37
and, this is something that i value. %$* 37
it’s to something that i think is easy, it’s not something that i think comes naturally. %$* 37
but it’s something that’ll only happen when people go to school together, when people are exposed to each other. %$* 37
and, preferably at an earlier age, and also in, in, in higher education. %$* 37
and you— so you should vote with us, if you agree with that statement, if you agree that a racially diverse environment is beneficial. %$* 37
if you believe that diversity enhances the educational experience, and that diversity is good for business and the economy. %$* 37
you should also vote with us, if you want a level playing field, not a false meritocracy, that is actually full of hidden benefits for the children of donors and legacies. %$* 37
now, some of you may be wondering why i, a lawyer at the asian-american legal defense and education fund, is here speaking out in support of affirmative action. %$* 37
foes of affirmative action often like to say that asians are the ones that are most harmed by affirmative action, that’s simply not true. %$* 37
first of all, many asian groups, southeast asians in particular who face numerous educational disadvantages, need and benefit from affirmative action in all contexts and in particular, higher education. %$* 37
and all asian-americans need and benefit from affirmative action employment. %$* 37
so, i wanna echo what tim wise said is that we’re talking not just about diversity, about, uh, affirmative action in education, we’re talking about affirmative action in a variety of different contexts, including education, public contracting and so forth. %$* 37
and we’re also not just talking about a black and white paradigm, we’re talking about how affirmative action benefits other people of color, as well as women. %$* 37
so you should vote for us. %$* 37
if you value a diverse and inclusive society, and want a broad variety of experiences and viewpoints represented at our most prestigious, uh, educational institutions and workplaces. %$* 37
business leaders have long realized the value of diversity. %$* 37
when the university of michigan’s affirmative action programs were challenged before the united states supreme court, 65 leading american businesses, and their ceo’s filed a brief in support of affirmative action. %$* 37
these included american express, chevron and microsoft, boeing, nike, and the list goes on. %$* 37
they realized that the leaders of tomorrow needed exposure to diverse people, ideas and perspectives. %$* 37
these companies found that individuals educated in a diverse setting were more likely to succeed and they had very concrete, concrete examples of, of these benefits. %$* 37
they believed that—they realized that people who were educated in a diverse setting were more likely to facilitate creative problem-solving approaches, they would—they can develop progra—uh, uh, products that appeal to a diverse customer base. %$* 37
they are better able to work with diverse business partners, clients and employees, and they’re more likely to contribute to a positive work environment. %$* 37
these companies need, and i quote, “the talent and creativity of a workplace that is”— or workforce rather—“that is as diverse as the world around them.” minority professionals are also more likely to provide needed services to underserved communities. %$* 37
and this has been found in studies about minority doctors. %$* 37
um, incidentally i—i think that this point was acknowledged by my colleague john mcwhorter on the other side. %$* 37
in a study by the new—that was published in the new england journal of medicine in 1996, it found that black and latino communities were four times more likely to have a shortage of doctors, and, incidentally, black doctors tend to practice in communities with five times as many blacks as communities where other doctors practice. %$* 37
they also have more black patients, and more medicaid patients. %$* 37
latino doctors, similarly, tend to practice in communities with twice as many latinos as communities where other doctors are, and they also have more latino patients and more uninsured patients. %$* 37
you should also vote with us if you believe in leveling the playing field. %$* 37
women and minorities still face obstacles gaining admissions to our most selective universities and workplaces. %$* 37
and the college board’s own studies show that sat’s are skewed in favor of whites and the wealthy. %$* 37
so, yeah, do i say the sat’s meaningless, probably not. %$* 37
but, what is that meaning and who is it skewed in favor of, des—and despite these advantages that whites still have with standardized tests, there are still twice as many whites as minorities with below-average scores, in the top universities and this is because they’re legacies or the kids of donors. %$* 37
legacies are three times more likely than general population to be admitted at harvard and two and a half more times at yale and over half of legacies are admitted at dartmouth and penn. %$* 37
now turning to asian-americans, foes of affirmative action as i said love to use as a poster child for who would benefit if affirmative action ended and this is just not true. %$* 37
first of all, asians have voted decisively in favor of affirmative action, in both california and michigan when these policies were challenged. %$* 37
and, now, it’s true that some asian-american students have done remarkably well in higher education, and these are disproportionately the children of highly-educated professionals, who immigrated here predominantly from, um, east asia and south asia starting with the change in immigration laws in the 1960s. %$* 37
but there are other asian-american students that face considerable educational barriers. %$* 37
in particular southeast asians, who are the children of refugees who fled here after the vietnam war, from cambodia, laos, and vietnam. %$* 37
i do a lot of my work in lowell, massachusetts, which is the second-largest cambodian enclave in the country. %$* 37
a third of lowell’s schoolchildren are asian, predominantly cambodian. %$* 37
but, 45 percent, a disproportionate number of lowell’s school—of lowell’s dropouts and students who are dismissed for sev—severe truancy are asian-american. %$* 37
almost one in two hmong, and the hmong are, um, an ethnic group that hails from laos, and over one in four cambodians in the united states have had no formal schooling whatsoever. %$* 37
in the affirmative action plans endorsed by the united states supreme court and the university of michigan cases, you can consider a broad array of, of diversity factors, of which being—coming from a family of southeast asian refugees, can count. %$* 37
proposition 209 ended affirmative action in california in 1996.coincidentally this was the same year that i graduated from boalt hall school of law, and as an aside, it was the diversity at boalt, which was—boalt was very diverse at the time—that in part inspired me to be a civil-rights lawyer. %$* 37
and after— %$* 37
—after affirmative action ended, diversity within the asian- american population has suffered at—at most selective university of california schools. %$* 37
at boalt hall school of law, there were more than four times as may filipinos, and—with affirmative action than without, and overall the number of asian-americans has dropped by 1 percent at all uc law schools in the first three years without affirmative action. %$* 37
whites on the other hand increased by 12 percent. %$* 37
at uc berkeley undergrad, a study by the southeast asia resource action center found less than 50 total cambodian that’s far less than 1 percent, fif—less than 50 total cambodian and lao, at uc-berkeley in 1993.and the case for affirmative action in employment is even clearer for asian-americans, there’s less than 1 percent of partners in major law firms are asian-american and less than 1 percent of senior managers at fortune 1000 and fortune 500 firms. %$* 37
that’s very similar to the weights of representation for blacks and latinos, but of white men are 97 percent of senior partners, of senior management, at fortune 1000 and fortune 100 firms, even though they’re only— %$* 37
—43 percent of the workplace— %$* 37
—of the workforce, thank you very much— %$* 37
one. %$* 33

—for that, opening statement. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 33
uh, before we—now before we hear from terence pell and later, uh, kim crenshaw, i have—i have a couple of quick questions, uh, for panelists who, who have spoken already or a couple of them, first i’d just like to ask, uh, uh, joseph phillips, i’ll ask you— how do you answer the argument that was made by, uh, among others general norman schwarzkopf in the amicus brief in the michigan case, that the military needs, for reasons of, of morale and, uh, national security it needs black and hispanic officers, and to have an professional number of senior black and hispanic officers, one of the tools is affirmative action. %$* 33
uh, is that a reason for which you would say %$* 33
okay, i’d, i’d prefer that result than whatever other result might emerge from color-blindness in the process— %$* 33
no, i would answer him, uh, with the words of colin powell. %$* 34
who in talking about affirmative action, talked about color-blindness. %$* 34
uh, and, and, um, i can’t remember the exact quote but what colin powell says, is that if you’re talking about, um %$* 34
removing barriers, if you’re talking about non-discrimination %$* 34
so that, uh, then, then he’s all for it, i’m all for it, everyone here is for it. %$* 34
if you’re talking about putting people, uh, in places of, of, uh %$* 34
over, over the, uh %$* 34
not the ruling of men, but, you know %$* 34
office, officers over groups of men, who, uh, are not qualified, that is not what colin powell endorses and i’m positive, that that is not what, uh, norman schwarzkopf— %$* 34
and so in being selected for some program that might lead one to advancement, that selection process should be absolutely color- blind, not, not look to make sure you’re sending up a couple of minority candidates up for the, with the group, regardless of, uh, of, of, of metrics. %$* 33
no, of course not, i think that that, uh, that that clearly undermines the confidence that you need to have, uh, in a fighting unit. %$* 34
okay. %$* 33
uh, tim wise, i have a—a brief question for you. %$* 33
if race- conscious %$* 33
uh, policies of the government have created the, uh, the inequities %$* 33
right— %$* 35
—that you’ve cited, and you feel that race-conscious policies are justified in redressing them— %$* 33
right. %$* 35
—uh, how far would you go, what about race-conscious tax policies, why don’t we have, uh, refundable tax credits for members of minorities and you and i can play, uh, the alternative male-whiteness tax, we pay the a— %$* 33
right—right— %$* 35
—amwt, and that way we can go right to the end result of the unfair competition and redress it. %$* 33
right. %$* 35
or—or do you draw the line at color-blindness— %$* 33
no, i—i would—look, the example you give i wouldn’t endorse but i would endorse the government of the united states, and those corporations and their existing entities that stem from other entities in past generations— %$* 35
mmm. %$* 33
—that profited from and made possible the institutionalizing of white and white preference— %$* 35
but why not an extra exemption for minorities— %$* 33
i would say—i wouldn’t do it in tax policy, i would, i believe, and we can come back and debate the issue of substantive repair and restoration and reparation some other time. %$* 35
we’re not here to debate it tonight, i would support the government doing that, i’m not saying, white folks should take our checkbook and have a line item for black people. %$* 35
you know, but, but i would suggest that the government, which made possible the institutionalization of this systemic inequality, has an obligation to rectify it by many means of which affirmative action is one. %$* 35
it’s not the only one, and it may very well not be the best one. %$* 35
but it’s one and it’s the one we’re here to discuss tonight— %$* 35
all right— %$* 33
—and to get rid of it won’t bring us to any of the other, possibly better options that we could discuss at a—at a later time— %$* 35
okay, more discussion to come, thank you, uh, tim, and, and, uh, more opening statements, uh, first from terence pell speaking, uh, for the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action.” %$* 33
uh, thank you. %$* 38
uh, look, for the last 40 years america’s been engaged in a massive social experiment, to see whether the use of racial preferences could bring about the full integration of american soci—society. %$* 38
the question tonight is whether these preferential policies can deliver on that promise. %$* 38
and the question need not be abstract nor need it divide liberals and conservatives. %$* 38
that’s because in the last decade, a growing body of data has become available, that helps us get a handle on the trade-off between attending an elite institution, on the basis of different admissions standards, or attending a less prestigious institution. %$* 38
let’s start with the effect of racial preferences, uh, in undergraduate colleges. %$* 38
i’m going to focus on one specific academic area, namely science. %$* 38
not many minority students enter science, and many who do drop out along the way. %$* 38
blacks receive about 5.3 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in science, despite making up about 9 percent of the college enrollment. %$* 38
well research into these disparities by dartmouth psychologist rogers elliot, provides a template of the kinds of questions we should be asking not just in the area of science, but in every area, where preferential policies are employed. %$* 38
because it turns out that the preferences themselves, are part of the problem. %$* 38
the first thing that elliot’s data does, is dispel the assumption that non-asian minority students somehow aren’t interested in science. %$* 38
in fact, high-achieving black and hispanic high school seniors, are more interested in majoring in science, than whites. %$* 38
the second thing the data tells us is that the really elite research universities, the schools that recruit the most promising students, black and white, use significant racial preferences to enroll the most gifted and talented black and—black and hispanic undergraduates. %$* 38
elliot’s nineteen ninety-sev—1997 study, fo—which focused on four ivy league schools, found that the mean sat math score for black students was 100 points below that of white students. %$* 38
that difference was about 1.6 times this—sorry, 1.6 standard deviations of the white scores. %$* 38
this means that the black mean was not only below the white mean, it was so far below the white mean that the majority of black students had scores in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution of scores of all students. %$* 38
now right away this significant use of race preferences by the most elite schools is significant. %$* 38
the fact that the very top schools, that have their pick of the best students, are using preferences of this magnitude, suggests that the next tier of schools are likely using greater preferences, and in fact, second-tier schools do use greater preferences, about 15 percent larger than those used by the top schools. %$* 38
as a consequence, many black and hispanic students up and down the line are attending schools where their credentials are significantly out of line with those of their, uh, classmates. %$* 38
well one possible response at this point, and we may hear this later on tonight, is to say that the sat math score doesn’t fairly measure black academic success. %$* 38
one could even deny that admitting black students with lower sat math scores amounts to a preference. %$* 38
well, we could debate this all night, but the research on this point is undisputed. %$* 38
if anything grades and sat scores over-predict black performance. %$* 38
so admitting blacks and hispanics with significantly lower test scores and grades make it all but certain that blacks and hispanics as a group, will get lower grades as—in college, and that’s just what elliot found. %$* 38
blacks interested in science at these schools had grades almost a full gpa lower than whites. %$* 38
for many students, many minority students this made it difficult to continue in science, and elliot found that only a third of the blacks who started in science, at elite schools, uh, completed a degree in science. %$* 38
the rest switched majors, or dropped out altogether. %$* 38
uh, and this rate was twice the rate of white students at those schools. %$* 38
second, uh, the lower grades of those who did finish disadvantaged them significantly both in going on to graduate school, and getting jobs. %$* 38
well, if the story ended here you might think that test-score gaps make it highly unlikely that blacks will ever, or a significant number of blacks will ever succeed in science. %$* 38
uh, this would be a very dreary conclusion if it were true but the fact is, it’s not true. %$* 38
this is where the data tells us something very interesting, it helps us get a handle on the real problem with preferential policies, because it turns out that the absolute value of a students math sat score and high school grades, is less important, as the relative difference between one’s credentials, and those of his or her classmates. %$* 38
how do we know this. %$* 38
well, it turns out that black students interested in science, who attend schools where their math sat scores more closely match that of other students, persist in science at much higher rates, even though the average sat scores at these schools is lower. %$* 38
so for example, howard university, a historically black college, has average sat math scores of about 450, well below the mean of the, at the, the, uh, sat score, at the elite schools we’ve been discussing, yet howard is the top producer of black undergraduate science and engineering degrees in the country. %$* 38
what’s more, a large percentage of undergraduate science majors at howard and other historically black colleges, go on to get ph.d.’s in science. %$* 38
of the top 21 undergraduate producers of black ph.d.’s in the country, 17 of them, 17 of the 21, are historically black colleges, and none are among the 30 or so most selective schools that routinely recruit the most talented black high school students. %$* 38
and so what we have is this perverse system. %$* 38
the institutions with the poorest track records for producing black ph.d.’s in science, are getting the best minority students, and then, driving them out of science at twice the rate of white students. %$* 38
and the institutions with the best track record, are getting the middling students, and then, producing the overwhelming majority of black ph.d.’s in science. %$* 38
well what lessons can we draw from this. %$* 38
first, the existence of racial inequalities in society which nobody on this side of the table denies, is not a sufficient justification for preferential policies. %$* 38
it’s bad enough that african-americans are so substantially underrepresented in science. %$* 38
it’s completely inexcusable that racial preferences end up frustrating and discouraging the gifted black high school seniors who say they want to study science. %$* 38
second, it is misleading to evaluate racial preferences in the abstract, as if we’re talking about one— %$* 38
—or two institutions that use preferences in a handful of deserving cases. %$* 38
what we’re dealing with, the problem that we’ve got, is the systematic use of racial preferences by every single institution of higher education in the country. %$* 38
i’ve used my time to focus on one specific problem in some detail, but a growing body of research shows similar effects in many other areas. %$* 38

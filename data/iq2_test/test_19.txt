that's right, i'm a ph.d., remember. %$* 52
right, and i'm a political scientist, so i would mention this in social welfare. %$* 53
how well-- %$* 53
how much social welfare is there? %$* 53
i look at the gold standard and, i'm sorry, i don't think dickens is an outlier; there were plenty of american dickens and the equivalent, and a lot of our families lived those lives, right? %$* 53
i think that the point is is that is the future, which is what we're living now, more successful than the past, than what the gold standard was? %$* 53
and i can't-- %$* 53
unfortunately this is not-- %$* 53
i'd like to be a great social scientists and say i'm going to run a-- %$* 53
run a test here, but i can't run the test with the gold standard. %$* 53
other side. %$* 13
james grant. %$* 13
you know, there is, implicit in our opponent's line of argument, the idea that monetary thought runs in a line of progress from ancient times to the present, and we're now at the pinnacle of monetary technique and knowledge with and with %$* 55
that's the implicit argument. %$* 55
monetary thought does not run in a line of constant improvement, nor does human thought. %$* 55
hugh trevor-roper wrote about a wonderful essay about the reappearance of witchcraft in the high renaissance, and during this period in which enlightenment supposedly prevailed around the earth, the leading lights of western thought were actually captive in this most cruel hoax of witchcraft. %$* 55
i submit to you that posterity looking back on this moment in monetary affairs will look upon the doings of the world central banks that have, as i say, alighted into a kind of a makeshift central planning from what is meant to be a very simple act. %$* 55
a central bank may look upon this as a period of kind of the dark ages of monetary application and thought. %$* 55
this-- %$* 55
let's hear from steve forbes. %$* 13
money simply enables you to buy and sell with each other, and that's why it has a fixed value, so if you sell a loaf-- %$* 54
a bottle of wine and you want to get four loaves of bread in return, you suddenly don't find because the currencies change you only get three and a half or you get four and a half. %$* 54
it just makes exchange easier. %$* 54
now, if you don't get fiscal policy right, you don't get regulation right, and things like that, you won't grow. %$* 54
but all it means is you have a fixed measure, just like 12 inches in a foot, for crying out loud, just a fixed measure. %$* 54
and if people realize that tonight, then a lot of mischief will be undone. %$* 54
remember, median incomes in this country have fallen in the last 10 years because of this funny money. %$* 54
when you have stability-- %$* 54
that's nothing to do with it. %$* 52
a chance to get ahead. %$* 54
so-- %$* 52
listen, your point is a fixed measure in terms of gold, but there are lot of other elements of what we buy during the day. %$* 52
in fact, the cpi has very little gold in it. %$* 52
a smidgeon, but very little. %$* 52
tell us all what cpi stands for. %$* 13
we need stability in terms of the bask of goods and-- %$* 52
unpack the term cpi for-- %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry, cpi is the consumer price index. %$* 52
sir. %$* 13
hi, i'm roy most of the arguments i've heard have been in the context of economic cycles, but i'm worried about the fact that the world could lose confidence in the united states just like it's lost confidence in other-- %$* 18
like a ge that was a aaa company and decided that, you know, going into the lending business was a good idea. %$* 18
well, it wasn't. %$* 18
so how would you, on the for the motion side, recast your arguments in terms of confidence in the united states and what the united states has to do to keep that confidence. %$* 18
so we actually-- %$* 52
we do need confidence in terms of-- %$* 52
in terms of not having inflation move around a lot. %$* 52
in fact, when we've had a problem is when we pursued extremely inflationary policies. %$* 52
in fact, this is why we went off bretton woods, because we actually had a situation of very bad monetary policy and also bad fiscal policy as a result of fighting the vietnam war and some serious mistakes that were made. %$* 52
so stability-- %$* 52
and by the way, we came-- %$* 53
i would argue we came very close to that under the second bush administration fighting the iraq war. %$* 53
we spent too much money and we had-- %$* 53
we've had some issues since then. %$* 53
so i think stability is very key, that people do have to know that the dollar will actually purchase a similar amount of goods and services over time. %$* 52
that, we’re in agreement of. %$* 52
i don’t think there’s really disagreement among us. %$* 52
the question is, what’s the best way to get that to happen? %$* 52
fixing the dollar to gold is not the best way to get that to happen. %$* 52
is anybody cooking on that moral dimension question? %$* 13
up here. %$* 19
yeah. %$* 13
we got a moral person. %$* 52
i’m going to call on you. %$* 13
let’s get the mic up to you. %$* 13
and, but i’ll tell you, because i can’t see you, that it likely means-- %$* 13
i’ll just speak loudly. %$* 19
no, no, the camera needs to see you. %$* 13
where are you? %$* 13
i mean i’m still talking to, for my vision to a-- %$* 13
i’m up in the second row here. %$* 19
are you upstairs? %$* 13
come running downstairs. %$* 13
i’m going to go to another question and we’ll take your question in the aisle, seriously. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
considering that the u.s. economy is 70 percent consumption based, is it better for the state of the economy to enhance the purchasing power of those consumers or diminish the purchasing power of those consumers over time? %$* 18
neither. %$* 52
let’s keep-- %$* 52
rick mishkin. %$* 13
a situation where, when you go out and buy something, it, it costs about the same thing over time, so that you can plan, very simple. %$* 52
your side would agree with that line of thinking, yes? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 55
james grant. %$* 13
i would, yes, agree, well done rick. %$* 55
giddy yap baby, giddy yap. %$* 52
where’s our visitor from upstairs? %$* 13
it’s not hard to get downstairs from there is it? %$* 13
it’s not complicated. %$* 13
i’m afraid i got her lost. %$* 13
we’ll take a few more questions, you in the blue shirt. %$* 13
yeah, the mike’s coming down there on your left side. %$* 13
henry sandberg steve forbes made a point that a weak dollar policy leads to potential currency wars and better thy neighbor policies. %$* 18
for mr. %$* 18
mishkin and mr. %$* 18
taylor, do you see this as a potential issue for a weak dollar policy? %$* 18
in fact, i actually strongly oppose a policy which says we’re going to focus on the dollar. %$* 52
a weak dollar policy is not something i’d advocate either. %$* 52
and the reason is this, is exactly is, is you’re focused on how your exports are doing well to competitors. %$* 52
and that’s not a great way to do policy. %$* 52
central banks and policy makers throughout the world should try to stabilize their economies. %$* 52
and in fact, whatever way the value of the currencies go in that context, so be it. %$* 52
steve forbes. %$* 13
well you don’t get a long term good economic growth with an unstable currency. %$* 54
a weak dollar’s always meant a weak recovery. %$* 54
and what nation has become great with a weak currency? %$* 54
ma’am, it’s your turn. %$* 13
let’s get the mic to you. %$* 13
i wonder what you’re going to ask. %$* 13
it’s not specifically moral, but it is a global-- %$* 19
no, it is, it is. %$* 19
i hope it’s not immoral. %$* 52
let’s get it right here. %$* 52
well maybe-- %$* 19
what’s your name please? %$* 13
robin bluementhal from barron’s, thank you. %$* 19
given the fact that we have a much more interdependent economy with a lot more participants in the third world-- %$* 19
in the developing nations, etcetera, and a lot of talk recently about currency wars, could the panelists please address the question of how having a fixed rate of currency would affect the rest of the world and whether it would do something to perhaps stop this kind of snowball effect? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
steve forbes. %$* 13
most countries would prefer stable currencies, because it makes trade that much easier. %$* 54
and capital flows that much easier. %$* 54
which is why in africa, you have 14 nations that are attached to the euro, 13 nations that have currency boards where they attach to a currency. %$* 54
so among our trading partners, they find it very disruptive when the dollar goes all over the place and their currencies wobble up and down. %$* 54
so in terms of stability, yes, it would be good for developing countries, because it would facilitate trade and facilitate the trade of capital. %$* 54
you never get ahead in a sustained way, productive way, by fooling around with your money, any more than you would changing, what now, feet in a mile. %$* 54
steve, what did you mean earlier, what did you mean earlier that a weak dollar breaks a sacred trust? %$* 13
and that was the moral issue that you brought up, which sounds like it’s much more about the practicality, there’s something else you’re talking about there. %$* 13
yes, because it undermines social trust. %$* 54
we depend on trust. %$* 54
when you go to the restaurant, you trust-- %$* 54
to pay the bill. %$* 54
when you go on an airplane, you trust that these people know what they're doing, and when you do transactions, you trust that you get in return what you've been promised, and you'll give what you promised. %$* 54
and with an unstable currency, what it does is undermine hard work and productive effort and give undue rewards to speculation, undue rewards to commodities. %$* 54
that's why oil has gone from 21 to 90 or $100 a barrel. %$* 54
that's why you saw this speculation mad, speculation in housing instead of productive facilities or finding cures to diseases. %$* 54
so it misdirects investment. %$* 54
we saw that in the '70s, huge investment in farmland and commodities. %$* 54
they crashed in the '80s. %$* 54
those investments had to be liquidated. %$* 54
a lot of wasted capital. %$* 54
stability, again, it's just a measure of value. %$* 54
all right, i want to add respond to that issue. %$* 13
i also want the dollar to be a good measure of value, but this is an issue about having low and stable inflation. %$* 52
it's not tying to gold. %$* 52
inflation means you're debasing the value of the money. %$* 54
the value of the dollar, it has to do with inflation, and i don't think there's anybody in this panel that is advocating any kind of inflation. %$* 53
or deflation for that matter. %$* 52
well maybe you because you said you like it at one period. %$* 52
to two and a half percent inflation which means higher prices. %$* 54
how does that enrich people when you raise their prices? %$* 54
no, the people sitting around this room spend 99.-something or other percent of their dollars in the u.s.economy. %$* 53
it doesn't really matter whether the euro goes up or down 1 percent in one day or the next. %$* 53
what it matters is that the inflation that impacts everything that we consume on a daily basis, impacts our pay, is stable and is understandable to us. %$* 53
problem. %$* 53
is there any merit to steve's moral argument, which is essentially saying that people make a deal that when they get a dollar and they put it in a bank, in 10 years, it's still going to be worth what it was when they earned it. %$* 13
is there a moral argument to that? %$* 13
is there a social trust that's broken? %$* 13
the social trust in not having situation of having very high inflation, and we agree on that. %$* 52
the question is what is the best-- %$* 52
i use the word "technology," but the best way of getting that to happen, and my view on this is that in fact we do not get the stability that steve would like to see us have %$* 52
rick, you are proposing-- %$* 55
you're proposing that the current regime of literally unprecedented central bank activism is one for the ages. %$* 55
this-- %$* 55
you must-- %$* 55
we must step back a second and realize what's going on in the world. %$* 55
central banks are conjuring 100s of billions of dollars a year, trillions, from nowhere on the theory, mind you, on the theory that by so doing, they will enhance what is universally a lousy state of trade. %$* 55
this is unprecedented. %$* 55
and on that note, i have to announce that this concludes round two of this intelligence squared debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is, "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." remember, you voted before the debate. %$* 13
we're about to have closing statements. %$* 13
that's round three, and right after that, you'll vote a second time, and in that way, you will declare our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." and here to argue against the motion, which means he is for a strong dollar policy, james grant, editor and founder of grant's interest rate observer. %$* 13
buzz, buzz, buzz. %$* 13
i'm going to do that again because i needed-- %$* 13
you all missed the applause cue-- %$* 13
so badly. %$* 13
so i want to introduce james again and give him that robust welcome that you've been doing all night, thanks. %$* 13
no, no, no, no-- %$* 13
we're really out of sync now, i'm going to introduce him again, and when i say his name, then that would be the moment, thanks. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, james grant, editor and founder of grant's interest rate observer. %$* 13
you know, laura ingalls wilder wrote a wonderful series of books entitled, "little house on the prairie." and one of these books was the biography of her future husband called "farmer boy." it was about the life of a hardscrabble dairy farmer and his family in upstate new york. %$* 55
this was during the 1880s when, contrary to anna schwartz, america was on fire-- %$* 55
but from a very low base. %$* 55
people were not wealthy. %$* 55
and one day, the farmer took his son to the fair, summertime, and lemonade was on sale. %$* 55
and the kid screwed up his courage and asked for a nickel to buy a round of lemonade for his friends, and the father astonishingly produced from his jeans a 50 cent piece. %$* 55
the child was speechless, and the father asked him, not wanting to let a moment go by without instruction, asked if he knew what that was, this coin. %$* 55
and the kid, of course, said nothing, how could we say anything? %$* 55
he was literally struck numb. %$* 55
and the father said, "it's money," so he asked the son, "son, do you know what money is? %$* 55
" again, silence. %$* 55
and the boy said, "i-- %$* 55
" and the father said, "money is work." and money is the stored value of work; this is the moral of the question. %$* 55
so you work all day and you earn something for it and that something is called money, and you save some of that because there are only so many heartbeats and a lifetime is precious, you save some of it for later. %$* 55
now, what our opponents would like you to-- %$* 55
would like you to believe is that through the most dexterous use of advanced mathematics they can calibrate the rate of depreciation in that money so that you will-- %$* 55
won't even notice it. %$* 55
but steve and i are here to tell you that you will notice it, and we are also here to tell you that the ways of higher mathematics are not the ways towards price stability. %$* 55
what is attempted today is unique and it will not work. %$* 55
vote against this proposition. %$* 55
thank you. %$* 13
james grant. %$* 13
and our motion is america does not need a strong dollar policy, and here to make that argument and sum up his position, john taylor, chairman and founder of fx concepts. %$* 13
i'm against a strong dollar policy, just to make sure that you know what i'm arguing against here. %$* 53
if stability is the goal of government and of government policy, then it must lean against the wind, whichever way that wind is blowing. %$* 53
if the economy is growing too fast, it must act to slow the economy; and if the economy is growing too slowly, it must act to speed it up. %$* 53
that is the policy that the government has been following for at least since world war ii.that policy, at least according to jan tinbergen, who did win a nobel prize in economics, the first one, given in 1953, said that there were four independent variables that drove the government's ability to control the economy and the economic outputs that are important to the people who live there. %$* 53
and so that's why i'm worried about the social welfare of the people. %$* 53
those policies were money growth, interest rate levels, fiscal policy, i.e., the level of taxing and the level of spending, and the currency value. %$* 53
currency value was one of the four instruments that was chosen to manage the government output. %$* 53
that was in 19-- %$* 53
actually, earlier than 1953.the nobel prize is never given to somebody who's done the work right then. %$* 53
but was involved with the bretton woods situation, and it was even-- %$* 53
by one of the leading economists of the world recognized that even under that time-- %$* 53
that currency movement was critical to keeping the world moving forward. %$* 53
so my argument is that we should have a flexible policy that allows us to lean into the wind, or lean, -against it, depending on which way we need the government to act. %$* 53
and so, therefore, we need that flexibility and we are against a strong dollar policy. %$* 53
thank you. %$* 13
john taylor. %$* 13
our motion is america does not need a strong dollar policy, and here to argue against the motion, meaning he is for a strong dollar policy, steve forbes, chairman and editor in chief of forbes media. %$* 13
thank you, thank you. %$* 54
keynes was right about over time when you weaken a currency you do undermine the social order. %$* 54
ask yourselves, why is it that two incomes in the family can't seem to do what one income could do 40 years ago? %$* 54
it's been gradual, but it's been acidic, very real. %$* 54
what the federal reserve is doing is the equivalent of what you might call the federal reserve diet. %$* 54
how much raising the number of ounces in a pound from 16 to 20? %$* 54
your weight goes down 20 percent; if you weigh 200 pounds, suddenly you're 160 pounds; you weigh 150, suddenly you weigh 120.the fed could do the same thing with a mirror that makes you look svelte and thin. %$* 54
this way obesity goes away, this way you can eat more, weigh less, and look thinner. %$* 54
well, put that way, it is absolutely ridiculous thinking if you change a measure of something that, therefore, you can achieve a desired result. %$* 54
inflation is the equivalent of changing the number of ounces in a pound or changing how a mirror makes you look, it is distortive, ridiculous, and destructive. %$* 54
inflation is legalized counterfeiting, whether it’s two percent a year or 20 percent. %$* 54
dollar should be a fixed measure of value. %$* 54
it’s simply a yardstick, to make transactions easier. %$* 54
otherwise, it’s like a virus in a computer. %$* 54
it corrupts the information; you can’t trust prices. %$* 54
you get a decline in personal incomes, weakening social trust, distortion and misdirection of investment into things that, hard assets instead of things of the future. %$* 54
and also as a transfer of wealth, to nations that are not very friendly to the united states. %$* 54
whatever angle you look at, again, you’re not going to make yourself wealthy by fooling around with the integrity of the u.s.dollar. %$* 54
there are other ways you do it, hard work, risk taking, and the like. %$* 54
thank you. %$* 54
thank you steve forbes. %$* 13
our motion is america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy, and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, he does not think america needs a strong dollar policy, frederick mishkin. %$* 13
he’s professor of banking and financial institutions at columbia business school. %$* 13
so i’m not going to use higher mathematics. %$* 52
in fact, that’s never been really part of this discussion. %$* 52
but i do want to talk about history. %$* 52
and in fact, there’s a very wonderful example about what happens when you pursue a strong currency policy. %$* 52
it happened to deal with a great man who was great in helping save the world against hitler, but was not a very good economist. %$* 52
he was not a very good chancellor of the exchequer, which is the equivalent of the finance minister, or secretary of the treasury, and this is winston churchill. %$* 52
but what the u.k.decided to do after world war i, was to pursue a strong pound policy. %$* 52
they went back on the dollar-- %$* 52
on the pound-- %$* 52
excuse me, they went back on the gold standard in 1925.they started taking measures to do this starting right after the war. %$* 52
what was the result of this? %$* 52
well, in order to do this they actually had very tight monetary policy, very high interest rates. %$* 52
were they successful? %$* 52
absolutely, in 1925, they went back on gold. %$* 52
what was the outcome? %$* 52
the outcome was, that we had, the british had very high unemployment, they went to over 11 percent employment in 1921.they then had extremely high unemployment all through the roaring 20s when everybody else was doing wonderfully. %$* 52
then of course it got worse. %$* 52
but then even more important to the current situation, they actually were trying to be virtuous. %$* 52
they had 130 percent of debt, sovereign debt, of their government debt relative to gdp after world war i, because it was so costly to fight it, they actually pursued very, very large, a budget surpluses, excluding interest payments. %$* 52
what happened to them? %$* 52
well, they went 140 percent of gdp in 1919, by the time you got to 1929, they were 170 percent of gdp.so indeed, in this current juncture, where in fact we have to worry about fiscal consolidation, this ended up doing several things. %$* 52
it meant it killed the economy. %$* 52
they actually had deflation. %$* 52
you talked-- %$* 52
jim grant talked about deflation as being a good thing during a period of american history. %$* 52
it certainly was not a good thing for the british. %$* 52
and what did you end up with? %$* 52
you ended up with a much more dire fiscal situation, even when there was virtue. %$* 52
a strong dollar policy would be something that would be very damaging to the economy and we do not need a strong dollar policy. %$* 52
thank you rick mishkin. %$* 13
and that concludes the closing statements and the final round of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you to vote the second time now. %$* 13
go to the keypads at your seats and register where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
after hearing the arguments, and we’ll see how it compares to your vote before you heard the arguments. %$* 13
the motion is this: america does not need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, to be clear, is the team that was against a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
if you agree with them, push number one. %$* 13
if you agree with the other team, america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy is the-- %$* 13
actually i think i’ve confused myself now. %$* 13
ignore what i just said, because i’m sure you’ve got it. %$* 13
you heard the argument. %$* 13
if you’re with these guys, push number one. %$* 13
if you’re with these guys, push number two. %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 13
i knew it was going to happen at some point. %$* 13
but i’ll just restate it. %$* 13
our motion is, america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you are, or remain, or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
the system will correct any mis-push. %$* 13
the other keys are inactive and we’ll have the vote in just a few seconds. %$* 13
but while the votes are being tabulated, i first of all want to say that the spirit and the energy and the entertainment value frankly of this rather potentially technical and arcane debate was terrific. %$* 13
it was a lot of fun and you made it really interesting. %$* 13
thank you for all of that. %$* 13
and to be honest, a lot of times, i have to reject questions, and i don't like doing it. %$* 13
i didn't have to do it tonight. %$* 13
the questions were great. %$* 13
i even liked the elevator ride you took downstairs. %$* 13
thank you for doing that, so to everybody who got up and asked a question, thank you to you as well. %$* 13
your applause was robust and spontaneous throughout the evening. %$* 13
it was very, very helpful to us. %$* 13
so a few things i want to tell you about, first of all, we're encouraging anybody here to tweet about the debate, of course. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us, @iq2us. the hash tag for tonight's debate is #strongdollar. %$* 13
our next debate in new york, our monthly debate, is on wednesday, april 17.the motion that night will be, "the gop must seize the center or die." steve, i'm just wondering if you had a reaction to that at all. %$* 13
arguing in support of the motion, david brookes, he's an op-ed columnist at the new york times, and mickey edwards, he's a former republican congressman from oklahoma. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, laura ingraham, host of the laura ingraham show, and ralph reed, chairman and founder of the faith and freedom coalition. %$* 13
in about three weeks, we're going on the road. %$* 13
we're going to be in washington, d.c.it's a special edition of intelligence squared. %$* 13
the motion that we'll be arguing on wednesday, april 3rd, is, "abolish the minimum wage." you can get details and tickets to this and our remaining spring debates at our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
the side arguing to abolish the minimum wage is jim dorn and russ roberts. %$* 13
arguing against, jared bernstein and karen kornbluh. %$* 13
for those who cannot join the live audience either here or in washington, there are a lot of other ways to catch these debates. %$* 13
you can watch the live stream as i'm sure a lot of people are now on fora.tv. %$* 13
thank you to all of you who are watching on fora. %$* 13
and you can listen to these debates, and this one in particular, on npr or watch it on pbs stations across the country. %$* 13
just check your local listings for air times-- %$* 13
air dates and times. %$* 13
one other thing i want to tell you that normally we announce the results which i'm about to do-- %$* 13
for the first time, we're going to crunch the numbers in a different way. %$* 13
we're curious to see just in terms of the open-mindedness, and flexibility, and willingness to listen of the audience-- %$* 13
i mean flexibility, not in that way, but in a willingness to listen to other ideas-- %$* 13
we kind of wanted to see how many of you actually did change your positions, and how many of you voted the same way twice, how many of you voted different ways. %$* 13
what we're going to do is in the-- %$* 13
it takes a little time for us to crunch that. %$* 13
it'll probably take about five minutes. %$* 13
so after i announce the debates and after we've concluded, if you watch-- %$* 13
stay and watch these screens, it'll come up in a couple of minutes, just that analysis, if you have some curiosity about that. %$* 13

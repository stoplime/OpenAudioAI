so, please, your first test in spontaneous applause, please welcome to the stage, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 1
so-- %$* 13
so this one has a lot of emotion to it. %$* 13
i don't know if you've seen it, but already on our website where we let people sort of vote in an opinion poll sort of way, we have thousands-- %$* 13
thousands of votes coming in today. %$* 13
why does this one get people so worked up? %$* 13
well, the debates we've had about food always seem to have that effect. %$* 1
we did one on-- %$* 1
on "don't eat anything with a face." we did one on “organic food is marketing hype.” and they've all engendered high emotion, because i think people, many people, look at the food they eat not just as a lifestyle choice or a health choice, but almost as an expression of who they are as people. %$* 1
so the emotions run really, really high when people identify that much with-- %$* 1
with their food choices. %$* 1
okay. %$* 13
so, we have the emotion. %$* 13
let's just look very briefly at the intellectual side of it. %$* 13
where can this argument-- %$* 13
these arguments take us? %$* 13
well, i think, to me, the intellectual arguments are sort of first order effects and second order effects. %$* 1
the first order effect of genetically modified food is that farmers can produce a lot more food a lot more efficiently, and that's particularly important for feeding people in the less developed world where hunger is a real issue. %$* 1
so that's a first order effect. %$* 1
but the second order effects, now that we've had 30 years of experience with this, could include things like-- %$* 1
like super weeds or-- %$* 1
or plant species that-- %$* 1
that get immune to pesticides and therefore require more and more of them. %$* 1
so, i think it's going to be-- %$* 1
the intellectual side of this is going to be a debate between first and second order effects. %$* 1
and a little bit just on the fact that as a debate, we're going through this tight exercise of arguing on this motion, but it means we want to be specific about what we and what the debaters think this motion means, "genetically modify food." %$* 13
so, i think what we're talking about is genetic modifications that will never occur in nature, that require human intervention to-- %$* 1
to bring about. %$* 1
and we're talking about plants and not animals. %$* 1
i think that's the definition of tonight's debate. %$* 1
well, i know that all four of these debaters care very passionately about this topic, as does, obviously, a lot of the audience. %$* 13
so let's welcome them to the stage. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
thank you, bob. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
okay, we're letting everybody get settled in. %$* 13
i just wanted to mention, when i talked about asking questions of the audience, that i can't ask questions of people who are upstairs. %$* 13
so when that time comes, you may want to come downstairs, and i'll make an effort if i know that you've made the effort, to try and call on you if i can. %$* 13
and i just want to launch this now, please, with one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for doing all of this. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
this is intelligence squared u.s.and nature has many unknowns, but one certainty is that tomatoes and fish do not have sex with each other. %$* 13
they never have. %$* 13
and yet, one of the most famous, or some might say, infamous feats of genetic engineering was the development of a tomato whose dna was mingled with dna from a fish, which gave it a longer life on the vine, and it worked. %$* 13
then there's corn, where today some 90 percent of the corn grown in the united states has its dna mixed with dna that comes from a bacterium so that it will stand up better to pests, and that works. %$* 13
and is this a good thing, this genetic engineering, that nature could never accomplish on its own? %$* 13
is it a safe thing? %$* 13
is it necessary? %$* 13
well, those questions sound like the makings of a debate, so let's have it: "yes" or "no" to this statement, "genetically modify food," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion, "genetically modify food." as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then the live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is "genetically modify food." let's meet the team first arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please let's welcome robert fraley. %$* 13
and, robb, you are executive vice president and chief technology officer at monsanto. %$* 13
you've worked there 30 years. %$* 13
you are the winner of the world food prize laureate. %$* 13
that's an award often described as the "nobel for food and agriculture." and it's related to this debate because of your work on what exactly? %$* 13
well, thanks, john. %$* 56
yeah, that was a reward given along with two of my academic colleagues for basically developing the tools that have allowed us to create the gmo crops. %$* 56
there at the beginning. %$* 13
yep. %$* 56
robert fraley, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and i'm joined tonight by my partner, alison van eenennaam, who is going to talk about the technology as well and the benefits. %$* 56
ladies and gentlemen, alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
alison, you are also arguing for the motion, "genetically modify food." you are a specialist in animal science at uc davis. %$* 13
you said that you chose to study agricultural science when you were still in high school but that it wasn't an obvious choice for you. %$* 13
how come? %$* 13
well, i'm an urban girl, i was born in the city in australia, and i'm kind of a science nerd, still am actually, and i was interested in how we might use science to improve the productivity of agriculture. %$* 57
and it's what i've spent my career pursuing. %$* 57
thank you, alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
that's the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
we have two debaters arguing against the motion, "genetically modify food." let's please first welcome chuck benbrook. %$* 13
chuck, you are at washington state. %$* 13
you are known for your research on pesticide use in particular. %$* 13
you've debated with us before actually. %$* 13
you were a proponent of organic food, and you won overwhelmingly, very decisively. %$* 13
so, are you feeling lucky again tonight? %$* 13
i am, john. %$* 58
we've-- %$* 58
we're well prepared, mardi and i, and since we have the facts and science on our side i think we'll be fine. %$* 58
and tell us, please, who is this mardi of which you speak? %$* 13
my partner-- %$* 58
hello. %$* 59
margaret or mardi mellon, is going to help me make the case. %$* 58
ladies and gentlemen, mardi, margaret mellon. %$* 13
mardi mellon, 18 years you are with the union of concerned scientists. %$* 13
interestingly, while a scientist you are also a lawyer. %$* 13
you are also the only debater onstage tonight with a last name, mellon, that sounds like an actual edible product. %$* 13
yes. %$* 59
coincidence? %$* 13
well, i don't think so. %$* 59
but my last name also sounds like a bank and-- %$* 59
money is probably as important as food in this debate. %$* 59
very clever. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, margaret mellon. %$* 13
and that's our team arguing against the motion, which is "genetically modify food." i want to say this, i'm hearing hissing. %$* 13
i don't want to hear it, please. %$* 13
and if we hear it, i would appreciate the audience silence the hisser with a round of civil applause because it's just not the way we want to go with it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, this is-- %$* 13
now i'm going to get all light again-- %$* 13
this is a debate. %$* 13
and in that sense it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a contest of ideas and logic and argumentation and wit. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here, acts as the judges in that debate. %$* 13
we have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate, on your views on the motion. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most from the beginning to the end will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, again, look at the motion, "genetically modify food," if you agree with this motion as you come in off the street push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided push number three. %$* 13
if you push the wrong button just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote, and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
we're going to lock it out. %$* 13
so, just remember again how you voted this time, and listen to the arguments, and we'll see how you vote the next time. %$* 13
and then, again, the team with the difference in percentage point terms-- %$* 13
the greatest difference-- %$* 13
will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is this: genetically modify food. %$* 13
we go in three rounds. %$* 13
and let's go on to round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
here to argue for the motion, please welcome robert fraley. %$* 13
he is executive vice president and chief technology officer at monsanto. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, robert fraley. %$* 13
john, thanks. %$* 56
and i really appreciate the opportunity to be here. %$* 56
this subject is very important to me. %$* 56
it's really been my life. %$* 56
it started-- %$* 56
i grew up on a-- %$* 56
on a family farm in the central part of the united states. %$* 56
i was one of those-- %$* 56
i wouldn't have thought of myself as a nerd, but i was one of those kids who always knew he wanted to be a scientist. %$* 56
and i had the-- %$* 56
i had the unique privilege, after getting my doctorate degree, to attend the university of california at san francisco, which was kind of the epicenter where gmo research started. %$* 56
and even back then, it was pretty clear that gmo technology would have a profound implication in health care. %$* 56
and just as a quick test of the audience-- %$* 56
how many of you know anybody who's a diabetic and takes insulin? %$* 56
so, a lot of hands. %$* 56
so, actually, insulin was the first gmo product. %$* 56
and now, you know, that's the typical treatment. %$* 56
and it's a safer, better product. %$* 56
today, in health care, just to give you a sense of the transformation, six of the top-selling drugs in the united states are based on gmo technology. %$* 56
so, tremendous progress. %$* 56
let me-- %$* 56
let me make it a little more food related. %$* 56
how many of you eat cheese? %$* 56
all right. %$* 56
the first actual gmo product ever approved for food use was a product called rennet. %$* 56
rennet is the enzyme that's actually used to make cheese. %$* 56
and today, 90 percent of our cheeses are based on gmos, using a safer approach and a more effective way of making the technology. %$* 56
so, as i said in the introduction, you know, i helped develop the first gmo plants back in the-- %$* 56
in the early 1980s. %$* 56
and then we took about another 15 years of additional studies and development before the first commercial products were launched in the-- %$* 56
in the mid 1990s. %$* 56
and those were products that helped farmers protect against insects and protect against weeds. %$* 56
so, for insect protection, we actually use the very same bt protein that is used by organic farmers for years, and built that into the plants to protect them from insects. %$* 56
and as a result of that, we saw dramatic reduction in insecticide use and an increase in-- %$* 56
in crop yields. %$* 56
and the herbicide tolerant crops, and herbicide tolerant crops have been a great enabler. %$* 56
they've enabled farmers to use safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals and replace the products that were previously used, but they've also had a profound benefit to the environment, of enabling farmers to not plow their soils. %$* 56
and as a result, use less energy, release less carbon, and-- %$* 56
and reduce erosion, which have been key. %$* 56
today, if you look around the world, gmo crops are grown in about 27 countries. %$* 56
they're being used by 18 million – farmers. %$* 56
and to put it in perspective, this has been the most rapidly-adopted technology in the history of agriculture. %$* 56
and that's because the benefits have been so real and so clear. %$* 56
as i said, it's reduced pesticide use. %$* 56
it's helped farmers to produce more food and bring it, you know, from their harvest into-- %$* 56
into the-- %$* 56
into the-- %$* 56
into consumption. %$* 56
it's preserved our soils. %$* 56
it's reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a lot of benefits. %$* 56
now, you're going to hear different perspectives tonight on the technology. %$* 56
but here's a simple logic test. %$* 56
as i said, i grew up on a farm. %$* 56
i've watched my dad make those decisions on which seeds to buy, which equipment to use, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 56
i can tell you that there's no farmer who would plant gmo crops if they didn't have a real benefit. %$* 56
and they certainly wouldn't have planted them for the last 20 years if they didn't have real value. %$* 56
so, the impact of gmos has been amazing, and lots of applications across companies and universities. %$* 56
and my partner, dr. %$* 56
alison van eenennaam, is going to describe a lot of those applications that are still being developed. %$* 56
i'd like to step back and say, as a scientist and a father, the safety of these products is-- %$* 56
is absolutely on the-- %$* 56
on the top of my mind. %$* 56
and what i'm most proud about is the fact that these technologies have been in the marketplace for over 20 years, and there's not been a single, not one issue of food or feed safety ever associated with the technology. %$* 56
and i'd make this point, that there's a strong scientific consensus on the safety of gmos, as i-- %$* 56
as there is on the role of greenhouse gases and climate change, so that's-- %$* 56
that's very important. %$* 56
the last area i'd like to highlight is that the safety actually starts with the fact that mankind has been genetically modifying and selecting crops from the beginning of time. %$* 56
and whether you're looking at modern-day corn or tomatoes, or you're looking at peaches or soybeans, we've been moving genes around from the-- %$* 56
from the beginning of time. %$* 56
but through biotechnology, we're able to do it even more precisely, literally one gene at a time, and that's key. %$* 56
also, this technology is highly regulated. %$* 56
it's regulated by the government agencies in the u.s.but it's important to realize that we export grains to 40 countries around the world who have all researched and approved these products. %$* 56
alison's going to talk about some of the safety studies. %$* 56
bottom line from those studies is these are the most thoroughly studied foods in our food supply, and they are absolutely safe. %$* 56
now, let me make a couple of quick points as a scientist who's been involved in this his-- %$* 56
his whole career. %$* 56
first of all, gmos are not the holy grail. %$* 56
what they are is an important tool, if used properly, can have a huge impact in bringing remarkable new products to farmers and benefit consumers for a long time. %$* 56
second, gmos aren't the only tool we need. %$* 56
we need to continue to invest in plant breeding, we need to continue to invest in new areas like precision agriculture. %$* 56
we need to invest in organic farming techniques and other tools. %$* 56
and finally, let me just say, gmos, are they perfect? %$* 56
absolutely not. %$* 56
you know, they need to be regulated, they need to be managed wisely, like-- %$* 56
like any technology. %$* 56
and, for example, we know that insects can become resistant to gmo crops just like they can to other insecticides. %$* 56
we know that-- %$* 56
that weeds can evolve resistance, whether, you know, to herbicides, whether those are herbicides used in gmo crops or other systems. %$* 56
but i also know that-- %$* 56
and i acknowledge that these are legitimate concerns, but i also know that the science can make a huge impact to manage these technologies. %$* 56
so-- %$* 56
and this is so key as we-- %$* 56
as we think about the future, because we are on the brink of facing one of mankind's greatest challenges. %$* 56
global population continues to grow. %$* 56
it's going to reach 9.5 billion by 2050.another 2 or 3 billion people will join the middle class. %$* 56
the demand for food will double by 2050.and so the decisions we make and the votes that you make tonight are really important. %$* 56
we will need to produce more food in the next 36 years than we have in the entire history of the world. %$* 56
so, it's a daunting challenge, and we're going to have to do that in the face of climate change and water shortage as we go forward. %$* 56
but i want to be clear, and i want to leave you with this optimistic note as i summarize. %$* 56
we can do this, but it means working together, and it means-- %$* 56
finding a common ground. %$* 56
and using all of our tools so-- %$* 56
thank you. %$* 56
robert fraley, i'm sorry-- %$* 13
finding a common ground. %$* 56
i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
and using all of our tools so-- %$* 56
i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 56
robert fraley. %$* 13
our motion, "genetically modify food." and here to speak against this motion, margaret mellon. %$* 13
she is a science policy consultant and former founding director of the union of concerned scientists food and environment program. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, margaret mellon. %$* 13
thank you very much, and thanks to robb. %$* 59
he made a number of points that i think we're going to come back to over the-- %$* 59
over the course of the debate. %$* 59
but i want to focus my remarks, really, on just one point, and that is whether or not genetically modified or genetically engineered-- %$* 59
i'm going to use those two words interchangeably-- %$* 59
whether those technologies are essential or even an important technologies for meeting the challenge of feeding 9 billion people without destroying the earth. %$* 59
and that means raising our productivity but without dead zones in the gulf of mexico, without a lake erie or that has-- %$* 59
you know, in some parts of the year is now just a toxic algal soup. %$* 59
it's a huge challenge. %$* 59
now, i'm going to argue against that. %$* 59
but i understand why a lot of people believe that genetic engineering is the answer. %$* 59
and i think a lot of that has to do with the way the technology debuted. %$* 59
i mean, i was there in the early days when monsanto came up with its products. %$* 59
i was working in washington, d.c.for the environmental community. %$* 59
the place was abuzz with the idea that a new molecular technology was on the way that would convert agriculture into an environmentally benign activity. %$* 59
i was at the wildlife-- %$* 59
at the national wildlife federation when monsanto folks came and said, “you people in the environmental community ought to be the first to embrace this technology because it's going to reduce pesticide use." i wanted to learn more, and i did when i went to monsanto and got the tour out in st. %$* 59
louis. %$* 59
and i was told, it's not only going to reduce toxic use of chemist-- %$* 59
of chemicals, it's going to produce crops that can fertilize themselves. %$* 59
it's going to produce crops that are high yielding, that'll make famine a thing of the past, that are re-- %$* 59
resistant to stress, to cold, to drought, to heat. %$* 59
it was a-- %$* 59
it was a really compelling and-- %$* 59
and a vision i was really taken by. %$* 59
my big question was that it was a brand-new technology using very new techniques, and would it work? %$* 59
well, we have had now 30 years to find out whether it's going to work, billions of dollars in investment in it. %$* 59
and i think there's just no doubt that compared to the vision, the early vision, it's a big disappointment. %$* 59
now, after 30 years, there are no crops out there that fertilize themselves. %$* 59
there's one drought-tolerant crop that's drought tolerant because of genetic engineering. %$* 59
there are no crops whose yields are the result of genetic engineering apart from making them better able to deal with pests. %$* 59
you know, there are no genetically engineered crops that resist water logging. %$* 59
i mean, you name it. %$* 59
it really hasn't happened, with one exception, which we've heard about, which is in the area of pest management, genetic engineering has been wildly successful. %$* 59
i mean, people have adopted it all over the world. %$* 59
and-- %$* 59
and that's because in the early days, the technology did deliver. %$* 59
it made it possible-- %$* 59
people that use roundup-ready crops and bt crops in the early days, their pesticide use went down. %$* 59
that's why their costs down, that's why their farms were easier to manage, even as they got bigger. %$* 59
and farmers-- %$* 59
you know, farmers were really happy about that. %$* 59
but, you know, as one farmer has said, not too recently, the days of-- %$* 59
i mean, we've run through the best herbicide that the-- %$* 59
that the world had to offer. %$* 59
glyphosate is no longer as useful as it once was, and it's getting less useful every day because resistant weeds are coming, and those resistant weeds are leading to more-- %$* 59
those resistant weeds are leading to greater and greater use of herbicides. %$* 59
and we are now at a point where, i mean, if you look forward, i'm going to let my colleague, dr. %$* 59
benbrook talk about this more, but there is, you know, nothing ahead of us except skyrocketing use, not only of glyphosate, which is the major herbicide in roundup, but of other herbicides-- %$* 59
2,4-d, dicamba-- %$* 59
herbicides we thought we'd never have to use much of-- %$* 59
much of again. %$* 59
so, i guess to answer-- %$* 59
what i want-- %$* 59
i do want to say that we-- %$* 59
we now know why. %$* 59
i mean, genetically engineered-- %$* 59
it turns out to be a lot harder to do genetic engineering than i think anybody thought in the early days. %$* 59
and it's especially hard when you're dealing with complex traits that involve a number of genes. %$* 59
that's why yield and stress resistance have proven to be so difficult. %$* 59
but these pesticide technologies have involved really only the transfer of a single gene, and they-- %$* 59
you know, they have worked in the case of the two products we've talked about. %$* 59
but, you know, to answer my first question, a technology that, after 30 years, has not delivered, you know, on the full-- %$* 59
on the full range of products that it kind of promised to the public early on, and in the one application where it has delivered, the benefits of the technology are now being reversed, and we are going in the direction of increased herbicide use. %$* 59
i mean, that is not a technology that is either essential or i would argue even important to addressing the major agricultural challenges ahead of us. %$* 59
fortunately, we've got other technologies out there. %$* 59
they're far more powerful than genetic engineering. %$* 59
they’re traditional breeding and agro economy-- %$* 59
ecology we're going to talk about them later. %$* 59
but before we can talk about them, we need to be clear about what genetic engineering can't do. %$* 59
and we don't want to ban it, we don't want to abandon research on it, but we do kind of want to move it off to the side of the-- %$* 59
of the stage. %$* 59
and in order to do that, you have to rebalance the debate. %$* 59
you have to kind of take the rose colored glasses off and you can start that process right here, right tonight, by voting "no" on "genetically modify food." %$* 59
thank you, margaret mellon. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "genetically modify food." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
here to debate for the motion, alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
she is a genomics and biotechnology researcher and cooperative extension specialist in the department of animal science at uc davis. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
wow, it's a great turnout here tonight, it’s not my usual audience. %$* 57
i spend a lot of my time talking to farmers and ranchers. %$* 57
and it's my pleasure to be here speaking to you tonight. %$* 57
i'd like to start with a premise that i hope we can all agree on, and that is in the future more people are going to need to be fed better with less environmental impact. %$* 57
and as a public sector scientist, my interest is finding real-world solutions to that problem. %$* 57
and to me gm food offers one of those solutions. %$* 57
it's derived from crops produced using a breeding method based on the movement of useful genes from one species into another. %$* 57
tonight i'll spend some time discussing the impressive safety record of gm crops, how they've provided well-documented benefits, and how gm is sometimes uniquely able to deliver a useful trait like crops that are more resilient to climate change. %$* 57
and i will contend that the benefits of gm are too great to vote anything but "yes" for gm tonight. %$* 57
gmo technology often gets conflated with monsanto and big ag, but it's actually a breeding tool, one that can be used for many purposes. %$* 57
in my own research, in selection for disease resistant cattle, i use many breeding methods, including classical selection for healthy animals and, more recently, the use of dna markers to assist in selecting for disease resistant genes. %$* 57
as a geneticist i can envision how combining gm with these other breeding methods, because they are not mutually exclusive, could accelerate the progress of my publicly funded research program by enabling me to use gm to directly protect cattle from infection. %$* 57
this would be associated with reduced illness and the decreased use of antibiotics, something i think is perhaps a common shared value amongst this group. %$* 57
as robb mentioned, most commercialized gmo crops today have been made to resist insects and herbicides and have been adopted by 18 million farmers globally, but importantly 16.5 million of those farmers are in the developing world, both men and women, some of whom farm areas smaller than the size of the auditorium tonight. %$* 57
what have been the impacts of this widespread adoption? %$* 57
as a scientist i go to the independent, peer-reviewed literature to answer such questions, especially reviews and meta-analyses that present a summary of many independent studies. %$* 57
it's like a well- informed referee presenting an objective assessment of the state of play. %$* 57
recently, german university professors published a comprehensive analysis of 147 separate studies that assess the impact of gm crops. %$* 57
they found that the benefits were significant not only in the u.s.but more importantly in the developing world. %$* 57
on average, gm technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent, increased yields by 22 percent, and increased farmer profits by 68 percent. %$* 57
the yield gains are due to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage. %$* 57
and the benefits have been largest for smallholder farmers in developing countries who have dramatically reduced their insecticide applications as a result of gm crops. %$* 57
this has benefitted both farmer health and also the environment and beneficial insects. %$* 57
now researchers throughout the public and private sector are using this breeding tool to deliver other benefits to society. %$* 57
researchers at hawaii and cornell university have used it to produce a virus resistant papaya, a product which has literally saved the hawaiian papaya industry. %$* 57
other introductions include drought resistant corn, virus resistant squash, consumer traits like a non-browning apple, a low-acrylamide potato, and crops that produce oils improved for nutrition. %$* 57
none of these applications require the use of any chemical pesticides, an issue that often gets conflated with this technology. %$* 57
university researchers are working to develop gm oranges that are resistant to citrus greening disease, something that is devastating the florida orange industry. %$* 57
and here in new york, researchers are using a wheat gene to develop gm american chestnut trees resistant to the imported chestnut blight. %$* 57
if approved, these trees will be distributed to the public in a not for profit program to restore the american chestnut tree to the eastern forests. %$* 57
plant diseases annually destroy some 15 percent of our world's agricultural harvest, a number that is likely to grow as our climate changes. %$* 57
there are many publicly funded groups around the world, working to develop gm- disease resistant varieties of crops, including apples, bananas, cassava, cowpea, eggplant, grapes, potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, and wheat. %$* 57
some of these staple crops are an essential source of nutrient in the diets of the poor. %$* 57
and it doesn't stop at plants. %$* 57
researchers at cuny are working with an international consortium to develop genetically-engineered cattle that are resistant to african sleeping sickness, a disease that kills several thousand people and three million cattle annually. %$* 57
this project is being publicly funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation, and the u.s.national science foundation. %$* 57
all of these gm applications focus on controlling disease with genetics rather than chemicals, an objective that i would argue is compatible with agroecology, sustainability, and feeding more people better with less environmental impact. %$* 57
there are literally dozens of other applications and field trials globally. %$* 57
nitrogen-efficient and flood-tolerant rice. %$* 57
drought-tolerant wheat. %$* 57
and biocassava plus, a private-public partnership that will use gm to increase the nutrient levels, shelf life, and disease resistance of cassava, a major source of carbohydrates in parts of the world. %$* 57
improved cassava harvests could increase the incomes of african households, helping lift poor farmers-- %$* 57
many of them women-- %$* 57
out of poverty. %$* 57
i could go on, but none of this would be possible without the broad scientific consensus about the safety of gm and solidated and support that consensus. %$* 57
a 2013 review article, written by independent italian public sector scientists, reviewed over 1,700 scientific records on ge crop safety published this past decade, and concluded that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of ge crops. %$* 57
my own 2014 review paper examined both well- designed animal feeding studies and the field performance and health trends of the over 100 billion food producing animals that have been consuming gm feed over the last decade, and found no credible evidence of harm. %$* 57
the american association for the advancement of science, the world's largest and most prestigious scientific society, stated in 2012 that science is quite clear: crop improvement by modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe. %$* 57
they're joined by the world health organization, the american medical association, the u.s.national academy of sciences, the british royal society, and every major regulatory agency in the world. %$* 57
given the realized benefits, the potential of this science, and the documented safety record, i urge you to allow breeders to use this valuable method to improve crops and vote yes for tonight's motion. %$* 57
thank you alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
and the motion is, genetically modify food. %$* 13
and here is our final debater to speak against the motion, chuck benbrook. %$* 13
he is a research professor at the center for sustaining agriculture and natural resources at washington state university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, chuck benbrook. %$* 13
thanks, folks, and thanks to intelligence squared for having me back. %$* 58
i figured i used up my welcome last time, but glad to be back again. %$* 58
well, i guess the reason we're having a debate is perhaps there isn't complete agreement on some of the things that we've been discussing already. %$* 58
in fact, you know, robb and alison, if all of what you said was true, i would be over there at your side of the table, going at it with-- %$* 58
with poor mardi all by herself. %$* 58
i do think it's time for sort of a national fireside chat about the applications of agricultural biotechnology in food production. %$* 58
and i'm actually glad it's happening. %$* 58
we've had a number of highly contested state level ballot initiatives on labeling of ge food. %$* 58
and as a result, the awareness and consciousness of people around the country is going up. %$* 58
and that's a good thing. %$* 58
the-- %$* 58
there's tough choices for our society about whether we want to go down this road of more intensive, specialized input intensive agriculture, kind of with genetic engineering leading the train, or whether we want to steer agriculture in some other directions. %$* 58
so, a couple of things i ask of the audience, as you listen to the back and forth tonight. %$* 58
and there'll be-- %$* 58
there'll be a lot of it. %$* 58
i ask you to vote on the reality of what genetically engineered crops, the ones that are on the market today, have actually brought about, and not just how well they work for the first three or four years. %$* 58
and i think, you know, the record is very clear, they were rapidly adopted. %$* 58
they worked very well. %$* 58
they were spectacularly effective in particularly the roundup ready crops. %$* 58
and these are the so-called herbicide tolerant crops, which made it easy for farmers to control weeds in corn, soybeans, and cotton. %$* 58
those were the three big crops. %$* 58
we'll mostly talk about those tonight. %$* 58
so, don't-- %$* 58
you know, don't base this on the promise and the aspirations of the biotechnology industry and the things that the biotech industry thinks that at some point the science will deliver, things like corn plants that fix their own nitrogen or drought tolerant crops or nutritionally enhanced crops. %$* 58
some of these things may eventually be achieved, but they haven't yet. %$* 58
and i ask you to think about the-- %$* 58
what's the reality of genetic engineering agriculture today as opposed to the promise or the aspiration. %$* 58
i also suggest and ask you to think about the impacts of genetically engineered crops as a package. %$* 58
it's not just the genes that robb fraley and his colleagues at monsanto were able to work into the corn plant, but you have to think about how that corn plant behaves in the field, the yields, what the impacts of the bt proteins that are all throughout that plant are on the environment, on aquatic ecosystems, on the cost to farmers. %$* 58
and, of course, in the case of the herbicide tolerant crops, the great concern is this huge increase in herbicide use that's started about a decade ago and has gotten worse and worse and worse each year. %$* 58
and now the-- %$* 58
the industry and the government has just approved the next generation of herbicide-tolerant crops that are now engineered to tolerate two of the riskiest old herbicides that have been in use for a long time. %$* 58
you'll hear the word "2,4-d" and "dicamba." this is definitely not a step in the right direction. %$* 58
so, we have to think about the totality of the impacts, including we have put so much energy as a country, and the industry has put most of its plant-breeding effort or eggs in the ge basket for these herbicide tolerant crops and bt crops. %$* 58
and there's a lot of other priorities that plant breeders have not focused on as seriously as they should have. %$* 58
and that is a cost of the technology. %$* 58
we're going to talk a lot about safety today. %$* 58
rest assured there is no consensus about the safety of ge foods, and there are a number of reasons to be more concerned in 2014 than we were in 1996, the year that they were introduced, or in 2000, which was about the time the adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans was very high. %$* 58
and, really, with each passing year, as more and more ge plants are grown, as more herbicides are required to bring them to harvest, the list of both health concerns and environmental concerns is growing. %$* 58
and i'm sure we'll get back to them. %$* 58
there was a national geographic, wonderful national geographic series about the future of food the last year. %$* 58
and perhaps many of you read at least some of them. %$* 58
in the may 2014 issue of national geographic, there was kind of a capstone piece that sort of presented a plan forward-- %$* 58
to meet the needs of 9 billion people on an earth with shrinking resources. %$* 58
and this guy, jonathan foley, an academic from the university of minnesota, he wrote a piece, "a five-step plan to feed the world." it's really a great piece. %$* 58
it's short. %$* 58
so, here's where his five steps, and i quote exactly how he states them. %$* 58
"freeze agriculture's footprint." and by this, in his discussion, he's talking about, let's not clear any more tropical rainforests. %$* 58
let's leave most of the wild lands wild. %$* 58
second, "grow more on the farms that we have." and this is absolutely right on. %$* 58
i mean, you know, in-- %$* 58
in the developed world, farmers, you know, harvest 150 to 250 bushels of corn, in africa, you know, 40 to 60. %$* 58
so, there's great potential around the world to raise the yields on the-- %$* 58
on farms that really have worn out soils, don't have access to a lot of input. %$* 58
so growing more on the farms we have is clearly a critical part of the solution. %$* 58
his-- %$* 58
foley's third way to help feed the world, it was, "use resources more efficiently." this is kind of a no-brainer. %$* 58
it's-- %$* 58
it's something that obviously most of the agricultural inputs that today's corn, soybean and cotton farmers use are petroleum based. %$* 58
as the price of energy goes up, their prices is going to go up. %$* 58
and perhaps their availability will come into question. %$* 58
so, obviously we have to use petroleum-based inputs more efficiently and water more efficiently. %$* 58
the fourth, a very important one: "shift diets." us americans, people in europe, we-- %$* 58
we eat very high on the hog. %$* 58
we eat a lot of meat, and it takes a lot of food calories to produce a single calorie of beef, about 100 to 1. %$* 58
thank you. %$* 58
well, good. %$* 58
chuck benbrook, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 58
thank you very much. %$* 13
well, good. %$* 58
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "genetically modify food." so, keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening. %$* 13
i'll remind you one more time that you'll be asked to vote a second time after you've heard all of the arguments. %$* 13
and the teams whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you at our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
our motion is this: "genetically modify food". the team arguing for the motion, robert fraley and alison van eenennaam, have argued that genetic engineering of food is no holy grail, but that it is a tool that can be used to help an enormous number of people. %$* 13
they say the proof of this is the fact that farmers have been using it because, in fact, it works for them. %$* 13
she says their safety has been established over 20 years without a single known injury related to the consumption of genetically engineered food, that the studies are a waterfall of support for this argument and also for the benefits themselves of genetically engineered food. %$* 13
and they talk about the possibilities in the future of plants that can crush, absolutely crush plant disease and survive, which would be better for all. %$* 13
it's a lot of promise about the future. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, margaret mellon and chuck benbrook, they're saying, don't look at the future. %$* 13
look at the present. %$* 13
and their argument is that so far, genetically engineered food has not lived up to its promise. %$* 13
it's pulled off a couple of very neat and important tricks, but not all that was promised in the beginning. %$* 13
they say that they're not necessary, that they are not proven safe and that in fact contrary to the other side's assertions that there is no consensus on their safety. %$* 13
i want to go first to the safety question and take the argument back to chuck benbrook who just completed your opening statements. %$* 13
chuck, you said that there is no consensus on this. %$* 13
your opponents have actually framed the statement that there's no scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified food as being akin to people challenging the science behind global warming, that-- %$* 13
that you have-- %$* 13
they didn't literally say this, but you have to be a little bit of a crank not to-- %$* 13
not to buy the science. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
i've read essentially all the statements by various bodies. %$* 58
and here's what they essentially all say. %$* 58
they use slightly different words. %$* 58
they say the genetic engineering of food as a technology does not create any new or different potential risks in the modified foods that other forms of plant breeding don't. %$* 58
several of the reports, including both of the two national academy of sciences reports that specifically address this say that there is a possibility that genetically engineered foods may pose higher risk of that nature, but we really don't know. %$* 58
they also all say that there's no convincing evidence now or at this point that there's been acute health problems in the u.s.population from the consumption of genetically engineered foods. %$* 58
and then they all go on to call for further investment in the development of more sensitive, scientific techniques to assess the possibile risks, and they also call for post approval surveillance. %$* 58
most of the recommendations for better science, more careful risk assessment and post market surveillance that have been made for over 15 years, in these reports have not been acted upon-- %$* 58
all right, let's-- %$* 13
in the u.s. %$* 58
let's let your opponent, robert fraley respond. %$* 13
so, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what i said earlier, but, you know, this science is-- %$* 56
has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to health and agriculture with an impressive safety record. %$* 56
i mean, not a single issue of animal or human safety with the technology. %$* 56
that's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, i just want to illustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been. %$* 56
chuck and i first met when we put in place the usda epa and fda oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world. %$* 56
but every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world. %$* 56
all right, let me stop you for a second. %$* 13
these products are safe. %$* 56
i just want to ask margaret mellon, do you concede that point, or do you refute it? %$* 13
no, i do not concede it. %$* 59
so what-- %$* 13
what's wrong about his facts then? %$* 13
well, i think that there is agreement that there is no evidence that the current applications of genetic engineering have dramatic acute short term-- %$* 59

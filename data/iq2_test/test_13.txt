and it's become canon that i think that it is not-- %$* 43
it's a nice metaphor, but it's actually a wrong metaphor. %$* 43
the idea is, it's a pyramid, right? %$* 43
many of you have seen this. %$* 43
businesses put up, like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere. %$* 43
data information knowledge, wisdom. %$* 43
it's a pyramid because the idea is that knowledge is a matter-- %$* 43
we think knowledge is a matter of filtering out information. %$* 43
so we start with broad-based data. %$* 43
that gets filtered out. %$* 43
what's worthy information is-- %$* 43
in data becomes information and so on up the path. %$* 43
and certainly wisdom does not work that way. %$* 43
wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment. %$* 43
and i also don't think knowledge works that way either. %$* 43
knowledge is not a filtering of information. %$* 43
in fact, let me-- %$* 43
the information itself is very suspect. %$* 43
take it to your opponent that he actually refutes-- %$* 13
he refutes the assertion that knowledge and information are different, which is-- %$* 13
on which your argument hinges. %$* 13
but just having a bunch of stuff is not such a great advantage. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb i fundamentally disagree that the concepts of information, knowledge and wisdom are mere metaphors that were invented in the 1990s. %$* 40
that's insane. %$* 40
this is-- %$* 40
but this is fundamental to our understanding of what it means to be a thoughtful, you know, intelligent person, is the ability to gather lots of information, to be aware of things going on. %$* 40
but then the crucial part is stepping back from the flow, taking that information and creating personal knowledge in your own mind. %$* 40
so there is a fundamental distinction between grabbing stuff online, between checking your twitter feed or your facebook notifications, and actually raising that up through connections, through contacts, through cultural knowledge. %$* 40
you do not dispute your opponent's, nick, that there is, at minimum, a whole lot more information available to individuals than there used to be. %$* 13
absolutely, there's a whole lot more information. %$* 40
the question is whether it's meaningful. %$* 13
the question is, how do we think? %$* 40
david weinberger. %$* 13
again, so it would be insane to say that we invented knowledge in the 1990s, somewhere the diagram in which we think that this is how the filtration process works i think is fundamentally misleading, that knowledge is not a filtering of information. %$* 43
it's a social process-- %$* 43
sorry, the epistemological chaos that-- %$* 43
it is somewhat chaotic. %$* 43
it's a social process in which we engage with one another. %$* 43
we-- %$* 43
knowledge is based in large part upon social-- %$* 43
relationships and makes social relationships. %$* 43
the computer based model of the brain that you and most of our culture accepts i think is highly suspect. %$* 43
and if we look past going-- %$* 43
you know, scanning down your facebook feed to see what's new and think about the times in which we actually do form knowledge, this new ecosystem, which i totally agree with you, we now have, is in fact spectacularly good for the formation of knowledge. %$* 43
smart technology is making us dumb let's bring in andrew carr do you want to respond to any of that? %$* 13
well, i don't even like this word, "information." i would prefer to use the word, "data." %$* 41
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i mispronounced your name. %$* 13
it's keen. %$* 13
keen, okay. %$* 41
yeah, because i've got the team of keen and carr. %$* 13
that's a lot of data or information. %$* 41
yeah. %$* 13
it's-- %$* 13
the alliteration just throws me. %$* 13
yeah, i'm always known as andrew carr on wikipedia. %$* 41
i think that what we have in our age of the smart machine, of smart technology is an avalanche of data. %$* 41
and i tend to think that we even have to distinguish data from information. %$* 41
and i certainly-- %$* 41
you know, i bow down to nick in this area from a scientific and an epistemological point of view. %$* 41
but this overpowering nature of data is troubling in all sorts of ways. %$* 41
and perhaps most troubling of all-- %$* 41
nick pointed to this-- %$* 41
was while we're all drowning in data, most of it extremely irrelevant at best-- %$* 41
inane, vulgar-- %$* 41
a tiny handful of silicon valley companies, most notably google and facebook, are making fortunes out of that data, not because it's correct, not because it has any value to civilization, not because it's solving problems in africa, but because they're selling advertising around it. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumbso there is a double vulgarity here, and i would much rather talk about a big data economy than an information economy. %$* 41
let me bring it to genevieve bell. %$* 13
and your opponent just said that-- %$* 13
that we are drowning in data, which would appear to try to set on its heels your argument that the plethora of stuff that we now have is in itself a good thing, because it's too much. %$* 13
well, i mean, i would make the argument that some of that data has been extraordinary in what it has revealed. %$* 42
i mean, you know, let's think about snowden and chelsea manning. %$* 42
let's think about the sony leaks. %$* 42
i mean, you know, whether we can argue about the legality of those, but the data that they generated revealed things about the contours of the world writ large and the world writ small, and made clear all manner of things that we might want as citizens, as human beings, as women to argue about. %$* 42
but what's the-- %$* 13
but the data they generated was data about the incredible surveillance apparatus that is built around smart technology deployed by the government. %$* 40
oh indeed. %$* 42
oh indeed. %$* 42
we're not having a debate about the morality of surveillance. %$* 42
we are having a debate about whether smart technology makes us dumb. %$* 42
and i think, you know, the argument there is not about surveillance, but about, "does the prevalence of data always mean we are drowning? %$* 42
nick carr, david weinberger said that skimming is good, and he said we do it naturally. %$* 13
we go into libraries and we skim and we select very quickly, and so he-- %$* 13
a direct challenge to your argument that this-- %$* 13
that this distraction that you talked about that the internet represents is so problematic. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 13
we read in different ways, and they're all valuable. %$* 40
on way of reading is skimming. %$* 40
if you open a magazine or newspaper, you do a lot of skimming. %$* 40
but then, particularly when you have a book or a news-- %$* 40
printed newspaper or something in front of you, you also-- %$* 40
when something interests you, you move to a much deeper form of reading where you're not skimming. %$* 40
you're actually reading. %$* 40
you're going line by line. %$* 40
and what research into how people read when they're looking at their phones or their computer shows is that skimming becomes the default, the dominant form of reading. %$* 40
and, in fact, you-- %$* 40
if you look at the research, the researchers talk about the f pattern by which they mean that people-- %$* 40
when they-- %$* 40
when people read on a computer screen, they go across the first couple of lines of text all the way, and then their eyes drift down the margin a little bit. %$* 40
and then they go about halfway across the text, and then their eyes just drift down the rest of the margin, so it forms this f pattern. %$* 40
and then you click, and you go somewhere else. %$* 40
so skimming is fine in context. %$* 40
better and more important is actually reading deeply, whether it's fiction or nonfiction or anything. %$* 40
that's when you get deeply engaged. %$* 40
that's when you learn stuff, and that's the kind of reading that we're losing, thanks to our smart technologies. %$* 40
and the evidence that we're losing it is what? %$* 13
because your opponents were talking about an enormous amount of reading they were talking about, an ability actually to process, even if it's game of thrones, very complex plots, that, in fact, the mind isn't dying because the argument is-- %$* 13
i don't think we're arguing that the mind is dying. %$* 40
and, fortunately, we used to be-- %$* 40
you know, used to get involved in "war and peace.” and now we get involved in "game of thrones.” and that's all fine. %$* 40
and that's all good. %$* 40
the question is, on balance, is this making us dumber or smarter? %$* 40
and i think there is, at this point, a lot of research. %$* 40
there's a great study that came out of stanford, where the researchers got two groups of people. %$* 40
one group spends a lot of time online, a lot of time multi-tasking. %$* 40
one group didn't. %$* 40
they gave them six basic, fundamental tests of cognitive function. %$* 40
the heavy multi-taskers did worse on all six tests. %$* 40
and one of the most revealing tests was how well people are able to distinguish important information from trivia. %$* 40
and on that test, the heavy multi-taskers, heavy users of smart technology, did very poorly. %$* 40
smart technology is making us dumb and what the researchers theorized is that what happens is we train ourselves not to pay attention to what's important, but simply to pay attention to what's new. %$* 40
so, when your phone goes off, when it buzzes, whatever, it can be the most trivial thing in the world, but that's what grabs your-- %$* 40
okay. %$* 13
attention. %$* 40
but let me-- %$* 13
and we begin to lose that fundamental ability to even think about what we should be thinking about. %$* 40
okay. %$* 13
so, genevieve bell, you're approaching, as we know, as an anthropologist. %$* 13
and we want to come to that part of the discussion shortly. %$* 13
but the description that nicholas gives, from the sort of lab-- %$* 13
the bench science on this, do you find it concerning? %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
first of all, do you dispute it or concede it? %$* 13
and in either case, do you find it concerning? %$* 13
i'm not sure i'm willing to dispute it, but i'm willing to suggest that, you know, we're at a very-- %$* 42
it may not feel like it to many of us in this room-- %$* 42
nick obviously the exception, having only had a smartphone for six months. %$* 42
this technology is still relatively new. %$* 42
it doesn't always feel that way, but a lot of this technology has been in mainstream adoption in the united states for less than a decade. %$* 42
and i think, you know, one of the things that's very clear is that the first studies that were done about the impact of the internet on our sociality, on our personalities, have long since been eclipsed by i'm thinking about that sara kiesler did at cmu, some of the other pieces of work, where some of the earlier assessments we made about how technology would affect people have now been proven, when you have more data, to be very different. %$* 42
and then i think the second question is, i am also interested in what those studies look like beyond the united states, and about what it means to not keep reducing smart technology down to facebook, google, twitter, and a phone, when in fact, we know that the technologies that are in people's worlds that are smart are far beyond that. %$* 42
and the impact of those, i think, is much more complex. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 42
andrew keen? %$* 13
do you want to respond to that point? %$* 13
because again, you're more on the cultural topic, but i'm-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 41
interested to see how you would process that. %$* 13
i'm very suspicious of genevieve's sort of argument about the non-western world. %$* 41
we always hear this about these new technologies. %$* 41
we always hear, "well, this is going to change everything. %$* 41
this is going to empower aboriginal people. %$* 41
this is going to solve poverty. %$* 41
this is going to allow people to develop their economies.” and as we know, from the way in which they-- %$* 41
when it comes to politics, this technology was, as genevieve says, is empowering, is liberating. %$* 41
but look at the arab spring. %$* 41
the arab spring was embraced by the digital utopians, because it was supposedly throwing off autocracy. %$* 41
it was supposedly doing away with the totalitarianism in the middle east. %$* 41
but what we've seen after the collapse of the arab spring is more anarchy. %$* 41
and what we see with this technology is its failure to actually create coherent political movements because of the death of distance, because of this intimacy and personalization. %$* 41
we saw the same, indeed, with the occupy movement in the united states. %$* 41
it's like a firework. %$* 41
it explodes. %$* 41
and when you look up in the sky, it's wonderful for about 10 seconds. %$* 41
and then it goes away. %$* 41
there's no consequence. %$* 41
there's no depth. %$* 41
the very depth that nick talks about in epistemological terms is also missing in social and political terms. %$* 41
so i think we have to be extremely careful to say, "well, all this technology is going to change everything for the next 2 or 3 billion people who are about to experience this technology." %$* 41
i'm particularly wary and troubled by that. %$* 41
genevieve bell. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 13
well, as you full well know, andrew-- %$* 42
as am i.and i was very careful not to say that. %$* 42
i'm not talking about the liberation-- %$* 42
well, you did talk about aboriginals. %$* 41
i talked about aborigines. %$* 42
i didn't say it was liberating them. %$* 42
i said the technology was being used to do things that made people's communities function in ways that they liked. %$* 42
i was arguing that it wasn't making them dumb. %$* 42
i want to be really clear here, right? %$* 42
this is not a cyber-utopian argument. %$* 42
this is an argument that says there are things that technology can do that don't necessarily have to be about liberating everyone or changing everything for it not to be making us stupid. %$* 42
that it's completely possible to imagine a world in which people use technology to enhance their daily practices, to support traditional culture, to find ways to marry traditional culture and science that doesn't necessarily have to be-- %$* 42
what was your phrase? %$* 42
oh, liberating the next 3 billion people. %$* 42
david weinberger, i-- %$* 13
do you want to respond to that, andrew? %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
not like he might want to. %$* 18
i've never wanted to respond to anything, but you're %$* 41
oh, just twist his arm. %$* 42
at what point-- %$* 41
i mean, maybe we're – we can gang up on our moderator here collectively. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 41
we still need to come up with a definition of smart technology, because at what point is a tap smart technology? %$* 41
my assumption in this debate-- %$* 41
and i think although the discourse around it, is that the smart technology of network society, it's digital technology. %$* 41
and in that sense, you know, david's arguments about the web i think were flatware %$* 41
so i do think we have to be careful because, after all, everything is technology. %$* 41
you know, this pen is technology. %$* 41
the-- %$* 41
a water pipe is technology, a bathroom is technology. %$* 41
i'm not arguing against those things. %$* 41
well, and as far as i know, bathrooms are not yet causing epistemological chaos, but we could get there. %$* 42
you haven’t been in mine. %$* 41
david weinberger, i-- %$* 13
so far. %$* 42
david? %$* 42
david, i want to-- %$* 13
i want to bring this back to a high level, high plane. %$* 13
your opponents mentioned arab spring as being something of a catastrophe of smart technology, by which i think what they're really saying is that at the time, back in 2011, that it was hailed as a-- %$* 13
as a moment of triumph for smart technology is making us dumb smart technology bringing together people forcing political action, ultimately leading to their liberation and freedom, or at least the impulse in that direction. %$* 13
and now it doesn't look so good. %$* 13
i want to sort of get your reaction to that. %$* 13
does arab spring represent the failure of the promise, or does the arab spring reveal the false promise of smart technology? %$* 13
i'm not sure who made the promises. %$* 43
i'm also not entirely sure what this has to do with being dumb. %$* 43
but-- %$* 43
or smart. %$* 43
well, i think it does in a sense that we're making broader claims about the-- %$* 13
about whether cultures are getting-- %$* 13
are being raised up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 43
so-- %$* 43
i do think there's some disagreement on the panel about what we're talking about in terms of culture. %$* 43
andrew. %$* 43
so-- %$* 43
i’m not sure what promise was made. %$* 43
i don't know who makes promises and so forth. %$* 43
but the internet proved itself not only to be a superb tool for organizing, for organizing people without a leader, which is a pretty remarkable thing. %$* 43
this was a leaderless organization. %$* 43
it also, i noticed, from talking with people from tunisia, they credit, at least in part, the internet with giving them the idea of freedom, the sense that they can have a voice. %$* 43
they should have a voice. %$* 43
they are-- %$* 43
it is their right as citizens because they can do it on the net. %$* 43
why can't they do it in public for their government? %$* 43
and i will use the word; that is empowering. %$* 43
and so they use the internet in a complex environment. %$* 43
they organize, they, in some senses, in some places, they won, and then larger forces came. %$* 43
it turns out that what we now know is that the internet is really great at leaderless organization, but doesn't necessarily always lead to the next stage of governing. %$* 43
so that-- %$* 43
nicholas carr. %$* 13
nick carr. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 13
i think the internet is a communication platform. %$* 40
and you can communicate good stuff, and you can communicate bad stuff. %$* 40
you can communicate healthcare information, as genevieve said, or you can be isis and send out youtube videos of beheadings as a recruitment tool. %$* 40
you can-- %$* 40
you can organize antigovernment protests or you can be the government using the technology to track those protesters and throwing-- %$* 40
throw them in jail. %$* 40
so i don't think you can-- %$* 40
i don't think you can leap to the assumption that even as a basic communication platform this is something that is naturally or inclined to be a good thing that raises people up and lets them think deeper thoughts. %$* 40
i think it can do both things, as all communication platforms do. %$* 40
and i think we really have to-- %$* 40
have to look at what-- %$* 40
how the technology influences what we do with the communications, how it influences our relationship to our thinking and to one another. %$* 40
and there, i think the picture is much darker. %$* 40
david weinberger. %$* 13
so, yes, internet is just a communication platform, but it's not just a communication platform. %$* 43
it has particular, as they say, affordances, things that it's good at. %$* 43
and so if you're on the internet, you are very likely going to learn some things beyond that you can communicate. %$* 43
you will learn that you can talk. %$* 43
you can speak. %$* 43
the entire world can listen. %$* 43
this is so different than it was 20 years ago. %$* 43
anybody anywhere can talk and the entire world can listen. %$* 43
they may not, but they can. %$* 43
it is an environment where you can speak without permission, and it's an environment that is linked. %$* 43
links are like the new punctuation. %$* 43
they're-- %$* 43
instead of putting a full stop or a half stop, you put a connection. %$* 43
this type of new punctuation is transformative in our idea of how things go together and our agency in doing so. %$* 43
so i don't think it's just a communication platform, and i think that you can generally learn some things just by using the internet. %$* 43
it does help shape some of those ideas. %$* 43
andrew keen, go ahead. %$* 13
i think, again, we have to be very, very careful here, david. %$* 41
you said the internet allows people to talk as if somehow in the pre-internet age, before computers, people couldn't talk. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumb it's that kind of argument which i think puts the digital camp in trouble, because the reality is, is that we always talked. %$* 41
the digital platform certainly does enable us to talk. %$* 41
it certainly enables us to get a global audience. %$* 41
but the reality, of course-- %$* 41
and mcluhan came out with this in his ironically termed "global village," is the ironic nature of the internet is it's not global. %$* 41
the ironic nature of the internet, okay, the wires are-- %$* 41
everywhere you go, it's the same-- %$* 41
it's the same technology and everyone's on the same platform. %$* 41
but the reality is study after study has shown-- %$* 41
as shown in an excellent book called "the filter bubble," the reality is that we're talking to fewer and fewer people. %$* 41
so if anything, i'm not going to-- %$* 41
i'm not going to fall into your dystopian/ utopian trap. %$* 41
but if anything, we're talking less now than we were before the invention of the internet. %$* 41
david weinberg. %$* 13
so, andrew, you have to hear the complete sentence. %$* 43
what i said is it enables us to talk, and the entire world to listen. %$* 43
and that is new. %$* 43
and as i said, not everybody in the world will-- %$* 43
let me-- %$* 43
not listening. %$* 41
that's the point. %$* 41
i mean, you could argue, if i shout loud enough, the entire world could hear. %$* 41
then you should have listened to the second sentence after that, in which i said, it doesn't mean that anybody is listening. %$* 43
so yes, filter bubble-- %$* 43
it also doesn't-- %$* 40
wait, guys. %$* 13
wait, wait. %$* 13
nick, nick, nick, let him make his point. %$* 13
i'm going to moderate now. %$* 13
let him make his point, and then we'll come back to you because you're kind of doing the thing that you're saying people do on the internet right now. %$* 13
but much higher value. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 13
we hear filter bubble is a serious issue to worry about, needs to be addressed somehow. %$* 43
and, yes, andrew, of course, not everybody hears what you're saying. %$* 43
but compared to the prior media regime, the ability for-- %$* 43
which was basically, if you wanted people to hear you, you put it-- %$* 43
you wrote a letter to the editor, and you're lucky if it got printed. %$* 43
and if it did, it went to your community. %$* 43
the ability for people to talk and to say uninteresting-- %$* 43
things that are interesting to them, but maybe not interesting to you-- %$* 43
and that matters. %$* 43
the ability of people to talk and address the world is new, and it is-- %$* 43
it is transformative. %$* 43
okay. %$* 13
i want to get a response from this side, but genevieve, we haven't heard from you in a while. %$* 13
and for that reason alone, i want to hear from you. %$* 13
but let's go back to nick to respond. %$* 13
wait. %$* 42
how does that work? %$* 42
sorry? %$* 13
i said, "how does that work? %$* 42
well, i want to-- %$* 13
it worked like this: i want you to talk soon. %$* 13
oh, right, not now. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb but i just wanted to have-- %$* 13
they were-- %$* 13
i asked them to wait, so i'm fulfilling my pledge to them to talk. %$* 13
i'll be brief. %$* 40
genevieve talked about, you know, that the internet may be making us dumb or that smart technology may be making us dumb now, or at least what's the evidence suggests but at some future, it'll make us smart. %$* 40
david talks about the fact that we-- %$* 40
that anybody can communicate anything to anyone else now. %$* 40
but what he doesn't talk about is what actually people use the internet for, for communicating. %$* 40
we're not all broadcasting these deep thoughts. %$* 40
we're sending out links to silly videos. %$* 40
we're going-- %$* 40
spending huge amounts of time on facebook. %$* 40
we're spending lots of time on twitter, sending snapchats. %$* 40
we have to-- %$* 40
in order to answer the question before us, we have to look at how this technology has actually evolved, how people are actually using it now, not some utopian dream of how it can be used, and how that reflects on the depth of the thought it is inspiring in us. %$* 40
genevieve bell, i think it's just been handed to you. %$* 13
i think it has. %$* 42
and i absolutely agree with you, nick. %$* 42
and i think the phrase that is a dead giveaway to me is, it's not like they're saying anything interesting, which you muttered before he cut you off earlier. %$* 42
the notion that anything interesting is telling, i said in my opening remarks that one of the challenges i have here is, what is dumb and what is lying underneath that judgment? %$* 42
and i think sometimes using dumb is a way of talking about some other things. %$* 42
it's-- %$* 42
buried in that is notions about what is appropriate discourse, what is sufficiently merit-worthy, what is-- %$* 42
and, you know, this is a place where, truthfully, you know, although david and i both fundamentally and violently disagree that smart devices are making us dumb, we do come at this from two very different positions. %$* 42
and mine is very much about saying, "listen, there are lots of things that people do with technology in this current moment that may not rise to the bar of tenured faculty and book writers.” that doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb. %$* 42
is everyone who's on facebook dumb? %$* 42
that makes everyone in this room dumb-- %$* 42
is-- %$* 42
i'm willing to bet, and if not you, then your children. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb and while you may say many things about your children, you are not yet willing to imagine they are dumb. %$* 42
does it mean that every single one of us who uses gps because we're directionally challenged is an idiot? %$* 42
does it mean the fact that i like microsoft to spellcheck me make me dumb? %$* 42
i don't think so. %$* 42
so there's sort of something in there about what is the judgment lurking beneath "dumb" that requires just a little bit of scrutiny. %$* 42
i'm going to audience questions now. %$* 13
and right-- %$* 13
sir, if you-- %$* 13
i'm looking right now-- %$* 13
if you could stand up, our mike's going to come down on your right hand side. %$* 13
and, again, if you can just hold it this close to your mouth so we can hear you, and tell us your name, and tell us your question. %$* 13
sure, my name is rahul. %$* 18
and my question is really about the kind of things that genevieve was talking about. %$* 18
if we agree that the more data points we have makes us-- %$* 18
allows us to have smarter decisions, regardless of how banal or mundane those decisions are, because the internet and smartphones give us more data points, doesn't that necessarily make us smarter in the decisions we're making, even if it's about knowing more about cute cats, but we're smarter about knowing about cute cats? %$* 18
i will give that point to you. %$* 40
nick carr. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
i think actually in theory that should be how things work, but as we've talked about with filter bubbles that actually what happens is people tend to go out and don't expose themselves to lots of different points of view and don't gather lots of different data points. %$* 40
we tend to go out, and we read and look at those kind of points of view that reinforce our own biases. %$* 40
so smart technology is making us dumb often it's not-- %$* 40
the dream was that we'd use the internet to challenge ourselves. %$* 40
in fact, what most people do is they go out and find stuff that confirms their existing biases, and that makes those biases even stronger. %$* 40
and let me just jump on your question in terms of-- %$* 41
andrew keen. %$* 13
this data points, this idea that knowledge is simply join the dots or join the data dots. %$* 41
it's more complex than that. %$* 41
as nick is saying, what we're losing is the subtlety, the depth, the sophistication of thought. %$* 41
in an odd way perhaps we're becoming like our machines. %$* 41
but that in an odd way as well makes us dumber than we once were. %$* 41
david weinberger. %$* 13
oh, so much to respond to. %$* 43
i'm going to give you 30 seconds because we want to go on to other questions. %$* 13
okay. %$* 43
i shouldn't have said that. %$* 43
dang it. %$* 43
yeah, yeah, you shouldn't have. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
so, to nick's point that we're-- %$* 43
we use the net to talk about things that aren't interesting, i think it's actually an argument against language itself, because most of what we use language for is to talk about things that are not broadly interesting. %$* 43
we seek out sites that we agree with in part because we fall prey to this filter bubble and confirmation bias thing, but also because when we want to-- %$* 43
that's how understanding works. %$* 43
when we want to understand something, we go-- %$* 43
to understand it is to fit it into our context. %$* 43
that's maybe a bug in how understanding works, but it is how understanding works. %$* 43
so it actually makes sense when you have a question smart technology is making us dumb to go to a site where your fundamental principles and context are shared so you can make sense of what they're saying. %$* 43
that's just how understanding works. %$* 43
fifty-five seconds. %$* 13
sir, right down front, here. %$* 13
the mike is coming. %$* 13
hi, my name is robert klein we can talk about the technology, the internet, and the search engines, but what about the devices themselves? %$* 18
i see a whole young generation of my grandchildren and their peers growing up with their-- %$* 18
and using their thumbs instead of their brains. %$* 18
and almost-- %$* 18
it's like a pacifier for young children. %$* 18
and so how can that possibly really produce young adults or teenagers who are smarter? %$* 18
i mean, how can it do anything but hold back the brain from achieving its full potential? %$* 18
let me take it to nick carr first. %$* 13
sure. %$* 40
i think they're-- %$* 40
i think the negative effects influence people of all ages, 80-year-olds as well as 10-year-olds. %$* 40
but i do think it's particularly dangerous for young children whose-- %$* 40
we know their brains are in the process of being formed. %$* 40
and we also know that the best thing you can do for a child is to give them lots of different experiences, interacting with the world in lots of different ways, playing with clay, doing-- %$* 40
you know, interacting with people face-to-face. %$* 40
and what we're doing often with a-- %$* 40
with even ever younger children is putting more and more of their attention on screens. %$* 40
and we're seeing this in schools, we're seeing it out of schools. %$* 40
and i think it's hard to conclude, from what we know about child development, that kind of giving this more and more constrained way of interacting with the world is going to produce broader-minded, more curious children. %$* 40
i think it's going to have the opposite effect. %$* 40
let me take the question to the other side. %$* 13
now, you're allowed to applaud. %$* 13
it's – if david or genevieve would like to take that? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 42
i mean, i think-- %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 42
genevieve-- %$* 13
there are a couple of things that run through that, right? %$* 42
is we have a persistent anxiety about the impact of new technologies on our children. %$* 42
this one has a particular kind of visceral-ness to it. %$* 42
i'm willing to bet many of your parents worried about the impact of radio, rock and roll, television on all of us. %$* 42
the jury is in some ways still out on rock and roll, obviously, but not the rest. %$* 42
there's something about why it is that we worry about technology and children in particular. %$* 42
and i think, you know, there are reasons to suggest-- %$* 42
and nick's right on this-- %$* 42
that a diversity of experiences is a good thing. %$* 42
the challenge, however, here, is also beyond the kind of notion that every child is born with a smart device in one hand, and only a thumb in the other. %$* 42
the reality is that in lots of places in the world, kids are not using new technology. %$* 42
in lots of places in the world, there are cultures about how technology is introduced into children that suggests that, you know, you may be disadvantaged because there are other places-- %$* 42
if that's your fear-- %$* 42
that this is not happening. %$* 42
but i think it's a hard one to argue, right, is to say, "is, you know, technology pernicious and bad for children? %$* 42
" well, it's an argument that's been rehearsed for nearly 200 years. %$* 42
and i think all of you are living proof in the room that rock and roll didn't rot your brains. %$* 42
well, maybe we would all be a lot smarter if that rock and roll thing hadn't happened. %$* 13
well, you know-- %$* 42
fair point. %$* 42
we could always go look for some countries that didn't have it and see what the comparative state is. %$* 42
ma'am, down here? %$* 13
the mike is to your left. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
do-- %$* 13
would you mind standing up? %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb oh, sure. %$* 19
thanks. %$* 13
i was just wondering if the answer would be different for the sciences and math versus-- %$* 19
i mean, we've been talking about-- %$* 19
a lot about reading, and on the internet, and things like that. %$* 19
and then you were talking about the particle collider. %$* 19
and so, i wonder if it would be two different-- %$* 19
are there-- %$* 19
do you have two different answers for the different disciplines? %$* 19
no. %$* 40
i don't. %$* 40
i mean, i think deep thinking is deep thinking, whether you apply it to a poem or to a scientific problem. %$* 40
i do think-- %$* 40
i mean, and that's not to say there aren't good things about being able to exchange information very quickly. %$* 40
i think science advances a lot-- %$* 40
in many cases, by being able to exchange information quickly. %$* 40
so that's a good thing about the internet. %$* 40
but you come back to the point that we are having more and more trouble screening out distractions and interruptions, and really thinking deeply about something, which means concentrating our focus and concentrating our mind. %$* 40
and that's every bit as important to scientific discovery as it is to the humanities, right? %$* 40
and i think it's important to add that both science-- %$* 41
andrew keen. %$* 13
and the humanities are victims of this technology. %$* 41
so, supporters of the smart technology often point to wikipedia and say, "well, wikipedia is the example of how smart technology works.” but all the research on wikipedia indicates that the content there isn't very reliable. %$* 41
so, for example, when it comes to the medical information on wikipedia, a board of doctors who researched this found that nine out of 10 articles on wikipedia about medical were inaccurate, which is obviously particularly troubling. %$* 41
so, i think we have to be careful to believe that somehow, smart technology generates reliable, scientific information, but not information about the humanities. %$* 41
i think it's-- %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumb listen-- %$* 43
unreliable in both sense. %$* 41
david weinberger. %$* 13
so, if i understand your question correctly, if we look into the sciences, we see that smart technology has enabled a rapid advance of those sciences. %$* 43
what we're doing now would be absolutely impossible without the internet. %$* 43
and not simply because of the rapid communication. %$* 43
it's really important-- %$* 43
but also because it has enabled-- %$* 43
things have grown up that enabled sophisticated collaboration. %$* 43
management of gigantic multinational projects. %$* 43

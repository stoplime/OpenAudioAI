getting away from the statistics and going to that police officers are highly trained with firearms. %$* 62
they practice and qualify, they can’t graduate from the academy with qualifying. %$* 62
without question, they can use the gun in a defensive mode. %$* 62
but when you look at the numbers of police officers in the united states and i remember—i can picture every moment to this day, of the first time i had an officer killed in the line of duty. %$* 62
young, bright, talented, incredible shape, shot 13 times with his own handgun. %$* 62
wasn’t a question of training, wasn’t a question of anything else. %$* 62
officers are routinely wounded and assaulted with their own guns. %$* 62
that’s why— %$* 62
that’s not true, that’s absolutely not true— %$* 65
officers are routinely assaulted— %$* 62
it’s an incredibly rare event— %$* 65
gary—gary kleck is— %$* 13
but anyhow— %$* 62
—objecting, but gary, hold off— %$* 13
there was a— %$* 62
—the entire reason that the entire gun industry made significant changes in holsters. %$* 62
it used to be that we all wanted the quick- draw holster, how fast could we get the holster out. %$* 62
now the holsters are designed, they’re cumbersome, they’re heavy, they are not quick-draw and they are designed and sold by the millions across this country for one reason and that is because of officers having the gun taken from them. %$* 62
gary—gary kleck is— %$* 13
—gary kleck, i just want to remind our radio listeners, gary kleck is arguing for the motion, the liberal %$* 13
who works just from the numbers. %$* 13
you know, here’s a number for you and it’s a very easy number to understand, for the most recent years for which we have data in the entire united states, there was exactly one police officer killed with his own gun, one. %$* 65
it is—you can stretch the concept “routinely” quite a bit but i don’t think one— %$* 65
but gary, how many officers— %$* 62
—out of 600,000 police officers in the entire united states— %$* 65
but how many were actually shot— %$* 62
—can really be described as routine. %$* 65
that’s, that’s some indication of the chief’s credibility when he says something happens frequently or routinely, one in 600,000 is not routine— %$* 65
but gary, you left out the number of the number of officers— %$* 62
and— %$* 65
—actually killed— %$* 62
—what he fails to point out— %$* 65
—very small— %$* 62
—is that police officers in fact are not assaulted anywhere near as often as civilians, and he’s right, there’s a very straightforward reason, they’re all armed with firearms, and trained. %$* 65
but— %$* 62
chief—chief—let the chief respond %$* 13
i mean, actually you’d have to be pretty stupid to assault an armed police officer who has a baton, a uniform, a radio— %$* 62
indeed you would— %$* 65
—a gun, pepper spray and extra ammunition and is wearing body armor. %$* 62
that probably is quite correct. %$* 62
but there are very few because of body armor and the changes in body armor in this country, there are very few police officers now killed or wounded in the line of duty, that the number—that the numbers that we used to see. %$* 62
so to say yes, one out of what, but what, 45 officers killed, shot— %$* 62
there were never many— %$* 65
so the ratio— %$* 61
there were never many even 20 years ago or 30 years ago before the advent of body armor, it was no more true than now, it’s simply untrue— %$* 65
yeah, you’re talking about at most five a year or so, even in the high years that that is. %$* 61
look, five, it’d be better if it was zero but if you look at the number of police officers who are assaulted in a year you’re talking about between 16 and 20,000.and so if you’re asking, what’s the rate of a police officer who’s assaulted, who’s going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against him—and going to result in his death, it’s a tiny number, but even more important i think to make is a comparison to civilians, because that’s partly the motivation for this. %$* 61
and police officers have a much more difficult job than civilians do, a police officer can’t brandish a gun, watch the criminal run away, and be satisfied that his job’s over with. %$* 61
if he has to come into physical contact with the criminal, and you’re much more likely to have something go wrong. %$* 61
one of the benefits a civilian has, if you take a right-to-carry class to get your permit someplace, one of the things they’re going to tell you is you’re not the police. %$* 61
your job isn’t to go and arrest people. %$* 61
the benefit that you have of having a gun, is to maximize the distance between yourself and the criminal. %$* 61
if he runs away, that’s basically what you’re done with, and that’s the reason why you had the gun. %$* 61
paul helmke— %$* 13
yeah, i— %$* 66
—paul helmke, as a former mayor of fort wayne to whom the police reported, were you surprised to hear stephen halbrook, who represents the nra, say that police do not have a responsibility to protect individuals? %$* 13
it’s— i think steve’s playing legalisms with what really happens, i mean the general slogan for most police departments is “to protect and defend.” i mean it’s their job to get out there, now they— %$* 66
but his argument is that— %$* 13
his argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t responded %$* 66
his argument really is because the police can’t do it people have to do it for themselves. %$* 13
and let me address that argument, it’s steve’s argument, at some extent, is true. %$* 66
people do have a right of self-defense. %$* 66
the supreme court made that very clear in the heller case, you know, i do wonder a little bit about justice roberts’s comments that he wasn’t, you know, he wanted to be able to shoot his gun but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses before that, and that’s the example steve just gave and i thought gee, if the chief justice needs to put on his glasses and turn the light on before he can shoot maybe, he shouldn’t be shooting, but— it gets into the issue of, yes, people do have a— %$* 66
people do have a right of self-defense. %$* 66
but what we do when we live in communities is we set up police departments because they’re the individuals that are trained, they’re the individuals that respond. %$* 66
and often when an individual has a gun in their home, again as i said it’s 22 times more likely to be used against them or a family member. %$* 66
homes with more guns have more gun violence, cities with more guns have more gun violence, states with more guns, countries with more guns, more gun violence, now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents, not just gun homicides. %$* 66
and when you talk about police departments—i ran the police department. %$* 66
20 percent of the time that an officer’s shot it’s his gun or his partner’s, so you’ve gotta expand that to the partner’s gun. %$* 66
20 percent of the time when an officer’s in a shoot-out situation, they miss their target— %$* 66
well, you’re running— %$* 13
—only 20 percent of the time do they hit their target— %$* 66
—into a lot of numbers here, i want to give stephen a chance to respond, stephen halbrook of the nra— %$* 13
there’s something really bizarre about this picture that citizens with guns are totally incompetent and police with guns are totally incompetent and they’re likely to be taken away from them, but somehow criminals are really good with guns, where— where did they get all this training. %$* 63
well, they’re not that good— %$* 66
there’s something bizarre about this picture that, citizens and police cannot defend themselves with guns but criminals can successfully use guns to aggress against other people, it doesn’t make—it’s against common sense. %$* 63
i’m not a statistician, i don’t think paul is either, we’re the two who aren’t here but it just doesn’t make sense to say that you should never be able to protect yourself, that you shouldn’t use a gun, that you’re incompetent, that you’re totally worthless with it and—it’s just, against any common sense. %$* 63
and, the fact that, this is not just a legalism, police have no duty to protect you. %$* 63
it’s not their fault by the way, of course their slogan is to protect and serve, they want to do that. %$* 63
but they have no legal compulsion to do it and of course even if you could sue them if they didn’t protect you after the kinds of scenarios we talked about, it wouldn’t do you any good, you may be dead or you’re otherwise injured. %$* 63
you want to be able to prevent the crime from happening. %$* 63
and the only way to do that in some circumstances is you have to be able to protect yourself. %$* 63
we’re going to go to the audience for some questions, now there are a lot of hands up and what we’re gonna do is pick out %$* 13
take two or three questions, do the questions first and then we’ll repeat them to the panel, so, why don’t you take that one right there %$* 13
brief, please. %$* 13
um— %$* 9
and i’m collecting questions so it’s me and then i’ll relay them. %$* 13
to the gentlemen %$* 9
for the motion, if you believe that guns reduce crimes, would you recommend that your children keep a gun handy. %$* 9
thank you. %$* 13
down here? %$* 13
i’ll come back. %$* 13
sorry, here? %$* 13
yes, i think that we’re conflating statistical data about societies and societal factors with the guns themselves. %$* 10
so i am not clear where you have had a concealed-carry law put into place, within that particular community so you can hold constant for crack use, or non-crack use, rural or urban. %$* 10
what has been the result, does it reduce crime, does it increase crime, and the other thing that i would appreciate you speaking to, is the word “regulate” in the second amendment, it seems to me that in our history, people regularly had gun ownership and it was not something that was precluded, so addressing that point and how it affected our— %$* 10
thank you— %$* 13
—opinions would be helpful. %$* 10
thank you. %$* 13
right to your left %$* 13
hi, i have a very quick question that’s a little bit more specific than just a broad topic. %$* 10
do you think that gun buy-back programs, help reduce crime and if yes, who evaluates these programs and why are they started in the first place— %$* 10
okay—thank you, we—those are good, those are all questions and they’re quite good and brief. %$* 13
should kids have guns to protect themselves, i suppose, what age are you talking about, when would you say— start saying this is a reasonable question to ask. %$* 13
um— %$* 9
microphone to your mouth. %$* 13
i was really interested, all these gentlemen seem to have—to be old enough to have children over 18 or 21. %$* 9
mm-hmm. %$* 13
i was wondering, their own children, would they recommend that their own children— %$* 9
for self-defense. %$* 13
not for hunting, not for sport— %$* 13
yeah— %$* 61
—self-defense. %$* 13
gentlemen, any of you support guns for children for self-defense. %$* 13
i hope my kids have guns— %$* 61
this is john lott answering. %$* 13
sorry, john, i spoke over you, go ahead? %$* 13
i mean i hope my kids have guns, when they get—i mean i didn’t own a gun until 1996 after i’d started doing the research that i did. %$* 61
as far as i know my family had never owned a gun. %$* 61
but at this point, given that i believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, i think i’d be disappointed if my kids didn’t own a gun. %$* 61
anybody on the other side respond to that? %$* 13
i wouldn’t want my daughter to have a gun. %$* 66
that’s paul helmke— %$* 13
when i look at the statistics about how that adds to the risk of suicide, the risk of being misused, the risk of it coming up, being stolen, used in a domestic quarrel, i think it’s just too much of a risk. %$* 66
john donahue against the motion. %$* 13
there’s also the social factor that the nra and our other panelists want to ignore. %$* 64
sean penn got the right to carry a concealed handgun in california which is tough to do, went to a berkeley restaurant for lunch one day, came back, his gun was— his two guns that he had left in his car were gone because the car had been stolen. %$* 64
they got a car back, a few days later, but the two guns were missing, so maybe it might’ve helped him at some point, but now somebody’s got sean penn’s guns, and i suspect it’s a criminal— %$* 64
okay, we’re a little— %$* 13
—that’s not going to use them very effectively— %$* 64
—we’re a little off the point of the question about children who are—the second question went to whether there are studies that show the impact of a concealed-carry law within a given community actually having had an impact, before that i have a question. %$* 13
how is a concealed weapon a deterrent, to the guy who can’t see it. %$* 13
because they don’t know who has it, and if you have a— %$* 63
so the community has it, in other words— %$* 13
if you’re in a state that has mandatory issuance of concealed- weapon permits, then criminals have no knowledge of who might be carrying legally, and you would think there would be more who would carry if it is legal than those who would do it out of desperation because of fear— %$* 63
so people who would not be carrying in that community would also be protected under that theory, because— %$* 13
absolutely, because the criminals don’t know who has the gun. %$* 63
john lott, you were going answer the question that the questioner put to us— %$* 13
right— %$* 61
—about whether the, sta—there is a— %$* 13
no, excellent question, actually. %$* 61
and, that’s precisely what you want to do, you don’t want to just compare across places because, you know, idaho is different than california and england has a different underlying crime rate before they change any types of gun control laws than the united states has. %$* 61
and so what you’re doing in these tests is, you’re precisely doing that, you’re seeing how crime rates change in a state after that state’s adopted right-to-carry laws, and how that change is comparing to other places that didn’t change their laws over that period of time. %$* 61
and there are lots of other things you’ll do, you’ll see, as that state issues more permits, you know, is there a greater drop that you see %$* 61
stephen halbrook was just mentioning is the probability that a criminal may come across somebody who’s able to defend themselves, is there some relationship between the increased risk that the criminal faces and, and further drops in crime. %$* 61
but, you know, that’s exactly the way that you want to do the test and all the tests that i do, that’s precisely the type of test— %$* 61
i’m seeing a great deal of skeptical looks from the opposing table. %$* 13
john— %$* 13
all the tests that john do— %$* 64
—john donohue’s taking this— %$* 13
all the tests that john do— %$* 64
—show that, crime gets better. %$* 64
but, again, this is exactly what the national academy of science looked at. %$* 64
and, they concluded the opposite, that the data did not— %$* 64
they did not conclude the opposite. %$* 65
they concluded that the data does not support the proposition that we’re debating today which is that guns reduce crime. %$* 64
no, actually what that report— %$* 65
gary kleck— %$* 13
—persistently said was, we don’t have strong enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about virtually every issue they addressed, so, that was more of a no-decision decision than it was reaching the opposite conclusion, they did not reach the conclusion that making it easy to get a carry permit increases crime. %$* 65
they did not conclude that john lott was wrong, and basically, you know, you learn nothing from what that particular panel said— %$* 65
—be—precisely because it was— %$* 65
—i’ve read the same report and i have to say, gary, that i read it the same way, actually, it was a bit of a pontius pilate moment that didn’t know who was right or who was wrong— %$* 13
we need more data— %$* 61
yeah, you kind of read the thing and you ask was this trip really necessary. %$* 65
i mean— %$* 65
one of the things, just real quick on concealed-carry— %$* 66
paul helmke— %$* 13
—the real issue is, who makes the decision on whether you’re getting a concealed-carry permit, and, and the real difference between states are those where it’s a shall-issue or versus may- issue. %$* 66
and a lot of states as the %$* 66
you have to explain what shall-and-may means— %$* 13
yeah, i was going to do that, shall-issue states, it basically, someone fills out a form, sometimes they don’t have to take a class, a lot of times in utah they don’t even have to live in the state. %$* 66
sometimes you can just send in a form that says, yes, i listened to a video or whatever, and send— here’s my check, and you get a concealed-carry permit. %$* 66
in other states it actually goes to the chief of police or to the sheriff, who does a check to see whether you—not only is your record clean but, in terms of the felony conviction, but they check to see are the police responding to your house every week because of domestic quarrels, is this a kid that you’ve had to arrest a number of times on minor things that aren’t going to be a disqualifier. %$* 66
then the police have some discretion, i had a police chief who turned down somebody for a gun because—he had a clean record, turns out the kid had been acquitted of killing his parents in a neighboring country five years earlier. %$* 66
it was questionable whether he should’ve been acquitted, it was one of those cases. %$* 66
my chief turned him down a few years later when it was easier to get those guns, he ended up killing his brother, brother-in-law, neighbor, with one of his 25 ak-47’s that he kept in the attic, so— it’s give the police a little more discretion on who’s getting these guns. %$* 66
right now, 48 of the 50 states have some version of either may issue or shall issue, so it’s hard to make comparisons between states that do and don’t have these things— %$* 66
let’s bring chief kerlikowske also to address the gun buy-back questioner. %$* 13
i will, i think the issue for us is clearly that there has to be far more than being mobile and not being blind as a reason to give someone a firearms permit. %$* 62
and just within the last several months at one of the largest festivals in the city, the folklife festival, tens of thousands of people and literally dozens of police officers, officers within spitting distance in fact of the crowd, a young man who had been on methadone, who had had a number of other problems, had a license issued by the sheriff in a neighboring county, so that he could carry a concealed firearm anywhere. %$* 62
and in the middle of this crowd he looked at someone, that person looked at him and they got into a fight, the gun went off and it not only discharged across the assailant, the person that he was fighting with-- %$* 62
and all they’d been fighting with were their hands-- %$* 62
the gun also then ended up going through the hand of a young man and into the thigh of another woman. %$* 62
that is a person that should’ve never had a concealed firearms permit. %$* 62
on the issue of gun buy-backs i think the research is pretty clear, does it deter crime, does it result in guns being taken off the street that are crime guns %$* 62
a lot of times they’re old guns, they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being found by people cleaning out garages, et cetera. %$* 62
taking those guns off the street is not a bad thing, remember a hundred-year- old firearm can kill someone. %$* 62
but i don’t think we see it as a huge issue as far as reducing crime. %$* 62
john, could you—just one second, i have just a little bit of business i need to do for our radio broadcast, to remind everyone that i’m john donvan of abc news and this is intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating, we have six panelists, three for and three against the motion, “guns reduce crime,” we are in the head-to-head section of the debate and taking questions from the audience—john lott. %$* 13
on the gun buy-back issue, i don’t know of one single academic study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate. %$* 61
we could talk about that more if you want to, but— one question that keeps on coming up here, a point from the other side is that, people with concealed handgun permits, they may do bad things. %$* 61
and it’s easy to check. %$* 61
in the state of washington you’ve had permits being issued since 1960.the type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only case i know like that in the state of washington, nobody has been convicted of murder for example in washington that’s had a concealed-carry permit, and you’re talking about almost 50 years. %$* 61
and you see that in state after state. %$* 61
in florida, you can go to the website for the department that issues permits, and they have detailed data there, you find that, from october 1987 through september 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people. %$* 61
of those people, 166 had had their permits revoked for any type of firearms violation. %$* 61
virtually all those were for one type of violation, that was someone who accidentally carried a concealed handgun into a gun-free zone like an airport or what have you— %$* 61
it’s interesting that— %$* 66
this is paul helmke %$* 13
—it’s interesting that florida’s brought up though, the— %$* 66
—the sun-sentinel, did a study in 2006, before the legislature closed off this website, this is the new move by the way, is that the gun pushers come in and they say we don’t want this information to be public because we don’t want you to know what’s happening with the concealed carry permit holders. %$* 66
but the sun-sentinel found 216 people with active warrants, 128 with domestic violence restraining orders, nine people charged with felonies or reckle—or violent reckless demeanors, six red— registered sex offenders, at least one prison inmate, and another 1400 people who had pled guilty or no-contest to felony charges, all had concealed-carry permits in the state of florida— %$* 66
and then—and the florida legislature, said, we don’t want to make this information public anymore. %$* 66
gary kleck says that paul helmke is leaving something out— %$* 13
but notice what paul is leaving out of that, you may have been listening for how many people did something with their gun that they are now legally entitled to carry around in public places. %$* 65
how many times did they commit a violent crime in a public place, that’s the oily thing a carry permit allows you to do that you couldn’t do without the permit. %$* 65
in fact, none of those people did a violent crime with a gun in a public place and the fact that they had carry permits had absolutely nothing to do with anything, there was no— %$* 65
we’re gonna go back to— %$* 13
—there was no harmful consequence— %$* 65
—questions from the audience while we still have some time— %$* 13
—of them getting those carry permits. %$* 65
down in the front, we’ll do three again, as before. %$* 13
right, my question is for those who are in favor of the proposition. %$* 9
isn’t there a distinction between a handgun, and a more excessive weapon like an ak-47, would you have the same attitude toward those more— %$* 9
thank you. %$* 13
that’s— i take the point, in the, in the back? %$* 13
yes, sir. %$* 13
the question went unanswered earlier, why isn’t the united states the safest country in the world, if we have so many guns, and if you add to that, the fact that the incarceration rate here is so high so theoretically we’ve already taken off a large amount of criminals from the street. %$* 9
can i answer that— %$* 61
well, we’ll come to the third question, i just wanna bring in a third question, where, do we have a mic? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
you have a bunch of hands around here. %$* 13
i’m just wondering with, regards to illegal gun ownership, how, no one has addressed exactly how to reduce that. %$* 9
you know, we’re talking about increasing the supply of guns. %$* 9
how about reducing the supply to criminals and people that shouldn’t have them. %$* 9
i’m going to not take the question because it’s a little bit off the point of our actual motion, with respect, but thank you, we’ll take one more? %$* 13
can you move to the lady %$* 13
i—you can’t see, but a little bit forward? %$* 13
she’s standing to you? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
to the whole panel, can you back off a bit, and say what exactly would constitute supporting or refuting the proposition that gun reduces crime how would you, um, adjust for, um %$* 10
other contributing circumstances, how do you evaluate what is anecdotal evidence and what is significant evidence, how can you determine that you’re comparing, not comparing apples and oranges. %$* 10
surely, calling the nra execrable doesn’t constitute evidence one way or another so— %$* 10
okay, we take your point on the question and thank you for it. %$* 13
is an ak-47 something that people should have a right to carry around, in the—on the same terms as a handgun. %$* 13
stephen halbrook, who represents the nra— %$* 13
the second amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms and the question is what kinds of arms are constitutionally protected and the supreme court just addressed that in the heller case and said that, handguns are commonly possessed by law-abiding citizens historically for lawful purposes. %$* 63
rifles and shotguns, now, the term ak-47 is very ambiguous, if it means a real ak-47 that means a fully automatic machine gun. %$* 63
they’re very highly restricted in this country, they have to be registered with the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. %$* 63
they’re not possessed by that many people, they’re not used in crimes by the way, registered ak-47’s, there’s not very many of them around. %$* 63
but that’s really never where the debate has been, the debate has always been, for example the brady center supporting the d.c.handgun ban. %$* 63
what people are concerned about is the ability to have a normal kind of gun in their house to protect themselves and to have rifles, pistols and shotguns for sporting purposes or other lawful purposes. %$* 63
the debate has never been about ak-47, there’s been %$* 63
there are certain kinds of rifles that might look like an ak-47 and they’re called by the press assault weapons but they’re not assault weapons and they’re not ak-47’s, they just have certain cosmetic features that are similar, so— %$* 63
but from a public relations point of view i think the question makes some sense if it’s put in terms of do you—are there certain categories that should be restricted more from the public than handguns are. %$* 13
real ak-47’s, i don’t know of anybody who advocates deregulating them under current, the federal law which is very strict— %$* 63
steve, didn’t you file— %$* 66
paul helmke— %$* 13
—something with the supreme court arguing that the machine gun ban was unconstitutional? %$* 66
i mean you’ve argued that machine guns should be allowed, right— %$* 66
the— %$* 63
you know, this whole thing is really a red herring— %$* 65
wait, let stephen answer that, that was a question to stephen. %$* 13
right, the national firearms act passed in 1934 provides that, certain kinds of highly restricted firearms can be registered and possessed by law-abiding citizens who go through these extreme background checks and %$* 63
if you were to pass a ban on any kind of gun it does raise questions under the second amendment as well as the interstate commerce clause, and there was a supreme court where we raised that issue. %$* 63
we did not argue that machine guns were protected by the second amendment, we argued that, a constitutional issue was raised by whether they should be banned or not and it’s something that— it had to do with a statutory interpretation, it’s not a case that was a second amendment case—the only second amendment case the supreme court has dealt with is the heller case, and it’s decided that the kind of guns that we’re all ordinarily talking about here, rifles, pistols and handguns are the ones that are, i’m sorry, rifles, shotguns and handguns are the ones that are constitutionally protected— these other issues are red herrings. %$* 63
gary kleck, your fellow team member— %$* 13
i think it’s kind of ironic here that we hear an echo of the nra’s old slippery slope argument, you know, that if they have even moderate control it’ll eventually lead to prohibition, this is kind of the flip-side of that. %$* 65
that if we in any way allow non-criminal citizens to have guns for self-protection that it’s bound to lead somehow down a slippery slope to everybody having machine guns and opening up in church on sunday— %$* 65
now, come on—we are not arguing that— %$* 66
and, also— %$* 65
—we are not supporting— %$* 66
—you know, you kinda—why do these guys on the other side— %$* 65
we— %$* 66
—always come up with weirdo anecdotes— %$* 65
we don’t argue for gun bans— %$* 66
—about the one in a million— %$* 65
—i’ve got no— %$* 66
—case where— %$* 65
okay— %$* 13
—where things go badly— %$* 65
—simultaneous conversation actually is not working— %$* 13
i’ve got no problems with folks, i’ve got no problems with folks owning guns for hunting, for collecting, for self-defense, i want them to make sure they understand the responsibilities that go with that gun, i want them to know that the heller case says that there are restrictions that you’re allowed to have on guns and that governments can do those restrictions. %$* 66
and i think if you get that commonsense approach and realize we got gun bans off the table, and we’ve got the whole idea of anybody, any gun, anywhere, anytime is off the table too, let’s figure out what can work to make our communities safer in the middle. %$* 66
that means i think some restrictions on these large-capacity clips, restrictions on machine guns, doing the background checks, limiting the number of guns you can buy at one time— %$* 66
paul— %$* 65
—doing things to deal with illegal trafficking— %$* 66
your organization supported bans— %$* 65
those things make sense and it’s not a— %$* 66
i want to wrap this up because our third questioner asked the question for the third time tonight, if the united states has so many handguns why is it not the safest nation in the world, and john lott, i think the question— or gary kleck, you can answer it. %$* 13
and my response is, you know, if we have 600,000 police officers, more than any other democracy in the world, why didn’t we eliminate crime. %$* 65
you know, if we lock up two million people in prison, why didn’t it eliminate crime. %$* 65
the simple answer is no one solution is going to solve crime and no one proposed that it did, that’s a non-argument. %$* 65
nothing is a perfect solution or a complete solution and you hear no one on this panel make that argument. %$* 65
it’s just a matter of given that we don’t have a complete solution to the problem, what do we do in the meanwhile, what do we do right now, what do individuals do, and why would you want to prevent them from doing something that makes them safer. %$* 65
and john lott, you’re gonna have the final word in this section, go ahead— %$* 13
okay, thank you. %$* 61
even across countries, there are countries in the world that have more gun ownership than occurs in the united states, you have switzerland, for example, you have— which has one of the lowest— %$* 61
self-defense— %$* 66
—traditionally one of the lowest murder rates in europe. %$* 61
you have israel, which probably has the highest gun possession rate in the world and yet, traditionally has one of the lowest murder rates in the world. %$* 61
there are lots of things that affect crime rates across places. %$* 61
if you look in the united states, 50 percent of the counties in the united states have zero murders in any given year. %$* 61
25 percent of the counties have one murder. %$* 61
over 70 percent of the murders in the united states are concentrated in just over 3 percent of the counties, those counties represent over 20 percent of the population but they get over 70 percent of the murders. %$* 61
and yet if you look across it, it’s the counties without any murders that have by far the highest gun ownership rates, it’s the, it’s the few percent that have 70 percent where you have by far the lowest gun ownership rates. %$* 61
so, i mean there are lots of things that are going on there, there are drug gangs that i think populate these high-crime urban areas that’s a real problem. %$* 61
and one can go and talk about the problems there, that’ll be a different subject to go into. %$* 61
and— %$* 61
all right, john, i’m going to stop you there because of a time issue. %$* 13
i want to point out where we at this point, we’ve wrapped up the, the head-to-head section, and we are at the point, approaching the point where we need all of you to make the decision that decides, how this evening ends. %$* 13
let’s— to remind you when you came in and we polled you on the motion, “guns reduce crime,” 13 percent of you agreed, 60 percent of you disagreed. %$* 13
and 27 percent were undecided, we have heard the bulk of the arguments and the back-and-forth. %$* 13
but now we’re going to allow each panelist to sum up his position with a two- minute statement, beginning with the seattle chief of police, gil kerlikowske. %$* 13
chief? %$* 13
sure, i want to restate in the second sentence when i did my seven minutes, i said there is no debate about people’s right to own and possess guns. %$* 62
it is what the supreme court has defined as the reasonableness issue. %$* 62
john lott told you that, well, people with concealed firearms rarely commit murders. %$* 62
guess what, people that go through some type of check and go through a police department to get their concealed firearms permit, don’t go out and commit a lot of crimes. %$* 62
but, he also used the same argument that, well, let me tell you that people wouldn’t make the newspaper if you threaten somebody with a gun who was trying to rob you and it went off and it wouldn’t even be reported. %$* 62
i can tell you that people with concealed firearms permits drive drunk—with a gun in their holster in their car. %$* 62
people with concealed firearms permits in which we sent a clerk home because she issued one on a monday, and on friday when she was filing saw that the person had, after getting the permit committed suicide with a gun within the same week. %$* 62
and one of our young women officers who talked a drunken women out of a gun who was holding it to her head and her face and in her lap, and finally was able to wrestle it away, had just gotten her concealed firearms permits. %$* 62
none of those cases made the newspapers, so there are plenty of cases out there, as an example. %$* 62
i think reasonableness should enter into this, it should be more than just being upright and not being blind to allow you to carry a gun. %$* 62
thank you, chief kerlikowske, seattle chief of police speaking against the motion. %$* 13
speaking for the motion in his summarizing statement, john lott, senior research scholar at the university of maryland. %$* 13
thank you all again very much for inviting us here, it’s a great pleasure to be here. %$* 61
you know, there are a lots of things that affect crime. %$* 61
i think—as i said before i think police are the single most important factor. %$* 61
but we can deal with numbers on a lot of these things, we have anecdotal stories, the police chief just went through some. %$* 61
i advise you, you can go and check these things out. %$* 61
the florida department of—of issuing these concealed handgun permits has detailed records, you can go to their website. %$* 61
the texas department of public safety, if you just google texas department of public safety, concealed handguns, they’ll go through year by year, and tell you how many permit- holders have been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol. %$* 61
and you’ll—it’s an incredibly tiny number, that this happens. %$* 61
i’m not saying it’s zero. %$* 61
but the rate at which people lose their permits for any type of firearms-related violation, he gave examples of that, you look, state after state, it’s hundreds or thousands of one percentage point. %$* 61
off-duty police officers in florida, were arrested and convicted at higher rates by about four times greater than concealed-carry permit holders were arrested in florida during the same period of time. %$* 61
and i want to respond to john donohue’s comments about d.c.it’s not true whether you look at rates or you look at numbers that you’re going to see the murder rates fall or robbery rates fall after d.c.’s handgun ban. %$* 61
it goes up in either case. %$* 61
it just goes up more with the rate, and with—when he says it falls what happens is, when you’re just looking at the numbers, the numbers are falling quickly before the ban, and rising relatively slowly after, and what he does is compare the before average, and the after average, and that makes it look like the before average is higher than the after average, so it looks like, well, it’s fallen, but it’s just the average, if you look at year by year, you use it’s falling slowly and then rising faster afterwards. %$* 61
there’s no way you can break down these numbers, and not see that d.c., chicago, england, jamaica, ireland, other countries which have banned guns have not seen increases in violent crime rates afterwards. %$* 61
and d.c. just didn’t rise relative to what it was before, it went from being 15th to one or two in the country. %$* 61
thank you, john lott. %$* 13
summarizing his position against the motion, john donohue, economist and professor of law at yale. %$* 13
again, the d.c.case is a case of a city that was massively depopulating with its most affluent citizens leaving at the time. %$* 64
steve levitt, the author of freakanomics, is a john bates clark award winner, sometimes described as the junior nobel prize in economics. %$* 64
he dismissed john lott’s more guns, less crime theory in his books and writing, when other scholars tried to look at this work they found that right-to-carry laws simply don’t bring down the rate of crime. %$* 64
we have heard the discussion in the united states. %$* 64
there are many features of the united states that would suggest we’d have one of the lowest rates of violent crime, rich countries in general have low rates of violent crime, we’re the richest. %$* 64
we have more people in prison than any other country in, in world history. %$* 64
in fact no european country has even half the level of incarceration rate that we have. %$* 64
yet, our crime rate is phenomenally high and you hear, the proposition is that more guns would reduce crime, we have 42 percent of the world’s guns in civilian hands in the united states, how many more would we need to get down to the level of crime of our european allies, they mentioned switzerland and israel, again these are completely inapposite. %$* 64
switzerland has a regime in which individuals are in a militia, they take home an assault weapon, and they are given a locked container of ammunition that they’re not allowed to open up, they have to repeatedly come to headquarters and show that they haven’t opened it up and if they have they’re put in jail. %$* 64
in israel, they do put you in jail if you lose your gun. %$* 64
this is the problem. %$* 64
they keep ignoring the fact that millions, or between 500,000 and a million of guns are stolen every year, that means a gun in a criminal’s hands, even if it’s keeping you epsilon safer by having a gun, when your gun gets turned over to a criminal, that’s making everybody else more unsafe. %$* 64
so it doesn’t matter what happens to the right-to-carry holder, and what he did, it matters what happens to the gun that he got, that then got used by a criminal to kill someone else. %$* 64
thank you, john donahue. %$* 13
summing up his position for the motion, “guns reduce crime,” stephen halbrook, attorney representing the nra in several lawsuits. %$* 13
thank you, john, i want to respond to two things that professor donohue has stated in the heller case the supreme court decided that the second amendment guarantees the individual right of, of individual citizens to keep and bear arms including handguns. %$* 63
that’s the position that the nra has taken, for many, many decades through— of its history since 1871.and mr. %$* 63
donohue said that the nra does not tell the truth on the second amendment. %$* 63
well, then the supreme court doesn’t either because that’s what the supreme court held in the heller case. %$* 63
if you walk out back and you go to the bookstand here at this auditorium you’ll see a book called the founders’ second amendment, which i authored-- %$* 63
it’s a new book on the history of the second amendment and you’ll see, basically agreement with what the supreme court held, that it is an individual right, that the nra did not make it up. %$* 63
in addition, i’ve been to switzerland many times and participated in shooting matches with military rifles. %$* 63
and you can buy all the ammunition you want at the shooting ranges and at gun shops. %$* 63
you’re issued a tin of ammunition that you’re not allowed to open because they want it to be available if the militia army has to be mobilized, but there’s no restriction on your ammunition usage or purchases, so it’s— every swiss male when he enters age 20 is issued a military assault rifle and he keeps it at home. %$* 63
and there’s an extremely low crime rate in switzerland. %$* 63
a remaining thought i would like to say in favor of the proposition, is, i would like everybody to kind of think about yourself. %$* 63
you’ve heard here tonight, that we’re all potential murderers, that if we get angry if we have a gun we’re gonna kill somebody. %$* 63
it’s just not true, most people with these concealed-weapon permits, are just like you and me, they’re normal people, they don’t just suddenly get angry or, or have a couple glasses of wine and, and go on murderous sprees. %$* 63
we’re not like that, most americans are good people—they can be trusted with guns, and they should be trained. %$* 63
children should be trained in gun safety but to somehow act like all potential criminals is just, completely beyond the pale. %$* 63
thank you, stephen halbrook. %$* 13
summing up his position against the motion, “guns reduce crime,” paul helmke, president of the brady campaign and brady center to reduce gun violence. %$* 13
again i want to thank all of our listeners tonight, the question you have to ask yourself is, did the other side prove its case, did they prove that guns reduce crime. %$* 66
you haven’t really heard any evidence that shows that it did. %$* 66
and i think the question you should ask yourself to just get a gut-check on this is, when you’re at the next sporting event, or when you’re sitting in the restaurant, would you feel safer thinking that everyone had a gun, or that no one had a gun. %$* 66
the reason that you react that way, is because you know instinctively that we make it too easy for dangerous people and people that don’t know the responsibilities that go with guns to get guns. %$* 66
i ask the question, why aren’t we the safest country in the world if we’ve got so many guns. %$* 66
it’s because we make it too easy, we don’t know where those guns are, we don’t know who has the guns. %$* 66
and if you have a gun, and again i’m not anti-gun and if you want a gun and understand the responsibilities, fine. %$* 66
but there are responsibilities that go with it, the supreme court made it clear there are restrictions that go with it. %$* 66
where do the guns come from that the bad guys, that the gang members get. %$* 66
they steal them from people like you. %$* 66
they steal them from gun stores who lose their—quote, “lose” 30,000 guns every year. %$* 66
they get them through straw purchase. %$* 66
there are no limits on the number of guns you can buy at one time, there are very few limits on the type of guns you can buy. %$* 66
in most places in this country there really are no laws %$* 66
very few laws, restricting who gets guns. %$* 66
we make it too easy for dangerous people to get guns. %$* 66
the way to reduce crime is to do things like background checks. %$* 66
fight the illegal trafficking in guns. %$* 66
say that some guns should not be in the hands of the civilian population. %$* 66
those are things that can help take down the crime rates in our communities, not flooding our communities with more guns. %$* 66
thank you very much. %$* 66
thank you, paul helmke. %$* 13
and our final speaker, as we approach the moment of truth %$* 13
speaking for the motion, “guns reduce crime,” gary kleck, professor of criminology and criminal justice at florida state. %$* 13
you may remember i started out my opening remarks by saying you sometimes need to listen for the silences, and i think the panelists on the other side demonstrated that because they didn’t in fact address the evidence that we presented %$* 65
paul helmke insists we didn’t present any evidence, we cited some of the most thoroughly vetted scientific evidence we have on the question. %$* 65
study after study repeatedly showed the same thing, it showed defensive gun use as common, it showed defensive gun use as effective. %$* 65
it shows that after we pass these shall-issue carry laws and make it easy to, to get a carry permit, crime does not go up %$* 65
it’s also a sign of a weakness, of a particular position when people have to misstate what the issue is, remember the proposition was that guns reduce crime, okay, do they make you safer to have a gun %$* 65
well, we didn’t really hear anything about that. %$* 65
instead we hear paul helmke saying would you feel comfortable with everybody having a gun, well of course that’s not the issue, nobody here proposed that because of course “everybody” includes lunatics, convicted murderers, robbers, rapists and so on. %$* 65
it’s not the proposition, and in fact no one here even secretly thinks that we ought to do that, it’s not an issue, so why not confront the issue, do guns reduce crime. %$* 65
well, in fact guns in the hands of non-criminals, guns in the hands of crime victims, do make them safer. %$* 65
so what does this imply for policy, well, the implication for policy is, let’s do what we can to keep guns away from criminals, but that should not include taking them away from non-criminals who would use them to save their lives, to prevent the completion of rapes and robberies, to prevent injuries, and to prevent the loss of property, we should instead do what common-sensically most of america has been doing for decades which is moderate controls aimed at preventing criminals from getting guns but without denying them to non-criminals. %$* 65
that was gary kleck, thank you. %$* 13
and now we are at the moment of truth, you can turn once again to the keypads by your seats and we want you to vote on our motion, “guns reduce crime.” press “1” if you support the motion, press number “2” if you are against, press number “3” if you are undecided, it will take us about 90 seconds to tabulate the results, in the meantime i want to point out what’s coming up next. %$* 13
on tuesday, november 18th, the motion of our debate will be, “google violates its ‘don’t be evil’ motto.” panelists for the motion include harry lewis, a professor of computer science at harvard, randall picker, a professor of commercial law at the university of chicago law school, and siva vaidhyanathan who is professor of media studies and law at the university of virginia. %$* 13
against the motion, we have john batelle who is founder, chairman and ceo of federated media publishing, esther dyson, an investor in information technology companies, and jeff jarvis, director of the interactive journalism program at the city university of new york. %$* 13
these debates as we’ve made clear several times can be heard on more than 150 npr stations across the country. %$* 13
so just check your local npr station for the date and times of the broadcast. %$* 13
the results are coming down %$* 13
as i point out the copies of books and dvd’s, books by all of these people are on sale in the lobby %$* 13
and they are very willing to sell and sign. %$* 13
and finally a reminder that our debate on december 2nd, “bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years” %$* 13
which was not meant to be an applause line— will be recorded for broadcast on bbc world news television and to accommodate that taping for that broadcast, we will be moving the debate to the symphony space. %$* 13
that’s at 95th and broadway, and for more information, please visit our website, and now, the results %$* 13
hmm. %$* 13
before the debate, 13 percent were for the motion, 60 percent were against, and 27 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, there was movement on all fronts but it looks as though the motion— the side for the motion moved more of you. %$* 13
27 percent agree with the motion that guns reduce crime, 64 percent of you disagree, and now only 10 percent of you are undecided. %$* 13
so, it was a close, a close call, with a little bit of an edge to those for the motion in terms of moving and changing minds. %$* 13
congratulations to all of our panelists. %$* 13

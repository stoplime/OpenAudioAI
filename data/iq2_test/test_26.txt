maybe there's something to it. %$* 70
in fact, i think in some instances, there are. %$* 70
we should not accept this, however, as an uncontroversial proposition. %$* 70
the fact of the matter is that there are people who have studied the same phenomena that disagree very much with professor sander and others who have made the sort of claims that you've heard. %$* 70
you've heard the claim, for instance, that affirmative action actually decreases the numbers of black lawyers. %$* 70
there are other people who have studied the data and have come to a very different conclusion. %$* 70
so, the empirical situation is itself-- %$* 70
you know, it's controversial. %$* 70
it's not clearcut. %$* 70
furthermore, i'm willing to stipulate, for the sake of argument-- %$* 70
i'm willing to stipulate that what they say is true. %$* 70
so let's stipulate that. %$* 70
i'll give them that. %$* 70
then the question becomes, what of it? %$* 70
my opponents have a certain strange solicitude. %$* 70
they want to save the-- %$* 70
they want to save african american and latino students from getting the invitation to selective institutions. %$* 70
no one is forcing anyone to attend these institutions. %$* 70
if they don't want to go, they don't have to go. %$* 70
so-- %$* 70
but i think that there are-- %$* 70
but why would we not allow people the opportunity to advance themselves if they, you know, so desire and if these institutions believe that it is in their interest, their institutional interests, to invite these students to come? %$* 70
let me take that to-- %$* 13
who would like to take that? %$* 13
i'll take it. %$* 69
okay, rick sander. %$* 13
so we may be able to resolve this debate and just come to agreement. %$* 69
i will agree with randall that i withdraw all my objections to affirmative action if colleges and universities will adopt the following practice: when they accept someone for admission, they also provide a detailed statement of how that student's credentials predict their performance. %$* 69
if they're an engineering applicant, tell them the chances, tell them the past record of students with identical credentials who have actually achieved an engineering degree at that school. %$* 69
if they want to go to law school, tell them, what are the chances that a student with their credentials has passed the bar on the first attempt and what their gpa has been on average. %$* 69
if that information is provided, then you're right, all that affirmative action is doing is increasing the range of opportunities. %$* 69
what's wrong with that? %$* 69
the problem is the schools don't do that. %$* 69
they do not provide transparent. %$* 69
they actually actively counter measure. %$* 69
they actively conceal. %$* 69
they won't disclose data on what they're doing. %$* 69
they tell students that everyone has the same chance of success. %$* 69
everyone is equally qualified and will have the same outcomes. %$* 69
these things are manifestly not true. %$* 69
so students are accepting offers based on dramatic information-- %$* 69
misinformation. %$* 69
bring it to-- %$* 13
and you don't have to take my word for it. %$* 69
there was actually a study done at duke where a professor looked at the information that the university had internally and went to students and said, okay, if you have this information, what would your enrollment decision be? %$* 69
and they made different decisions. %$* 69
ted shaw. %$* 13
well, first, i invite you all to look at studies that have been done by richard a.burke of university of pennsylvania, david e.ho of stanford university, richard brooks, later of yale but now at columbia law school, and other studies, many other studies. %$* 71
look at claude steele's stereotype threadwork. %$* 71
these propositions that our adversaries have articulated today are challenged. %$* 71
they are very much being contested. %$* 71
but even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good? %$* 71
you know, the issue of presence of students of color who have been underrepresented and excluded from these institutions until there were conscious efforts to admit them is much bigger than test scores. %$* 71
we're talking about the integration of campuses. %$* 71
we're talking about equal opportunity on campuses. %$* 71
and if we want to look to evidence, look to the president of the united states, the attorney general, the ceo of american express. %$* 71
look to the two supreme court justices who are at-- %$* 71
one african-american, one latina. %$* 71
look to african-americans, look to latinos who are graduated within the last couple of generations from selective institutions, including this one. %$* 71
and there's massive evidence of the success of what we call affirmative action. %$* 71
all right. %$* 13
let's take that point to gail heriot. %$* 13
well, first of all, no one has ever rebutted the studies that i cited, not anyone. %$* 68
the only report that's actually been taken on by some of the scholars is rick's, as i said. %$* 68
and again, some of those same scholars are the ones who basically said the database isn't good enough and then tried to prevent him from getting access to the california database. %$* 68
as i said, that really speaks volumes. %$* 68
and, sure, there are plenty of people who have benefited in some way. %$* 68
i don't know whether any of the people that you listed are among them because i don't know what the counter factual is. %$* 68
i suspect that you and randall would have been very successful even without preferences, assuming that you got preferences. %$* 68
and i don't know that. %$* 68
one interesting thing is that there's one bit of evidence from-- %$* 68
let me just stop you. %$* 13
in 1950, these guys would have done as well as they have done in 1980, 1990, 2000? %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
if there were racial preferences in any-- %$* 13
in their lives? %$* 13
they claim to be the beneficiaries of racial preferences. %$* 68
if that's so, it may well be that they-- %$* 68
but are you saying that they would have-- %$* 13
i think-- %$* 13
i just want to clarify. %$* 13
you're saying in the absence of racial preferences that they would have done as well. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
yeah, they may have. %$* 68
okay. %$* 13
and my point i was making earlier. %$* 68
one kind of interesting shred of evidence here-- %$* 68
and i-- %$* 68
it's just a shred, but i find it rather interesting. %$* 68
first lady michelle obama actually did a senior thesis on the issue of how blacks at princeton integrate into society. %$* 68
and one of the things that she found, she polled, i believe it was, 400 black alumni at princeton. %$* 68
her response rate was really not-- %$* 68
not very high, so i'm not claiming this is a very scientific report, but it's interesting. %$* 68
she actually found that before princeton and after princeton-- %$* 68
that was her comparison-- %$* 68
that black students felt that they were just as comfortable with whites on athletic basis, i believe on several social bases. %$* 68
when it came to comfort with-- %$* 68
with whites on an academic basis, they actually became less comfortable after princeton than what they were before, which was an interesting result. %$* 68
ted shaw or randy, if you have-- %$* 13
randy hasn't had a shot in the bit, so if you'd like to speak, or you can pass all. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 70
ted shaw. %$* 13
well, a couple of things, one, gail, i-- %$* 71
it's a wonderful thing if nobody's ever rebutted you. %$* 71
that seems to me to be different from what my experience in academia is generally with studies, but i'll check it out. %$* 71
not rebutted me, but the studies, the studies. %$* 68
more importantly, though, to be clear, i didn't claim to be the beneficiary of preferences. %$* 71
that's a loaded term. %$* 71
use that term, the debate is over. %$* 71
i claim to be a beneficiary of affirmative action, and i restate that. %$* 71
i am, unapologetically, the light of opportunity did not shine in neighborhoods like the one i came from, in areas like the area i came from until people consciously took action to do it. %$* 71
it didn't happen serendipitously. %$* 71
and it doesn't mean that i or people like me are not qualified. %$* 71
so i appreciate you saying i would have made it anyway. %$* 71
i don't-- %$* 71
i don't accept that. %$* 71
i mean, i'd like to think that maybe it was true. %$* 71
but the fact is that what that does is obscure the structural inequality that has existed in our country and that's built into our country. %$* 71
and we still have not rid ourselves of that structural inequality. %$* 71
rick sander, do you want to respond, or would you like to move to another question? %$* 13
well, i would just say, if you look at the debate on law school mismatch, which, as gail says, has been the most contested one, it's interesting. %$* 69
i mean, i published my initial study. %$* 69
the data was limited. %$* 69
my analytical abilities were probably limited. %$* 69
there were about 20 critical studies published in response. %$* 69
but none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals. %$* 69
a debate was joined, new articles came out. %$* 69
if you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch. %$* 69
they all find roughly the disparity in chances caused by large preferences that i mentioned before. %$* 69
there have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side. %$* 69
and the most recent critique was actually withdrawn when the author admitted that her results cannot be replicated. %$* 69
so if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern. %$* 69
now, i would slightly modify gail's statement that there are many good studies that say that preferences can have net positive effects. %$* 69
but when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates. %$* 69
the things that we're talking about with mismatch are things like learning, competition, grades, attrition from a science track and so on, things that are directly related to mismatch. %$* 69
graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies. %$* 69
a law school or college can decide they want to get their graduation rate up to 97 percent. %$* 69
so if you look at some secondary outcomes, i think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed. %$* 69
randy kennedy. %$* 13
first, you know, the proposition was affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, 99 percent of the discussion has been about racial affirmative action. %$* 70
of course, affirmative action's broader than that. %$* 70
women have certainly-- %$* 70
including white women, have been beneficiaries of affirmative action. %$* 70
it's interesting that that doesn't seem to factor very much into the discussion. %$* 70
i would like very much to take professor sander up on his comment about how he would withdraw his objections if more information was presented about, you know, what happens with a student with this background getting into the school. %$* 70
i take you up on that. %$* 70
now, in taking you up on that, which you have implicitly said i take it, is that actually with more information you are fine with affirmative action. %$* 70
and, in fact, in your comments you said over and over again, you're not really so much against affirmative action, you're just against excessive affirmative action. %$* 70
audience, i want you to be very attentive-- %$* 70
i want you to be very attentive to the disjunction within the side of my adversaries, because one speaker is totally against affirmative action and speaks in terms of laissez-faire, you know, "let the chips fall where they may-- %$* 70
" of course, we know where the chips will fall-- %$* 70
that is one speaker, that seems to be gail's position-- %$* 70
no, i-- %$* 68
gail's position-- %$* 70
gail's position seems to be, "let the chips fall where they may. %$* 70
no-- %$* 70
let's not have race be involved at all.” professor sander's position seems to be considerably different. %$* 70
his is more of, "well, there's too much affirmative action.” his is a tweaking position. %$* 70
all right. %$* 13
let me stop you because gail objects to your characterization of her position. %$* 13
actually i would be absolutely delighted if we just disclosed, because i think that would do a world of good. %$* 68
i would be very happy. %$* 68
i think that's a much better solution than waiting and having the debate go on for decades here. %$* 68
if we could-- %$* 68
if we could disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, i think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because i think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing. %$* 68
so if we could decide on behalf of every law school and every medical school to do that today, then, man, we're in business, and we might as well quit early and go out and have a beer. %$* 68
great. %$* 70
so we have-- %$* 70
we have affirmative action. %$* 70
you find that affirmative action just more disclosure? %$* 70
i'm satisfied with that debating for 20 years, you know. %$* 68
it's a good-- %$* 68
it's a good compromise if we actually could do it now. %$* 68
but i think actually if you paid attention to the mismatch literature, you're going to get more and more persuaded to our side. %$* 68
let me bring in-- %$* 13
let me bring in rick %$* 13
so, you know, i mean, it's not a bad thing if we end up agreeing by, you know, 7:00. if-- %$* 69
it's terrible for a debate, though. %$* 13
we're arguing that affirmative action does more harm than good, not that it has to do more harm than good. %$* 69
we're saying that if you fix it, it could work pretty well. %$* 69
and you started out basically acknowledging that you're against stupid affirmative action. %$* 69
so in a way the scope of the agreement, the debate here, is "what's stupid affirmative action? %$* 69
" and that goes to this issue about kind of, you know, what do we mean by preferences or what do we mean by affirmative action? %$* 69
i mean, i hear what you're saying, ted, that racial propositions is a loaded term, right? %$* 69
and i try not to use-- %$* 69
i think we use a bunch in my remarks-- %$* 69
the preferences received by legacies are much smaller on average than preferences based on race. %$* 69
excuse me. %$* 69
preferences received by women are virtually nonexistent. %$* 69
i mean, that's always been a big theme of affirmative action, that is that women are under the tent as well. %$* 69
but historically that has been very small. %$* 69
i mean, there have been important things in terms of trying to expand the path of access for women. %$* 69
but in terms of actual admissions preferences, that's been a-- %$* 69
it's been, essentially, a trivial phenomenon. %$* 69
and class has not been a significant subject of preferences, okay? %$* 69
the typical college gives something like 20 or 30 times the amount of weight to race as they do to class-- %$* 69
if they consider class at all. %$* 69
so, one of the reasons that race keeps popping up in the mismatch literature is because that's where the really large preferences are, and that's where the problem seems-- %$* 69
but your-- %$* 13
one of your of opponents stipulated that maybe you're right. %$* 13
maybe you're right, in terms of the dynamic you're describing in the mismatch-- %$* 13
but that even given that, the good outweighs the harm. %$* 13
their point being that the message that affirmative action sends is so enormous and powerful that not only do universities want to embrace it, regardless of even the fact that you're right. %$* 13
but even if that harm that you're describing is real. %$* 13
and i want to ask you, what's wrong with that formulation? %$* 13
why is the harm that you're describing-- %$* 13
that your side has stipulated to-- %$* 13
weigh heavier than that other good? %$* 13
because the pervasive tendency of selective institutions is to grossly go overboard. %$* 69
the focus of what schools do, the way that they set their goals is not based on how much of a preference should we use to maximize the width of the pipeline, to sort of maximize the aggregate beneficial social good? %$* 69
it's, how do i have enough cosmetic diversity in my entering freshman class so that i'm not going to get hassled? %$* 69
that's the way the university presidents are usually thinking about this. %$* 69
and that is totally the wrong question. %$* 69
they ought to be thinking about what the effects are. %$* 69
and so, because we're in this mindset where we're asking the wrong questions, or setting it up to do things that it's not well-engineered to do, we end up getting preferences that are whatever are needed to achieve those cosmetic goals. %$* 69
and it ends up causing more harm than good. %$* 69
in the overall scale of things, the-- %$* 13
if you look at-- %$* 69
okay. %$* 13
so the-- %$* 13
preferences of professional schools-- %$* 69
or at the top 200 select schools. %$* 69
okay. %$* 13
the reason i ask you is that to some degree, both sides have been slicing the salami here, but i want to put the salami together. %$* 13
and you're saying that your argument, the harm that you're describing overall, is-- %$* 13
causes-- %$* 13
as it's operating, causes more-- %$* 13
is more harmful than the large good that the other side is proposing. %$* 13
you're saying "yes.” so, i just want to bring-- %$* 13
if you look at-- %$* 69
if you look at three big things that keep coming up-- %$* 69
i-- %$* 13
i got to go to the other speakers-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 69
ted shaw. %$* 13
so, well, one thing, rick. %$* 71
i mean, i thought i heard you say that you got me-- %$* 71
and you didn't use the term "preference" very much. %$* 71
but then you went on to use it repeatedly. %$* 71
racial preference, right. %$* 69
right. %$* 71
okay. %$* 71
so, but be that as it may, we're talking about scholastic institutions in which african american students-- %$* 71
again, where most of this heat is being felt-- %$* 71
i think we've acknowledged that, right? %$* 71
we're talking about percentages of maybe three, four, five, low single digits in many of the institutions. %$* 71
you know, selective law schools, et cetera. %$* 71
it's a lot of fuss, given how few african americans exist at these institutions. %$* 71
now, having said that, the proposition is one that says that affirmative action does more harm than good. %$* 71
and if-- %$* 71
i mean, i find it strange that your study focuses on-- %$* 71
i mean, there's a point to be made, i suppose, but i'm not sure where it takes us. %$* 71
your study focuses on where the students change majors out of the sciences into something else. %$* 71
so what? %$* 71
lots of students change majors. %$* 71
you may say that black students may change at a higher rate of minority students, but that's not the end of the world. %$* 71
the reality in this country-- %$* 71
unfortunately, i became aware of this some time ago-- %$* 71
is that even if we look at graduation rates, generally speaking-- %$* 71
of all students-- %$* 71
they're not where most of us would like to see them be, you know? %$* 71
there are a lot of white students who change majors, who drop out, who don't finish. %$* 71
there are a lot of reasons that people may not finish in four or five years of college or take longer. %$* 71
some of them are economic, et cetera. %$* 71
there are a lot of variables, as you know, that are in play here. %$* 71
and some of them disproportionately may affect students of color-- %$* 71
who are disproportionately poor, for example, and come from different backgrounds. %$* 71
so, it's much more complicated. %$* 71
but the proposition that affirmative action does more harm than good is an extraordinary proposition, given the work that still remains in front of us, with respect to desegregating and integrating our institutions and american society, notwithstanding the age of obama. %$* 71
okay. %$* 13
i want to let gail let respond to that, because she hasn't had a chance to speak. %$* 13
and immediately after that, i want to start going to questions from the audience. %$* 13
and to remind you, just raise your hand, a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
stand up, state your name, ask a question. %$* 13
gail, go ahead. %$* 13
i guess i have a number of comments here. %$* 68
first of all, on the disclosure issue that we were talking about a little bit earlier, the u.s.commission on civil rights proposed that law schools disclose these issues. %$* 68
it must have been something like seven years ago. %$* 68
what happened? %$* 68
we got absolute deafening silence from the law schools. %$* 68
nobody was willing even to mention it. %$* 68
this was a nonstarter. %$* 68
i doubt very much that we can get law school deans to disclose this. %$* 68
but again, as a compromise matter, i would think that's pretty good if we could do that right now. %$* 68
otherwise i'd just like to convince you that the mismatch literature is in fact correct. %$* 68
i very much doubt that most people consider it more important to have more ivy league grads who are black than it is to have more black doctors, more black scientists, more-- %$* 68
more black engineers. %$* 68
i feel like i'm standing here with a key, and here is the key. %$* 68
here is how we can get many more black doctors, many more black engineers, many more black scientists, more black lawyers, more black college professors. %$* 68
and i just need someone to take that key and unlock the door. %$* 68
but it's hard. %$* 68
it's hard. %$* 68
okay. %$* 13
here we are. %$* 13
we have two-- %$* 13
i just want to do this for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we have two teams of two debating this motion: affirmative action on campus does more harm than good. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion, gail heriot and rick sander; on the side arguing against the moment-- %$* 13
the motion, randall kennedy and ted shaw. %$* 13
we are in the middle of the question-and- answer section. %$* 13
and tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org and on fora.tv. %$* 13
if you're watching on the live stream, we want to hear from you too, so send us your questions on twitter or facebook using the hash tag "affirmaction" so we don't miss it. %$* 13
and be sure to include your city, your state, your first name and your college if you're a student. %$* 13
so let's go to some questions. %$* 13
if you just raise your hand, i will find you. %$* 13
right down in front, sir. %$* 13
and just wait till the microphone reaches you. %$* 13
from your right side, it'll be coming in. %$* 13
if you can just tell us who you are so-- %$* 13
charles fried. %$* 18
and i'd like to ask two-- %$* 18
i'd like to ask two back-to-back, extremely short questions. %$* 18
i would like to ask-- %$* 18
you're so breaking our rule, but i'm going to give you a pass on that. %$* 13
i'm going to richard and gail what they think this country would look like today if, 40 years ago, and for the last 40 years, there had not been any affirmative action. %$* 18
and i'd like to ask randy and ted what this country will look like 40 and 50 years from now if we continue having affirmative action the same way we do now. %$* 18
rick sander. %$* 13
would you like to take it, gail? %$* 13
you started to speak. %$* 13
well, i guess i'd like to say something, and that is one thing i think that we-- %$* 68
i'll let you both answer that tersely and then the two of you as well. %$* 13
there'd be more black doctors, there'd be more black engineers, there'd be more black scientists and more black college professors if we did not use these very large preferences. %$* 68
again, we're not against outreach. %$* 68
we're very much for outreach. %$* 68
but the kind of preferences that are being practiced have been very much counterproductive. %$* 68
rick sander. %$* 13
i think that in the early years, in the 1960s and '70s, it was important to do whatever we could. %$* 69
we had to convince minorities that the doors that had been closed were now opening. %$* 69
so i would set aside that period. %$* 69
but if you want to see what would be the effect now or in recent decades, look at the effect of prop 209 in california. %$* 69
californians adopted a ban on the use of race in college admissions. %$* 69
the result of the university of california was a dip in-- %$* 69
a substantial dip in minority enrollments at the most elite schools, a temporary dip in black enrollment at uc as a whole. %$* 69
but within four or five years, the schools had launched enough outreach efforts to reverse that and to be above their pre-209 minority enrollment levels. %$* 69
in the meantime, students had cascaded to less elite institutions and they were completing science degrees at a much higher rate. %$* 69
they were graduating at a much higher rate. %$* 69
they were especially graduating in four years at a much higher rate. %$* 69
they had higher grades. %$* 69
so the overall effects of this quasi national experiment are resoundingly positive. %$* 69
all right. %$* 13
let me go to the other side. %$* 13
and your-- %$* 13
this is your chance not to rebut this but to respond to the question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 70
i think it was an excellent question from charles fried. %$* 70
and my response is that if we continue to have affirmative action as we presently have it, we will continue to see the further desegregation of strategic institutions in american life. %$* 70
the fact of the matter is that in institutions like the one we're situated in right now, in many other elite institutions in american life, we are just seeing-- %$* 70
we are just seeing the fruits of desegregation. %$* 70
we still have a long way to go. %$* 70
and i hope that affirmative action will continue, and it seems to me that in over the next half century, we will continue to see what we have been seeing for the past 40 or 50 years, which is a much fairer, a much better american life. %$* 70
so it does not-- %$* 70
i'm not bothered whatsoever by the prospect of a continuation of affirmative action as it is characteristically practiced now. %$* 70
and ted shaw. %$* 13
so, first, in order to answer that question, i think we'd have to have-- %$* 71
and i know you've been engaged in these discussions for a long time. %$* 71
we would have to have a discussion about the legal basis for affirmative action that exists now, you know, the remedial and the diversity legs. %$* 71
my hope would be that there would come a time, within the period that you identified, where it wouldn't be necessary to consciously put a thumb on the scale in order to achieve that kind of diversity. %$* 71
but with respect to the remedial leg which basically the supreme court has thrown under the bus, but nonetheless, the jurisprudence is so convoluted that we still have a subterranean discourse about that, that when race no longer is a cause for unearned privilege or unearned disadvantage at the moment of birth or through life, then i'd be more than happy to let it go, not to talk about it any more. %$* 71
i long for that day to come. %$* 71
all right. %$* 13
but we're not there. %$* 71
more questions? %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
can-- %$* 13
i'm not sure if any camera can find you. %$* 13
maybe if you came out to the center aisle. %$* 13

i beg to make the point that asian americans also face significant racism in society today, yet they're at an enormous disadvantage in gaining admission to highly selective colleges. %$* 72
so under affirmative action, do you believe that asian americans have an equal opportunity to succeed? %$* 72
could i ask you if you would be willing to rephrase that slightly differently and ask if under current policies asian americans are harmed? %$* 13
yes. %$* 72
would that work for you? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 72
i’d just like to plug it into our actual motion. %$* 13
do you believe that asian-americans are harmed under current affirmative action policies? %$* 72

it all depends on what sort of asian-americans we're talking about. %$* 70
i think that some asian-american groups, they may be harmed. %$* 70
so, for instance, japanese-americans, chinese-americans, i think actually face a somewhat different footing in the competition for admission to selective universities than people from other parts of asia, the mnong, filipinos, others. %$* 70
i think it's a complicated scenario. %$* 70
do you care? %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 70

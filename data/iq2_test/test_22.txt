just-- %$* 13
just-- %$* 13
go with your gut and get to your question. %$* 13
no. %$* 19
my question is-- %$* 19
with all the studies and all the evidence, and all the peer review-- %$* 19
my question is, what-- %$* 19
what evidence would you accept as sufficient to change your minds since peer review obviously isn't enough? %$* 19
that's a question. %$* 13
chuck benbrook. %$* 13
i would accept the battery of tests set out of by the codex alimentarius commission, which is the internationally recognized body that sort of sets the testing rules for animal drugs, for pesticides, and other things. %$* 58
there was a six-year negotiation involving countries from around the world that defined the set of studies that should be done on each new genetically engineered food. %$* 58
i think it was sound then. %$* 58
it's still sound. %$* 58
and not a single ge food on the market today has been subjected to the battery of studies called for by codex. %$* 58
all right. %$* 13
chuck, you've brought out something-- %$* 13
you brought out-- %$* 13
and certainly not on the new ge %$* 58
you brought out something we didn't know. %$* 13
and i want to hear your opponent's response to the fact that there is-- %$* 13
these are-- %$* 13
there's a set of standards that have been proposed for studying these that have not been used or addressed. %$* 13
you'll take it-- %$* 13
either-- %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 56
no, you take it. %$* 57
yeah. %$* 13
rob-- %$* 13
so, generally, there's not alignment on those studies. %$* 56
either their validity or their appropriateness for these types of products and there's not even recognition of that by the government agencies in this country. %$* 56
we comply to the laws of the united states and all the countries that we-- %$* 56
that, you know, import our crops. %$* 56
we are the breadbasket of the world. %$* 56
two-thirds of the corn ships around the world to europe, to asia, and to other countries. %$* 56
you're-- %$* 13
you know what? %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
and the standard for safety is %$* 56
have to stop you-- %$* 13
i have to stop you when you start going into talking points that you've repeated-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 56
endlessly. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 56
okay? %$* 13
because i want to-- %$* 13
i really want to understand the point that was made that there is-- %$* 13
that there is a set of standards which you said you don't consider valid. %$* 13
but is that-- %$* 13
is that because of the camp that you're in? %$* 13
is that because of the camp you're in? %$* 13
or is there actually a dispute about whether there are studies that could be done and for some reason are not being done? %$* 13
i'll take it to alison van eenennaam first. %$* 13
it's certainly not my area of expertise, but there are-- %$* 57
then i won't-- %$* 13
then i'll go to the other side. %$* 13
okay. %$* 57
unless you want to take it. %$* 13
well-- %$* 57
okay. %$* 57
unless you want to take it. %$* 13
i'm not trying to-- %$* 13
well, i guess, to me, it's, what are the unique risks that all these safety studies are for? %$* 57
we're talking about a breeding method. %$* 57
and the data shows that there's no unique risks. %$* 57
and so we've-- %$* 57
we already do extensive studies that cost millions of dollars to bring these products to market. %$* 57
if we're going to do more studies, it'll be even more expensive. %$* 57
and i want to know what the unique risks are that we're looking for-- %$* 57
okay. %$* 13
that are triggering these studies. %$* 57
a question that i would find interesting to come from the audience, and it does go to what rob was just talking about-- %$* 13
no, no, no, i'm serious, because i'd like-- %$* 13
rather have it come from you in this portion. %$* 13
but it does go to what rob's talking about, because one of his strongest points-- %$* 13
and it is the talking point that he's come back to-- %$* 13
is the impact of this technology on feeding the world and on solving problems. %$* 13
and i would like to explore that. %$* 13
and i was the one still asking the questions, that's where i would be going. %$* 13
so, would somebody please say what i want to say? %$* 13
i hope you do it now. %$* 13
my name's heather. %$* 19
and, yes, that's really what my question was about. %$* 19
it seems like we're always comparing the success rates of gmo farming to very chemically driven agriculture and not to an organic agriculture. %$* 19
and that's where i get very confused with the argument because the against side seems to be against the chemically driven agriculture, whether it's in gmos-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
or not. %$* 19
and is it viable to feed a world with organic farming? %$* 19
do we need-- %$* 13
do we need the technology to survive, basically is what you're asking. %$* 13
that's what part of the argument from the other side. %$* 13
i will-- %$* 13
let's let it go to this side first and then come back to you to-- %$* 13
as a rebuttal since you've made the point several times. %$* 13
you're good with that? %$* 13
who would like to take it? %$* 13
mardi. %$* 18
mardi mellon. %$* 13
first of all, the challenge of feeding the world's hungry people is not one that is met by production of any kind. %$* 59
i mean, if you want to feed hungry people around the world, i can give you a list of 10 things to do. %$* 59
you can build roads, you can raise their incomes, you can change the role of women, you can help people make their own decisions about what they want to grow, and help them grow it. %$* 59
so production itself is not an answer to the problems of hunger. %$* 59
but beyond that-- %$* 59
but beyond that, i want to say that, you know, that genetic engineering, as i tried to say in my original-- %$* 59
in my introductory remarks, is not really producing the kinds of traits that we need. %$* 59
now, there-- %$* 59
i will just refer to one study in nature magazine that was trying to help with a project. %$* 59
it started in 2010, trying to help african farmers develop corn crops that would grow on nitrogen poor soils. %$* 59
now, in that period of time, that project has been able to produce 21 conventionally bred varieties of corn, adapted around africa, that grow better in their nitrogen poor soils. %$* 59
genetic engineering, which was also used, has produced one. %$* 59
and they don't think it'll be ready for 10 years. %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
point made. %$* 13
let's let robert fraley respond. %$* 13
first of all, thanks for that. %$* 56
i was going to say that we might actually have reached-- %$* 56
reached some alignment. %$* 56
we've talked a lot about our differences. %$* 56
and one of the points i wanted to make-- %$* 56
you cited the national geographic. %$* 56
i give that same speech all the time. %$* 56
i absolutely believe that, you know, this is a complicated challenge, of feeding the world. %$* 56
it's going to take increased productivity and efficiencies, and that's clear, and that's where these tools come into play. %$* 56
it's also important that we reduce food waste. %$* 56
and, you know, there's things that we can do by protecting crops or providing refrigeration and diets. %$* 56
i absolutely agree. %$* 56
it's a complicated question that will take all the tools we have. %$* 56
and would you agree that we can't-- %$* 59
excuse me. %$* 56
let me-- %$* 56
use 40 percent of our corn for ethanol? %$* 59
can we-- %$* 56
we can address that if you want to. %$* 56
but let me just-- %$* 56
let me complete my thoughts. %$* 56
food security challenge is the biggest challenge we face. %$* 56
we have to double the available food in 36 years. %$* 56
it's important that we make the right decisions today. %$* 56
the other important point on farming-- %$* 56
and we've talked a lot about small farmers. %$* 56
my mentor was a guy named dr. %$* 56
norman borlaug. %$* 56
and norman always made the point that if you help a farmer, you help poverty. %$* 56
70 percent of the world's poor are farmers. %$* 56
if you give them better tools to farm even incrementally better, you address not only poverty, but you address food security. %$* 56
and so these are all complex interrelated issues. %$* 56
there are no simple solutions. %$* 56
but i think we should play the game with all of our tools. %$* 56
all right. %$* 13
i want to let-- %$* 13
i want to let charles, if you want to respond to that. %$* 13
but first, i need to say this: i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator, and we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: "genetically modify food." chuck benbrook. %$* 13
if you're persuaded that the argument from the biotech industry, that this technology is essential to feed the world, if this is what really grabs your interest in this, ask yourself this question: you have a 50-pound bag that you can get to a poor african farmer, trying to grow maize on worn-out soils. %$* 58
you can give that farmer a 50-pound bag of nitrogen fertilizer, or you can give him a 50- pound bag with smart stack corn. %$* 58
now, i think robb fraley would agree to me that african farmer's going to get a bigger boost out of the 50 pounds of nitrogen than out of his magic seeds. %$* 58
can-- %$* 57
can i-- %$* 57
alison, yes. %$* 13
alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
can i address that? %$* 57
i mean, i think that's a false balance. %$* 57
you know, i don't think we have to choose one or the other. %$* 57
and i think if you provide that farmer with an insect resistant crop like a bt, maybe then it's protected from insects and then also add some fertilizer, then maybe you can improve the yield sufficiently to feed his family and also sell some product and help lift himself out of poverty. %$* 57
so, i don't think we have to choose one or the other. %$* 57
i think that's a false balance. %$* 57
margaret mellon, do you want to respond? %$* 13
i don't think you have to choose one-- %$* 59
either one or the other, either. %$* 59
but i do think it's very important to kind of get the power of the technologies in perspective in order to make the right decisions about where to put our money going forward. %$* 59
and right now i think we have too much faith in genetic engineering, which as i said, has not-- %$* 59
it really hasn't proven itself except in one instance. %$* 59
so, i do think it's important that we face that. %$* 59
i also want to say how, you no he, we need to use all our tools. %$* 59
i want to give a shout-out to traditional breeding. %$* 59
i mean, since, or well before genetic engineering came on the scene, traditional breeders and agronomists were able to produce 1 to 2 percent a year increases in corn and soybean yields in this country for decades. %$* 59
it happened before biotech. %$* 59
all the way through the biotech era, we have continued to get 1 to 2 percent yields decade after decade. %$* 59
and we would continue to get them if we weren't using genetic engineering sometime in the future. %$* 59
so, we need to acknowledge how important that technology is. %$* 59
and it is not getting the attention that it deserves. %$* 59
i mean-- %$* 59
let's let alison van eenennaam respond to that. %$* 13
yes. %$* 57
let me take a quick response. %$* 56
all right, rob fraley. %$* 13
i had-- %$* 56
you know, we're dangerously close to common ground here. %$* 56
i absolutely believe everything you said. %$* 56
in fact, let me just tell you a little bit of a secret. %$* 56
you know, i run the research program for monsanto. %$* 56
we spend exactly twice as much of our research dollars on plant breeding as we do on biotech. %$* 56
absolutely plant breeding particularly assisted by these molecular tools has a great opportunity and has a huge impact internationally. %$* 56
we work with the gates foundation to use these tools to breed-- %$* 56
to breed drought resistant maize for africa, and we're working with them on other projects so i couldn't agree more. %$* 56
well, rob, one-- %$* 13
one part of-- %$* 13
i think of margaret's argument is that the focus on genetically engineered crops sort of sucks the oxygen out of the room and sort of integrates interest in more conventional methods, which she says would substitute perfectly well for genetic engineering. %$* 13
and i'd like either you or alison van eenennaam to respond. %$* 13
you know, i think the debate around gmo crops sucks all the air out of the room. %$* 56
i think we're to the point where it's become a side show. %$* 56
it's become a distraction. %$* 56
i know. %$* 13
but that doesn't answer the question. %$* 13
well, for example, we-- %$* 57
alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
wheat tends to be done by public breeders. %$* 57
and i know that the public breeders are using conventional selection and are basically locked out of using gm as a-- %$* 57
it's a synergistic tool. %$* 57
it can be used for very specific things like disease resistance much more effectively, potentially. %$* 57
and combining the two together would be a really beneficial thing. %$* 57
and so i just don't see it as being mutually exclusive. %$* 57
you have to do conventional breeding or genetic engineering. %$* 57
i agree with that, but i also-- %$* 59
i mean, every time i hear about what genetic engineering is going to do, i always remember the promises that i've been hearing for decades, many of which have never come to fruition. %$* 59
does anybody want to respond to that before i take one more question? %$* 13
because it's a point that was made earlier that was sort of left lying out there, that there was a lot of promise and a couple of tricks have been pulled off but not broadly in-- %$* 13
throughout agricultural. %$* 13
well, there are certainly products in the pipeline that have been delivered and things like the disease resistant papaya. %$* 57
and i guess as a public sector scientist i get a little bit frustrated by the same groups that are out there kind of scaremongering about the technology or at the same time saying, "why hasn't anything come to market? %$* 57
" because it's really that, that's stopping the public sector from developing these products. %$* 57
right down in front here. %$* 13
down one row, thanks. %$* 13
if you could stand, please. %$* 13
hi, i'm mike. %$* 18
so, we've seen that often when you use new genes they have some great uses and then after a couple of years they fade off. %$* 18
and maybe you come up with a new cocktail and try the same thing again. %$* 18
i'm wondering in the real scheme of time, as bill was getting at, are we going to run out of tricks and basically play into bugs' wildest dreams, create super strong bugs and run out of genes to fight them? %$* 18
a lot of cotton farmers in the southeast have devoted with their operations that aren't growing cotton anymore. %$* 58
they can't deal with the resistant weeds. %$* 58
there's three or four different glyphosate resistant weeds in a lot of the cotton acreage in the southeast. %$* 58
and there's grave concern in the midwest that the same fate will occur in the midwest where we-- %$* 58
you know, we grow all-- %$* 58
most of the corn and soybeans. %$* 58
corn and soybeans are the backbone of the u.s. food system, and if we have a weed-- %$* 58
resistant weed meltdown in the midwest it'll be a serious national problem. %$* 58
is it plausible? %$* 13
i'll go to rob fraley. %$* 13
we're on track we're on track. %$* 18
yes, we are. %$* 19
i mean, is there a bug apocalypse? %$* 13
could you restate the question? %$* 56
i really should. %$* 13
but his question was "are we going to come ultimately to a total meltdown where we would run out of tricks and where the bugs would win? %$* 13
i think only if we stop investing in the science in the future. %$* 56
you know, absolutely, you know, i've mentioned in my opening remarks, you know, concern over resistance development is a concern that's been a concern from the beginning of time. %$* 56
but we have incredible tools. %$* 56
i'm actually proud of the fact that we are developing our third and fourth generation technologies and staying ahead of the curve. %$* 56
and if we can move forward with the science and all of the tools-- %$* 56
i mean, we need to make the advances in breeding, we need to make the advances in biotechnology, tremendous opportunity for precision agricultural tools to farm more smartly, we're going to need all of these tools. %$* 56
we have to double the food supply in 36 years. %$* 56
what wakes me up in the morning is i know we can do it if we can reach alignment on moving forward and using the common ground. %$* 56
we all care about food security. %$* 56
we all care about the environment. %$* 56
let's get smart and move forward. %$* 56
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is "genetically modify food." and right after our closing round, which will be two-minute statements by each debater in turn, we will have a vote again. %$* 13
so, on to round three, round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and here to speak for the motion, alison van eenennaam, a genomics and biotechnology researcher in the department of animal science at uc davis. %$* 13
this past week the u.s.celebrated thanksgiving, a wonderful holiday, and we had 14 people over to our house. %$* 57
and as the hostess my task was to serve a safe delicious meal. %$* 57
you know the drill, keeping the raw turkey out of contact with food surfaces, making sure you cook it enough to get rid of food borne illness but not so much as to be dry, all while drinking a glass of wine which probably added to the risks. %$* 57
but actually food poisoning is a real risk, and 3,000 people a year die of food poisoning. %$* 57
as we gave thanks for this abundant cornucopia, the one risk i was not concerned about was whether any of the food was genetically modified. %$* 57
and i was serving this meal to the people i love most in the world, my dearest friends, my husband, my two teenage sons. %$* 57
their wellbeing is of paramount importance to me. %$* 57
and as a parent it's my responsibility to use the best possible information to protect their health and to determine what the scientific consensus is on technology. %$* 57
that is why my kids drink pasteurized milk and have had all of their childhood vaccinations. %$* 57
sometimes the risks that concern people and the risks that kill people are entirely different. %$* 57
for too long the debate over the merits of genetically modified food has focused on unrealized hypothetical risks and has been conflated with the use of pesticides. %$* 57
it has not addressed how gm could help with the very real risks faced by the hungry and malnourished. %$* 57
there are costs associated to excessive precaution. %$* 57
doing nothing is doing something. %$* 57
during the 90 minutes we've had this debate, approximately 1,500 people died of hunger, more than all of you here in this room. %$* 57
hunger and malnutrition are real risks, risks that kill over 20,000 people daily. %$* 57
and most of those who die are children. %$* 57
these are not talking points; they're people. %$* 57
as a mother and a scientist, what concerns me is the fear-mongering campaign against genetically-modified food has forced scientists from using this breeding method to help produce more nutritious and sustainable food sources for millions of people. %$* 57
vote yes for gm food. %$* 57
thank you, alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
and our motion is, genetically modify food. %$* 13
and here to give his closing statement against this motion, chuck benbrook. %$* 13
he is program leader of measure to manage farm and food diagnostics for sustainability and health. %$* 13
unfortunately, the way that the ge technology and crop revolution has unfolded, it's really turned into kind of an arms race with weeds, using herbicides as the sole hammer. %$* 58
and as a result, we've had this spread of resistant weeds. %$* 58
and also, the rapid-- %$* 58
especially in the last 10 years, escalation in the use of herbicides. %$* 58
there may have been 100 million pounds or so of insecticides not applied since 1996 because of bt corn and cotton, but there's been 6 or 700 million more pounds of herbicides. %$* 58
now, the word "pesticide" encompasses both herbicides and insecticides. %$* 58
so, if you've reduced insecticide use by 100 million pounds-- %$* 58
and that's a good thing-- %$* 58
but herbicide use has gone up by 600 million plus pounds, how do you come up with pesticide use going down? %$* 58
it's just not true. %$* 58
and a lot of farmers would take considerable exception to the claims from the other side of the die here about pesticide use going down, and their job being easier. %$* 58
in 1995, the year before the ge revolution, there was about 27 million pounds of glyphosate applied by farmers in american agriculture. %$* 58
10 years later, it had gone up to 157 million pounds. %$* 58
and in 2014, usda data shows pretty clear, it's about 230 million pounds of glyphosate was applied. %$* 58
we have about 300 million acres of cultivated croplands, so we're talking about two-thirds of a pound of glyphosate herbicide-- %$* 58
if it was spread evenly across the united states-- %$* 58
could be applied on every acre of cropland. %$* 58
that's why we've got glyphosate in our blood, in our hair. %$* 58
that's why we have-- %$* 58
the scientists are concerned, even though it's generally regarded as a relatively safe pesticide, there is reason for serious worry here. %$* 58
thank you. %$* 13
chuck benbrook. %$* 13
the motion, genetically modify food. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, robert fraley, executive vice president and chief technology officer at monsanto. %$* 13
thanks for a great debate and for listening to the commentary. %$* 56
i hope it's helped provide you more insight into the important science and the important tools that gmos represent. %$* 56
what i'd like to do is actually highlight what a vote against the motion really means, what it would be like to live in a world without gmo crops, what that would look like. %$* 56
first thing, there'd be a significant impact to the land. %$* 56
without gmos, farmers would need to dramatically increase their use of herbicides and insecticides. %$* 56
i estimate it to be about 100 million pounds added to the environment each year. %$* 56
second, since gmos improved yields and helped farmers deliver more food in their absence means we're going to have to farm more land. %$* 56
and you know, it's going to take about 120 million acres more land to just keep where we are today. %$* 56
that's about one california or four new york states. %$* 56
and the pressure that will put on will mean-- %$* 56
it will drain more wetlands, will cut down more forests. %$* 56
we'll look at more prairielands, because people will fundamentally eat. %$* 56
third, voting against the gmo technology really means exacerbating climate change, because it means we go backwards. %$* 56
we have to manufacture more chemicals. %$* 56
we have to take tractors and run up and down the fields and plow, and we release more greenhouse gas emissions. %$* 56
banning gmo crops is equivalent to taking and putting 26 million new cars on the road from a greenhouse perspective. %$* 56
it also means higher food prices. %$* 56
north carolina state just published a study showing that the average family going in-- %$* 56
not using gmo crops adds about $3,000 a year to their food bill. %$* 56
and that impacts everybody, and we all bear the cost of that. %$* 56
and finally, voting against gmos means forgoing all those opportunities that dr. %$* 56
van eenennaam had talked about. %$* 56
you know, it's a relatively new technology. %$* 56
the future is ahead of us. %$* 56
we're at the tip of the iceberg stage in what's possible. %$* 56
so, i hope, for the sake of all of our families-- %$* 56
and i hope for the sake of all the people on the planet-- %$* 56
that you vote to keep all of our options open and vote yes to support gm food. %$* 56
thank you. %$* 56
thank you, robert fraley. %$* 13
and the motion is: "genetically modify food" and here to summarize her position against the motion, margaret mellon, a science policy consultant and former senior scientist at the union of concerned scientists. %$* 13
you know, we really haven't heard a single piece of evidence tonight that supports the notion that somehow genetically engineered crops are important for helping hungry people eat. %$* 59
and i think that's really-- %$* 59
there is no evidence for that. %$* 59
if there is a consensus study out there, it's the world bank consensus study that ge crops are not important to solve food security problems. %$* 59
if you want to know what the world would look like without ge, you might want to look at europe. %$* 59
europe has an incredibly productive agriculture, so much so that they're all paying, you know, subsidies just like we're paying. %$* 59
they have a-- %$* 59
i would say they're still using too much in the way of herbicides and pesticides, but it's a very productive, safe and capable agriculture system that we would all be, i think, very comfortable to live in. %$* 59
we have to look at the fact that there are still safety concerns about this technology, particularly about the long term effects. %$* 59
and that's when the american cancer society says. %$* 59
yes, the current products are safe, but the long-term concerns are still out there. %$* 59
so, we can't pretend that those issues have been thrown away. %$* 59
i think we can say that since genetic engineering has been introduced, it has simply failed to address the big problems that are out there, the problems that are leading to dead zones in the gulf of mexico, but that there are technologies that can do that, and they are traditional breeding and agroecology, which have not gotten enough discussion, so-- %$* 59
margaret mellon, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
i urge you to vote against it. %$* 59
and that concludes round three of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued the best. %$* 13
we want you to go again to the key pads at your seat and vote a second time on this motion: "genetically modified food."if you side with this motion and with this team, push number one; with this-- %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
against the motion, and this team, push number two; and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and it'll take us normally about 90 seconds to get the final result. %$* 13
but while we're doing that, the first thing i want to say is this is obviously a very, very-- %$* 13
this is obviously a very, very passionate debate, and there are strong feelings on all sides. %$* 13
but even with that, i felt that the integrity and the civility the debaters brought to the stage, they lived up to the spirit of intelligence squared, so i congratulate you all for that. %$* 13
and everyone who raised his or her hand to ask a question and even the questions that i threw out, i respect you for getting up and asking them because it takes a lot of guts even if you have to read them. %$* 13
and congratulations to them for doing that. %$* 13
now, there's-- %$* 13
there's something new that i'm doing tonight. %$* 13
it's a one-time only thing, but as i mentioned, we have a podcast that goes out. %$* 13
and it turns out that there's a fan of intelligence squared named ryan everts who wrote to us and said that he and his girlfriend sort of court one another in part by listening to intelligence squared podcasts. %$* 13
and he wrote a very important note. %$* 13
he said, it was through-- %$* 13
"it helped my girlfriend and me to better engage with each other on fairly sensitive topics. %$* 13
it was through these episodes that we were able to discuss and learn more about each other's perspectives and opinions. %$* 13
though we disagree on some political issues, we understand one another and respect each other's views on a much deeper level." and he got that from listening to us. %$* 13
this is going to get-- %$* 13
this is going to go a little bit further. %$* 13
he contacted us because he's planning to propose marriage in about two weeks. %$* 13
and he asked me if i would record a mock debate motion about whether his girlfriend should marry him or not. %$* 13
so, with the acoustics of the room and with all of your presence and voices, i'm about to do that. %$* 13
he's out there listening right now on the live stream, making sure-- %$* 13
he's making sure that his girlfriend, nicole morris, is not listening, otherwise the whole thing is blown. %$* 13
and if anybody out there knows nicole morris, don't tell her about this. %$* 13
but here it goes: that sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: nicole morris, will you give ryan the honor of caring and loving you for the rest of your lives? %$* 13
and arguing for the motion, we have ryan everts. %$* 13
he was your neighbor back in oakland and now lives with you here in denver. %$* 13
ryan is deeply in love and would-- %$* 13
ryan is deeply in love and would love nothing more than to grow old together with you. %$* 13
so, i say to this audience, yes or no to this statement: should nicole morris say, "i do"? %$* 13
yes! %$* 18
all right, i'm going to-- %$* 13
thank you for that. %$* 13
that was lovely. %$* 13
so, one thing i want to do is i want to thank our generous supporters and donors who make these debates possible. %$* 13
the ticket sales don't come close to covering the cost of mounting these debates, so their-- %$* 13
their help is really appreciated by us. %$* 13
and as the holidays come up, i would encourage you to go to our website and make a donation at iq2us.org. %$* 13
our spring season is starting on thursday, january 15th. %$* 13
the motion will be "amazon is the reader's friend." we have-- %$* 13
we have some best-selling authors, including scott turow, joe konrath, franklin foer of the new republic and vox's matthew yglesias. %$* 13
they're debating whether amazon is good for readers and books. %$* 13
other topics we'll be covering this spring include "america's decline," "the right to be forgotten," "presidential war powers," "abolishing the death penalty" and whether "smart tech is making us dumb." for the full list of debates, you can go to our website. %$* 13
it's at iq2us.org. %$* 13
and as i mentioned before, you can download our app on apple and android mobile devices. %$* 13
iq2us, just look for that app. %$* 13
and on that app, you can get all of our debates and research et cetera. %$* 13
this was debate number 98.in february, we're going to hit 100.and we're delighted about that. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
all right, i now have the final results. %$* 13
you have voted twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and again, the numbers-- %$* 13
and again, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the first vote. %$* 13
in the first vote on the motion, genetically modified food, 32 percent agreed, 30 percent were against, 38 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember again, the team whose numbers change the most between first and second will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 60 percent. %$* 13
they went from 32 percent to 60 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 28 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
but let's look at the team against the motion. %$* 13
their first vote was 30 percent. %$* 13
second vote, only 31 percent, only a 1 percent move. %$* 13
that means the team arguing for the motion, "genetically modified food," has carried this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

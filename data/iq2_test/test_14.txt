it's enabled a type of iterative knowledge as well, in which ideas are put forward, and then iterated on in public. %$* 43
and this is actually a pretty new form of knowledge. %$* 43
it can be done at scale. %$* 43
the internet is enabling open access, which is the movement that-- %$* 43
the idea that scientific research and research in the humanities, academic research should be available for free to anybody online. %$* 43
this is peer-reviewed, but not put it into academic journals that can charge 20 or $25,000 for a subscription, which is driving our libraries into great despair. %$* 43
and so, this ecosystem that nick refers to, which i think is the right word, is in fact one that is extremely-- %$* 43
is enabling science to proceed, and research in general can proceed at tremendous pace and enabling it to get deeper and deeper and more and more complex. %$* 43
i just don't know the people, nick, who don't think deeply, who don't have a moment to think, who are distracted by their thumbs, that they don't-- %$* 43
who? %$* 43
i don't meet them. %$* 43
i see so much more deep thinking out in the world than i-- %$* 43
maybe we should ask for a show of hands for-- %$* 13
so two %$* 42
let me just say this. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator, and we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumbsir. %$* 13
folks, if you're upstairs raising your hands, i have to say i can't see you, so if you have a question, you might want to come downstairs. %$* 13
i would like to readdress-- %$* 18
and perhaps this is exceeding the scope of the argument about smart technology, the word they came up with. %$* 18
well, what about artificial intelligence? %$* 18
now siri is this automated discussion google robot. %$* 18
but, you know, i don't want to exceed the scope of the debate, but can we address artificial intelligence and how that might-- %$* 18
i will let you address artificial intelligence if you can really nail a question that-- %$* 13
right. %$* 18
think about it. %$* 13
i'll come back to you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
but seriously, it might be a great question. %$* 13
proposition. %$* 18
i didn't really have a-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
you're done? %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
so you got your 15 seconds in, huh? %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name's stacy. %$* 19
i wanted to address how parents use apps and smart devices to help make their children smarter. %$* 19
i know that my sister and my mom often will look to apps to fill in the gaps that they have in their knowledge. %$* 19
is that making us smarter or not? %$* 19
smart technology is making us dumb that sort of gets to the heart of the question, at least whether, in fact, these devices are extensions of our brains that support us or whether they are just things that are turning our brains into hard drives. %$* 13
i like the question. %$* 13
i want to take it to nick carr first. %$* 13
i think there's no question that if you need to get an answer to a well-defined question, that there's nothing so good as google or tweeting it out there or whatever. %$* 40
and again, that's one of the good things about the technology. %$* 40
but deep thought in the-- %$* 40
and i'm back to this again. %$* 40
deep intelligence isn't about getting precise answers to well-defined questions. %$* 40
it's being able to know, what are the big questions you should ask? %$* 40
how do you fit this information together to form conceptual knowledge, to get big-picture knowledge? %$* 40
and if you spend all your time googling and grabbing information, you might think you're smart. %$* 40
in fact, there was a very interesting study that came out just a couple of months ago that-- %$* 40
that showed that people tend to think they're smarter because they're googling all the time, and they confuse what's on google with what's in their own brains. %$* 40
and as one of the researchers said, we have this weird-- %$* 40
we're in this weird time where we seem to be getting dumber, but we are thinking that we're smarter. %$* 40
and that's kind of the illusion that this-- %$* 40
being wrapped in this information often provides. %$* 40
but, you know, we have to make that distinction between getting quick answers from wikipedia maybe, or from google or whatever, and being smarter. %$* 40
and i don't think they're the same thing. %$* 40
genevieve or david. %$* 13
so, listen, i mean, nick, i think it's interesting, right. %$* 42
you’ll concede to the notion that a well- formed question is an appropriate way to engage with a piece of technology. %$* 42
i'd sort of suggest that being able to form a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, right, being able to work out what the information is you want to extract and find the app that does it suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness. %$* 42
i mean, i think it's coming back to this for me, right, is how are you framing "dumb" and it's opposition and what that means, right. %$* 42
if you're a new mom trying to work out, is this not sleeping thing a good thing or a bad thing, and when do a worry? %$* 42
those are questions that technology may be able to save you quicker than calling your own parent because she's in a different country. %$* 42
is that about making you more dumb? %$* 42
i don't think so. %$* 42
so there's something for me again about how we are framing the notion of dumbness and its opposition that i keep coming back to, right. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb david, hold up one second. %$* 13
i want another response to come from the other side. %$* 13
nick. %$* 13
let's look at the question of how well we-- %$* 40
how well formed our questions are. %$* 40
there's an interesting interview just recently with a top search engineer at google. %$* 40
and he was going through how much better the search engine has gotten in anticipating what we need and stuff. %$* 40
and the interviewer said, "so i assume that as the-- %$* 40
as google search engine has gotten smarter, people's questions have also gotten smarter.” and he said-- %$* 40
he laughed and said, "no, it's exactly the opposite. %$* 40
people get lazier and lazier.” and this shows how we become dependent on the technology to do our thinking for us. %$* 40
and as a result, we get lazy, we fall victim to what scientists call automation complacency. %$* 40
you just simply think, let the machine do it for us. %$* 40
so even the formation of questions, we seem to be getting worse and worse as the searching gets better and better. %$* 40
david weinberger. %$* 13
so-- %$* 43
as i understand it, nick, what's actually going on with the searches is that they've gotten much longer. %$* 43
people actually type, "what is-- %$* 43
" you know, the whole question with the question mark at the end, because that now works. %$* 43
whereas before, the well-- %$* 43
forming a question well with google meant figuring out what were the terms that google wanted that would give you back the right results. %$* 43
it wasn't about good question forming, it was about being-- %$* 43
it was google knowledge, you know, knowing how google worked. %$* 43
but i think that your comments about people googling and they think that they're smart is that you're actually, i think, repeating socrates' mistake which is, you know, really good company to be in. %$* 43
but in the phaedrus i'm sure you know this is in the phaedrus socrates makes a terrible mistake, doesn't make a lot-- %$* 43
a terrible mistake. %$* 43
he's wondering about the smart tech of his time, which was writing things down. %$* 43
it was literacy. %$* 43
and he said, "this is terrible because our memory will fail. %$* 43
we'll get much worse at remembering things.” and he was absolutely right about that, because if anybody here would like to stand up and recite "the illiad" by heart, please do so and show me wrong. %$* 43
but generally, our memory has gotten much smaller than it - - than it was. %$* 43
so he was right about that, but he was wrong about the effect of literacy. %$* 43
the smart technology is making us dumb effect of literacy has in fact made our memory a thousand times better. %$* 43
we know so-- %$* 43
we remember so much more as a species. %$* 43
andrew keen. %$* 13
but that wasn’t nick’s point. %$* 41
i think just to speak-- %$* 41
no, but you're the one who brought up socrates, right? %$* 41
and so i can bring him up too. %$* 41
i was making a point, though, so-- %$* 43
well, no, but you brought socrates up, so i'm going to-- %$* 41
i'm going to – i'm going to bring him up too. %$* 41
so what was-- %$* 41
socrates is great, his contribution. %$* 41
nick was just saying that while the problems with google or our search-centric culture is people are increasingly lazy. %$* 41
and what they're really lazy about is asking questions. %$* 41
what we're having is the automation of the act of asking a question. %$* 41
and that is one of the consequences or casualties of this digital revolution. %$* 41
and, of course, socrates' greatest-- %$* 41
one of his greatest contributions to our culture was in the art of asking the question. %$* 41
that was the whole point of his philosophy, was it was about asking questions. %$* 41
that's what knowledge was, asking questions. %$* 41
and as nick has made it clear, we have forgotten, or we are forgetting how to ask questions, and that's extremely troubling. %$* 41
david weinberger. %$* 13
so the other criticism-- %$* 43
the other criticism or fear that socrates had in that dialogue about writing was that written stuff is never as good as in person, face to face, because the written thing will not respond to you. %$* 43
you can't ask it a question. %$* 43
and the internet is not a series of answers. %$* 43
it's a series of conversations of various forms. %$* 43
and now we are able to engage in conversations about any topic, whether it's about epistemological chaos, or it's about whether smart technology is making us dumb a mini cooper is any good in the winter in boston. %$* 43
and we can talk about other people, and we can get answers. %$* 43
this is a far more interactive and responsive medium than we've had before, except in person conversation. %$* 43
i think we're going to have time for one more question. %$* 13
i'm just curious myself, as this debate has proceeded before you, has anybody been multitasking in any form? %$* 13
yeah? %$* 13
some hands have gone up. %$* 13
they all have. %$* 18
you missed an amazing debate. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name's devina i have a question about cuba. %$* 19
i was there a little over a year ago, and-- %$* 19
i just want to warn you, this has to really zoom in very quickly. %$* 13
wait. %$* 19
the question is this: the cubans, for the last over 50 years have not had access to almost any technology, and they've been living in a way where they are-- %$* 19
the fiber optic cables are built around cuba. %$* 19
they're not-- %$* 19
they're not-- %$* 19
and when i was there, we were in a lot of bars and-- %$* 19
okay, i-- %$* 13
but there wasn't wise-- %$* 19
there wasn't this wise thought and i'm wondering what-- %$* 19
are you disappointed with humans, or do you think that in the absence of technology people are just sitting around and like thinking about what's the meaning of life or-- %$* 19
you know, they want technology. %$* 19
like, they're talking about so-- %$* 19
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 19
okay, that is a great question. %$* 13
that's really good. %$* 13
actually was great. %$* 13
i'll take it to nick carr. %$* 13
there is-- %$* 40
i'm not-- %$* 40
i'm certainly not arguing against technology. %$* 40
technology is books, technology are the good things we can do with computers, the way computers can help us do things. %$* 40
what i'm arguing about is how we think today, thanks to our dependency on our smartphones and our computers and our dependency on social media, and looking at the evidence. %$* 40
and the evidence is-- %$* 40
and you can certainly understand why people who are cut out from the technology would want in, but that doesn't change the fact of how we actually use the technology and how we behave with it, and how it influences our thinking. %$* 40
and the studies and the research and the science points to the fact that we are, in fact, turning into scatterbrains. %$* 40
and, you know, it may well be that cuba will get all of this technology, and they'll enjoy many benefits from it, but they'll probably have this same debate there in 10 years or 15 years or whatever, because they'll realize that there's a lot that's lost as well as what's gained. %$* 40
okay, let me-- %$* 13
again, i like the question a lot. %$* 13
let me bring it to genevieve bell. %$* 13
well, there's something kind of extraordinary in the notion that it's good for people to want in but only if they want in on your terms. %$* 42
i mean, it's sort of something you have to think about what-- %$* 42
i don’t think i said that. %$* 40
yeah, actually he didn't really say that. %$* 13
no, but there's sort of that-- %$* 42
well, no, i know, but it was close. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb they could want the technology, but they shouldn't want it compulsively. %$* 42
i mean, i think there's sort of something interesting lurking underneath with that. %$* 42
no, he didn't say that, either. %$* 13
really? %$* 42
he said that, "of course they want the-- %$* 13
of course they want it," but maybe the same thing's going to happen there that he feels has happened here. %$* 13
which is about-- %$* 42
what was the phrase you used-- %$* 42
if i'm going to attempt to get it right now-- %$* 42
it's "compulsive," right, that the compulsiveness of the technology-- %$* 42
compulsive obsessive-- %$* 18
nature-- %$* 42
gathering of information. %$* 18
of our relationship to a particular set of technology is preventing kind of these deeper thoughts. %$* 42
i guess the question is-- %$* 42
and i would had to use cuba as a kind of, you know, example, as a kind of laboratory experiment-- %$* 42
but if you were, what is the-- %$* 42
kind of the vision you then have about what the right use of it is? %$* 42
what's the right use of technology if the one we have now isn't it? %$* 42
we can use technology in all sorts of ways, and there's nothing wrong with going on facebook to see what your friends are up to, to arrange doing things. %$* 40
my vision, my point would be that actually what we've done is created this technological environment, both because of the interests of companies like google and facebook and intel, to get us to be constantly interacting with our computer screens, constantly distracted and interrupted, and also because smart technology is making us dumb we have inside our brains this primitive desire, well-documented, to want to know everything that's going on around us, probably because it helped save your life, you know, eons ago. %$* 40
but we combine this commercial desire to keep people distracted with our own kind of proclivity to want to be distracted. %$* 40
and what that does is it makes it harder and harder for us to do something that's always been hard, which is to concentrate and be attentive and think deeply. %$* 40
david, do you want to respond? %$* 13
so you say, nick, that-- %$* 43
i still don't know the answer to the question, though. %$* 43
i mean, you're not against technology, it's just what happens when you use technology. %$* 43
we seem to get-- %$* 43
well, that's what we're debating. %$* 40
no, i-- %$* 43
i'm seriously curious, nick, what you would recommend to cuba as a policy, trying to avoid these terrible effects and only get the good uses that you have specified-- %$* 43
what you would recommend to cuba as a company-- %$* 43
as a-- %$* 43
excuse me, as a country for a policy or to any user in the room, what it is that we should be doing in order to get the benefits of this computer based tech but not fall victim to the danger of being unable to think thoughts again. %$* 43
well, i'd be worried about putting it into the hands of cuba's government or any government determining how we use technology or how we use information. %$* 40
so i would-- %$* 40
okay, push that to the side. %$* 40
i would say that what we-- %$* 40
everything we know about it is that we should use it less-- %$* 40
that concludes-- %$* 13
and what you use it for. %$* 40
smart technology is making us dumb %$* 40
that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "smart technology is making us dumb.” thank you for that cuba question. %$* 13
that was-- %$* 13
thank you for persisting because it really got to an interesting place. %$* 13
so now we move on to round three. %$* 13
round three are closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the arguments began because as soon as this is concluded we're going to have you vote again, and then we'll have the results of your choice of-- %$* 13
your decision on which side was most persuasive. %$* 13
so round three, closing statements, first here summarizing his position in support of the motion, "smart technology is making us dumb," here is andrew keen, author of, "the internet is not the answer." %$* 13
well, you can't have a debate like this without again ending with socrates and plato, since we're supposed to be talking about dumbness and intelligence. %$* 41
you remember, or most of you should remember, in plato's "republic," socrates' definition of intelligence was bound up in his notion of the cave and of being able to distinguish illusion from truth. %$* 41
and his argument in the "republic" was that we were mostly looking at shadows in his cave. %$* 41
and going from socrates and plato back to david, let me quote him. %$* 41
he said, "the internet is giving us the idea of freedom.” let me repeat that. %$* 41
the internet is giving us the idea of freedom. %$* 41
and i agree with him. %$* 41
it is giving us the idea of freedom. %$* 41
and he says that's empowering. %$* 41
but look at our world. %$* 41
we're not empowered. %$* 41
it is, of course, the classic manifestation, perhaps in digital terms, of plato or socrates's cave, where we think we're empowered. %$* 41
we think, by making statements about politics, or economics, or supposedly bringing down some powerful figure, we think we're free. %$* 41
we think we're empowered. %$* 41
but this is the ultimate-- %$* 41
to borrow another philosophical term-- %$* 41
this is the ultimate manifestation of false consciousness. %$* 41
we're living in a world where we think we're empowered. %$* 41
we're living in the world where the idea of freedom has essentially been digitalized, and commodified, and sold to us-- %$* 41
or perhaps not sold because it's a supposedly free economy. %$* 41
but the truth is, in this world, we are more and more-- %$* 41
i don’t know about the word dumb. %$* 41
smart technology is making us dumbwe are less and less aware of our reality. %$* 41
we think we're empowered. %$* 41
we think we're free. %$* 41
and-- %$* 41
andrew keen, i'm sorry. %$* 13
actually, we’re living in the cave. %$* 41
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
andrew keen. %$* 13
the motion, smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, david weinberger, senior researcher at harvard's berkman center for internet and society. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 43
this has been really-- %$* 43
has been great. %$* 43
but i listened to your arguments, and i come back to the fact that, even if you're right about everything you said, i think it's undeniable that this is the greatest time in human history to be wanting to know. %$* 43
there is no better time. %$* 43
the access to information has never been this free. %$* 43
everybody-- %$* 43
you don't have to be at a major university to get access to a wide range. %$* 43
the ability to engage-- %$* 43
not just read, and not to-- %$* 43
not even just to explore, to follow your interests where they go, by following links, and finding people who know things that you don't, and being guided to sources that you care about, that you didn't know existed, the discovery of knowledge and information in the world. %$* 43
we've never had an opportunity like this. %$* 43
we have never had it. %$* 43
and the ability to participate in the creation of knowledge, whether this is by asking questions-- %$* 43
dumb questions, smart questions-- %$* 43
by posing wrong ideas and bad ideas and finding how the world reacts, by participating in a more genuine way and learning from people, by lurking on lists and seeing what people are saying-- %$* 43
where lurking means watching but not talking; it's not the bad lurking. %$* 43
we've never had to take a-- %$* 43
course at a major university for free, to read open access journals, where most of the best physics in the world, the best math in the world is being done. %$* 43
to think that this is not the smart technology is making us dumb greatest age to be-- %$* 43
to want to know things strikes me as crazy, as crazy. %$* 43
no matter what facts you point at, and brain chemistry, et cetera-- %$* 43
all i-- %$* 43
well, none of which i deny. %$* 43
nevertheless, if the question is, is smart technology making us dumb, i think, just looking at what is there should tell us no. %$* 43
this is the smartest age we've ever had. %$* 43
thank you, david weinberger. %$* 13
and the motion is smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, nick carr. %$* 13
author of "the glass cage: automation and us." %$* 13
unfortunately, david, the science happens to be against you here. %$* 40
but we've been speaking mainly about communications and information. %$* 40
and i think that's a very important part of-- %$* 40
about smart technology, but it's not everything. %$* 40
what we're seeing now is we're relying on software, relying on algorithms to do more and more things. %$* 40
not just to gather information, but if you're a pilot, you use them to fly. %$* 40
if you're a doctor, you use them for diagnosis. %$* 40
if you're just an average person, you turn on google maps to get around. %$* 40
and we want to believe that this-- %$* 40
by handing over tasks to our computers, we'll be raised up. %$* 40
we'll-- %$* 40
our own talents will get sharper and better. %$* 40
but even here, the research points to something very different happening. %$* 40
there was a fascinating study done in the netherlands, a series of experiments, where people were given increasingly smart software to do difficult tasks. %$* 40
and what the researchers found is that as the software got smarter, the people got dumber. %$* 40
they got lazier. %$* 40
they began to become reliant on the software itself. %$* 40
they weren't practicing their own talents. %$* 40
and we can see this as well in all of those examples i talked about. %$* 40
david mentioned, well, aren't pilots-- %$* 40
shouldn't pilots have the smartest technology possible? %$* 40
actually, if you look at airline safety research, and if you look at the recent proclamations from the faa, they're saying that over automation is actually making pilots less capable. %$* 40
and we have to remove some of the dependency on computers. %$* 40
you see this as well with accountants who become overly dependent on their software and lose the sharpness of their thinking. %$* 40
you see it with doctors who become dependent on the templates that they go through when you're in the examination room. %$* 40
i talked about how the google person saw this smart technology is making us dumb with search as well. %$* 40
another google top engineer put the-- %$* 40
put the problem very bluntly in an article. %$* 40
he wrote, "sharp tools, dull minds." %$* 40
nick carr, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is "smart technology is making us dumb.” and here to summarize her position against this motion, genevieve bell, vice president of the corporate strategy at intel. %$* 13
so the proposition, "smart technology is making us dumb," it's clearly one that seduces many of you in this room. %$* 42
i watch you applaud, i watch you nod, and i know that there's an echo in it. %$* 42
there's something in it that always appeals. %$* 42
we say the same thing about many technologies over the last 200 years. %$* 42
and i want to make us think for just a moment here about what is that seduction? %$* 42
what is the anxiety that is appealed to when you applaud the notion that this technology is making us dumb? %$* 42
because at beginning of this debate, most of you raised your hands that you had smart technology in your lives. %$* 42
those of you who don't own it know people who do and live in worlds that are augmented by it. %$* 42
when you ask if anyone in the room was willing to admit to feeling dumber about it, there were only two of you who actually raised your hand. %$* 42
that makes me suspect that the number of you in the room who feel it, it's why you applaud, but you wouldn't say you did feel dumber because of it. %$* 42
my suspicion is that threading through all of that is a very human set of preoccupations and anxieties, an anxiety about what technology means for us, what it means for our humanity, our bodies, our competency, what it means to have new technologies in some ways threaten some of those things. %$* 42
but the reality is also, despite nick's, in some ways, admiral notion that we should just use it less, that there is more and more technology in our lives, technology that we rely on, technology that some of us love, technology that many of us find valuable and useful and instructive, that helps shape our exercise, our financial futures, that we use for banking and travel and leisure activities. %$* 42
and there's something in all of this about why it is that despite all of that, we like to imagine we are more dumb. %$* 42
i find it hard to imagine, sitting in a room full of new yorkers that you secretly in your heart of hearts believe you are dumb. %$* 42
smart technology is making us dumb i may be foreign to this country, but i'm not foreign to the idea of what new york stands for. %$* 42
likewise to a radio listening audience who will feel the same thing. %$* 42
so it strikes me that it's very hard to imagine that smart technology is really making all of us dumb. %$* 42
thank you, genevieve bell. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best here. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to go again to the key pads at your seats and vote a second time after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
again, the motion is this: smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
press number one if you agree with this motion now. %$* 13
press number two if you disagree with this motion now, or press number three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in about two minutes. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i want to get your attention back, please. %$* 13
may i have your attention? %$* 13
may i have your attention, please? %$* 13
hello! %$* 13
hello. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thanks i wanted your attention while the-- %$* 13
while the results are being tabulated because i really wanted to say a couple of things about-- %$* 13
first of all about the audience questions tonight which were terrific. %$* 13
and it's not always true. %$* 13
they're all-- %$* 13
they all really moved this debate to great places, so thank you, everybody, who asked a question. %$* 13
and i also want to commend the debaters. %$* 13
they obviously feel very passionately about this. %$* 13
but there was a good deal of intellectual honesty and respect on both sides. %$* 13
and they just made it darn interesting for all of us. %$* 13
so thank you for what you brought. %$* 13
i also want to thank the generous donors who make these debates possible. %$* 13
the ticket prices do not come anywhere close to covering the cost of putting on these debates. %$* 13
we are a nonprofit, and so we would really encourage you to visit our website, iq2us.org to make a donation to keep this going and help us to grow to even more debates in the future. %$* 13
and speaking of more debates in the future, our next one is going to be here at the kaufman center on may 26th. %$* 13
the motion is "obama's iran deal is good for america.” among our smart technology is making us dumb debaters, we're going to have a former special assistant to the president and white house coordinater for the middle east, who just stepped down from the administration. %$* 13
next month, we're going to be in philadelphia again at the national constitution center where we have been staging a series of debates that take an absolutely constitutional approach-- %$* 13
issues to a very constitutional framework. %$* 13
and in this case, we're looking at the issue of whether same-sex couples have the right to marry. %$* 13
so on june 2nd, the motion will be "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.”for the full list of our debates and to purchase tickets you can go to-- %$* 13
again, to our website. %$* 13
and finally, i mentioned this before, but i just want to mention it again, that this evening will live on infinitely and digitally through that-- %$* 13
that place they've all been talking about here tonight. %$* 13
and it-- %$* 13
and you can download all of our debates, including this one, through the apple and android mobile stores where we have a really lovely-- %$* 13
a lovely app. %$* 13
all of our debates, in both video and audio, are available there. %$* 13
and you can learn about upcoming debates and buy tickets. %$* 13
and it's a smart app, i need to point out. %$* 13
and you can watch the live stream on iq2us.org, et cetera. %$* 13
so, i have the final results now. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
let's remind you that the motion was "smart tech-- %$* 13
" that the motion is, "smart technology is making us dumb.” and again, it's the difference between the two votes, before and after, that determine our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the first vote. %$* 13
smart technology is making us dumb. %$* 13
37 percent agreed, 33 percent were against, and 30 percent were undecided. %$* 13
kind of a three-way split. %$* 13
let's take a look at the second vote. %$* 13
again, we're looking for the difference. %$* 13
the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 47 percent, from 37 to 47 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 10 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see the team against the motion. %$* 13
their first vote was 33 percent. %$* 13
their second was 43 percent. %$* 13
they also pulled in 10 percent. %$* 13
it is an intelligence squared first. %$* 13
it is a tie. %$* 13
congratulations to both teams, all four of our debaters. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

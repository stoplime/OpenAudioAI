surely all of us can agree, that schools should be required to publish graduation rates and grade distributions, and yes, persistence in majors, broken down according to the different preferences granted, and that means all of them, including racial preferences, alumni preferences and athletic preferences, the problem is the same in all cases. %$* 38
but more fundamentally, we need to ask ourselves why we tolerate the systematic use of race preferences. %$* 38
every supreme court precedent in this area’s held that racial preferences are a last resort. %$* 38
yet schools continue to treat preferences— %$* 38
—as a sacred cow— %$* 38
—they must defend to the death. %$* 38
thank you. %$* 38
one. %$* 33
—or two institutions that use preferences in a handful of deserving cases. %$* 38
what we’re dealing with, the problem that we’ve got, is the systematic use of racial preferences by every single institution of higher education in the country. %$* 38
i’ve used my time to focus on one specific problem in some detail, but a growing body of research shows similar effects in many other areas. %$* 38
surely all of us can agree, that schools should be required to publish graduation rates and grade distributions, and yes, persistence in majors, broken down according to the different preferences granted, and that means all of them, including racial preferences, alumni preferences and athletic preferences, the problem is the same in all cases. %$* 38
but more fundamentally, we need to ask ourselves why we tolerate the systematic use of race preferences. %$* 38
every supreme court precedent in this area’s held that racial preferences are a last resort. %$* 38
yet schools continue to treat preferences— %$* 38
thank you— %$* 33
—as a sacred cow— %$* 38
—terence pell— %$* 33
—they must defend to the death. %$* 38
thank you. %$* 38
thank you %$* 33
terence pell, uh, speaking in favor of the motion, now, uh, to give the last of the opening statements against the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action,” kimberlé crenshaw. %$* 33
hi. %$* 39
i’m kim, and i am a beneficiary of affirmative action. %$* 39
despite what our opponents want you to think, americans continue to support african-american for women and for people of color. %$* 39
when the precise question of eliminating affirmative action was put to voters in houston, texas, the majority repudiated this radical agenda. %$* 39
in supporting affirmative action americans inherently know that while it is one thing to pull down those “no trespass” signs, it is another task altogether, to build pathways to and through our institutions, that are genuinely and visibly open to all. %$* 39
this continuing support of affirmative action is even more remarkable, given how the media, and lukewarm supporters, have acquiesced to the terms of the debate that have been set by well-funded, think tank-produced critics. %$* 39
think for just a moment about what is missing in the way that affirmative action is usually framed. %$* 39
the debate is usually premised on the metaphor of an equal-opportunity race, where we all began at the starting line. %$* 39
the societal rewards go to the swiftest and the most talented. %$* 39
now the problem with affirmative action as we are led to believe, is that it distorts the race by giving some people a head start, halfway around the track. %$* 39
so when the winner is a woman, or a person of color, or for goodness sakes, a woman of color, supposedly we all know that it isn’t because she was the swiftest runner, or thinker, or planner, but because of the head start that she happened to get. %$* 39
now, some supporters of affirmative action will agree that the runner got a head start, but will justify the head start in terms of a diverse society. %$* 39
now, don’t get me wrong, i’m all for diversity, it’s the language of inclusion used by the military, by corporate america, virtually all colleges and universities and yes, by the supreme court too. %$* 39
these are good allies to have on our side and on this one, they’re firmly with us. %$* 39
but while all sides of this debate focus on the disabilities of the runner, they wind up missing entirely the crippling conditions of the track. %$* 39
so what if instead of training our gaze at the runner, we looked instead at the conditions of the track. %$* 39
what if we really looked at the different lanes that america’s runners have to run in. %$* 39
if we looked at that we see that some of those lanes are nicely paved, even surfaces, beautifully well-lit with freshly painted lines. %$* 39
other americans though have to navigate lanes that are riddled with obstacles and debris, where to stay in the race they have to climb walls, scale barriers, cross over craters, avoid detours, and confront a host of conditions that others never face, just in order to even see the finish line. %$* 39
affirmative action is quite simply a commitment to remove the effects of these obstacles that impede the race for some, using a wide variety of tactics and strategies, now, the other side will riddle us with language about, um, preferences— they’ll talk about racial preferences, they won’t talk about gender preferences—as a way to get you to forget what you know about the track, and to focus instead of what you think you know about the runners. %$* 39
now, there’s a wealth of information that gives content to the obstacles, that run a full gamut from traditional discrimination employment, where blacks with a high school diploma, actually, actually lose out in the competition to whites with a criminal record. %$* 39
and where the same resume %$* 39
receives 50 percent fewer white, uh, call-backs than black-sounding names do. %$* 39
to underfunded schools, school districts with the highest concentration of black students receive the lowest share of resources, and the prison to, uh, the school-to-prison pipeline where kids as young as six are handcuffed, and set on a fast track to prison, rather than a highway to college. %$* 39
to hyper- segregation that isolates minorities from key social networks through which most job-seekers actually find employment, to newer evidence about stereotype threat that makes gifted students unperfor—underperform on high-stakes tests, to implicit bias that unconsciously shapes people’s attitudes, and their behaviors towards minorities. %$* 39
that makes cops think they see a gun instead of a wallet. %$* 39
that makes teachers think they see an imbecile instead of a hungry child. %$* 39
that makes men think they see a ball-busting diva rather than a high-performing managerthat makes high-per—highway patrollers think that they see traffickers transporting drugs rather than a high school basketball team celebrating a nail-clinching victory. %$* 39
this evidence from disciplines as diverse as sociology, economics, law, com—cognitive science, reflects just the barest summary of the conditions that are out there. %$* 39
modest efforts to build bridges and patches over these obstacles, are not preferences. %$* 39
they are corrections to ensure equal opportunity. %$* 39
now, to be sure, there are preferences that are up there. %$* 39
and they are dangerous and obsolete, i’m talking about the preferences for wealth, for legacies, for power, for social networking, preferences that permit this privileged and lucky cohort to simply show up at the race to win, they don’t have to run, they don’t have to work hard, no one scolds them or their families or their communities about discipline, and they don’t have to break a sweat. %$* 39
let’s take the guy up there on the people mover. %$* 39
through his family’s money, his daddy’s connections, a bunch of good old boy backers, a society trained to look the other way, this guy can get a c average at yale, enjoy a undistinguished record at harvard b school and in due course simply lean over to the finish line, to receive the most coveted job in the country. %$* 39
if there is a poster boy against real preferences, who better than george bush. %$* 39
but now, how is it that this colossal preference that attends to the privilege is overlooked, i call it, look, it’s a black-man strategy. %$* 39
look at this, check this out. %$* 39
now. %$* 39
this cover appeared on newsweek during the controversy over affirmative action at the university of michigan, “affirmative action—10 ways to think about it now.” now, let’s think about this picture for a minute, what are at least three ways that we’re told we’re supposed to think about affirmative action. %$* 39
it’s important for you to know that newsweek was communicating a message here. %$* 39
this person wasn’t a student involved in michigan, he was a model, he was photographed, many times with various attire, to arrive at the picture that showed the message that newsweek wanted you to know. %$* 39
as janine jacks reported in her study of affirmative action, “media coverage routinely focuses on race not gender, on blacks not other people of color, on elites not people of color from all classes and genders.” white women are the single largest group to benefit from these— %$* 39
—programs, as recorded by the labor statistics, but you certainly wouldn’t know it, from the way the media covered it. %$* 39
what does this tell you about the nature of the debate when in fact the real picture of affirmative action, looks a little bit more like this. %$* 39
well, what it’s supposed to tell you, is that affirmative action is in fact about people of color of all races, and it’s supposed to tell you that it’s actually about women as well. %$* 39
so i submit, that people of good will should recoil from the bait-and- switch tactic. %$* 39
they should recoil from any kind of argument that frames this solely in terms of racial preference, and solely in terms of one group. %$* 39
i would submit to you that the proposal to eliminate affirmative action repudiates king’s call, that day standing in front of the statue of abe lincoln to make good on its promises of fairness, freedom of equality it substitutes that soaring oratory for a simple three-monkey solution to our problems. %$* 39
we can make it all go away, if we— %$* 39
—agree to see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil— %$* 39
one. %$* 33
—programs, as recorded by the labor statistics, but you certainly wouldn’t know it, from the way the media covered it. %$* 39
what does this tell you about the nature of the debate when in fact the real picture of affirmative action, looks a little bit more like this. %$* 39
well, what it’s supposed to tell you, is that affirmative action is in fact about people of color of all races, and it’s supposed to tell you that it’s actually about women as well. %$* 39
so i submit, that people of good will should recoil from the bait-and- switch tactic. %$* 39
they should recoil from any kind of argument that frames this solely in terms of racial preference, and solely in terms of one group. %$* 39
i would submit to you that the proposal to eliminate affirmative action repudiates king’s call, that day standing in front of the statue of abe lincoln to make good on its promises of fairness, freedom of equality it substitutes that soaring oratory for a simple three-monkey solution to our problems. %$* 39
we can make it all go away, if we— %$* 39
thank you— %$* 33
—agree to see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil— %$* 39
kimberlé crenshaw. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 33
uh, a couple of quick questions, uh, for me, uh, before the next part, terence pell. %$* 33
uh, the motion says “it’s time to end affirmative action,” that, that leaves open at least the possibility for people on your side that there was a time when it wasn’t time %$* 33
to end affirmative action. %$* 33
was there a period, when confronted with many american institutions, uh, that were, uh, overtly segregationist, that excluded people, was there a time when it was appropriate to have affirmative action or would you say never. %$* 33
uh—ooh. %$* 34
no, this is for terence pell. %$* 33
uh, clearly, uh, institutions that operated in completely segregated systems had to do something more than, uh, remove the, uh, fact of segregation itself, they had to take affirmative steps to break down the barriers that they themselves had created. %$* 38
that was the original idea of affirmative action and it made sense then. %$* 38
but since then it’s grown into, uh, the systematic use of preferences all over the place and that’s just a completely— %$* 38
but— %$* 33
—different %$* 38
use— %$* 38
but you’re describing cases of de facto segregation, if there was a very small population of minorities there would be a case there %$* 33
for— %$* 33
no, i’m talking about particular institutions, for example— %$* 38
one particular institutional— %$* 33
yes— %$* 38
—segregators— %$* 33
to remedy their own discrimination— %$* 38
otherwise there’s never been a case for affirmative action— %$* 33
that’s what i think, that’s right— %$* 38
okay. %$* 33
uh, and, uh, kim crenshaw, i have a question for you, uh, which is, uh, if it is, if it’s, if it makes good sense, uh, to admit a minority applicant to law school, for, for good reason, even though that candidate’s test scores and grades, uh, would not qualify for admission if, if it were a white applicant, does it equally make sense at the bar exam, where there’s a great disparity in success, to say let’s have a lower grade for passing, uh, for minority candidates. %$* 33
it’s different, we see a racial disparity, why not, what’s the difference between that, and qualifying with grades. %$* 33
well, i think there’s a case to be made that all standardized tests are deeply problematic and there’s plenty of cognitive social science to suggest that. %$* 39
so if we’re asking about whether there are alternative ways to measure merit, if there are alternative ways to measure the predictability of success, i’m all for it. %$* 39
the main point of this argument however is whether we should eliminate affirmative action in the admissions of col—in colleges and law schools and the reality is— %$* 39
but—but your colleague tim wise— %$* 33
let—let me—let, let me— %$* 39
—is not limiting himself to those subjects, yes— %$* 33
—let me point this out. %$* 39
the reality is that, what the other side will refuse to tell you, is that those tests do not tell you anything about the success of minority students and lawyers in the profession. %$* 39
president bok, president bowen, guys who were president of harvard and princeton, proved that the level of success for people who were admitted through affirmative action to higher education and law school in particular, are as successful if—if not more. %$* 39
but just define— %$* 33
notwithstanding the %$* 39
—the contours of the argument, my, my, my bar exam question. %$* 33
that’s different? %$* 33
i’m not saying it’s different, i’m saying that the proposal that you’re asking right now, is whether we should eliminate affirmative action. %$* 39
if we wanna talk about other ways to minimize the discrepancies and to minimize the other kinds of discriminatory effects on other standardized tests, i’m all for us— %$* 39
you’re open— %$* 33
—talking about that. %$* 39
okay. %$* 33
well, uh, i’m now going to announce the, uh, the results of our pre-debate audience vote first of all. %$* 33
uh, you voted before the debaters began, the panelists began debating, and the results were as follows. %$* 33
34 percent of you, uh, voted in favor of the motion, “it’s time to end affirmative action.” 44 percent voted against, and 22 percent, uh, were undecided. %$* 33
and again, at the conclusion of the debate we’ll, we’ll poll you, uh %$* 33
a second time. %$* 33
uh, to begin the discussion portion of our evening, we’re gonna try something different, i’d like to ask each of our panelists, uh, to pose a question to someone on the opposing side. %$* 33
joseph phillips first, you’re in favor of the motion, a question from you for tim wise who’s against it. %$* 33
and you’ll have about one minute to answer that question, or you’ll have exactly one minute to answer that question— %$* 33
okay. %$* 34
make the actor go first. %$* 34
gonna be protesting outside of here. %$* 34
um, i have two questions %$* 34
well, let’s have one question, it’s, uh— it’s hard enough to answer one question— %$* 33
i’m trying to choose— %$* 34
—in 60 seconds— %$* 33
—which one, we’ll, i’ll ask this one. %$* 34
i’d like to know, uh, i, i listened to tim’s speech, and, um %$* 34
i, i, i %$* 34
i thought, um %$* 34
and wanted to know why is it that, uh, that blacks, or that you seem to think that blacks can only achieve, when the playing field is level. %$* 34
well, i don’t say that black folks can only achieve when the playing field is level, i’m making a moral argument, that the playing field should be level because for it not to be, is an injustice, i’m talking about it from an ethical perspective. %$* 35
i happen to think people of—you know, madame c.j.walker was the first black millionaire, and she made it in 1911 when 67 black folks got lynched, but i don’t think we would say, well hey, if madame c.j.could make it, you know, all y’all could’ve made it. %$* 35
because she was selling beauty products to black women that white folks didn’t wanna make, good for her. %$* 35
but no one in their right mind would’ve said, see, everybody should go out there and work so i think folks can succeed, the question is what are our obligations as a society to create a level playing field, has nothing to do with what the outcome can or cannot be. %$* 35
it has to do with what is right and what is just and what is proper, and i would guess, just a guess, that when people have equal opportunity, they are indeed more likely to succeed. %$* 35
i’m pretty willing to stand on that this evening. %$* 35
and, uh %$* 33
tim wise, uh, opponent of the, of the resolution “it’s time to end affirmative action,” why don’t you pose a question to john mcwhorter who supports that rotion that motion— %$* 33
sure thing, um, john, you suggest that, people of color are potentially less qualified as evidenced by their college performance, maybe should go less selective schools as a result. %$* 35
so given that what would—what should we conclude, the people in the audience and, and those of us up here %$* 35
from the data which suggests that men, on average, also receive far lower college grades than women, of all races and ethnicities. %$* 35
does that mean that men are unqualified for the slots that they receive in colleges and law schools, and that maybe they should lower their sights to second- and third-tier schools and leave the best slots and opportunities for all the women. %$* 35
and if it doesn’t mean that, why doesn’t it mean that, given your argument about race. %$* 35
john mcwhorter, your answer. %$* 33
tim, i’m not sure that you’re aware of the degree of the discrepancies that i’m talking about. %$* 36
i mean we’ve long known about those particular gender discrepancies, and if we’re gonna talk about a kind of mindless bean-counting, then no, i’m not in favor of that kind of address of racial preferences, but when you’re dealing with schools which before a ban on preferences have a stark, two-tiered system, where black students are crashing and burning at much faster rates, then i think that in terms of arguing about— %$* 36
30 seconds. %$* 33
—morality, and how we address the past, and how we help people cope, with a nation where i don’t think that the playing field could ever possibly be perfectly level, that, there is an issue for talking about racial preferences rather than what you’re talking about. %$* 36
and, uh, john mcwhorter, why don’t you pose a question to, uh, khin mai aung who is a su—uh, an opponent of the, of the motion. %$* 33
khin, i would just ask you this. %$* 36
if, um %$* 36
when there are racial- preference policies, at least in universities, one unpleasant by- product can be a sense among a certain group that a certain level of performance is just the highest that one does because that’s just ethnically authentic, this is something that i saw when i taught at uc berkeley. %$* 36
a very smart young woman during the ban on racial preferences told me that she—she was an undergraduate working in the recruiting office—was discouraging black applicants from coming to uc berkeley if they made really high sat scores and had really good grades. %$* 36
and i asked her why and she said, in all seriousness, we’re afraid that black students who perform at that high a level, aren’t going to have a social commitment to the black community at berkeley. %$* 36
in other words— %$* 36
is there a question, to— %$* 33
—high achievers— %$* 36
—khin mai aung— %$* 33
—are not really black. %$* 36
how would you respond to that in terms of your support for racial preference policies— %$* 36
i’m sorry, could you clarify the question, there was a long— %$* 37
how do you— okay, how would you respond to the point, that, if standards are lowered for a particular group over a long period of time, after a while that may be the best that that group ever does because they’ve never been asked to do better. %$* 36
well first of all, standards are not lowered. %$* 37
diversity is a—a genuine benefit, that occurs at an institution, both for the beneficiary and for other students at that institution. %$* 37
secondly, beneficiaries of affirmative action are qualified. %$* 37
students with very low test scores are never gonna get in, unless they happen to be legacies or children of donors. %$* 37
all beneficiaries of affirmative action have test scores, and, and, and other criteria where they are, are able to succeed and they do succeed. %$* 37
in the— this 1998 study by the two— %$* 37
30 seconds. %$* 33
—presidents of the university that, um, kim crenshaw mentioned, the, the, uh, shape of the river, it found that, black students at the most prestigious institutions actually graduated at a higher rate than, than black students at less selective institutions. %$* 37
they had very similar career arcs once they graduated. %$* 37
they had the same rate of getting advanced degrees, and they were actually more likely than whites to get, um, uh, advanced degrees in law, medicine, and business, so i would say that, they are qualified and they are succeeding. %$* 37
and your question now, uh, khin mai aung, uh, who, uh, opposed the motion, put a question to terence pell who argues in favor of it. %$* 33
all right, i too am trying to decide between two questions, so, the question i’m gonna ask, actually, it’s not, um, related to your part comments today. %$* 37
but, um, i understand that, um, the organization that you work for, the center for individual rights, has a position that, um, civil rights laws should not apply to the private sector. %$* 37
and so, i’m wondering, is that—why—if you, if you’d like to explain that position, i mean, if— if we were back in the ‘60s where, when, uh, you know, we had, uh, black students trying to be served at lunch counters, um, in the south, would you, would you be standing behind the students or would you be standing behind the, um, the diners. %$* 37
well— %$* 38
terence pell. %$* 33
yes, well, the simple answer is that’s not our position and it never has been our position, we routinely rely on these civil rights laws, like section 1981, and title 6 in our lawsuits. %$* 38
those laws are primarily directed towards discrimination by private entities, uh, and private individuals, so, uh, our organization, uh, not only, uh, is not attacking those laws, we’re using those laws and we fully support the use of those laws and the various investigative agencies to go after, uh, identifiable acts of discrimination— %$* 38
30 seconds. %$* 33
—by individuals and private entities, so, the premise of your question, uh, is false. %$* 38
i—i take it i can’t respond to that? %$* 37
you can a—well, there are 20 seconds left, uh— i—i think—i think you’ll be able to get to a little bit later, perhaps— %$* 33
well, i was just gonna say— %$* 37
from the audience. %$* 33
my understanding is it was on your website in 2004. %$* 37
uh, it’s—that’s false. %$* 38
that is false, no? %$* 33
in any case, uh, uh— terence pell, it’s now your opportunity to put a question to kim crenshaw. %$* 33
kimberlé, if it turned out, if the evidence developed and, uh, that, uh, race preferences or preferential policies, uh, turn out to pose barriers, uh, to minority success, similar to the barriers you identified in your talk, uh, would you reconsider your support for them. %$* 38
i would certainly reconsider the actual form, in which affirmative action takes place, however i think that most affirmative action programs across the country, actually try to attenuate themselves to the actual conditions, so, you all are talking about affirmative action, racial preferences as though they are one program, they actually function in one kind of way. %$* 39
when in fact, there are hundreds of affirmative action programs, ranging from affirmative action in admissions, ranging from outreach programs, development programs, information programs— %$* 39
30 seconds. %$* 33
all of these forms of affirmative action have been shown to be effective for the particular obstacles that they are meant to overcome. %$* 39
the issue that i see, is that for the most part when we see various failures to perform, we tend to focus on the individuals rather than saying this is a wake-up call to our institutions. %$* 39
our institutions know how to integrate equally, do they know how to educate equally, that’s the question that is raised. %$* 39
thank you. %$* 33
uh, kimberlé crenshaw, uh, speaking and answering of that question, she is one of our panelists opposed to the motion. %$* 33
we have lots of time for your questions, for members of the audience right now. %$* 33
and i’d like to call on you, uh, please, uh, i’d ask you—i’m sorry. %$* 33
excuse me. %$* 33
i got away ahead of myself. %$* 33
i got one minute ahead of myself. %$* 33
kimberlé crenshaw, it’s your turn to put a question to joseph phillips. %$* 33
so joseph, i—i wanna clarify what i think is a confusion particularly in colin powell’s position but i also see it as a confusion that i’ve heard a lot, coming from the other side on martin luther king, about what is affirmative action and what is a preference. %$* 39
is it your understanding that colin powell does not support affirmative action, to put it more specifically, that he believes that promotions the armed forces should be absolutely color-blind? %$* 39
because that is decidedly not what he says. %$* 39
joseph phillips? %$* 33
it’s my position, that, uh %$* 34
affirmative action, in the form of racial non-discrimination, is a good thing, it’s good for america, that’s what colin powell says. %$* 34
racial preferences, uh, are not a good thing, and i don’t believe that that’s what colin powell says— %$* 34
so are you saying affirmative action is a racial preference and colin powell agrees with you on that— %$* 39
no, that’s—i said in my— %$* 34
okay. %$* 39
that’s what i wanna know— %$* 39
we’re down to a factual question, when powell spoke at the ’96 republican convention, he didn’t defend affirmative action in that %$* 33
in that speech? %$* 33
you’re asking me to go back— %$* 34
—i’m go—but— you know, you, you take one speech that someone made and they may have said other things at, at other times during other, uh, conversations. %$* 34
so i don’t know what he said during that, uh, particular speech— %$* 34
it’s in his book. %$* 39
it’s in his book. %$* 39
okay. %$* 33
uh, well— %$* 33
and i think that i, i %$* 34
uh, accurately reflected his sentiments— %$* 34
the—the only—the only point is if you’re gonna use people to support your position, you should be— %$* 39
i think i accurately— %$* 34
—you should be actually clear, that that’s their position— %$* 39
now wait a minute— %$* 34
end of panelist question time— %$* 33
—i haven’t heard from you exactly what he said— %$* 34
end of panelist question time— %$* 33
—i’ve heard you tell me that i was wrong, i didn’t hear the quote. %$* 34
read the book. %$* 31
read the book— %$* 39
i did the read— %$* 34
all right, let’s— %$* 33
do you have the quote? %$* 34
or are you just yelling out from the audience— %$* 34
the quote—the quote can be found at www.aapf.org— %$* 39
in other words you don’t have the quote— %$* 34
“13 myths about affirmative action”— %$* 39
—you’re just free to say i’m wrong— %$* 34
that’s— %$* 39
—without having— %$* 34
enough—enough on colin powell’s book. %$* 33
go read it. %$* 39
and, uh, i’m sorry, uh, to have, uh, jumped the gun a moment ago, and for the benefit of my radio producer i’ll repeat what i said. %$* 33
we have lots of time left for your questions, uh, from the audience, uh, to your panelists, i’d like you to wait until, uh, i’d like you to, to raise your hand if you’d like to ask a question, someone with a microphone will find you. %$* 33
uh, when that person does and i call on you, would you please, uh, stand up, and, uh, keep your question, if you can please keep your question brief and, uh, to the point, do, do as i say, not as i do. %$* 33
and, uh %$* 33
and then we’ll take—we’ll start by taking a question at a time, here’s a gentleman here. %$* 33
sir, you’re right there. %$* 33
thank you very much. %$* 31
uh, booker t.washington if i’m correct opposed legislative mandates to address racism, as did barry goldwater who was anything but a racist contrary to popular belief. %$* 31
i’d like to ask any of the panelists on either side, to what extent from a philosophical and constitutional perspective, either of those two gentlemen were right or wrong and why. %$* 31
uh, kimberlé crenshaw, you’re the—you’re the law professor, i’ll turn to you first. %$* 33
well, it’s not surprising that there have been african-americans throughout history who have disagreed, sometimes profoundly, um, with the positions of the majority of african-americans as to what kind of intervention should be put forward to better their condition. %$* 39
it’s important to recognize in this context that every significant program that has ever been introduced to assist african-americans to actually achieve freedom and equality has been denounced as a preference, from the emancipation proclamation, which was seen as giving them a preference, giving them something that they didn't deserve, which was basically the value of their labor; to anti-discrimination law that would protect them in their rights to, um, access to hotels and theaters, was seen as special treatment; to even the argument against segregation, which was seen as a preference. %$* 39
so, the point of the matter is, we have to always see these against the base line in society. %$* 39
if we consider the base line to be unfair, if we see the normal status quo as discriminatory, then these interventions are not seen as preferences, they're seen as equal opportunity. %$* 39
if, by contrast, we see society is basically benign, or we think it’s ok that there are these deep structural differences that won't go away by ignoring it, but we think that’s perfectly acceptable, then we’ll understand these interventions as being preferential. %$* 39
i happen to be on the former side of the case. %$* 39
i think having structured inequality over centuries is inconsistent with the deepest values of america, and therefore any kind of intervention that is intending to try to bring about real equality is not preferential, it’s in the deepest traditions of equality. %$* 39
and does anybody on the side supporting the motion want to, want to respond, either to directly address that question, or to respond to— %$* 33
booker t. washington— %$* 36
john mcwhorter. %$* 33
knew a very different world than ours, and i personally would not be in favor of his particular view that people really should just pick themselves up, and that’s all. %$* 36
really, people do need help. %$* 36
he never knew the new deal, he never knew the great society, he never knew affirmative action when it was first instituted, which i personally think was a very important thing given the situation in the country at the time. %$* 36
however, his basic insight that there does come a point when, in order to cope with an imperfect world, you have to do it yourself. %$* 36
there comes a point, is one that i think is valuable. %$* 36
one reads his writings now, and they're not nearly as reactionary and foreign as one would think. %$* 36
i think it’s an advance in our society that we do have a safety net, that we do have things to, for example, help the poor. %$* 36
for me, socio-economic preference makes perfect sense. %$* 36
the issue, simply, is that today there is not nearly as large an overlap between disadvantage and having black skin as there was in 1960 or even 1970— %$* 36
so, so when you argue it’s time— %$* 33
it’s time for a revision. %$* 36
when you argue it’s time to end affirmative action, you would say, this time is different from an earlier time— %$* 33
it was about fifteen years ago— %$* 36
became time to end affirmative action. %$* 33
oh, you have the microphone? %$* 33
yeah— %$* 9
can you, yes %$* 33
and, and if, members of the press, if you're here asking questions, could you please identify yourselves. %$* 33
hi, i have a question on set, on this test, uh, i had my, uh, undergrad studies back in china, science major, i moved on to law and business, but a lot of my classmates went on pursuing ph.d.’s, and they did, and actually i did that too, we did a gre test preparation. %$* 9
and i remember the time, you know, didn't have money, could not afford, um, materials from the test center, so all we can prepare on is based on, you know, the past ten years old exams in the public. %$* 9
or, you know, even those things are not always readily available. %$* 9
you know, i’d remember times i’d have to get oil prints of those so, but the funny thing is, these guys all went into very high level ph.d. programs, and in gre tests, uh, people out there didn't have so much preparation materials. %$* 9
you have to come to the question now— %$* 33
actually beat, actually beat us people, you know, us test, become the best performing student body, the chinese guys. %$* 9
and if a, if foreigners can do that, why people in the us cannot? %$* 9
uh, if foreigners can compete with american students on the tests that we require them to take for admission to our graduate schools, uh, why shouldn't we expect americans to do so? %$* 33
who, who wants to answer that, that question? %$* 33
tim wise? %$* 33
i don’t think it’s a question of whether we ought to expect people to do well on tests. %$* 35
i think we ought to. %$* 35
and i think we ought to make it possible for folks to do so no matter who’s taking it, whether they are taking it from some other country, whether they're taking it from down the block. %$* 35
i think the real question, however, is whether or not we ought to be looking at that test, no matter how it’s done on, by anyone, be they a foreigner, or be they someone who is a citizen of the united states, as to whether that should be the criteria for admission. %$* 35
now, the research on this is very clear, that the highest correlation you ever will get on an sat, a gre, an mcat, an lsat, or any of these tests, with actual performance in the first year after the test is taken is point four. %$* 35
that’s fairly pathetic in statistical terms, because what it means is that, at most, sixteen percent of the difference between any two students can be explained or predicted by that score, meaning eighty-four percent has nothing to do with it. %$* 35
why are we using merit criteria that don’t really measure merit, but do typically, not always, but over-represent those that have those resources, and those who are affluent. %$* 35
not only, there are folks who don't have the resources who sometimes do well, but that’s the highest correlation. %$* 35
it seems to me that we ought to be looking at alternative criteria, including things like testing, but not overemphasizing those, because we know that in fact when those students who scored lower, who maybe didn't score as well as those at the very pinnacle get in at places like the university of california, that only about five percent of their grade differences can be predicted by the test scores. %$* 35
so, they're not being mismatched, they're not unqualified, there are other things that recommend them for the spot. %$* 35
so, we ought to expect and try to make sure everyone does well. %$* 35
we also ought to have a criteria that is both more fair and representative, but also more accurate. %$* 35
it doesn’t serve anyone’s interests to use a criteria that does not, in fact, predict success, and those tests simply do not. %$* 35
in fact, one study of law schools, talking about law schools, university of michigan study found that there was an inverse relationship between lsat score and future professional success. %$* 35
meaning that those who did better actually did worse and weren't as happy in their jobs when they got out of law school and started practicing. %$* 35
so by that criteria, we ought o let all the folks in who bombed the lsat, because they're going to make the best lawyers. %$* 35
next question from the audience. %$* 33
can i just add something to that as well? %$* 37
i mean, part of it is also you said that these foreigners were able to prep, which i would imagine means that they speak english and perhaps are from a professional background, that they, they knew about these tests. %$* 37
and i think that that is, that is a big issue, that, that the access to the materials and access to information about the tests also isn't equally available. %$* 37
next question. %$* 33
uh, good, good evening. %$* 9
each of the panelists against the motion insists that the beneficiaries of affirmative action have been as successful as any other students in school. %$* 9
if that’s the case, should the children of those beneficiaries, and the grandchildren of those beneficiaries, since it’s been forty years, should they continue to get the preferences, uh, afforded by affirmative action, and if, if it’s not time to end it now, when is the time to end it? %$* 9
kim crenshaw? %$* 33
you know, one of the fallacies in this argument is the assumption that socio-economic disadvantage has completely wiped out the ongoing reality of race disadvantage. %$* 39
or, to put it another way, people think that when we’re talking about the black middle class, we’re talking about the same thing as the white middle class. %$* 39
people think that sons and daughters of people with a college diploma are going to have the same kind of life circumstances as sons and daughters of white people with, with diplomas. %$* 39
nothing could be further from the truth. %$* 39
if anything, the most significant difference between african-americans who are middle class and whites who are middle class, is the ten times wealth difference between one and the other. %$* 39
let me put it another way. %$* 39
whites who have basically the same income, still have between eight to ten times more wealth. %$* 39
now, why is that important? %$* 39
wealth is associated with everything that makes you competitive. %$* 39
it puts you in communities where you have the better schools. %$* 39
it puts you in health care situations where you have better care. %$* 39
it puts you in social networks where you hear more about what material you need to know, what opportunities are available for you. %$* 39
so the reality is that there is a lifetime of difference— %$* 39
but, but return to the question— %$* 33
between being, between being— %$* 39
let’s narrow the question, doctors and lawyers, doctors and lawyers who have benefited from these programs, why should their children be beneficiaries of the same program— %$* 33
and my, and my answer is, why shouldn't they be? %$* 39
what do we have to know about the lives of african-american middle class to come to the conclusion that perhaps one generation ago they were socio-economically disadvantaged, but this generation they're not? %$* 39
in every major statistical finding about the actual life circumstances of african-americans, there are still a range of disadvantages that they face. %$* 39
now, is it going to be the same level of affirmative action as someone who is, um, truly, uh, impoverished? %$* 39
of course not. %$* 39
but most affirmative action programs don’t function that way. %$* 39
they give you benefits for both being socially, economically disadvantaged, and race as well. %$* 39
the point is, race still marks life of african-americans. %$* 39
any comments on this from the— %$* 33
disadvantage— %$* 34
joseph phillips. %$* 33
range of disadvantage, disadvantages, uh, do not come with a black face. %$* 34
uh, and this is why earlier i said, we need to talk about people, because when we start talking in these broad terms, we’re talking about the black middle class, i happen to live in los angeles, down the street from calabasas california, which is one of the wealthiest communities in america. %$* 34
i coach football, and i have black kids on my team with parents who make more money than most, half of everybody in here added up together. %$* 34
the idea that, that these children are in need of preferences because they don’t have access, uh ,to, to the same, uh, benefits that their white counterparts, is just ridiculous. %$* 34
because we’re not talking about individuals suddenly, we’re talking about people, um, generally, in term of their race. %$* 34
i also want to go back to, to address something else that was said, this idea of, of this testing. %$* 34
look, right now, these are the tests that we’re using, and i want you to listen very closely, what we’re talking about, oh, the tests, uh, not the preparation, and on and on and this %$* 34
the underlying message is that our kids can't compete, that my three sons cannot compete. %$* 34
and i don’t buy it. %$* 34
well, that’s— %$* 36
if we want to get rid of these tests, then let’s get rid of them. %$* 34
whatever standard we use, the standard should be applied equally to all kids— %$* 34
robert? %$* 36
that's what we’re saying here. %$* 34
could i %$* 36
briefly from john mcwhorter, and then a reply, perhaps, from the, uh %$* 33
the opponents. %$* 33
john mcwhorter? %$* 33
i think that one thing that we are leaving out of the discussion, and you have to bring it in, is that much of the reason that, uh, middle class black kids have trouble with submitting the same kind of file as a white kid would have, is a tendency among black teens to say that it is white to do well in school. %$* 36
there’s a myth nowadays, there is a myth nowadays that that has been disproven. %$* 36
and i’d like to try to be as pacific as possible here, pacific is the word i'm using, but here i can't, that’s a myth. %$* 36
there are many studies, i’ve looked at all of them in detail, all of them show, even when they don’t think they're showing it, that there is a strong tendency for black kids to tease each other that way. %$* 36
there are reasons for it. %$* 36
but, the question is, how does, how do racial preference programs address that particular problem, which i think is addressable, and is being addressed by things that go on before kids go to college? %$* 36
we can't just leave that out of the discussion because the data is inconvenient, and i think it’s absolutely crucial to the things that we’re talking about. %$* 36
robert? %$* 35
that’s john mcwhorter, and we’ve heard several points made by the supporters of the motion, so to the opponents, and tim wise, yes? %$* 33
i just, responding to the last thing john said, i think it’s interesting that he’s upset about, supposedly, ostensibly, middle class black kids saying that it’s white to be smart, and somehow that’s their pathology, and that’s the problem we should address. %$* 35
it’s an issue, we could discuss it at a different time. %$* 35
what i find interesting about it is that you, john, are affiliated with the manhattan institute, which has received money from the bradley foundation, hundreds of thousands of dollars. %$* 35
this is a foundation that paid charles murray to write the bell curve, which is a book that doesn’t imply that black people are inferior, it screams it from forty percent of its pages. %$* 35
so, when you say that black folks say being smart or doing well in school is acting white, the book, the bell curve, funded by the same people that fund the organization you work for, basically says the same thing, it says high iq is white, or perhaps asian, and black folks are genetically defective. %$* 35
i find it disingenuous for you to put the burden of that on black children, and not the very wealthy, well- heeled, well-funded white folks who actually print material that says black people are defective. %$* 35
and not one prominent conservative in this country, including the three of you, said anything public when the bell curve came out, not one word, not one prominent conservative. %$* 35
let’s place our attention on those who actually say that white people are smarter, and black people are inferior, and you won't hear that from any of this. %$* 35
john mcwhorter? %$* 33
john mcwhorter, quick reply, then we’ll get another question. %$* 33
yes? %$* 33
sir, when the bell curve came out, i was very young, i had no public presence, i was studying linguistics, and so i don’t know what i would have said. %$* 36
to the extent that bradley funded that book, which i frankly did not know, and that they fund some work that the manhattan institute does, that’s certainly true. %$* 36
charles murray has nothing to do with the manhattan institute, and stopped, as a matter of fact, while he was writing that book. %$* 36
and what i'm funded for doing at the manhattan institute is things like working on prisoner re-entry programs, et cetera. %$* 36
but what’s important is that when i talk about the “acting white” phenomenon, i'm not saying that it’s a pathology, i'm not blaming the black kids for this, this is something that happened as the result of a sequence of socio-historical things that ultimately have their root in racism. %$* 36
nevertheless, it is there today, and i don’t think that it can be denied. %$* 36
and the issue is to treat it, and to show black kids that there are different ways to think along those lines. %$* 36
ok, well enough about those other institutions, and uh %$* 33
back to questions from the audience. %$* 33
sir? %$* 33
yes, thank you. %$* 9
um, let’s say that it’s irrelevant what harvard and yale do as private institutions, and i don’t care if they're one, two-headed people, it doesn’t mean anything. %$* 9
we’re in new york city, the home of city university, a great publicly supported institution, supported by all the tax payers of new york city, the sons of cops and transit workers, teachers, retail people, garment salesmen, everybody. %$* 9

we don’t want “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” anything to do with you. %$* 27
you have no basis, i bet, you’ve never made a phone call, you’ve never asked a question, and you’ve done no reporting to find out whether abe foxman made that call, which has never been proven. %$* 27
i sit on the board of penn and we raised the tony judd question. %$* 27
absolutely nobody could ascertain whether or not abe foxman made that call. %$* 27
he may have made it, or he may not. %$* 27
somebody made the call. %$* 27
but you’re— %$* 27
but he does have tourette’s syndrome— %$* 29
—very, very, very confident— you’re very, very confident in accusing of somebody in public of something that you know nothing about— %$* 27
let’s have another question— %$* 24
—which is gross ignorance, but no, i would like to finish something for a minute, jeffrey. %$* 27
i’m not done. %$* 27
a gentleman with a british accent asked a question earlier of david cesarani which he ducked very carefully. %$* 27
he raised the question, why is it that you’re so nervous about the broad public in his criticism of enlightenment thinking and of mill and of this one and that one. %$* 27
he sort of yearns for a clubby time, when you could count on a “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” few select elites having a kind of common agreement. %$* 27
and that now what’s dangerous to him is the proliferation of voices, the idea that there are many ideas out there on the internet, oh my goodness, and we can’t regulate them, and they might get in the hands of the wrong people and we can’t even agree who they are. %$* 27
for goodness sakes, those clubby people, as they put it, you know, even the jews can have an opinion. %$* 27
i mean, why are you so concerned that there might actually be some unregulated voices out there? %$* 27
you know what, let’s just go to a question. %$* 24
i think that it’s sometimes a lot harder to defend very hateful, personal speech, like when hate groups leaflet the lawn of a neighborhood where a black family has just moved into a white neighborhood. %$* 31
we’re running low on time, so get to a question, please. %$* 24
but daisy, do you really think that it’s a problem that we had cartoons that were %$* 31
unfortunately distasteful to muslim people, but cartoons in a newspaper that were quite humorous really, and i think they were talking about quite a legitimate political issue. %$* 31
do you really want to ban that kind of free speech? %$* 31
you “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 31
don’t want to allow editorial cartoons? %$* 24
that’s a fair question, but we’ve sort of done this question, we’ve done the danish cartoons— we’ve done this question, yes, yes, it’s a waste of a question— %$* 24
i think that’s a good point. %$* 24
up there at the top. %$* 24
i would just like to know, and i’ll be the first to admit that i was not aware of this whole discussion about the cancellation of this meeting. %$* 31
but when mr. %$* 31
foxman, or if anyone who called and got it canceled did so, were death threats part of the reason— of course not— %$* 31
no, they were not, you know, let’s— %$* 24
okay, thank you— %$* 31
i mean, let’s put abe foxman and gallileo aside and— %$* 24
i do have a jot point that i would like to make. %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” oh— %$* 29
i’ll make it quickly. %$* 29
okay, quickly, christopher. %$* 24
after my punch-up with george galloway recently i was asked by the republican jewish committee in washington to come and speak to their ‘do down at the old temple and talk about the oil- for-food program and other things like that. %$* 29
they put my name on the bill, and then a gentleman named mort klein who some of you will know %$* 29
he’s a madman who runs the zionist organization of america. %$* 29
he kicked up a terrific fuss because of some remarks i’d once made about theodore herzl, among other things, and got the meeting canceled. %$* 29
now, i don’t particularly complain about that as a matter of fact, and i don’t share in the tremendous steambath of self-pity that mr. %$* 29
judd has managed to generate. %$* 29
you have a right to your opinion. %$* 29
you don’t have necessarily have a right to the audience of the republican jewish committee. %$* 29
they can decide not to have you. %$* 29
that’s okay. %$* 29
i’m just trying to say, just for once if we could stop people intruding things that “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” don’t belong in this discussion, it’d save such a lot of time. %$* 29
two more questions, this gentleman right here. %$* 24
where do you draw the line between free speech and political correctness. %$* 31
another— %$* 29
you know, that’s sort of— %$* 24
waste of a question— %$* 27
we’ve been dealing with that issue generally, why don’t we get to this gentleman over here. %$* 24
back here? %$* 32
no, this gentleman in the white shirt, get a microphone. %$* 24
stupid, boring questions should be disallowed. %$* 29
no, but we need the microphone for radio purposes though. %$* 24
you can’t speak loud enough so that all of wnyc can hear you. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
thank you, just a quick question. %$* 31
one of the things i noticed on the panel is that no one talked about the civil rights movement and how that’s affected the topic here. %$* 31
also, just quite frankly, how come there’s no african-american people on the panel? %$* 31
i’d just like to get your thoughts on that. %$* 31
next. %$* 29
well, i mean i think that’s a point that everyone can take for what it’s worth. %$* 24
at the end? %$* 24
that was useful for the radio audience— %$* 27
at the top, at the very top, underneath the light. %$* 24
that’s you, go ahead. %$* 24
okay, this is a question for mari. %$* 31
you talked about women in the workforce. %$* 31
i don’t work on an oil rig, but i do work on a trading floor. %$* 31
i’m just wondering if you think that by limiting what people can say to me, if that’s actually protecting me from what people are thinking about me, and whether when i come into the office, i need to take care of myself. %$* 31
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 31
good. %$* 29
mari? %$* 24
i trust that you can. %$* 26
but there are circumstances in which women have left jobs because they could not handle the relentless and brutal assaults on their personhood. %$* 26
this is why in civil rights law, to— %$* 26
not free expression. %$* 29
—respond to the earlier question— %$* 26
not a free expression— wait, wait. %$* 29
the reason in civil rights and anti-discrimination law we do limit speech in the workplace, is that ideas about your inferiority, about your inherent lack of worth as a human being and your lack of entitlement to equality in the workplace, if they’re expressed regularly to you, create an environment in which it’s impossible for you to do your job on an equal basis with everyone else. %$* 26
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 26
does someone on this side want to address the point mari’s made, which is that there is kind of speech, harassment. %$* 24
is that speech you seek to protect? %$* 24
i get that kind of speech all the time. %$* 25
one of my favorites was being called a liberal cocksucker. %$* 25
now, i don’t know whether that means i like to cock-suck liberally or i only suck liberal cock or i just am not quite sure. %$* 25
but i didn’t call the police on it. %$* 25
furthermore, half the people who write me horrible, horrible things, no one has seen my mail, they all start it, “dear mr. %$* 25
wilkinson.” so it’s not me as a woman, it’s the ideas i put in the paper, and if we can’t discuss those ideas, even when they talk to me in loathsome, funny ways, we can’t talk. %$* 25
the one thing i would like to say about the whole danish cartoonist thing is this. %$* 25
having had that confrontation has changed minds on both sides. %$* 25
the bbc reported that about two weeks ago there was another minor dust-up about it. %$* 25
but the reason you didn’t hear about it is because the muslim side realized that it really wasn’t great pr to kill people in pakistan to protest cartoons in denmark. %$* 25
so it’s a much different protest, it’s “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” been handled differently on both sides, including the danish side. %$* 25
this is how we learn. %$* 25
we learn by conflict, we learn by calling each other things that, ehh, well, maybe weren’t a great idea at the time, but we can do it differently next time. %$* 25
forgive me for interrupting, but it’s now time to vote. %$* 24
if you want to vote for the motion— everybody’s got their cards—you want to tear off the greenish-blue, kind of aqua side. %$* 24
if you want to vote against, you tear off the red side. %$* 24
if you don’t know where you stand, you just put the entire ticket in the box. %$* 24
now, can i ask everyone to please vote quietly. %$* 24
the boxes will be passed around. %$* 24
how long does this take. %$* 29
no, it’s going to go on while you—you’re going to talk while they’re doing it. %$* 24
you can start right away. %$* 24
all right. %$* 29
wait. %$* 27
who stars? %$* 27
while you’re voting we’re going to go to final statements. %$* 24
the order is, please begin against the proposition, mari matsuda. %$* 24
you can stay where you are. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
we docked some of her time, remember. %$* 27
we docked some of her time. %$* 27
yes, we did dock some of her time. %$* 24
the “n” word is hollered out from a passing car to let a black man know that he is not walking in a neighborhood where he is welcome or safe. %$* 26
the speaker knows the effect of that word, and uses it precisely because it terrorizes. %$* 26
i asked earlier: why is it that we recognize in american law that if someone spits on your shoe, that’s an attack on your person, but we won’t recognize words that we know, socially, historically, from the reality of the human lives that we live, have exactly the same effect on your personhood and your ability to move freely? %$* 26
i am talking about liberty and it’s fascinating that we are all coming from the enlightenment tradition. %$* 26
as much as we disagree, i feel affinity with people on the opposing side because we are all concerned with losing our democracy and losing our freedom. %$* 26
i think there are forms of speech that make us less free because we stop talking to each other and we don’t have the conversations we need to survive. %$* 26
allowing this kind of invective perpetuated %$* 26
daisy has been out on a limb by herself defending the muslim “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” community and i have to speak up. %$* 26
there is hatred of islam in this country and it’s not a healthy thing. %$* 26
there’s also ignorance. %$* 26
we need to open a space where we can talk to each other, disagree, criticize, and learn, and that space closes when people are allowed to assault. %$* 26
i’m not asking for censorship, i’m asking that if you support the proposition, you’re making a choice for a license to assault. %$* 26
daisy, that— %$* 26
if you oppose it— that’s it— %$* 26
—you open the door for a conversation about limits. %$* 26
okay, next. %$* 24
thank you. %$* 24
that was mari matsuda. %$* 24
now for the proposition, signe wilkinson. %$* 24
well, i basically said earlier pretty much what i think here. %$* 25
i’ll just go back to what christopher said. %$* 25
this is a conversation. %$* 25
if you forbid someone to say what’s truly on their mind, you won’t know what is on their mind. %$* 25
it’s better almost every time, it seems to me, to find out what it is, and then be able to deal with “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” it. %$* 25
i think that some of the questions get back to what is truly hateful speech and our history is filled with, for example, horrible images of black americans who were made fun of simply because they were black, and these images occurred everywhere, in courier and ives and all of the major publications in the united states. %$* 25
but the way that changed was not by someone saying, you may not ever, ever do a bad caricature of a black person. %$* 25
it was changed because the civil rights movement and black americans showed through their own incredible endurance and persistence in going for equal rights in this country, that that movement made those images look awful. %$* 25
you can’t look at them today without wincing. %$* 25
it says more about the people who drew the cartoons than about who they were drawn by i feel sorry for you in new york because you don’t have very many really bitter cartoons published here, the new york times protects you from that. %$* 25
but i really urge you to go on the web, find out what people are thinking, and you’ll find out through cartoons among other pieces of free speech. %$* 25
thank you. %$* 24
thank you, signe wilkinson. %$* 24
against, david cesarani. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
i think what signe said then about the struggle of black americans to eradicate racist images from public media was very interesting and very important. %$* 28
it was about equal rights. %$* 28
there was a loss. %$* 28
there were some cartoonists who made a living from, you know, making fun of black people and depicting them in ghastly ways who probably went out of business, or just migrated to certain parts of america where that sort of thing is still tolerated. %$* 28
elsewhere, however, the dignity and equality of black americans—as is true of women, gays, and other groups who used to suffer demeaning and degrading images and speech acts—and the need to create and preserve a civilized, civil society, in which civility and respect of one for another is absolutely vital, triumphed. %$* 28
dignity, equality and civility are values. %$* 28
they are goods. %$* 28
our freedom of expression is a value, and it is a good. %$* 28
on this side we’ve simply been asking you to weigh up those values, those goods. %$* 28
we think that human dignity, equal treatment, and having a truly civil society is worth a modest, preferable voluntary degree of constraint, restraint, a kind of humility. %$* 28
knowing where to draw the line. %$* 28
thank you. %$* 28
thank you. %$* 24
david cesarani. %$* 24
now, for the proposition, philip gourevitch. %$* 24
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 24
the proposition is, freedom of expression must include the license to offend. %$* 27
i would return to the idea that this is fundamentally the lesser of various not-ideal prospects. %$* 27
the other prospect is that one licenses someone to determine what offends, and that one is always at the prey of that question. %$* 27
who is to judge, who is to decide, how are we to restrict their ability to license our ability to offend. %$* 27
in other words how are we to restrict their ability to restrict us. %$* 27
at what point does this admittedly slippery slope immediately become this greased precipice, and we fall off into a very dangerous situation. %$* 27
the other side says, speech is dangerous, speech can be hateful, there’s hatred and ignorance out there, and therefore they want, in some way, to muzzle the people they fear are dangerous. %$* 27
i agree with them that speech can be dangerous and that there is a great deal of hatred and ignorance out there. %$* 27
we’ve heard a good deal of ignorance even tonight. %$* 27
i feel that that is why i urge you strongly to listen to the dangerous speech you’re hearing from the other side, and recognize exactly how it can impinge upon your ability not only to speak but to think. %$* 27
the fact that they keep using this strangely castrated phrase, “the ‘n’ word.” which is supposed to be inoffensive, but is actually doubly offensive because it restricts you from the ability to hear the full offense of “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” the word “nigger.” they’re at every time trying to double back and triple around and make you use words and trip over your own mind and not think and not speak what actually might occur to you in your effort to observe reality and contend with it. %$* 27
i think that’s a very dangerous predicament, i think that they’re presumptuous and wild in their notion that we can do that reasonably, and i think that we are at less risk taking the great risk of freedom. %$* 27
thank you, philip gourevitch. %$* 24
against the proposition, daisy khan. %$* 24
if all of us here wanted to offend each other, i’m sure we can. %$* 30
but would it be beneficial to building trust, and building long-term relationships? %$* 30
i was stunned at the response i got about my rabbi friend. %$* 30
it is because i had been dialoguing with the jewish community— %$* 30
what jewish friend. %$* 29
stop. %$* 24
enough. %$* 24
what rabbi friend. %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
yes, your question has been registered. %$* 30
daisy, please continue. %$* 30
it is the deep dialogue that has been going on between me and the jewish community that has resulted in that concern for our community. %$* 30
it is out of that concern that the rabbi friend reached out to me and said, do not let this happen to you. %$* 30
so i was a little shell-shocked at the reaction we got from people here. %$* 30
as i mentioned, we’re living in a tense global environment, where misunderstanding is increased by peddlers of fear, and overpowered by intolerance. %$* 30
today what is needed is civility, tolerance, patience, and sincerity. %$* 30
we need to get rid of negative words like “offend”—it’s a neighbor word—and replace them with positive words like “befriend.” only once you make the effort to understand the perspective of the other person can you begin to understand the rationale behind their actions and thoughts. %$* 30
furthermore, you’ll be in a better position to influence them, and only then can you even begin to be critical. %$* 30
we humans have a nasty habit of judging the book by its cover. %$* 30
if you’re offensive, it is difficult to make a difference because you’re seen as hostile, and your views are unwelcomed and outright rejected. %$* 30
this is human nature. %$* 30
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” no doubt it is essential to be critical. %$* 30
but do so at the right time, in the right environment, and with the right choice of words. %$* 30
sticks and stones are not the only things that break bones, ladies and gentlemen, words do too. %$* 30
on a personal note, the reason i’m here today and i’ve dedicated the rest of my life to furthering understanding between peoples has to do with my powerful memories of my childhood in kashmir. %$* 30
i went to catholic school, was taught by irish nuns, learned math from hindu professors, played with sikhs and buddhists and was told the tale of how kashmiris were from the lost 10th tribe of israel. %$* 30
i was exposed to this broad perspective of unity and diversity, where celebrating and honoring each other’s traditions and beliefs was a way of life, but alas, this heaven turned into hell too. %$* 30
if all of us here wanted to offend each other, i’m sure we can. %$* 30
but would it be beneficial to building trust, and building long-term relationships? %$* 30
i was stunned at the response i got about my rabbi friend. %$* 30
it is because i had been dialoguing with the jewish community— %$* 30
thank you, daisy khan, against the proposition. %$* 24
finally, for the proposition, christopher hitchens. %$* 24
the real question, or if you like, subtext question before us is this—is nothing sacred. %$* 29
what we’ve really been discussing is the old question of whether or not there is such an offense as blasphemy or profanity. %$* 29
now if i don’t tell you exactly what i think about the simpering speeches that we heard from the other side, i’m not censoring myself, i’m just being polite and civil and saving some of your time. %$* 29
what i will not prevent myself from “freedom of expression must include the license to offend” saying, and will not let anyone else prevent me from saying, is the following. %$* 29
it is wrong and always has been for churches, powerful, secular, human institutions, to claim exemption from criticism, which is what’s really being asked here. %$* 29
if there’s going to be respect, it has to be mutual. %$* 29
does islam respect my right to un-belief? %$* 29
of course it does not. %$* 29
does it respect the right of a muslim to apostasize and change belief? %$* 29
of course it does not. %$* 29
i can name now four or five friends—six or eight, maybe, if i had time—five or six you would certainly have heard of—who have to live their lives under police protection for commenting on islam. %$* 29
for having an opinion on it. %$* 29
this is getting steadily worse all the time, and it’s grotesque. %$* 29
here is an enormous religion with gigantic power that claims that an archangel spoke to an illiterate peasant, and brought him a final revelation that supercedes all others. %$* 29
it’s a plagiarism by an epileptic of the worst bits of judaism and christianity. %$* 29
that’s obvious, it seems to me. %$* 29
how long do you think i’m going to be able to say that anywhere i like? %$* 29
it would already be quite a risky thing to say in quite a lot of places. %$* 29
i did not come to the united states of america 25 years to learn how to keep my mouth shut. %$* 29
i’m going to reject all offers that i change that policy, however simperingly they are put, okay? %$* 29
“freedom of expression must include the license to offend” %$* 29
please join me in thanking the debaters for a terrific work. %$* 24
now it’s time for me to announce the results. %$* 24
as you recall, just to refresh your memory, before the debate was 177 for the proposition, 25 against, and 24 don’t know. %$* 24
now, the result is 201 for the proposition, 39 against, 1 doesn’t know. %$* 24
so please congratulate the “for” team for winning the debate. %$* 24
i’d like to invite everyone to return next month for the third intelligence squared debate, wednesday, november 29th here at the asia society. %$* 24
the motion to be debated there has nothing to do with abe foxman or gallileo. %$* 24
the subject is “a democratically elected hamas is still a terrorist organization,” and it will be moderated by judy woodruff. %$* 24
an edited version of tonight’s intelligence squared debate can be heard locally on wnyc-am 820, on friday, october 27th, at 2 p.m. %$* 24
check your other npr listings for other broadcasts outside of new york city. %$* 24
please be sure to pick up a copy of media sponsor thursday edition the times of london and a times literary supplement on your way out. %$* 24
thank you all for coming. %$* 24

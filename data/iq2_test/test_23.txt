at the moment, our debaters are coming down toward the stage so i just wanna ask you for a round of applause for all of them. %$* 13
and may i introduce the founder and ceo of intelligence squared us, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, we’re nothing if not timely, uh, there was an eight-column headline in today’s new york times. %$* 1
quote, “two gunmen kill man, 19, and wound four people in a brooklyn hair salon.” we all remember the headlines around the virginia massacre. %$* 1
it’s not headline news, but some 17,000 suicides are committed with guns every year in america. %$* 1
so gun control has a very powerful emotional appeal. %$* 1
and in new york you can sort of have the idea that only gun nuts are opposed to control. %$* 1
so what is the debate about tonight? %$* 1
where is the case for guns reducing crime? %$* 1
it really lies in two ideas, it’s the idea that guns can prevent crimes, if people have guns at home or in their cars they can prevent crimes by firing a warning shot, by simply announcing i’ve got a gun, and those are very undramatic incidents, they’re not reported in the newspapers. %$* 1
but, they’re real and they happen every day. %$* 1
crimes can be deterred by the prevalence of guns. %$* 1
in the united states it’s very unusual for robbers to come into homes that are occupied. %$* 1
in britain it’s much more common. %$* 1
and the reason is that guns in the home can act as a real deterrent. %$* 1
in another context of course there’s a constitutional right to bear arms. %$* 1
and that’s not just a sort of historic anomaly. %$* 1
it really reflects a basic, natural law, idea of self- defense. %$* 1
and people who have taken the trouble to train themselves and to use guns properly in their self-defense, this is a very, very important right for them and something that they hold onto with a great deal of emotional force as well. %$* 1
but, tonight we’re trying to transcend emotion, we’re really trying to see whether gun control keeps guns away from criminals, or whether it allows the criminals to have a monopoly of gun power. %$* 1
whether the preventive effects and the deterrent effects of guns in the hands of a law-abiding populace actually make us safer. %$* 1
or, are the costs involved in these gun accidents and rampages and suicides that we all see in the headlines, is that the dominant factor in our thinking about gun policy. %$* 1
so with that kind of framing of the debate i’m really happy to hand the evening over to john donvan, our moderator from abc news, and the terrific panel that we’ve assembled tonight. %$* 1
thank you for being here. %$* 1
thank you, and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz who makes all of this possible for us. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating brought to america’s shores. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of “abc news nightline.” on this stage tonight as your host and more importantly your moderator for another in our series of smart and sparkling debates on topics that matter. %$* 13
the motion before us in this program here at the caspary auditorium of the rockefeller university in new york—the motion before us, “guns reduce crime.” which may sound counterintuitive, but that actually depends on how this debate goes, and it may actually sound intuitive, again depending on how the debate goes. %$* 13
we are joined also on this stage by two teams of debaters, of three members each, each of them superbly qualified to be taking part in this discussion. %$* 13
you are also a part of the evening, in that this is a contest, it is a contest of persuasion. %$* 13
these debaters are here to influence your views, to try to change your minds if you disagree with their position. %$* 13
it is a contest of logic and wit and charm and humor but mostly it is a contest of the power of ideas. %$* 13
in order to gauge and include your participation, we are going to poll you twice during the evening, once in a moment, and once at the end of the debate, in order to see where you stand on this motion that guns reduce crime. %$* 13
so at this point, we would like each of you to turn to the number pads at your seats, and indicate your agreement, disagreement, or lack of decision, over this proposition, the proposition before us that guns reduce crime. %$* 13
while you’re doing that i wanna point out the shape of the evening. %$* 13
each of the debaters will have opening statements. %$* 13
those statements will last seven minutes and it will be timed by us in this way— at the one-minute mark, when they have spoken six minutes and have seven minutes—one minute to go, they will hear a tone, a warning tone that sounds like this. %$* 13
that means they can talk and talk and talk. %$* 13
it— did you all hear that? %$* 13
clearly? %$* 13
at the seven-minute mark when time is up, the same tone will sound except it will be more persistent, more like this. %$* 13
and it will continue to do that until the speaker— stops—talking. %$* 13
after the opening round, our second round will be a head-to-head debate in which the debaters will debate among themselves, and also will take questions from me and questions from you, the audience. %$* 13
i encourage you to be critical in the way you listen, and critical in the way you ask questions, because once again, you are the judges of this evening, you will decide the winners of this debate. %$* 13
and then at the end of the debate once again we will poll you to see where we stand on the numbers. %$* 13
there will be a two-minute summary statement by each debater to wrap up the event and at that point we will announce the winners based on your judgment. %$* 13
so with that said, let the debate begin. %$* 13
only rarely does a man of ideas witness in his own lifetime, the opportunity to actually see one of his ideas change history. %$* 13
for a scholar who wrote a controversial book in the 1990s, arguing that, where there is more gun ownership there is actually less crime, that history-making experience took place. %$* 13
legislatures across the country took hold of the ideas in that book, and passed laws allowing for the carrying of concealed weapons, that indeed was history-making. %$* 13
the author of that idea and of the book that contained those ideas, is our first debater tonight, speaking for the motion, “guns reduce crime,” john lott. %$* 13
well, thank you very much, i appreciate mr. %$* 61
rosenkranz putting this on and it’s an honor to be invited here and the introduction was overly generous. %$* 61
but guns cause bad things to happen and makes—and guns make it easier for bad things to happen. %$* 61
but guns also make it easier for people to protect themselves and prevent bad things from happening. %$* 61
guns make it easier for you to harm somebody, but guns also make it easier for you to deter criminals from attacking to begin with, and turn out to be the most effective way for somebody to go and defend themselves when they’re having to face a criminal by themselves. %$* 61
it’d be great if police were there all the time, my research finds that police are probably the single most important factor for reducing crime. %$* 61
but i think one thing the police understand themselves is they virtually always arrive on the crime scenes after the crime’s occurred. %$* 61
and the question you have to ask is what do you advise someone having to do, when they’re having to confront a criminal by themselves? %$* 61
even if they’re able to call 911, you know, fast response times are measured in eight or nine or 10 minutes. %$* 61
and that can be a lifetime for many people. %$* 61
i think, as mr. %$* 61
rosenkranz was mentioning to begin with, a lot of people have a pretty good idea of the bad things that happen with guns. %$* 61
he mentioned the number of suicides. %$* 61
but you also have, if you look at surveys done by the justice department you’ll find maybe about 400-450,000 crimes are committed each year with guns. %$* 61
by contrast, you have similar types of surveys that indicate that people use guns defensively about 2 million times a year. %$* 61
so about four to five times more frequently people use guns to stop crimes than guns are used in the commission of crime. %$* 61
and yet, i assume for exactly the reasons why mr. %$* 61
rosenkranz mentioned earlier, people are if anything like to guess the opposite. %$* 61
i mean if you have—if you’re the editor of a newspaper and you have two crimes that you’re talking about, one, there’s a dead body on the ground, sympathetic person like a victim, and another case where a woman’s brandished a gun, the would-be criminals run away, no shots are fired, no dead body on the ground, it’s pretty obvious which story’s gonna be considered much more newsworthy. %$* 61
now, we all want to try to take guns away from criminals. %$* 61
i mean one thing that’s been tried many times is to go and have gun bans. %$* 61
the problem is that when you go and pass something like that, the question you have to ask yourself many times is who’s most likely to obey the rule. %$* 61
if it turns out that it’s the most law-abiding citizens who obey the rule and turn in their guns, relative to the criminals, you can actually see increases in violent crime. %$* 61
and washington d.c.is one important example of that. %$* 61
in 1976, september of ’76, d.c.passed a ban banning handguns, it didn’t go into effect until february, uh, ’77.uh, but only once after ’76 was d.c.’s murder rate as low as it was in ’76.only twice in two years after that was d.c.’s robbery rate as low as it was in ’76.and d.c.’s crime rate not only went up relative to what it was in the past, d.c.’s crime rate went up relative to neighboring states, it went up compared to the united states as a whole, it went up relative to other large cities. %$* 61
here’s a graph that shows you for the top 50 cities of the united states, in 1976, d.c.was about 18 percentage points higher than the other 49 cities in the top 50.you can see after that, it keeps on going up, and if i were to have it in ’88, it even soars dramatically past that, but you can see, it’s about 90 percent higher when you get to 1987, the rate was falling before the ban, relative to other cities and rising dramatically afterward. %$* 61
it’s not just d.c.though. %$* 61
in chicago, chicago’s murder and robbery rates were falling prior to the 1982 ban, and they rose afterwards, they rose relative to other cities. %$* 61
one other way i can just mention for d.c. here, d.c. was 15th of the top %$* 61
50 cities prior to the ban. %$* 61
in half the years after the ban, it was either number one or number two, and it was number four another four years, so two-thirds of the time after the ban, it was one of the top four cities. %$* 61
it was nowhere even close to that prior to the ban going into effect. %$* 61
it’s just not in the united states. %$* 61
worldwide, time after time—and it’d be interesting to have people try to show an example where this isn’t true—when you pass bans you see increases in violent crime rates. %$* 61
the uk, here’s an illustration from the economist a few years ago. %$* 61
they’d banned handguns in january ’97.robbery rates, armed robbery rates were falling up until the time the ban went into effect, and they rose afterwards, if you’d continue this graph they’d continue to go up. %$* 61
you’ve had a 340 percent increase since the ban went into effect and the rate at which people are harmed by guns. %$* 61
you look at ireland, jamaica— i mean one thing is, people go and say well the reason why the chicago and d.c.bans didn’t work is because it’s so easy to go and get access to guns in other places. %$* 61
well here you have ideal situations, you have island nations, where it’s relatively easy and go and enforce the borders and protect them. %$* 61
and yet they’ve seen huge increases in the numbers of illegal guns, because essentially all of them are illegal after these bans go into effect. %$* 61
and yet just as we see here in the uk if you look at ireland or jamaica or other places, you see time after time increases in robbery and murder rates and violent crimes. %$* 61
now one thing people often do is they look across countries and they say well, look, england has a relatively low gun ownership rate, it has a relatively high murder rate even if their violent crime rate is twice what we are in the united states. %$* 61
and they may point to japan or germany or other countries, and they say the united states has more guns, more violent crime. %$* 61
but the thing they have to take into account is these other countries had much, much lower violent crime rates prior to bans going into effect. %$* 61
in 1900 for example in england, in london, a city of millions of people, with no gun regulations, you had two gun murders, and five armed gun robberies that took place. %$* 61
and, what you see time after time when these bans go into effect, either violent crime rates no longer drop, or they begin to start to go up, as you’ve seen in england and other countries. %$* 61
probably one of the most controversial things we could talk about are gun-free zones that we have in the united states for things like schools or other places. %$* 61
and we hear about these things, they, they dominate the news. %$* 61
but yet one fact doesn’t go out, you cannot find one of these multiple-victim shootings in the united states that occur, that takes place in—where more than three people are killed, that doesn’t take place in a gun-free zone where civilians are banned from owning guns. %$* 61
you want to make places safer. %$* 61
banning guns you think are the easy solution to that. %$* 61
but again if you pass a ban and it’s the law-abiding good citizens who obey the ban and not the criminals, rather than making it safe for the would-be victims you may unintentionally make it safe for the criminals who are intent on trying to harm others and make less for them to worry about, thank you. %$* 61
thank you, john lott. %$* 13
one of the safest major cities in the united states is seattle, thanks in great measure to the work done by its police force, under the leadership of a chief who has led the city to a 40-year low in violence. %$* 13
that said, problems persist there as everywhere else, especially among young offenders, a point brought home to the chief of police in seattle, after, in an anecdote he shared with us, he was doing some after- christmas day shopping at a mall and when he returned to his car it had been broken into, and the one item stolen from his car was his gun. %$* 13
it’s firsthand experience, and, certainly of everyone on our panel, no one has more actual firsthand experience dealing with guns and crime than the chief of police of seattle, gil kerlikowske. %$* 13
thank you, john, thank you. %$* 62
well, it’s a pleasure to be here with you, i was worried that they wouldn’t bring that story out and i wanted to make sure that i did full disclosure and %$* 62
‘course i also appreciate the seattle-like weather during the last couple days. %$* 62
let me give you a perspective from a police chief’s point of view. %$* 62
first of all you have to understand that the position of police chief is not, whether it’s ray kelly, the great police commissioner in new york city, myself or others, we all actually worked our way up through the ranks. %$* 62
a puff of white smoke didn’t emanate from city hall and suddenly we became anointed with these positions. %$* 62
all of us worked as police officers and detectives and sergeants, et cetera, so we kind of understand some of the nitty-gritty, although the television shows here in new york are so much better. %$* 62
the right to—in seattle we’d have latte stories or something. %$* 62
but the right to own and possess a gun in this country isn’t a debatable issue and it’s not the topic. %$* 62
reasonableness though, and common sense do come into play. %$* 62
i’m not a researcher and i am certainly not going to play a researcher for this debate tonight, but i do want to cite a couple things because it provides a framework for you, but it also puts into my perspective 36 years of law enforcement experience. %$* 62
this is work done by phil cook. %$* 62
so the rates of assault, robbery and rape will not noticeably be affected by more guns. %$* 62
increase in the secondary market of guns, will occur. %$* 62
what is it in the secondary market? %$* 62
loans to and from family members of firearms, off-the-book sales, meaning that there was no background check. %$* 62
thefts of guns which, it was mentioned, i am personally familiar with. %$* 62
the percent of suicide with guns is highly correlated with the prevalence of gun ownership, and the murder rate in large counties is closely linked to gun prevalence. %$* 62
an increase in the gun murder rate would be expected, but there was no effect on the non-gun murder rate. %$* 62
so you’re going hear from the other side about the deterrence effect, and in fact john already brought a little bit about that up. %$* 62
more people carrying more guns will deter criminals. %$* 62
in other words the criminals will think twice before confronting a potential victim. %$* 62
i wish criminals were that smart. %$* 62
on the other hand i’m glad that they’re not that smart, because that’s why we catch so many of them all the time. %$* 62
since we have almost, in the neighborhood of 240 million guns in the united states, i would think that these criminals would already get the message that there are a lot of guns out there and that if deterrence was in fact carried through that we would’ve seen it by now, but we haven’t. %$* 62
the other side of this coin is, will more armed citizens have an opposite effect on criminals. %$* 62
in other words, are the criminals going to now arm themselves thinking that more and more and more people are carrying guns. %$* 62
well, the union that represents the british bobbies, who have been unarmed since sir robert peel founded them, their union went forward and said look, we do not want to be armed as bobbies in the uk.now this was during a time of significant increases in crime, increases in knife crime which is still going on. %$* 62
but they asked not to be armed. %$* 62
now there are some specialized units certainly, called armed response cars, et cetera. %$* 62
but for the vast majority of the bobbies in all of the uk they are not armed and they don’t want to be because, one, they think it will only increase assaults on themselves, and that it will be a tit-for-tat or a proliferation of guns in the uk.which like rabies they have very few of. %$* 62
who is carrying a gun now in this country in the united states, well of course law enforcement officers, state, federal, local. %$* 62
and, security guards, security guards across all walks of life from banks to armored-car services, literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that are already carrying guns. %$* 62
and then there’s a whole ‘nother group of people, and those are the people that are able to go into their states, and ask for a concealed firearms permit. %$* 62
there is a background check, it depends on the state, on what’s done. %$* 62
but essentially they say look, i sell jewelry or i have a business that’s been robbed, or, you know what, i want to be able to carry a gun like in florida. %$* 62
and they’ll be able to carry a firearm as a concealed firearm. %$* 62
here’s the big unknown, here’s where research has not actually answered this question. %$* 62
all of these hundreds of thousands of cops out there and security guards and citizens who have concealed firearms permits, how many are actually carrying a gun? %$* 62
they may have the permits, they may have the authority. %$* 62
when you’re a new police officer, you’re usually armed to the teeth, and within a few days or months or years or whatever, you oftentimes don’t carry a gun. %$* 62
it used to be that you were required in police departments across the country to be armed whenever you were out and about, off-duty or on. %$* 62
very few departments have those rules anymore. %$* 62
because the gun is difficult to conceal, it is uncomfortable and it is difficult to secure. %$* 62
so when we think of all the people that are actually out there, how many are actually armed. %$* 62
we don’t know. %$* 62
now whenever somebody gives you a simple solution to a complex problem, we all know that you can be assured of one thing, it’s wrong. %$* 62
and so after all of the different campus shootings that we have talked about and read about, just recently of course in arkansas, we hear this hue and cry, well, the students should be armed, or the students and the faculty should be armed. %$* 62
and the outcome as one academic told me, there is one sure outcome of arming the college students and that would be grade inflation. %$* 62
the last thing that i’ll mention—let me close with this. %$* 62
when i was a young officer, working the street in st. %$* 62
petersburg-- %$* 62
retired people, a lot of them from new york in fact-- %$* 62
a young woman, 15 years old, intoxicated, beating and beating and beating on the front door of an elderly couple who had no phone. %$* 62
they became more and more and more afraid, but she had been there beating on the door. %$* 62
he turned to the thing that he felt could protect him the most, even though she was unable of course to get in, and she was just really an intoxicated kid beating on the front door. %$* 62
he fired through the door and struck her. %$* 62
a girl about the age that his granddaughter could or would have been. %$* 62
and i remember going to the hospital and seeing her there, and i remember the family that lived, that husband and wife in st. %$* 62
petersburg for many, many years. %$* 62
there are lots of cases in which these guns could protect you, there are far more cases in which the gun does not. %$* 62
thank you. %$* 62
thank you, gil kerlikowske, arguing against the motion. %$* 13
not many lawyers get to argue before the supreme court ever in their careers, much less get to bat .1000 when they do so. %$* 13
as a lawyer representing the national rifle association, stephen halbrook has gone 3-for-3 before the supreme court in arguing firearms cases on behalf of the nra. he is on our stage tonight to argue in this debate for the motion, “guns reduce crime.” stephen? %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 63
thank you. %$* 63
it’s a real pleasure to be here, i think one of the remarks that gil just made, shows the difference between our country and england, historically, not just today. %$* 63
our country was founded when the british government had a policy of colonialism in which it sought to exploit the americans, to tax them without representation, and when the americans protested there was an escalation, and the british sought to disarm the americans that led to violence, because the americans thought this is our only chance to protect ourselves. %$* 63
when you look at a debate topic like this, “guns reduce crime,” for and against, let’s define our terms a little bit, guns possessed by who. %$* 63
guns possessed by law-abiding citizens reduce crime but not guns possessed by criminals, and, what does crime mean, we look at the term crime i think in a—we should look at it in a very broad way. %$* 63
crime means the unjust aggression against life, liberty, and property, of another person. %$* 63
so crime can be committed. %$* 63
singly by one person against another or, in small groups by a gang of criminals against another. %$* 63
or at the highest level it can be committed by governments. %$* 63
when we look at the problem of genocide, the problem of crimes against humanity, these are major crimes involving large populations frequently in which guns are used unjustly and there’s an ability to do that on behalf of authoritarian or police states because the population is disarmed. %$* 63
so, when we look at this issue we should look at not just here and now, what happens in the united states, or what’s happened in the last decade or two, or what happens today, but look at it historically in terms of what sorts of societies have existed historically and which ones have balance and democracy and republicanism and which ones are the kinds of states that you don’t wanna live in, nazi germany, uganda under idi amin or cambodia under the khmer rouge, i mean—this is real. %$* 63
we live in a society that’s very nice right now, it’s not guaranteed that it’ll always be that way, either, in terms of your own personal life or in terms of the possibility that a government could turn bad. %$* 63
what i think we’re advocating tonight, those of us on the side of the proposition, is that you should have freedom of choice to protect yourself if you decide to do that. %$* 63
one of the questions that was asked recently in the us supreme court, the district of columbia was trying to defend its handgun ban and they said that it’s okay to ban handguns and that all guns should have trigger locks and be disassembled and never loaded. %$* 63
and one of the supreme court justices asked the question, well what if you hear the door crash in and you’re fumbling for your reading glasses and trying to turn on the lamp and your hands are trembling %$* 63
maybe it would be a good idea to have a gun available if something like that happened so, the question is not whether everybody should have a gun, but the question is should you have the ability to exercise that freedom of choice if you are a responsible citizen, and that’s your decision to do so. %$* 63
our american revolution proved the ability of an armed populace basically to defeat a tyranny and that’s why we ended up in our bill of rights with the right of the people to keep and bear arms, the declaration that it shall not be infringed, and also a declaration in favor of a militia because that enhanced the security of a free state, security means that a free state is preserved as a viable political entity, it has republican institutions and people themselves are able to dissuade tyranny, they’re able to fight individual criminals. %$* 63
it was always considered to be a responsibility of individuals to, in the ancient hue and cry and the watch and ward, to, if criminals were on the loose, to try to catch them. %$* 63
and now we have degenerated somewhat into a society, where you don’t help anybody, and we have many instances where criminals are attacking people and nobody basically gives a damn. %$* 63
basically it comes back to freedom of choice, i’d like to use a couple of maybe legal cases, to illustrate the point. %$* 63
you’ve heard d.c.became the murder capitol of the united states after it enacted a handgun ban. %$* 63
there’s no duty of the police to protect you, it’s not just impossible for them to do so, it’s not a legal duty. %$* 63
right before the handgun ban in d.c.was enacted, there were three women who were in a boarding house, and they were broken into. %$* 63
and there were two individuals who, over a period of many, many hours, raped and robbed and otherwise assaulted them. %$* 63
they called 911 several times, and the police would come knock on the door and nobody would respond. %$* 63
the police would drive by the house, because these ladies made repeated calls to 911.and so this ordeal, this nightmare finally ended, and they sued the dc government. %$* 63
and the courts ruled that there is no duty of government to protect any individual person. %$* 63
they have a duty to society at large, which is just kind of a useless concept when you're an individual and you're a crime victim. %$* 63
so there’s no duty to protect you. %$* 63
and then the question becomes, well, maybe you would like to protect yourself. %$* 63
maybe you would like to at least have the legal right to do that. %$* 63
and that’s what the second amendment is partly intended to guarantee. %$* 63
that’s what the supreme court just held in dc versus heller that we do have an individual right to keep and bear arms. %$* 63
and it’s a right. %$* 63
it’s not something you have to do. %$* 63
it’s not a duty. %$* 63
but it’s something that you can do. %$* 63
i represented a group of litigants in a companion case, and they live in the ghetto in dc, they're victims of robberies, house break-ins. %$* 63
this happened repeatedly. %$* 63
and they were good citizens, and they simply wanted access to guns. %$* 63
the same thing could be illustrated in hurricane katrina where the police chief announced no law abiding citizen could have guns, and basically they, the police themselves disarmed individual citizens. %$* 63
and we see the result of that. %$* 63
but if you went across the river into algiers, the community known as algiers, citizens armed themselves, they provided their own arms, and they kept violence down, they kept looting down. %$* 63
the same thing happened in the la riots, and the same thing happened in hurricane andrew in florida. %$* 63
there was no police protection, no national guard protection for several days. %$* 63
armed citizens came forward and basically made sure that there was no looting, and no robberies, and no murders proceeding. %$* 63
so, the bottom line is, we don’t have the same system as england. %$* 63
you didn't hear gil announce that the seattle police force should disarm themselves. %$* 63
to the contrary, we should have armed police forces, and we should have that right to be exercised by individual citizens. %$* 63
thank you. %$* 63
thank you, stephen halbrook. %$* 13
we are halfway through our opening section of opening statements. %$* 13
and for people who may just be joining the radio broadcast, or who came in late, i'm going to say the following. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news, and this is intelligence squared us, oxford style debating brought to american shores. %$* 13
we have six panelists on the stage, three for, and three against the motion “guns reduce crime.” we are halfway through our opening statements, and now let’s let the debate continue. %$* 13
we are all wise enough in the ways of the world to know that the statement “statistics never lie” is a lie. %$* 13
the point being that honest scholars can look at the same numbers and disagree profoundly about what they mean. %$* 13
we heard from john lott, whose specialty is looking at the statistics of gun crime. %$* 13
we are now going to be hearing from john donohue, who is also a numbers man, but who looks at the numbers and comes up with dramatically different points of view on guns and crime. %$* 13
and through the academic journals, the two john’s have something of a feud going. %$* 13
if you want to look up the journals-- %$* 13
some of which we may touch on tonight. %$* 13
but introducing you, as our next speaker, against the motion “guns reduce crime,” john donohue. %$* 13
thank you very much, it’s a great pleasure to be with you tonight. %$* 64
well you mention a feud, i am a peaceful man, but let me just say that everything that you’ve heard from john in terms of the statistical claims are subject to serious challenge and refutation. %$* 64
quickly, on the dc handgun ban issue, keep in mind that it was a dc handgun ban. %$* 64
you could still have a shotgun in your home. %$* 64
so if you needed to be protected in your home %$* 64
the only thing that they were trying to take away was handguns, because those are the guns most preferred by criminals. %$* 64
but, if you look at the numbers that john had put up, which was interesting, if he had actually showed you the number of murders in dc, they had actually dropped. %$* 64
he showed you the rate. %$* 64
and what was interesting about that was, dc was de-populating tremendously in the seventies, and it was largely the flight of the affluent. %$* 64
so, the group that had the lowest likelihood of engaging in crime. %$* 64
so, crime was going to be, if you used the rates that john showed, it was going to be trending up, because the people remaining in the city had a much, much higher risk of crime. %$* 64
and so, when you make those adjustments, the conclusions are opposite to what john suggested. %$* 64
if you went for a number of years you’d see there was a huge run up in crime in dc, as there was in chicago, and philadelphia, and new york for that matter. %$* 64
but it had nothing to do with the topic we’re talking about. %$* 64
that was crack cocaine, which had a tremendous criminogenic influence on crime. %$* 64
the final thing to mention about dc handgun ban, is whatever it says about that particular experience, remember, dc is right across from virginia, where there are plenty of guns. %$* 64
so, the story that john tries to tell you may tell you something about gun control in that urban environment, but it’s not a story about the value of guns. %$* 64
everyone concedes that guns in the hands of the right person at the right time can reduce crime. %$* 64
that's why, as we heard, armed police and security guards are a good thing. %$* 64
if you go to a maximum security prison, the prison guards don’t have guns, because there are times when guns are good, and there are times when guns are bad. %$* 64
prison guards, you might think, would want to have guns, but they know those guns would be taken away in a heartbeat by the criminals who are behind bars, so therefore you don’t see it. %$* 64
if you could expand the population in a cautious way to those who are unquestionably law abiding, and a cautious population, sure, there can be benefits there. %$* 64
but, the idea that, john lott, and you will hear gary kleck argue that guns are being used constantly to thwart, um, criminals by these gun- toting citizens is grotesquely misleading. %$* 64
john gave a number, two million. %$* 64
gary kleck has at times said there are two point five million defensive uses of handguns each year. %$* 64
it’s a complete fantasy because gun ownership is so prevalent in this country, criminals know that all they have to do is wait for the family to leave and go to work, or to school, and then they can just walk in and grab the guns. %$* 64
and that happens five hundred thousand to a million times per year. %$* 64
so by virtue of our prevalence of guns, we are giving great aid and comfort to the criminal population, because they can walk in, take those guns. %$* 64
there was a wonderful sixty minutes documentary a number of years ago designed to show you how you could protect your house from a burglar. %$* 64
and they had an active burglar showing how quickly he could get in the house. %$* 64
and when he got in, mike wallace asked him, well, what’s the first thing you do when you get in the house? %$* 64
and he said, look for the guns. %$* 64
they're gold to criminals, and that’s why they go in and get them. %$* 64
so, whatever benefit we get from scaring off, or even shooting a small number of criminals, it’s offset by the fact that five times as many guns will be handed over to a criminal, in effect, because the criminals will be taking that gun from the previously law-abiding citizen. %$* 64
now, john and i have debated on the issue of right to carry laws, laws that say citizens who have not yet been convicted of a felony, or not yet been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital should be allowed to carry a gun wherever they want. %$* 64
john thinks this is a great idea, offers statistics to prove it. %$* 64
let me just mention that in texas, even if you have been committed to a mental hospital, if you can get a note from your doctor, they’ll give you that concealed handgun permit. %$* 64
north dakota really set a new low. %$* 64
they actually gave one of these permits to a blind permit holder. %$* 64
this is, to be frank, insanity. %$* 64
now, i published a number of econometric studies, and virtually every top econometrician who has looked at this has sided with me, and not with john lott. %$* 64
the national academy of sciences convened a panel of talented experts who spent two years looking at john lott’s work, gary kleck’s work. %$* 64
they came before the committee, testified, fifteen to one in that panel of sixteen, they concluded the scientific evidence does not support the more guns, less crime proposition. %$* 64
the lone dissenter was someone who was not an econometrician, who admitted in his dissent that he wished he knew more econometrics, and who had previously testified as an expert witness on behalf of the nra.the other fifteen members of the committee responded to his dissent saying, quote, the scientific evidence does not support his position. %$* 64
let me just note what the nra tries to tell you about all sorts of things. %$* 64
this is a picture of something that you can buy on the nra web site. %$* 64
it’s a picture showing the second amendment. %$* 64
and note the way they drape the gun across the page. %$* 64
it’s obscuring the first half of the second amendment which starts off saying “a well regulated militia.” that’s because they would try to have you believe that was not part of the constitution, the idea of regulation being very central, because it’s the first phrase in the constitutional amendment that they're talking about. %$* 64
now, if the nra can't be trusted to tell you the truth on something that’s been on black and white paper for two hundred years, how likely is it that they're going to be able to tell you the truth on the complicated issues of evaluating what he impact of these laws are. %$* 64
it’s a complete absurdity to think you're going to get the true story from the nra and their close allies. %$* 64
thank you. %$* 64
thank you, john donohue. %$* 13
when it comes to hot button issues, we like to have easy pigeon holes to put people in. %$* 13
but our next speaker makes it difficult. %$* 13
a professor of criminology at florida state, he is, let’s see, a democrat, a member of the aclu, a member of amnesty international. %$* 13
he describes himself as an environmental tree-hugger. %$* 13
however, when it comes to this issue, this classic liberal is defying all expectations by arguing what is normally considered the conservative side. %$* 13
gary kleck, arguing for the motion that “guns reduce crime.” %$* 13
and yes, i'm going to vote for barack obama too. %$* 65
thank you, john, and thank you all for coming out on this very nasty night. %$* 65
that is indeed an accurate rendition of my background. %$* 65
the moral of that particular story is, i didn't come to this pro side of this debate via my ideology. %$* 65
it’s the most unnatural thing in the world, from that standpoint. %$* 65
i didn't come to that position by virtue of my social background. %$* 65
i grew up in the wilds of suburbia, basically, where guns are scarce. %$* 65
they don’t have guns to commit crimes, they don’t have guns to defend against crimes, they don’t have guns for hunting, they don’t have guns. %$* 65
my way into this position is basically evidence-based. %$* 65
i'm boringly scholarly. %$* 65
i’ve been studying this issue for nearly thirty years, i’ve written three books, dozens of articles. %$* 65
i’ve published more articles on the effects of defensive use of guns than anyone else. %$* 65
oddly enough, sometimes what you can learn from a debate is by listening to the silences, paying attention to what people would be expected to talk about, but don’t. %$* 65
strictly speaking, the other side actually hasn’t addressed the issue of the effectiveness of defensive gun use. %$* 65
they’ve kind of danced around it, but they haven't actually addressed it head on, and in fact, the organization paul helmke represents, the brady campaign, previously handgun control incorporated, used to have a very prominent segment of their web site devoted to the proposition that, no, if you try to use a gun for self-protection, you're going to get yourself killed, or injured, or it’s going to be taken away and used against you. %$* 65
and they’ve more or less stopped talking about it, they're just silent on the issue. %$* 65
that's significant. %$* 65
the reason is, the evidence is unanimous, it’s rare in criminological research for the findings to be unanimous on anything, but they're unanimous on this one. %$* 65
defensive gun use is effective in the sense that crime victims who use guns during a crime are less likely to be injured or killed, and less likely to lose property than crime victims who adopt any other kind of strategy, including non-resistance. %$* 65
non-resistance is not the safest course of action. %$* 65
and this is so despite the fact that usually when people try to use guns for self-protection, they're doing it under tougher circumstances. %$* 65
they do it not because they're quick on the trigger, but because they're facing really desperate circumstances, they're likely to be outnumbered, they're likelier to be facing offenders with weapons, including guns, than other victims. %$* 65
they're more likely than other victims to have already been injured. %$* 65
and out of desperation, with all of these handicaps against them, then they use guns in an attempt to defend themselves, and from that point on they are not hurt. %$* 65
much of the research that previously claimed that, if you tried to use a gun you’d only get hurt, it had a simple error in the research that everybody here can understand. %$* 65
it was an error in terms of what happened first. %$* 65
researchers would report that there were many incidents in which people were injured, and they used guns defensively. %$* 65
what they didn't know, and it turned out once the error was corrected in the research, those were always cases where somebody was first injured, and then used the gun for self protection. %$* 65
it wasn’t using the gun that got them hurt, it was getting hurt that finally pushed them into using the gun. %$* 65
when they fixed that flaw in the research, they basically found that once people used guns for self protection, they are almost never injured after that point. %$* 65
there’s good reason why the chief’s police officers carry guns. %$* 65
they're effective for self protection, but it doesn't require the unique training and experience of police officers for it to be effective. %$* 65
it’s effective basically for everybody. %$* 65
you may not have noticed, but there’s actually more consensus among the six of us than might be evident at first. %$* 65
i don’t think anybody really disputes the proposition that the effects of guns depends on who has them. %$* 65
i haven't heard anybody on the other side say that guns in the hands of non-criminals are just as bad in the hands of criminals. %$* 65
it makes a huge difference. %$* 65
basically, guns in the hands of non-criminals, or in the hands of victims, regardless of any prior criminal behavior, reduce violence. %$* 65
they reduce it in the sense that, once the gun is introduced by the victim, the offender stops aggressing. %$* 65
period. %$* 65
furthermore, defensive gun use is extremely common, contrary to professor donohue’s claims, it’s not sheer fantasy that leads us to believe that there are on the order of two million defensive gun uses a year. %$* 65
it’s simply probability sampling surveys of the same sort that gallop and harris and every major survey organization uses. %$* 65
you just ask people questions. %$* 65
you're not going to hear about these defensive gun uses from your newspaper, nor are the police going to hear about them because frankly, if you had been a crime victim who used a gun for self protection in a typical situation, you’d be insane to report it to the police. %$* 65
and of course if the police don’t hear about it, neither will your local newspapers. %$* 65
at best, maybe you’d be arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm, because most of these uses occur in public places where you're not supposed to have a gun, unless you have a special carry permit. %$* 65
at worst what can happen is you can be arrested for the, the assault itself, a criminal assault. %$* 65
it may well be somewhere down the road, after you’ve gone through a legal nightmare, that you're cleared of these charges, but in the meanwhile you can be bankrupted from the legal expenses, and have your reputation ruined, and nobody reads it on page eighteen that, oh yeah, you know, joe smith was cleared of those charges. %$* 65
so you're not going to hear about it from police statistics, yet scientifically conducted, objectively conducted surveys have, in at least twenty consecutive surveys, found that defensive gun use is not just common, it’s more common than criminal use is. %$* 65
and so that’s not a fantasy, as professor donohue would have you believe, it’s about as firmly established a fact as we have to go on in this area. %$* 65
thank you very much. %$* 65
thank you, gary kleck. %$* 13
another defier of easy pigeon-holing is the man who is president of the brady center to prevent gun violence, an organization that is the forefront of the gun control movement. %$* 13
he is a republican, and he is the former mayor of indianapolis. %$* 13
he has said that his position on gun control had a lot to do with nearly losing two close friends in a gun accident. %$* 13
this was during the time when they were all teenagers together. %$* 13
now, all of these years later, we are pleased to introduce as our final speaker, and speaking against the motion that “guns reduce crime,” paul helmke. %$* 13
it’s great to be here tonight. %$* 66
i'm, just for the record, i was mayor of fort wayne, indiana, not indianapolis, but another great city in the state of indiana. %$* 66
i came to this issue as a mayor. %$* 66
not only had i had the experience, when i was a teenager, of seeing a friend get a bullet in the back because of the all too common incident of, we found a gun, we didn't know it was loaded, which happens every day in this country. %$* 66
but as a mayor, i saw what happens in a community when there are so many guns, and when we make it so easy for dangerous people to get guns. %$* 66
i had police officers, one case i still remember well, i got the call in the middle of the night from the police chief, our labor relations director, a police chief, married to a police officer, they kept a gun at their headboard. %$* 66
they wanted to be safe. %$* 66
they knew how to use the gun. %$* 66
they were police officers. %$* 66
they had a fight, domestic quarrel. %$* 66
she ended up dead. %$* 66
that happens a lot in this country. %$* 66
actually, the statistics show that if you’ve got a gun in your home, it’s twenty-two times more likely to be used against you or a family member than to protect you. %$* 66
think about that again. %$* 66
twenty-two times more likely. %$* 66
and part of the reason is that the world doesn't easily divide into the good guys and bad guys, because there’s always sort of a chance that any of us can get angry, any of us can get drunk, and if the gun is there, what’s going to happen with that gun? %$* 66
when you look at the arguments for the proponents here, basically they talk about these two million defensive uses, and as professor donohue said, that’s a questionable number. %$* 66
yes, it was based on probability sampling. %$* 66
there were sixty-six people who responded to a poll that said they used a gun defensively. %$* 66
sixty-six, and then you extrapolate that by the adult population of the us, and you get two million gun uses. %$* 66
just sixty-six. %$* 66
when you do sampling and have such a small affirmative number, and then you multiply it by huge things, you get these outrageous things. %$* 66
based on that, more people have been in flying saucers in this country. %$* 66
it shows what happens with statistics. %$* 66
actually, when i was running for mayor of fort wayne, i learned quickly how statistics-- %$* 66
how it works. %$* 66
i was running against an incumbent. %$* 66
i looked at what had happened in crime in my community, and there had been times when crime went up. %$* 66
and so i'm digging out the statistics. %$* 66
the police chief at one time said, yes, crime was up because the economy was down. %$* 66
people lost their jobs, they were going to commit crimes. %$* 66
then i found another clip from two years later, he said, well, crime is up because the economy is good, more people have things to steal. %$* 66
you can take statistics and do whatever you want with them so many times. %$* 66
the one statistic that doesn't lie are deaths. %$* 66
you have to do probability sampling for these other things, but when you look at deaths, you get the shocking statistics. %$* 66
that thirty-two people are killed with guns, murdered with guns every day in this country. %$* 66
that’s a virginia tech happening every day in this country. %$* 66
thirty thousand people die from guns every year. %$* 66
that includes the suicides and the accidents. %$* 66
you get the situation like just a couple days ago in massachusetts, some kid is shooting a machine gun at some gun show, and he kills himself because he can't hold it. %$* 66
what is going wrong with this country? %$* 66
thirty thousand deaths. %$* 66
and then when you combine the seventy thousand people that are injured every year, people like jim brady, who, by the way, was with president reagan at the time, surrounded by people with guns, the secret service. %$* 66
that didn't stop them from getting shot. %$* 66
those guns didn't reduce that crime. %$* 66
the other argument that the proponents seem to make, is they're holding up this straw man of the gun bans, and how gun bans don’t work. %$* 66
and you can argue the statistics. %$* 66
actually, after dc had their hand gun ban, gun suicides went down twenty-three percent, gun homicides went down twenty-five percent when you looked at a ten year period. %$* 66
so, there’s a lot of statistics there. %$* 66
but the real issue is not gun bans. %$* 66
we're not talking about gun bans, we’re talking about the question, do more guns reduce crime? %$* 66
and it’s clear that the more guns you get out there, the more likely those guns are going to be stolen. %$* 66
where do you think the criminals get these guns? %$* 66
that these guns are going to be trafficked. %$* 66
where do you think the criminals get these guns? %$* 66
misused? %$* 66
where do you think accidents happen from? %$* 66
used in road rage. %$* 66
used in the domestic violence situation. %$* 66
it’s the guns that add to the problem. %$* 66
other countries in the world have the same level, generally, of rapes, and of burglaries, and of robberies, and of assaults that we do, industrialized countries. %$* 66
but we are far and away the most deadly country when it comes to gun crime, because we have so many guns. %$* 66
in fact, if you think about it for a second, if the proposition were true that guns reduce crime, we should be the safest country in the world, and we’re not. %$* 66
and it’s because we do have so many guns, and those guns too easily get in the wrong hands. %$* 66
and actually, when you think about this proposition, rather than voting to say that guns reduce crime, you should stop and think that really restricting access to guns is what would reduce crime. %$* 66
we’re coming up on the fifteen year anniversary of the brady bill. %$* 66
the brady bill said, instead of taking an individual’s word whether they're a felon or mentally dangerous, let’s do a background check. %$* 66
the brady-- %$* 66
you know, bright idea, right? %$* 66
don’t just say, are you a felon? %$* 66
no, of course not. %$* 66
you know, it’s a %$* 66
the brady background check system has stopped one point six million people from buying guns who weren't allowed to buy guns. %$* 66
we had a situation just last week in virginia where somebody went in to buy a gun, turns out there’s a murder warrant for them in baltimore, and the person got arrested. %$* 66
you know, criminals, like the chief said, aren't always the brightest people in the world. %$* 66
in fact, this guy tried to argue, well, i didn't commit the murder, i wouldn't have gone and bought a gun if i %$* 66
it didn't make any sense. %$* 66
brady background checks work. %$* 66
if we decide that some people are probably more prone to violence, again, people with a felony record, people that are dangerously mentally ill, let’s stop them from buying those guns, let’s use background checks, let’s have them in all sales, not just from federally licensed dealers. %$* 66
let’s do things to stop gun trafficking. %$* 66
do you realize that you can go in and buy eighty- one of the same make and model of a gun tomorrow, and what do you think is going to happen when someone did that in charlie brown’s gun store in dayton, ohio a few years back, eighty-one of the same make and model? %$* 66
they sell them out of the trunk of their car. %$* 66
people don’t realize how weak our gun laws are in this country. %$* 66
we basically allow almost anyone to get any kind of a gun. %$* 66
last thing i wanted to comment on is the supreme court case. %$* 66
the supreme court case, while making it clear that gun bans are off the table, made it clear that we can have reasonable restrictions, that we can restrict who gets the guns, where they take the guns, how the guns are sold, how the guns are stored, and what, and all the things that deal with guns. %$* 66
that’s where this debate should come down. %$* 66
i'm not anti-gun. %$* 66
i’ve got my nra pro-marksmanship badge from when i was in sixth grade. %$* 66
my friends all went hunting and did these things too. %$* 66
but once you see how easy we make it for dangerous people to get guns, you’ll conclude that you should vote against the proposition. %$* 66
thank you. %$* 66
thank you, paul helmke, and i apologize to the people of fort wayne, indiana. %$* 13
the mistake was mine alone, but i'm very much reminded of the fact that we are not in indiana, that we are in new york city, because we have the numbers in. %$* 13
polling the audience before the debate on the motion, and we’re going to put them up on the screen now, the motion being “guns reduce crime.” thirteen percent of you supported this motion before the debate, sixty percent of you opposed the motion, and twenty- seven percent were undecided. %$* 13
we’ll be polling you again toward the end of the debate to see whether any minds have been changed. %$* 13
we’re going to begin the section now, where the debaters address one another and also take questions from you, the audience. %$* 13
and again, i would very much encourage any of you who are here to participate. %$* 13
if you have expertise in the field, that is so much the better. %$* 13
again, we would encourage you to keep your questions exceedingly short. %$* 13
what you need to do is raise your hand, and we have ushers who are moving around the aisles, and will come to you, and locate you. %$* 13
but i just want to go to john lott, who, in a sense, your work embodies this motion that guns reduce crime, and your statistical work embodies that motion. %$* 13
and yet tonight i heard some of the fundamental work you’re done referred to as a fantasy. %$* 13
and i heard the question raised by former mayor helmke, if guns prevent crime, why isn't this the most safe nation in the world? %$* 13
what is the answer to that, and what about the fantasy issue? %$* 13
well, i mean, there are lots of academics that have, i’ll just take the fantasy issue first. %$* 61
there are lots of academics who have looked at the relationship between concealed hand gun laws and crime rates, and if you look at papers published in refereed academic journals by economists and criminologists, you’ll find about seventy percent of them find that when right to carry laws get passed, there’s drops in violent crime rates. %$* 61
about thirty percent say there’s no change that’s there. %$* 61
and then there’s not one refereed academic journal that i know of that finds that there’s a bad effect from these. %$* 61
so there’s a lot of people that looked at this in many different ways. %$* 61
john, john, you're ignoring the national academy of science panel— %$* 64
i'm happy to— %$* 61
15 to one, including some of the top econometricians in the country— %$* 64
right. %$* 61
—and their conclusion was your work is not supported by the scientific evidence. %$* 64
not true, we’re experts on it, their opinions on that issue have absolutely nothing to do with it, john’s talking about what experts thought. %$* 65
but the promise— %$* 61
and the real debate is simply between people who say there is a beneficial effect, versus those who say there’s no effect. %$* 65
there basically is no, no participation on john’s side, on john donohue’s side. %$* 65
basically there is no support for the view it has counterproductive violence-elevating effects. %$* 65
but just to respond to the national academy of sciences, i mean, unfortunately i think, there’s a problem with government getting involved in evaluating research, and it’s very hard for the government to keep politics out of it. %$* 61
this was a panel set up by the clinton administration; i don’t think it was unbiased— %$* 61
this was not a panel set up by the clinton administration— %$* 64
it was started there. %$* 61
but the point is, what james q.wilson, who’s this hack that you were referring to, and i think a lot of people would regard james q.wilson as probably the top criminologist in the country, he was the person who was dissenting on this. %$* 61
and what %$* 61
jim showed, was that if you look at every single one of the national academy of sciences estimates on the impact of right-to-carry laws on murder rates, every single one of their own estimates showed that right-to-carry laws reduced murder rates. %$* 61
and if you looked at their other things, virtually all their other estimates for all the other types of crimes showed reductions in those also— %$* 61
john, i have the report— %$* 64
there was no estimate— %$* 61
i have the report right here— %$* 64
—not one estimate, that the national— %$* 61
i have the report right in front of me, and it does not support what you just said. %$* 64
is it true or is it not true that every regression, every estimate that they had on right-to-carry and murder showed a drop. %$* 61
is there one estimate they showed that it didn't fall? %$* 61
yeah— %$* 64
statistically— %$* 61
yeah, there are some, not— maybe not statistically significant, but— but, the bottom line, john, is, as the panel suggested, the elephant in the room was crack cocaine. %$* 64
the states that did not pass the right-to-carry laws were states that had a big problem with crack cocaine which had an enormous influence in running up crime. %$* 64
now, that’s— %$* 61
the rural states that did pass these laws did not experience the big run-up in crime, and when you do your analysis, it is the difference between the flat performance in the rural states, and the increases in crime that generates that result. %$* 64
that’s why— %$* 64
that’s simply not true— %$* 61
—james q. wilson was outvoted 15 to 1. %$* 64
look— %$* 61
okay, i—i think we have impasse on this %$* 13
and i— i wanna go to chief kerlikowske, seattle police chief, because you were talking about british bobbies being unarmed, and preferring that in many situations because they felt being armed would invite assault, and yet gary kleck arguing for the motion said why are police armed in the first place unless it is to deter assault, do you—can you take that on? %$* 13
yes i can, and, remember what truman said, if i could line up all the economists end to end, wouldn’t that be a beautiful sight, so that, i just— and one, and one is on my panel. %$* 62

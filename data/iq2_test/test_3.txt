tonight we have a partner, a new partner in this. %$* 13
we are sharing credit with the fact that we're putting this debate on with columbia university's richard paul richmond center for business law and public policy. %$* 13
that-- %$* 13
i can see the spontaneous applause thing is going to work really well. %$* 13
i do want to say that it's a joint venture of the law school and the business school. %$* 13
and they have, as we do, a goal of trying to raise the level of public discourse, in their case where law, and markets, and business intersect. %$* 13
so, again, i thank you, let's give them a round of applause-- %$* 13
the other reason we have these debates, of course, is because of the rosenkranz foundation, which launched them six years ago and sponsored them, and i want a welcome now to help us frame the debate and talk about why we're doing this by inviting onto the stage the chairman of the board of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
so, bob, as i always ask you before these debates, why this one and why now? %$* 13
well, the reason why now is because the theme of taxes and tax policy has been a very divisive theme throughout the presidential campaign and the presidential debates, and we're trying to bring this to a-- %$* 1
perhaps more sophisticated level here tonight. %$* 1
and this motion has a tricky word, "enough," what do we intend by putting the word, "enough," into this motion? %$* 13
well, i thought really that there would be three criteria by which one might decide that. %$* 1
one is the matter of fairness, one is efficiency, and one is sufficiency. %$* 1
okay, take us through fairness, what it means for each side. %$* 13
well, for the pro the motion side, fairness would be the point of view of somebody in the top 1 percent who's paying 40 percent of all the taxes in america or the top 5 percent which is paying 60 percent, they're going to see the system as fair. %$* 1
on the other hand, if you work for a billionaire who's paying a lower tax rate than you are, you're not going to see it as fair. %$* 1
and sufficiency. %$* 13
sufficiency really means, "are we raising enough revenues to put the government on a fiscal path that makes some sense? %$* 1
" and i think the pro motion side is going to point to the fact that it's really spending that's the problem. %$* 1
we're spending about 24 percent of gnp on federal expenditures. %$* 1
the norm in the last 20 years have been about 21 percent, and we've got to get spending under control. %$* 1
the other side is going to say, "wait a second. %$* 1
tax collections are only about 16 percent of gnp compared to 19 percent. %$* 1
we need to raise more money." and if we remember the words of willie sutton, "go where the money is." %$* 1
and efficiency was the last part of it you mentioned. %$* 13
well, efficiency is the idea of promoting economic growth. %$* 1
what kind of tax system would best stimulate the growth in the economy? %$* 1
and i think the pro the motion side is going to argue that it's very, very important to preserve the incentives that the "rich," quote, unquote, have to risk money to invest to create jobs for others. %$* 1
the against the motion side is probably going to point to the fact that a dollar in the hands of a middle class family is going to be spent, and in a direct way stimulate economic activity; whereas a dollar in the hands of a rich person might just sit there. %$* 1
all right, bob, thanks very much in that slicing the word “enough,” enough has a lot of meanings, and thank you for framing this for us. %$* 13
and let's welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
good. %$* 1
thank you, thank you. %$* 13
and may i invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for bringing this to us. %$* 13
if you ask, "do the rich pay their fair in taxes? %$* 13
" you really do have to ask a couple of other questions. %$* 13
you’ve got to ask, well, what do you mean by rich? %$* 13
how much, how much is rich? %$* 13
how much money does that take? %$* 13
and, what do we mean by "enough"? %$* 13
now, consider that to be counted in the top 1 percent of earners in america, you need to be making approximately $380,000 a year. %$* 13
consider, also, that that 1 percent pays more than a third, as of 2009, pays more than a third of all of the federal income tax that comes in to the federal government. %$* 13
is that too much? %$* 13
is that too little? %$* 13
well, let's make a debate of it. %$* 13
true or false, the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
another debate from intelligence squared u.s., i'm john donvan, we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for, and against, this motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
they go in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our debaters include, on the side arguing for the motion, glenn hubbard, dean of columbia business school and economic advisor to mitt romney. %$* 13
your partner it art laffer, he is best known for the laffer curve, one of the main theoretical constructs of supply side economics. %$* 13
on the side arguing against the motion, robert reich, he's a professor at uc berkeley and former secretary of labor in the clinton administration. %$* 13
and his partner, mark zandi, he's chief economist of moody's analytics. %$* 13
our motion is this: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters and welcome first, glenn hubbard. %$* 13
glenn, you are dean of the columbia business school, you are also-- %$* 13
throughout 2012, you've been advisor to mitt romney's campaign. %$* 13
recently you were profiled in the new york times, and you were described there as, "succinct, authoritative, and unabashedly partisan."i want to know, is that fair? %$* 13
are you unabashedly partisan? %$* 13
and could you be succinct and authoritative? %$* 13
well, i am always succinct. %$* 14
to the partisan, i guess i'm old enough to remember when bill bradley and i collaborated on an idea that's not too far dissimilar to tonight. %$* 14
and president obama's housing plans follow work by me and by a colleague at columbia. %$* 14
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is art laffer. %$* 14
ladies and gentlemen, art laffer. %$* 13
art, you were an economic adviser to president reagan; you served as chief economist at the office of management and budget. %$* 13
you're best known as the father of supply side economics because of the curve that is named after you. %$* 13
and i think it's fortuitous that your last name was not mcdougal or rabinowitz, or kowalski, because we would be talking about the kowalski curve. %$* 13
your name adds a certain light-heartedness to your curve-- %$* 13
and you are a lighthearted guy. %$* 13
in two sentences or less, what is the laffer curve about? %$* 13
well, number one, the laffer curve really is my profile. %$* 15
and the other famous thing about me is i am a little bit taller than robert reich. %$* 15
our motion is the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here to argue against the motion, robert reich. %$* 13
you're a professor of public policy at uc berkeley, former secretary of labor in the clinton administration. %$* 13
you are a bit of an intellectual brawler yourself, and you can dish it out. %$* 13
you've also had to take it. %$* 13
bill o'reilly recently called you "a communist who secretly adores karl marx." neil cavuto said you were a sanctimonious twit. %$* 13
question is, does this stuff really hurt your feelings? %$* 13
no, not at all-- %$* 16
no. %$* 16
actually, i don't know how bill reilly knew that i was a secret admirer of karl marx because it was a secret. %$* 16
and-- %$* 13
logic on that side of the aisle. %$* 16
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the incomparable mark zandi. %$* 16
ladies and gentlemen, mark zandi. %$* 13
mark is-- %$* 13
i'm nervous about this now. %$* 17
you're going to be nice, right? %$* 17
you're going to be nice? %$* 17
this is so easy. %$* 13
yeah, okay, all right. %$* 17
you are the chief economist of moody's analytics, and you have one of the most widely followed economic forecasts. %$* 13
that was nice. %$* 13
that was nice, yeah. %$* 17
that was very nice. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 17
i'll take that. %$* 17
i'm a great guy, too. %$* 17
here's the other part of it. %$* 13
when the bush cuts neared expiration in 2010, you at that time were in favor of their extension initially? %$* 13
yes, i was, yeah. %$* 17
now? %$* 13
i think the president's proposal is the appropriate proposal, allow the tax rates for upper income individuals to expire. %$* 17
so, you do get to change your mind? %$* 13
no, i am an eclectic economist in that i think the economics depend on the times, and the times now are such that we've got to address our fiscal problems. %$* 17
thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters for this evening. %$* 13
now, in this debate, you, our live audience, act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice, once before you've heard the arguments and once again after you've heard the arguments, and the team whose numbers have moved your votes the most from beginning to end will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's register the first vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypad that's at the right hand of your seat, our motion is this: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
if you agree with that motion as you come in off the street, push number 1.if you disagree, push number 2.if you're undecided, push number 3.all of the other keys, you can ignore. %$* 13
they're inoperable. %$* 13
and you can also correct yourself if you've pushed the wrong button. %$* 13
and, again, this is being-- %$* 13
these are wireless devices, so they're all being recorded backstage and tabulated. %$* 13
and then, at the end of the evening, it takes about as long as it takes me to finish this sentence, we'll have the results again quickly comparing the two votes. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
let's launch. %$* 13
our motion is the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
on to round 1, opening statements from each of our debaters and turn, and speaking first for the motion, the rich are taxed enough, glenn hubbard, who is dean of the columbia business school. %$* 13
he was chairman of the council of economic advisers under president george w. bush, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in the treasury department, ladies and gentlemen, glenn hubbard. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 14
thank-- %$* 14
i'd certainly like to thank intelligence squared and the richmond center for an event on topic this important. %$* 14
my partner, art laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start. %$* 14
but i just want to make two points this evening. %$* 14
first, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that americans have traditionally had. %$* 14
i'll come back to that point. %$* 14
second, if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich. %$* 14
now, let's start with how high tax rates are. %$* 14
if you look at survey data and ask americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid. %$* 14
if that's true, the current and projected marginal tax rates-- %$* 14
that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn-- %$* 14
are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income. %$* 14
and, if you're new yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, i'm leaving a lot on the table here. %$* 14
and 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there. %$* 14
and, on top of that, there's an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime. %$* 14
all of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond. %$* 14
now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns. %$* 14
first, if you step back, they treat the nation's income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's sliced. %$* 14
an economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make. %$* 14
those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes. %$* 14
the second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government. %$* 14
and here my observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it. %$* 14
the bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich. %$* 14
now, let's start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates. %$* 14
now, i can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it. %$* 14
and economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high. %$* 14
now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving. %$* 14
and, here, i just want to offer you a forecast, and i should be honest with you that president bush once said about me that "glenn can't even forecast the past." and i think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it's worth. %$* 14
but economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates. %$* 14
the responses of high income tax payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers. %$* 14
of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income. %$* 14
high business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs. %$* 14
more than half of americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates. %$* 14
raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment. %$* 14
if you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed bowles-simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates in bowles-simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent. %$* 14
and high tax rates don't necessarily produce revenue. %$* 14
the fact that revenue shares and gdp haven't varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times. %$* 14
the right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers. %$* 14
now, what about the larger government? %$* 14
before the financial crisis, federal spending in the u.s.averaged about 20 percent of gdp for many decades. %$* 14
what if we decide we'd like a bigger government? %$* 14
let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many european countries. %$* 14
shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government? %$* 14
well, the simple answer is no. %$* 14
or, more accurately, it can't. %$* 14
if you look across the oecd, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may surprise some of you. %$* 14
the u.s. has the most progressive tax system. %$* 14
and, in fact, the u.s.tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country's tax system. %$* 14
so you think to yourself, "well, how can this be? %$* 14
we're thinking of european nations with large government and social welfare programs." but the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a vat that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending. %$* 14
so the real choice is the size of government. %$* 14
that's the debate we need to have first. %$* 14
taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards. %$* 14
the right tax system for this country can accomplish both. %$* 14
and so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals. %$* 14
if we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay. %$* 14
the rich are not a plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch. %$* 14
for the proposition, the rich are taxed enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes. %$* 14
thank you, glenn hubbard. %$* 13
our motion is the rich are taxed enough, and now here to speak against the motion, i'd like to introduce robert reich, he is the chancellor's professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley, and the former secretary of labor in the clinton administration. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, robert reich. %$* 13
as you can see, the economy has worn me down. %$* 16
but we're in a recovery. %$* 16
look. %$* 16
i think this is an absurd motion, and i urge you to vote against it when you have a chance to vote against it again. %$* 16
it's an absurd motion for the following reasons. %$* 16
number one, we have a huge budget deficit. %$* 16
even if we didn't want to expand the size of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a gigantic budget deficit. %$* 16
and the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross domestic product. %$* 16
and the question is how do you get the deficit down? %$* 16
how do you get the debt down? %$* 16
well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. %$* 16
the simpson-bowles commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "well, we have one dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts."but there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax increases. %$* 16
is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are in the middle, or is it people who are poor? %$* 16
and i want to tell you in terms of common sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top. %$* 16
why, why, why? %$* 16
you can applaud, but don't take away from my time. %$* 16
why? %$* 16
because number one, people at the top have never had it so good. %$* 16
i mean, the percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one percent, has doubled over the past 30 years. %$* 16
it used to be 10 percent back in 1980.it's now over 20 percent. %$* 16
that is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 percent of total income. %$* 16
if you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years. %$* 16
if you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total income over the last 30 years. %$* 16
the richest 400 americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. %$* 16
and this kind of asymmetry, this kind of distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really something new in this country, at least within people's living memory. %$* 16
it wasn't this way in the '50s or '60s or '70s. %$* 16
it wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s. %$* 16
so, if we're going to have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the top. %$* 16
now, glenn hubbard is talking about, "well, you have a negative effect, a negative incentive effect." come on. %$* 16
in the immortal words of joe biden, "malarkey! %$* 16
" mean, look. %$* 16
the tax rate-- %$* 16
the marginal tax rate on top incomes-- %$* 16
go back before 1981-- %$* 16
for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at least 70 percent. %$* 16
under dwight d. eisenhower, president dwight d. eisenhower, republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist-- %$* 16
bill o'reilly would not have called him a communist-- %$* 16
and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes under eisenhower was 91 percent. %$* 16
if you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, it's still-- %$* 16
the effective tax rate under eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher than anybody today is talking about. %$* 16
we're talking-- %$* 16
right now, we're talking about the difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to bill clinton's days? %$* 16
i mean, this is a ridiculous debate. %$* 16
it should not even be debated obviously. %$* 16
given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this question. %$* 16
i mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic growth. %$* 16
well, guess what? %$* 16
in the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981.there was no negative impact on growth. %$* 16
i mean, george w. bush reduces-- %$* 16
remember 1981-- %$* 16
2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, "oh, we're going to get this huge increase in growth, and we're going to get all kinds of jobs," using and spouting supply-side-- %$* 16
excuse me, art-- %$* 16
nonsense-- %$* 16
and what did we get? %$* 16
we actually had less growth. %$* 16
we had fewer jobs, even before the great crash. %$* 16
we had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under the president i was very proud to have served under, that is bill clinton, who raised taxes. %$* 16
we had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were created. %$* 16
that wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth. %$* 16
we raised taxes, 22 million new jobs were created. %$* 16
i was secretary of labor during those times. %$* 16
i created every single one of those jobs. %$* 16
thank you. %$* 16
thank you very much. %$* 16
so just to-- %$* 16
in summary-- %$* 16
we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government. %$* 16
number two, the rich have done extraordinarily well. %$* 16
everybody else hasn't. %$* 16
in fact, median family incomes since 2000 have actually dropped 8 percent. %$* 16
you want to put more taxes on average working people? %$* 16
no. %$* 16
that's simply not fair. %$* 16
it's not going to work. %$* 16
number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era. %$* 16
of course you have to raise taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country. %$* 16
so please vote against this silly proposition. %$* 16
thank you. %$* 16
thank you, robert reich. %$* 13
and i remind you of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
my name is john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two who are arguing it out over this motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
you have heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce and bring to the lectern art laffer. %$* 13
he is the founder and chairman of laffer associates and laffer investments. %$* 13
he is known as the father of supply side economics, was a former advisor to president ronald reagan. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, art laffer. %$* 13
if i can just start with this hotel you guys got for us today, i had the craziest thing happen. %$* 15
i came in a little early. %$* 15
and i went down to the health club. %$* 15
and now, i'm not an exercise freak or anything. %$* 15
but i was down there. %$* 15
and this absolutely gorgeous woman walked in. %$* 15
she's just beautiful. %$* 15
and the manager of the health club was standing right next to me, so i said, "excuse me, by any chance do you have a machine that would attract someone like that to someone like me? %$* 15
" and the guy says, "yes, i do." and he took me over to the citicorp atm. and i just want to say that the rich are not the citicorp atm. if you look at this world, and i-- %$* 15
but, robert, you're a favorite of mine, and you have been for years; and, glenn, you did a great job on this; and mark, i'm anticipating your comments and-- %$* 15
but look at it, you got-- %$* 15
there would be three reasons you could possibly want to raise tax rates on the rich. %$* 15
you're jealous of them, and robert may be but he's one of them. %$* 15
and the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue. %$* 15
and you're going to create prosperity. %$* 15
those are the other two. %$* 15
and i'm going to land on the last two and look at the facts if i can. %$* 15
i mean, in the 30-- %$* 15
if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the roaring '20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the roaring '20s. %$* 15
it was called the "roaring ‘20s" for a reason. %$* 15
we had enormous expansion of growth, output, and employment. %$* 15
the top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 1 percent of income earners. %$* 15
the irs really likes to know how much you owe them. %$* 15
and we have great data. %$* 15
the top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of gdp soared during the period of the roaring '20s. %$* 15
if you look at the 1930s, we raised the highest margin-- %$* 15
well, we first had may of 1930 we had the smoot- hawley tariff. %$* 15
then hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent. %$* 15
then roosevelt on january 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. %$* 15
there's a reason why it was called the great depression. %$* 15
the economy was in a shambles in large part because of the tax increases. %$* 15
the revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners as a share of gdp went down during this period. %$* 15
you look at the kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. %$* 15
we also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate rates, did tariff reform as well-- %$* 15
the kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate-- %$* 15
it was called the-- %$* 15
it was called the "go-go '60s," if you remember, a boom in the economy, and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period as a share of gdp.we then had the four stooges, johnson, nixon, ford, and carter. %$* 15
which i consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put on planet earth. %$* 15
if you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years. %$* 15
the stock market collapsed during that period. %$* 15
tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners went down as a share of gdp. then we had-- %$* 15
then we had ronny-- %$* 15
oh, excuse me, the sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of everything we could find. %$* 15
we had steiger-hansen in '78, then we cut the-- %$* 15
i mean, under reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent. %$* 15
if you look at the whole period from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 percent to 35 percent. %$* 15
we cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 percent to 15 percent. %$* 15
we cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board. %$* 15
we had a boom, and it wasn't just ronald reagan. %$* 15
robert, your president, by the way, cut the capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group between 65 and 72. he also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as a share of gdp by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the greatest secretary of labor of all time-- %$* 15
but he was a big taxer. %$* 15
we had huge growth during that period. %$* 15
if you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners-- %$* 15
you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of gdp from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of gdp. by 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of gdp, it more than doubled. %$* 15
let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys. %$* 15
you're not. %$* 15
they can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators-- %$* 15
they can hire-- %$* 15
when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don't for a moment think it's a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it's like being poor. %$* 15
they're in there for some reason and they find it. %$* 15
you know, what you really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff. %$* 15
and get them out of the business of trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic growth. %$* 15
and that is the way you got to go. %$* 15
we all want increased tax rates on the rich, but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it by lowering rates and broadening the base. %$* 15
and if i can correct one other little mistake, robert, just a little one. %$* 15
simpson-bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does rivlin-domenici. %$* 15
they lower rates, they broaden the base. %$* 15
in '86, we cut tax rates on the rich dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent. %$* 15
in the senate, 97 votes for that, three against it, including joe biden. %$* 15
what was his malarkey comment? %$* 15
excuse me, maybe he was looking in the mirror. %$* 15
but you also had bill bradley, you also had howard metzenbaum, you had all of these-- %$* 15
and you had chris dodd and you had teddy kennedy. %$* 15
everyone knows that you don't create growth by raising tax rates on the rich. %$* 15
you can't love jobs and hate job creators. %$* 15
and you can't tax an economy into prosperity, it ain't going to happen. %$* 15
thank you very much. %$* 15
thank you, art laffer. %$* 13
thank you, art laffer. %$* 13
our motion is the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and here is our final speaker, making his opening statement, mark zandi. %$* 13
mark is the chief economist of moody's analytics and is one of the most frequently cited economists in washington; he's also the author of this book, "paying the price, ending the great recession, and beginning a new american century." ladies and gentlemen, mark zandi. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
thank you, john. %$* 17
thanks, intelligence squared and bob rosenkranz for the opportunity. %$* 17
i did notice that on amazon the price of my book is falling; demand, supply, you know. %$* 17
we need a little more demand here to help me out. %$* 17
let me begin by saying that, you know, it's obvious the american economy has very serious challenges. %$* 17
but i would put two right at the top of the list. %$* 17
the first, this is in no particular order of importance, but the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the second is our fiscal problems. %$* 17
the statistics here are pretty startling. %$* 17
let's begin with the income distribution, wealth distribution. %$* 17
if you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income. %$* 17
they consume 60 percent of the total pie. %$* 17
so, from cars to clothing and everything in between, they consume 60 percent. %$* 17
and they own 90 percent of the wealth. %$* 17
these are pretty skewed statistics. %$* 17
and the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed over the past 30 years. %$* 17
you know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these statistics were very different. %$* 17
i'll just give you one example. %$* 17
i mentioned that the top 20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending. %$* 17
if you go back to 1980, it was closer to 45 percent. %$* 17
so, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed. %$* 17
our fiscal problems are obviously very significant as well. %$* 17
if you go back to the year 2000-- %$* 17
we'll give bob credit for the 22 million jobs. %$* 17
should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too? %$* 17
okay, bob. %$* 17
let's clap for that. %$* 17
there was a surplus, 2000.we've been running deficits ever since. %$* 17
the last fiscal year just ended. %$* 17
we had a deficit of $1.1 trillion. %$* 17
you can ask, "well, what's going on? %$* 17
" lots of things. %$* 17
there's the wars. %$* 17
that's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years. %$* 17
that's afghanistan and iraq. %$* 17
there's the bush era tax cuts. %$* 17
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period. %$* 17
and, of course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years. %$* 17
you add it up, it's a lot of money. %$* 17
so, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle. %$* 17
now, the bad news is that-- %$* 17
it sounds pretty bad-- %$* 17
the bad news is that if we-- %$* 17
these trends will continue if policymakers don't act. %$* 17
if they don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very self-reinforcing in a negative way. %$* 17
take the deficits. %$* 17
if policymakers continue on with current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-gdp ratio is going to go from the current 70 percent-- %$* 17
and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 35 to 70 percent-- %$* 17
it'll go over 100 percent by 2025.now, all good research would show that we got a problem if that happens. %$* 17
the world's not going to work for us. %$* 17
at some point, investors are going to balk. %$* 17
interest rates are going to rise. %$* 17
it's going to affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards. %$* 17
that has to change. %$* 17
and the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to - - are firmly in place, and they're not going to change. %$* 17
there's many. %$* 17
globalization-- %$* 17
a great recent piece in the new york times, going over this, globalization, technological change-- %$* 17
these are all really very good things for our economy. %$* 17
we need to continue on with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth. %$* 17
i'm a person with no skills and talent, i'm getting creamed by trade. %$* 17
i'm competing against low-wage workers in china and india. %$* 17
i can't compete. %$* 17
i'm just getting crushed. %$* 17
and, of course, high income households are benefitting enormously, right? %$* 17
i mean, glenn, art, bob go off to china, they go off to india, they go off to the uk to give a speech, they get paid very well. %$* 17
unfortunately, i'm not in their class, you know? %$* 17
i don't get paid as well. %$* 17
but, it's globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth rises. %$* 17
and i think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, "enough! %$* 17
" and they're going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher income households. %$* 17
now, here's the good news. %$* 17
we can solve this problem, and we can solve it together in a combined way. %$* 17
we have to think about addressing our fiscal problems through the prism of the income-- %$* 17
the distribution of income and wealth. %$* 17
so, we need to cut government spending? %$* 17
absolutely. %$* 17
we have to do this. %$* 17
but, we have to do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs. %$* 17
you know, take-- %$* 17
change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance policies, but that only goes so far. %$* 17
we don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare program and we lose support for things like medicare and social security. %$* 17
that'd only take us so far. %$* 17
so we have to address taxes. %$* 17
if i were king for the day, i wouldn't raise tax rates on anybody, and i don't think we need to, right? %$* 17
i am all for tax reform. %$* 17
let's close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden the base, i'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right? %$* 17
i mean, that is the best way, that is the way proposed by simpson-bowles, that's the way proposed by domenici-rivlin, and that is a bipartisan way. %$* 17
so this is not hard. %$* 17
it's-- %$* 17
we can do it, and that's the good news. %$* 17
now, let me end this way with a personal note. %$* 17
i started my own company back 25 years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother. %$* 17
and i wasn't in the proverbial garage but i was pretty close. %$* 17
it grew into a pretty good size-- %$* 17
a small business. %$* 17
i had 100 employees when i sold it to the moody's corporation. %$* 17
and the reason i'm telling you this is because i wanted to let you know that i'm not just an egghead. %$* 17
you know, i look like one maybe, but i'm not. %$* 17
so i look at these things through the-- %$* 17
in terms of data, theory, and experience. %$* 17
and my experience says, "you need to vote against this proposition." thank you. %$* 17
thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where the debaters are arguing it out over this motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
now we move on to round 2.and round 2 is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing it out. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, glenn hubbard and arthur laffer, are basically saying that taxing the rich is something that is absolutely going to backfire, that taxes have consequences on behavior, and that the wealthy, who would be the provider of jobs by being the builders of factories would be discouraged from doing so. %$* 13
and that as a result of that, not only would they be able to dodge their taxes as art laffer pointed out by hiring lawyers and he also said hiring senators-- %$* 13
but they will also not be giving jobs to people who would help broaden the tax base. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, robert reich and mark zandi, are saying, "it's absolutely common sense when you have to close a budget gap to go where the money is, that you go to tax the rich because they have an-- %$* 13
disproportionate amount of the wealth in the country to a degree that they never have before, and that the argument that taxing the wealthy will lead to depressions and recessions has not been borne out over certain periods of time. %$* 13
and we know that both sides to some degree are wandering through forests of data, and each are finding their own path possibly through the same forest-- %$* 13
picking out different periods of time to prove their points, but i want to go to-- %$* 13
before we get to-- %$* 13
but that's what economists do, john. %$* 18
well, yeah, and it's very exciting, i have to-- %$* 13
before we get to the parsing of the data, i want to get to something of an overall theme. %$* 13
we've been talking about the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
and "enough" has a couple of connotations, and one is "enough" to actually bring in revenues to pay for the government. %$* 13
the other is "enough" to be fair, to meet some sense of fairness. %$* 13
and i want to bring to the side that's arguing for the motion that the rich are taxed enough, the question of fairness. %$* 13
is the system, as it is now, at tax rates that exist now, in a system that-- %$* 13
the one that we have, is it fair? %$* 13
art laffer. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 15
no, it's not. %$* 15
it's totally not. %$* 15
and let me use an example if i may, warren buffett. %$* 15
he was sitting there asking my friends and i need to have higher tax rates, and i looked at his letter to the new york times, and he said he paid a little less than 7 million in taxes, and he said his tax rate was 17.4 percent, which i did the math, hold back, i'm a wiz, but i divided it. %$* 15
he had adjusted gross income of $40 million in that year. %$* 15
i then went to forbes. %$* 15
his wealth increased from 40 billion to 50 billion. %$* 15
i went to the bill and melinda gates foundation, and what you found there is he gave 1.75 billion to the bill and melinda gates foundation, not counting his sons’ foundations or his daughter's foundation. %$* 15
now, as a definition of "income," to me income is what you spend, what you give away, and your increase in your wealth. %$* 15
it s called the simon definition of income. %$* 15
if you look at bill gates-- %$* 15
i mean-- %$* 15
if you look at warren buffett, his income that year was $12 billion, and he paid 7 million in taxes. %$* 15

that, that’s the best man. %$* 7
i find, i mean, one of the things here are like the guy who’s pulled over on the highway by the, by the policeman saying, but, but officer, why are you stopping me, there are all kinds of people going faster than i was? %$* 3
but to, to deal with the, the young people, i mean, you're familiar with, with the state imposed doping programs in east germany and some of those, and the medical data arising from that. %$* 3
clearly there are health impacts, adverse health impacts on the athletes— %$* 3
yeah, those were horrible, and that was close to coercion, and, as i said, the side effects in kids are sufficient to have very rigorous penalties against those who do that sort of thing. %$* 2
julian, your question. %$* 0
ok, so on the topic of children, it’s a major plank in your argument. %$* 6
dale murphy said it would send the wrong message to children, and, and dick pound said, uh, you didn't want your the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” children or anyone else’s children becoming chemical stockpiles. %$* 6
so, the argument, as i understand it here, is we need to ban performance enhancing drugs in adults to protect our children. %$* 6
so, my question to dick pound is, don’t we have, already in society, different rules and laws for children and adults, so on your argument, um, we should ban everyone from driving motorcars, because some children may illegally drive them and kill themselves. %$* 6
so, my question to you is, do you think we also should ban driving cars in adults because it might be abused by some children? %$* 6
well, or using alcohol. %$* 8
isn't, isn't that a silly question? %$* 3
that, that’s the, why, why do we accept the rules— %$* 6
let’s say, let’s say alcohol then. %$* 4
alcohol then. %$* 6
should we ban alcohol for adults because kids are going to drink it? %$* 4
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” no, no, no. %$* 3
i mean, the issue, the issue %$* 3
what’s the difference? %$* 4
because the community at large, sport is not going to solve every problem on the face of the planet, even though we come to affairs like this and like to pretend it can. %$* 3
uh, but the community, governments, national olympic committee, sports federations, the public at large say, here are things that you should not take, and there’s a reason for them. %$* 3
they're, they're either, they're performance enhancing, they’re risk to health, or they're contrary to a defined term, not a pornographic definition, uh, called spirit of sport. %$* 3
and you, you examine every, um, substance or method against that matrix, and if it meets two of the three criteria, then chances are it may be on the list. %$* 3
there’s a good reason for it. %$* 3
it may be wrong. %$* 3
maybe somebody’s got the science wrong. %$* 3
maybe they do. %$* 3
nobody’s perfect. %$* 3
and science goes on. %$* 3
but, in the meantime, that’s the community, and that’s the values that, that are reflected in, in the community. %$* 3
all right, we are running behind on time, and i will take some of the blame for that. %$* 0
george michael, last question, and then we’ll the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” open it up to the audience, and we’ll try and pick up the pace. %$* 0
george? %$* 0
i’ll just make it real quick. %$* 7
doctor, you said that only six percent of the tests came back positive? %$* 7
in that year, that first year of universal testing. %$* 2
let me just say this. %$* 7
bob, you’ve got to back me up, i only have one statement. %$* 7
yeah? %$* 0
it was the single worst drug testing in the history of sports period. %$* 7
don’t ever refer to that six percent— %$* 7
if you, if you failed, if you failed that test— %$* 0
that was a disgrace, an american disgrace. %$* 7
then you failed an i.q.test simultaneously. %$* 0
no— %$* 0
i have a strong opinion. %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” no one thinks, no one thinks that— %$* 0
thank you. %$* 7
that an announced test that didn't, that didn't test for all, a whole array of designer steroids, and still showed somehow six or seven percent failing, no one thinks that’s the limit of it. %$* 0
in fact, you could reasonably %$* 0
many multiples beyond that— %$* 0
it’s worse than that. %$* 3
and i think everyone who knows the dynamics of baseball at that time— %$* 0
we’re going to test— %$* 7
it’s worse than, it’s worse than that— %$* 3
we’re going to test next tuesday, go ahead and drink all the orange juice you want between now and then. %$* 7
if you tested positive on that, on that series of tests, you could the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” come back two weeks later, and if you were then cleaned out, they, they took away the first test. %$* 3
that, that was a sham. %$* 0
sham? %$* 8
let, let us open it, let us open it now, uh, to questions from the audience, uh, please, unlike some of us, get to the point quickly %$* 0
and, uh, wait until you get to the microphone to pose your question and if you’re a member of the press, identify yourself as such. %$* 0
yes, sir. %$* 0
i’m not a member of the press and i—but i would like to thank all of the panelists for your comments. %$* 9
um, i’d welcome comment from any and all panelists, as to the legitimacy if any, of our congress imposing its will on this issue and holding these hearings. %$* 9
what is its technical legitimacy in doing that, and philosophically do you think it’s any of their business or not— %$* 9
all right, we’ll let one person from each side respond to that, is it any of congress’s business to be involved as they have been, radley? %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” you—you can probably guess my answer, um %$* 4
uh, just a very, very quick anecdote, when baseball first objected to the, the, uh, congress’s jurisdiction to look into this matter, uh, congressman davis and congressman waxman sent a letter back to baseball, stating that cong—their, their particular committee, the government reform committee, had jurisdiction over any matter at any time. %$* 4
uh, this is the, the sort of arrogance of congress, they think that there’s nothing that they don’t have authority, uh, and jurisdiction over. %$* 4
um, i, i %$* 4
people are gonna say that, uh, the baseball anti-trust exemption, uh, somehow means that they, they have to sort of bend to the will of congress. %$* 4
uh, i would submit that if, if that’s your argument, then, everybody who gets a government benefit, uh, sort of throws, uh, all of their rights out the window from student loan recipients to, uh, public housing recipients to, you know, corporate subsidies, so— uh, i, yeah, i, i don’t think this is an issue of congress, i think baseball can determine what its rules ought to be, uh, on its own. %$* 4
on the other hand, uh, even though there may have been plenty of grandstanding involved, you can’t deny that there was movement after congress first, uh, convened hearings in 2005. it was, it was a perfect storm, there was canseco’s book, balco was breaking, and the congressional hearings were part of it, but the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” it seemed to move the issue along. %$* 0
oh, absolutely it did, and we—whether, whether or not that’s a good thing or bad thing that individual congressmen can force an entire industry to sort of bend to their will, uh, i, i, i happen to find that troubling. %$* 4
and i, i have to say there’s something fishy going on, when the congress holds hearings and the president takes time in a state of the union address told about the horrors of steroids, which as far as i know haven’t killed any kids yet this year or not very many— %$* 2
yes. %$* 5
and, and smok—and smoking, george, will kills 400,000 people every year, 400,000, 90 percent of whom start smoking in childhood, but this is not worthy of congressional hearings or 30 seconds of the state of the union address— %$* 2
well, the—the nation lacks an effective steroid lobby %$* 0
unlike the tobacco lobby— %$* 0
there’s something going on here other than deep concer— %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” they don’t have an effective steroid lobby. %$* 0
there’s something going on other than deep concern for the well- being of children. %$* 2
congress’s involvement. %$* 0
dale maybe, what do you think? %$* 0
well, i, uh %$* 5
i think, uh, it’s been helpful, i think though what we will find is that the mitchell report will—something that was done internally, will be of most help, uh, to this problem. %$* 5
um, i think it’ll be a catalyst for us to make some progress. %$* 5
but i, i gotta say, if the argument is smoking or alcohol or prohibition or lasik surgery, that’s not what it says up there. %$* 5
it says should we allow performance-enhancing drugs, i still don’t see the correlation between bringing in the problems with alcohol which are real, i would love to next year to come back and discuss whether baseball should, uh, get rid of all their beer sponsors. %$* 5
i would be in favor of that, but that’s not the question tonight. %$* 5
there, there—it is a relatively small problem, totally agree with that. %$* 5
but that’s just not the question tonight. %$* 5
next question from the audience. %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 0
i always thought that competitive sports meant a natural competition, a motivation, an incentive, a desire to want to be the very best. %$* 10
that’s what we always teach our kids no matter what it is that we do—what they wanna do in life. %$* 10
and it seems to me, that by taking any kind of a performance-enhancing anything, you are taking away the naturalness of wanting to achieve. %$* 10
of wanting to be the best, of wanting to grow. %$* 10
it says just pump me up, and you have a good business thing here, and put me out. %$* 10
to whom specifically is your question or statement directed— %$* 0
it’s not really a question, it’s just a confusion— %$* 10
right. %$* 2
there have to %$* 2
as to—it’s a confusion as to why— it’s not a matter of death, it’s a matter of life, why would drugs even be permissible under any level. %$* 10
dr. %$* 0
fost, a brief response— %$* 0
like carnac i can answer the question without even knowing the question. %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” place—place an envelope to your forehead when doing so in that case. %$* 0
um, that’s a nice notion about sports and it’s certainly what we ought to promote for our kids but it hasn’t been what sports has been about at an elite level for 7,000 years and that’s why i mentioned the babylonians, if you took the steroids and the growth hormone away, what you would have is literally a thousand other things that athletes do to enhance their performance, none of them natural. %$* 2
uh, athletes drink gatorade from a factory, they take pasta to carbo-load that’s made from a factory. %$* 2
uh, they don’t eat potatoes out of the ground to carbo- load, they put on fancy shoes, they train at altitude, they do everything— %$* 2
can i interrupt, doctor— %$* 3
—there a—there’s no athlete since the beginning of time, who competed naturally to win a race. %$* 2
doctor, i gotta interrupt. %$* 3
you’re comparing drinking gatorade to taking anabolic steroids? %$* 3
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” no, i’m not, i’m just saying that— %$* 2
what are you—well then why bring it up, it, it’s— %$* 3
it’s really what she bring—she said, it should be just about nature, just, people on—by their own natural ability, i don’t know a single athlete who relies on his or her own natural ability to compete. %$* 2
do—do you think a hypoxic air tent is natural? %$* 6
is that a—is that a—a hypoxic air tent. %$* 6
this is what all us athletes use to, to boost their— %$* 6
well, my understanding is the reason they do it is to level the playing field with those that live at high altitude, which, this training is readily accessible and, and permissible. %$* 3
but not— %$* 2
performance-enhancing drugs are not permissible. %$* 3
to the audience— the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 0
so— %$* 3
to the audience, yes. %$* 0
yes, ma’am. %$* 0
i’m sara schorno with the huffington post. %$* 11
and this question is more for those against the notion, um, maybe particularly mr. %$* 11
pound. %$* 11
setting the legalities aside and the fact that it’s against the rules, um, what difference do you see if any between an athlete using performance enhancers to stay in the game and say an actress using injections and cosmetic surgery to stay in the movies? %$* 11
be—because what we’ve agreed %$* 3
in sport— %$* 3
but setting the rules aside is what i’m saying, i mean you mentioned a lot of ethics, and you mentioned a lot of unfair advantages. %$* 11
so using those two examples that you’ve used, what do you see the difference is. %$* 11
well, you, you have to have rules in order to have sport. %$* 3
you, you can’t have sport without rules, it’s not, uh, it’s not, you know, the only, the world’s shortest rulebook i know is australian-rules football. %$* 3
you know. %$* 3
“get ball to end,” and, and, uh— the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” so i, i don’t think you can compare that. %$* 3
we’re talking about sport. %$* 3
what, what— %$* 3
no, no, i understand— %$* 11
actresses do— %$* 3
—i understand sport, but, one of the arguments that you’ve used is the ethics of it. %$* 11
um, that it’s against the rules because it’s unethical and because it’s unfair— %$* 11
no, no, no, that’s, it’s backwards. %$* 3
it’s unethical because you have agreed to the performance of a, a particular skill in a particular way, and you’ve broken that promise. %$* 3
you’ve cheated on your fellow competitor, that’s what’s unethical. %$* 3
so then do you think that if it were to be accepted in sports that it would then still be unethical, or if they did allow steroids within sports would it then be ethical to use them. %$* 11
it would not be unethical to use them. %$* 3
that’s right. %$* 3
no, no, it’s, it’s the rule. %$* 3
couple more quick questions. %$* 0
limit—we know—now all the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” hands are going up, but we don’t have time for everybody so, whom have the fine folks out there decided—yes. %$* 0
uh, jon frankel, hbo’s “real sports.” um, first thing is your, your statistic of 90 percent permanent disability in the nfl is way off and i’ve done pieces criticizing the nfl so it’s not fair to invoke that specific— %$* 12
what—what is the right number. %$* 2
well, there’s—there is no real number, there’s, there’s no way to know what permanent disability is and that’s been one of the long-running arguments— %$* 12
how are you defining permanent disability, dr. %$* 0
fost. %$* 0
i was just quoting a new york times study of, uh, people who had—weren’t able to perform activities of daily living, um, i think was the definition, but i don’t remember precisely. %$* 2
jon— %$* 0
but if you have a different number i’d like to know what it is. %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” well, what i really would like to get at is you, you are talking about the fact that there are no, or minimal side effects when it comes to steroids and you’re comparing adults versus youth. %$* 12
um, i haven’t turned on a television and seen a commercial for, um, some sort of medicine that doesn’t spend half its time telling us about the side effects, so i’m—i dare find it hard to believe that steroids don’t have some side effects that don’t have serious health implications. %$* 12
um, you all on this side of the panel for the motion, seem to suggest that, any advantage, whether it’s drinking caffeine or such is a good advantage, so it is worth doing. %$* 12
so, i wonder whether you advocate insider trading, um %$* 12
uh, in that, in that way, because it clearly gives us an advantage. %$* 12
my other point is to the kids, and it’s been brought up by the side against the motion and that is, why should my son, who at eight years old, who already watches barry bonds, when he gets to the high school level, and there’s a kid who plays second base, who’s—he knows is taking something, and all he wants to do is play second base on his high school baseball team, he may not even wanna make it to college or to the pros. %$* 12
he just wants to play at the high school level. %$* 12
inevitably he’s gonna be faced with that decision of, should i take, or should i not. %$* 12
all right. %$* 0
are all advantages positive advantages, and what about the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” the scenario that jon frankel just laid out, who wants to respond, radley— %$* 0
i’ll take the first part if, if you wanna take the second, um, i— look, i don’t know what advantages are harmful and what advantages are helpful, i mean my, my position on this is that, part of the problem is, is what we don’t know, uh, because everything is, is, is black market and is, and it is under this veil. %$* 4
uh, i think my point is that we need to lift that veil and, and trust adults to make their own decisions about what risks they’re going to take. %$* 4
norm? %$* 0
i think your son, uh, should, we should do everything we can to stop him from smoking, from drinking, from using steroids, and other things that are harmful and that he is not in a position to make informed choices, so i’m in favor of whatever we can reasonably do, to prohibit it, make it illegal, make it criminal, to test, to use kids as indicators for these activities when they’re occurring, so i’m completely sympathetic to your concern, and i think we should do everything we can to stop it. %$* 2
we apologize to all those audience members who had good the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” questions of their own but because of time we have to move on to the summation portion but before we do that let me pose a question to this side of the table. %$* 0
it’s often tossed out, well, people use various medications for this reason or that, or, uh, the woman from the huffington post used the example of an actress who might resort to plastic surgery as she ages, other performance enhancers of various kinds. %$* 0
but isn’t that a specious argument because, there is no objective competition for who has the fewest wrinkles. %$* 0
and if, and i don’t mean to be flippant, but if there were some kind of competition, that people cared about, and that people entered into in good faith, and that had an ongoing history that people cared about, and that competition entailed how frequently and with what level of, uh, of effectiveness one could perform sexually, then perhaps you might, you might have to put in rules against the use of viagra, one com—competitor to another. %$* 0
but that doesn’t apply, that doesn’t apply to the use, or the suggested use of viagra, it doesn’t apply to the suggested use of plastic surgery. %$* 0
in competitive sports, which are, which are conducted with a structure and with objective rules and goals, it seems to me that whatever anyone uses for performance enhancement of one kind or another, outside those spheres, isn’t analogous. %$* 0
response? %$* 0
no, i agree, i mean we’re—but, but we keep going back to the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” rules here and, none of us is advocating breaking the rules, uh, i mean the purpose of this debate tonight is to deter—we’re debating what those rules ought to be. %$* 4
uh, i’m not saying that once you enter into an agreement with a league that says you will not use these—this list of substances, i’m not defending people who then go and use those substances, i mean that—that’s fraud basically. %$* 4
um, what we’re debating here is what those rules ought to be— %$* 4
but you would agree that what is used outside competitive sports and taken for granted in society, really is not a persuasive argument for what should be allowed within competitive sports. %$* 0
you have to make a different argument and maybe there’s a good one but that isn’t it. %$* 0
uh, i think it’s a different argument to say that because we use liposuction or, or get, uh, botox injections, that that’s the same as, uh, uh, entering into an agreement, uh, to, to, to have a competition, uh, under, under set guidelines— %$* 4
yeah, if there were a flat-abs competition and one guy had to do sit-ups and someone else got liposuction, it wouldn’t be a fair competition, if anyone cared about that competition. %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” absolutely, if it—if you’re having a beauty contest and the, and the judge—and the, the criteria is natural beauty and someone went out and got breast implants, uh, and won the competition— %$* 4
right. %$* 0
—i, i, i would object to that, yes. %$* 4
all right, it is time now %$* 0
on that uplifting note, uh, for our, for our summation. %$* 0
and, and here is the order of debater presentation, it begins with dick pound. %$* 0
two minutes. %$* 0
thank you, i think that, that out of the mouths of the other side you’ve heard, um, all kinds of reasons why this, uh %$* 3
motion should be voted on in our, uh, direction. %$* 3
human nature is not gonna change. %$* 3
um, the—we’ve heard from a number of the, uh, other, uh, the other opponents talking about, there would be ongoing development of these things, without care for safety. %$* 3
in, in the cat-and-mouse game of trying to improve what’s out there, there would be no care for safety, so that if you have a doctor prescribing 10 cc’s of %$* 3
anabolic steroid, uh, and everybody’s doing that, then there’s no more advantage. %$* 3
so the person who wants the advantage is gonna use 20, or 30, or 40.and that will the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” be pursued, uh, as will the, the sort of, uh, research in that area— we had kelly white, uh, american sprinter, come to the world anti-doping agency after she got caught in the balco situation. %$* 3
they were giving her the clear thg.she said she was having two enormous menstrual cycles every month, and she had blood pressure that was going right to the roof, and she went to conte and the others and said, uh, this is happening, he said oh, huh. %$* 3
well, maybe you should take a little less and, and, oh, and drink some more water. %$* 3
they had no idea %$* 3
the stuff was going from a laboratory bench into her system. %$* 3
and, and the system of other athletes. %$* 3
uh, excellence within sport is what everyone searches for, but it’s excellence within agreed rules. %$* 3
and, and the community speaks. %$* 3
that, that— %$* 3
30 seconds, dick. %$* 0
30? %$* 3
30. %$* 0
the community has spoken, i think the community has a legitimate interest in things that may be a health interest. %$* 3
you know, what happens in the major league influences triple-a, double-a, single-a, high school ball. %$* 3
there are pyramids in the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” hockey and basketball. %$* 3
this is a public-health problem. %$* 3
and finally i thought, um, one point made by, by dr. %$* 3
fost was, was quite telling. %$* 3
he said, more or less, that alcohol—in response to this gentleman’s question, alcohol, tobacco, steroids, and other dangerous things should be discouraged. %$* 3
and i agree with him entirely. %$* 3
30? %$* 3
thank you, i think that, that out of the mouths of the other side you’ve heard, um, all kinds of reasons why this, uh %$* 3
motion should be voted on in our, uh, direction. %$* 3
human nature is not gonna change. %$* 3
um, the—we’ve heard from a number of the, uh, other, uh, the other opponents talking about, there would be ongoing development of these things, without care for safety. %$* 3
in, in the cat-and-mouse game of trying to improve what’s out there, there would be no care for safety, so that if you have a doctor prescribing 10 cc’s of %$* 3
anabolic steroid, uh, and everybody’s doing that, then there’s no more advantage. %$* 3
so the person who wants the advantage is gonna use 20, or 30, or 40.and that will the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” be pursued, uh, as will the, the sort of, uh, research in that area— we had kelly white, uh, american sprinter, come to the world anti-doping agency after she got caught in the balco situation. %$* 3
they were giving her the clear thg.she said she was having two enormous menstrual cycles every month, and she had blood pressure that was going right to the roof, and she went to conte and the others and said, uh, this is happening, he said oh, huh. %$* 3
well, maybe you should take a little less and, and, oh, and drink some more water. %$* 3
they had no idea %$* 3
the stuff was going from a laboratory bench into her system. %$* 3
and, and the system of other athletes. %$* 3
uh, excellence within sport is what everyone searches for, but it’s excellence within agreed rules. %$* 3
and, and the community speaks. %$* 3
that, that— %$* 3
now his summation for the motion, norm fost. %$* 0
uh, every person on this panel agrees that people should play by the rules, and there isn’t anyone up here who has defended breaking the rules. %$* 2
the topic that’s here for debate tonight is, what are the basis of those rules. %$* 2
if there was a rule prohibiting people playing with red hair, we would say of course if you have read hair you can’t play. %$* 2
but we wouldn’t say that that was a sensible rule. %$* 2
so rules have to have some moral basis or some rational basis. %$* 2
the fact that they simply are there doesn’t tell us anything about the basis of them. %$* 2
when we look at what the claims for them are, they seem hypocritical, inconsistent, or based on bad facts. %$* 2
people say they’re based on concerns about fair competition, but sports allow grossly unfair competition, olympic sports, countries against countries, baseball, yankees against brewers, the leagues tolerate unfair competition, so i simply don’t believe them when they say they’re passionately the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” concerned about fair competition. %$* 2
they say they’re concerned about harm. %$* 2
when the president of the— %$* 2
one minute— %$* 0
—national hockey league, says that he’s— has screening for drugs because he’s concerned about the safety and health of the athletes, and there’s no laughter in the press room, you have to really wonder about what’s going on. %$* 2
uh, if you have good arguments you don’t make up things. %$* 2
we have lyle alzado being rolled out again tonight, three times. %$* 2
there’s not a doctor in america who knows anything about steroids and cancer who thinks lyle alzado’s tumor had anything to do with steroids. %$* 2
there’s not another steroid user ever who had the kind of cancer he had. %$* 2
so if the headline had said “lyle alzado, alcohol user, has brain cancer,” i guess we’d be talking about alcohol causing brain cancer. %$* 2
uh, every person on this panel agrees that people should play by the rules, and there isn’t anyone up here who has defended breaking the rules. %$* 2
the topic that’s here for debate tonight is, what are the basis of those rules. %$* 2
if there was a rule prohibiting people playing with red hair, we would say of course if you have read hair you can’t play. %$* 2
but we wouldn’t say that that was a sensible rule. %$* 2
so rules have to have some moral basis or some rational basis. %$* 2
the fact that they simply are there doesn’t tell us anything about the basis of them. %$* 2
when we look at what the claims for them are, they seem hypocritical, inconsistent, or based on bad facts. %$* 2
people say they’re based on concerns about fair competition, but sports allow grossly unfair competition, olympic sports, countries against countries, baseball, yankees against brewers, the leagues tolerate unfair competition, so i simply don’t believe them when they say they’re passionately the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” concerned about fair competition. %$* 2
they say they’re concerned about harm. %$* 2
when the president of the— %$* 2
20 seconds. %$* 0
so the need to roll out misinformation over and over again suggests there’s not much going on the other side. %$* 2
thank you. %$* 2
and now speaking against the motion in summation, dale murphy. %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” well, um, tonight was—it—the, the motion is about performance- enhancing drugs, should they be allowed in sports, i agree with, uh, what has been said, that it wasn’t about breaking the rules. %$* 5
but i’ve also heard performance-enhancing drugs tonight compared to your morning latte, uh, to lasik eye surgery, maybe we should not allow glasses, or a contact lens. %$* 5
uh, but that is not the question, if the question was about alcohol abuse, again, i think we would all love to come back and talk about that. %$* 5
but performance-enhancing drugs is the issue, and to me, this, no matter how long it takes, this is a, a, a battle worth fighting. %$* 5
um, what happens if i’m a major league baseball player under a doctor’s supervision, he tests me, looks at me, looks at my blood pressure, looks at all the factors and decides, you know, dale, i don’t think you are gonna be on our guinea pigs as dr. %$* 5
fost, um, uh, intimated that we, we could use major league baseball players for if we— %$* 5
one minute. %$* 0
—if we let this go. %$* 5
because your blood pressure is, you know, i know you’re trying to have kids, we don’t wanna boost your testosterone. %$* 5
um, it—i—if, if, if it is generally acceptable to use the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” these things in my sport, but i can’t use ‘em or choose not to, i am at, at totally unfair, um, disadvantage. %$* 5
speaking of the yankees, and that they have more money than anybody else. %$* 5
dr. %$* 5
fost must’ve not been following the yankees during the ‘80s. %$* 5
when they had more money than anybody else. %$* 5
if, if somebody with a lot more money than george steinbrenner wants to buy the yankees, again, that is fair competition, you can spend your own money, um, but it doesn’t guarantee success. %$* 5
again, performance-enhancing drugs somehow was linked to the fact that the yankees have an unfair advantage because they have a higher payroll. %$* 5
again, the two don’t compare, that’s what we’re discussing tonight, and— %$* 5
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” well, um, tonight was—it—the, the motion is about performance- enhancing drugs, should they be allowed in sports, i agree with, uh, what has been said, that it wasn’t about breaking the rules. %$* 5

fost, um, uh, intimated that we, we could use major league baseball players for if we— %$* 5
time to wrap up. %$* 0
and, um, to me, again, uh %$* 5
julian mentioned a zero-tolerance rule, that it’s confusing and we don’t know what’s out there. %$* 5
in baseball there is not a zero-tolerance rule. %$* 5
i wish there was, i think we would make great strides. %$* 5
in the—and again, in comparing that to the zero-tolerance— %$* 5
time. %$* 0
—rule we have, on gambling on baseball. %$* 5
we can make progress the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” and change the culture. %$* 5
radley balko. %$* 0
um— i—i’ve been really disturbed over the last month, listening to sports talk radio over %$* 4
the— %$* 4
it’s generally disturbing, radley. %$* 0
yeah. %$* 4
well there—there’s been a, a certain amount of glee and kind of a “gotcha” mentality to, to the marion jones situation and, uh, you know %$* 4
i find it troubling that a woman is—a young woman is being pulled away from her kids, uh, and put in jail, uh, for six months leaving her kids without a mother, uh, for that time, over, uh, you know, a, a decision she made about her own health knowing the risks involved. %$* 4
now granted she broke the rules. %$* 4
but, we’re in a %$* 4
sort of a feeding frenzy about this at this point and it’s a, it’s a common tactic or it’s a common phenomenon, uh, when drug issues hit the media, uh, things tend to spin off into a moral panic. %$* 4
and, we sort of saw it tonight from our opponents, i mean the question tonight, the entire time is what should the rules governing sports be. %$* 4
and, a commoner frame particularly for mr. %$* 4
pound was that, well, we shouldn’t allow— the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 4
um— i—i’ve been really disturbed over the last month, listening to sports talk radio over %$* 4
the— %$* 4
one minute. %$* 0
—performance-enhancing drugs in sports because the rules say we shouldn’t allow them. %$* 4
um, and i guess what i’m hoping you’ll take away from this after listening to our side of this is that maybe, every now and then we should sort of take a step back and examine whether the rules themselves are moral and are justified. %$* 4
and some applause for radley for actually using up only a minute and 120 seconds, wow. %$* 0
that was good. %$* 0
all right. %$* 0
speaking against the motion. %$* 0
and summarizing his viewpoint, george michael. %$* 0
the mother went to jail because mom cheated, not with steroids, but it was a check-cashing scheme, and people like interviewed her a lot, before she ever became a star. %$* 7
and i bought in and believed everything she said when she said she didn’t use. %$* 7
i believed her. %$* 7
so that’s maybe why you might hear a little glee. %$* 7
doctor, about kids. %$* 7
i don’t know if you all have ever heard of efrain marrero. %$* 7
efrain marrero—have you ever heard of him, bob? %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 7
the kicker. %$* 0
no, this is, this is, no, this is his cousin. %$* 7
efrain marrero’s— %$* 7
his cousin— %$* 0
—a kid wanted to play— %$* 7
his cousin— %$* 0
hey. %$* 7
wanted to play baseball. %$* 7
he was good, not great. %$* 7
but he found out, someone told him, he’s 19 years old, he was told use steroids, and you’re gonna be good enough. %$* 7
you’ve got everything you need, just need some more power. %$* 7
so he starts using steroids and he becomes good. %$* 7
this is not make-believe, this is real. %$* 7
efrain marrero, 19 years old, his parents found out, and like good responsible parents dad said, get off that stuff, because he was starting to get a little nutso. %$* 7
get off that stuff or you can never play another baseball game. %$* 7
he obeyed his parents. %$* 7
—a kid wanted to play— %$* 7
no, this is, this is, no, this is his cousin. %$* 7
efrain marrero’s— %$* 7
the mother went to jail because mom cheated, not with steroids, but it was a check-cashing scheme, and people like interviewed her a lot, before she ever became a star. %$* 7
and i bought in and believed everything she said when she said she didn’t use. %$* 7

efrain marrero—have you ever heard of him, bob? %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 7
one minute— %$* 0
and he stopped cold turkey. %$* 7
one week later he went into his the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” bedroom and he blew his brains out. %$* 7
but there’s no evidence, that it was steroids that did it. %$* 7
time up. %$* 7
actually breaking radley’s record by seven seconds. %$* 0
and the last summation comes from julian savulescu. %$* 0
julian. %$* 0
okay, both sides agree that cheating is ruining sport, and that this is really the tip of the iceberg. %$* 6
their position is that we should increase the war on drugs, our position is that we should adopt a policy of regulated access to performance enhancers that are safe enough, and that are consistent with the particular sport’s spirit. %$* 6
this is not a debate about steroids. %$* 6
if indeed, these claims which are largely anecdotal claims are true, that steroids have these terrible effects, our side grants that steroids under those circumstances should be banned. %$* 6
however, that doesn’t deal with the use of human erythropoietin up to a hematacrit of 50 percent, it doesn’t deal with caffeine which is already a performance enhancer that’s been legalized, it doesn’t deal with growth hormone. %$* 6
there are many, many substances, in baseball, you could use modafinil to increase reaction time, you could use new neutropics such as the piracetam family to increase reaction time. %$* 6
these substances may well be safe enough. %$* 6
the question is should performance enhancers be the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” allowed, and there are many performance enhancers, our side believes, which should be allowed. %$* 6
their position is bound to fail, it has been failing, it will fail because the prize money and the sophistication of the drive to technology— %$* 6
45 seconds. %$* 0
paradoxically, it harms athletes. %$* 6
our proposal is enforceable, it frees up the limited resources to focus on drugs that may be affecting children, which we grant should not have access to drugs, it could be focused on drugs which are substantially un— un— harmful to athletes, and drugs which hare against the true spirit of sport. %$* 6
this is not a debate about steroids, it’s about whether performance enhancement itself is against the spirit of sport. %$* 6
as we’ve argued, performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport, it’s been a part of sport through its whole history, and to be human, is to be better, or at least to try to be better. %$* 6
okay, both sides agree that cheating is ruining sport, and that this is really the tip of the iceberg. %$* 6
their position is that we should increase the war on drugs, our position is that we should adopt a policy of regulated access to performance enhancers that are safe enough, and that are consistent with the particular sport’s spirit. %$* 6

julian, thank you. %$* 0
we also thank all of our audience members, and again, though we had a spirited and i think every informative debate i wish we had had more time for questions from the audience, but you do get the final say, because now, you get to decide which side carried the debate. %$* 0
once again, pick up the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” keypad attached to the left armrest of your seat, and after my prompt, press “1” if you are now for the motion, “we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports,” press “2” if you are against the motion, or “3,” if somehow after all this you remain undecided. %$* 0
go ahead and cast your votes. %$* 0
apparently the debate continues even as you cast your votes. %$* 0
and, and after—after we tabulate, i know your question, it’s a good one, and we will, we will pose it, i wanna thank the debaters and the audience, uh, for their participation. %$* 0

and now, very, very briefly, should there be two tiers of sports, olympics or otherwise, one for those who use, one for those who don’t, one on this side, one on that side, 10 seconds. %$* 0
should there be two tiers? %$* 0
why not. %$* 4
why not he says, and uses only one second. %$* 0
should there— should there be two tiers, olympics or otherwise, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” users, non-users— %$* 0
ab—absolutely not, because the, the bad users will pretend that they’re non-users. %$* 3
all right. %$* 0
and now %$* 0
after the debaters did their best to sway you, before the debate, 18 percent of you were for the motion that performance-enhancing drugs should be permissible in competitive sports. %$* 0
after the debate, 37 percent agree with this side of the table. %$* 0
before the debate, 63 percent were against the motion. %$* 0
now 59 percent are against the motion. %$* 0
before the debate, 19 percent of you were undecided, and after the debate, only 4 percent of you wander into the night still shaking your heads, so— in summation, 59 percent against, 37 percent for, so, they improved their position, once the debate was over but not enough— %$* 0
we just ran out of time—we just ran out of time— %$* 3
—not enough to— you didn’t lose, you just ran out of time, many an athlete and coach has voiced the same lament. %$* 0

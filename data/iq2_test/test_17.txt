at this point in the evening, just before we begin, i like to bring out to the stage the gentleman responsible for bringing intelligence squared u.s.to the united states. %$* 13
he is chairman of intelligence squared u.s.-- %$* 13
bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
so what bob normally does is he takes a minute or two to talk about how we got to choosing this topic and where we think the chips fall in the argument. %$* 13
so let's talk, bob, with the side that's arguing for the motion, and this motion is-- %$* 13
and against. %$* 13
it's a double negative. %$* 13
they are-- %$* 13
the u.s.does not need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
and is that basically the same as saying no policy is needed, or does it mean they're asking for a weak u.s. dollar? %$* 13
well, i think what they're saying is that the price of the dollar is a price like any other. %$* 1
it's determined by supply and demand. %$* 1
the dollar is strong right now against the yen and against the pound. %$* 1
it's weak against the euro. %$* 1
and this is just normal economic forces operating. %$* 1
they're probably going to say that at times like this, with the u.s. economy weak, a weaker dollar is actually helpful, because it makes imports more expensive, makes exports cheaper, and therefore encourages domestic growth and domestic employment. %$* 1
and so they would argue that we should just let the dollar go where it goes, and i think there's a point here, which is that the government can control interest rates or they can control the price of the currency, but they cannot do both. %$* 1
so a strong dollar policy is essentially an open mouth policy, and it's an open mouth with no teeth. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
and on the other side of the argument, the team that's arguing for a strong dollar, what do you expect to hear from them? %$* 13
well, i expect to hear from them the importance of the role of the u.s.dollar as a reserve currency. %$* 1
when we were on these enormous fiscal deficits for the government and trade deficits, in order for them to be sustainable, foreign central banks have to be willing to hold the overwhelming majority of their reserves in the form of u.s dollars. %$* 1
and if we pursue a policy that's indifferent to the value of the dollar or, worse, deliberately tries to trash the dollar, they're going to lose confidence. %$* 1
the result will be rising interest rates in the united states, an economic slowdown, and disaster for the u.s. government, which has so much debt outstanding. %$* 1
so if you actually want a track record here, there's a lot of history that both sides can cite which makes the point that this has been going on for a long time. %$* 13
so why bring this to the stage tonight? %$* 13
well, i think tonight we were stimulated to do this in part by the partnership that we have with the richmond center at columbia. %$* 1
it's a joint venture of their law and business schools. %$* 1
and we collectively felt that this was very timely. %$* 1
you can't pick up a newspaper without seeing some kind of discussion about the, quote, artificial strength of the u.s.dollar versus that of our biggest trading partner, china's renminbi. %$* 1
so there's a lot of talk about trashing the dollar relative to china's currency. %$* 1
and then the efficacy of the federal government or the fed's policy on printing money, quantitative easing, is, again, a very hot policy debate right at the moment. %$* 1
it's clearly fueled a stock market rally. %$* 1
it's fueled a turnaround in the housing market, all of which are good things. %$* 1
but clearly whether in the long run it's going to result in a decline in the value of the dollar, and does that really matter? %$* 1
we have four debaters who are raring to go on this. %$* 13
their opinions, i know from talk to them, are very strong, and they're a little bit revved up, so let's bring them out to the stage. %$* 13
indeed. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
have a seat, everyone. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for doing all of this. %$* 13
george washington, andrew jackson, ulysses grant, abraham lincoln: four strong leaders, three of them generals, all of them presidents, and all of them get to have their faces on our money, because we like our leaders strong. %$* 13
but what about the greenbacks that those faces decorate? %$* 13
do we want those dollars to be strong too? %$* 13
of course we do, we normally say. %$* 13
a muscular dollar is a good thing. %$* 13
or is it a goal that is greatly overrated? %$* 13
well, get ready to get current on currency. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: america doesn't need a strong dollar policy, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this policy: american doesn't need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion that america does not need a strong dollar policy, frederic mishkin, a professor at columbia business school and the former governor of the federal reserve. %$* 13
his partner is john taylor. %$* 13
he is chairman and founder of fx concepts. %$* 13
against them, saying that america does need a strong dollar policy, steve forbes. %$* 13
he is chairman and editor of forbes media. %$* 13
and his partner is james grant, editor and founder of grant's interest rate observer. %$* 13
and i'm going to introduce them again. %$* 13
what we just did is going to be used for a television broadcast, and now i'm going to introduce them again, and this will actually be used for our radio broadcast, so your continued enthusiasm and utterly spontaneous applause is working perfectly well. %$* 13
our motion is america doesn't need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome frederic mishkin. %$* 13
and, frederic, and we're going to call you "rick" is your-- %$* 13
is how you like to go, okay. %$* 13
you're a professor at columbia business school. %$* 13
you were a member of the board of governors of the federal reserve. %$* 13
you used to go around the country giving a talk on the issue of whether a certain amount of inflation falls into a comfort zone. %$* 13
the title of your talk was "comfort zones, schmomfort zones." now, this word, " schmomfort," this is a technical economic term that you-- %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 52
yeah, well, we're hoping that all of you will keep it in plain english tonight. %$* 13
can we count on you for that? %$* 13
not necessarily. %$* 52
i thought to make this interesting, i'm going to do the debate both in yiddish and actually-- %$* 52
i was the first person to do that in a federal reserve speech, but i also used latin in this speech. %$* 52
so i'll do it in both languages and see how it goes. %$* 52
thank you. %$* 13
rick mishkin, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and your partner is john taylor. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john taylor. %$* 13
john, you are also arguing that america does not need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
you are chairman and founder of the investment managing company, fx concepts, "fx" being shorthand for "foreign exchange."you've been watching the markets-- %$* 13
currency markets for over 40 years from back in a time when-- %$* 13
before the euro there were french francs, and german deutschmarks, and greek drachmas, and they were all very pretty colorful currencies, do you miss those guys? %$* 13
i sure do. %$* 53
they were fun. %$* 53
they were fun, and they were pretty. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john taylor. %$* 13
our motion is "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." now, here, arguing against that motion, that means they're arguing for a strong dollar policy, first let's welcome steve forbes. %$* 13
steve, you're chairman and editor-in-chief of forbes media. %$* 13
but what thrills all of us up here is that you are the only person on this stage to have once hosted "saturday night live." is that true? %$* 13
and i think that's an event that you-- %$* 13
you guys never did that, right, on the opponents' side? %$* 13
i'm a wild and crazy guy. %$* 52
okay. %$* 13
steve, you are also the only person on our stage to have run for president of the united states twice. %$* 13
if you had won either of those times, what would this debate be about tonight? %$* 13
why the gold standard worke and why rick and john are now in favor of it. %$* 54
ladies and gentlemen, steve forbes. %$* 13
your partner is james grant. %$* 13
you're also arguing against the motion that "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." you're also for a strong dollar. %$* 13
you're editor and founder of grant's interest rate observer a financial markets journal. %$* 13
now, during the 2012 election cycle, ron paul, who, to put it lightly, is not a big fan of the federal reserve, dropped your name as the potential chairman of the federal reserve. %$* 13
what would have been the outcome of that? %$* 13
there would be fewer employees at the fed. %$* 55
fewer employees. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, james grant. %$* 13
and i like that we're seeing a certain economy in the words tonight and the language so far tonight. %$* 13
so our motion is "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." as always, we ask you, our live audience, to act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice, both once before the debate and again after you've heard the arguments and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's have you go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
let's register your preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, our motion is "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." if you agree with the motion, if you think america does not need a strong dollar policy, you push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion, you push number two. %$* 13
that means that you fell america does need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, which in our forum is a perfectly reasonable starting position, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore all of the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you push the key incorrectly, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and what happens at the end of the debate, soon as the debate is-- %$* 13
the third round is over, you vote again, and then about one minute later, thanks to the miracle of computing, we instantly are able to declare a winner. %$* 13
so let's get on to round one. %$* 13
our motion is "america does not need a strong dollar policy." and here to argue first for the motion, frederic “rick” mishkin, professor of banking and financial institutions at columbia business school and a former member of the board of governors of the federal reserve. %$* 13
so just to start, i have to tell you i went to oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, i was a new yorker, she said, "how come you still talk like a new yorker? %$* 52
" so it didn't work. %$* 52
but i never actually went to oxford union debates. %$* 52
and this is actually styled after it. %$* 52
i wish i had. %$* 52
so what i'd like to do first is just to talk about the way that we're going to branch out in terms of my teammate and i.i'm going to focus first on the domestic economy. %$* 52
and actually because of what i do for a living, both in terms of the research i've done and the fact that i was a policy maker at the federal reserve, and my teammate john taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong dollar policy. %$* 52
so let me actually go out and make two points. %$* 52
and the first point is that when we think about what is good policy, i'm going to say what is a good policy for the american economy. %$* 52
and in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now? %$* 52
and two things that i want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle, where are we in terms of unemployment? %$* 52
not very good. %$* 52
we have unemployment rate of 7.7 percent. %$* 52
people are out there struggling. %$* 52
and furthermore, we're in a situation where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level. %$* 52
so in fact we're in a situation where we're not doing as well as we'd like on either component of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy. %$* 52
furthermore, the economy is not growing that fast. %$* 52
it's been growing very, very slowly, hasn't really picked up yet. %$* 52
so we're in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which is on the low side. %$* 52
so now let's ask what would a strong dollar do? %$* 52
well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that would make american goods and services more expensive; if they're more expensive people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services the way they did before. %$* 52
what will that do? %$* 52
that will actually end up lowering the demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken further. %$* 52
is that what we want? %$* 52
absolutely not right now, because we'd actually get an economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower, which has been trending down, it'll go actually down lower. %$* 52
so it's not the right policy at this particular point in time. %$* 52
and so, in that sense, i think that it's a very bad policy to think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar. %$* 52
so that's point one. %$* 52
point two is a little bit more subtle and i'm going to be a little more academic here, that i'm actually going to argue that it's a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong one or a weak one. %$* 52
why? %$* 52
because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal policy, to actually stabilize the economy. %$* 52
at the current juncture we're in a situation where inflation is on the low side, we're actually in a situation where unemployment is on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don't want to have a strong dollar. %$* 52
in fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong-- %$* 52
having tight policy would be the right thing to do. %$* 52
in particular, we raise interest rates rather than keep them low. %$* 52
and that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation. %$* 52
and we've been in periods where, in fact, we've had high inflation, very worried about it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy. %$* 52
that would also result in a stronger dollar, then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction. %$* 52
a stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to go to policies that result in a strong dollar. %$* 52
the point here is that in a situation where you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that's not the ultimate objective for policy makers. %$* 52
the ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have a very strong economy. %$* 52
so i'm going to end a little early, i'm told i get a little points for ending a little early. %$* 52
but i made those two points and clearly there'll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard, which would be fun. %$* 52
i have bad news for you, steve, your wish is not going to be fulfilled. %$* 52
i'm not a big fan of the gold standard. %$* 52
i'm sure we'll discuss that later. %$* 52
but with that, why don't i leave it to the other side? %$* 52
all right. %$* 13
thank you, rick mishkin. %$* 13
so your economical with time, as well, that's very good. %$* 13
our motion is america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy, and here to argue against the motion, james grant. %$* 13
sorry, i was-- %$* 13
i was looking at a page that didn't have your name on it and i thought, "one of us is wrong," but it was me. %$* 13
i forget it-- %$* 55
i forget it sometimes myself. %$* 55
i thought we had gone out of order, but it's my fault. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
our next debater against the motion america doesn't need a strong dollar policy, ladies and gentleman, james grant; he is the editor and founder of grant’s interest rate observer, and originator of the “current yield” column in barrons. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, james grant. %$* 13
what a strange proposition we are wrangling over this evening, ladies and gentlemen, a strong dollar, a not so strong dollar. %$* 55
the dollar is a unit of measurement. %$* 55
it measures the price of everything and anything. %$* 55
it preserves us from barter. %$* 55
it stores the value of work. %$* 55
the sine qua non of any unit of measurement is that it be fixed exacting, unwavering, true. %$* 55
my teammate and i, steve forbes favor a stable dollar so we oppose the motion in the same spirit we support the 12 inch foot, the well calibrated bathroom scale, and the more than 16 ounce serving of mountain dew. %$* 55
now among the enumerated powers of congress is that to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin, and fix the standard weights and measures. %$* 55
the constitutional dollar was no placing of our monetary mandarins; it was a standard like the mile. %$* 55
through most of the nation’s history, a dollar was defined under law as a particular weight of gold and silver, more often of gold, specifically of 23.22 grains fine. %$* 55
a little more than $20 was convertible on request into an ounce of gold, by and by the dollar was redefined. %$* 55
in the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of gold but still, still it was defined, anchored as something. %$* 55
then came the fateful evening of august 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popular horse opera, bonanza, president nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar would have no definition, no anchor. %$* 55
no longer would america’s creditors have the option of converting 35 george washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetary medium that nobody can print. %$* 55
henceforth said nixon, lashing out against unnamed speculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper. %$* 55
and that at least, is one political promise that washington d.c.has faithfully kept. %$* 55
and what has this soft, undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought? %$* 55
well in 1971, the gross public debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of gdp. as of yesterday, the gross public debt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 gdp. %$* 55
now think of the long-grade line of plans and resolutions to bring our national finances under control. %$* 55
the institution of the congressional budget office. %$* 55
gramm-rudman- hollings, the emergency deficit control act, reaffirmation act of 1987, and on and on, and now comes paul ryan. %$* 55
will he be our messiah? %$* 55
well maybe, but i doubt it. %$* 55
as long as the treasury can borrow at 2 percent and as long as the federal reserve can conjure hundreds of billions of what they are pleased to call dollars, with which to buy up these emissions of debt, the red ink will continue to spill. %$* 55
alexander hamilton himself might have succumbed to the temptation. %$* 55
anyway, in 1971, the final year in which the dollar was anchored by something, anything, foreign governments held u.s.government securities on the order of $31 billion. %$* 55
$31 billion. %$* 55
these holdings today top $3.3 trillion. %$* 55
they are the spore of our non-stock deficit on dirt goods and services. %$* 55
consuming more than we produce, americans remit dollars by the boatloads to our asian creditors who obligingly return them by return mail in the shape of american investments in american ious. %$* 55
it’s as if the dollars never left the 50 states. %$* 55
sweet it has been this privilege of america, the privilege of paying its foreign creditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print. %$* 55
but the unprivileged are fighting back. %$* 55
they too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra- low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing. %$* 55
you know, some years ago, the financial times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing, that is to say in laymen’s language, central bank’s conjuring of new paper money secured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it. %$* 55
i finally think i understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote. %$* 55
what i no longer understand is the meaning of the word money. %$* 55
under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance their budgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square up accounts. %$* 55
i don’t have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today. %$* 55
deficits grow and imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetary sense. %$* 55
after all, we are playing tennis without a net. %$* 55
and for that matter, without baselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls. %$* 55
incongruous this is as well, volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated, the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime of weights and measures. %$* 55
and a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projects involve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes to an accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as robert crease relates in his book, "world in the balance."well, well, it's an ill wind that blows no one any good. %$* 55
unanchored exchange rates have created a cottage industry and monetary volatility. %$* 55
john taylor. %$* 55
john taylor, from whom you'll hear in a moment has built a thriving foreign exchange trading business on the ashes of the good as gold dollar. %$* 55
well, just look at the quality of that man's suit. %$* 55
it's a fabulous business. %$* 55
the more the currencies dance and swerve, the better it is for mr. %$* 55
taylor and his hedge fund. %$* 55
to him, as to others in the forex trades, the very idea of monetary stability is-- %$* 55
it's worse than anathema. %$* 55
it's unprofitable. %$* 55
i would no more expect him to espouse a system of stable currencies and fixed exchange rates than i would an oncologist to welcome a cure for cancer. %$* 55
no, that is-- %$* 55
that's not my best one. %$* 55
post-1971 helter-skelter monetary system also favors the prodigious talents of john's sparring partner and my sparring partner, his partner, rick mishkin. %$* 55
the holder of a ph.d.in economics from mit, a prolific author, and coach at fred ought to be at nasa.he should, if for not his sake, for our sake. %$* 55
and so should every holder of a ph.d.in the federal reserve board. %$* 55
ladies and gentlemen, we've alighted from the gold standard over a course of decades into something that we should all regret, the ph.d. standard. %$* 55
thank you, jim grant. %$* 13
our motion is-- %$* 13
well, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligent squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, fighting it out over this motion, "america doesn't need a strong dollar policy." you've heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
debating in support of the motion that "america does not need a strong dollar policy," the chairman and founder of the investment management company fx concepts, and a former vice president at citibank where he headed research for foreign exchange. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john taylor. %$* 13
my cottage business happens to be dealing with the world and the reality in the world, not like jim's which is dealing with the world the way he would like it to be. %$* 53
i would start out by saying that, jim, your first statement to rick was that you would be cutting the number of employees at the fed. %$* 53
i would say that if we follow any of your policies, we'd be cutting the number of employees everywhere. %$* 53
and, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every currency in the world is as good as paper. %$* 53
we're not worse. %$* 53
we're not better. %$* 53
but the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar that's as good as paper is convertible into anything. %$* 53
you don't have to hold those dollars. %$* 53
i give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where i tell people-- %$* 53
i hold up a zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that's worth about 20 cents and tell people that "you shouldn't just keep your money in the united states, you should put your money around the world. %$* 53
you should be free." but the fact of the matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the united states. %$* 53
why can the treasury borrow at 2 percent? %$* 53
they're not forcing you to lend them at 2 percent. %$* 53
they're not forcing the bank of england to invest its money at 2 percent. %$* 53
they're not enforcing the chinese to invest their money at 2 percent. %$* 53
but they do. %$* 53
and, therefore, the dollar has a value. %$* 53
paper or not, it's got a value. %$* 53
and gold is not necessary. %$* 53
also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of course, your currency is zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that. %$* 53
by the way, the latest figure i saw was that the national bank of zimbabwe had $210 in its account. %$* 53
that's the central bank. %$* 53
i don't know. %$* 53
the value's probably changed in the last week or two. %$* 53
but because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and that means brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we're no longer on this standard where the u.s. has a-- %$* 53
you know, there's power over the world, we borrow in our own currency, and everybody else is stuck. %$* 53
they have to, you know, balance their budget, do all the right things. %$* 53
no, unfortunately, in a way, from jim's point of view, and i'm sure steve's, as we'll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much. %$* 53
i don't think it's a good idea, i don't think it's necessarily going to end well. %$* 53
i believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the united states, as my partner rick has pointed out. %$* 53
it would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a very strong impact on the rest of the world. %$* 53
if you're looking at the easy side of this from the u.s.'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have? %$* 53
well, for a start it has a lot of impact on jobs in ohio, in michigan, in places where we actually produce things in the united states, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are to have a manufacturing sector. %$* 53
in 1985, when the u.s.had a strong dollar policy, and after a while a stated strong dollar policy under ronald reagan and volcker, we began to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, "the rust belt."and the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn't produce anything that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong. %$* 53
so now we all drive mercedes and toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that come out of michigan. %$* 53
now, let's face it, michigan has other problems, and if you were-- %$* 53
i know i'm going to get defeated on this, toyotas are all made in the united states, hondas are made in the united states, yeah, in kentucky, tennessee, alabama. %$* 53
there are reasons for that. %$* 53
but the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar-- %$* 53
the weak dollar today has brought these european and japanese companies into the united states, even korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too. %$* 53
one of the things that the japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the toyota plants come back to japan so that they can actually employ japanese to make toyotas instead of people from kentucky or tennessee. %$* 53
so the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren't a hell of a lot of jobs. %$* 53
how does the world do with the dollar? %$* 53
a strong dollar is bad for the world as well. %$* 53
and it's kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if you’ve got a strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us. %$* 53
right? %$* 53
because everything looks cheap to us, right? %$* 53
and i must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look cheap to us. %$* 53
now a lot of things look quite expensive. %$* 53
in fact, one of the worst things about a weak dollar is the fact that we can't go to europe on vacation; it's too damn expensive. %$* 53
if we had a strong dollar, europe would be cheap and we could all go on vacation, but at the same time, all the new york city hotels would be empty, whereas now you walk around the new york city hotels, well, they're just loaded with people from places that i never thought could possibly afford new york. %$* 53
and it's always interesting for me to sit and talk with somebody and have him tell me how much more expensive belgrade is than new york. %$* 53
that's like, "what? %$* 53
you got to be kidding. %$* 53
but they were seriousbut overseas, it's a little difficult to understand, but if the dollar is declining, then it's very inexpensive to build a plant, to finance your trade, because a weak dollar, which is the global currency because the dollar has been out there for years-- %$* 53
a weak dollar is the thing that you finance your trade in. %$* 53
and if you know the dollar is going to be weaker in a year or two or three, you don't repay it. %$* 53
you might be paying 6 percent for your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you're paying minus 4.so it's a gift. %$* 53
so when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from citibank, from jp morgan, from goldman sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system does very well. %$* 53
when the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, "oh, my god, i now owe more for this loan, and my plant that i built in thailand isn't as successful as i thought, and so i have to close it down and i have to lay off workers." so when the dollar gets strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the united states is in a bit of a problem. %$* 53
can we have a strong dollar policy? %$* 53
we argue strongly that we can't, because there is no place for us to do it. %$* 53
we have to support the world. %$* 53
john taylor, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
john taylor. %$* 13
our motion is, america doesn't need a strong dollar policy, and here to argue against the motion, steve forbes, chairman and editor in chief of forbes media and the author of "freedom manifesto: why free markets are moral and big government isn't." %$* 13
thank you. %$* 54
thank you. %$* 54
thank you all very much for coming here tonight. %$* 54
i want to emphasize with jim that we believe in a strong and stable dollar. %$* 54
we don't like inflation; we don't like deflation. %$* 54
we like "flation." stability. %$* 54
this-- %$* 54
so let's lead. %$* 54
what is money? %$* 54
money makes it easier to buy and sell with one another, to do transactions with each other. %$* 54
it is through buying and selling that wealth is ultimately created, doing things, interacting with each other. %$* 54
before we had money, in the old days we had barter. %$* 54
if i sold an ad in forbes magazine 3,000 years ago, how would i get paid? %$* 54
perhaps with a herd of goats. %$* 54
let's say i wanted to buy ipads for our writers, so i go to the ipad store 3,000 years ago with my goats. %$* 54
store owner says he doesn't want goats; he wants sheep. %$* 54
so then i have to figure out how i swap my goats for sheep. %$* 54
perhaps i have to hire a sheep herder so the wolves don't eat the sheep. %$* 54
sheep herder wants to be paid in wine. %$* 54
i've got red wine; he wants white wine. %$* 54
so it becomes very, very cumbersome. %$* 54
money makes all this easier, more convenient to do those transactions. %$* 54
so we got coins in lydia 2,600 years ago. %$* 54
then athens picked it up, became a great commercial and cultural center. %$* 54
got coins, and then paper, and then blips on a computer, but all of it means it makes it easier to do commerce, makes it easier to buy and sell with one another. %$* 54
that's the function of money. %$* 54
if we had barter today, imagine what it would be like, trying to deposit a cow into an atm or take out a pig from an atm.so we have money, and money is like anything, fixed weight and measure. %$* 54
if it has a fixed value, it becomes extremely useful. %$* 54
we have-- %$* 54
when you go to the supermarket, say, buy a pound of hamburger, you assume it has 16 ounces, not 18, not 12.we don't float that pound from the british pound. %$* 54
but you know when you go to the market, 16 ounces. %$* 54
twelve inches in a foot, that doesn't float. %$* 54
imagine building a house 3,000 square feet if the rule floats each day. %$* 54
take-- %$* 54
what would your life be like if the federal reserve did to the clock what it does to the dollar? %$* 54
float the clock. %$* 54
so it's 60 minutes in an hour one day, 20 minutes the next, 22 the next, 90 the next. %$* 54
you'd soon need to have hedges, derivatives futures, to figure out how many hours you're working. %$* 54
so let's say you hire somebody, 15 bucks an hour, do you pay that-- %$* 54
is that a new york hour? %$* 54
new jersey hour? %$* 54
bangladesh hour? %$* 54
let's say you're baking a cake. %$* 54
it says bake the batter 45 minutes. %$* 54
you have to figure out, is that an inflation-adjusted minute? %$* 54
a weak dollar, unstable dollar, makes commerce harder, and it has very destructive impacts. %$* 54
first of all, it misdirects investment. %$* 54
without investment, we don't get a higher standard of living. %$* 54
a weak dollar is like a virus in a computer, corrupts the information. %$* 54
when the dollar becomes weak, what happens to the flow of investment money? %$* 54
it becomes defensive. %$* 54
it goes into commodities. %$* 54
try to preserve what you have instead of invest to grow in the future. %$* 54
you saw it in the 1970s. %$* 54
$3 oil went to $40 a barrel. %$* 54
when reagan and volcker stabilized the dollar in the '80s, crashed down to $10, stabilized to $20. from the mid-1980s to the early part of this last decade when the fed went off the rails again, dollar average-- %$* 54
average price of a barrel of oil more than $21. and now look what it is today, $80, $90. %$* 54
you saw it with the housing. %$* 54
we had an artificial housing boom in the late '70s, even worse one this time. %$* 54
the housing bubble could not have happened without a weak dollar. %$* 54
so you get financial bubbles. %$* 54
another thing that happens is, when you have a week currency, real wages go down, which is why the median income in the country's gone nowhere for 10 years. %$* 54
your salaries go down in real terms, which is why after 40 years of this nonsense, of having floating dollars like a floating clock, it takes two incomes in the family to do what one income could do several generations ago. %$* 54
so when the dollar goes down in value, you pay more for food; you pay more for gas; you pay more for electricity, which means money-- %$* 54
less money for other things. %$* 54
and so u.s.median incomes, as i mentioned, went down. %$* 54
and so workers do better when you have, in terms of improving their standard of living, people do better when they're in countries where the currency is stable, and they do worse in currency-- %$* 54
in countries over time that have weak currencies. %$* 54
it also harms our security. %$* 54
weak money, as i mentioned, has an artificial boost to commodity prices, particularly oil. %$* 54
that means vast transfers of wealth to commodity producers and the like, and also vast transfers lending trillions of dollars to countries unfriendly to the u.s.like iran, venezuela, and russia. %$* 54
weak dollar also has a moral dimension. %$* 54
it undermines social trust. %$* 54
it severs, or certainly weakens, the link between effort and reward. %$* 54
wealth and progress is achieved less by hard work like gaining new skills, perhaps starting a new business, and more by speculation and gambling. %$* 54
weak dollar means windfall gains, as i mentioned, for commodities and for exotic financial instruments and hurts small businesses and many start-ups. %$* 54
faith in the future is undermined because it then suddenly becomes the present. %$* 54
hard work is made a mockery of. %$* 54
you worry about whether you and your children, your grandchildren, are going to have a higher standard of living. %$* 54
the economy seems more like a casino rather than something where hard work can get you a better life. %$* 54
john maynard keynes summed it up very well. %$* 54
keynes said, "lenin was certainly right. %$* 54
there is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than a debauched currency." that is, weaken the currency. %$* 54
the process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner in which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. %$* 54
what this means is, what we see happening today, this feeling that something is not right, this feeling that speculation, doing exotic financial instruments, greedy oil companies and the like is the way to get ahead instead of hard work-- %$* 54
it all relates to a weak and unstable currency. %$* 54
so just as you want 60 minutes in an hour, just as you want 16 ounces in a pounds, just as you want 5,280 feet in a mile, you need stability, fixed measure of value. %$* 54
that's all the dollar is, makes it easier to do commerce when it's stable in value. %$* 54
you do more commerce, pure productive commerce. %$* 54
so bottom line is, wages suffer, investment gets skewed, we don't have a higher standing living that we would have had, and it weakens social trust. %$* 54
stable dollar is what we need, not funny money from politicians who think they know how to do our lives better than we do. %$* 54
thank you. %$* 54
thank you, steve forbes. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
here's where we stand at the beginning of round two. %$* 13
our motion is, america doesn't need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
arguing in support of that motion, in other words arguing against a strong dollar policy, we have fred mishkin and john taylor. %$* 13
they have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts. %$* 13
it hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity. %$* 13
and the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy. %$* 13
the team arguing against, and that means they're arguing for a strong dollar, james grant and steve forbes, are arguing, yes, we do need a strong dollar, that a strong dollar is one that is fixed, that money was invented to represent and hold value so that business could be done. %$* 13
when that doesn’t happen, when your 12 inch ruler doesn't have 12 inches anymore, the meaning of money begins to slip out of sight. %$* 13
they said specifically, workers do better when the economy is stable, and workers-- %$* 13
the workers do better when the currency is stable, and worse when it's not. %$* 13
i want to put that question to their opponents. %$* 13
to ric mishkin. %$* 13
you’re arguing that america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
steve forbes is saying workers do better with a strong dollar policy. %$* 13
so the first thing i should tell you is, i actually am proud that i have a ph.d.and that i’m a rocket scientist. %$* 52
what can i tell you. %$* 52
but i, first i want to talk about, i think that there’s a sense jujitsu going on in that i actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run-- %$* 52
overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy. %$* 52
and in that context, you’re absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing. %$* 52
i’m in no way advocating that. %$* 52
and indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, i think doesn’t fly. %$* 52
so let me give you reasons why. %$* 52
if you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth let’s say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period. %$* 52
the problem is that you’re now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars. %$* 52
and in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasn’t a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now. %$* 52
now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of god. %$* 52
so indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880-- %$* 52
from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldn’t find any gold. %$* 52
then we had the klondike and south africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground. %$* 52
so there’s really an issue of technology here. %$* 52
the question is, can you actually get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which alan greenspan i think said rightly so, is it’s like pornography, you know it when you see it. %$* 52
it’s when you don’t worry about what’s happening to the price level in your day to day decisions. %$* 52
we completely agree that that’s the right way to run the economy. %$* 52
i think that’s - %$* 55
jim grant. %$* 13
i can speak to the period of the 1890s. %$* 55
i’m older than you and i remember it very well. %$* 55
and your critique of the gold standard, if i may say, i think, reveals some of the weaknesses of the federal reserve’s approach to our monetary affairs of the present day. %$* 55
the fed has its knives out for the thing they are pleased to call deflation. %$* 55
you, ladies and gentleman, might know this as every day low and lower prices. %$* 55
most americans spend most of the weekend looking for the thing the fed deplores. %$* 55
the fed means to create this amount of credit such that prices do not dwindle, fall, weaken. %$* 55
now, what will you expect prices to do in a world of technological wonder in which hundreds of millions of willing new hands are added to the world’s labor force? %$* 55
in which digital technology breaks down the barriers to production the world over. %$* 55
in which marvels of engineering shove each other out of the news every day. %$* 55
we can’t keep up with the rate of gain in productivity. %$* 55
what will you expect price to do? %$* 55
well prices, i would suppose dwindle, the supply curve is shifting downward and to the right. %$* 55
therefore prices might benignly fall. %$* 55
the fed will have none of it. %$* 55
the fed insists on creating that amount of dollars that will deliver unto us that measure of inflation the fed thinks we need, namely two percent, which by the way, they can’t really measure. %$* 55
so what we have is persistent credit bubbles, in the name of what they are pleased to call price stability. %$* 55
which is not price stability, it’s-- %$* 55
all right jim, let me step in for a moment because you actually made that point in your opening statement. %$* 13
and what i want to do is break down some of the points that were made in the opening statements. %$* 13
and i asked you a question fred, rick, that you didn’t answer, and i’m very sensitive to that reality. %$* 13
steve’s point that workers do better when a currency is stable and worse when it’s not. %$* 13
can you respond to that directly? %$* 13
then i want steve to-- %$* 13
workers do better when there is low and stable inflation, that we agree on. %$* 52
and in fact, low and stable inflation means that it’s not fluctuating a lot. %$* 52
so what is he saying that’s different from what you believe? %$* 13
because what he’s saying that’s different is that he wants a fixed value of the currency, the dollar, in terms of a commodity, let’s say gold. %$* 52
and that actually is not a situation where it produces stability in the price level. %$* 52
during the gold standard, the price level went up, went down. %$* 52
now you are right, that over very long rises, over 40 year period, there was no change in price level. %$* 52
that’s the good news. %$* 52
the bad news is, that horizons are not 40 years. %$* 52
as cain said, in the long run, we’re all dead. %$* 52
okay, steve forbes. %$* 13
back to your point. %$* 13
bring us some examples or make the case in specific terms about the stable currency being good for workers. %$* 13
well again, what prices do is, should be determined by a free market. %$* 54
we’ve had a huge fall in the price of memory. %$* 54
you take an ipod today. %$* 54
memory costs what, $40, $50? %$* 54
ten years ago, it would have cost $10,000.so as jim said, with productivity prices might go down, which is good for us. %$* 54
so in terms of the free markets, prices may go up, may go down. %$* 54
you have a drought, they'll go up. %$* 54
again, the money should be stable in value. %$* 54
the united states, from the time we went on the gold standard in 1789 right through-- %$* 54
some on and offs, through '71, had one of the most extraordinary growth periods in human history. %$* 54
we surpassed our neighbors in latin america. %$* 54
we surpassed europe in terms of growth, which is why we attracted more immigrants than any other country in the world where it seems a place of opportunity. %$* 54
and one of the key things that hamilton and washington brought in was realizing if you fool around with the money, what that does is hurts commerce. %$* 54
people hold physical assets instead of going out, and doing, and investing in the future. %$* 54
you know, when you invest something, john, you don't know whether-- %$* 54

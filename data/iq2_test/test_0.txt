and now i’d like to introduce robert rosenkranz, who is the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, and the sponsor of intelligence squared, who will frame tonight’s debate. %$* 0
bob? %$* 0
this is bob. %$* 0
well thank you very much. %$* 1
and, uh, uh, on behalf of, uh, dana wolfe, our executive producer and myself, uh, i’m just, uh, thrilled to welcome you. %$* 1
when we scheduled this event some, uh, five months ago, we had no idea it would be so timely. %$* 1
just in the past month the, uh, mitchell report was released, naming some eighty eight major league baseball players alleged to have used steroids and, uh, uh, other drugs. %$* 1
roger clemens’ denials have been heard in 60 minutes and were front page news in sunday’s new york times. %$* 1
uh, record breaking sprinter marion jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison-, or six months, i the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” should say, in prison, for lying to a federal grand jury about steroid use. %$* 1
uh, congressional hearings, uh, on steroid use and the mitchell report actually started today in washington. %$* 1
uh, closer to home, just a few days ago, ben johnson dropped out as our panelist on his counsel’s insistence, because of johnson’s involvement in a le-, a related legal case that was just noticed for trial. %$* 1
well timely we certainly are, but what is the debate? %$* 1
this is not a debate about whether cheating in sports should be accepted. %$* 1
that would hardly be interesting. %$* 1
instead, it’s about whether the rules governing professional sports should ban performance-enhancing drugs. %$* 1
after all, we routinely use performance-enhancing drugs, uh, to enhance our, uh, mental performance. %$* 1
a virtual pharmacopoeia of drugs is used to help people, including minors, stay awake, improve concentration, alter moods. %$* 1
and the whole point of competitive sports is for spectators to see athletes striving to be the very best they can be. %$* 1
we want their training and equipment to use the best science and technology. %$* 1
so why is the use of performance-enhancing drugs an exception? %$* 1
is there persuasive evidence that these drugs are health risks? %$* 1
if so, how do those risks stack up against the risk athletes assume every day by getting into a racing car or a boxing ring, or on a football field or a baseball diamond? %$* 1
why shouldn’t athletes make their own informed determinations about risks and benefits of performance-enhancing drugs? %$* 1
and how should we the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” think about the wisdom of rules that are inherently so intrusive and difficult to enforce? %$* 1
well to help us grapple with these interesting questions, we have an exciting panel, including professional athletes and medical experts. %$* 1
and as our moderator, we have bob costas, perhaps the most famous sportscaster in television and radio today. %$* 1
bob, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you again, bob. %$* 0
so this is the sixth debate of the second intelligence squared us series. %$* 0
the resolution being debated tonight is formally, you know what it is, but formally it is, we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports. %$* 0
here’s a brief overview of the way the evening will work. %$* 0
members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument, and the presentations are limited to seven minutes each. %$* 0
when opening arguments are complete, i’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 0
and after the q&a, each debater will make a final two minute summation. %$* 0
and finally, you vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat, and i’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day or the evening, when, uh, the festivities conclude. %$* 0
let’s start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 0
please pick up the keypad attached to the armrest on your left. %$* 0
for audience members sitting along the aisle to my right, your keypad is attached to the audience on your right side next to your the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” neighbor. %$* 0
so, the resolution is, we should accept performance- enhancing drugs in competitive sports. %$* 0
after my prompt, please press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion, or three if you are undecided. %$* 0
you may begin voting now. %$* 0
has everybody cast their initial vote? %$* 0
you’re all set? %$* 0
all right. %$* 0
now to introduce the panel. %$* 0
and please hold your applause until all six are introduced. %$* 0
for the motion, former policy analyst for the cato institute, senior editor and investigative journalist for reason magazine, radley balko on the far end. %$* 0
professor of pediatrics and bio-ethics, and director of the program in medical ethics at the university of wisconsin, norman fost. %$* 0
and uehiro chair in practical ethics at the university of oxford, and director of the oxford center for practical ethics, julian savulescu. %$* 0
against the motion, former host and creator of the sports machine, the award-winning sportscaster george michael. %$* 0
the former atlanta brave two-time national league mvp, multiple golden glo-, glove award-winner, and founder of the i won’t cheat foundation, dale murphy. %$* 0
and the former chairman of the world anti-doping agency from 1999 through 2007, chancellor of mcgill university and partner at the canadian law firm stikeman elliot, richard pound. %$* 0
for most of the evening as points of view are exchanged, all of us will be seated, but as each debater makes his initial seven minute presentation, we will call him to the podium. %$* 0
and we will begin the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” with someone who is for the motion, “we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports,” norm fost. %$* 0
norm? %$* 0
thank you. %$* 2
everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing technology and drugs. %$* 2
we use cars and computers to make our work more efficient. %$* 2
we use caffeine, alcohol, and viagra to improve our performance. %$* 2
we send our children to fancy schools and suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills, and enhance their musical ability. %$* 2
and every athlete in recorded history has used performance-enhancing drugs. %$* 2
babylonians and romans used herbs to improve their performance in battle. %$* 2
naked greeks put on shoes to run faster. %$* 2
kenyan runners trained at altitude to improve their oxygen-carrying capacity. %$* 2
and runners everywhere carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance. %$* 2
why then, do we have a replay of the salem witch trials? %$* 2
to discredit, humiliate, and incarcerate, uh, elite athletes for doing what has been a standard practice for millennia? %$* 2
and why, out of the thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their performance, have steroids and growth hormone been selected for particular vilification? %$* 2
the short answer is that they’re illegal and that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law, and therefor it’s immoral. %$* 2
but this begs the question, as mr. %$* 2
rosenkranz said, why are they banned in the first place? %$* 2
we the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent, wreak of hypocrisy, and are based on ice cold wrong information. %$* 2
i will identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these drugs. %$* 2
number one, critics say that they confer an unfair advantage. %$* 2
but advantages are only unfair if they’re unequally distributed. %$* 2
the usual solution is to expand access. %$* 2
when bob seagren showed up at the ’72 olympics in-, with a fiberglass pole, it was not banned, but, a-, uh, there was a time to allow others to practice with it, and it was incorporated. %$* 2
when kenyan runners were found to enhance their performance by raising their hemoglobin by training at altitude, the reaction was not to ban abnormally high hemoglobins, or to prohibit others from training at altitude, but to encourage everyone to do it. %$* 2
the unfair advantage aim, uh, the unfair advantage claim is further undermined by rampant hypocrisy. %$* 2
in the ’88 olympics, when ben johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use, on the same day and the same press den, janet evans, the american swimmer who had won the 5k swim, bragged about the greasy swimsuit that we had kept secret from the east germans. %$* 2
johnson used a drug that was available to everyone, although illegally, virtually on the training room tables. %$* 2
evans used a secret technology available to none of her competitors and bragged about it. %$* 2
the press cheered american ingenuity and made johnson a pariah. %$* 2
bud selig, the baseball commissioner, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” preaches about a level playing field, but presides over a league where the yankees’ payroll is three to four times that of most competitors, including my beloved brewers, and guess what? %$* 2
the yankees always make the playoffs. %$* 2
two, critics say these drugs are harmful, but they rely on information that’s wiley-, wildly exaggerated or just fabricated. %$* 2
we are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease, cancer, and stroke, while human growth hormone has been given to almost a million children for fifty years, and there’s still no real serious side effects that have been discovered. %$* 2
oral testosterone dis-, did cause liver cancer, but for twenty years athletes have been using injectables, which have never been associated with cancer. %$* 2
lyle alzado the football player, was a poster child for the horrors of steroids. %$* 2
he died of a brain tumor. %$* 2
then the new york times and sports illustrated told us on cover stories that this was due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician or a single source showing any association with steroids, because there is none. %$* 2
but still, costas, i mean, excuse me, uh, %$* 2
alzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the horrors of steroids. %$* 2
i ask you in the audience to quickly name, in the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” your own minds, a single elite athlete who’s had a stroke or a heart attack while playing sports. %$* 2
it’s hard to come up with one. %$* 2
anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes, intrangent infertility. %$* 2
but sport itself is far more dangerous, and we don’t prohibit it. %$* 2
the number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids. %$* 2
more people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use. %$* 2
three critics say that allowing their use is coercive, that you’re forced to use them. %$* 2
but the first year that baseball did universal testing, anonymous testing, only six percent of the players were positive. %$* 2
from those numbers, it seems that 94% were able to play at a very high level and didn’t feel coerced at all. %$* 2
coercion is the use or threat of force that's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge. %$* 2
there is no entitlement to play professional sports; it’s a privilege requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks, with or without steroids. %$* 2
many walk away from it and choose not to do it, and no one is forced to take it on. %$* 2
four, critics claim that steroids undermine fan interest, and this is simply empirically false, baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the steroid era, professional football is even more popular, and barry bonds, widely assumed to be a steroid user, is the biggest draw in sports, adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” goes. %$* 2
chicks love the long ball, guys love the long ball, they don’t care what they're using. %$* 2
fifth, critics claim that steroids undermine the integrity of records. %$* 2
this is naïve, the records are not comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone. %$* 2
baseball fences are shorter, the mound is lower, the ball is livelier, and coors field is a mile above sea level. %$* 2
by one estimate, babe ruth playing in today’s ball parks would hit a thousand home runs, not the mere seven hundred and fifty that hank aaron and bonds have hit. %$* 2
the only valid comparison is with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment against the same opponents, and ruth hit more home runs in one season than any other team. %$* 2
he is in a league of his own, and no one has come close. %$* 2
finally, critics claim that steroids present bad role modeling for children— %$* 2
everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children. %$* 2
the adverse effects are different, they stunt growth, they are not competent to make informed choices. %$* 2
i support testing in schools, not to punish the kids, but to catch the peddlers. %$* 2
anyone caught selling drugs to children should be hung, followed by a fair trial. %$* 2
in closing, when you go out to dinner tonight, enjoy the wine that relaxes you, or start your day the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” tomorrow with a double mocha latte that gets you going, but please be less critical of others who, like you, try to enhance their performance in a variety of ways. %$* 2
thank you. %$* 2
that is deep-, deeply, deeply freudian. %$* 0

thank you, dr. %$* 0
fost. %$* 0
and now speaking against the motion, dick pound. %$* 0
thank you. %$* 3
this evening’s debate deals with one of the most important problems facing sport today: doping, the use of performance enhancing drugs and methods. %$* 3
it’s important because it affects the health of the athletes who practice it, and those who emulate the sport heroes thought they admire. %$* 3
it’s important because it goes to the very heart of sport and its integrity. %$* 3
i want to focus on two elements in this portion of my remarks: health and integrity. %$* 3
so let’s start at the beginning. %$* 3
sport, like this debate, is governed by rules, to which the participants agree. %$* 3
in fact, the rules are the essential element of sport as we know it. %$* 3
some of them may seem arbitrary, why the race is a hundred meters as opposed to ninety-five or a hundred and five, but they are the rules, and they are the rules on which we agree. %$* 3
one of those sport rules is that participants do not take certain drugs or use certain methods for performance enhancement. %$* 3
and also, we should be clear here, until there is a rule against the use of something, it may be foolish, it may be the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” dangerous, but it can't be criticized as a breach of ethics or a rule of conduct. %$* 3
don’t get led off into the wilderness by examples from ancient greece and so forth that preceded the rules that we now face today. %$* 3
once there is a rule, however, that becomes the deal, and part of the game, whether the rule relates to drugs, equipment, or anything else central to the sport. %$* 3
and those rules become our deal with each other’s, other, as participants. %$* 3
if you don’t like the rules, unlike society in general, you're not obliged to participate. %$* 3
you can find somebody who wants to play by the rules that you prefer. %$* 3
almost all of the prohibited substances and methods have the potential to damage the health of the athletes. %$* 3
in the 1950’s and 1960’s before there were rules, veterinary products were used to beef up the human cattle. %$* 3
shot putters went from throwing from sixty feet to seventy feet. %$* 3
it’s true, they had terminal acne, testicles the size of jelly beans, a sperm count of zero, and were in a perpetual rage, but boy, they could sure toss the shot a lot further. %$* 3
the initial anti-doping rules were adopted mainly as a result of concerns regarding health. %$* 3
a danish cyclist died during the 1960 olympics in rome, that was the olympics in which i participated. %$* 3
and he died as a result of drug use. %$* 3
he didn't just get sick, or incur a long term health problem, or fall off his bike and skin his knees. %$* 3
he died. %$* 3
if a particular sport rule proves to be no good or unnecessary, or in need of amendment, the sport can change it. %$* 3
there’s no problem the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” about that. %$* 3
but you as a participant cannot do it unilaterally and clandestinely. %$* 3
why do you suppose that no one, no one with any responsibility, let me underline that, is willing to say let the athletes do whatever they want? %$* 3
even the professional leagues don’t say that. %$* 3
they know perfectly well there’s a danger to health. %$* 3
with the rules comes a question of trust. %$* 3
we have expectations of each other that we play in accordance with the rules that we agreed upon as part of our participation, including rules prohibiting drug use. %$* 3
we’re ready to demonstrate that compliance at any time, that’s also part of our deal. %$* 3
we don’t hide behind spurious claims of privacy. %$* 3
we agree on the penalties if there’s a breach of the rules. %$* 3
and the sport rules on drug use are no different from sport rules regarding such things as gambling. %$* 3
pete rose has been kept out of the baseball hall of fame because of gambling, because nobody was really sure whether they were watching real sport. %$* 3
in the, in more modern times, my, my view is that henry aaron has a record, barry bonds has a number. %$* 3
when there’s a breach of that trust, you have to see what it is. %$* 3
and drug use in sport is no more or no less than cheating, and in most cases, dangerous cheating. %$* 3
remember that, that athletes don’t take these drugs to level the playing field. %$* 3
they do it to get an advantage. %$* 3
and if everyone else is doing what they're doing, then instead of taking ten grams or ten cc's or whatever it is, they’ll take twenty, or thirty, or forty, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” and a vicious circle simply gets bigger. %$* 3
the end game will be an activity that’s increasingly violent, extreme, and meaningless, practiced by a class of chemical and/or genetic mutant gladiators. %$* 3
the use of performance enhancing drugs is not accidental, it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of getting an unfair advantage. %$* 3
i don’t want my kids, or your kids, or anybody’s kids to have to turn themselves into chemical stockpiles just because there are cheaters out there who don’t care what they promised when they started to participate. %$* 3
i don’t want my kids in the hands of a coach who would encourage, condone, or allow the use of drugs among his or her athletes. %$* 3
i was always struck by vince lombardi, a wonderful coach. %$* 3
there’s one thing he said that i wish he hadn't, when he said, “winning is the only thing.” it’s not. %$* 3
i liked it much better when he said, “if you're not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.” that’s a much better message. %$* 3
so, going forward, what we need is an increased change of attitude. %$* 3
cheating in sport destroys everything— %$* 3
that the athletes set out to accomplish. %$* 3
it turns them, among other things, into liars. %$* 3
marion jones persisted with a lie for more than seven years. %$* 3
ben johnson lied to me in 1988.i was the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” really looking forward to having him here tonight, twenty years later. %$* 3
it’s too bad his lawyers pulled him out of this at the last minute. %$* 3
but attitudes can change, even big attitudes like this. %$* 3
if, if ten years ago i had said that in ten years from today it would be illegal to smoke a cigarette in a restaurant in paris, you’d have laughed. %$* 3
so, it’s important for me to keep up, keep the question of doping and drug use from becoming banal and being turned into various shades of gray. %$* 3
the issue of cheating is not gray, it’s black and it’s white. %$* 3
drug use may not affect fan interest, but it should, and that's our failure as fans, compounding the failure of drug-using players in the leagues. %$* 3
are these really our personal values, that dangerous cheating is what we stand for? %$* 3
bishop, let me finish with bishop fulton sheen, he had a great thing. %$* 3
he said, if it’s wrong, it’s wrong. %$* 3
even if everybody is doing it. %$* 3
and if it’s right it’s right, even if nobody’s doing it. %$* 3
one minute. %$* 0
that the athletes set out to accomplish. %$* 3
it turns them, among other things, into liars. %$* 3

please finish up. %$* 0
are these really our personal values, that dangerous cheating is what we stand for? %$* 3
bishop, let me finish with bishop fulton sheen, he had a great thing. %$* 3
he said, if it’s wrong, it’s wrong. %$* 3
even if everybody is doing it. %$* 3
and if it’s right it’s right, even if nobody’s doing it. %$* 3
our thanks to dick pound, and uh, i indicate no disapproval of the opinions about to be expressed by radley balko when i note that he is ironically named to be on themselves panel. %$* 0
radley, radley balko, for the motion that performance enhancing drugs the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” in competitive sports should be accepted. %$* 0
well, let me start by saying, for those of you who might be confused, i am not ben johnson. %$* 4
on the train ride from dc this morning, we passed through baltimore. %$* 4
doing so reminded me of one of my favorite authors, baltimore native h.l.mencken, who i think would have had a good laugh at the hypocrisy, the posturing, the uh, moral prudery that’s associated with this steroid controversy. %$* 4
eighty years ago mencken aptly summarized this debate when he wrote, quote, “the urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.” so why are we here tonight? %$* 4
is this about saving sport, or is this about some people imposing their view about what sport should be? %$* 4
if we’re here to talk about fairness in competition, i'm dubious. %$* 4
take representative tom davis, one of the more cam-, camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue. %$* 4
after the 2000 census, representative davis maneuvered to have his congressional district gerrymandered to include as many republicans as possible, ensuring his continual reelection, eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to vote. %$* 4
he ran the next year unopposed. %$* 4
davis also snuck a, a provision into an unrelated piece of federal legislation preventing an apartment complex from going up in his district because, he told the washington post, he feared it would bring too many the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” democrats into the district. %$* 4
this guy is cheating at democracy, and he’s lecturing baseball players about fairness. %$* 4
if we want to talk about the health risks of professional sports, we might discuss the ballooning weight of nfl lineman over the last twenty years, or the corresponding life, drop in life expectancy that’s come with it. %$* 4
or you might talk about the particularly hellish world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys, who subject themselves to sweat boxes, diuretics, suppositories, and intentional eating disorders. %$* 4
in fact, any world class athlete subjects his body to stresses it wasn’t really designed to endure. %$* 4
and as we’ve seen with government bans on consensual activity, from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution, prohibitions not only don’t work, they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground. %$* 4
so what about the children? %$* 4
survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years. %$* 4
it went up mildly in the 1990’s, and has since either dropped off slightly, or leveled off since 2000.it’s likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than what’s happening in the sports pages. %$* 4
in fact, a study released last year, and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen’s own self, self esteem and body image. %$* 4
the suggestion, and i think we can all the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” agree it’s pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like barry bonds or mark mcgwire, but because they want to look good for teenage girls. %$* 4
so what is this debate really all about? %$* 4
i’d suggest it’s about paternalism, and it’s about control. %$* 4
we have a full blown moral panic on our hands here, and it’s over a set of substances that, for whatever reason, has attracted the ire of the people who have made it their job to tell us what is and isn't good for us. %$* 4
our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology. %$* 4
if something could be said to be natural, we tend to be ok with it. %$* 4
if it’s lab made or synthetic, we tend to be leery. %$* 4
but even synthetic drugs and man-made technology seem to be ok if the aim is to make sick people better, or broken people whole again. %$* 4
and so when we talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be normal, uh, then a certain uneasiness starts to set in. %$* 4
there was an article in the chronicle of higher education last month about university professors taking stimulants like adderall to increase their academic productivity. %$* 4
oddly, the article quoted, quoted several professors who considered this cheating at academics. %$* 4
i have to confess, i really don’t understand this way of thinking. %$* 4
academics is the search for truth and knowledge, if a drug can make that search more productive with few side effects, why in the world wouldn't you take it? %$* 4
it’s also important to note that the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not too long ago. %$* 4
a hundred years ago life expectancy in the us was fifty, today it’s seventy-eight. %$* 4
thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceutical, we’re today taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and expecting to live longer than ever before. %$* 4
genetically advanced agriculture, anti-aging technology, and other advancements we’ve yet to see today will likely push our longevity even farther. %$* 4
it’s an old cliché that sports is a metaphor for the human condition, but there’s a lot of truth to that. %$* 4
as technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of these milestones, and helped us move beyond what, until a hundred years ago, had been a long, bleak history, similar advances over the years in nutrition, training, and using technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to fall with astonishing regularity. %$* 4
sports is about exploring and stretching the lengths of human potential. %$* 4
going back to even the pre-modern olympics, when athletes ate live bees, and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, uh, sports has never been about physical ability alone. %$* 4
it’s been, been about ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger, and avoiding what might do us harm. %$* 4
it’s always been part of the game. %$* 4
it shouldn't be surprising, then, that many of the biggest proponents of banning performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” of these continued advancements in human achievement. %$* 4
leon kass, former, formerly president bush’s top advisor on bio-ethics, this is the same mr. %$* 4
kass who champions rigorous sports testing, has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that human beings are living longer than ever before. %$* 4
he considers this contrary to some odd concept of natural order. %$* 4
uh, of course there have been luddites and naturalists like mr. %$* 4
kass standing athwart the tide— %$* 4
of human progress for much of human history. %$* 4
the essence of the agreement today i think is what people like mr. %$* 4
kass and some of our opponents tonight, they have a decidedly different definition of what’s pure, natural, and human than what i do. %$* 4
i think the difference is that i'm sort of willing to take a live and let live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own boundaries and their own potential. %$* 4
um, whereas i think some of our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what is natural and what is, uh, human on everyone else, which of course brings us back to mencken. %$* 4
i think, uh, our opponents want to legislate away what they believe are bad decisions, and if a free society means anything, it means we should be able to make all decisions, including the bad ones. %$* 4

the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” radley balko, thank you. %$* 0
and now speaking against the motion, dale murphy. %$* 0
to, to accept this motion would simply set us back. %$* 5
accurately just mentioned, studies, recent studies are showing that young athletes and high school kids are, are using performance enhancing drugs to a lesser degree. %$* 5
to legitimize, um, the performance enhancing drugs in sports i feel would send the wrong message to young athletes. %$* 5
there are certainly legitimate uses for human growth hormone and steroids, um, as, as we all know. %$* 5
that’s why they’re a controlled substance under a doctor’s orders. %$* 5
but to hit a baseball further, or to run a hundred yard dash faster is not the reason and the legitimate use of these, uh, of these drugs. %$* 5
um, dr. %$* 5
fost mentioned that at one point in time there were six percent that were using, um, performance enhancing drugs in the major leagues. %$* 5
it really makes my point exactly. %$* 5
ninety-four percent of the guys were not using, then that tells me that you don’t need these things to be the best athlete in the world, that there are plenty of legitimate ways to get bigger, stronger, and faster that everyone has access to, equal access to. %$* 5
um, if accepted, what about those, for instance, in major league baseball, what about those who do not want to use it? %$* 5
the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” playing field, then, once again, is, is not level. %$* 5
um, the only way, someone said earlier, the only way you could probably make this work is that if you forced everybody to take performance enhancing drugs, which um, we all know wouldn't work. %$* 5
um, people do not want to see, i would argue the point that people do not want to see performances, uh, based on, uh, false premises, that it is, it is their ability, athletically or psychologically or mentally, alone, um, that if it’s being enhanced people do not want, accept that. %$* 5
you mentioned barry bonds adding, um, seats, um, fans in the seats every game he played. %$* 5
i would have to say that in san francisco he was, um, generally accepted, but everywhere else he went, i think those ten thousand extra went there to jeer him and his accomplishments. %$* 5
after the season, after all this has come out with mark mcgwire, i think most of us look back now and say we got caught up in something that we really didn't want to support. %$* 5
if there was no alternative, i could understand us giving into this problem. %$* 5
certainly there are a lot of problems that young people have and society has. %$* 5
but this is one of them. %$* 5
if, uh, if there are a, a percentage of young athletes still taking performance enhancing drugs, to me it’s still a problem. %$* 5
um, and if there was no answer to, uh, this problem i think i would understand giving in, and voting, uh, in favor of this motion. %$* 5
but i believe that there is a pro—there is an answer to the problem. %$* 5
and, uh, as was mentioned earlier we look at the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” smoking in public. %$* 5
uh, we— most of us grew up with that being totally acceptable and now it’s against the law, there’s truly been a culture change. %$* 5
there can be a change in culture in professional athletics, and i believe that it is starting. %$* 5
we need, uh, better testing, harsher punishments, and, and people will decide not to get involved with performance-enhancing drugs. %$* 5
uh, gambling in baseball is the perfect example. %$* 5
um, the culture of, uh, professional baseball players is the one thing they know, and, and one thing they learn from the minute they sign a professional contract, is that if you gamble on the game in any way, shape or form, your career will be over. %$* 5
uh, my understanding is, uh, i don’t have any statistics to show this, but once one of the greatest hitters, uh, is kicked out of the game because he gambled on the sport, that reinforced the culture in baseball that you don’t gamble on baseball. %$* 5
i believe we can change the culture, and to accept this motion, really would set us back with the progress that we have made. %$* 5
after tonight, i think you will see—you will feel, uh, as you listen closely, that, you feel as i do, that there is no sustainable, logical, reasonable, um, uh %$* 5
reason, for these things to be accepted. %$* 5
if you put any of these, uh, alleg—these, uh, positions under scrutiny, i think you will all come to understand, that we simply do not need this in sports at any level. %$* 5
let alone the high school kids that see professional athletes and are tempted to use them. %$* 5
if you put an age limit on the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” use, you’re still gonna have abuse at the younger ages. %$* 5
to me it’d be much better %$* 5
to change the culture and the idea and the thinking about competing in sports. %$* 5
and we are making progress, and studies have shown that. %$* 5
certainly we don’t want all of our athletes to look like the american gladi—gladiators or professional wrestlers. %$* 5
if, if that’s what we want, with all of our ath—athletes, um, then i can understand that but i don’t think that’s what the public wants. %$* 5
as far as baseball is concerned, certainly people like the long ball. %$* 5
um, but, uh, this, this past year was, in the la—in the last 10 years, this past year, had the seventh fewest home runs of the last decade, and yet we broke records again with attendance. %$* 5
attendance is good, home runs do not have to be up. %$* 5
people love the game, they appreciate the game, they appreciate finesse. %$* 5
um, again, we don’t all want to look like professional wrestlers out there and i don’t think that’s what the fans want. %$* 5
i think the, uh, um %$* 5
the thing too you need to be careful about is drawing, uh, as— %$* 5
—as was mentioned earlier is drawing, um, the opposing side, drawing, drawing analogies and conclusions, with things that really are not, uh, are not comparable. %$* 5
for instance— um, um, comparing, uh, anabolic steroids or performance-enhancing the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” drugs to the greeks wearing tennis shoes. %$* 5
or to the ancient greek athletes, uh, eating bees. %$* 5
this is not what we’re talking about and that is not—to me does not compare, what we’re talking about, is drugs that are a controlled substance that have very many good, legitimate uses. %$* 5
as was mentioned over a million kids take human growth hormone, they don’t take human growth hormone without exhaustive studies to make sure that they are not already producing enough on their own. %$* 5
when kids abuse these drugs, and athletes abuse these drugs, i don’t think there’s any question that we know, uh, that there are side effects. %$* 5
and some of ‘em we do not know now. %$* 5
especially with our use. %$* 5
what concerns me is the example that the athletes at the highest level set for our youth. %$* 5
i feel like we’re making progress and a vote in favor of this motion would, would, uh, be definitely a step backward, backward, in our efforts to, uh, correct this problem. %$* 5
thank you. %$* 5
one minute— %$* 0
—as was mentioned earlier is drawing, um, the opposing side, drawing, drawing analogies and conclusions, with things that really are not, uh, are not comparable. %$* 5

i feel like we’re making progress and a vote in favor of this motion would, would, uh, be definitely a step backward, backward, in our efforts to, uh, correct this problem. %$* 5
thank you. %$* 5
dale murphy, thank you. %$* 0
now as the format indicates before we hear from julian and from george, i’ll direct, uh, a question of my own toward either side of the debate. %$* 0
dick pound, you have stated that there are obvious health risks to the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” use of performance-enhancing drugs, steroids in particular. %$* 0
are those health risks truly obvious. %$* 0
i—i think they are too anybody who’s, who’s studied these, uh, issues, and, and i think it—they’re obvious to, uh, the folks that have had to deal with, uh, badly damaged or dead athletes. %$* 3
if you take cycling as an example they, there, there’ve been dozens and dozens and dozens of, of, of young men who’ve had heart attacks. %$* 3
they’ve had heart attacks because their hearts can’t pump the sludge that their blood has become, uh, as a result of %$* 3
doctor— %$* 0
so yes, there are real dangers— %$* 3
dr. %$* 0
fost points out that, there have been more players killed, one at the major league level and many at the amateur level, playing baseball, than have been killed because of steroid use as baseball players. %$* 0
and many more killed or seriously injured playing football, which is incidental to playing the sport, than %$* 0
we’re able to determine have suffered serious health consequences because of steroid use, how would you respond to that? %$* 0
yes— %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” me still? %$* 3
i—i would say that the, part of the difficulty with this is, is collecting data, both his and, and other data, because, for many years, all of this use has been clandestine, and hidden. %$* 3
and so you don’t have the, the, the, the data that are, uh, as accurate or as complete as you’d like. %$* 3
radley balko, uh, you are advocating a live-and-let-live approach to this. %$* 0
isn’t it a reasonable response to that to say, fine, that’s one argument for a different day about society in general. %$* 0
but all sports have rules which regulate the competition. %$* 0
no one can stop me in my back yard from using an aluminum bat if i wanna play a game of my own. %$* 0
but they can in a major league game. %$* 0
cork and saliva are perfectly natural and legal substances but not in the context of major league baseball. %$* 0
so why are these— why are these things analogous. %$* 0
well, i—i agree, um, i think we’re—what we’re debating tonight is what the rules ought to be, um, i’m not advocating, uh, uh, i’m not defending the people who have been caught cheating, i think, uh, i think mr. %$* 4
pound is right, when you enter into a league and you agree to, to compete, uh, you agree to a predetermined set of rules. %$* 4
um, but i think tonight what we’re trying to determine is, is what those rules ought to be. %$* 4
um, and i think that, you know, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” i think that athletes, uh, care about their bodies and they care about their, their earning potential. %$* 4
uh, they care about the next season, and i think they are going to seek out a competitive advantage, but they’re not going to do so to the point where, they jeopardize future earning potential or they jeopardize the next season. %$* 4
i think, i think people, uh, have, i think athletes have a little bit, uh, more respect for their bodies than that. %$* 4
although you’re probably aware that there have been surveys of olympic athletes who have been asked the question, if it would guarantee a gold medal, would you reduce your life expectancy by 20 years to get it. %$* 0
you’re dealing with people who are in their late teens to %$* 0
early twenties in many cases, they have a certain sense of vulnerability, a reduced lifespan from 80 to 60 may seem somewhere in the distant future. %$* 0
a huge percentage of them answer yes. %$* 0
well, i mean and if, if the, you know, us olympic committee wants to, to, uh, set those rules, uh, you know, i, i, i think there are important distinctions to be drawn, uh, uh, between amateur athletics and professional athletics but, uh, you know, i—i think, uh, a couple ones, i think %$* 4
first of all i think, private leagues and private sports, uh, professional sports organizations should be able to set their own rules, i’m not advocating, uh, that the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” congress mandate to the, the nfl that they have to allow performance-enhancing drugs. %$* 4
uh, but i also think, don’t think that it’s any business of congress telling leagues that they’re— they have to ban them as well, uh, i think that, uh, uh, the league should be able to set their own rules and i think the people will, uh, athletes will, will, uh %$* 4
lobby to get the rules that both reflect their desire to get a competitive advantage but also protect their health. %$* 4
all right, now let’s, uh, return to the formal presentations, and, uh %$* 0
presenting his viewpoint for the motion, julian savulescu. %$* 0
the finest, uh, italian cyclist, fausto coppi was once asked, and winner of the tour de france was once asked, uh %$* 6
how often had he taken la bamba, or amphetamines during his career, he said, only when absolutely necessary. %$* 6
and when asked precisely how often that was he said, almost always. %$* 6
another tour de france, jacques anquetil in a debate with a french politician said, what do you expect us to do, ride the tour on mineral water? %$* 6
where our team agrees with, uh, dick pound and, and, uh, the opposition is that this is really only the tip of the iceberg. %$* 6
the war on drugs has failed, drugs have always been present in sport, and we’re only seeing probably less than 5 percent of the drug-takers being caught. %$* 6
not only has it failed, it the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” must fail. %$* 6
growth hormone is extremely difficult to detect, blood doping is also extremely difficult to detect, and in the future we’ll have gene doping. %$* 6
insulin-like growth factor can be injected into muscles, to improve muscular strength, it would have to be detected with a muscle biopsy. %$* 6
uh, science has created super- mice capable of running six, uh, kilometers instead of 200 meters, by altering their glucose metabolism. %$* 6
they’ve created schwarzenegger mice with vastly stronger muscles and marathon mice capable of running much faster marathons, these could all be done in humans. %$* 6
we will not be able to detect these changes. %$* 6
not only is the war on drugs bound to fail, uh, it also has other adverse effects, it reduces interest, this year, uh, in the tour de france the race leader michael rasmussen, was, uh, sacked by his team on allegations of taking drugs. %$* 6
there’s always a cloud over winners, of whether they’re taking drugs or not. %$* 6
it’s unfair, the honest athletes are penalized because they’re denied access to safe performance enhancers and of course the rich can buy the undetectable enhancers. %$* 6
they can buy hypoxic air tents for 7000 us dollars which are legal, whereas epo, which is banned, costs only 120 us dollars a month. %$* 6
but most of all it’s unsafe. %$* 6
what happens is there’s pressure to develop undetectable performance enhancers with no eye to the safety. %$* 6
the balco scandal illustrates what a back yard situation we have at the moment. %$* 6
what is policy and the current zero-tolerance approach the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” to drugs in sport, is inconsistent and confused. %$* 6
external technologies like hypoxic air tents, or altitude training, are acceptable, they raise the red blood cell level, yet if we do this directly by retransfusing our own blood, blood doping, or using epo, a natural hormone, that’s illegal. %$* 6
yet they all have exactly the same effect. %$* 6
some enhancers have been permitted in sport. %$* 6
caffeine increases the time to exhaustion, or reduces the time, uh, increases the time to exhaustion by 20 percent. %$* 6
it used to be illegal, athletes were stripped of their medals for taking caffeine, it’s now legal, and it hasn’t corrupted the spirit of sport, it hasn’t had the effect of creating violent mutant gladiators, as the opposition has suggested. %$* 6
creatine also increase the time to exhaustion by 10 percent, it’s also legal. %$* 6
tour de france riders use intravenous nutrition to give them enough calories, uh, overnight, and of course tiger woods has used lasik eye surgery to give him better than 20/20 vision. %$* 6
none of these have had adverse effect on sport. %$* 6
one of the major arguments is that it’s against the spirit and integrity of sport, dick pound wrote—raised this issue. %$* 6
when dick pound was asked in an interview with the new york times which performance enhancements he thought were against the spirit of sport he said, it’s like pornography. %$* 6
you know it when you see it. %$* 6
well of course d.h.lawrence’s novels were thought to be pornographic a century ago, they’re not now. %$* 6
professional classical musicians regularly take beta blockers to the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” reduce, trim and enhance their performance. %$* 6
the music sounds good, it’s not against the spirit of music. %$* 6
the spirit of sport is entailed in what sport is, it’s the display of human physical excellence. %$* 6
indeed, just as we can increase the artistic expression through the use of beta blockers to enhance musical performance we could use them to enhance performance in archery, or indeed, in many, uh, sports requiring control of anxiety. %$* 6
ben johnson famously said, the human body was not meant to run at the speeds it’s asked to run today. %$* 6
to recover from the grueling training necessary to run those times you need steroids to increa—increase recovery. %$* 6
and of course, tiger woods has used lasik eye surgery, and that hasn’t been seen to compromise the spirit of golf. %$* 6
to say that we should reduce %$* 6
drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability. %$* 6
so our proposal, is that we allow a modest approach. %$* 6
we allow performance enhancers which are safe, and consistent with the risks that athletes already entail. %$* 6
you’ll notice that dick bou— dick pound has had to reel out examples from the ‘60s of deaths from steroids, when they were taken orally. %$* 6
and indeed the blood doping deaths all occurred in the ‘90s before the international cycling union set a maximum hem—hematocrit of 50 percent. %$* 6
no athlete today is dying in competition from taking the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” epo.indeed i would prefer to take growth hormone prescribed by a doctor, than compete in professional american football, because i know of no ventilator-dependent quadriplegic caused by taking growth hormone. %$* 6
the drugs need to be consistent with the spirit of an activity, creating webbed hands and feet, which is possible, which is possible, would compromise the spirit of spearing— swimming. %$* 6
but allowing athletes to recover from injuries consistent of sport. %$* 6
we should set limits, as the international cycling union has done, on the hermatocrit %$* 6
and test health, not test for drugs. %$* 6
it makes no difference whether an athlete’s hermatocrit goes from 46 to 48 percent, by altitude training or by taking epo or blood doping. %$* 6
it’s a waste of time trying to detect %$* 6
drugs in sport, far from being against the sport, embodies the human spirit. %$* 6
we are not horses or dogs, flogged to display our maximum biological potential, the spirit of being human, is to make choices. %$* 6
to be human is to be better. %$* 6
to make, to make choices, and performance enhancement as we’ve argued per se is not against the spirit of sport, it embodies the history and spirit of sport. %$* 6
it’s true that cheating is ruining sport. %$* 6
but there are two ways to reduce cheating. %$* 6
one is to ramp up the war on the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” drugs which is bound to fail, the other is to change the rule, the rules to allow regulated, supervised access. %$* 6
we agree that you should hear—adhere to the rules. %$* 6
but the rules will provide a better spectacle, protect the athlete’s health, narrow the gap between the cheaters and the honest athletes, if we allow access to safe performance enhancers. %$* 6
one of the greatest advantages of allowing, uh, the, the access— %$* 6
—the access to performance enhancement is the, the limited funds that are used by what are $22 million, could be better devoted to detecting those drugs which are seriously against athletes’ health, rather than wasting time on substances that do not harm their health, and are actually already a part of the sport. %$* 6

do you wear ‘em? %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” uh, they’d be too big for me. %$* 0
i gotta give mine away, it kills me that he had to be on anabolic steroids but that’s another story, the reason i’m here tonight, is that i’ve talked to a lot of these athletes, i’ve spent the last %$* 7
i guess since i first talked to rich pound almost, almost six weeks talking to athletes %$* 7
and trainers, and they all say the same thing. %$* 7
don’t use my name. %$* 7
don’t use my name. %$* 7
so i’ll avoid the names but there are a couple things we need to know. %$* 7
number one, the rules of the game say that steroids and for good reason, performance-enhancing drugs are absolutely illegal. %$* 7
cheating is cheating and you can’t change it, you can do it any way you want with any documentary but you can’t change it. %$* 7
steroids however you have to know this. %$* 7
they will make you faster, they will make you stronger, and they make help you look and feel and be younger. %$* 7
that’s a lot of attraction. %$* 7
steroids will make you wealthy. %$* 7
steroids will make you famous. %$* 7
steroids will help you get success and if you don’t believe it, look at some of the guys that hold the records. %$* 7
during the course of my preparation i talked to a hall of famer. %$* 7
i said let me ask you something. %$* 7
i said with the steroids, you didn’t have ‘em when you were playing. %$* 7
what if there were steroids now. %$* 7
and he said if it got me back on the field, regardless of the penalty, i’d do it. %$* 7
i thought man, hall the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” of famer, you wanna play—he said you don’t know what it’s like, not to be able to excel at the game anymore. %$* 7
said steroids are the greatest attraction, it’s like walking on the beach with no one around, you and a beautiful girl. %$* 7
you know what’s gonna happen. %$* 7
said, well. %$* 7
i had to tell my wife, i can’t talk about that one. %$* 7
however %$* 7
even though there is no clinical proof, let me repeat, there is no clinical proof that steroids directly lead to death, there are certain guys have suffered something, now, lyle alzado was mentioned. %$* 7
lyle alzado is— as—alzado is not a name to me. %$* 7
i knew him, i interviewed him, i liked him. %$* 7
thought he was crazy, but that’s why we got along. %$* 7
lyle alzado %$* 7
this is what’s not commonly discussed, when he was a freshman in college, weighed 190 pounds. %$* 7
when he graduated as a senior and he started steroids in 1969 as a freshman. %$* 7
when he graduated it was 300-pound muscle mass. %$* 7
that’s a gain of 110 pounds, and you knew he was going big in the nfl draft. %$* 7
went on to become the nfl defensive player of the year in 1977.couple of weeks before he died he said, damn, if i’d never done steroids and human growth hormone, i wouldn’t be dying today. %$* 7
he died, at the age of 43.43 years old. %$* 7
ken caminiti. %$* 7
he’s a third baseman for the padres, it’s spring of 1996.he’s chasing a fly ball, he goes out, he dives. %$* 7
he tears his rotator cuff. %$* 7
ken caminiti was a good guy, a tough guy, a bull of a guy. %$* 7
he said i gotta get well, so he played even though he was in great pain. %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” said ken. %$* 7
go down to tijuana, get you some anabolic steroids, you’ll be back on the field better than ever. %$* 7
so he did. %$* 7
in the year 1996 when he got hooked on steroids and didn’t just do cycles, but did double cycles, so don’t tell me we’re gonna monitor it. %$* 7
ain’t nobody gonna monitor it. %$* 7
he used so much steroids, that he became a giant of a man, he was bulging, ken caminiti went from hitting .282, to hitting .330.he went from 23 home runs to 40 home runs, he had 130 rbi’s, he made millions on a free-agent contract, and, he was absolutely hooked, he said, the more i used the more i had to use, because if i didn’t use i felt like i was going on the field naked. %$* 7
nobody wants to walk out on a field naked. %$* 7
but that’s how he felt. %$* 7
‘cause he said, i was hooked. %$* 7
he was the mvp of baseball in 1996.eight years later he was dead, at the age of 40.but, there’s no clinical proof that steroids led to his death. %$* 7
even though, he was an ala—anabolic steroid type free. %$* 7
if any of you are yankee fans, think back to 1999.the yankees win the world series. %$* 7
they have a relief pitcher you may or may not have heard of named dan naulty. %$* 7
you ever heard of him, bob? %$* 7
dan naulty pitched for the twins then became with the yanks. %$* 7
now follow this, in 1992 don naulty was six foot eight, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” he’s a strapping right-hander, he weighs only 165 pounds. %$* 7
guy said to him, don, you gotta get on some steroids, man, you put some body on you. %$* 7
so he did. %$* 7
in 1999 he was with the yankees, he weighed 245 pounds. %$* 7
that’s a weight gain of 60 pounds. %$* 7
and it was all muscle. %$* 7
unfortunately he described himself as being suicidal, he said, “i was absolutely nutso.” now he didn’t die, he survived. %$* 7
but he had to have major surgery because his veins were clotted against his arteries. %$* 7
he had to have major surgery because he tore the muscle right off—the, the muscle and the groin completely off the bone. %$* 7
dr. %$* 7
james andrews, a man i consider to be one of the foremost absolutely best surgeons of all. %$* 7
he said—he’s a north—noted orthopedic surgeon, he said that %$* 7
now check this out. %$* 7
that in 2002, 17 percent %$* 7
17 percent of total baseball payroll went to guys who were on the injured list with muscle tears, muscle strains, ruptured achilles tendon, and on goes the list. %$* 7
he said that we have had a 200 percent increase in just the five years prior to 2002.baseball owners paid $370 million to players who were not able to play. %$* 7
most of them accord9ing to dr. %$* 7
andrews, were related to their use of anabolic steroids. %$* 7
and you now wanna admit—legalize it, and govern it? %$* 7
no definitive clinical proof though, that it was the result of steroids. %$* 7
no proof. %$* 7
i’m probably the only guy in the room who is friends with professional wrestlers, i started in 1980 with bob backlund. %$* 7
i’ve mc’d a lot of their events, i’ve enjoyed ‘em, i love the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” ‘em. %$* 7
guys that are just names to you like hulk hogan, ricky steamboat, nature boy, rick flair, these are all friends of mine. %$* 7
i wanted to call and check with some of the wrestlers— %$* 7
—i used to know, how they’re doing today. %$* 7
how’d they recover after the use of steroids. %$* 7
i went to call ‘em and you know what i found? %$* 7
of the wrestlers who were professional stars, 40 were dead by the age of 40.70 were dead by the age of 50.but there’s no clinical proof that they died of steroid abuse even though they all used steroids. %$* 7
here’s the bottom line. %$* 7
i am not willing to pay the price for legalizing steroids and performance-enhancing drugs, ‘cause i’ve seen too often what it can do. %$* 7
i don’t wanna go to the cemetery and tell all the athletes who are dead there, hey guys, soon you’ll have a lot more of your friends coming, because we’re gonna legalize this stuff. %$* 7
the only good news out of it? %$* 7
they wouldn’t hear the news. %$* 7
because they’re all dead. %$* 7
thank you. %$* 7
yes. %$* 0

of the wrestlers who were professional stars, 40 were dead by the age of 40.70 were dead by the age of 50.but there’s no clinical proof that they died of steroid abuse even though they all used steroids. %$* 7

they wouldn’t hear the news. %$* 7
because they’re all dead. %$* 7
thank you. %$* 7
our thanks to george michael, and again, according to the format i’ll pose a question to each side of the table. %$* 0
dr. %$* 0
fost, if there were unfettered access to performance-enhancing drugs, isn’t it the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” reasonable to posit that, even now, or even during the so-called steroid era, there were some constraints, some fear of being, uh, caught, there were some tests, however flawed— but if it’s all wide open, it would go beyond any levels we’ve seen heretofore, and could possibly, get into an area where not only would the competition be grotesque, but where there would be real and verifiable health risks. %$* 0
nobody knows but my guess is it would be exactly the opposite. %$* 2
why. %$* 0
because if athletes could go to doctors and get drugs without having to go to mexico or to balco labs, they could a, get drugs which had been studied and tested and approved by the fda, they’d know what they were taking. %$* 2
they could get drugs that would be manufactured in an american manufacturing facility with oversight by the fda, and they’d be getting advice from doctors on which drugs were safe and effe— effective, which now they can’t find out even if they want to because the stuff comes from mexico. %$* 2
all right, suppose we were to adopt julian’s suggestion, that there were regulated, permissible regulated use of performance- the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” enhancing drugs, and in each case it was appropriate to the spirit of the particular sport, that’s fine in the ideal. %$* 0
but it’s naïve to believe that each competitor, many of them obsessed with victory and believing in the full bloom of youth that they’re invulnerable, would stay within those limits, once there were unfettered access, they could just take as much as they wanted to gain whatever short-term competitive advantage they wanted, couldn’t they? %$* 0
uh, whatever a doctor would prescribe to them and probably some would go outside the system as they do now— %$* 2
well couldn’t they get more than the doctor prescribed, people do that all the time now with hgh, there’s a certain amount you can prescribe plausibly for certain conditions, even for anti-aging purpose, and people just double it, triple it, quadruple it, to whatever level they want, right? %$* 0
yeah, that’s what they’re doing now, the difference is that you’d have drugs which could be tested, you’d have follow-up studies so that they would know what the facts are. %$* 2
you’d know whether any of these deaths that george michael refers to have anything to do with steroids. %$* 2
as he said, there’s no evidence that they do. %$* 2
but there are other adverse effects of steroids that i would worry about, but we’ll never find out about them, because we can't the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” study them. %$* 2
so, i think athletes might be more constrained from using them if there was more data out there that they could know about. %$* 2
anybody else on this side of the table want to add anything to that, or respond? %$* 0
can i? %$* 6
julian. %$* 0
so what, if this is the honest athlete, and this is the cheater, at the moment the cheater has a significant advantage. %$* 6
part of this will be heard on radio. %$* 0
so julian is holding his left arm at a certain level and his right arm above it. %$* 0
so, so what will happen if you allow access to safe performance enhancers is the honest athletes will come up, but of course the cheaters will still take, as you suggest, an advantage in the black market. %$* 6
but what you will be doing is narrowing the advantage that the cheater has, because now there’s a market for safe performance enhancement. %$* 6
so you’ve made the honest athletes better off by bringing them closer to the cheaters without the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” compromising their health. %$* 6
that's the reason why you want to create a market for safe performance enhancers. %$* 6
so growth hormone, we heard all this discussion about steroids, growth hormone is a very safe substance. %$* 6
now, you may be able to achieve a lot of the benefits that you can achieve with steroids by using growth, growth hormone. %$* 6
and you’ll be developing new substances that will be competitors for, at the moment, the stuff that, that is simply on the black market. %$* 6
george? %$* 0
julian. %$* 7
would you hear what you just said! %$* 7
if i don’t want to do drugs, i can't play against you. %$* 7
if you don’t want to take the risks of a spinal cord injury, you can't play professional football. %$* 6
no, come on, say with the drugs— %$* 7
no, no, no— %$* 6
george, george, there’s a, for three years in the nfl there’s a ninety percent chance of permanent disability. %$* 2
if you want to play in the nfl, that’s what you buy into. %$* 2
people choose to do it %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 2
how do you, how do you define permanent disability? %$* 0
i'm talking about anabolic steroids. %$* 7
i'm talking about %$* 2
there’s a ninety percent chance of permanent disability. %$* 2
people make that choice. %$* 2
you want to, you want to ban professional football because— %$* 2
no, but you play within the rules, and if you get hurt, as bob says, that’s an unfortunate accident. %$* 7
but the reason you want these rules is because you're concerned about the health and safety of the athletes. %$* 2
why aren't you against football? %$* 2
a question that can be posed later in the debate when the format actually calls for direct questions from either side of the table. %$* 0
here, one more question to this side, and then we’ll announce the results of the preliminary voting by the audience. %$* 0
i’ll pose it to dick pound, but again, dale and george can respond as well. %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” dick, after all your years with the olympics and with wada, are you troubled by the fact that despite best efforts, the penalties are almost by definition disproportionate? %$* 0
you catch a handful, and we can reasonably assume that a larger group goes free. %$* 0
marion jones was never caught by olympic testing, sophisticated as it was. %$* 0
she was caught by the legal system. %$* 0
and the same year that ben johnson was caught, others had statistical anomalies in their performances, and for whatever reason, they were not caught. %$* 0
does that trouble you? %$* 0
oh, sure it does, of course it does. %$* 3
any time you see somebody who’s cheated and gets away with it, that's very troubling. %$* 3
it’s one of the reasons why, why in wada we devote, i think it’s about twenty-five percent of our entire budget to scientific research, so we can, we can find epo, we can find hgh, we can find, uh, evidence of blood transfusions. %$* 3
and we’re developing a test that is not a muscle biopsy, for genetic manipulation. %$* 3
we’re getting a screening test that i think will be able to detect the stuff very unobtrusively by the time it comes on. %$* 3
so yes it, of course it bothers us, but you don’t, you don’t go in the direction julian’s suggesting, which is, you pick the lowest common denominator, help the guys who want to play honestly catch up with the cheaters, instead of bringing the cheaters back down to where, what they promised to do, which is not to use these things. %$* 3
i the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” think it’s a complete reversal of responsibility and approach. %$* 3
dale? %$* 0
george? %$* 0
anything to add? %$* 0
yeah, i was, i was going to say, as i said earlier, if, if i didn’t think we were making progress, and that this is a winnable battle, however long it takes, um, then i would understand giving in. %$* 7
but i, i can't, i can't comprehend just giving up. %$* 7
um, those who are against smoking in public have stayed with it, have stayed with it, and have stayed with it. %$* 7
and it has worked. %$* 7
and we can change culture, we can change the way people feel about things. %$* 7
and, and this is a battle about fighting, instead of just giving in. %$* 7
here, here’s a reason to think this battle is unwinnable. %$* 6
given the massive prize money, and the incentives to cheat, and the low probability of being detected, you can win the battle if you reduce the prize money, but that’s not going to happen. %$* 6
all you can, unrealistically, increase the detection rates, but you're not going to achieve that either. %$* 6
the economic models all push this into a prisoner’s dilemma where people irresistibly will cheat given the incentives that are on offer, and the probability to— %$* 6
how many, how many rich canoeists do you know? %$* 3
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 3
i'm sorry? %$* 6
how many rich canoeists do you know? %$* 3
who many rich canoeists do you know? %$* 0
it’s not, it’s not— %$* 6
it’s just money, i agree that it’s— %$* 3
there’s a whole array of, a whole array of olympic sports, obviously that have little or not financial reward attached to them. %$* 0
mr. %$* 7
balko, let me, let me make one quick point. %$* 7
you took, took on the horse industry, i’ve been named the top american paint horse breeder, and the american quarterhorse breeder twice. %$* 7
so, i’ve had a lot of horses in my barn, a hundred and fifty at a time. %$* 7
we’ve never used a sweat box. %$* 7
ever. %$* 7
i will not allow steroids. %$* 7
ever. %$* 7
when you talk about the horse industry, and you know how we get horses ready for shows or race, make it real general that some people do, because i would never do it. %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” all right, we’re going far afield here, so— %$* 0
so what? %$* 7
briefly— %$* 0
it involves steroids. %$* 7
briefly radley, and then i’ll try and get back to the format. %$* 0
go ahead. %$* 0
i was referring to, there was a cover story on sports, in cover, sports illustrated a couple of years ago about the lengths that jockeys go through to, to make weight. %$* 4
oh, the jockeys, ok. %$* 7
right, the jockeys, not the horses. %$* 4
ok. %$* 0
you want to get back to your format? %$* 7
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” yeah, we have to get back to the format because, uh, they, they threaten me with draconian punishments if i, uh, went too far afield. %$* 0
so, what we do at this point, before opening it up to, uh, some back and forth between the panelists, and then ultimately to a long session of q&a, most of it from the audience, we let you know the results of the initial balloting. %$* 0
now, this is before any of the debaters took to the podium, the proposition is, we should accept performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports. %$* 0
before the debate began eighteen percent of you were for the motion, sixty-three percent were against, nineteen percent were undecided. %$* 0
you’ll have a chance to vote again after the debate has concluded, and we’ll see if those numbers move in one direction or the other. %$* 0
now we’ll allow the panelists to question each other directly. %$* 0
norm fost will go first, and you can ask a direct question of any panelist on the other side of the table. %$* 0
i'm going to try to squeeze in two, two questions, if i can. %$* 2
uh, i want to ask dale murphy a question. %$* 2
andy petitte, the yankee pitcher who recently, he was named in the mitchell report, and he admitted to using, um, growth hormone. %$* 2
and he said the reason i used it was because i had injuries, the my doctor said my injuries could heal faster, um, which is true, that’s the way these things work, they let you to repair injuries faster so you can the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” train harder and get back on the field. %$* 2
if roger clemens said that, if ben johnson said that, if they all said that, which they equally could have said, i used them because they help me heal faster, would that have been, are you ok with what petitte said, and would you be ok with them? %$* 2
and i want to ask— %$* 2
let’s, let’s let him ask, answer that first, then you ask your second question. %$* 0
dale? %$* 0
yeah, absolutely not, it’s, it’s still trying to get an advantage over the guys that are not taking human growth hormone to recover from an injury. %$* 5
that’s why guys take steroids. %$* 5
it’s not necessarily to look like barry bonds, but it’s to recover quicker. %$* 5
pitchers, that’s why pitchers take them. %$* 5
um, so i think in answer to your question, it would not be as big a story. %$* 5
andy petitte was smart. %$* 5
but is it still right? %$* 5
no. %$* 5
it’s still not within the rules and the spirit of the game to take steroids or human growth hormone to recover from an injury quicker, because a lot of guys are following the rules, and they don’t get to recover faster because they, they kept the rules. %$* 5
so it’s still wrong. %$* 5
i think he had a good p.r.agent and lawyer to say this is how you get it off your back. %$* 5
it doesn't make it right. %$* 5
but, but we’re talking about what the rules should be, and, and the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” i'm interested, as a former player, of your opinion, if, if it’s true, that the side effects of hgh are minimal, particularly when compared to steroids, and it does help, i mean, these are people, athletes are people whose livelihoods depends on, on basically what amounts to physical labor, right? %$* 4
and if a guy can, uh, get back into the game quicker because of hgh, is that any different than a, you know, a construction worker who wants to get back on the job quicker because his pay check is dependent on it, taking something, a drug that has minimal effects that helps him recover quicker? %$* 4
reasonable question, let me focus it a little bit. %$* 0
um, are we in a pass/fail mindset about the whole array of performance enhancing drugs, especially after the mitchell report, if we talk about baseball, where if you're in the mitchell report, you're guilty, no matter what you did, you're as guilty as the most full blown juicer. %$* 0
and should even those who were generally against the use of performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports, should they consider that possibly we’ve lumped all these drugs and all the circumstances under which they might be used into the same grouping, and we might be able to take a more nuanced approached, and that maybe using hgh short term to help rehab an injury is not the same thing as going steroids full blown and going from a one hundred sixty pound whippet who hits twenty the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” home runs to some sort of gargantuan figure who hits seventy- three? %$* 0
are you referring to barry bonds? %$* 7
it was just a number. %$* 0
i retired, i retired— %$* 5
he hit seven sixty-two. %$* 0
i retired at, at thirty-seven, barry bonds hit seventy-three home runs at thirty-seven. %$* 5
um, you know, what, what’s the future hold? %$* 5
i mean, it, do, does it help you heal quicker? %$* 5
yeah, that's why guys take them. %$* 5
but do we need them? %$* 5
no. %$* 5
you're going to heal a little slower. %$* 5
isn't that— %$* 8
i mean, you're going to, let’s, let’s stop the abuse of a controlled substance. %$* 5
human growth hormone for kids helps them grow when they're not producing enough of their own. %$* 5
that's a legitimate use for it. %$* 5
but for a, a pitcher to get back quicker, to me, in sports, you're going to get back a little later. %$* 5
it’s ok.i the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” want to stop the abuse. %$* 5
and i think to allow any of it in, for whatever reason, increases the odds of abuse, and increases, again, the kids seeing the example that they have to take this stuff to succeed. %$* 5
it just isn't needed. %$* 5
it’s not needed— %$* 5
in the, in the interests of time, norm, quickly your second question. %$* 0
well just first, as a doctor, i don’t understand what medicine’s about if it’s not about trying to help people recover from injuries and heal, and if you're— %$* 2
but not to hit home runs. %$* 5
and if you have a, if you have a drug that doesn't, has almost no side effects, and it helps people heal, i don’t know how it differs from anything else that— %$* 2
your question. %$* 0
second one, dick pound, um, a lot of the discussion here has been about fair competition. %$* 2
um, knowing that janet evans used a greasy swimsuit that was not available to her opponents, did you speak out at the time against that? %$* 2
would you speak out the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” against it now? %$* 2
do you think her medal should be taken back? %$* 2
and if not, why not? %$* 2
dick? %$* 0
i, i think you’ve got a, a completely bizarre perception of the difference between ben johnson and janet evans. %$* 3
i mean, ben johnson used a prohibited anabolic steroid. %$* 3
there was a rule against it. %$* 3
there was no rule about whether you could have nylon swimsuits or greasy swimsuits. %$* 3
do you think it was fair? %$* 2
i think it was, i don’t think it was, uh, i don’t think that’s the question here. %$* 3
did she break %$* 3
what if she practiced harder? %$* 3
i mean, frankly, i, i greatly admire janet evans, i think she won the olympics because she trained harder and was a better swimmer than everybody. %$* 3
i don't think the swimsuit made any difference, and there’s been subsequent tests on all of these suits. %$* 3
and the international swimming federation said, wear whatever you want, it does not appreciably, if at all, effect performance. %$* 3
so i think you, you’ve got your, your priorities really mixed up on that question. %$* 3
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” dick, you're right back at the microphone, because it’s your turn in the running order here to pose a question to the other side. %$* 0
well, i was struck by something that both, um, both radley and, and norman said talking about, uh, you know, having access to all of this, and coercive rules. %$* 3
i mean, coercive rules, you're talking, you make it, you make it sound like it’s three guys at the ioc headquarters making up all these rules. %$* 3
the anti-doping rules are approved by two hundred plus companies, two hundred plus national olympic committees, seventy-five or more international federations, athletes commissions from all over the world. %$* 3
it’s a consensus about what is right for sports. %$* 3
and, you know, maybe the question to you is how come all you guys with these fabulous ideas aren't able to persuade two hundred governments and two hundred national— %$* 3
two whom specifically are you directing the question? %$* 0
well, i’ll address it to both, because the other is, not all of the athletes you're talking about will have access to a yale medical doctor. %$* 3
what about the athletes in mexico? %$* 3
in, in bulgaria? %$* 3
i mean, you— the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 3
norm, radley— %$* 0
if you want, you want equal, you want equal playing fields, you're not talking the same. %$* 3
well, what about the athletes who have the funds to travel to colorado springs to train in high altitude versus low income athletes who might not? %$* 4
uh, you know, there, there are built-in advantages and disadvantages. %$* 4
i think actually making a, uh, a cheap, a relatively cheap drug that mimics that effect, like epo, which is much, much cheaper than, you know, flying an athlete out to colorado to, to train at high altitude, um, actually democratizes, uh, that effect. %$* 4
i don’t think it actually, uh, makes it more difficult, uh, to achieve parity. %$* 4
once again, radley, stay at the microphone, because it’s your turn to question the other side. %$* 0
unless norm, you wanted to have a quick response? %$* 0
i just wanted, dick keeps reminding us that these athletes broke the rules, as if we’re not all agreed about that. %$* 2
i didn't know the debate topic was, should athlete be allowed to break the rules. %$* 2
no is the answer. %$* 2
ok, that’s the end of that debate. %$* 2
the the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” question is, why the rules are there. %$* 2
why do we have a rule that prohibits a doctor from prescribing a drug that helps you heal that has no side effects? %$* 2
where did that come from? %$* 2
i haven't heard an answer to that yet. %$* 2
isn't it fair to ask whether you’ve limited the definition of why someone might use steroids? %$* 0
it’s not so high-minded as, it helps you heal. %$* 0
many of the people who undertook taking steroids had no problems. %$* 0
their only problem was they wanted to run faster, grow bigger, hit more home runs. %$* 0
so, there’s no medical indication for that, it’s performance enhancing. %$* 0
that's why we call them performance enhancing drugs. %$* 0
all athletes want to get back out there and work out and get back on the field as soon as possible. %$* 2
you make it sound like they're all on the disabled list. %$* 0
many of them were quite good to begin with, then they, they went from good to super human by using performance enhancing drugs. %$* 0
yeah, what it, what it enables them to do is to train harder and to recover from injury quicker, and that’s why they get better. %$* 2
yeah. %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” i tell you what, i had an experience with medical ethicists a few years ago, and i, i posed a question after the panel. %$* 3
i said, listen, let’s say i'm a track and field athlete. %$* 3
call me ben, not a real name. %$* 3
and i come to you, and i say, listen, i would like to win the olympics in seoul. %$* 3
i can't do this unless i use anabolic steroids. %$* 3
there’s nothing therapeutic about this. %$* 3
and i have to tell you that it’s totally contrary to the rules of the sport under which i compete. %$* 3
would you prescribe the anabolic steroids? %$* 3
and the entire panel of medical ethicists said, of course. %$* 3
and i said, what! %$* 3
and they said, yeah. %$* 3
and i said, on what basis? %$* 3
they said, the autonomy of the patient. %$* 3
sounds like radley. %$* 3
sorry, i didn't hear what— %$* 2
the autonomy of the patient. %$* 3
no, i don’t think— %$* 2
that's, that's what they said. %$* 3
no, i don’t think, for the fifth time, i don't think we should break rules, and i don’t think doctors or ethicists should encourage the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” people to break rules. %$* 2
but uh, if an athlete came, well, i’ve said it, if, if ben johnson, somebody named ben came to me and said, i've got an injury, do you know anything that will help it heal, and it’s risk-less, and there’s no rule against it, um, i’d say, i can't think of any reason not to— %$* 2
and, and what if the person came to you and they didn't want to make up a story, as they might have to, and they said, i have no injury. %$* 0
and i train like a demon. %$* 0
but i’d like to have benefits on top of that, would you prescribe the steroids for them? %$* 0
well, first of all, i'm, i'm not in sports medicine for a reason, so i'm, i'm not into prescribing it. %$* 2
but uh, that athlete would misunderstand it if he thought he, the reason that stops athletes from working out, and why you can't lift weights eight hours a day and five days a week, is because you're suffering recurring injury. %$* 2
they may not understand that. %$* 2
all they know is that they're sore and they can't work out, and that limits their ability to improve their performance. %$* 2
so you believe the sole benefit of steroid use, we’re not talking about hdh, we’re talking about growth steroid use, is simply the ability to work out harder and recover from injury, that in and of themselves, they do not, on top of that, enhance performance and the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” allow you to do something which you could not do, if for some reason you could work out that hard without steroids? %$* 0
bob, if you and i started taking steroids now, we’re not going to look like dale murphy anytime soon— %$* 2
of course not— %$* 0
or barry bonds. %$* 2
uh— %$* 2
you, you can't, you can't win the indy 500 in a honda either, but if you have %$* 0
but if you have indy, if you have two indy cars, and one gets auto fuel and the other gets rocket fuel, you might have a different outcome. %$* 0
as best we know, the, the main way they work is by enabling you to work out harder. %$* 2
steroids without working out are not going to really change anything very much. %$* 2
they do increase your aggressiveness, which also makes you, helps you to work out harder, so they have a psychological effect. %$* 2
but i think it’s all tied to working out. %$* 2
all right, against the rules, i briefly became part of the debate— the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” %$* 0
no! %$* 7
i’ll slap myself on the hand and turn it over to radley to ask a question of the other side. %$* 0
sure, my, uh, question is directed at george. %$* 4
um, let’s say for the sake of argument that the, the names that you mentioned during your presentation did die directly as a result of their using steroids. %$* 4
uh, during alcohol prohibition people drank alcohol that was, uh, wood alcohol, uh, they drank alcohol that was, gin that was distilled in bathtubs, toxic, nasty, nasty stuff. %$* 4
the reason they drank is because safer, cheaper, um, better alternatives weren't available at the time. %$* 4
uh, once prohibition ended, you know, nobody drinks bathtub gin anymore. %$* 4
uh, nobody drinks wood alcohol anymore. %$* 4
um, assuming that all these deaths were tied to steroids, all these deaths occurred during a period where steroids were illegal, and were still prohibited. %$* 4
so, they were prohibited its entire time, people were doing them anyway, why not lift that veil, let people who are going to do it anyway get steroids from, from a doctor, get steroids from more reputable distributors so they don’t have to go to tijuana. %$* 4
maybe it wasn’t steroids itself that killed them, maybe it was the fact that it was some black market steroids that they weren't the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” being, um, advised by a reputable doctor. %$* 4
you're absolutely correct, and maybe, you know, if they were controlled better, maybe lyle alzado wouldn't have died. %$* 7
maybe ken caminiti, who got most of his from tijuana, wouldn't have died. %$* 7
but what about the tight end i talked to a couple of weeks ago who admitted that he gained sixty pounds, this guy is only thirty-eight years old, gained sixty pounds, beat up his wife, went to his coach and said, coach help me, i'm doing the juice, but god, i beat up so and so. %$* 7
i know these people. %$* 7
he didn't get his from mexico. %$* 7
now, i don’t know where he got them. %$* 7
but if, the, if you, if you allow one, if bob can do steroids, if we’re playing side by side, he hits two thirty, i hit two thirty, we both move up to the next level. %$* 7
if he’s allowed to do juice, when i sit back to sitting on the bench in st. %$* 7
louis, i’d have done juice. %$* 7
so that, so whether it’s legal or illegal is, is immaterial. %$* 7
if we make it legal the problem is only going to become worse. %$* 7
in relationship to alcohol, i don’t happen to drink, so i'm not a good one to discuss it with. %$* 7
well, i guess my point is, if we’re talking about the safety of athletes, isn't it better to have this all happening above ground and in the open air— %$* 4
no, it’s better to have it, if you use it, you're out of baseball. %$* 7
it the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” should be a very strong penalty. %$* 7
nothing, pete rose, one thing about the, dick made the point earlier, and dale followed up, they know that if you gamble, you're dead. %$* 7
so that’s the way it should be with steroids, unless the doctor says, you know what, i'm going to go to the commissioner and say, dale needs to have this, so he’ll be able to come back. %$* 7
then i accept that. %$* 7
dale, your question for the other side of the debate? %$* 0
ok, um, dr. %$* 5
fost, you mentioned the increased, uh, intensity of workouts of those on steroids. %$* 5
would you consider that “’roid rage? %$* 5
“’roid rage” as i understand it refers to people who do criminal things, that is who assault people or— %$* 2
ok, but is “’roid rage,” quote, unquote, without getting into the technicalities of what “’roid rage” means, isn't that one of the side effects of taking anabolic steroids? %$* 5
you become more aggressive when you take steroids, and that is one part of why i think some athletes feel they can work out harder, they sort of get more aggressive. %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” they, so is it psychological, or is it a brain chemistry thing? %$* 5
it’s totally psychological? %$* 5
i think there is a psychological effect, right, that impels them to train harder. %$* 2
so, when you increase the testosterone, and, and you increase your intensity, um, isn't that, that is a, an effect, you're saying? %$* 5
that, it will effect you that way? %$* 5
sure, sure. %$* 2
and also are you saying that hgh, the only thing it does is help you heal faster? %$* 5
no, it has many— %$* 2
do you think these guys, in other words, do you think guys took hgh for other reasons other than healing faster? %$* 5
well, they took it so they could get back on the field sooner, could body build better, could lift weights, could train more vigorously, all of which enhanced their muscle mass. %$* 2
that’s the ultimate the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” goal, is to become stronger. %$* 2
ok. %$* 5
decreases fat and, and increase muscle mass. %$* 0
right. %$* 2
so, so the ability to recover faster and work out harder and gain muscle mass, steroids does help muscle mass product, productivity? %$* 5
combined with working out, yeah. %$* 2
and if i don’t want to do that, are you saying in the future, if the motion is accepted, that essentially, i am at a tremendously unfair advantage if i decide that i do not want to take this stuff? %$* 5
i don’t know about tremendously unfair, i think that— %$* 2
well, i would, i would say tremendously unfair. %$* 5
well i don’t— %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” i mean, we can look at numbers, we can look at performances, um— %$* 5
dale, you're exhibit a, i mean, i'm assuming you didn't use any of these drugs, and you're an all-star, and uh, you know, one of the great players of— %$* 2
well doesn't, then doesn't that make my point? %$* 5
you didn't seem to be at very much of an un-, of a disadvantage? %$* 2
but doesn't that make my point that we don’t need them? %$* 5
there’s all sorts of reasons— %$* 2
why, why do we need them if, if people are able to perform at the highest level without them, and that it also provides a huge advantage if you use them, but you can still be a world class athlete, why would we need them? %$* 5
why not ban them and, and change the culture to the point to where guys think a lot time before they take this stuff? %$* 5
why do we need them? %$* 5
well we don’t, we don’t need them, and we don’t need sports the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” either. %$* 2
we don’t need tackle in football, we can play two hand touch, it’s just— %$* 2
yeah, but we’re not talking about— %$* 5
it’s just not as much interest. %$* 2
we’re not talking about football, the people that die, that’s not the argument. %$* 5
the argument isn't the inherent risks of any sports tonight, it’s performance enhancing drugs. %$* 5
you don't need them to be a, a world class athlete. %$* 5
you do not need them. %$* 5
and if you don’t take them, you're at a huge advantage. %$* 5
and so i, i just, i cannot understand it. %$* 5
wouldn't you agree, one last question, that the example that the young people see, wouldn't you say that abuse of these kind of drugs is particularly, we talk about side effects, wouldn't you agree that it’s particularly, um, harmful to young people, that we may not even know abuse of these kind of drugs— %$* 5
again, let me— %$* 0
what may happen. %$* 5
let me slightly redirect it, would you agree, dr. %$* 0
fost, with the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” superior medical knowledge, would you agree that there are risks for adolescents that are not present, at least to the same degree, and you might argue at all, for adults? %$* 0
absolutely, and i said in my remarks that i thought they should be banned in children, there should be testing in children, there ought to be— %$* 2
all right. %$* 0
harsh penalties for suppliers to children— %$* 2
if that’s the case then, isn't it inevitable, if you were to allow unfettered access to performance enhancing drugs beyond a certain threshold of competition and a certain age limit, that those who aspire to play at the collegiate level, and ultimately to play at the professional level, wouldn't just be influenced, they’d be nearly compelled to begin using sooner than you would advocate— %$* 0
no— %$* 2
to get there? %$* 0
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” i don’t think so. %$* 2
first of all they couldn't, wouldn't be able to get them through prescribed channels, they wouldn't be able to get them through illegal channels— %$* 2
plenty of people get them now— %$* 0
and that’s why we need rigorous testing and criminal penalties for those who do it. %$* 2
look, i'm much, it’s interesting how we obsess about this issue, which again, has caused very little serious harm to adolescents, and the ones who do use them, as julian said, are using them mainly to bodybuild, not, they're not being used, for the most part, in uh, competitive sports. %$* 2
most of the adolescent use is in the gyms, not in the playing field. %$* 2
but listen, alcohol kills fifty thousand people a year, and what are the big leagues doing about that. %$* 2
when players drink, i don't hear anybody talking about lifetime bans for drunk driving by baseball players. %$* 2
that kills fifty thousand people a year, including innocent victims, including a lot of kids, and here we are talking about something that kills almost nobody. %$* 2
chewing tobacco is a big problem among youth in this country, and we have the networks showing terry francona drooling every ten seconds during the world series. %$* 2
what kind of— %$* 2
the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” although they have banned it in the minors, and they would ban it at the major league level if they could unilaterally impose it. %$* 0
but they can't— %$* 0
and most seriously of all is the violence by professional athletes. %$* 2
i'm talking about sexual assault, and criminal violence, rampant in professional sports. %$* 2
no lifetime penalty, no ban, do a little community service, and come back. %$* 2
what message does that send— %$* 2
is, isn't that why, to uh, the side of the table that is against the motion, isn't that why the argument against the use of performance enhancing drugs is best focused on competitive issues, the sanctity of the records, uh, the level playing field argument. %$* 0
and if we start moralizing about health dangers, or relative impact on society, then you run up against all the arguments that dr. %$* 0
fost just laid out, and isn't the best argument for this side of the table the argument about competitive balance, or competitive fairness? %$* 0
true, but doctor, remember what dr. %$* 7
james andrews said, that is we have more torn muscles, we have more pulled muscles because we have too much muscle mass for the body, and that’s the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared us debate “performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports” the direct result of steroids and the workouts with steroids. %$* 7
very briefly. %$* 0

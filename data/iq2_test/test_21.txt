no, no, but the thrust of the argument-- %$* 13
and then you can go on for your point-- %$* 13
yeah, sure. %$* 59
the thrust of his argument is that there has been an enormous amount of vetting going on at government levels around the world and that this in itself would act as a safety net, do you refute that, that sort of vetting is going on? %$* 13
i think that there's a lot of review that's going on, and i think that it is focused on the point that i've just made, that there are no acute dramatic effects of the consumption of genetically modified organisms. %$* 59
all of those assessments have left open this notion-- %$* 59
two things, one, that there could be subtle long term effects that we have not identified and that each application of genetic engineering needs to be looked at separately. %$* 59
so, whatever you say about roundup ready crops, that says nothing about these new gene silencing technologies that are right up the way. %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
so, a blanket assertion of safety isn't scientifically justified. %$* 59
alison, van eenennaam, would you like to respond? %$* 13
sure, i mean, as a scientist like i would never make a blanket assertion about safety and i think it's very much dependent on each particular review. %$* 57
but i think that as a scientist i let the data tell me whether there are safety concerns. %$* 57
and after 20 years and thousands of studies and i feel the weight of the thousands of academic colleagues throughout the world that have done these safety studies-- %$* 57
but let's look-- %$* 59
that haven't found unique concerns that i have to accept the evidence for what it is and let the data tell me whether it's safe. %$* 57
margaret mellon. %$* 13
but let's look at data like the kind that you've accumulated in your meta-analysis. %$* 59
you're looking at cows, cows that are killed when they are very young, maybe 14 or 15 months old, and you're drawing from the fact that there haven't been kind of increased condemnation rates at slaughter for cows over a long period of time. %$* 59
wait. %$* 13
can you just back up on the term of art? %$* 13
so looking at cows because they're actually consuming the feed that's-- %$* 13
they're consuming the feed that's-- %$* 59
that is-- %$* 59
and they're opening them up and they're not finding what? %$* 13
well, they're all-- %$* 59
i believe that alison can tell us what she found in her study, but she just looked at the rates of condemnation when-- %$* 59
what's that word? %$* 13
i mean, when you get-- %$* 59
wait, condemnation. %$* 13
what-- %$* 59
you-- %$* 59
if a-- %$* 59
if someone brings an obviously ill carcass to a slaughterhouse-- %$* 59
it can't be sold as meat. %$* 13
right-- %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
they are not going to be allowed to sell it. %$* 59
and if you look at those rates and correlate them with-- %$* 59
you look at them over the time that we've been growing and that animals have been consuming this food, i think that's a valuable study and it tells you something. %$* 59
but it doesn't tell you very much. %$* 59
it certainly doesn't tell you about the effects of these crops even on animals who live a full lifetime. %$* 59
what would tell us? %$* 13
and i want to go to the other side. %$* 13
just so-- %$* 13
- i can give you 10 seconds-- %$* 13
what kind of study would tell us the answer? %$* 13
you need to do long term studies in animals, you need to do them progressively-- %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
and we, in fact, need protocols for how to do the kinds of studies that need to be done. %$* 59
okay, that's 10 seconds. %$* 13
robert fraley. %$* 13
if you look at alison's review, there's over two dozen long term animal studies that point to exactly the same answer, that these products are safe, and that's absolutely a fact. %$* 56
and the same agencies that have reviewed all of this data are the same agencies that have reached the same conclusion on the gravity of science around global warming. %$* 56
you know, you go to the national academy, you go to all of the major organizations, at some point, you know, if-- %$* 56
consensus doesn't mean everybody agrees, it doesn't mean that there's a complete 100 percent alignment just like there isn't on global warming, but the science speaks for itself there, and the science has reached a consensus on this. %$* 56
but, chuck, you said that if you thought that you would go to the other side, that you're not married to your position, that you're married to data, because they're saying they have much more data for their position than you do. %$* 13
a couple of really important points need to be made. %$* 58
the genetically engineered crops on the market today that are being planted by farmers and have been in the last few years are different from the genetically engineered crops that were planted in the early days. %$* 58
rob fraley and his colleagues have brought out a continuing series of improved more effective products. %$* 58
and one of the things that they've done is they've stacked multiple traits into a single corn. %$* 58
one of the big concerns in the scientific community is that the cadillac ge corn that monsanto has developed, it's called, "smartstax," and it actually expresses eight different traits. %$* 58
there's six different bt proteins that are expressed to control different insects and two genes that confer tolerance to glyphosate roundup herbicide and another herbicide called, "glufosinate." well, this mixing of eight different traits in this single genetically engineered corn plant raises some, you know, important scientific concerns, just like when you go to the doctor the doctor's going to ask you what drugs you've been-- %$* 58
what other medications you might be on before prescribing you something else for some other problem you may have. %$* 58
so-- %$* 13
the regulatory agencies, the industry-- %$* 58
no one has done any serious research on the potential problems from these stacked traits that are in today's ge food. %$* 58
alison-- %$* 13
question. %$* 58
alison van eenennaam, is that sort of study called for? %$* 13
in other words, your opponents are saying, "we're getting into so many areas where we've never been before that we should go in a very, very cautious way and try to stay ahead of disaster by figuring out what's dangerous. %$* 13
well, i mean, i guess, as a breeder, we routinely stack traits. %$* 57
we're always selecting for multiple traits going into the-- %$* 57
so, this to you all familiar-- %$* 13
and old hat. %$* 13
it doesn't feel-- %$* 13
that's-- %$* 57
well-- %$* 57
new to you. %$* 13
it's breeding. %$* 57
you're always trying to improve multiple traits. %$* 57
and i think i need to understand the scientific kind of hypothesis, why stacked traits would be more dangerous when the individuals are not separate. %$* 57
i guess it's like looking at a broccolini, and you know broccoli is safe and the other plant that was crossed-- %$* 57
why would a broccolini be more dangerous than its two parents? %$* 57
so, what's your biological basis? %$* 57
the debate isn't about broccolini, it's about gm foods. %$* 58
and i'd like to get back to what robert fraley said about they're accepted around the world. %$* 58
i mean, robert, you know about the problems your sister company, syngenta, has now getting corn shipments into china. %$* 58
in fact, the corn industry is very concerned about the growing rejection of shipments in china and some other countries, because of unapproved traits. %$* 58
and in fact, we've been reading about adm and cargill, two of the largest grain companies in the united states-- %$* 58
have sued syngenta. %$* 58
and there's, like, 50 lawsuits from farmers because of the lost income. %$* 58
so, it's really, i think, disingenuous to suggest that all over the world, all countries have opened their arms to ge crops, when, in fact, the trend-- %$* 58
all right. %$* 13
let's let-- %$* 13
let's let him respond to that. %$* 13
robert fraley. %$* 13
so-- %$* 56
so, the pictures %$* 13
i'd be happy to respond to that, although it's, you know, someone else's product. %$* 56
but i just want to come back to-- %$* 56
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
i want you to stay on point. %$* 13
i want you-- %$* 13
you can come back later. %$* 13
i'll return to it. %$* 56
so, the question-- %$* 56
we got into this-- %$* 56
was-- %$* 56
but robert-- %$* 13
but let me run the debate, okay? %$* 13
i did-- %$* 13
i know you do a great job of it, john. %$* 56
and i will-- %$* 13
but i will come back to you. %$* 13
i will give you a chance to do that. %$* 13
perfect. %$* 56
that'd be-- %$* 56
that'd be great. %$* 56
i just want-- %$* 13
i want t come to the point, because it's right in front of us now, that-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 56
the picture you-- %$* 13
part of the argument you made was that the ready acceptance around the world. %$* 13
and your opponents just stated-- %$* 13
right. %$* 56
so-- %$* 56
okay. %$* 13
not your company, but the product-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 56
so let's talk about it. %$* 56
so, the issue is, to get the products sold in the united states, you get fda, usda, and epa approval. %$* 56
but then you get the import approval from all the countries around the world. %$* 56
syngenta got the approval for every country but china. %$* 56
and china is notoriously slow in their regulatory process. %$* 56
and you know, there may be a little politics involved in this particular case. %$* 56
but they got 38 out of 39 import approvals, and there's one more to go. %$* 56
and i know they've been working really hard to get that approvaland you know, it's unfortunate, when there's a market disruption. %$* 56
but it probably wouldn't surprise folks here to know that there's sometimes a little bit of politics and a little bit of mischief behind the scenes. %$* 56
and that's what's going on here. %$* 56
margaret mellon to respond. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 59
i mean, i think it's very important to note how much hassle-- %$* 59
trade hassle-- %$* 59
is associated with the fact that the u.s. continues to embrace and push genetically- modified food on the rest of the world-- %$* 59
some of whom like it and many of whom don't. %$* 59
in fact, there's, i think, a billion dollars of lost sales as a result of this-- %$* 59
of this trade disruption that we're talking about. %$* 59
but that's just one of many. %$* 59
i mean, there have been contamination incidents of all kinds that have resulted in american crops being turned back. %$* 59
i mean, this is an expensive technology for us to push in today's world. %$* 59
it's amazing to me that the big grain traders, cargill and-- %$* 59
adm. %$* 58
adm, are suing the biotech companies. %$* 59
and they're suing them for huge amounts of money. %$* 59
i mean, this is-- %$* 59
this is serious business to them. %$* 59
they're losing them on a lot of money, and they're frankly not getting much in the way of-- %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
of benefits from the technology. %$* 59
so, i mean, i think it does signal that there is discomfort with technology around the world. %$* 59
some of it may be-- %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
political, but it's sure %$* 59
margaret, i'm going to stop you there, because point made. %$* 13
robert, i did say i'd let you come back to your point. %$* 13
so, it's your time. %$* 13
sure. %$* 56
so, just, you know, you said a lot about trade. %$* 56
let me just make the point. %$* 56
60 percent of the u.s.corn gets exported around the world and a third of our soybeans to markets that accept these products. %$* 56
we are the breadbasket to the world. %$* 56
it's unfortunate when there's a disruption, but it's been really minor against the context of the benefits that these products have provided for food security. %$* 56
the point i was trying to make on the safety studies is each of these genes is regulated, individually looked at, and they are also looked at collectively, and there is no reason to believe that they have any concern in terms of stacking them together. %$* 56
in fact, chuck, i remember one of the first times we met. %$* 56
you actually reminded me that the best way to bring this technology into the marketplace was to bring multiple products together so we had more durability and better insect protection. %$* 56
in so many cases, the industry's done exactly what you've said. %$* 56
yes, that-- %$* 58
that's true. %$* 58
i mean, we-- %$* 58
so, to have six different bt proteins in corn, the idea kind of goes back to the frank sinatra song, you know, if the right one don't get you, then the left one will. %$* 58
but the problem is we know that insects, they-- %$* 58
they have the ability-- %$* 58
once they develop resistance to one bt protein, it becomes much easier and quicker to develop resistance to others. %$* 58
and we now know, both in cotton insects and in corn insects, we've got corn root worms out there resistant to three of the six bt proteins in his corn already, and it's only been on the market for four years. %$* 58
so while having multiple bt proteins in there sort of sounds like a good idea, it's already not playing out as planned. %$* 58
and think about it. %$* 58
on an acre of corn, the six different bt proteins add up to 3.7 pounds of the bioinsecticide that's inside that corn. %$* 58
and that is allowing farmers to not use a tenth or perhaps 2/10 of a pound of a soil insecticide. %$* 58
so, how do you reduce pesticide use if you're replacing 2/10 of a pound-- %$* 58
okay. %$* 13
with 3.7 pounds. %$* 58
so you moved to where i wanted to go next, which is into the effect on the environment. %$* 13
so we've discussed safety. %$* 13
everybody said what i think they're going to say on it, and there's a bit of an impasse. %$* 13
but the impact on the environment. %$* 13
and alison van eenennaam, your opponents have said that in fact after getting off to a good start, in a sense, the big success story of roundup ready wheat and bt corn have somewhat backfired and that their impact on the environment has become to be a negative because they led to the use of-- %$* 13
as you-- %$* 13
weeds resistant to-- %$* 13
to herbicide and to pesticides and more spring as a result. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, i mean, again, i think you've got to look at the application and what the actual product is. %$* 57
and i think it's that the effective of bt crops has been a dramatic reduction in insecticide use, especially in the developing world. %$* 57
and, i mean, i stated the summary of that paper which said the adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent. %$* 57
so i think that, particularly bt crops have led to reduced use of insecticides. %$* 57
there have been a number of studies that have looked at herbicides. %$* 57
and depending upon which country you're talking about and which study and which crop. %$* 57
in some cases they've substituted roundup for a different herbicide that they were using that was more environmentally degrading and that stayed longer in the environment and so they've-- %$* 57
okay, you-- %$* 13
moved to a safer herbicide. %$* 57
you nailed that point. %$* 13
i just want to take it to your opponent to respond. %$* 13
i just want to, you know, point out-- %$* 59
margaret mellon. %$* 13
that, for example, the-- %$* 59
the metastudy of the 147 other studies, none of those studies were done after the evolution of resistant organisms, of resistant insects. %$* 59
so, you're saying we don't know? %$* 13
you're saying that what your opponent-- %$* 13
no. %$* 59
i'm saying that the good news stories about biotechnology crops-- %$* 59
and there are some-- %$* 59
are all from the early days. %$* 59
but we know that it is inevitable that resistance is going to develop. %$* 59
i also want to say-- %$* 59
and will undercut all of the benefits that we're talking about. %$* 59
i also want to say that the 147 studies really didn't-- %$* 59
they did prove that there were benefits to gm crops, but not to gm traits. %$* 59
they often compared one group of farmers, say, in india, who had adopted the technology, say a gm cotton technology with other farmers who hadn't. %$* 59
but the gm crops that were grown by the adopters were often much higher-- %$* 59
they'd been conventionally bred to have much improved genetics. %$* 59
and so what you were really comparing was better conventional genetics and a bt crop to-- %$* 59
to kind of poorer genetics without a bt trait. %$* 59
and you know, that really says more about the importance of traditional breeding than it does about ge. %$* 59
does she actually have a point in that analysis? %$* 13
robert fraley? %$* 13
i don't think so. %$* 56
the way to do those studies, if you want to identify the role of the ge trait, is to take isolines that don't have the ge trait, have farmers grow them under the exact same conditions as other farmers who are growing those crops with the ge trait and then see whether there is-- %$* 59
okay. %$* 13
any difference in-- %$* 59
and those-- %$* 59
and the 147 studies %$* 59
let's let alison van eenennaam come in. %$* 13
that's actually-- %$* 57
i mean, that's what's done as part of the agronomic assessment of the performance of gm crops. %$* 57
but these were actual field studies done throughout the world by independent researchers looking at what the actual effects have been. %$* 57
and the effects have been-- %$* 57
i said, you've got to-- %$* 59
you've got to-- %$* 59
yeah, let me bring in-- %$* 13
isolate the ge trait if you're going to give the ge trait credit. %$* 59
so let's-- %$* 13
chuck benbrook. %$* 13
john asked about-- %$* 58
to open up a discussion of the environmental impacts. %$* 58
roundup ready crops are grown now on-- %$* 58
take, 10, 15 seconds and tell people the dynamic of roundup ready crops. %$* 13
okay, so a farmer has a field of corn, soybeans, cotton, and weeds come up. %$* 58
in the past, they had to spray certain herbicides early in the season or cultivate the soil. %$* 58
but-- %$* 58
and it was called roundup. %$* 13
or one of them was called roundup. %$* 13
well, the-- %$* 58
roundup is glyphosate herbicides. %$* 58
and in 1996, the first genetically engineered so-called herbicide tolerant crop came on the market. %$* 58
and scientists at monsanto put a new gene into corn, soybeans, cotton and now other crops that makes it possible to spray to glyphosate, which kills everything green that's growing. %$* 58
it would kill the corn without the gene. %$* 58
and so farmers can spray this broad spectrum herbicide, a very effective herbicide-- %$* 58
and not kill their corn. %$* 13
not kill the corn, but kill the weeds. %$* 58
but what's happened is in the early years, it worked great. %$* 58
but in 2000, in delaware, in a soybean field, the first glyphosate resistant weed-- %$* 58
it was a marestail, was created by roundup ready soybeans. %$* 58
and scientists that warned about this happening before they were developed-- %$* 58
and even predicted it would take about five years-- %$* 58
there it was. %$* 58
okay, so the industry-- %$* 58
okay, we better watch it. %$* 58
by 2004, we had six or eight different serious glyphosate resistant weeds, mostly in the southeast, including this palmer amaranth that the roots of it-- %$* 58
the stock of it can get as big as a person's wrist. %$* 58
and it was breaking the cutter bars on cotton harvesting machines. %$* 58
and now there's like a hundred-- %$* 58
a hundred million acres-- %$* 58
i'm going to give you 15 more seconds. %$* 13
how did those weeds get to be resistant to roundup? %$* 13
what did they-- %$* 13
what was their interaction with the corn? %$* 13
when you spray one herbicide over and over again on weeds, they're going to develop resistance. %$* 58
okay. %$* 13
i just wanted people to understand. %$* 13
so, a random mutation. %$* 13
so, i want to take that to rob fraley. %$* 13
this is your area. %$* 13
yeah, let me reel all the way back in terms of the herbicide tolerant crops and the benefits they provided. %$* 56
so, in the old days, when i was a kid growing up, i'd come home from school, i'd get on my dad's tractor, and we'd plow all the fields this time of year, and we'd turn all the dirt over, and that was the method that people used to kill weeds. %$* 56
the big benefit of roundup ready crops is it gave farmers the ability to use roundup. %$* 56
how many of you in the audience have ever used roundup to control weeds? %$* 56
i mean, it's very effective. %$* 56
it's a very safe product. %$* 56
it's generally regarded as the gold standard. %$* 56
so it gave farmers a more environmentally friendly and a safer tool for controlling weeds. %$* 56
but the huge benefit, and absolutely the huge benefit of herbicide tolerant crops has been the fact that it has basically eliminated tillage. %$* 56
we don't plow fields any more. %$* 56
we don't expose that dirt to evaporation of the moisture. %$* 56
we don't have the erosion. %$* 56
we don't have the instantaneous release of greenhouse gasses when the flip the soil over. %$* 56
and since the adoption of herbicide tolerant crops in this country in the mid '90s, the rate of not plowing, of using conservation tillage has more than doubled. %$* 56
but, robert, are you-- %$* 13
that's a huge benefit. %$* 56
going to get to the point about-- %$* 13
are you going to get to the part about the weeds becoming resistant? %$* 13
sure, absolutely. %$* 56
it's real simple. %$* 56
evolution is alive and continues. %$* 56
and, frankly, you know, we're going to see, as i think we get into issues of climate change and changes in microenvironments, we'll probably see more evolution and more resistance. %$* 56
here's a simple question: you've all heard of antibiotic resistance. %$* 56
it's a problem, right? %$* 56
you're aware of it. %$* 56
so what should drug companies do? %$* 56
should they not develop new antibiotics just because there's become a resistance to an antibiotic? %$* 56
absolutely not. %$* 56
roundup controls hundreds of weeds. %$* 56
in this country, 12 of them have become resistant. %$* 56
it still controls hundreds of weeds. %$* 56
it needs to be used effectively. %$* 56
and, chuck, you were one of the first ones to point out that we should actually use combinations of herbicides. %$* 56
and that's what growers are doing today, and that's one of the benefits of being smarter and stewarding these products better. %$* 56
rob, back when we had that conversation, i might have also suggested it's not a great idea to put antibiotics in plants. %$* 58
do you remember that? %$* 58
we're going to go to audience questions now, and so raise your hand. %$* 13
the mic will be brought to you. %$* 13
we'd appreciate it if you would identify yourself. %$* 13
and if you're a member of the press, we really would like you to identify yourself. %$* 13
i can't resist calling on bill nye, the science guy. %$* 13
but i have to say, bill nye, the science guy, that your question also has to be as good as everybody else's so %$* 13
my question is about time. %$* 60
everybody can agree i think that you can know exactly what happens to any organism, any plant, any crop, but you cannot know-- %$* 60
i believe you cannot know what happens to an ecosystem, so can the four of you agree on a number of seasons, a number of years, a number of plantings and harvestings where we would be-- %$* 60
i think what people are concerned about is the effects on an ecosystem where you accidentally create a-- %$* 60
you were almost at a question mark there. %$* 13
resistant weed %$* 60
say again? %$* 60
you were almost at a question mark. %$* 13
you were-- %$* 13
well, i am-- %$* 60
well, what is the timescale for each side? %$* 60
is it-- %$* 60
for geologic time it's at least centuries, not five seasons. %$* 60
so, that's what everybody-- %$* 60
i think what many people are concerned about with regard to genetically modified foods. %$* 60
thank you. %$* 13
let's take it to margaret mellon. %$* 13
well, i mean, from my perspective the timescale, you know, is something like decades. %$* 59
i mean, in the decades that we have seen herbicide tolerant crops we have seen a dramatic downward effect on the monarchs as a result of roundup killing the monarchs' only food-- %$* 59
you're talking about butterflies? %$* 13
yes, i'm talking about monarch butterflies. %$* 59
it turns out that it's called milkweed. %$* 59
oh, not, not-- %$* 13
come on, you got to-- %$* 59
i'm thinking of people on the podcast, "how did the royal family get into this? %$* 13
i don't-- %$* 59
i wish i knew. %$* 59
just looking for clarity. %$* 13
but, you know, in that period of time the monarch population has decreased by almost 80 percent, and it is certainly because they've been deprived of their food, which is a milkweed. %$* 59
they're – we’re seeing effects on honeybees, on-- %$* 59
and they're all subtle effects, you know. %$* 59
it's not like killing the honeybees, it's making it impossible for the honeybee to find its way back to the nest. %$* 59
and that's why decades, you're saying. %$* 13
crayfish and earthworms, i mean, we are seeing effects right now that have ecological implications, so the timescale is not that great. %$* 59
alison van eenennaam. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i think you're conflating the technology with other issues. %$* 57
i don't-- %$* 57
the monarch butterfly is due to more effective controls of the milkweed. %$* 57
and so if we want more weed then we should grow more weed, but the fact that we're controlling the weed more effectively-- %$* 57
i guess from california i probably shouldn't say that, should i? %$* 57
another debate-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 57
"yes," or, "no," to this statement. %$* 13
you know, there's been no association with gms and honeybees. %$* 57
i think that's just that, that's a red herring out there-- %$* 57
well, there's-- %$* 59
there are-- %$* 59
and-- %$* 57
what concerns me is that we're talking about problems that are associated with the technology without considering the benefits. %$* 59
and there're tradeoffs with every production system. %$* 59
and what we need to do is remove the problems but retain the benefits, not just throw the technology out. %$* 59
chuck benbrook. %$* 13
what i'm concerned about, and many scientists-- %$* 58
is that ge crops came on the market in 1996.monsanto and rob fraley's very talented molecular biologists. %$* 58
they're on their fifth generation now of genetically engineered corn. %$* 58
none of the ge corns that have been on the market have had a dominant position for more than five or six years. %$* 58
so, we are moving from one generation of ge crops to the next to the next before we've even begun to understand what the impacts of the first ones are. %$* 58
so, i would like to have the ability to at least do two crop rotation cycles, which might be six or eight years, to see how the farming system has responded, but in that time period, just that time period, the technology has changed. %$* 58
so, you never really get a handle on what has happened. %$* 58
okay, i'm going to go to another question. %$* 13
far up in the corner against the wall right-- %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name please. %$* 13
hi, my name is amy bentley i teach at new york university. %$* 19
and my question has to do with copyright-- %$* 19
the copyright implications of the gm seeds. %$* 19
if both sides could speak to that, i'd appreciate it. %$* 19
you know what? %$* 13
i'm going to pass on it because it's a-- %$* 13
i'm not saying that it's not relevant to the larger discussion but it's not really getting us to the issues that we've delineated of safety and the impact on the environment. %$* 13
right down here, ma'am. %$* 13
thank you, though, for the question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
my name is nina federoff, and i've been one of the inventors of this molecular technology. %$* 19
you're a ringer! %$* 13
30 years. %$* 19
no. %$* 19
i'm just here. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
by chance. %$* 19
i would like to ask – %$* 19
i would ask-- %$* 19
i'd like to ask rob fraley to tell us historically how rapidly corn lines, and wheat lines, and so forth evolved long before gm had-- %$* 19
yeah. %$* 13
that's-- %$* 13
wait-- %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i'm going to pass on that too-- %$* 13
what, no-- %$* 19
because it's-- %$* 19
well-- %$* 13
very relevant to what benbrook said. %$* 19
in other words, he's saying-- %$* 19
i know. %$* 13
but you're kind of-- %$* 13
here to help out your partner to fix his question-- %$* 13
not your partner, your colleague-- %$* 13
former colleague to fix his questions. %$* 13
so, it's a little messy for me. %$* 13
can i actually answer bill nye's-- %$* 18
dr. %$* 18
nye's question, because-- %$* 18
we can pretend that you're answering bill nye's question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
because you asked the question, what kind of testing is required and what do we need to do? %$* 56
and that's so relevant here, because the testing requirements are developed by the usda, specifically to look at the evolution of pests and the impact on the environments. %$* 56
we do studies for several years to do the analysis that's being reviewed by the agencies for their environmental impacts. %$* 56
and that's one of the key questions. %$* 56
the impact on the ecosystems, the-- %$* 56
on other species. %$* 56
that's all built into that regulatory system. %$* 56
and it's built on the fact that in this country, we have been developing new crops from the beginning of time. %$* 56
new corn hybrids, new soybean varieties, new cotton varieties. %$* 56
and that experience from plant breeding has given us the insights and base the regulations in terms of how the gmo crops are regulated. %$* 56
oh-- %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
uh-- %$* 13
based on real, practical, real-world experience. %$* 56
do you have eyeglasses? %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm michelle. %$* 19
i'm wondering what are some of the scientific studies that have been done linking genetically-engineered foods and crops to human health. %$* 19
what are-- %$* 19
are there-- %$* 19
i feel-- %$* 13
again, i feel that we've covered that pretty extensively. %$* 13
i don't-- %$* 19
well-- %$* 13
i don't think we have. %$* 19
well, we've had-- %$* 13
we've had a number of conversations already about the question of whether the-- %$* 13
what the-- %$* 13
that there's a cascade of studies that look at safety. %$* 13
and i assume that safety refers to health. %$* 13
am i-- %$* 13
does anybody on the panel feel that we haven't addressed that? %$* 13
we're not going to make any progress on that. %$* 58
yeah. %$* 13
that's the only reason-- %$* 13
as i feel, yeah. %$* 13
i do-- %$* 19
very vociferous waving there. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 19
hi, my name is alice. %$* 19
and this question may be answered by either margaret or charles. %$* 19
my question is about the evidence. %$* 19
there's thousands of peer- reviewed studies showing that biotechnology doesn't pose a threat to human health. %$* 19
again-- %$* 13
on top of that-- %$* 19
wait, no. %$* 19
no. %$* 19
this gets to a very valid question. %$* 19
it better. %$* 13
aside from the observational studies, going over multiple generations of over a hundred trillion animal meals-- %$* 19
you're reading. %$* 19
well, i'm sorry that i'm not the most eloquent of speakers, that i can use notes, okay? %$* 19
i'm sorry about that. %$* 19
oh, my god. %$* 13
however, that being asked-- %$* 19
i've lost control. %$* 13
my – %$* 19
may i-- %$* 13

that is a tax rate of six 1/100th of 1 percent on his true income. %$* 15
that is obnoxious. %$* 15
but it's not because of any rates raising would change that tax. %$* 15
you've got to broaden the tax base by getting rid of all these exclusions, deductions, eliminations, and tax true income at low rates. %$* 15
and that is what's fair. %$* 15
the guys who play the game, and you look at the forbes 500 and you see all of them with their tax exemptions, look at all the 501c3s, all the loopholes. %$* 15
that's what we've got to go after, not raising tax rates on the last three people who actually pay it. %$* 15
all right. %$* 13
let me go to bob, bob reich. %$* 13
i keep on hearing my good friend arthur laffer talking about broadening the base. %$* 16
now, do you know exactly what he's talking about when he talks about broadening the base? %$* 16
because it sounds good, doesn't it? %$* 16
i mean, you want to broaden the base; everybody wants to broaden the base. %$* 16
but, arthur, let's be specific. %$* 16
are you willing to close loopholes that the very rich are mostly taking advantage of? %$* 16
yes. %$* 15
okay, now, wait a minute. %$* 16
isn't that an increase-- %$* 16
doesn't that mean a tax increase? %$* 16
no. %$* 15
i'm not-- %$* 15
i thought we're talking about tax rate increases here. %$* 15
we've all gone to that it's tax rates we're talking about. %$* 15
everyone wants to raise taxes by creating prosperity, it would be stupid not to. %$* 15
arthur, arthur-- %$* 16
we are talking about tax rates here. %$* 15
at least me. %$* 15
oh, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. %$* 17
mark zandi. %$* 13
wait, wait, wait. %$* 17
the proposition, the rich are taxed enough. %$* 17
taxed. %$* 17
what we're arguing is that we want to raise more tax revenue. %$* 17
we'd prefer to do it by broadening the tax base. %$* 17
i would love to do it. %$* 17
now, we have to look at it from a clear eyed perspective. %$* 17
can we really-- %$* 17
we've tried, and we've done it once or twice, to broaden the base sufficiently, to raise revenue. %$* 17
but, if we can't, then we raise tax rates. %$* 17
but everyone would agree that we want revenue, and we want to do it through broadening the tax base. %$* 17
let's bring in glenn hubbard. %$* 13
three quick points here. %$* 14
first of all, there's been some discussion of bowles-simpson, but i think it's important for everyone to understand the marginal tax-- %$* 14
the top marginal rate in the bowles-simpson compromise plan is 28 percent. %$* 14
and that's financed by broadening the tax base. %$* 14
if we have a healthy tax system, the growth that that engenders will, in fact, raise revenue, yes, but it's not by raising tax rates. %$* 14
second point, in fairness, is the oecd point that i made. %$* 14
if you look across industrial countries, the u.s.actually has, by far, the most progressive tax system. %$* 14
we rely much more on taxes that affect high income individuals that peer countries, and we do so for the reason i suggested. %$* 14
the third point i want to mention, if you add up all the tax increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in washington, it's about 1 percent of gdp.the congressional budget office has come up tonight. %$* 14
they would tell you that the long-term problem in social security and medicare alone is on the order of 10 percentage points of gdp. anybody who's selling you that taxes on the rich are going to get us out of the fiscal hole doesn't know the math. %$* 14
glenn, just one thing. %$* 17
glenn, are you already saying-- %$* 17
glenn, are you saying that the american system, compared to europe, is more fair than any european tax system? %$* 17
i'm saying it's more progressive, i think it's-- %$* 14
is progressive fair? %$* 17
we need a progressive tax system. %$* 14
the question is, can we balance progressivity and growth? %$* 14
we definitely can. %$* 14
robert reich. %$* 13
okay. %$* 16
first of all, the reason that the european tax system looks more progressive than ours is because the gap between the rich and the poor in europe is not nearly as great as it in the united states. %$* 16
we have the highest gap between the rich and the poor. %$* 16
secondly, arthur laffer just admitted something that i hope you heard. %$* 16
that is that when you close loopholes that are taken advantage of, mostly by the rich, you are, in a sense, raising their taxes. %$* 16
they're actually providing more in taxes. %$* 16
the proposition we are debating is whether the rich are taxed enough. %$* 16
we are saying, mark and i, that that is wrong. %$* 16
the rich are not taxed enough. %$* 16
if one way we use to get the rich to pay more is to close, for example, the carried interest loophole that allows private equity managers to treat their income as capital gains taxed at 15 percent, that means that mitt romney will be taxed more than he is now. %$* 16
art laffer. %$* 13
come on. %$* 15
you got tax rate reduction. %$* 15
if you did tax rate reduction, broaden the base, and you created prosperity, of course we all want more revenues, we don't want deficits. %$* 15
i mean, no one wants it. %$* 15
how do you get it? %$* 15
the way you get it, by the way, is the reagan, kennedy, clinton, and also harding and coolidge did in the u.s., lowering tax rates and creating prosperity with a broad base. %$* 15
that's what this proposition is. %$* 15
the tax rates-- %$* 15
logical avoidance is going on on that side of the aisle. %$* 16
actually, i want to put that question to you, art. %$* 13
i’m bigger than you are. %$* 15
but just barely. %$* 16
robert's point is that closing these loopholes would result in the wealthy paying more of their taxes is because they have more access to these loopholes now. %$* 13
therefore, their taxes would be raised. %$* 13
therefore, he's saying that you're actually arguing for their side ending loopholes. %$* 13
no, well, that's just not true unless it's a parallel arithmetic because the marginal tax rates are coming down at the same time. %$* 14
so, what you're doing is raising revenue in a more efficient way. %$* 14
some individuals may pay more. %$* 14
and, if the economy grows, virtually everyone will pay more, and that's just fine. %$* 14
but, raising marginal tax rates, which has been the siren song of the tax debate, is just wrong. %$* 14
no, can i-- %$* 18
do you agree that we should lower tax rates on the rich? %$* 15
if we generate tax revenue. %$* 17
okay. %$* 15
i think you just agreed with us. %$* 15
can i make a few points-- %$* 17
yes, mark zandi? %$* 13
in response to some of the points that were made. %$* 17
first, this is my view. %$* 17
glenn, i think we need to address spending. %$* 17
we have to. %$* 17
i mean, if you look at simpson-bowles or any proposal that's reasonable, most of the onus of addressing our fiscal problems is on the spending side. %$* 17
so, i'm with you on that. %$* 17
but, all of these proposals also say we need to generate revenue. %$* 17
this has got to be a shared burden in terms of spending and tax. %$* 17
so, no disagreement there. %$* 17
the second thing i say is that if we can raise tax revenue by lowering the deductions and credits in the tax code-- %$* 17
and there're some very creative ways of doing it. %$* 17
marty feldstein has a great proposal. %$* 17
both governor romney and president obama have put proposals that are not dissimilar in this regard in terms of capping the amount of deductions and credits that an individual can take, and that would burden-- %$* 17
in theory, would land on higher-income households. %$* 17
i'm all for that. %$* 17
but i think it's also important that we do this in a way that we're clear-eyed, because-- %$* 17
in a political sense, a political economy sense-- %$* 17
because we know it's going to be really hard to scale back those deductions and credits in the tax code. %$* 17
it's-- %$* 17
you know, for every credit and deduction in the code, there is a constituency that literally will go to war for it. %$* 17
so, we know that. %$* 17
so, in that context, we have to think about-- %$* 17
well, maybe we have to raise marginal rates to generate that revenue, to get to the point where we're going to address our long-term fiscal problems and-- %$* 17
as a temporary thing, not as a long-term principle of the way-- %$* 13
yeah, absolutely. %$* 17
you can't-- %$* 17
let's bring in glenn hubbard, please. %$* 13
you can't do that either in the short-term or the long-term. %$* 14
so, let's be clear. %$* 14
the current budget has spending full three percentage points higher than traditional levels in the country. %$* 14
it is proposing to raise taxes on high-income people by 1 percent of gdp, and we just don't know what happens to the other two. %$* 14
in the long term, as i've said, just social security and medicare alone are 10 times the cost, even of the most optimistic tax increases. %$* 14
so, taxes aren't even an important part of this conversation. %$* 14
and, to the extent that they are, they would have to follow the european model, which is to raise them on everyone, a consumption tax. %$* 14
robert reich. %$* 13
we're getting tangled in a semantic dispute, and i want to be very, very clear about what we are actually arguing. %$* 16
there are two ways of raising revenues. %$* 16
almost everybody up here agrees, i think, that we've got to raise some revenues. %$* 16
we may have to do a lot of spending reductions as well, but we've got to raise some revenues if we're going to deal with the budget deficit problem. %$* 16
there are two ways of doing it. %$* 16
one is raising marginal income tax rates, and the second is closing loopholes. %$* 16
now, the question really is when you do one or both of those, are you going to have the rich paying more, or is the middle class going to have to pay more, or the poor going to have to pay more? %$* 16
what mark and i are saying is that when you get more revenue, either by closing loopholes or by raising marginal rates, the rich should end up paying more as a matter of logic, as a matter of fairness, as a matter of history, as a matter of common sense. %$* 16
all right. %$* 13
art laffer, so your opponent is saying-- %$* 13
this is a debate about-- %$* 13
this is a debate about whose hide is it going to come out of, and he's saying it needs to come out of the rich's hide. %$* 13
let's just talk about it. %$* 15
of course you do. %$* 15
i mean-- %$* 15
and there's nothing wrong with the rich paying more in taxes if-- %$* 15
with the prosperity, which is exactly what happened, what i showed in the numbers there. %$* 15
during the roaring '20s, the rich paid more as a share of gdp by lowering rates dramatically. %$* 15
if you look at the kennedy period, the rich paid a lot more as a share of gdp by lowering rates dramatically. %$* 15
under the reagan/clinton period, the rich paid a lot more by lowering rates dramatically and creating prosperity. %$* 15
that is the dream, and that's where we go. %$* 15
you cannot balance the budget on the backs of the unemployed. %$* 15
you just plain can't. %$* 15
and that's what you have to do. %$* 15
robert reich. %$* 13
i think that when arthur laffer, my dear friend when you just said-- %$* 16
my friend is kind of a dubious term here-- %$* 13
when you just said that it's fine, it's fine for the rich to pay more through closing loopholes, i think you just lost-- %$* 16
the entire debate. %$* 16
but-- %$* 16
but beyond that, i want to point out, this is an interesting historic footnote-- %$* 16
arthur, you keep going back to the 1920s, the roaring '20s, there were two years over the last century, two years in which the richest americans took home the highest percentage of total income in america. %$* 16
those two years were 1928 and 2007. now, does it strike anybody here interesting-- %$* 16
as a matter of what happens when the rich take home so much of the total income, does it strike anybody here that there may be a consequence? %$* 16
there may be. %$* 16
but, robert, how do you relate that to this motion? %$* 13
land that on this motion. %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 16
relate that point to this motion. %$* 13
the motion should not be voted for. %$* 16
it's an insane motion. %$* 16
can i make one-- %$* 17
i think you did tonight's grandstanding but you didn't land-- %$* 13
let me advance the ball just a little bit, and that is-- %$* 17
it's very important to look at effective tax rates, so that's how much i pay in tax relative to the income i earn, not the marginal rates, it's the effective tax rates. %$* 17
and if you look at effective tax rates across the income distribution, and not just income tax but you consider the payroll tax, you consider the incidence of corporate tax, excise taxes, you know, you roll it all up, this is data, you can go look it up, it's congressional budget office data, and they have it over time, it's true that effective tax rates have fallen for everybody across the income distribution since the date it begins, 1979, 1980, but it's also true that it's fallen very significantly for higher income households. %$* 17
and, in fact, interesting statistic, for the top 1 percent of earners, the decline in the effective tax rate, 1979 to 2010, has declined by more than any other income group, the effective tax rate. %$* 17
so you can argue, and this is often the argument you will hear, that the wealthy pay their higher share of total taxes, but the reason is because they're earning so much more income, and their effective tax rate is a lot-- %$* 17
let's bring in glenn hubbard. %$* 13
yeah, again, if you look both at shares of income and shares of taxes paid, the u.s.is the most progressive, the cbo, not to get too much into the weeds here, really is not attributing the corporation income tax in any way that's really going to change those numbers, and on tax reform and growth it is certainly the case that if we broadened the base and lowered the rates we would get growth. %$* 14
otherwise, why are we going to do tax reform? %$* 14
and that's fine, but that will raise revenue. %$* 14
but we are not arguing for non- revenue neutral tax changes. %$* 14
it's up to you to argue that raising marginal rates, which you've referred to a few times this evening, actually is the way to go. %$* 14
yes. %$* 18
john, you asked me, "why is it relevant that in two years, that is, 1928, and 2007, the rich took home the highest percentage of total income that they've taken-- %$* 16
that's why it's relevant to the motion. %$* 13
it's relevant to the motion in the following way, because behind this motion is a question about the relationship between fairness and economic growth. %$* 16
that's what we are discussing tonight. %$* 16
and my contention and the contention that i think mark agrees with as well, is that there is not an inconsistency between fairness and economic growth. %$* 16
in fact, the rich would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a large share of an economy that's dead in the water. %$* 16
why? %$* 16
because it's dead in the water because the distribution of income is so crazy. %$* 16
yeah, but-- %$* 18
and that's why-- %$* 16
and that is directly relevant to the point that arthur and glenn are making, or are attempting to make-- %$* 16
and are not making actually very well-- %$* 16
art laffer. %$* 13
there he was almost nice, but seriously, i mean, the point of it here is "let's take the '20s that you're talking about." we had those tax cuts. %$* 15
we had that growth. %$* 15
we have the rich becoming very prosperous. %$* 15
there's nothing wrong with the rich being rich. %$* 15
the problem is when the poor are poorer. %$* 15
the dream has always been to make the poor rich, and during the '20s, when we had the roaring '20s, no other country did the tax codes we did. %$* 15
after world war i they all stayed in depression the whole time. %$* 15
that is the key here. %$* 15
there's nothing wrong with the prosperity we had from the '80s on. %$* 15
but i'll tell you what happened in the 1920s-- %$* 15
and they paid a lot more in taxes. %$* 15
and the exact same thing happened leading up to the crash of 2008, and that is the median wages were stuck in the mud, the-- %$* 16
really the growth and the gains from growth, went to the top. %$* 16
what happened? %$* 16
people in the middle, in order to maintain their standard of living, they borrowed, they borrowed, and they borrowed. %$* 16
and people at the top gambled, and they gambled recklessly. %$* 16
and those bubbles exploded in 1929 and in 2008. %$* 16
again, a great applause line, but i'm not seeing how this is justifying taxing the rich. %$* 13
but i want to bring-- %$* 13
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
mark very helpfully, earlier, referred to a lot of structural problems facing the country. %$* 14
those are problems that are subjects of another debate, but it is very important to ask the question to you, mark, or to you, bob, how is it that raising marginal tax rates on high income people gets at any of those structural problems? %$* 14
you referred to globalization, there are skill gaps among low income people, i'm not connecting the dots, from your tax policy to dealing with the problem that actually should concern america. %$* 14
yeah, that's a very good question. %$* 17
i think it's important that we address the distribution of income and wealth, because if we don't, we're going to have the situation that arthur joked about but is very serious. %$* 17
and that is that the wealthy will capture the system. %$* 17
art joked about buying a senator, buying a congressman. %$* 17
i don't think that's a joke. %$* 17
i mean, i think that's a very serious issue. %$* 17
it's happening. %$* 16
and we can't allow that to happen. %$* 17
agreed. %$* 18
this is the reason why we have to be very, very conscious of this. %$* 17
we have to have enough revenue that goes to the government, to be able to build out the infrastructure we need. %$* 17
we need the revenue to go to the government sufficient to educate the population and bring the skill attainment of those workers that are getting creamed by china up, so that they can compete in a global economy. %$* 17
we can't do that unless we have sufficient revenue. %$* 17
now, we all know revenue is very low, 17 percent of gdp. since 1980, the revenue to gdp ratio was averaged 19.5 percent. %$* 17
it's very, very low. %$* 17
government spending is high. %$* 17
i'm all for getting government spending down. %$* 17
i think that's absolutely correct, but we also have to, in a balanced way, get revenue up-- %$* 17
mark, can i bring-- %$* 13
can i make one other point? %$* 17
i have to make one other point. %$* 17
sure, yeah. %$* 13
because this goes right to arthur's-- %$* 17
yeah. %$* 15
you know, arthur, you may be right. %$* 17
you know, you may be right-- %$* 17
don't me. %$* 16
we don't have to %$* 16
this is very important. %$* 17
you know, you argue lower tax rates improve economic growth, all else being equal. %$* 17
and, you know, i have some sympathy to that argument when we're lowering tax rates from 90 percent, which is what they were when kennedy took office and we lowered them to 70.and ronald reagan took them from 70 to 28.you know, the academic literature on this, frankly, is not clear. %$* 17
there's no proof academically, but, okay, i'm sympathetic to the idea. %$* 17
but what i think is prudent-- %$* 17
if i were a prudent planner, and if i was sitting at the onb or the cbo, i'd say, "you know what? %$* 17
we better-- %$* 17
if we raise taxes or lower tax rates, if we move tax rates, if we move tax rates-- %$* 17
we better think about this in an accounting sense, not in, we can generate some economic growth and that's going to generate revenue, and, by the way, the kids are going to be dancing in the streets and eating chocolate bars. %$* 17
you know, that's not what we should be doing. %$* 17
we should be thinking about this in a purely accounting-- %$* 17
well, and if it all works out and you're right, that's gravy, we're fine. %$* 17
and it will and i am. %$* 15
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
i think it's important to know that there is actually a lot of work in economics, and pretty conclusive about the positive effects of tax reform. %$* 14
it's one of the few not-- %$* 14
no one’s arguing tax reform, glenn. %$* 17
no one's arguing. %$* 17
we are. %$* 18
lowering rates, broadening the base, that's one of the most fundamental results in economics. %$* 14
and i think the beauty has been-- %$* 14
or the difficultly, the politicians are normally scared. %$* 14
but, frankly, as an economic matter, i don't think it's controversial. %$* 14
if you had the size of government that we had before the financial crisis, the normally functioning tax system would, roughly, fund that size of government. %$* 14
if you'd like, in your description of more for education and more for infrastructure, if what you mean is, you'd like a bigger government-- %$* 14
no. %$* 17
i'll come back to the point i made before, you can't fund that on taxing the rich. %$* 14
that's just math. %$* 14
why not? %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
because the-- %$* 14
if you look at all of the tax increases that are currently being proposed, and i haven’t heard any politician on the left say they'd like even more, that's about 1 percent of gdp. the present budget has an elevated spending level of more than 3 percent of gdp, and that's before the entitlement programs-- %$* 14
but isn't there still a lot of upward room to raise rates on the rich, other than what's proposed now? %$* 13
i think there's a lot of pushback, both from economists, and probably more important, from politicians, on the tax increases that are being proposed now. %$* 14
why is there pushback from politicians on increasing the taxes on the rich or closing loopholes that the rich take advantage of, it's because of the increasing political power of many of those same rich. %$* 16
that is the closed system we are dealing with. %$* 16
that is one of the reasons that you've got to start addressing this issue of inequality. %$* 16
art laffer. %$* 13
these are exactly the problems we had in '86, and that's exactly what we did. %$* 15
we took all of these loopholes and dumped them all, and we got a broader base. %$* 15
reagan said he would not-- %$* 15
he would veto the bill if it were either tax-raising or tax-lowering. %$* 15
it was a tax reform bill that went across. %$* 15
we lowered the highest rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. %$* 15
and, in the senate, we got 97 votes, three against us, and all these others voted with us. %$* 15
it was obvious for all those politicians. %$* 15
and they did it. %$* 15
it's quite obvious right now as well. %$* 15
john, can i just-- %$* 17
yeah, mark zandi. %$* 13
i just want to present some numbers. %$* 17
these are just accounting. %$* 17
it comes from simpson-bowles. %$* 17
not a ton of numbers. %$* 13
okay. %$* 17
it's pretty straight-forward. %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
now, under simpson-bowles, to achieve something-- %$* 17
what you might call fiscal sustainability, that is deficits in the future that are small enough that our debt-to-gdp ratio stabilizes, but the-- %$* 17
a little bit of arithmetic, we need $3 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years. %$* 17
you know, we can debate the number, but let's go with it. %$* 17
simpson-bowles would say, dominici-rivlin would say let's do $2 trillion in government spending, let's get $1 trillion in tax revenue, right? %$* 17
and they would say, "let's do the tax revenue by broadening the base, but if we can't broaden the base, we got to get the revenue from somewhere, right? %$* 17
" and if you do those things then, then-- %$* 17
glenn-- %$* 17
then the expenditure-to-gdp ratio goes to 21 percent-- %$* 17
that's the average since 1980-- %$* 17
and the revenue-to-gdp goes to 19 percent. %$* 17
that's the average to 1980. %$* 17
that's actually-- %$* 14
let me just correct the numbers. %$* 14
bowles-simpson actually would raise - - %$* 14
is everybody getting this down? %$* 13
this is when economists really get down and dirty. %$* 14
i know, i know. %$* 13
it's a problem. %$* 13
the bowles-simpson would raise two percentage points of gdp in revenue to fund a 21 percent government, but it's important again to understand that bowles-simpson is delivering marginal rates at reagan-era levels. %$* 18
there wasn't any discussion in bowles-simpson of, "oh, well, if we can't do this, we'll do that." bowles-simpson is a classic broaden the base, lower the rate. %$* 18
let me pull something out, let me pull something out-- %$* 13
it's $1 trillion in revenue-- %$* 17
gentlemen, let me pull something out of the exchange we've just been through and bring to mark zandi. %$* 13
basically, glenn hubbard was saying that he understood what your aspirations were for funding certain kinds of government programs that would be restorative of education, et cetera, and he said that you can't get it from the wealthy, that if-- %$* 13
politically, you can't get it, you can't raise rates to that degree for the reason that bob gave because it's a closed loop. %$* 13
i want to know economically could you get it, because their argument is that economically you can't because the behavior of the wealthy would change in such a way that they just wouldn't-- %$* 13
they wouldn't participate. %$* 13
number one, they wouldn't participate-- %$* 13
they would move their money offshore, and they wouldn't invest here. %$* 13
and that's kind of the core of their argument. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 17
i mean, i don't think that-- %$* 17
first of all, i think the best way of approaching this is broadening the tax base. %$* 17
that's-- %$* 17
i'm on board with that. %$* 17
but if we have to go down-- %$* 17
if we can't raise the revenue, the trillion in revenue through tax broadening, i'm all for raising marginal rates. %$* 17
but, when i talk about raising marginal rates, i'm talking about putting them back to the era when this fellow was labor secretary and generating 22 million jobs. %$* 17
i'm talking about 35 percent today to 39.6 percent on personal income. %$* 17
and you can-- %$* 17
we can talk about cap gains and dividend income and so forth and obamacare and health care tax, all those kinds of things-- %$* 17
those kinds of things will generate a trillion in revenue. %$* 17
and i don't think-- %$* 17
and, again, this is my view, experience-- %$* 17
i don't thinkthe american wealthy are going to move offshore and not pay their taxes. %$* 17
we know that they aren't. %$* 16
we know that they aren't because there have been a number of experiments. %$* 16
one experiment is an experiment that we ran in this country between 1946 and 1981 when tax rates, as i said before-- %$* 16
officially, marginal tax rates were at least 70 percent, and the effective rate after deductions and tax credits was about 54, 55, 56 percent. %$* 16
maybe it was slightly more difficult then to move abroad or shift your money abroad, that's true, but also legally we could have then, as we can now, make it very difficult to do that. %$* 16
the real issue here-- %$* 16
and, glenn, what you keep on wanting to do, and art, you do too-- %$* 16
is you are saying in effect we ought to broaden the base and not raise marginal rates. %$* 16
lower. %$* 18
and what you-- %$* 16
yeah, and what you're hearing from us is we're happy to do whatever you want to do to raise revenues, that is close the loopholes or raise the rates-- %$* 16
as long as most of those revenues come from the people who are best situated to bear the burden, and that is the rich who are richer now than they've ever been as a proportion of total income. %$* 16
now, if you agree with us, then this proposition-- %$* 16
all right. %$* 13
you have to vote against-- %$* 16
i want to let glenn hubbard respond to that, but i-- %$* 13
right after his answer, i'm going to come to you for questions so prepare terse focused questions on this motion, and we'll be delighted to have you participate. %$* 13
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
three quick points, first of all, again-- %$* 14
you don’t have to be that quick. %$* 13
he was pretty-- %$* 13
yeah, well, what art and i are arguing is to the extent that revenues come from faster growth from a reform system, we're fine for that. %$* 14
you keep moving the goalposts, but you're talking about marginal rates and not that. %$* 14
second, there are significant real effects of raising taxes on business owners. %$* 14
there's a huge body of research out there. %$* 14
you might not like it, but it is there. %$* 14
and the third-- %$* 14
the question to you about your aspirations, again, social security and medicare, these two programs are on track to rise 10 percentage points of gdp. %$* 14
now, if you want to tax, finance that, you mentioned that a healthy-- %$* 14
i don't. %$* 17
healthy revenue share in gdp is 19 percent, you'd have to raise every tax-- %$* 14
it's a red herring. %$* 17
it's a red herring. %$* 17
i don't. %$* 17
you can't get there from here. %$* 14
i agree with you. %$* 17
we need entitlement reform and we need spending cuts. %$* 17
i'm on board with that. %$* 17
let's go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
and, sir, right down-- %$* 13
yeah, right there, yeah. %$* 13
and if you wait for a pause so the camera can find you, and it would help actually if you could step out to your left just so that you're bright-- %$* 13
in the brighter light, and let us know your name and really a good question. %$* 13
i’m from columbia business school, the question is for mr. %$* 18
laffer. %$* 18
hey, hey, hey, is this fair? %$* 17
we're everywhere. %$* 14
wait till you hear the question. %$* 18
my question is to mr. %$* 18
laffer, he just took the example of warren buffett, who's on a stated income of 40 million paid 7 million in taxes, whereas you think his income was 12 billion. %$* 18
so if whichever way, the loopholes are closed or the rates increase, don't you think the rich man should be paying more and, therefore, don't you think this motion-- %$* 18
warren is a columbia business school graduate. %$* 14
that’s how you answer this question. %$* 14
art laffer, take that question. %$* 13
but let me answer two things, there are two ways of raising revenues. %$* 15
one is to broaden the base and one is to lower rates, not raise them. %$* 15
and that is the way to get your prosperity. %$* 15
as you looked at every time, you go back to the kennedy period where rates were much higher and all that, when kennedy lowered those rates, guess what happened to revenues? %$* 15
they went up as a share of gdp, not down from the top 1 percent of income earners. %$* 15
not only did those revenues go up, but there were secondary and tertiary rate-- %$* 15
revenues going in, for the jobs that they created the output, the employment, the production, all of that. %$* 15
they're huge revenue raisers. %$* 15
that is not true of any other income group. %$* 15
it's not. %$* 15
you raise tax rates on the poor or the middle income and you collect more revenues, but not on the rich. %$* 15
you want more revenues from the rich, which i do, what you do is you broaden the base and you lower the rates, and both of those will bring you more revenue, period. %$* 15
how low would you lower them? %$* 17
how low would you go? %$* 17
well, it doesn't go to zero, let's put it there. %$* 15
to zero? %$* 17
i will stipulate today-- %$* 15
bowles-simpson seems that 28 percent-- %$* 17
yeah. %$* 15
seems like a good place. %$* 17
and, you know, we did an '86 down to 28 percent. %$* 15
that's a good number, or leave it where it is. %$* 15
why not lower, though? %$* 17
how about-- %$* 15
why not? %$* 17
you could maybe go lower. %$* 15
i’m asking you art. %$* 17
why not 15 percent? %$* 17
if you broaden the base enough-- %$* 15
why not 10? %$* 17
why not 5? %$* 17
if you were-- %$* 15
i mean, i will-- %$* 15
none of you guys will agree with me here, but if you taxes unrealized capital gains and raise the bases, you could get it really low. %$* 15
if you wouldn't allow all the 501c3s and have football tickets at oklahoma, be tax exempt, i think you'd get it really low. %$* 15
there's a huge amount of income out there that is not taxed at all, that. %$* 15
and then you lower the rate like i did with gerry brown-- %$* 15
and i want to go to another question. %$* 13
rob reich. %$* 13
the question before the house is not, "do you broaden the base? %$* 16
and do you raise or lower marginal rates? %$* 16
" the question is, should the rich pay more or are the rich taxed enough? %$* 16
now, let's take an example. %$* 16
take the mortgage interest deduction, which is the most sacred of sacred cows. %$* 16
now, here is what we know about the mortgage interest deduction. %$* 16
mortgage interest deduction is essentially a subsidy for housing, but who gets the lion's share of the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction? %$* 16
well, here's what we know, that four times more of that subsidy goes to the top 20 percent of americans, than the total amount of public housing assistance that goes to the bottom 20 percent of americans. %$* 16
so why not limit the total mortgage interest deduction per year, to something like, let's say, $10,000 per year. %$* 16
why not limit other deductions to, say, a total of $10,000 or $12,000 a year. %$* 16
you-- %$* 16
if you do that, you are increasing revenues from the rich. %$* 16
if you do that, you are actually voting against the proposition. %$* 16
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to another question, but, first, i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have two teams of two who are arguing it out over this motion: the rich are taxed enough. %$* 13
another question from the audience. %$* 13
right down the front here. %$* 13
i'm jackie hotlier i wanted to direct this question to you guys, with respect to-- %$* 19
you want to address to the side arguing against the motion? %$* 13
yes, the con side. %$* 19
i wanted to know what you guys think about small businesses, are they really going to be affected if the tax rate increases? %$* 19
i love small businesses. %$* 16
my father was a small businessman. %$* 16
he was small and he was a small businessman. %$* 16
but, look, if we, for example, as a nation decide that next year we are going to continue the bush tax cuts for people earning under $250,000, but the income over $250,000 is going to go back to the clinton kind of rates, is that going to be such a huge burden for small businesses? %$* 16
well, only about 2 to 3 percent of the small businesses earn over $250,000.and we're only talking about that amount of income over $250,000, so a small businessperson who earns $251,000 that year is only going to be paying the clinton rate on $1,000 of income. %$* 16
and, by the way, that clinton rate was not so onerous; small businesses did much better under bill clinton than they've doing recently over the last 10 years. %$* 16
glenn hubbard. %$* 13
the reference to small numbers, small businesses being at the top misses the fact that about half of the people in the top 1 percent are business owners. %$* 14
and, if you look at the calculation that i made for you, if you compare what's going to happen to investment and hiring by those individuals as they're paying taxes at individual rates, you're looking at changes on the order of 50 percent in investment, 14 percent in hiring, in an era when the economy is struggling. %$* 14
you know, there's a reason the president took a pass on raising marginal rates the last time. %$* 14
okay, another question. %$* 13
john, can i? %$* 17
oh, sure. %$* 13
mark zandi. %$* 13
just to reinforce the point, this is why i told you my story about being the egghead entrepreneur, because i was an s chapter corporation, i was one of those of folks in the top 3 percent. %$* 17
and my experience says, no, it doesn't matter. %$* 17
i'm driven by lots of other things and raising marginal rates from 35 to 40 or 45, it's not going to make a difference in terms of my thinking. %$* 17
so, no. %$* 17
my experience-- %$* 17
and i don't think the data suggests that this is going to have a significant impact. %$* 17
one other thing about small business that i just think it's very important to point out, that most small businesses are proprietorships, they're professionals like doctors and dentists, plumbers, electricians, they're not making $250,000, they're not going to be affected by this. %$* 17
the folks that are going to be affected by this are, you know, they're hedge fund owners, they're different kinds of small businesses that, they're motivated by different things. %$* 17
so when people talk about small business, they have some-- %$* 17
they're thinking about something totally different than the folks that will be affected by the higher marginal rates that we're talking about here. %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
ma’am. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
could you stand up? %$* 13

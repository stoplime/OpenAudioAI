we're delighted to have you taking part in this-- %$* 13
what for us is a special series, the fact that we have the word, "constitutional," in the motion is very relevant. %$* 13
and i want to now bring to the stage nick rosenkranz, who is at-- %$* 13
a professor at georgetown university, and with intelligence squared u.s. as well, to talk about how-- %$* 13
why it is we're framing the debate this way and what this series is all about. %$* 13
so let's please welcome to the stage nicholas rosenkranz. %$* 13
so as i just told the audience, the constitutionality of this issue is critical. %$* 13
it's why the word is in the motion, which to be-- %$* 13
clarify, that means we're not doing what tonight? %$* 13
yes, so we have a series of public policy debates, "do you think x is a good idea or a bad idea? %$* 608
" this is emphatically not that debate. %$* 608
this is about whether this is constitutional or unconstitutional quite regardless of whether you think this is a good idea or a bad idea. %$* 608
so this is-- %$* 608
okay, can you just bring the mic a little closer? %$* 13
so this is very much not a debate about your thoughts on a particular military action or on obama in particular; this is about constitutionality. %$* 608
consider, you know, a vote for obama here tonight is-- %$* 608
it might implicitly be a vote for george w.bush of yesterday or ted cruz of tomorrow. %$* 608
this is not a vote about this president or this policy; it's about constitutionality. %$* 608
and, nick, you are the law professor, so give us a little glossary about-- %$* 13
you know, take us for a minute to the text of the constitution, and give us a little sense of what language is actually there. %$* 13
yeah, so the constitution quite deliberately divides up war powers and gives some war powers to the congress in article i-- %$* 608
i see that you have got in on the screen here-- %$* 608
and some war powers to the president in article ii. so most importantly the president-- %$* 608
congress is given the power to declare war, but on the other hand the president is given the commander in chief power. %$* 608
and so this debate is largely about where the line is between those two clauses: what the significance is of congress's power, what's the significance of the president's power, and how these clauses fit together. %$* 608
and it would seem obvious, "declare war," what that means, but obviously this is tangled. %$* 13
so what is it about the reality of the world we live in that makes this a constitutionally tangled question? %$* 13
so oddly, interestingly, the congress has not declared war since world war ii, so that was the last time-- %$* 608
that one was clearly a war. %$* 608
that was clearly a war, right? %$* 608
but since then we've got all sorts of military actions that are, you know, i guess you could say, "quasi-wars." they're police actions or we're hunting terrorists or we're acting in self-defense. %$* 608
they don't exactly look like armies marching into battle on a particular battlefield. %$* 608
they're much more ambiguous than that, and so that's-- %$* 608
how do these clauses apply to this more fluid, more modern use of our military? %$* 608
so and that is why there is a constitutional debate. %$* 13
that's it, exactly. %$* 608
all right, well, we'll look forward to it. %$* 13
thanks, very much, nick rosenkranz. %$* 13
let's bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
a welcoming round of applause. %$* 13
everybody settled? %$* 13
terrific. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
again, to kick off our broadcast, ask for one more of those special rounds of applause that you're doing so well already. %$* 13
in its two centuries-plus of existence, the u.s. has committed troops to conflicts overseas at least 182 times and counting. %$* 13
congress has declared war 11 of those times, and not since pearl harbor, and certainly not during the administration of barack obama, who has initiated drone attacks in pakistan and yemen, bombing runs in libya, air strikes on isis, with his administration taking the position that he does not require a declaration of war, or really, even any sort of new permission from congress. %$* 13
so, is he right? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the miller theatre at columbia university. %$* 13
we're in partnership with the richard paul richman center and the national constitution center. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two against two-- %$* 13
who will argue for and against this motion: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience here at the miller theatre at columbia university will vote to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, again: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
let's meet the team first arguing for the motion. %$* 13
welcome, ladies and gentleman, gene healy. %$* 13
gene, you are vice president of the cato institute. %$* 13
you research there executive power and the role of the presidency. %$* 13
right on target. %$* 13
you have said in the past that our presidential candidates talk as if they are running for guardian angel, shaman, and supreme warlord of the earth. %$* 13
and we like it. %$* 13
we got what we deserved, you said. %$* 13
but i want to ask, though, have we had any elected officials who are non-supreme warlords in our recent history? %$* 13
well, i'm afraid i don't have anything good to say about any of the recent ones, but i do always tell people that warren g.harding gets a bad rap. %$* 609
it's time america forgave him for teapot dome. %$* 609
thank you. %$* 13
gene healy. %$* 13
and gene, tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
the distinguished and charming deborah pearlstein. %$* 609
ladies and gentlemen, welcome deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
deborah, you're also arguing for the motion that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional approval. %$* 13
you are a professor of cardozo law. %$* 13
you served as the founding director of the law and security program at human rights first. %$* 13
like your partner, gene, you believe that the president has overreached, but you trace the problem back to the framers of the constitution, who made what critical mistake? %$* 13
if i had to sum it up, i'd say they expected that the legislature would actually want to legislate. %$* 610
and it hasn't worked out. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for this motion. %$* 13
again, the motion is that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
two debaters arguing against this motion. %$* 13
please, let's first welcome philip bobbitt. %$* 13
philip, you have a bit of a hometown crowd here because you are a professor at columbia law school, and director of its center for national security. %$* 13
you are a constitutional scholar. %$* 13
you've been a history don at oxford. %$* 13
you've advised presidents on national security issues since the carter administration. %$* 13
you wrote, a few years back, that the seeds of confusion that surround the whole question we're debating tonight-- %$* 13
presidential war powers-- %$* 13
actually started building up 50 years ago, beginning with what? %$* 13
i think it began with a number of senators experiencing buyer’s remorse over the gulf of tonkin resolution. %$* 611
and here we are now, 50 years later. %$* 13
not much progress made. %$* 13
and counting. %$* 611
ladies and gentlemen, philip bobbitt. %$* 13
and philip, please tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
this is akhil amar, who has been called the most celebrated constitutional scholar of his generation. %$* 611
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome akhil amar. %$* 13
and akhil, you're also arguing against this motion, that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
you are a professor at yale law. %$* 13
you have been described as, quote, "commendably unorthodox." congratulations. %$* 13
you are also the author of a lot of books. %$* 13
most recently, "america's unwritten constitution." so, in a sentence, tell me who writes america's unwritten constitution. %$* 13
the american people. %$* 612
we've given our hearts and minds to thomas jefferson's declaration of independence, to abe lincoln's gettysburg address-- %$* 612
in the middle of an undeclared war, by the way-- %$* 612
to martin king's "i have a dream" speech, to brown v. %$* 612
board of education. %$* 612
these are all elements of america's unwritten constitution. %$* 612
so, a lot of history in this story and in this debate tonight. %$* 13
please welcome all of our debaters. %$* 13
thank you as we-- %$* 13
move forward to the first vote by the audience. %$* 13
because this is a debate it's a contest, and you our live audience here at the miller theatre, will determine the winner by your vote. %$* 13
by the time the arguments have been presented you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once after hearing them, and the team whose numbers have moved you the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's register your first vote. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, again, pay attention to numbers one, two, and three. %$* 13
take a close look at the motion the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree push number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys, which are not live, and if you inadvertently push the wrong key just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
no one needs more time, correct? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
let's move forward. %$* 13
let's move onto round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each, and here speaking in the first position, i'd like to welcome to her lectern, deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
she's an assistant professor at the cardozo law of-- %$* 13
the cardozo school of law, and former director of the law and security program at human rights first. %$* 13
she is arguing for the motion: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 610
thank you. %$* 610
well, it's a pleasure to be here, and thank you for the opportunity. %$* 610
the president has certainly exceeded his constitutional power by waging war without congressional authorization for the following reasons. %$* 610
first, as nick rosenkranz mentioned at the top, the text of the constitution, the history, are actually quite clear on the idea that power over armed forces, power to commit those troops, to make war wherever they do it, is shared between the executive and the congress. %$* 610
the executive would have the power as commander in chief to superintend the armed forces. %$* 610
he would also have the power to repel sudden attacks in the event our nation came under attack, but the vast majority of the power over the armed forces, and over war making in the united states, if you look in the constitution, it's there under article i section 8.it's given to congress. %$* 610
they have the power to raise and support an army, to provide and maintain a navy, to issue letters of mark and reprisal, an old fashioned way of saying to appoint agents or to hire agents of the u.s. government, who would carry out lesser military actions against our enemies. %$* 610
and of course, congress also has the power to declare war. %$* 610
the reason this matters, the text matters, is because the purpose of the framers was also clear. %$* 610
the president would have the power to act in our national defense if it was necessary, but actually commencing war, risking huge sums in national blood and treasure, that no one man should have the power to do. %$* 610
madison said, "in no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive. %$* 610
the trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man." now, my opponents will tell you that it's not so much what the text of the constitution says, or even why the constitution said it that way, but what matters is what we've actually done, and in particular, what presidents have actually done in the past, say, 50 or 60 years of the nation's history, because before that they almost always went to congress to at least get an authorization for the use of force. %$* 610
so, let's set aside for the moment the notion that it's a little bit of a weird way to interpret the constitution by saying, well, it means whatever the president has been doing, and thinks he can get away with, in every-- %$* 610
any given administration. %$* 610
let's set that aside for a minute. %$* 610
let's also set aside the problem of that methodology, which is how do we decide we agree on what particular presidents did, and more importantly, why they were doing it. %$* 610
were they acting in national defense or did they have a clear sense even in their own minds of what the purpose was for deploying force in a given case? %$* 610
let's set both of those aside for now and make it clear that no president in the united states has declared or asserted an unlimited power to make war without congressional authorization. %$* 610
the office of legal counsel-- %$* 610
right, this is the office in the department of justice that counsels the president on how much power he has to use force abroad-- %$* 610
recognizes in its memoranda limits that the president has to follow when he uses force without congressional authorization. %$* 610
and even this president, his olc said "look, you can only do this without congress if it's in the national interest, and if the force that you're using is less than war." why does it matter? %$* 610
well, of course, because the constitution gave congress the power to declare war. %$* 610
so if what you're doing is actual war, then you actually have to go to congress. %$* 610
how do you tell the difference between what's war and what's not war by this president's own metric? %$* 610
well, in libya, the last time he used force without congressional authorization, he said it was because, this is a short term commitment, right? %$* 610
we're not going to be there very long. %$* 610
we're going to get in. %$* 610
we're going to get out. %$* 610
we're going to have a very limited mission, right? %$* 610
just protecting civilians pursuant to a u.n. security council resolution, and there will be minimal risk to americans in any event, right? %$* 610
the problem today is that the conflict against isil in iraq and syria is, even by the president's own metric, war, in a constitutional sense. %$* 610
the president said when he committed troops, when he expanded our operations in iraq and syria, that this is going to take some time. %$* 610
he announced a broad mission. %$* 610
our mission is not to protect particular individuals or even keep the peace. %$* 610
our mission is broadly to destroy and degrade another organization, isil, the "islamic state" as it calls itself. %$* 610
by january of this year, the united states had carried out close to 10,000 airstrikes in the region; we have 7,000 contractors in our employee-- %$* 610
in our employ on the ground; and 4,500 military personnel already serving in the theater. %$* 610
"okay," my opponents will say, "but that's fine." so what matters is not even so much what the president has done in the past. %$* 610
what matters is what works. %$* 610
we need the flexibility. %$* 610
the president needs the ability to respond to new threats, to new dangers. %$* 610
and that does matter. %$* 610
but in this case, that's not what's going on. %$* 610
there has been more than enough time, there remains enough time for congress to authorize the use of force. %$* 610
indeed, the president has gone to congress and asked it to authorize the use of force in the case of isil.there is plenty, further, of strategic cause for congress to authorize force. %$* 610
congressional authorization is an incredibly important signal. %$* 610
it signals our allies that we're serious about the fight. %$* 610
it signals our enemies that we're serious about the fight. %$* 610
and it signals, particularly in a conflict like this, to what our security friends call, "wavering neutrals in the region," right? %$* 610
those folks who looked at what we did in the past conflicts, they looked at abu ghraib, they looked at guantanamo, they said, "i don't buy the united states," and it shows them we're as good as our word. %$* 610
for all of these reasons, the framers thought so; it remains a good idea. %$* 610
you need to vote for the resolution. %$* 610
congress needs to authorize the use of force. %$* 610
thank you. %$* 610
thank you, deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
and our motion is, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization."and here to argue against this motion, please welcome philip bobbitt. %$* 13
he is the herbert wechsler professor of federal jurisprudence at columbia law school, and a distinguished senior lecturer at the university of texas. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, philip bobbitt. %$* 13
i agree. %$* 611
i'm not going to dismiss the text and the history. %$* 611
i'm not going to rely on the practices of the last 60 years. %$* 611
i agree. %$* 611
congress should be on record about this. %$* 611
congress should authorize war against the islamic state. %$* 611
and i believe, and my partner, professor amar, believe that congress has, that the authorization for the use of military force in 2001 empowers the president to use deadly force against the islamic state. %$* 611
now, you may be told that the aumf, as we’ll call it, of 2001 authorized retaliation against al- qaeda for the atrocities on 9/11, and therefore, it can't apply to the islamic state because the islamic state didn't exist in 2001, and furthermore, that since it has distanced itself from the core al-qaeda leadership, it can't be responsible for the 9/11 attack. %$* 611
to see if this is as clinching as it sounds, let's take a close look at the joint resolution adopted by both houses of congress and signed into law by the president that we'll be discussing tonight. %$* 611
that law is not simply about holding an organization responsible for the past attacks on the u.s., but about deterring new attacks. %$* 611
it is not even about one organization, al-qaeda, or about plural groups. %$* 611
the aumf advanced in 2001 provided for the use-- %$* 611
and i will quote-- %$* 611
"of all necessary and appropriate force in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by organizations," plural, “that the president determines authorized the terrorist attacks of september the 11th.” unquote. %$* 611
if the president determines that the use of force against the islamic state is necessary and appropriate in order to prevent future acts of terrorism by the network of which the islamic state was admittedly a part, which had authorized the attacks of 9/11, then congress's language is quite sufficient to authorize the actions the president proposes. %$* 611
to vote for our opponents, you must conclude that there is no rational way the president could make this determination, that there is no conceivable way he could find that action against the islamic state might deter the loose network of shifting alliances that is united in its objective to found an islamist caliphate, and by acts of terror like 9/11, to intimidate the united states from acquiescing in this objective. %$* 611
it is significant that the congress agrees with our view. %$* 611
so, they have recently passed-- %$* 611
as we all know-- %$* 611
legislation appropriating funds for air attacks on the islamic state, which they would scarcely have done if they believed the president could not constitutionally execute the legislation they passed. %$* 611
it is also significant that the federal courts in the guantanamo cases have unanimously accepted the view that the islamic state is an associated force of al-qaeda, bringing the islamic state within the ambit of the charters for the use of force that congress has passed. %$* 611
moreover, there are ample precedents for using congressional authorizations for war to apply to subsequent groups when later hostilities emerge where conflict initially authorized. %$* 611
the most pertinent example is not the last 60 years, but from the philippines war in 1898, in which u.s.forces, having defeated the spanish against whom congress had authorized war, found themselves attacked by philippine insurgents, who had actually fought the spanish. %$* 611
u.s.forces proceeded to wage war against the philippine insurgents without any further congressional authorization, choosing instead to rely on the initial declaration of war against spain. %$* 611
no one doubts that the islamic state emerged out of the conflict in iraq, authorized by the aumf of 2002, nor that it was created as an arm of al-qaeda-- %$* 611
its original name was al- qaeda in mesopotamia-- %$* 611
against whom the aumf of 2001 was directed. %$* 611
there are other examples of albania, croatia, slovakia in world war ii that stand to the principle that fresh authority is not needed if the new belligerent emerges from an originally authorized conflict and wages war against us. %$* 611
finally, it is simply absurd to hold that the islamic state would be free from those pre-existing authorizations on the ground that it has changed its name or denounced its former leaders. %$* 611
while this might make some sort of sense in a world of nation-states, in the wars we are currently fighting, new groups pop up all the time, change their names, denounce their leaders. %$* 611
just two weeks ago boko haram announced it was going to be part of the islamic state. %$* 611
would we really want a rule that required a fresh congressional statute every time a terrorist leader changed his name after he'd attacked us or tweeted an attack on his former allies? %$* 611
congress, the courts, and the president all agree on the constitutional and statutory proposition that professor amar and i are asserting. %$* 611
if you disagree, you must have good constitutional grounds. %$* 611
that's right. %$* 611
in the text, in the structure, in the history, you must find the case law, the historical precedents, the strategic practicality, which counts too-- %$* 611
and only then can you be compelled to disagree. %$* 611
thank you. %$* 13
philip bobbitt. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
you've heard from the first two debaters. %$* 13
and now onto a third. %$* 13
we're going to welcome to the lectern gene healy. %$* 13
he is a vice president of the cato institute and author of "the cult of the presidency: america's dangerous devotion to executive power." he is arguing in support of the motion that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority. %$* 13
please welcome gene healy. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 609
the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, or to put tonight's debate resolution another way, the president does not have power under the constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. %$* 609
you may have heard that second formulation before. %$* 609
it's how candidate obama described the limits of presidential war powers when he was asked about it during campaign 2008.and it came up a lot about three years later when president obama unilaterally launched a seven-month bombing campaign against libya. %$* 609
not only was there no actual or imminent threat to the nation in that case, but 10 days into the bombing, the president's own secretary of defense went on “meet the press” and admitted that libya wasn't a vital interest to the united states. %$* 609
the president took us into our latest war in the middle east, the ongoing conflict against isis, last august. %$* 609
here again there was no imminent threat. %$* 609
"we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland," president obama told the country in his nationally televised address, and yet he waited six months and over 2,000 airstrikes before he got around to sending a draft request for authorization to congress, along with a cover note insisting that “existing statutes provide me with all the authority i need to wage war anyway.” the central basis for that claim, as professor bobbitt notes, is the 2001 aumf, the resolution that congress passed three days after 9/11 empowering the president to take military action against "those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the september 11th attacks, or harbored those who did."now, not exclusively, but principally, obviously, al-qaeda and the taliban. %$* 609
and judging by what the people in congress said about it at the time, the people who passed it certainly didn't think they were committing the united states to open-ended, multi-generational war. %$* 609
now, nearly 14 years later, this war has gone on 10 years longer than world war ii, four years longer than vietnam, and counting. %$* 609
under the 9/11 aumf president obama has launched six times the number of drone strikes as president bush against groups with evermore tenuous and remote connections to the language-- %$* 609
to the resolution's language and original target. %$* 609
two years ago obama officials told the washington post that they were increasingly concerned that the law is being stretched to its legal breaking point. %$* 609
that was before they'd stretched it still further. %$* 609
president obama now argues that the 9/11 aumf allows him to go after-- %$* 609
go to war with groups like isis that have not just distanced themselves from al-qaeda, but have been denounced and excommunicated by al-qaeda. %$* 609
it may even allow, and the theory-- %$* 609
the administration's theory of the 2001 aumf, it may even allow him to go after isis’s offshoots and sympathizers as so-called “associated forces” of a force that al-qaeda refuses to associate with. %$* 609
earlier this month at a senate hearing, president obama's new secretary of defense acknowledged that the resolution may be broad enough to allow the president to wage war in nigeria against boko haram, which recently pledged allegiance to isis on twitter. %$* 609
in fact, the administration's interpretation of the 9/11 aumf is so broad they can't tell you how broad it is. %$* 609
for one thing, who we're at war with is classified. %$* 609
in testimony last may, the pentagon's general counsel told the senate that which groups the administration claims legal authority to target under the aumf, well, that's something that they're "just not prepared to discuss in an open session." meanwhile, obama administration officials admit that there's no end in sight to worldwide war making. %$* 609
the war on terror will go on "at least 10 to 20 years more," which means, i suppose, that in 2032, when we're all filled with excitement about the impending presidential contest between chelsea clinton and george p. bush-- %$* 609
we can rest assured that the winner will get to use the september 2001 aumf as the basis for his or her presidential kill list. %$* 609
this is not how constitutional democracies are supposed to make the most important decision that any society can make. %$* 609
president obama has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, but it's worse than that. %$* 609
the arguments he's advanced will make it even easier for future presidents to do the same. %$* 609
i urge you to vote, "yes," on the motion. %$* 609
thank you. %$* 609
thank you, gene healy. %$* 13
and the motion is that “the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." and here to argue against this motion, please welcome akhil amar. %$* 13
he is sterling professor of law and political science at yale, where he teaches constitutional law at both yale college and yale law school. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, akhil amar. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 612
so you've heard this expression a couple of times from our distinguished opponents, "aumf." let's just slow down a second and hear what the aumf is. %$* 612
it's the authorization of the use of military force. %$* 612
here's the resolution, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." the aumf is a congressional thing. %$* 612
it's a self-described authorization of the use of military force; that is "waging war." sometimes-- %$* 612
you know, i don't know how many of you have kids, but i've got three, and sometimes my wife and i say like, "what part of, 'no,' did you not understand? %$* 612
" what part of the “authorization of the use of military force” are we not understanding here? %$* 612
let's go over, once again, what that statute says, because we've heard, "well, congress didn't intend this and didn't intend that." congress uses words to express its intent. %$* 612
if they didn't want an authorization to be temporally open-ended, you know what they can do? %$* 612
they can put a sunset provision in that authorization that says, "this sunsets after a certain point in time." they did not do that. %$* 612
and they do do that in other laws. %$* 612
see the patriot act. %$* 612
in fact, what they say in the law very explicitly in this authorization is to prevent, quote, "any future attack against the united states by these various organizations.” let me go over once again what it says, "the president”-- %$* 612
the president-- %$* 612
"is authorized to use all”-- %$* 612
what part of all don't you-- %$* 612
"necessary and appropriate force against nations," with an s, "organizations," with an s, "and persons he determines”-- %$* 612
and i think i will concede in brackets-- %$* 612
in good faith and reasonably, on the basis of information that he has that not all of us have in this room, frankly, "that he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons," okay? %$* 612
"in order to prevent any future attack," okay? %$* 612
now, if you know just general legal principles, you can have persons and organizations, who are aiders and abettors after the fact. %$* 612
they're harborers after the fact, and that's what isis is. %$* 612
it's an offshoot of al-qaeda, as you've heard. %$* 612
here's what winning a war actually means: sometimes you smash one organization, and it splinters, and now you have to deal with the splinters, you know? %$* 612
hercules is making some progress when he slices off each of the heads of the hydra, but initially you get two that grow back. %$* 612
but it's the same basic hydra, and you've got to deal with the root. %$* 612
it's the same problem. %$* 612
so-- %$* 612
and the president gets to make this determination, at least if it's in good faith. %$* 612
these, ladies and gentlemen, isil, isis, involve some of the same persons. %$* 612
you have not heard our distinguished opponents deny that, and i'd like to hear if they deny that they're some of the same persons. %$* 612
and that's not fighting everyone around the world at any time. %$* 612
no one in this room is a member-- %$* 612
was a member of al-qaeda, a leader. %$* 612
so it's only certain organizations that have the same persons. %$* 612
isil and isis are using the same tactics, the tactics of terror, as al- qaeda. %$* 612
they have the same murderous purpose, and frankly it's a murderous purpose to murder us, and our ideals, and-- %$* 612
which takes me to the fourth point-- %$* 612
they have the same target, us, u.s. that's u.s., the united states, that's us, small u, small s, no periods. %$* 612
okay? %$* 612
same persons. %$* 612
at least a subset of them. %$* 612
same terror tactics. %$* 612
same murderous purpose. %$* 612
same target. %$* 612
you heard my distinguished colleague, professor bobbitt, channel shakespeare. %$* 612
"what's in a name? %$* 612
" you know, so they-- %$* 612
so they changed their name. %$* 612
are you going to allow the same-- %$* 612
you know, this offshoot entity to escape the clear language of this authorization, which is about preventing future attacks, just because they changed their name? %$* 612
i invoked lincoln earlier. %$* 612
by the way, you know that civil war wasn’t a formal declaration of war back then. %$* 612
but lincoln was surely not exceeding his authorization because-- %$* 612
his constitutional authority because congress actually authorized it-- %$* 612
although not by formal declaration-- %$* 612
in the same way that congress authorized john adams, in the same way that congress authorized thomas jefferson. %$* 612
we don't have to just pick the last 50 years. %$* 612
and john adams is fighting the french. %$* 612
and jefferson is fighting the barbary pirates. %$* 612
and these are not formal, declared wars, but they are congressionally authorized military actions. %$* 612
so, let me-- %$* 612
let me just close with abraham lincoln-- %$* 612
since i invoked shakespeare. %$* 612
and i told you, he's part of our unwritten constitution. %$* 612
there's a reason he's up there on mount rushmore. %$* 612
and you know, he's a very simple, common- sensical fellow who says, "if you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have? %$* 612
" and the answer, ladies and gentlemen, is four. %$* 612
because calling a tail a leg don't make it so. %$* 612
okay? %$* 612
and changing the name doesn't mean that this is any different from the very forces that this authorization of the use of military force was essentially about. %$* 612
thank you very much. %$* 612
thank you, akhil amar. %$* 13
and that concludes opening statements in this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
and now we move on to round 2. in round 2, the debaters address one another in-- %$* 13
directly, and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here at the miller theater at columbia university. %$* 13
we have this motion in front of us: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
the team arguing for this motion-- %$* 13
that the president has gone too far-- %$* 13
deborah pearlstein and gene healy have argued that it's right there in writing. %$* 13
it's in the constitution. %$* 13
congress declares wars, not the president; that this president, president obama, has taken more license with war- making than any president in history; that isil is an enemy in the conventional sense of conventional war, and therefore, all of the normal rules should apply. %$* 13
but presidential actions, like the bombing of libya, amount to one man unilaterally taking the nation to war without-- %$* 13
in some cases-- %$* 13
justification of true threats to the nation, and that this is not how a constitutional democracy makes the most important decisions that it ever has to face. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
akhil amar and philip bobbitt-- %$* 13
are arguing that indeed the president has the authorization to take the war to isil, that it is the same authorization that was given to george bush in 2001 after september 11th to defeat enemies, such as al-qaeda. %$* 13
it was inherited by barack obama; that its elasticity is a matter of practicality, because the enemy changes, and it hasn't changed that much; that in a lot of ways, the guys in isil are the same people, with the same tactics, and the same target-- %$* 13
us-- %$* 13
as the target that was chosen by al-qaeda on september 11th. %$* 13
i want to take that part of the argument to the team that's arguing for the motion and ask them about that notion: that, in fact, what-- %$* 13
the authorization given to george bush in 2001 still applies, primarily because we're still fighting the same guys in the same extended war. %$* 13
do you want take that, deborah pearlstein? %$* 13
sure. %$* 610
so i find the notion, to use the word, absurd. %$* 610
the text of the authorization for the use of force doesn't name them. %$* 610
congress never conceived that isil was the group that they meant to be authorizing force-- %$* 610
again, in part, because isil and even al-qaeda in iraq-- %$* 610
as it used to be called by the united states-- %$* 610
didn't exist in 2001.and this group, just because it once had some association with al-qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it. %$* 610
you know, the united states is an offshoot of great britain in some fundamental way, but i'd like to think, after a certain time and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference-- %$* 610
but do-- %$* 13
between one and another. %$* 610
deborah, do you concede the sameness argument, that they're-- %$* 13
they might be somewhat different people, different name, but that their game is the same? %$* 13
i don't. %$* 610
in fact, it's not just a name. %$* 610
it's a fundamental mission. %$* 610
so, when al-qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, osama bin laden named the united states its primary enemy. %$* 610
he declared war against the united states. %$* 610
he attacked the united states repeatedly. %$* 610
he viewed the united states and its political operations and factions in the middle east as the source of the problem. %$* 610
isil is in essence an apocalyptic cult. %$* 610
they fight the united states today for the same reason that they fight al-qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the united states as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else. %$* 610
in other words, it’s not just the name that’s different, the mission of the group-- %$* 610
okay. %$* 13
let me take that to your opponent. %$* 13
phillip bobbitt, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
sure. %$* 611
the current leader of isil, the islamic state, al-baghdadi, said when he was released from our custody where he'd been for some months, “i'll see you next in new york.” %$* 611

so please welcome to the stage bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hey, bob. %$* 13
hey, bob. %$* 13
so in terms of topicality, well, it looks like-- %$* 13
it looks like since we started thinking about this one, it's becoming even more topical. %$* 13
i mean, what was our thinking in beginning-- %$* 13
deciding to get this one-- %$* 13
this one on to our stage. %$* 13
well, we felt that this was kind of coinciding with the start of school. %$* 1
it was something that was going to be top of mind for a generation of students going to college for the first time, or going back to college. %$* 1
it was going to be of concern to their parents. %$* 1
and it was timely. %$* 1
but i didn't realize quite how timely the particular date was. %$* 1
and now that i do, i think it's just so important that on this day, of all days, we offer the public a debate where they might actually learn something, a debate where people might actually deal with nuanced issues in a respectful manner, where there could be enough discussion about a topic to leave people with an informed view about it. %$* 1
hearing the other side of the story. %$* 13
perhaps. %$* 1
possibly, it's a possibility. %$* 13
we were chatting beforehand about this motion language and that the curiosity of the fact that we're talking about an adjudication process that involves courts and that also involves campuses, which you are saying to me kind of goes to the point of why this is a tough issue. %$* 13
well, this is a very difficult issue. %$* 1
and i'm going to pull some notes out of my pocket, which i don't normally do, but i want to be sure that i'm sort of quoting law accurately. %$* 1
that's not 30 pages of notes, is it? %$* 13
this is not. %$* 1
so, the resolution language, "courts not campuses show decide sexual assault cases," so sexual assault is obviously a legal term. %$* 1
"cases" implies that it's a law case. %$* 1
and the natural thing in our world is that cases are decided by courts and not campuses. %$* 1
so, that would be a kind of a natural supposition. %$* 1
but in fact, the way this topic arises is much broader than the question of legal sexual assault, there’s a much, much broader concept at stake in the kind of conduct that college campuses are trying to regulate. %$* 1
and let me just-- %$* 1
if you'll indulge me for a minute-- %$* 1
let me just explain a little bit the differences between what the law is trying to regulate and what college campuses are trying to regulate. %$* 1
so the new york penal law, when it's dealing with sexual assault, uses words like "penetration," "physical force," "fear of immediate death or physical injury."it's an element of every offense that the act was committed without the consent of the victim. %$* 1
"inability to consent occurs if the victim is mentally incapacitated owing to the influence of a narcotic or intoxicating substance, but only if it was administered to him without his consent and only if the defendant did not know the facts around that, the way the narcotic was administered." so, very tough to prove. %$* 1
corroboration is required so that a person shall not be convicted of any offense solely on the testimony of the victim, unsupported by other evidence. %$* 1
and, all of this has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. %$* 1
and if it’s proved, people are liable for jail sentences of five to 25 years. %$* 1
so this is a very, very serious crime, but it is defined in a very precise way, and it's very hard to prove. %$* 1
in contrast, what the colleges are trying to do in this area is comply with something called title ix, which is a provision of the education act. %$* 1
and it's not a statute. %$* 1
it's not a regulations. %$* 1
it's something called a "dear colleague" letter, which is written by somebody in the-- %$* 1
in the office of the secretary of-- %$* 1
of the department of education, telling schools that they're going to lose their federal funding if they don't comply with this letter. %$* 1
and it sets up some incredibly vague ideas about what's objectionable. %$* 1
"sexual harassment," and i'm quoting, "is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical contact of a sexual nature."so it requires all colleges-- %$* 1
i mean, just reading those words should give you a sense of how vague and general and hard it is to know whether they apply or not to any particular kind of conduct. %$* 1
and they-- %$* 1
it requires all recipients, that is, all people getting federal aid to their universities, public and adopt grievance proceedings for the prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints. %$* 1
so they've lumped together sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault all in one package. %$* 1
well, it sounds pretty tangled. %$* 13
it is pretty tangled. %$* 1
but that's why we have these debaters here. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 1
that's true. %$* 1
to untangle it for us. %$* 13
they’re going to untangle it, but let me just make one further quick point, which is that the standards are incredibly different, the standards that the universities are supposed to apply is just that it's more likely than not that an offense has occurred, they are not required to have counsel as part of these proceedings, they're not required to have an appeal as part of the proceedings, so it's a very different set of standards of what constitutes an offense, a very different kind of standard about what constitutes proof, and very different kinds of conduct covered under these. %$* 1
so it is a very, very tricky area, and i think we are lucky to have four law professors tonight to help us unravel it. %$* 1
let's bring them to the stage. %$* 13
thanks, everybody. %$* 13
bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
so throughout the evening, as i mentioned, we're a podcast, and we exist as a radio broadcast. %$* 13
as i said, i would love to have the audience that hears this to know that you're here, in part because you're going to be asking questions and you act as our judges also. %$* 13
so as i said, you feel free to applaud points and make your views known. %$* 13
but from time to time, i'm just going to ask you to spontaneously applaud to help with the atmospherics, and this is one of those times. %$* 13
i want to ask you-- %$* 13
so for generations, colleges and universities have known how to handle violations like student plagiarism. %$* 13
they hold a sort of court, a tribunal, and they hand out penalties if warranted, suspension or expulsion. %$* 13
but what if the violation is something like sexual assault on campus? %$* 13
in that case, should it again be the school who is deciding who did what and handing out the punishment, which might be expulsion or suspension, or should the victims-- %$* 13
is it preferable for the victims, advisable for the victims to be going to the police and reporting a crime and seeking prosecution of their assailants, possibly for rape, especially, however, knowing that, that route so often results in justice denied? %$* 13
well, because of what's happening right now on college campuses across the united states, this is a topical and lively debate. %$* 13
so let's have it right here, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters on our stage who will argue for and against this motion, which once again is, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases."as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
again, the motion, "courts, not campuses, should be deciding sexual assault cases." please welcoming-- %$* 13
please welcome to the team arguing for the motion, jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
and, jed, you are a professor at yale law school. %$* 13
you publish and write on constitutional and criminal law. %$* 13
you had a piece in the new york times op-ed page that said that this should be a courtroom issue. %$* 13
at that time, you were rebutted in a statement by-- %$* 13
signed by 80 yale law students. %$* 13
does that honestly represent to you-- %$* 13
do you feel, the majority of you among students on this issue? %$* 13
well, i actually don't think so. %$* 317
no. %$* 317
but look, this is an issue that everybody feels very strongly and personally about. %$* 317
i'm the father of two girls on college campuses. %$* 317
i feel strongly about it too. %$* 317
that's why it's so important to have debates like this one. %$* 317
and we will. %$* 13
and tell us who your partner is, please. %$* 13
my partner is professor of law at harvard university, jeannie suk. %$* 317
ladies and gentlemen, jeannie suk. %$* 13
so, jeannie, as jed said-- %$* 13
jed says you're a professor at harvard law, which is also having-- %$* 13
you know, wrestling with this issue right now. %$* 13
harvard has its division on the issue. %$* 13
and you are among 28 harvard law professors who issued a statement opposing the university's new policy and procedures on sexual violence. %$* 13
now, without getting into your argument yet, just share with us why this is an issue, do you think, on which smart people can disagree so passionately? %$* 13
they feel very personally about it. %$* 318
it's also very political for them. %$* 318
and it's also about the institutions that they inhabit, so that's a recipe for very strong feelings and very strong disagreements. %$* 318
some of which i think will come out tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeannie suk, and the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and that motion, again, is courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
we have two debaters arguing against it. %$* 13
please welcome first michelle anderson. %$* 13
michelle anderson, you are dean at cuny school of law and a leading scholar on rape law. %$* 13
right now you are working with the department of defense, trying, actually, to help the department of defense define rape-- %$* 13
which, it might be a surprise to some people to know that rape needs a definition. %$* 13
but does that reveal how complex this issue is? %$* 13
i think it does. %$* 319
over the past decade, the uniform code of military justice has had three versions of a definition of rape and sexual assault. %$* 319
so, this is a very complex issue. %$* 319
and your partner is? %$* 13
the brilliant stephen schulhofer. %$* 319
ladies and gentlemen, stephen schulhofer. %$* 13
stephen, you're a professor at the new york university school of law. %$* 13
you're the author of "unwanted sex," considered one of the most important books on rape law in the last 20 years. %$* 13
we're going to be hearing this term "title ix" a lot tonight. %$* 13
it's important to the debate. %$* 13
so, do us the favor, taking us-- %$* 13
to two sentences to explain why title ix is relevant to this debate. %$* 13
sure, title ix is the federal law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funds to prevent racial and sexual harassment of their students. %$* 320
and that's why colleges have an obligation to address racial and sexual violence against students on their campuses. %$* 320
so, title ix is-- %$* 13
and i just want to ask you to face towards the mic just for the radio broadcast-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 320
you're a little bit off. %$* 13
no problem. %$* 13
so, title ix is the reason, really, that this issue has become a campus issue. %$* 13
it's a part of it. %$* 320
yes. %$* 320
a big part of it. %$* 13
well, ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion, which is courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
and i remind you, this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be a winner and a loser as these teams try to argue in such a way that they persuade you to vote for their side. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice-- %$* 13
once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most between the two results in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
it's the difference between the two votes. %$* 13
let's register the first vote. %$* 13
if you can go to those keypads at your seat-- %$* 13
just pay attention to numbers 1, 2, and 3.and here's how it works. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion as you see it on the screen, push number 1.that means you're with this team. %$* 13
push number 1.if you disagree, push number 2.and if you're undecided, which is a perfectly reasonable position to be in, push number 3.you hold down the key for a few seconds until you see the number register on the top. %$* 13
if you made an incorrect vote, just correct yourself. %$* 13
you'll see the number will correct, and we'll lock it out in a few seconds. %$* 13
i may-- %$* 13
we're on new technology tonight, so i may need to note that we're good. %$* 13
we're locked out? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
good. %$* 13
let's move on. %$* 13
so, i said we'd go in three rounds. %$* 13
and we're going to start with round 1. starting round 1-- %$* 13
our motion is this: courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
in round 1, the debaters have uninterrupted addresses from the lectern. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and first to go up to the lectern, i'd like to welcome jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
he is the robert r.slaughter professor of law at yale law school. %$* 13
he is arguing for the motion, courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 317
and welcome to the second most important debate happening in america tonight. %$* 317
it's a-- %$* 317
it's a deep honor to be here, and i want to thank the organizers and also you, the audience, for coming. %$* 317
so, yes, one of my daughters is a college sophomore. %$* 317
the other just started law school. %$* 317
i'm very concerned about keeping our campuses safe from sexual assault. %$* 317
that's a goal that everyone on this stage shares. %$* 317
but the way to achieve that goal is not by having colleges conduct rape trials when they're incompetent to do it. %$* 317
i'm about to use some strong words. %$* 317
i wouldn't do it except that this is the reality, and we need to face it. %$* 317
as the result of campus sexual assault trials, actual rapists all over the country are going free to rape again, while innocent people-- %$* 317
it's impossible to know how many. %$* 317
but i'm talking about people who haven't committed any sexual assault at all-- %$* 317
are being found guilty and having their lives wrecked by an error ridden, unreliable process that's filled with conflicts of interest and violations of due process, all of it covered by a thick layer of non-transparency. %$* 317
now, my partner, jeannie, is going to cover the serious due process violations, so i'm going to talk to you about the basic competency and neutrality and transparency issues. %$* 317
but there's something extremely important to both jeannie and me. %$* 317
i want to say it first, that this is not, for us, a debate between the rights of the accused versus the rights of the victim. %$* 317
an incompetent process produces errors on both sides. %$* 317
it's unfair to both victims and the accused. %$* 317
the errors run in both directions, and i will give you examples of those in a moment. %$* 317
but first, just some quick background on how we got to where we are today. %$* 317
in 2011, the federal government sent a letter to every college and university in the country telling them that if they didn't start trying rape cases they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding penalties, and forcing us to comply with a set of procedures dictated by the government, including, for example, lowering the standard of proof. %$* 317
now, i'm sure this letter was well intentioned. %$* 317
but the problem is that college trials totally lack the necessary expertise, neutrality and transparency. %$* 317
let me start with competence. %$* 317
the primary forensic tool in a rape case-- %$* 317
you've probably heard of it-- %$* 317
it's a rape kit. %$* 317
it's basically a medical forensic examination of the victim. %$* 317
now, most college personnel don't even know what a rape kit is. %$* 317
or say a woman believes she was the victim of a date rape drug. %$* 317
say she was the victim. %$* 317
that kind of case requires a laboratory toxicology result. %$* 317
that's how you make that case. %$* 317
most colleges do not run such laboratories and can't do that. %$* 317
a recent college rape case was decided by a panel of three judges, one person from engineering, one from food services, and one foreign exchange student. %$* 317
in another case, an accused male student was essentially acquitted not because he was found innocent, but because he broke down at the hearing and admitted his alcoholism problem. %$* 317
the woman accuser was stunned to see her rapist sitting in class with her the next week. %$* 317
at stanford, the teaching manual for rape judges includes an article saying that if the accused act-- %$* 317
if the accused acts as if he's the victim, that's an indicator of guilt. %$* 317
another indicator of guilt is if he, quote, "acts logical and persuasive." this kind of-- %$* 317
i'm not kidding. %$* 317
this kind of incompetent decision making is leading to miscarriages of justice of a kind you wouldn't imagine in america. %$* 317
and how about impartiality? %$* 317
in our courts, we have a process we've worked out for centuries to ensure that our judges and juries are disinterested, that they don't know the parties, don't know anybody who does know the parties, that they're not subject to rumors and pressures. %$* 317
in college rape trials, it's the opposite. %$* 317
these are people from the same community. %$* 317
they are subject to pressures. %$* 317
they sometimes know the parties. %$* 317
they sometimes know people who do know the parties. %$* 317
athlete-- %$* 317
athletic coaches decide if athletes committed rape. %$* 317
students decide cases involving students. %$* 317
now, again, these conflicts, they hurt victims and accused alike. %$* 317
in some cases, colleges have a huge incentive to sweep rape cases under the rug, to cover them up. %$* 317
and that can lead to guilty people being found innocent. %$* 317
in other cases, it's the opposite. %$* 317
especially today, colleges are feeling a lot of pressure under threat from the federal government to show how seriously they take these cases and to make an example. %$* 317
and that can lead to innocent people being found guilty, to be expelled, and if their names leak out, to be branded with a stigma that they have no way to ever clear themselves of. %$* 317
compare this to what happens when a murder takes place on a college campus. %$* 317
we don't hold campus homicide trials. %$* 317
we all expect the police, the da, the fbi and the courts to take charge. %$* 317
rape is a crime as serious as homicide. %$* 317
it's not like plagiarism or cheating on an exam. %$* 317
that's the kind of thing college disciplinary panels are good at. %$* 317
we should treat rape with the same seriousness as we do other major crimes. %$* 317
but worst of all, i haven't even gotten to the worst thing of all. %$* 317
what happens when the college rape trial works just the way it's supposed to work; when an actual rapist is found guilty? %$* 317
what happens next? %$* 317
let me ask you a question. %$* 317
if you had proof that somebody in your neighborhood had committed an act of rape, what was the-- %$* 317
what's the worst possible thing you could do? %$* 317
here's the worst thing: push that person out of your neighborhood, but never tell anybody else what happened. %$* 317
keep his name confidential. %$* 317
that literally is what colleges do in these cases. %$* 317
they expel the student but keep his identity a total secret because the college process, unlike a court, has no transparency. %$* 317
it's all covered with confidentiality. %$* 317
and i can't stress how important this is. %$* 317
some empirical studies out there have suggested that up to 90 percent of college rapes are being committed by fewer than 5 percent of college men, a relative handful of serial rapists, averaging over six rapes each. %$* 317
yet colleges, when they catch these serial rapists, simply push them out of their neighborhood, leaving them free to commit sexual assault elsewhere, their secret kept safe within the college bureaucracy. %$* 317
that's why we need courts to handle these cases. %$* 317
now finally, it's critical to acknowledge that the courts are far from perfect, the police are far from perfect. %$* 317
too often in the past they have failed victims of sexual assault. %$* 317
we can do better. %$* 317
we have to do better. %$* 317
and in the end, it's not courts or colleges, one or the other. %$* 317
that's a kind of debating artificiality. %$* 317
we all know that both have a role to play. %$* 317
there's a huge amount colleges can do, but they should be focused on education and prevention, which they can do well, not on adjudication which they can't. %$* 317
ideally, we bridge the gap. %$* 317
get colleges and police working together. %$* 317
that's what i've advocated, and it's happening. %$* 317
here in new york, there's just been the creation of a special sexual assault enforcement unit, first of its kind in the country. %$* 317
it's specifically designed to go out and work with both colleges and local police to help them get together and do their jobs better. %$* 317
but the primary responsibility for investigating and trying rape cases has to be with police and courts. %$* 317
that's what we're asking you to vote for. %$* 317
a vote for our side of this debate is a vote that not campuses, but courts should be the primary place where rape trials are conducted. %$* 317
and we urge you-- %$* 317
to vote that way. %$* 317
thank you. %$* 13
to vote that way. %$* 317
thank you, jed. %$* 13
i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
i gave you-- %$* 13
gave you a little bit over, but-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
the motion is "courts not campuses should decide sexual assault cases." and our next debater will be speaking against this motion. %$* 13
please welcome michelle anderson. %$* 13
she is dean at cuny school of law. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michelle anderson. %$* 13
courts should decide sexual assault cases when a victim reports to the police, when the police take it seriously and investigate, when a prosecutor takes it seriously and pursues it, and the case finally lands in a court of law. %$* 319
in these circumstances, courts should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 319
no one disagrees. %$* 319
the only thing this debate is about is between two commas, "not campuses." the resolution strips jurisdiction from campuses to also decide sexual assault cases. %$* 319
that's what we're talking about tonight. %$* 319
now, colleges and universities exist to generate and transmit knowledge. %$* 319
and they cannot do that job unless they have a safe learning environment in which to do it. %$* 319
they also cannot single out sexual assault cases and push them to the criminal courts, unlike all the other cases they deal with, without harming the learning environment and without violating the civil rights of students. %$* 319
my colleague, stephen schulhofer will talk about the problems that happen when cases are pushed to the criminal law involuntarily. %$* 319
for now, i'll just note that there's a reason why 95 percent of sexual assault victims on campus never report to the police. %$* 319
they do not believe that justice will be served. %$* 319
a college student reported having been raped to the new york city police department. %$* 319
the officer scoffed. %$* 319
"you invited him into your dorm room. %$* 319
that's not the legal definition of rape." another officer chimed in. %$* 319
"for every single rape i've had, i've had 20 reports that are total bullshit."that's not from 1970.that story is from 2014.the fact is that bias against victims of sexual assault has a well-documented, 200 year history in the criminal justice system. %$* 319
but even when the system harbors no bias whatsoever, campuses must be able to decide sexual assault cases. %$* 319
courts and campuses have different interests in these cases and different remedies. %$* 319
let me explain. %$* 319
when a campus sexual assault happens, a victim needs immediate safety and protection. %$* 319
campuses can take protective measures to ensure a safe educational environment; stagger classes, move someone from a dorm, issue reprimands, suspend students. %$* 319
these remedies are not available in the court. %$* 319
the university's role is unavoidable because campuses must preserve students' ability to learn. %$* 319
since the early part of the 19th century, colleges and universities have always disciplined students independent of the criminal law. %$* 319
they've had to. %$* 319
throughout time, students incite riots, they assault, they plagiarize, they harass. %$* 319
some of these acts are criminal, some are not. %$* 319
but just to clarify, campuses are not prosecuting criminal charges in trials. %$* 319
they're pursuing violations of their own disciplinary codes, which do not lead to criminal convictions or imprisonment. %$* 319
and colleges cannot wait around to see if the police are interested in the case. %$* 319
let me give you an example. %$* 319
in 2013 a college fraternity hazing ritual in pennsylvania ended in the death of a pledge by blunt force trauma to the head. %$* 319
the coroner ruled the death a homicide, but the prosecutor did not pursue charges until monday, almost two years later. %$* 319
now, the university had an independent interest in the case. %$* 319
it pursued immediate disciplinary action against the students who hazed and killed the other student. %$* 319
and it suspended them. %$* 319
now, fraternity hazing and homicide are serious crimes, just like rape is a serious crime, but no one in that case said, "oh, the courts should be the only one to handle the case. %$* 319
the colleges should get out of the way." whether or not criminal charges ever emerge in a case, colleges must decide cases to maintain a safe learning environment, even more so with sexual assault. %$* 319
title ix is a federal civil rights statute that prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions. %$* 319
and campus sexual assault is a form of discrimination that denies a victim an equal education. %$* 319
many sexual assault victims suffer serious consequences, depression, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, social withdrawal. %$* 319
these reactions impair their ability to attend class and focus, to pass their classes, to maintain their time in school, to remain in school. %$* 319
as a result, the united states department of education's office for civil rights requires schools to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual violence. %$* 319
it requires equal treatment of accuser and accused and demands adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of complaints. %$* 319
since 2011, campuses have begun pursuing these cases in earnest. %$* 319
most colleges are working to implement title ix in a fair and equitable way. %$* 319
you don't hear about them. %$* 319
some campuses are failing, however. %$* 319
they're either denying victims their rights under title ix to an equitable education or they're actually violating students' due process during the disciplinary proceedings in ways that title ix does not require and the constitution will not stand. %$* 319
in these later cases, students are suing, as you heard. %$* 319
where colleges have gone wrong, these young men are winning. %$* 319
and these process issues can be worked out intelligently through the courts without taking a meat cleaver to the problem and abolishing or cutting off campus jurisdiction entirely. %$* 319
let's circle back to the differences between the criminal justice system and title ix quickly. %$* 319
the criminal justice system is focused on punishment, incarceration, retribution. %$* 319
title ix by contrast is a civil rights statute. %$* 319
and like most civil rights statutes, it's focused on equality, in this case, educational equality. %$* 319
the criminal justice system cannot insure equality, and it cannot remedy inequality. %$* 319
campuses have to insure equality. %$* 319
they must provide a safe learning environment to generate and transmit knowledge. %$* 319
now, i want to end by noting that this debate resolution is actually worse than the house republican bill that is pending right now in congress with the orwellian title, "the safe campus act." that bill would prohibit campuses from investigating sexual assault unless the victim reports to the police, and it's being heavily promoted by fraternities. %$* 319
the bill has received near universal opposition from groups that work with actual sexual assault victims as well as opposition from many groups that represent colleges and universities, like the association of american universities. %$* 319
the american council on education has expressed grave reservation about any legislation that would limit our ability to insure a safe campus. %$* 319
the effect of this resolution is to eviscerate colleges' ability to insure a safe campus. %$* 319
it would also violate students' civil rights, and it has to be wrong. %$* 319
please vote, "no." thank you. %$* 319
thank you, michelle anderson. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, fighting it out over this motion, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." you've heard the first two opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
debating for this motion, we're welcoming jeannie suk, professor of law at harvard law school. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeannie suk. %$* 13
i think it's important for us to see that tonight's debate is not just about courts versus campuses. %$* 318
and it's not just about sexual assault. %$* 318
it is a debate about the equality of men and women in our society. %$* 318
in college, i was a rape counselor and an activist, and i've spent my entire life as a feminist on campuses. %$* 318
i have a daughter and a son. %$* 318
and i was optimistic to see colleges take sexual assault more seriously than they had in the past. %$* 318
but the disaster we have seen unfolding around us has made me lose faith. %$* 318
my points tonight will focus on fairness, process, and the connection to equality. %$* 318
what campuses are doing under pressure from the department of education is hurting the cause of gender equality. %$* 318
campus tribunals use procedures that lack basic fairness and often reach inaccurate outcomes. %$* 318
what happens? %$* 318
you're told there's a sexual misconduct complaint against you. %$* 318
but they don't say what it's about or show you the complaint. %$* 318
they don't tell you the evidence or the facts that they're gathering, who the witnesses are, or what they've said. %$* 318
if you're allowed to bring an attorney, which you might not be, your lawyer is barred from speaking. %$* 318
if they give you a live hearing, which they may not, you can't question the accuser or witnesses. %$* 318
people who weren't even there are asked to give opinions on what happened. %$* 318
terribly leading questions are asked. %$* 318
and when your attorney objects, she is told that if she speaks again, she'll be ejected. %$* 318
after you're found responsible and suspended, they don't give you a copy of the investigative report, saying that they can't because of student privacy. %$* 318
the investigation and the adjudication may be handled by the same person, and the appeal is to that person's boss. %$* 318
so, everyone is invested in defending the previous actions of the school. %$* 318
when you appeal, you're told you can't challenge the panel's factual findings. %$* 318
and all this is happening because if you're not found guilty, the school fears that the department of education will open an investigation that would cost a lot of money to deal with and jeopardize its federal funding. %$* 318
in just the past three months, no fewer than five different courts have ruled for students on claims that their school used unfair procedures, including things that i've just described. %$* 318
the shocking disregard for what americans know are essentials of fair process deeply harms the cause of taking sexual violence seriously. %$* 318
it reinforces society's skepticism toward rape victims. %$* 318
it causes everyone to doubt that men disciplined for sexual assault are actually guilty. %$* 318
that aggravates the serious problem that we all want to address. %$* 318
and it harms the fight for gender equality. %$* 318
to make matters worse, many schools are now stretching the concept of what sexual assault is far beyond reasonable recognition. %$* 318
if you have sexual contact without an explicit agreement for every stage of a sexual interaction, that might be considered non-consensual. %$* 318
it's a great idea to make sure that each partner is excited about going forward, but move from kissing to touching without pausing for an explicit agreement-- %$* 318
and it can be sexual assault, even if the other person is equally participating in it. %$* 318
some schools even define consent to mean not only affirmative, but enthusiastic-- %$* 318
even "creative" and "imaginative" agreement. %$* 318
it may be funny, but anything else is sexual assault. %$* 318
it's obvious that sex with a person incapacitated by alcohol is rape. %$* 318
that is obvious. %$* 318
but schools are now disciplining students when the sexual contact is under the influence of alcohol. %$* 318
all this means that most sexual encounters are violating the rules. %$* 318
so, when one person is kicked out for this and branded a rapist, it feels arbitrary to both men and to women. %$* 318
it is truly bizarre to lump these cases together with rapes and treat them as sexual assaults. %$* 318
yet, these are most of the cases that colleges are adjudicating today. %$* 318
this came about because of a desire to protect women from coercion. %$* 318
the idea was that men should seek permission, not just wait for women to object to sex. %$* 318
but schools are sending all the wrong messages about women's capacity to be equal, mature, and independent. %$* 318
we can date these ideas to about 1880.women are timid; women are fragile. %$* 318
in the name of protecting college women and making campuses safe, schools are signaling loudly that they do not see women as capable. %$* 318
i don't want my daughter educated to think of herself that way. %$* 318
we need to refocus on what's wrong with sexual violence and refuse these ancient ideas of women's incapacity. %$* 318
watered-down procedures and overly broad definitions of non-consent make a mockery of a very serious problem and dishonor victims. %$* 318
our opponents must convince you that a rape on campus is different from a rape anywhere else. %$* 318
it is not. %$* 318
criminal sexual conduct anywhere deserves criminal response. %$* 318
and our opponents want you to accept that a civil rights option means that it's okay to have lesser procedures. %$* 318
even if the stakes were civil, the process must be fair, and the stakes are effectively criminal. %$* 318
there is, in fact, so much that campuses should do. %$* 318
it's disturbing to see the bulk of resources going to pseudo investigations and trials. %$* 318
schools should direct those resources to working with law enforcement. %$* 318
the safety measures that michelle was talking about, those do not necessarily go hand in hand with an investigation and adjudication, a decision about the responsibility and guilt of a party for committing a crime. %$* 318
you can take safety measures, and campuses do all the time, without having pseudo criminal trials. %$* 318
schools can engage in rape education, they can address alcohol consumption, and they can work hard to support victims. %$* 318
the answer to shame or stigma about sexual assault is not a campus tribunal mired in secrecy and severe conflicts of interest that is the confidence of nobody. %$* 318
we're going to look back on this period as a mass panic when many people together lost their ability to think clearly about sexual assault and squandered opportunities for promoting gender equality. %$* 318
campuses should not do shoddily what our courts have been designed over generations to do; decide questions of responsibility and guilt for a crime based on evidence. %$* 318
you should not accept it. %$* 318
you should vote for the motion. %$* 318
courts, not campuses should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 318
thank you, jeannie suk. %$* 13
and that is the motion, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." and here, making his statement against the motion, is stephen schulhofer. %$* 13
he is the robert b.mckay professor of law at new york university school of law. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, stephen schulhofer. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 320
courts are certainly finding due process violations all over the place. %$* 320
a lot of colleges have really botched this problem. %$* 320
but i'm very surprised to hear professor suk cite that as a reason for precluding campus discipline in all these cases. %$* 320
we don't shut down the criminal courts just because appellate courts are finding due process violations in criminal trials. %$* 320
and that happens a lot. %$* 320
so, these decisions show that the system is working. %$* 320
the department of education has overreached. %$* 320
many colleges have overreached, and courts are pushing back. %$* 320
the question we have to decide-- %$* 320
and we all agree that many colleges have done a very poor job. %$* 320
the question that we're debating is whether to fix the problem by requiring the colleges to do better or whether to prevent all campuses from deciding these cases no matter how careful they are. %$* 320
the resolution would make a criminal complaint the victim's only option, even when she doesn't want to go through the stress of the criminal process herself and even when she doesn't want to impose that on a classmate who may have mistreated her, but she doesn't want to see that classmate convicted of a crime. %$* 320
taking away the option of a campus remedy is obviously bad for sexual assault victims. %$* 320
i don't think there's any possible question about that. %$* 320
and what people are missing here is that sending all these cases to the criminal courts is going to work out very badly for the accused students as well. %$* 320
suppose a student claims that one of her classmates pushed her onto a sofa, ignored her protests and penetrated her? %$* 320
if a campus panel accepts her story, her classmate might be suspended or even expelled. %$* 320
that could have life-altering consequences. %$* 320
but expulsion is nothing compared to the impact of a criminal conviction for a sex offense. %$* 320
the resolution seems to assume that a criminal conviction requires very clear proof. %$* 320
the reality is actually not so reassuring. %$* 320
trial lawyers know that proof beyond a reasonable doubt isn't all it's cracked up to be. %$* 320
victim testimony no longer requires any corroboration or any proof of physical coercion. %$* 320
if the complainant testifies that she said no, and the jury believes her, that's enough. %$* 320
that is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. %$* 320
of course, the jury has to be unanimous to convict. %$* 320
but it also has to be unanimous to acquit. %$* 320
that's one reason why prosecutors typically file multiple charges, from rape down to sexual contact, attempted contact and maybe a few more. %$* 320
so some jurors may have doubts, others don't. %$* 320
and you typically see a compromised verdict. %$* 320
jurors convict on a minor charge, not even realizing that their verdict can still trigger a harsh sentence. %$* 320
but it gets worse. %$* 320
most criminal cases end in a plea bargain. %$* 320
and one reason is that a rape conviction can mean more than 15 years in prison. %$* 320
if the prosecutor will accept a plea to attempted rape or sexual contact, the sentence drops to only a year or two in jail. %$* 320
that's a hard offer to refuse, even if the chance of conviction on that top count is only 20 or 30 percent. %$* 320
so technically, you can't get a criminal conviction on a mere preponderance of the evidence. %$* 320
but if the odds of a 15-year sentence are 50/50, that becomes a pretty strong reason to plead guilty to the lesser offense. %$* 320
and bingo, the student who might have faced discipline in a college proceeding, might have been required to change his dorm or even leave school for a semester. %$* 320
that student is now getting jail time and a criminal record without having any court hear any evidence at all. %$* 320
that's the reality for the great majority of cases in our criminal courts. %$* 320
what about less serious cases? %$* 320
suppose a young man stares at a sophomore in his calculus class, and he keeps making comments about her body? %$* 320
one day, he grabs her butt in the hallway outside of class. %$* 320
that is sexual assault. %$* 320
but sending a contact case like that to the police normally means complete inaction. %$* 320
i hope that's not the resolution's hidden agenda, a world where a lesser sexual assault allegations aren't pursued. %$* 320
but anyone supporting the allegation for that reason is going to get a rude surprise if it were adopted, because if das didn't pursue these cases, which is what usually happens now, how can colleges respond to disruption and sexual harassment? %$* 320
it's not clear to me what the supporters of this resolution have in mind. %$* 320
when you put thousands of adolescents together with raging hormones, poor judgment and easy access to alcohol, some of them are going to be rude and aggressive. %$* 320
you can talk about prevention programs, and i'm in favor of them too. %$* 320
but misconduct in that environment is going to happen. %$* 320
and how exactly is a college supposed to respond to stupid, boorish behavior, which is going to happen? %$* 320
could the college suspend the student for his rude comments because that's not a crime, but not be allowed to suspend him for actually groping her? %$* 320
it doesn't make any sense. %$* 320
but otherwise, unless the da pursues the case, there couldn't be any sanction at all. %$* 320
and if the college can't discipline its students directly, it will have to pressure police and local prosecutors to press criminal charges. %$* 320
so students who would never face the criminal courts today, adolescents guilty of immaturity and poor judgment would find themselves with a criminal record. %$* 320
no one should want that. %$* 320
but colleges will have to insist on prosecution because they'd have no other basis for imposing sanctions. %$* 320
i think professor suk said, well, of course, the college can take some action. %$* 320
but does that mean the college is going to be taking action without deciding what happened? %$* 320
that's a kind of odd situation if you're opposing-- %$* 320
if you're supporting the resolution that colleges can't decide these cases, but they can take action without deciding the case, that's even worse than the situation we have now. %$* 320
and i haven't even mentioned sex offender registration. %$* 320
federal statute called sorna establishes a national registry with a current address, place of employment and photograph of every convicted sex offender. %$* 320
and it's readily available on the internet, and it's a federal felony for a sex offender to fail to notify local police within three days of every change in residence. %$* 320
people assume these laws only apply to predators who abuse little children, but they cover all sex offenses, even low-level misdemeanors. %$* 320
so this resolution would be a disaster, not only for colleges, but for accused students. %$* 320
they would get less due process in the criminal courts, and we'd see more convictions with consequences far more severe than a college disciplinary record. %$* 320
so that's why it's very important to vote against this resolution. %$* 320
thank you. %$* 320
thank you, stephen schulhofer. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, the members of our live audience here in new york city. %$* 13
our motion is this, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." the team arguing for the motion, jed rubenfeld and jeannie suk, have argued that campuses just are not up to the task, they are not competent, they are not transparent, they are not impartial, they tend to want to sweep these issues under the rug, that they water down procedures, and that sexual assault is essentially losing its meanings as under college juridical processes the definition of sexual assault moves further and further away from the conventional sense of rape. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, michelle anderson and stephen schulhofer, have told us that, first of all, the courts have been terrible historically in adjudicating cases of rape, regardless of whether the victim is a college student or not, that women do not believe that they will get justice by going towards that system, also, however, that colleges have responsibility for the safety of their students, and that legally under title ix they have a responsibility to guarantee equality of education for their students, and that sexual assault is a form of discrimination. %$* 13
it, therefore, is illegal, therefore, is the college's business. %$* 13

and now i would like to introduce the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
welcome. %$* 1
it’s good to have you here. %$* 1
my role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. %$* 1
so, "china does capitalism better than america.” capitalism is the polar opposite of communism, so how can communist china be said to do capitalism better than america? %$* 1
it’s because china is communist in name only. %$* 1
in most of the ways that matter, the chinese economy is a model of capitalism. %$* 1
firms and individuals are largely free to buy the labor technology and raw materials they need to produce the products they want in open competition with others and to sell them at whatever prices the market will bear. %$* 1
if you include government-controlled firms, goods produced in a market system account for a substantially larger share of china’s output than they do in america. %$* 1
capitalism requires capital to invest, and over the past 30 years, china has saved nearly half of its total output and has invested most of those savings in capital assets-- %$* 1
plants, machinery, infrastructure, and the like. %$* 1
in contrast, the american savings rates have been puny, only recently reaching 6 percent of total production. %$* 1
and the promise of capitalism is that by allowing individuals and firms the freedom to act, resources will be allocated efficiently and the wealth and consumption of most people in the society will grow. %$* 1
china has done a phenomenal job of keeping that promise. %$* 1
over the past 30 years, its economy has grown approximately tenfold while america’s has barely doubled. %$* 1
in what respects then does america do capitalism better? %$* 1
clearly, the rule of law is much more developed here. %$* 1
property rights are more secure, and we encourage innovation by protecting intellectual property. %$* 1
as a result, the american economy is far more innovative. %$* 1
the googles and facebooks and apples of the world are american companies. %$* 1
nothing comparable has come from china. %$* 1
we permit individuals to move freely in search of jobs and opportunities. %$* 1
for hundreds of millions of rural chinese, there is no such freedom. %$* 1
corruption and abuse of power by government officials is far more prevalent in china. %$* 1
and crony capitalism, which is certainly an aspect of american life, is absolutely rife in china. %$* 1
as usual, there is a lot to be said on both sides. %$* 1
and in the final analysis, this debate is not just about economics but about which system, american democratic capitalism or chinese state capitalism, will be the model that developing countries around the world admire and seek to emulate. %$* 1
we have an outstanding panel of experts tonight, and it’s my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosencranz for making these possible. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: "china does capitalism better than america.” well, perception can say a lot, and in a recent poll, 53 percent of americans identified china as the world’s leading financial power. %$* 13
only 33 percent said the u.s.is number one. %$* 13
guess what? %$* 13
the u.s.is still number one. %$* 13
the 53 percent who say that china is first are wrong. %$* 13
or are they simply early? %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
welcome to another debate from intelligence squared u.s.our motion is "china does capitalism better than america.”we have four superbly qualified debaters, two teams of two who will argue for this motion and against this motion. %$* 13
we go in three rounds of debate. %$* 13
then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one team wins. %$* 13
our debaters, each connected in his own way to the china story: orville schell, who heads the center for u.s.-china relations at the asia society. %$* 13
your partner is peter schiff who heads euro pacific capital and who has advised ron paul. %$* 13
on the side arguing against the motion that china does capitalism better than america, ian bremmer, founder and president of eurasia group. %$* 13
and your partner minxin pei, professor of government at claremont mckenna college. %$* 13
schell, many hats on your head. %$* 13
you are a journalist and now an in-house thinker at the asia society. %$* 13
you were coming and going to china already 30 years ago when doing such a thing here was seen as really beyond exotic, and then before that as an undergraduate at harvard, you studied far eastern history. %$* 13
so, since you were a teenager, china has counted for you. %$* 13
what sparked this interest for you in the first place? %$* 13
well, paradoxically, i think it was the fact that you couldn’t go there, and that lent a kind of a quality to it that was somewhat mysterious and begged effort to bridge that gap. %$* 621
is that fun over now? %$* 13
no, because china still is a fickle mistress and a very difficult place to finally divine. %$* 621
all right. %$* 13
your debating partner is peter schiff. %$* 13
peter is ceo of euro pacific capital. %$* 13
and peter, you advised ron paul in 2008, and talk about being right early. %$* 13
you called the u.s.housing bubble long before most people even saw it coming. %$* 13
and you’re a guy who makes predictions, and you speak the language of inevitability and you don’t give yourself a lot of room to back away in case you turn out to be wrong. %$* 13
but on china-u.s., what if you turn out to be wrong? %$* 13
well, first of all, in fairness to congressman ron paul, he really didn’t need my advice. %$* 622
he should be giving advice to his opponents. %$* 622
but as far as china, being wrong in what respect? %$* 622
are you talking about my investments in china? %$* 622
for example. %$* 13
yeah, you know, i think that china’s story is unfolding, and i think there is tremendous opportunity for investors to make money as china continues on its journey towards capitalism. %$* 622
i think they are abandoning some of the ideas of the past, not necessarily in favor of what america is today. %$* 622
hopefully maybe more what america used to be in the past. %$* 622
but if i’m wrong, if the political winds blow in a different direction and china doesn’t live up to the potential that i think it has, i’ve got investments all around the world. %$* 622
it’s not only china. %$* 622
that’s a relief. %$* 13
but-- %$* 622
thank you peter schiff. %$* 13
i just want to bring it over to the other side. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america.” and ian bremmer, you are arguing against that motion. %$* 13
ian, you went to college when you were 16. you won a macarthur fellowship at-- %$* 13
fifteen-- %$* 105
i lied about my age, but it was 15. %$* 105
at age 22.macarthur fellowship at 22, hoover national fellow at 25.at 28, you founded the global risk consultancy called the eurasia group. %$* 13
so, in ian bremmer years, it’s like the rest of us are dead and buried. %$* 13
so, with all the work and all the thinking you do, where do you rank china among the things that you think about? %$* 13
oh, you know, over the last couple of years, we’ve been spending our time thinking about the united states in terms of the financial crisis, the european crisis, and now everyone wants to know about iran. %$* 105
and of course, the fact is-- %$* 105
and this is one thing that all four of us i think will agree on-- %$* 105
the most important question that we need to answer is ultimately the disposition of china over the next five, 10 years. %$* 105
we’ve taken our eye off that ball. %$* 105
it’s going to get back. %$* 105
and your partner also saying that china does not do capitalism better than america, minxin pei. %$* 13
minxin, you are a professor at claremont mckenna. %$* 13
you were born in china, but you’ve been here 27 years and counting. %$* 13
you’re a dual citizen. %$* 13
you also have another duality. %$* 13
you’re a political scientist with a harvard ph.d., but you also have a master’s in creative writing. %$* 13
so, what does that tell us? %$* 13
what’s the aspiration? %$* 13
first of all, i want to correct, i only have u.s.citizenship. %$* 623
the chinese government will not allow me to have dual citizenship. %$* 623
well, having two terminal degrees gives me enormous advantage because most political scientists cannot write clearly-- %$* 623
because i have this creative writing degree, i can write more clearly than many of my colleagues. %$* 623
all right. %$* 13
thank you, minxin. %$* 13
and let’s let this debate begin. %$* 13
we have explained that we want to have you vote two times tonight. %$* 13
you are our judges are-- %$* 13
you, our live audience, serve as our judges. %$* 13
we have you vote now your conviction on this motion. %$* 13
we have you vote again at the end of the debate to tell us which side you think has actually presented the better argument. %$* 13
so, if you go to the keypads at your seat, our motion is "china does capitalism better than america.” if you agree with the motion, if you’re with this side at this point, you press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with this side, you push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, you push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys and also if you press the wrong key just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and so we're going to hold onto that result and we're going to present both results at the very end of the debate in the moment that we decide-- %$* 13
that you decide who the victor is. %$* 13
okay, on to round one. %$* 13
round one is opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
these statements are uninterrupted. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
and to speak first for the motion, peter schiff, ceo for euro pacific capital. %$* 13
you can-- %$* 13
no, we-- %$* 13
i just explained, we save them to the end. %$* 13
they both come at the end, and-- %$* 13
yeah, but the suspense will kill you throughout the evening. %$* 13
i'll need a timer. %$* 622
all right, it's-- %$* 622
i'm going to say some nice things about you for a moment. %$* 13
oh, okay. %$* 622
go right ahead. %$* 622
very briefly. %$* 13
peter schiff is ceo for euro pacific capital. %$* 13
he writes books, he has a radio show, the radio show is named after you, so there's no burden of false modesty or reticence here-- %$* 13
luckily for us. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
well, i'm the only one on the show. %$* 622
ladies and gentlemen, peter schiff. %$* 13
that's all you can come up with? %$* 622
as was stated, china is a communist nation in name only. %$* 622
it's not communist in the way the soviet union was communist. %$* 622
and unfortunately china kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad name. %$* 622
and i thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not, you know, "does china do capitalism better? %$* 622
" but it might-- %$* 622
but might be, "does america do capitalism worse than china? %$* 622
" because neither modern america or china does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century. %$* 622
but the problem is china is closer to what america used to be than america is today. %$* 622
and if you think about america at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, the government in this country spent 3 percent of the gdp on all levels, 3 percent. %$* 622
today the american government spends better than 40 percent of our gdp.if you look at china, it's about half as much of the gdp spent. %$* 622
if you look at taxes, which is a real measure of freedom, back in america in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had no corporate income tax, no state income taxes, americans were truly free in the sense that they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor. %$* 622
if you look at modern america and modern china, taxes are very high. %$* 622
they're just a lot higher here than they are in china. %$* 622
individual income taxes, the typical american pays a much higher share of his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll taxes and the employer portion that's passed on, paying much higher income taxes on a personal level than the typical chinese worker does. %$* 622
if you look at corporations, our corporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, china's 25, we tax dividends at 15 percent, they're at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money that the individuals are allowed to keep. %$* 622
you know, the american government is taking a much larger share of what people earn, and that's what's freedom, it's keeping the fruits of your labor. %$* 622
also, if you look at the regulatory environment in both china and the united states, i would argue that a young entrepreneur in america today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles in his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in china. %$* 622
the costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in america exceeds the costs in china, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is a byproduct of those rules and regulations. %$* 622
a lot of the things that the government does, if employers don't do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits, not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don't face that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in china. %$* 622
so if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point of view of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation. %$* 622
i mean, china is not as capitalistic as hong kong, which is a part of china but is more capitalistic than the mainland. %$* 622
but if you're going to compare it to the united states, the level of taxation, the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, i mean, america has-- %$* 622
our government has an enormous debt. %$* 622
our debt is now 100 percent of our gdp, and that is if you just count the funded portion of our debt. %$* 622
if you look at the off budget items, the unfunded portion of our debt, it's enormous. %$* 622
the chinese government doesn't have anywhere near that kind of liability. %$* 622
in fact, if you look at china and the united states and just compare the results of their economy. %$* 622
china is today, the world’s largest creditor nation. %$* 622
america is the world’s biggest debtor nation. %$* 622
china has large trade surpluses. %$* 622
america has enormous trade deficits. %$* 622
so if you thought about it as a nation, china has got-- %$* 622
i mean if you thought about the nation as a country, or as a corporation rather, china has a lot of assets on its balance sheet and lots of income, lots of profits. %$* 622
america is loaded up with liabilities and we’re hemorrhaging red ink. %$* 622
we have huge losses. %$* 622
so if you think that america is more capitalist than china or china is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is a better economic system because after all, the chinese are more successful if you want to measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade. %$* 622
so, and i don’t think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the soviet union, which was a communist country, the soviet union didn’t make anything, they didn’t produce anything. %$* 622
we constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves. %$* 622
pretty much everything is being made in china today and the united states; they have this enormous trade surplus. %$* 622
and more importantly, they’re accumulating massive savings. %$* 622
if you look at china, they have a savings rate of close to 50 percent. %$* 622
we have a savings rate, basically negative. %$* 622
in fact we rely in america on a ponzi scheme called social security. %$* 622
they don’t have social security in china. %$* 622
they don’t have a lot of these big government programs that we have in the united states. %$* 622
look at our monetary system. %$* 622
we have the federal reserve, price fixing, interest rates at practically zero. %$* 622
in all the macroeconomics and balances that we create, we micromanage our economy through our tax code. %$* 622
we’ve got the u.s.government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in the united states, so it’s not up to the free market. %$* 622
credit isn’t being allocated by the market; it’s being allocated by government. %$* 622
government is deciding who should get money and who shouldn’t get money and who it should subsidize and who it should penalize. %$* 622
it does all of this through the tax code and through the federal reserve. %$* 622
yes, you’ve got something similar going on in china, only in china i think it’s more above board. %$* 622
yes, there is government and you know that government’s involved and maybe you have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the united states. %$* 622
we’re just not as above board with it. %$* 622
and if you think about the partnership that government has with business in the united states, most of the laws and regulations, and i work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this is the same with industries all over the united states. %$* 622
you have all these regulatory bodies that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them. %$* 622
and that is a function of government, and it’s a combination of big business working with big government to stifle innovation and to stifle capitalism. %$* 622
and when you have the u.s. government taking such an enormous share of our gdp and taking such an enormous share of our output in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from washington d.c., we’re not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the united states. %$* 622
the unfortunate thing is that china is closer. %$* 622
but what’s more important is the direction in which the pendulum is swinging. %$* 622
in china, it’s swinging towards capitalism. %$* 622
unfortunately in america, it’s swinging away. %$* 622
thank you peter schiff. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america" and our next debater is going to speak against the motion. %$* 13
ian bremmer, who’s company eurasia group, makes its money by helping companies figure out when investing overseas is risky or not and so being right about china is practically his business model. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ian bremmer. %$* 13
first of all, orville said that china is a fickle mistress. %$* 105
and so getting china right is hard. %$* 105
and one thing we do all need to admit is that the level of volatility in outcomes in china over the next 10 to 20 years is vastly greater than the level of volatility in the united states or in europe or japan. %$* 105
can china make it? %$* 105
can they fundamentally transform their economic and political system? %$* 105
a country of 1.3 billion people. %$* 105
we know they need to it. %$* 105
the world bank just made it very clear. %$* 105
the chinese government admitted it themselves. %$* 105
doesn’t mean they can do it, it’s never been done before. %$* 105
it’s a bet. %$* 105
i’d bet against. %$* 105
but it’s a bet. %$* 105
if you have to make a bet, you bet on the united states. %$* 105
lots of people do, that’s why the u.s.still has the world’s reserve currency. %$* 105
i don’t know even where to start on this frankly, having just heard that china needs to bribe the right bureaucrats-- %$* 105
but same in the united states, we’re not as above board about that. %$* 105
that’s on its face ludicrous, right? %$* 105
china is a system where if you want to do well, the highest levels, 52 percent of the gdp-- %$* 105
62 percent of the gdp is state-owned enterprises, absolutely there is no rule of law. %$* 105
there’s no transparency. %$* 105
you don’t have as many regulations in china as the u.s.that is true. %$* 105
does that mean china does capitalism better? %$* 105
no. %$* 105
it means that if you’re china and you want to move a village and build a road, you can. %$* 105
it is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective or even most rapacious form. %$* 105
that’s the state doing what it wants to do for the state. %$* 105
that’s the problem. %$* 105
you want to talk about state intervention? %$* 105
we’ve got it. %$* 105
we’ve got it in china. %$* 105
look, it’s unfortunate to me we’re even debating this. %$* 105
five years ago, we wouldn’t. %$* 105
it shames me. %$* 105
it shames me as an american because there are people out there that believe that the united states can’t do capitalism as well as china. %$* 105
there are countries now that are doing capitalism better than the united states. %$* 105
if we were having this debate about canada, we wouldn’t have as much of a problem. %$* 105
we wouldn’t, right. %$* 105
on a lot of fronts-- %$* 105
i’m willing-- %$* 105
i’m not saying the united states is worse on everything. %$* 105
i’m saying that life increasingly, if you look at issues like the deficit for the u.s., if you look at financial regulations-- %$* 105
i’m not going to stand behind all that. %$* 105
but i am going to go after china, because ultimately we have a problem. %$* 105
look, the chinese system is not just capitalist; it’s state capitalist. %$* 105
state capitalism is a system where the state is the principal actor in the economy. %$* 105
and it uses markets ultimately for their own political gain. %$* 105
if it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain, they’ll go for it. %$* 105
if it turns out it isn’t, they’ll go against it. %$* 105
and that’s true whether we’re talking about chinese firms or whether we’re talking about western firms. %$* 105
i mean, facebook’s doing a pretty good ipo, but they’re not in china. %$* 105
why? %$* 105
china doesn’t want facebook in china. %$* 105
it’d make a lot of money. %$* 105
it’d make a lot of money for china. %$* 105
that’s not the point, right. %$* 105
that’s not capitalism. %$* 105
that’s a problem. %$* 105
ultimately, when we’ve seen state capitalism work globally, it works until it fails. %$* 105
and it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and i suspect peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, but it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff. %$* 105
argentina was state capitalist, looked as good as the united states in the western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran out of cheap land. %$* 105
and then they started defaulting. %$* 105
venezuela looked great on cheap oil. %$* 105
not so much anymore, right. %$* 105
china’s looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheap labor. %$* 105
china will ultimately run out of cheap labor. %$* 105
so, what we have in china is this extraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road. %$* 105
and that road has been straight for 34 years, but coming up there’s a big turn in the road %$* 105
.and we’ve never seen steering. %$* 105
maybe-- %$* 105
thank you, mom-- %$* 105
maybe-- %$* 105
maybe they have steering, but we don’t know. %$* 105
and the fact is that if you are china, there’s one thing you’re going to have a very hard time doing. %$* 105
there are no more zhu rongjis and deng xiaopings in china. %$* 105
you don’t have strong individual leadership. %$* 105
you have leadership by consensus, individuals that are moving together very incrementally. %$* 105
they’re very cautious. %$* 105
they understand the importance of the stakes they are playing for. %$* 105
the one thing that you will not do well is go after your own intrinsic interests. %$* 105
the state-owned enterprises that are providing you money-- %$* 105
that’s where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets more expensive. %$* 105
that’s where the inefficiency will be when the united states and other western multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off. %$* 105
another problem with chinese state capitalism is it creates enemies, you know. %$* 105
there are a lot of folks around asia. %$* 105
they see the chinese economic miracle, but they’re begging the united states to maintain a presence. %$* 105
why? %$* 105
because china does capitalism better than the united states? %$* 105
i don’t think so. %$* 105
we got to watch what people do, not what people say, what they do. %$* 105
did you see that piece in the wall street journal, talked about the disposition of chinese millionaires, how over 50 percent of chinese millionaires say they prefer to live in the united states than china? %$* 105
and yeah, it’s about quality of life. %$* 105
yeah, it’s about the environment. %$* 105
yeah, it’s about opportunities for their kids. %$* 105
it’s also about no rule of law in china and worrying about corruption and the sanctity of their assets over the long term. %$* 105
your assets are okay tomorrow. %$* 105
the united states, we’re over-litigious. %$* 105
china doesn’t have that problem. %$* 105
you don’t have to worry about lawyers in china. %$* 105
you have to worry about someone ripping off your stuff or being forced out of the country or not being heard from again. %$* 105
now, maybe peter believes that those 50-plus percent of chinese millionaires are stupid. %$* 105
because ultimately, the united states is in decline, and so they shouldn’t be coming here, in which case, fine, but then china’s millionaires aren’t that bright. %$* 105
and those are the entrepreneurs, so we shouldn’t bet on them either way. %$* 105
you’re in a catch-22, sir. %$* 105
know, i’m interested in what the chinese do with their money. %$* 105
i understand that the chinese are saying that they don’t like the u.s. dollar as a reserve currency, but where are they putting their cash? %$* 105
in the u.s.now, ron paul and peter say they shouldn’t do that, and then we’re in big trouble. %$* 105
okay, well, when are they going to stop? %$* 105
because i don’t believe the chinese are stupid. %$* 105
for me, that’s not an interesting analytical model. %$* 105
for me, what’s interesting is presuming the chinese understand their interests and they’re putting all that money into treasuries because they believe that’s safe over the long term. %$* 105
we are entering an environment of fear. %$* 105
we’re entering an environment of volatility. %$* 105
when things get more volatile, we don’t just bet on go-go- growth any more. %$* 105
we put our money under the mattresses. %$* 105
central banks do that too. %$* 105
and in that environment, the world’s largest economy, also ultimately the most resilient, the united states of america. %$* 105
thank you very much. %$* 105
thank you, ian bremmer. %$* 13
here’s our motion: "china does capitalism better than america.” we have heard the first two speakers, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i’ve lost a page here. %$* 13
orville schell, i’m just going to vamp. %$* 13
orville schell is head of the center for u.s.- china relations at the asian society. %$* 13
you have also written something like nine books that have the word china in the title and some that don’t have china in the title. %$* 13
you know what you’re talking about. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, orville schell. %$* 13
well, i find myself in the awkward position, being an american, deeply believing in this country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers, to defend a marxist-leninist economy. %$* 621
and i beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my argument and please convince me i am wrong by voting against me at the end of this debate. %$* 621
i would say that the comparison between capitalism in the united states and china is as much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise. %$* 621
and there, in a very counterintuitive way, one we hardly have expected, the chinese communist party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which i think all of us would agree, over the past three decades, has been quite extraordinary-- %$* 621
something none of us who were standing in the middle of tiananmen square of 1989 when there were a million people demonstrating there, thought could ever possibly happen. %$* 621
so, i think if we look at america, we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological self-doubt at this particular moment. %$* 621
we find a country that has had much of its government, many of its leaders besieged by irrationality, religiosity, they don’t believe in evolution, they don’t believe in climate change, we cannot pass a simple measure in congress to extend the national debt, which is not going to not happen. %$* 621
how can a government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason, how can it be the custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside over? %$* 621
this is not to say that we don’t venerate entrepreneurs, we don’t venerate innovation, and we don’t believe in a free economy. %$* 621
but let me read you just simply what adam smith had to say, the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism. %$* 621
he said that when the security of the whole society is at stake, natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments, the most free as well as the most despotical. %$* 621
and i think it is precisely here that we have failed. %$* 621
and by doing so, we have lent a greater credence to this curious, cryptic, hybrid version of leninist capital, which china has employed, to quite a bit of success, i would have to say. %$* 621
so let's quickly just look at what we see in china. %$* 621
i spoke of the psychological dimension of the problem in this country, and i think everybody in this room feels it. %$* 621
there is a sense of i think lassitude. %$* 621
at the same time, greed is quite a force lost in the land. %$* 621
there's a great deal of self deception at work. %$* 621
if you look at china, who's running the government in china now? %$* 621
they're all engineers. %$* 621
in many ways, the very things that we used to impute to china as a great weakness, namely, a over reliance on ideology, are now the very things that are hampering our own country, while china, governed by engineers and technocrats, tends to look at reason. %$* 621
there are no climate deniers in china. %$* 621
i have never spoken to a chinese who doubted evolution. %$* 621
and yet the ranks of the american political houses of congress are replete with these people, and they're making decisions which govern how we live and govern the american economy. %$* 621
china also has managed in a way that i think it deserves our esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done. %$* 621
when a stimulus program needs to be enacted, they look at the facts and they enact it. %$* 621
do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to some retrograde period of stalinist economics? %$* 621
well, i think the united states could do with a good five-year plan. %$* 621
we can't plan for three months ahead. %$* 621
we have no ability even to execute policy, much less long range policy. %$* 621
if you go to washington, you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy documents. %$* 621
why? %$* 621
because nobody can do anything with them. %$* 621
i think this ability of china to martial facts rationally, to martial its resources and make policy and allocate capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own country could learn from. %$* 621
i want to read a quick quote from henny sender from the financial times. %$* 621
"the combination of chinese soes and debt from state owned banks is a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of china as well as within it." i think that's an interesting statement from a paper that's basically a laissez faire capitalist paper. %$* 621
so finally i would say that we would do well not to assume that china has nothing to teach the united states. %$* 621
it may be that this system will not endure in the future. %$* 621
it has many structural weaknesses. %$* 621
but to date i would say it has been ascending while our own form of capitalism, replete with the weaknesses that you all well know, has been in a state of decline. %$* 621
and whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come. %$* 621
thank you, orville schell. %$* 13
our motion is, "china does capitalism better than america." and our final debater speaking against the motion, speaks the chinese language better than anyone on this stage, he has the advantage of having been born there, but he has been living here for decades, a professor of government at claremont mckenna, the titles of his books and articles on china's future use phrases like, "china's trapped transition,” “looming stagnation," so we don't need to ask what he really thinks. %$* 13
but here's more of what he does think. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, minxin pei. %$* 13
i'm not going to speak in chinese. %$* 623
i think that the impression that china is doing capitalism better than the u.s.is understandable. %$* 623
that's because it's a very superficial impression. %$* 623
one reason why that impression is widespread is that china has been growing fast. %$* 623
but there's a reason china is growing fast. %$* 623
low income countries tend to grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential. %$* 623
just think of two things. %$* 623
consumption of energy. %$* 623
chinese consumption of energy is about one-fourth of the u.s. consumption. %$* 623
so the chinese, if they consume more energy, they will grow a lot faster. %$* 623
the same with steel production. %$* 623
china consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average american consumes. %$* 623
so if they want to reach american consumption, they need to build a lot of steel plants, and that makes economic growth. %$* 623
so first of all, do not judge whether a country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers. %$* 623
second is that when you compare the two countries, the u.s.and china, you have to look at facts. %$* 623
this presentation is nothing but man the facts. %$* 623
so what are the facts? %$* 623
if you look at corporate profits, u.s.companies are far more profitable than chinese companies. %$* 623
and that is to think that we can trust chinese accounting. %$* 623
and then you look at tax collection. %$* 623
i have to disagree with peter. %$* 623
he says the chinese, they collect less taxes than u.s.the opposite is true. %$* 623
the u.s.government takes about federal/state, about 30 percent of gdp.the chinese government collects 35 percent. %$* 623
but that’s not the end of the story. %$* 623
because in the u.s., you actually get something back from the government in the form of social security, health care, medicare, medicaid. %$* 623
in china, you get very little back because the bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption, administration. %$* 623
if you go to china and get treated to a 20-course meal, you think great, that’s chinese hospitality. %$* 623
but don’t forget, it’s being paid for by chinese taxpayers. %$* 623
not in the usa. you do not get that kind of treatment when you go to washington, d.c. and then you look at whether china’s growth is using less natural resources. %$* 623
and here the u.s.is three times more efficient as china. %$* 623
because for every dollar of gdp produced in china, china has to consume three times more in terms of its natural resources, water, clean air, land. %$* 623
the u.s.in other words, is a lot more efficient. %$* 623
then you look at international comparisons, and here we’re using third-party numbers. %$* 623
and here, china does not look nearly as good as the u.s.corruption. %$* 623
there’s a ngo based in berlin called transparency international. %$* 623
it publishes every year, a global index called corruption perception index. %$* 623
this index, the u.s.is ranked 24th in terms of, as the least corrupt country in the world. %$* 623
china is ranked 75.so if you think our average politician in washington is corrupt, wait until you meet a chinese politician. %$* 623
you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its efficiency and competitiveness. %$* 623
here, the u.s.is ranked not number one, number five. %$* 623
what about china? %$* 623
china is number 26.so way, way behind the u.s.then you look at something like innovation ranking. %$* 623
the u.s.is number seven; china is 29.you look at ease of doing business. %$* 623
this is by the world bank. %$* 623
because, a real capitalist country should be one in which it is very easy to do business. %$* 623
overall ranking for the u.s.is number four in the world. %$* 623
china is number 91. then starting a business, u.s. is number 13; china is number 151. getting credit, the u.s. is number four; china is number 67. the list goes on and on and i don’t want to bore you. %$* 623
finally, i want to imagine, what will the politburo members think about this debate? %$* 623
if for some reason, they’ve learned that in new york city, they’re debating whether china does capitalism better than the u.s.i think their first reaction is not to laugh. %$* 623
you build the world’s largest high-speed rail at enormous cost. %$* 623
they think the u.s.is falling behind. %$* 623
then you lend the americans $2 trillion. %$* 623
they think, china is definitely number one. %$* 623
so, the third thought that would come to their mind is that the americans have very short memories, because when sputnik was launched, everybody thought the soviet union was to dominate the world. %$* 623
and then in the late 1980s, i think in this city, people should have good memories about who was buying the rockefeller center, right. %$* 623
japan was dominating the headlines. %$* 623
everybody thought japan was doing capitalism better than the u.s.now, look at where japan is after 20 years. %$* 623
so, i think what we’re seeing here is not that china does capitalism better than the u.s.; we are experiencing a period of self-doubt. %$* 623
i’m sure the real issue is not about china. %$* 623
the real issue is about the u.s.the u.s.can do capitalism much better than it does, but china, at least for the moment and for the foreseeable future, will not be doing capitalism anywhere better, anywhere close to the u.s.in terms of competition, efficiency, even social justice. %$* 623
thank you. %$* 623
thank you, minxin pei. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
when we return, the debaters go head-to-head in round two. %$* 13
we’ll be right back. %$* 13
and now we are right back. %$* 13
we’re just going to have these lecterns removed, and then i’m going to raise my hand for a round of applause. %$* 13
and imagine commercials are playing somewhere. %$* 13
okay, let’s start again. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
now, on to round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
this is where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have here two teams of two who are arguing out this motion: "china does capitalism better than america.” we’ve heard the team arguing in support of the motion, peter schiff and orville schell, basically saying that china does capitalism better because there’s actually more freedom to do things that involved capitalism, that there are fewer regulations, that there are lower taxes. %$* 13
it is not pure capitalism and they’re not arguing that, but they’re saying that it’s more pure than the u.s.has had in the last 100 years. %$* 13
china’s amazing growth rate really seals the argument for them, but they also make the point that possibly an economy operating under the apparatus of what we call a democracy in this country has its downside. %$* 13
and they suggest that maybe a little planning is not such a bad thing. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, ian bremmer and minxin pei. %$* 13
they’re making the argument that what china’s doing, even if it could be called capitalism, is something that’s probably cruising for a crash, that when the government is the biggest player in the market, as they argue that it is, point out that it is, this tends to lead to corruption and to cronyism and ultimately to exposure of the lack of real innovation. %$* 13
they basically are also making something of a hare and hedgehog argument and pointing out that china is the hare and it’s in a good dash right now, but that the u.s.is the hedgehog, plodding along steadily and more reliably. %$* 13
so, i want to take a question from this side’s argument to that side, and that’s that argument that what we’re seeing from china, this enormous growth rate, your opponents have pointed out, number one, is the result of china coming off a much lower baseline. %$* 13
and when things get really volatile, things can really fall apart there. %$* 13
and they’re essentially saying that what’s happening in china over the long haul is a blip. %$* 13
is it a blip? %$* 13
peter schiff. %$* 13
well, first of all, there are a lot of countries that are starting on low baselines that are not having any kind of economic growth at all. %$* 622
so, the difference is you do have more capitalism now in china, and it’s that freedom, it’s that-- %$* 622
those market forces that are responsible for the growth, not that because they’re poor, because there were plenty of people that were poor and that didn’t grow at all. %$* 622
as far as whether the trajectory is sustainable, i think not only is it just sustainable, but i think it’s going to get better because the real country that’s headed for a crisis is america. %$* 622
and i think what’s dragging the chinese down is their currency peg. %$* 622
they’re loaning america all this money, so american can keep buying the products that americans really can’t afford. %$* 622
and so, as a result, the chinese are debasing their currency and they’re creating a lot of inflation, which is destabilizing their economy and, i think, undermining the standard of living of their own citizens, which would be rising even faster if the chinese government simply let the rmb rise in value, let the dollar tank. %$* 622
if the chinese government didn’t take so much of the chinese production and just loan it to america so that it could be squandered on big government and consumption, but i think eventually-- %$* 622
so, if that is so unwise by the chinese government, is this a blip period for them then? %$* 13
well, i think they’re going to figure this out, and they’re not going to play this game anymore. %$* 622
and the real crash is coming here, because then interest rates skyrocket, the dollar tanks, consumer prices go through the roof, and we have our greek moment, only there’s no europe to bail us out. %$* 622
ian bremmer, do you want to respond? %$* 13
well, yeah. %$* 105
we’re not heading for a greek moment. %$* 105
i mean, comparing us with greece is almost as ludicrous as comparing us to china. %$* 105
yeah, it’s not fair to the greeks. %$* 622
i don’t think you even believe that. %$* 105
but leave it aside. %$* 105
look, i mean-- %$* 105
you’ve got to read my book. %$* 622
no, i’ll get there. %$* 105
i’ll get there. %$* 105
look, the united states has so many strong intrinsic advantages in terms of not just the matter of where the dollar sits but also, i mean, 30 percent of the world’s calories comes from the united states. %$* 105
people are increasingly fighting over food. %$* 105
that’s a real problem for china. %$* 105
the environment in china is absolutely falling apart. %$* 105
if you look at environment-adjusted gdp, it’s so much worse than the growth you see presently. %$* 105
we already heard from minxin about just how much more profitable american multinationals are than chinese soes, and yet that china is moving more in the direction towards soes, not towards private sectors, especially since 2008. %$* 105
all of these things are problematic, and the ability of the chinese to suddenly make a decision to go away from the dollar, you have to go into something. %$* 105
what exactly are you going into? %$* 105
you’re going into the euro in an enormous way. %$* 105
i don’t see that in terms of massive growth opportunities. %$* 105
you’re going into japan? %$* 105
we already said we had two lost decades there. %$* 105
you’re going to go into gold or hard commodities? %$* 105
you can do some of that. %$* 105
you can only do so much. %$* 105
and as you go away from the dollar, you of course ruin the position that you have in the rest of those dollars. %$* 105
so china’s not going to do that. %$* 105

richard fisher. %$* 13
losing our audience by talking about the bank of england-- %$* 253
and the vickers commission. %$* 253
i do want-- %$* 253
it's amazing, the vickers commission, i mean-- %$* 13
yeah, that's right. %$* 253
cough drops banking. %$* 18
no, no, but-- %$* 253
well, we'll try to-- %$* 253
can i just say one thing, if i may? %$* 253
yeah. %$* 13
i mean, paul, you know i love you. %$* 253
you're a good man. %$* 253
uh-oh, here it comes. %$* 256
but, to make the claim, and i quote, "the big banks were stabilizing influences during a crisis." they were the spreaders of the crisis. %$* 253
they were not a stabilizing influence-- %$* 253
richard, i'd have to disagree. %$* 18
and i know because they came to us to ask for protection. %$* 253
goldman sachs-- %$* 253
there were many banks-- %$* 256
bank holding company. %$* 253
as you well know, richard, there were many banks-- %$* 256
paul saltzman. %$* 13
that did not need funds. %$* 256
there were many banks that acquired failing institutions-- %$* 256
yes. %$* 253
at the request of the government to stabilize the market. %$* 256
and frankly no good deed goes unpunished, if you read the newspaper these days, you know. %$* 256
and if we can get back to the point earlier, are you suggesting that we now have only domestic banks-- %$* 256
of course not. %$* 253
and that not only do we have small banks but we have only domestic banks because of cross border resolution issues? %$* 256
is that your position, simon? %$* 256
paul, on the crisis that happened, one word-- %$* 254
one word for paul, one word for you, citigroup, okay? %$* 254
citigroup was at the center of the financial crisis. %$* 254
but why are we spending so much time, john, talking about the last crisis? %$* 254
we should be talking about the future. %$* 254
we should talk about the next crisis. %$* 254
“too big to fail” became a salient problem in the fall of 2008 because the banks said-- %$* 254
they argued, with some justification, "we've become so big, you cannot let us fail."that's when “too big to fail” really became the problem that we're now trying to confront. %$* 254
so what happened in the last crisis is interesting, no doubt, we can argue about it for a long time, but it's what happens going forward, and how do we deal with the “too big to fail” institutions-- %$* 254
well, let me put the question back to you that i put to the other side which is that if jpmorgan went down would it bring the whole economy down with it? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 254
it would jeopardize our-- %$* 253
richard fisher. %$* 13
security and financial security as well as our economy. %$* 253
and let me just explain how it works. %$* 253
i mentioned the so-called sifis, systemically important financial institutions. %$* 253
there's a declaration of who is a sifi and who is not. %$* 253
that is made by a body chaired by the secretary of the treasury. %$* 253
as you pointed out in your cogent argument, that body is inherently political. %$* 253
it is chaired by the secretary of the treasury. %$* 253
republican or democrat, they report to the president of the united states. %$* 253
if a bank that has $4 trillion in assets-- %$* 253
and, by the way, a derivatives book of a nominal value or a notional value of 80 trillion, which is jpmorgan, 8-0 trillion in derivatives-- %$* 253
if that bank were to be on the verge of some type of failure, do you actually think the secretary of the treasury and the body that he chairs, which includes the federal reserve chairman, would let that bank go under, that any president would allow that to happen in-- %$* 253
okay, you've stated a great question, and i want to let this side-- %$* 13
enormous-- %$* 253
answer that question specifically, do you think that the fed would let the bank go down? %$* 13
can i come back to a-- %$* 255
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
no. %$* 255
i will let you come back to it. %$* 13
it's a great question and i need to hear an answer. %$* 13
and then i will give you the floor. %$* 13
okay, thank you. %$* 255
i will. %$* 13
doug, question, doug, did you want to-- %$* 13
yes or no? %$* 253
we are a couple years away from having the things in place. %$* 255
i'm willing to wait the couple of years while we get it done, but yes after dodd-frank is implemented in that manner, yes, i do believe it will have become possible. %$* 255
why wait a couple of years? %$* 254
okay, wait, but then i had a-- %$* 13
you had a follow-up point there? %$* 13
i promised. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 255
what is it? %$* 13
i don't actually know what simon's proposal is, and i'm not crystal clear on what richard's proposal is. %$* 255
do you want to break up the banks based on size characteristics? %$* 255
or do you want to go back to a kind of glass-steagall, or do you insist on both? %$* 255
what is it you're actually-- %$* 255
in other words, do you just want to shrink all of these bank's balance sheets or do you want to cut up their functions and separate the different kinds of things they do in the different institutions? %$* 13
what i have proposed, which what simon and i are suggesting, is that your exposure as taxpayers should be limited and all government guarantees purely limited to the commercial banking operation of a complex bank-holding company. %$* 253
i have to go to this question. %$* 13
richard, i have to go to their question. %$* 13
how does that represent breaking up the big banks? %$* 13
hold on. %$* 253
and that all other aspects of that business are subject to the same risk of anybody that conducts that kind of business, whatever that business may be. %$* 253
there are no guarantees and, you know, it doesn't take a meat axe, which is the term you used, the markets will downsize and restructure and reward those who are efficient rather than their having been protected by government guarantees. %$* 253
with all due respect, i think i've heard a concession. %$* 256
again, i'll go back to-- %$* 256
it's not a concession. %$* 253
you think in other words you agree with me? %$* 253
do you or do you not want the government to break up the big banks? %$* 256
that's what we're here debating, richard. %$* 256
listen-- %$* 253
answer the question. %$* 256
answer the question. %$* 256
yeah, i want the government to set the rules and i want the market to enforce the breakup. %$* 253
and i agree with that. %$* 256
yes. %$* 256
okay? %$* 256
we won the debate. %$* 18
thank you very much, ladies and gentleman. %$* 18
the debate's over. %$* 256
let's vote on whether or not i have a brooklyn accent. %$* 256
simon johnson. %$* 13
simon johnson, you have the floor. %$* 13
paul, what we want here is an end to the subsidies. %$* 254
the government subsides that are keeping this financial structure in-- %$* 254
yeah, but that's not the language of the motion, i have to say. %$* 256
so the subsidies and-- %$* 254
it wasn't pull the subsidies, it was break up the big banks. %$* 256
we want to-- %$* 254
we won the motion, so let's go to the next question. %$* 256
strip out the subsidies of the banks and you are going to break up the banks. %$* 254
it is breaking up the banks. %$* 254
i want to go back to something doug-- %$* 254
in other words, you're saying the process of stripping out the subsidies would ultimately result in the shrinking and the diversification of the banks? %$* 256
why-- %$* 254
is that what you're saying? %$* 256
why do you have to-- %$* 254
is that what you're saying? %$* 256
i just want clarity. %$* 256
please answer. %$* 256
please say your question again. %$* 254
you're asking about pulling these guarantees-- %$* 256
that the process of pulling these guarantees would through market forces cause the banks to get smaller and perhaps to diversify, rather than the meat axe. %$* 256
is that what you're saying? %$* 256
they would certainly make them get smaller. %$* 254
people-- %$* 254
big banks-- %$* 254
i'm trying to help you guys connect your arguments in breaking up the big banks. %$* 256
not because i want you to win or not, but i just want you to get on topic. %$* 256
i want to go back to a very important-- %$* 254
yeah, simon johnson. %$* 13
which is we're a couple of years away from something magical happening. %$* 254
why are we a couple of years away? %$* 254
well, dodd-frank passed in 2010. three years later, how much of it has been implemented? %$* 254
relatively little. %$* 254
why? %$* 254
because there's been a huge pushback from the industry. %$* 254
now, paul and his colleagues are completely within their constitutional rights. %$* 254
i'm not complaining about it. %$* 254
i'm merely pointing out that there is an enormously powerful lobby, particularly around these very large banks that has resisted dodd-frank. %$* 254
it's resisted the living wills that paul mentioned. %$* 254
it's resisted implementing a lot of other measures that would curtail the range of activities and the power of these very large banks. %$* 254
that's why we haven't made progress and we’re not a couple of years away-- %$* 254
we're decades away-- %$* 254
just one second, paul. %$* 13
i need to take note of the fact that you guys have had a very long run at the microphone. %$* 13
so, this time-- %$* 13
side is going to get a little bit extra time before being interrupted unless you yield. %$* 13
simon, now it's my turn. %$* 255
i love you, okay? %$* 255
it was richard who loves you paul, not me. %$* 254
i love you both. %$* 253
okay, simon. %$* 253
it’s unrequited. %$* 18
but why do you insist on continuing to mischaracterize the industry position? %$* 256
i represent the clearing house. %$* 256
we have been nothing but constructive in the dodd-frank debate. %$* 256
we have supported living wills. %$* 256
we have supported higher capital charges. %$* 256
we have supported prescriptive liquidity rules. %$* 256
we have supported the vast array of macro-prudential rules. %$* 256
we have spent millions of dollars through simulations and otherwise to try and create a framework in which “too big to fail” ends. %$* 256
we are in agreement. %$* 256
we don't want subsidies. %$* 256
we don't want moral hazard risk. %$* 256
the disagreement is the proposition on the table is you guys are in favor of the proposition to break up the big banks. %$* 256
this is not about glass-steagall, and richard, your proposal is very reasonable and tomorrow if you want to have a debate about your proposal, let's do that. %$* 256
but that's not what's here tonight. %$* 256
what's here tonight is a proposal on the table for the government, the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to anything in washington. %$* 256
you want them to set arbitrary size limits and break up the big banks. %$* 256
i think that is preposterous. %$* 256
i want to let you respond, and then i want to move on, richard-- %$* 13
to richard fisher. %$* 13
well, the result is to break them up. %$* 253
the proposal that has been made achieves exactly that. %$* 253
so it does achieve the purpose of this debate. %$* 253
all these banks that you acknowledge are too big to fail, you believe that this massive legislation, over 13,000 pages of rules that have been promoted, some 24 plus million hours, for man and women hours, every year to try to discern, interpret and put in place solves the problem of too big to fail. %$* 253
i don't believe it does so. %$* 253
i think it enshrines too big to fail. %$* 253
and i believe, most importantly, it places the smaller banks, who wish to grow and wish to compete and provide services and have a fair chance to compete, on an un-level playing field. %$* 253
i think what we should all propose is that we go for any bank that is too big to fail, make it too small to save. %$* 253
exactly what the small banks-- %$* 253
you were saying that the small banks take the same kinds of risks. %$* 253
you're right. %$* 253
you know what happens if they fail? %$* 253
they're shut on a friday, and they re-open on monday with a new ownership, and the management is gone, fired, gotten rid of. %$* 253
i just want the same thing for the large banks. %$* 253
that's all i ask. %$* 253
doug elliot. %$* 13
and that would be the outcome of our proposal. %$* 253
doug elliot. %$* 13
just quickly, what you're describing is what's done with small banks when there's a few, when there's a lot of them like the savings and loan crisis, that isn't-- %$* 255
i lived through that crisis. %$* 253
the federal reserve bank of dallas played the key role in that crisis. %$* 253
and let me just tell you something, we-- %$* 253
we lost you midpoint, richard, and i will let you say something-- %$* 13
i just want to let you finish your point, and i will come back to you. %$* 13
you're a damn good interrupter. %$* 13
but i will come back to you. %$* 13
so am i. go ahead, doug. %$* 13
it's good to be president. %$* 255
go ahead, please. %$* 13
i really wasn't going to go much further than that, just-- %$* 255
great. %$* 13
no, no. %$* 255
i fight for your right-- %$* 13
john, john-- %$* 255
john, i didn't say much further. %$* 255
i didn't say i was stopping. %$* 255
okay. %$* 13
all i was going to say is there have been many instances here and elsewhere, where there's a systemic crisis of small banks and then we do end up having to rescue them. %$* 255
so just making all the big banks just small enough to meet your arbitrary criteria doesn't make the risk go away. %$* 255
richard fisher. %$* 13
my comment in the epicenter of exactly what you speak about, texas. %$* 253
we lost not only 600 plus small banks, but the sixth, seventh and eighth largest banks in america. %$* 253
they were closed quickly. %$* 253
they were shuttered. %$* 253
isn't it interesting-- %$* 253
no offense to new york-- %$* 253
that texas is now the most prosperous state in america? %$* 253
and we did it without too big to fail banks. %$* 253
and in fact, we closed the banks that then were considered too big to fail. %$* 253
and paul volcker was the master of that closure process. %$* 253
i want to move on to audience questions in a minute. %$* 13
i have one more topic that i want to bring to the debaters. %$* 13
but i just want to remind you that you'll raise your hand. %$* 13
folks, if you're upstairs, i can't see you, and there are no mics up there, so you'll have to come down and stand on the steps. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, a mic will come to you. %$* 13
i'll ask you to hold it about that distance from your mouth so that the radio broadcast can hear you clearly. %$* 13
we ask you to state your name. %$* 13
if you're with a news organization, we'd appreciate it if you would identify yourself as such. %$* 13
and as that's getting set up, i just want to take one more question to the side that's arguing for breaking up the big banks, an argument that your opponents made, that-- %$* 13
that global business demands global banks and that there are businesses that rely very much on the banks now that are massive in scope, that they serve a function, that they became big in part because of the needs of their clients. %$* 13
and i just want to ask simon johnson to take on that point, and then we'll hear a response from your opponents. %$* 13
well, i don't think anyone is proposing that you shrink all the banks down to some very tiny size. %$* 254
as i said, goldman sachs was a substantial international bank, one of the best international banks in the world in the mid-1990s. %$* 254
it was less than a quarter of the size that it became at the height of the financial crisis. %$* 254
so that's exactly what we mean when we say, take away the subsidies, break up the banks; the market will sort out the ones who should fail, the ones who should survive. %$* 254
without those subsidies, john, they will be substantially smaller, and they'll be more competitive globally. %$* 254
you really want big, mega-crazy banks like the europeans have? %$* 254
i don't think so. %$* 254
let's take it to the other side. %$* 13
paul saltzman. %$* 13
just-- %$* 256
i'd just like to read something from the dallas annual report to clarify the point about size: mega-banks, those banks with assets in excess of 250 billion, under your proposal, you'd break up u.s.bank, you'd break up capital one, you'd break up pnc.that's the problem with the proposal. %$* 256
no one has a monopoly on understanding what the right size is. %$* 256
banks are appropriately sized for the needs of their customers. %$* 256
fedex, amazon, apple, google. %$* 256
verizon just merged with vodaphone, $130 billion merger. %$* 256
we need these global banks to service the community that they operate in, which for better or for worse is global and interconnected. %$* 256
so i think, which is it? %$* 256
if it's 250 billion, is it 500 billion? %$* 256
is it 1 trillion? %$* 256
that's the problem. %$* 256
the size of these banks are determined by the marketplace. %$* 256
richard fisher. %$* 13
by the way, on the verizon transaction, as you know, that was financed by issuing stock. %$* 253
and a bridge loan with four banks pulling together $65 billion over a four-week period. %$* 255
yep. %$* 253
and if there hadn't been those four banks, you would have found other banks to do it. %$* 253
do you have an answer to the question of what’s the size-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 253
when we refer to mega-banks, we're just differentiating the size of the banks in the country. %$* 253
when we refer to breaking up the banks, we're talking about banks that are too big to fail. %$* 253
and we're talking about basically 11 banks that are presently covered by that status. %$* 253
systemically important financial institutions. %$* 253
some have a simpler book, some have a more complex book. %$* 253
but i think it's kind of an artificial argument. %$* 253
yes, determines a mega-bank, but it doesn't mean it may be too big to fail. %$* 253
the banks that are too big to fail, so complicated, so large, that even their own managers have trouble understanding the scale and scope of those operations. %$* 253
that's what we're addressing here this evening. %$* 253
let's go to some audience questions. %$* 13
sir, right down here, front. %$* 13
and a mic's coming down, and then if you could tell us who you are and be terse and perfect. %$* 13
mr. %$* 13
terse? %$* 13
scott shea. %$* 18
and a question for each side. %$* 18
for the opponents, you've mentioned the consolidation of the rest of american industry. %$* 18
and you said the banks are consolidating in the same way. %$* 18
couldn't it be the causation goes the other way, that the immense over-consolidation of the banking industry has caused the rest of the economy to follow in its wake and it's raised the brittleness of the u.s. economy, decreased job formation, made middle market lending harder to achieve and harder to get because the big banks are indeed so big. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
my question-- %$* 18
we have a one-question-per-person rule. %$* 13
you can tell a friend and-- %$* 13
it's a harder question. %$* 18
and-- %$* 13
i should have pointed that out, no two-part questions or-- %$* 13
let's let the side arguing against the motion to break up the banks answer that. %$* 13
if i could just start very briefly; paul may want to add something. %$* 255
look, there's-- %$* 255
as far as i know, there's no economic evidence for the theory you just put out there. %$* 255
it doesn't sound right to me, but i've also never seen anyone-- %$* 255
anyone make that case. %$* 255
paul saltzman. %$* 13
yeah, banks mirror society. %$* 256
societies don't mirror banks. %$* 256
banks serve customer needs. %$* 256
google is not large. %$* 256
ibm doesn't have businesses in 170 countries because jpmorgan exists. %$* 256
so i would say it's exactly the other way. %$* 256
businesses becoming global-- %$* 256
small businesses are becoming global, and banks service their needs. %$* 256
the other concept i'd like to get on the table is economies of size, scope and scale. %$* 256
if you pay a million dollars for a computer, and you have one customer, you have to charge that person a million dollars. %$* 256
if you have a million customers, you get to charge that person a dollar. %$* 256
it's pretty simple. %$* 256
over the past five years, you have enormous technology expenses that need to get spread out over a large customer base. %$* 256
that is in large part why banks are getting larger and larger, because of those global and technology needs. %$* 256
would this side like to respond? %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
simon johnson. %$* 13
when i talk to the cfos of large international corporations, the people who run the financial side of those businesses, nonfinancial corporations, i ask them, do you need-- %$* 254
do you want to have one big global bank handling all your financial operations everywhere in the world? %$* 254
it's a fair question. %$* 254
and they say, no, we don't. %$* 254
what we want is different providers in different places. %$* 254
the idea we would single-source all of our credit, all of our financial transactions, that's actually a bad idea. %$* 254
we want to have different people, and we want to be able to pick and choose depending on who has a good price-- %$* 254
who has better customer service in a particular market. %$* 254
so the idea that the big or international business somehow needs colossal at this scale international banks is a complete fallacy. %$* 254
douglas elliott, doug elliott. %$* 13
two quick things, one, you just made a straw mat argument. %$* 255
nobody that i know is making the argument that the big companies want to have one bank. %$* 255
i worked in the banks-- %$* 255
but paul just made that argument. %$* 254
no. %$* 255
the argument is that they want a small number of banks that they are close to and that each of those have to have the scale. %$* 255
they want some competition between-- %$* 255
so we want the world to be run by what? %$* 254
what's your number of banks, doug? %$* 254
four banks, five banks, what's your comfort spot here? %$* 254
he’ll answer that when you answer that when you answer what the number of-- %$* 13
size is. %$* 13
i would love to have that answer first. %$* 255
i will answer that question if you do first answer the other one. %$* 255
let's go to another question. %$* 13
wait, wait, wait. %$* 253
paul gave us an answer, by the way. %$* 253
his logic chain is if we had one bank that serviced 320 million customers, we'd be better off. %$* 253
that's the end of your logic chain-- %$* 253
no, that's not what i said. %$* 256
oh, come on. %$* 253
you were talking about economies of scale, economies-- %$* 253
size, scope, and scale. %$* 256
right. %$* 253
regulators from the federal reserve bank of philadelphia, regulators from the federal reserve bank of st. %$* 256
louis, your colleagues in the federal reserve system have indicated through empirical studies, not ephemeral conversations with cfos. %$* 256
i talk to cfos as well. %$* 256
look at the business roundtable report instead of some ephemeral conversation with-- %$* 256
business roundtable is dominated by large banks and large-- %$* 253
all right, i want to go to this question here. %$* 13
ma'am, do you mind-- %$* 13
because our-- %$* 13
of our camera placement, this is scary, but just go up three or four steps so that we can look-- %$* 13
see you? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
okay, that's great. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
my name's jessica bloomgarten and the question is for the against side. %$* 19
you guys have been very focused on making the debate around the size of things and asset size, and i thought richard's proposal around the division of function and sort of a glass-steagall type proposal is really interesting, and i feel like you haven't addressed that, so i'd like to hear your opinion on that. %$* 19
so-- %$* 13
can you come with that-- %$* 13
with like a one-sentence question? %$* 13
what do you think-- %$* 19
no, i think i got it. %$* 18
what do you think about splitting up the big space on function as opposed to size? %$* 19
sure. %$* 255
i’d be happy-- %$* 255
doug elliott. %$* 13
be happy to give you some thoughts on it. %$* 255
and i will in one second. %$* 255
the only reason we've been so focused on the other point is that is the actual point of the debate. %$* 255
and it's kind of a sleight of hand to say, "we think that once you do this thing, it will change the whole economics so much that we know that it will achieve the same effect."i understand there's an argument for it that's far from proof. %$* 255
but coming back to your question, i happen to oppose re-imposing something like the full version of glass- steagall-- %$* 255
i know paul does as well-- %$* 255
because the world has changed immensely. %$* 255
glass- steagall didn't even work 20-some years ago because already by that point the principal difference that glass- steagall focused on, the difference between a security and a loan had become extremely unclear and irrelevant because the bank-- %$* 255
the big companies that we're talking about here, all they wanted was to efficiently get credit. %$* 255
and they wanted to be able to do that through the markets, and they wanted to be able to do it through the banks. %$* 255
and banks are important parts of the market as well. %$* 255
so they sit in the middle where they can help with either side of this. %$* 255
to arbitrarily break it up-- %$* 255
first of all, it will be really arbitrary. %$* 255
i don't even know how you define a loan versus a security now. %$* 255
it just-- %$* 255
you can't do it in this world. %$* 255
if you do, it'll be a very arbitrary choice. %$* 255
so let me ask the question, if i may-- %$* 253
please. %$* 255
yes, richard fisher. %$* 13
should the taxpayer guarantee those loans? %$* 253
bad loan, should a taxpayer guarantee a bad loan made by a mega institution, a too big to fail bank, a sifi? %$* 253
no. %$* 256
no, it's not what we’re proposing. %$* 255
well, all i've said is that the only thing i want the taxpayer exposed to is protecting the savings that are deposited in the commercial bank of a complex bank holding company. %$* 253
do you disagree or do you agree? %$* 253
that's actually a different thing from-- %$* 255
doug, do you disagree or do you agree? %$* 253
say it again because i want to make sure i understand. %$* 255
have you done courtroom work? %$* 13
or are you just watching a lot of shows? %$* 13
we guarantee the banking system. %$* 253
taxpayers guarantee the banking system. %$* 253
our proposal is to limit the guarantee strictly to the commercial banking operation that takes the savings of the people and then invests it in loans. %$* 253
would you disagree with that or agree with it? %$* 253
i think that is where the guarantee should be. %$* 255
it is where the-- %$* 255
good. %$* 253
guarantee is now. %$* 255
good. %$* 253
you-- %$* 255
you're arguing a different point. %$* 255
no, because if jpmorgan were to fail because of a-- %$* 253
let's take jpmorgan as xyz bank were to fail and xyz bank was jpmorgan-- %$* 253
because of a rogue trader in london called "the whale" who took an enormous risk, should we bail them out? %$* 253
no, and we didn't. %$* 256
why are we looking at the london whale as the-- %$* 256
paul saltzman. %$* 13
reason for how the system worked? %$* 256
who was penalized? %$* 256
the shareholders. %$* 256
yeah, that's right. %$* 18
who was penalized? %$* 256
management. %$* 256
look at the newspaper. %$* 256
that's an example not of a system broken. %$* 256
that's a system working. %$* 256
if jamie dimon-- %$* 254
simon johnson. %$* 13
jamie dimon went to see the attorney general just now to discuss the london whale. %$* 254
jamie dimon went to see-- %$* 254
oh, you were there, simon. %$* 256
you were there. %$* 256
simon, simon, simon, tell our radio listeners what the london whale is. %$* 13
the london whale was a trading operation, an individual, a group of individuals in london, lost a lot of money on bad derivative bets and, according to a concession publically made by jpmorgan today, there was market manipulation involved in that transaction. %$* 254
but the point is, jamie dimon went to discuss his legal problems with eric holder, the attorney general. %$* 254
i can assure you, you will not get to see the attorney general should you get into any legal problems. %$* 254
that is-- %$* 254
there's only one company, according to public justice, there's only one company, as far as they can recall, that has been to see the attorney general. %$* 254
i want to remind you-- %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section. %$* 13
well, paul said the system's working perfectly. %$* 254
i want to remind you we're in the question and answer section. %$* 13
i'll do this in a second. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donovan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have floor debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: "break up the big banks." sir. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
jonathan reese it's funny-- %$* 18
do you mind standing? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
thank you very much. %$* 13
jonathan reese. %$* 18
it's funny that eric holders' name just came up, because he also said before congress that the size of the banks was problematic in terms of prosecuting them. %$* 18
he then took it back because it had kind of slipped out and he didn't want to admit to that, but-- %$* 18
he did say that. %$* 18
do you find that troubling? %$* 18
paul saltzman. %$* 13
yes i did. %$* 256
yes i do. %$* 256
no bank, no individual, no company should be too big to put in jail if they've violated the law, okay? %$* 256
that's point number one. %$* 256
number two, have you read the newspapers lately? %$* 256
okay? %$* 256
do you think banks aren't being prosecuted every day and probably for political reasons? %$* 256
eleven billion dollars of fines being suggested for activity that occurred prior to the acquisition of the companies that the government suggested they acquire? %$* 256
so this notion that somehow banks are immune from prosecution is just simply not true. %$* 256
no bank should be too big to jail. %$* 256
no one who has violated the law should be immune. %$* 256
that's my position, and i would assume it's the position of the other debaters around this table. %$* 256
if you remember there was the pbs documentary in which the deputy attorney general who is responsible for bringing prosecution actually said on camera that they've been reluctant to bring not just against jpmorgan chase, other large financial institutions, they've been reluctant to bring the prosecutions. %$* 254
that gentleman left office very soon after that statement came out on television. %$* 254
look, it's a very uncomfortable statement about american society and the american legal system, but honestly, that is where we are today. %$* 254
these banks are too big to prosecute effectively. %$* 254
sir, in the center. %$* 13
no, behind you. %$* 13
gray jacket. %$* 13
and remember to stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
i’m a student at blair. %$* 18
so you're a student at blair? %$* 13
tell us about blair for just a second. %$* 13
is there a whole group of you here? %$* 13
yeah, there's a small group of us here right in the middle. %$* 18
are you the debating team? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
well, a few of us are captains of a debating team, and-- %$* 18
congratulations. %$* 13
thanks for coming. %$* 13
well, this question is for-- %$* 18
this question is for the for side. %$* 18
in the scenario that you've proposed of the splitting of the big banks, how do you think the market will react to the splitting of these economic giants? %$* 18
richard fisher. %$* 13

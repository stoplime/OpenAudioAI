in a new republic article that came out some time ago, i'm sorry, the new york times-- %$* 459
new york-- %$* 459
one of those. %$* 13
article. %$* 459
new yorker magazine was the article. %$* 459
it documented-- %$* 459
john, start that again for the editing later on. %$* 13
you're taking out our-- %$* 462
for radio. %$* 13
in a recent authoritative article which appeared in the new yorker, they studied where healthcare costs are the highest. %$* 459
and interestingly, they found that the highest place for healthcare costs in america is a little town called mcallen, texas. %$* 459
and they went to mcallen, texas, and tried to find out why are costs so high. %$* 459
and what they found was a couple of different factors. %$* 459
number one, they found that doctors in fact do prescribe lots of procedures that are unnecessary. %$* 459
and they do so in mcallen, texas. %$* 459
they noted that, for example, great healthcare centers do not prescribe that many procedures. %$* 459
and so they figured out there needed to be a way. %$* 459
they actually began interviewing doctors. %$* 459
and they said, you know what? %$* 459
in the current system, we are not incentivized to control costs. %$* 459
why are they not incentivized to control costs? %$* 459
because nobody's watching the store. %$* 459
the reality is-- %$* 459
but you’re agreeing with that sort of monitoring. %$* 13
as paul said, if the consumer isn't paying the bill, then nobody's watching. %$* 459
yeah, yeah. %$* 460
and in this circumstance, yeah, if you're sick, you're not making the decision. %$* 459
but right now, your family could be making that decision. %$* 459
but right now under the current system and under obamacare, you will not be making that cost decision because you're cut out of the process. %$* 459
so i'm having this very disoriented feeling listening to a lot of this because you're stealing some of my talking points here. %$* 462
maybe-- %$* 462
i love to do that. %$* 459
but, no, i agree. %$* 462
that article was very influential. %$* 462
actually president obama was known to have read it. %$* 462
he did. %$* 459
he handed it around to his staff. %$* 462
and i think most people who study the healthcare system agree that, you know, one of the weird things about our healthcare system is you have these bizarre regional variations. %$* 462
so you go to some parts of the country, and they're doing all kinds of extra procedures, and other parts of the country, they're not. %$* 462
and why is that? %$* 462
well, the people who wrote this bill, they all read that article. %$* 462
they all know this. %$* 462
and the article actually built on years and years of studies showing that and it’s very specifically designed to help address that problem. %$* 462
and there're all kinds of ways it does. %$* 462
i mean, it would be-- %$* 462
i would love to be able to sit here and say, here is the silver bullet that will change it. %$* 462
because that's what he thinks. %$* 462
“oh, you know, if we just give everyone choice, you know, if we give everyone the consumer power it will somehow sort this all out.” well, good luck with that. %$* 462
i mean, i don't know about you. %$* 462
but the last time my kid was sick, it took me three hours on webmd to figure out even what the symptoms were. %$* 462
did you-- %$* 13
do you just not like what you're hearing, or did you have a question to follow? %$* 13
40 percent of all healthcare costs, so-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to pass on to another question. %$* 13
this gentleman right in the center. %$* 13
you've been very patient. %$* 13
here. %$* 13
i'd sort of like to get to the heart of the cost things because i think there's a little bit of denial going on. %$* 18
an early mentor said to me if the financial analysis defies common sense, go with common sense. %$* 18
so now we get 35 million new people coming into medicaid. %$* 18
we've got baby boomers retiring in droves going into the medicare program. %$* 18
and we've got all that intercepting with all advancements in care and treatments, procedures and drugs which extend life and make life more livable. %$* 18
and a big underpinning, a big way that the obama bill is going to get this under control is by slowing the cost of medicare and medicaid. %$* 18
i believe the number is about-- %$* 18
so can you focus to a question. %$* 13
pardon me? %$* 18
can you focus to a question, having studied your premise. %$* 13
well, yeah, yeah, yeah. %$* 18
here's what i think is going to happen. %$* 18
i want you to tell me it's not. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
that will result-- %$* 18
there's a videotape of every president since richard nixon saying they're going to solve this problem by getting waste and fraud out of the system. %$* 18
i think it's going to reduce reimbursements. %$* 18
and i think that's going to drive more and more of the better docs out of the system. %$* 18
it's already happening. %$* 18
where i live in sarasota, florida-- %$* 18
i need a question, please. %$* 13
tell me why that's not going to happen and why it's not going to hurt the people at the bottom of our economic scale. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
jonathan cohn, who is against repeal. %$* 13
very quickly on this question about physician-- %$* 462
and what you're-- %$* 462
if i understand what you're saying, your last question there is about if we're going to spend less on medicare, if medicare is going to pay less, then why won't doctors just leave the system? %$* 462
well, we've done reductions in medicare like this before. %$* 462
we've done reductions larger than the ones we've done before. %$* 462
and by the way, during the mccain campaign, mr. %$* 462
holtz- eakin, i remember, very vividly, saying that they were going to pay for their healthcare plan by enacting medicare cuts that were even larger. %$* 462
now, i don't think he was trying to deprive medicare patients of access. %$* 462
but the fact is we've had these cuts before. %$* 462
and every time it happens, you hear a lot of predictions, oh, my god, people are going to stop seeing medicare patients. %$* 462
and i understand that. %$* 462
look, my father is a surgeon. %$* 462
he's in south florida where you see people walking around with little dollar signs because there are cataract surgeries and, you know, that's what it's like. %$* 462
and i understand that. %$* 462
the fact is, every single time that we have done this, there have been predictions that doctors are going to flee the system. %$* 462
and you'll always get the anecdotal, of course, this doctor is leaving that-- %$* 462
but the medicare payment advisory committee looks at this. %$* 462
there's a government, independent, not partisan authority that looks at these statistics to monitor this, because they want to make sure that's not happening. %$* 462
there's a group called the center for the study of healthcare system change, which is the longest acronym ever for a think tank. %$* 462
but believe me, they're very reliable, totally nonpartisan. %$* 462
everyone trusts-- %$* 462
and what they all found is it never happens. %$* 462
the doctors have not left the system. %$* 462
douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
i want to, first, stipulate late, that the place they send old cbo directors to die is the medicare payment advisory commission. %$* 461
i've been there. %$* 461
and prospectively, the medpac as well as the cms actuary would say that the kinds of cuts and vision for medicare will either lead to inadequate care, inability to see providers, or you can go put the money back in. %$* 461
so there are no real changes in the business model that would allow a physician to practice more cheaply in medicare, and that is why we should have fixed the problem instead of written the checks that is this system. %$* 461
i think that is the fundamental indictment, we are not fixing the problem, and it is important to recognize that although there's all these bells and whistles that jonathan likes to point to, there are lots of pages, they don't have any teeth. %$* 461
they put something in called the "independent payment advisory board," that's like medpac on steroids, and-- %$* 461
but the law says they can't make beneficiaries pay more, they can't touch the hospitals and the nursing homes for 10 years, they can't mess with the way the docs get paid, so where's the big change in the way the delivery system's going to happen? %$* 461
let's go to the audience for more questions. %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
can you stand, please? %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
and just give a second for the camera to find you. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
i am retired psychiatric social worker, and i haven't really heard much about the pain and suffering, it's cost, cost, and i know money's an issue, but i haven't heard the human side of this at all, and it's very dismaying. %$* 19
the other thing is, what about the issue of americans are not taking very good care of themselves and they say 75 percent of the health issues of course are people's bad habits, or a lot of them. %$* 19
but do you think that's about a law? %$* 13
well, no, but, i mean, but a law, i mean, i think one of the things obamacare wanted to do was try to get people to take care of themselves better and reward, you know, doctors who concentrate on prevention, and change of habits, and diet, and exercise. %$* 19
and that’s a very important-- %$* 19
paul starr, is there any traction in that argument? %$* 13
and i’ll come back to you, john. %$* 13
well, there are a number of measures in the bill that promote preventive services but-- %$* 460
and they are very important. %$* 460
medicare beneficiaries will get preventive services that have never been covered before. %$* 460
those are some of the terrible mandates for private insurance that’s going to have to cover vaccinations, things like that. %$* 460
but, you know, i’m not counting on that for big savings. %$* 460
i don’t think the government really can change personal behavior in that profound a way, and i-- %$* 460
personally, actually, i don’t want to change that. %$* 460
i bet, john shadegg, you agree with that point? %$* 13
i don’t think government can change personal behavior, but i think law can change personal behavior because right now this system does not incentivize you or i to take care of ourselves. %$* 459
there are companies that have looked at this. %$* 459
safeway, for example, has said, “you know what? %$* 459
having obese employees, having employees with out of control blood pressure, having employees with severe cholesterol is a severe problem," and so they’ve gone in and they have %$* 459
john, you’re talking about the system that existed prior to the reform, or you’re talking about the reform plan does not address these issues? %$* 13
the reform plan says government’s going to do it. %$* 459
what i’m saying is you have to incentivize people to do it, and the way you can incentivize people to do it is to give them skin in the game. %$* 459
actually, safeway cuts the cost of its employees’ healthcare if they lower their blood pressure, or if they consistently take their cholesterol medicine. %$* 459
we can’t-- %$* 459
may i just say so does the walt disney company, of which i am an employee. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 459
i take the human side of this argument very, very seriously. %$* 459
when we were kids growing up, our parents bought indemnity plans, and the doctors cared about us because there was a physician-patient relationship. %$* 459
we put the cash on their table. %$* 459
the system we have created now divorces us completely from our doctor. %$* 459
it says your doctor isn’t hired by you, your doctor is hired by a plan who was hired by your employer. %$* 459
and that is what has caused medicine to-- %$* 459
caused damage to the physician-patient relationship, it’s caused a loss of control in costs, and it has caused the kind of devastation that you’re talking about. %$* 459
i know people that can’t afford care because the insurance companies don’t give a damn about what it cares. %$* 459
it’s time to stop shoveling money to them and put the power and control in your hands, not to give it to the government so secretary sebelius could write a thousand new regulations. %$* 459
that’s not going to make it more personal, and then the plan i propose covers every single american, every one. %$* 459
i think you agree with most of that. %$* 13
do i agree that i-- %$* 462
i think that people sometimes are at the mercy of their insurance company? %$* 462
absolutely, and that is why i support this bill and don’t think we should repeal it. %$* 462
i mean, remember right now your insurance company says you can’t get that treatment, you’re stuck. %$* 462
right now you’re moving between insurance companies-- %$* 462
you know, you're-- %$* 462
right now you're moving between insurance company and insurance company, you change plans and tomorrow you have to change doctors because they’re not in the same network. %$* 462
this plan allows people to stay on the same insurance plan longer and when that denial comes down, guess what? %$* 462
you can appeal it. %$* 462
what a notion. %$* 462
you can actually go to an impartial person and say “you know what? %$* 462
they’re saying i can’t get this premium because they think it’s too expensive. %$* 462
i think i have the medical evidence that it works,” and the board says, “you know what? %$* 462
you’re right.” that’s a mandate. %$* 462
that’s a regulation, and you know what? %$* 462
it helps people. %$* 462
yeah. %$* 13
you just raised your right hand. %$* 13
will you stand up and the mic will come to you, thanks. %$* 13
can i ask you what you’re hearing so far that in any way changed your mind? %$* 13
it hasn’t changed my mind. %$* 19
it’s been a lot of the same rhetoric i think. %$* 19
but i keep hearing always the proponents of repealing the law about consumer choice and way before this law they kept talking about consumer choice will lower costs. %$* 19
and i want to ask you if you really believe that a parent with a child that needs heart surgery is going to choose the cheapest heart surgeon and the cheapest hospital. %$* 19
and when your father’s dying of prostate cancer they’re going to choose to not give four months of very expensive treatment and thus lower cost. %$* 19
that’s a question for the side arguing for repeal. %$* 13
i’m going to give you a bad answer and i will hand it over to mr. %$* 461
shadegg. %$* 461
this is what i would say to you. %$* 461
healthcare is not a one thing. %$* 461
it’s not just the circumstances tragic and threatening as you described. %$* 461
healthcare and where we spend this is an enormous range that involves elective procedures, it involves chronic conditions, it involves traumatic injury and we have a system that does not provide individuals with anything like the ability to manage their care, anything like information needed to choose from high and low value care and never gets them in a preventive way in a position to avoid being stuck with a tragic choice. %$* 461
that’s wrong. %$* 461
we need a system that they control all aspects of their life cycle up to those very moments. %$* 461
and i have a great faith in the ability of the american people. %$* 461
they do it in every other aspect of their lives some of which are enormous, they have kids. %$* 461
that’s a pretty life and death situation. %$* 461
paul starr who is against repeal. %$* 13
i have great faith in the ability to do it. %$* 461
paul starr who is against repeal. %$* 13
well, i agree with the sympathies of the questioner that there’s something really fundamentally amiss here, this image of the patient as economic man. %$* 460
how really out of touch it is with the conditions of illness. %$* 460
how, in fact, it assumes a kind of marketplace where, for example, prices would be available. %$* 460
actually, you can’t find out what the prices are for different things. %$* 460
and in fact a hospital has 12 different prices for the same thing depending on who it’s treating. %$* 460
we don’t have a system of posted prices in healthcare. %$* 460
now, maybe you want to change all that. %$* 460
maybe you want to transform it but you were in power for years and you didn’t do anything about it. %$* 460
john shadegg. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 459
the decision point that you referred to, once they’ve gotten sick, is not the right one. %$* 459
the reality is people are economic beings and they do make economic decisions. %$* 459
indeed, i proposed a bill in the united states congress that would allow you if you live in new jersey to buy a plan that was written and offered for sale in arizona or idaho or illinois or connecticut. %$* 459
no, no. %$* 459
let me explain how it works. %$* 459
you could buy that policy-- %$* 459
and the reason i wrote that bill is because the people in new jersey today pay at least four times more than the people in pennsylvania because of those strictures of the law in new jersey. %$* 459
indeed, americans who go to new jersey are going to their friends that live in pennsylvania and say, “what are you paying? %$* 459
and they’re saying “well, i’m paying one-fourth of what you’re paying.” and people are actually buying health insurance by pretending they live in pennsylvania when they really live in new jersey because it costs one-fourth as much. %$* 459
now we heard the argument that nobody would shop but people really do shop. %$* 459
but here’s why shopping-- %$* 459
ah-- %$* 459
if they can shop-- %$* 459
what makes me maddest about all of this- - %$* 459
to quote you, you’re saying from the audience, cheaper premiums do not mean cheaper healthcare. %$* 13
john, respond to that. %$* 13
the ability, for example, to buy across lines. %$* 459
people are not going to pay, are not going to choose to pay cheaper premiums unless they have to. %$* 459
what they’re going to do is pay, they’re going to spend as much as they can on healthcare and get the best product they can. %$* 459
they won’t choose to buy a cheap policy, some may, but most people buy the most expensive policy they can. %$* 459
in fact, that was a study done on my bill allowing across state line health insurance sales and indeed, no less than the department of health and human services said if you simply allowed cross state sales of health insurance we would have eight million fewer people uninsured in america today. %$* 459
now, here's the point. %$* 459
it's not-- %$* 459
the key isn't that you will be able to get a cheaper policy. %$* 459
the problem is the insurance companies are cheating us right now. %$* 459
they're charging too much because they don't have to compete. %$* 459
okay-- %$* 13
the reality is-- %$* 459
on the far right. %$* 13
you're standing in the aisle and making yourself known. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
hi. %$* 19
i know we're here to discuss to repeal or not to repeal. %$* 19
but that is not the question. %$* 19
i think the central question should be-- %$* 19
and it is also my question to you, what is our path to a truly universal, affordable healthcare system? %$* 19
because whether we have the affordable care act or whether we have the status quo, both systems are asking us to put our faith in the private health insurance industry which is profit driven. %$* 19
and life and death matters should not be decided by the profit motive. %$* 19
so that what is the path-- %$* 19
what is the path to an improved medicare system open to all? %$* 19
repealing obamacare is the question. %$* 13
but given your passion and verve, i'd just like to give each side 30 seconds each to respond to that. %$* 13
and either of you can take it from there. %$* 13
this law reflects a conviction that we can regulate a private system, not just private insurers, but also private hospitals, private doctors, and achieve the goals that you're interested in, a universal system. %$* 460
and in fact, really, if you look at other countries, they're not all government controlled. %$* 460
they have many private insurance funds in many european countries and achieve a universal-- %$* 460
thank you. %$* 13
on this side. %$* 13
douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
there's nothing about insurance companies, per se, that anyone should like. %$* 461
but the alternative, a monopoly that you have to deal with, is completely inferior to having a vibrant insurance industry that has to compete for your business. %$* 461
i would much rather force them to give me a decent service than have a mandate that i have to use the one that's supplied by the government. %$* 461
the second thing is, remember, for those advocates of a single big national payer, a national payer cannot negotiate any better between one hospital in wichita and another hospital in wichita which is ultimately where you have to negotiate who can provide this care at the cheapest price. %$* 461
they can't do it any better than the guy in wichita. %$* 461
so there is literally no advantage to a national plan. %$* 461
it's a charade. %$* 461
john shadegg, your partner. %$* 13
your goal is my-- %$* 459
all right. %$* 13
debaters are here on this one. %$* 13
john shadegg, very quickly. %$* 13
your goal is my goal. %$* 459
long ago, i embraced universal coverage. %$* 459
one point we haven't talked about tonight very much is how many people are going to lose the coverage they have. %$* 459
you said how do we get to that right healthcare system. %$* 459
i'll tell you how. %$* 459
number one, allow the people that like their plan to keep their plan. %$* 459
number two, deal with the issue of the uninsured by giving them a refundable tax credit. %$* 459
give them cash-- %$* 459
john, you've made this point before so i'm going to-- %$* 13
in the interest of time, i'm going to move on. %$* 13
one more question. %$* 13
and, ma'am, purple scarf, yeah. %$* 13
my question is, why should we not trust our elected officials? %$* 19
why, if people have their lives in public service-- %$* 19
well, i mean, you were voted into office. %$* 19
why should we not? %$* 19
i lived in great britain for 25 years. %$* 19
i was a beneficiary of the national health service as well as private medicine. %$* 19
but there was an implicit trust that my tax pounds from my paycheck would help subsidize healthcare. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
but i trusted that they would, regardless of whether they were labor or conservative. %$* 19
and same in this country, republican, democrats, we're all-- %$* 19
so your question is why be so suspicious and skeptical of the ability of the bureaucracy to do the job well. %$* 13
i want to put that-- %$* 13
bureaucracy-- %$* 19
people who have devoted their lives to public service who are elected officials, because some americans-- %$* 19
the elected officials. %$* 13
let's put that to the side that's arguing to repeal. %$* 13
john shadegg. %$* 13
i think we should trust them. %$* 459
however, in this instance, we didn't. %$* 459
and point of fact, when obamacare passed, it was opposed by roughly 54 percent of the american people. %$* 459
each day it's opposed by somewhere closer to 60 percent of the people. %$* 459
there is no poll out there yet that says that it's favored by more people than not. %$* 459
but more importantly than that-- %$* 459
and this is a key point-- %$* 459
when a nation that is a democracy makes a radical change in public policy, it should be reflected not by the narrowest of consensus but by a very broad consensus. %$* 459
when social security was adopted, more than 80 percent of the members of the congress, house and senate, voted for the creation of social security. %$* 459
when medicare and medicare were created, more than 70 percent of the members of congress supported those programs. %$* 459
when schip was adopted, again, the numbers were well over 75 percent of the members of congress. %$* 459
okay. %$* 13
when this bill passed, it passed by the slimmest of margins. %$* 459
in the house, 50.8 percent, purely partisan vote. %$* 459
and without the kind of consensus that i think will make it sustainable. %$* 459
jonathan cohn. %$* 13
if it were sustainable, we wouldn't be having this debate. %$* 459
jonathan cohn, 30 seconds. %$* 13
okay. %$* 462
very quickly, the polls-- %$* 462
if you scratch those polls even a little bit, what you will find is that it's a country overall. %$* 462
do you like the healthcare reform? %$* 462
yes, no, about divided. %$* 462
ask the people who don't like it, do you think it should be repealed and just we should go back to the way we were, or make it stronger? %$* 462
about half the people break off, say, “oh, no, we want it to be stronger.” and if you test the individual elements, they're wildly popular-- %$* 462
protection against pre-existing conditions, getting kids under 25 on parents’ insurance. %$* 462
all of these things are wildly popular. %$* 462
and yes, it's true, the republican party did not-- %$* 462
this was a closed vote. %$* 462
you know why that is? %$* 462
it's because we live in a world not like the one 20, 30 years ago, where you had a responsible republican party, where you had moderate republicans-- %$* 462
oh. %$* 459
ooh! %$* 459
just like, as my colleague said. %$* 462
the ideas in this plan were virtually identical in the broad framework to what the republicans were proposing just 12 years ago. %$* 462
it's what mitt romney said. %$* 462
this is not a radical plan. %$* 462
john shadegg, equal time for you on that. %$* 13
i think it's offensive to say that the republican party is irresponsible. %$* 459
you know, i'm sorry. %$* 459
i take offense at that. %$* 459
i have offered healthcare reform bills every year i've been in congress. %$* 459
there are many. %$* 459
i'm sorry the woman over there didn't hear them. %$* 459
yes, republicans passed the opportunity when they hold both majorities of congress. %$* 459
but quite frankly, we did not have the demand that we have now seen. %$* 459
but how do you defend the fact that broad consensus is necessary to support this legislation? %$* 459
have you defended it other than to say-- %$* 459
other than to say, well, back then, the republican party was responsible, and now it's not. %$* 459
that's really-- %$* 459
quite frankly, in the context of what happened last week, inappropriate. %$* 459
when you pass the medicare prescription drug program-- %$* 460
paul starr. %$* 13
when you pass the medicare prescription drug program, the polls ran two to one against it among seniors and the general population. %$* 460
eighty percent of people in polls said this is too complicated. %$* 460
you did it anyway. %$* 460
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing remarks from each of the debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and it's their last chance to try to change your minds to their point of view. %$* 13
our motion is "repeal obamacare." you've been asked to vote once. %$* 13
and we'll ask you to vote again in just a couple of minutes. %$* 13
but first, round three. %$* 13
round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be brief. %$* 13
and first, to speak against our motion, “repeal obamacare,” against repeal, paul starr, professor at princeton university, cofounder and coeditor of the american prospect and pulitzer prize winning author of “the social transformation of american medicine.” %$* 13
thank you. %$* 460
two months ago, the editor of an austrian newspaper, a conservative, by the way, asked me how americans could possibly oppose giving health insurance to the millions who don't have it. %$* 460
to europeans across the political spectrum, it's unthinkable to withhold health insurance, just as we would regard it as unthinkable to deny an education to children. %$* 460
the austrians, the french, the germans, who have excellent medical care, don't become uninsurable when they get ill. %$* 460
they don't get locked into a job for fear of losing health coverage. %$* 460
universal coverage makes it more secure, and it actually makes them more free. %$* 460
but every time the issue of universal coverage has arisen here, the opponents have used innuendo and fear to defeat health reforms that are common to every other advanced democracy. %$* 460
and last year, we finally broke through that drum beat of fear with moderate legislation and to creating a more just and efficient system to cover the excluded and create mechanisms to slow the growth in costs. %$* 460
repealing the law would mean denying coverage to more than 30 million people. %$* 460
it would mean repealing the laws' protections against abusive insurance practices, some of which have already gone into effect like barring the rescission of policies just because the subscriber gets sick. %$* 460
it would mean giving up a whole series of cost-containment measures that show a lot of promise for reign in medical inflation. %$* 460
but even more importantly, repeal would be a concession of political helplessness in the face of a problem that has nagged at the national conscience for a century. %$* 460
it would be a confession that we simply are not capable of the elementary decency toward the sick that characterizes every other advanced democracy. %$* 460
there are surely changes that should be made in the law. %$* 460
and it can be made. %$* 460
but it would be an unspeakable tragedy for millions of people if we were to repeal it. %$* 460
thank you, paul starr. %$* 13
our motion is "repeal obamacare." and here to speak for the motion, for repeal, john shadegg, former eight-term congressman from arizona and a senior fellow at the goldwater institute. %$* 13
the current system is broken. %$* 459
there is no question about it. %$* 459
it's broken because it costs too much, it's broken because there are too many people who don't have insurance, and it's tragically broken because some people are denied care because they have a chronic illness or preexisting condition. %$* 459
we need to address those problems, and there are lots of reforms that we can to address them. %$* 459
we can allow group pooling. %$* 459
we can force the insurance companies to become cost conscious and to have to compete with each other. %$* 459
we can give you control over your health insurance. %$* 459
we can move away from third party payer systems. %$* 459
and we can begin to redo the system. %$* 459
but we don't have to say that it's not universal care. %$* 459
indeed, my legislation and other legislation that republicans have offered provide universal coverage. %$* 459
my legislation says you give every single american a tax credit. %$* 459
for the poor, you give them a refundable tax credit, an amount of money. %$* 459
in the coburn legislation and the ryan legislation, you write specific dollar amounts for people to buy health insurance, and it's cash in their hands to go buy a coverage that they choose. %$* 459
so we achieve universal coverage, every single american. %$* 459
you can do universal enrollment as i described, where you're automatically enrolled in that process. %$* 459
we can deal with the problem of the uninsured without forcing a million americans who like their current coverage to lose it, which is what obamacare will do. %$* 459
you will force millions of americans to lose the coverage they currently have and they currently like. %$* 459
and we can deal with the problem of preexisting conditions. %$* 459
i had heart bypass surgery. %$* 459
i have a preexisting condition. %$* 459
i care about this issue. %$* 459
i have an older sister-- %$* 459
my oldest sister, who has breast cancer. %$* 459
no one should be denied healthcare because they have a preexisting condition. %$* 459
but we can do that without forcing everybody out of the coverage they have now. %$* 459
but rather by creating high risk pools that are funded by all the other insurance companies or by government, and helping those who are in need because they have high risks. %$* 459
americans will happily pay to support people who have that kind of condition because they don’t know when they will have it next. %$* 459
high risk pools will work for those with preexisting conditions. %$* 459
john-- %$* 13
john shadegg, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is, "repeal obamacare." and to speak in his closing remarks against the motion, jonathan cohn, senior editor at the new republic, senior fellow at demos, and author of "sick: the untold story of america’s healthcare crisis and the people who pay the price." %$* 13
there was a question at some point that talked about the human side to this, and i wanted to just take this and say that’s where i started. %$* 462
about 15 years ago i started interviewing people all over the country, and i met people who had their own firsthand experiences with the healthcare system, and i remember very, very vividly a man in upstate new york who had a good job, a good college education, was a defense contractor, he lost that job, he got the job back, but without benefits, and because of that, two years his wife who was ill did not get any medical visits, ended up she had cancer, it went undiagnosed, she died, and the family had to declare bankruptcy. %$* 462
for me, hearing that story and literally hundreds like it is where this all starts for me. %$* 462
this is a problem we have had in this country for a long time. %$* 462
it is a problem that keeps getting worse. %$* 462
two years ago we had a presidential election. %$* 462
and we debated, what are we going to do about this? %$* 462
one, president obama won, the democrats got in and this was job number one. %$* 462
they reached out to the republicans. %$* 462
they took ideas that republicans had for years claimed as their own and said, "all right, we’ll meet you halfway, and we’ll try-- %$* 462
we will come up with a plan that builds on your ideas and our ideas and we’ll work together." and the republicans walked away, and they said, "fine. %$* 462
we have to go it alone, we’ll go it alone." but they kept the same ideas, they took the best from left and right, and what did they get? %$* 462
it’s not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that will mean 30 million people have health insurance. %$* 462
it will mean that the insurance people have will be good insurance that will cover what they need. %$* 462
it will mean that people will have financial assistance. %$* 462
congressman shadegg never tells you this part of his plan, but the credit he would offer people isn’t enough to pay for a good plan and people with pre-existing conditions, it would basically work out to second class insurance for second class people. %$* 462
this is the plan they're talking about. %$* 462
the cost control, not perfect, it could be better, fine, as doug holtz-eakin, himself, said, these are the same ideas, we all agree on them, let's work together and double them down. %$* 462
but repeal obamacare? %$* 462
tom harkin said, "this is a starter house, it’s got a good foundation, and it’s got room for expansion." i say let’s keep that foundation, let’s build onto it, and let’s not repeal obamacare, let’s not start over, let’s go forward. %$* 462
thank you, jonathan cohn. %$* 13
our motion is "repeal obamacare." and finally, to speak for the motion, for repeal, douglas holtz-eakin, who is president of the american action forum and a former director of the congressional budget office and former advisor to john mccain. %$* 13
i thank you for listening tonight and this is ultimately a debate about our future and i don’t think anyone should question the aspirations or good will of either side of this stage in terms of what one would like in affordable coverage for every american and access to high quality care. %$* 461
those values are shared. %$* 461
what is at issue is what is the best way to go forward and to try to build on this foundation, one that is riddled with financial cancer and one that has only window dressing at attempting to deal with the real problems of the american healthcare system is a dangerous place to begin and it should be repealed in favor of a real future of the american healthcare system. %$* 461
now, we’ve heard that somehow the republicans got all their ideas and i believe that the vigorous debate tonight would stipulate that’s not the case. %$* 461
this is not something on which we can build a future. %$* 461
this is a dangerous beginning. %$* 461
it does not fix the broken programs that are threatening the financial future of the united states. %$* 461
medicare and medicaid are not touched by this program. %$* 461
they are important pieces of the social welfare system in the united states. %$* 461
they deserved the attention of the healthcare reform. %$* 461
they were dismissed as unimportant. %$* 461
instead we got a strategy to double down on those broken failures and try to write checks to paper over a broken system and in the process we are threatening the very future of this country, threatening the freedom and prosperity of americans on which the healthcare system and everything else will be built. %$* 461
and we are most tragically doing it at the expense of our youngest and most vulnerable, our kids. %$* 461
they didn’t get a vote. %$* 461
they aren’t going to be able to believe what we have done to them when they grow up. %$* 461
they will pay the bills now. %$* 461
they will pay the bills later. %$* 461
they won’t see higher quality care. %$* 461
they’ll see more expensive care. %$* 461
and we will, in the process, take many of them into systems that ostensibly give them “access” but where no physician can treat them, no hospital will want them in their beds and they will not get good care and they will be broke to boot. %$* 461
repeal obamacare today. %$* 461
thank you, douglas holtz-eakin and that concludes our closing statements and now it’s time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we’re having you vote twice, once before the debate and again after the debate and we’re going to get the results and choose the winner. %$* 13
we’re asking you to go to the keypad at your seat. %$* 13
our motion is “repeal obamacare.” if you agree with the motion after hearing the debate, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you remain undecided or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we’ll have the results of that vote in about 90 seconds but before we get to that, i just want to thank both teams for coming to this debate with the kind of arguments that they did. %$* 13
we aspire to ideas here and we certainly heard them tonight. %$* 13
thank you to all of our debaters for the way that they conducted themselves and did this-- %$* 13
thank you also to those of you in the audience who asked questions. %$* 13
i like your passion. %$* 13
i’m glad that question got in there. %$* 13
thank you for doing that, for forcing that issue. %$* 13
we’d like to first of all thank the american clean skies foundation for helping to underwrite this season of debates. %$* 13
this season we have a theme throughout the winter and the spring for all five of our debates. %$* 13
that theme is “america’s house divided” and we are focusing on themes that reflect this division, this basic philosophical division in our society. %$* 13
our next debate is tuesday, february 15th. %$* 13
the motion on that tuesday night is “two party system is making america ungovernable.” arguing for the motion are new york times op/ed columnist david brook and co-founder and editor-in-chief of huffington post, arianna huffington. %$* 13
against the motion we have zev chaffets who is a journalist and he’s the former director of the government press office in israel where the system is a parliamentary system and works differently. %$* 13
his partner arguing against the motion is p.j.o’rourke, a political satirist and author of “don’t vote, it just encourages the bastards.” tickets to those debates are available through our web site and at the skirball box office and do not forget to follow the intelligence squared u.s.on twitter and to make sure to become a fan on facebook. %$* 13

it’s over now. %$* 13
i have been given the results. %$* 13
remember you have been asked to vote twice in this debate, once before and once again at the end. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds is declared our winner. %$* 13
and here it is. %$* 13
our motion is "repeal obamacare." before the debate, 17 percent were for repeal. %$* 13
47 percent against, 36 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 22 percent are for “repeal obamacare.” that's up five percent. %$* 13
seventy-two percent are against. %$* 13
that's up 25 percent. %$* 13
six percent are undecided. %$* 13
the motion, “repeal obamacare” is defeated. %$* 13
that's it for us at intelligence squared. %$* 13
thank you from john donvan, and we'll see you next time. %$* 13

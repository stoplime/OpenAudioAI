it is a very doable mission. %$* 89
one more question. %$* 494
and please, a brief one and direct it to one of the panelists. %$* 494
i have a question over here. %$* 10
actually, unfortunately, it’s a very general question, which is i’m getting more and more confused as this discussion goes on what the difference is between policing the world and actually using the military to go to war. %$* 10
and the two seem to be discussed along with each other. %$* 10
and i think they’re very different issues. %$* 10
so i don’t know if anyone wants to take it. %$* 10
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- who, who is that question directed to? %$* 494
which side? %$* 494
i’ll take it for the motion. %$* 10
you’ve answered it. %$* 496
you’ve already answered the question. %$* 496
why don’t you answer it again? %$* 496
yeah, i mean, just to get back to this point is that, i think that i can speak for people on this side and just say that again, that the policing issue, it doesn’t – first of all, it does not have to be prime %$* 333
only military. %$* 333
and i think that’s my, that’s fairly obvious. %$* 333
and even a member of the other side conceded, america’s role in operations like the post-tsunami operations a couple of years ago. %$* 333
and i think that, as i say, this should be cleared up before you vote – that the issue – and i think i mentioned it in my comments earlier, that the issue of, for instance, sustaining an operation, remaining in a country and all these sort of things, is not what we are talking about as policing. %$* 333
that policing operations are not welfare operations, as i mentioned earlier, but are also not imperialist operations. %$* 333
they’re not even operations which, people might think of sustaining for the long term. %$* 333
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- if i could just, could i just-- %$* 32
no, we will in a moment. %$* 494
we are going to wind this up. %$* 494
each of the debaters has two minutes and i will give you a one minute warning. %$* 494
and we will start with the team against the motion, ellen laipson, please. %$* 494
thanks, morley. %$* 495
i admire the optimism of the other side, that america’s power remains preeminent and will continue to be in – and they have been somewhat selective in their metrics or their use of factual information. %$* 495
i do think that we have some serious questions about the capacity to spread our military and civilian forces thinner around the world. %$* 495
one only needs to listen to military commanders’ concerns about recruitment, retention, the cost of medical care to our soldiers, et cetera, to realize that, you know, there are limits to our ability to serve this function. %$* 495
and i think there is both an ethical and a political argument of why not share it with others? %$* 495
i’ve heard the other side say, oh, we’re, we like allies. %$* 495
allies are fine. %$* 495
but they still believe that the essential decision making authority of deciding when to act – %$* 495
one minute. %$* 494
and where to act, is, resides in the united states. %$* 495
and i just rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- don’t think that’s the way the world works anymore. %$* 495
i really do believe that while the united states remains a country of exceptional wealth, talent, et cetera – and i deeply hope we remain so indefinitely-- %$* 495
we should be aware of a redistribution of talent, capacity in the international system. %$* 495
and we should embrace this and turn it into a virtue. %$* 495
we should not be afraid of it. %$* 495
we should not be threatened by it. %$* 495
and we should not think that that united states alone has a monopoly on wisdom about how to respond to the world’s trouble spots. %$* 495
and for me one of the strongest arguments of this discussion tonight has been legitimacy. %$* 495
michael conceded that we would have less legitimacy than the new york police, but that other countries so far haven’t pushed back. %$* 495
i think that’s not a permanent state of affairs and i think that we should be looking for, in – if we believe truly in democratic values, and i know we do – legitimacy should matter a lot. %$* 495
we should care more what other countries think and what their preferences are for finding the best solution to the world’s policemen. %$* 495
thank you. %$* 495
thanks, morley. %$* 495
i admire the optimism of the other side, that america’s power remains preeminent and will continue to be in – and they have been somewhat selective in their metrics or their use of factual information. %$* 495

allies are fine. %$* 495
but they still believe that the essential decision making authority of deciding when to act – %$* 495
max boot, you’re next. %$* 494
well, i’d like to begin by addressing the question that was just asked because i think it’s an important point. %$* 89
and by no means do those of us on this side advocate waging perpetual war. %$* 89
in rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- fact, what i believe is that if america takes seriously its global policing responsibilities that makes war less likely, not more likely. %$* 89
when you think simply about what an urban police force does, for example – cops on the beat walk the beat. %$* 89
they don’t fire their guns very often. %$* 89
and the more they’re out there, the more they have a presence the more they deter crime and the less, uh, likely it is that criminals will prey on innocent people. %$* 89
and they can have their greatest effect simply with the same kind of, uh, street corner presence that we expect here in new york city. %$* 89
and that’s essentially what the united states has been doing around the world for more than sixty years, where our navy keeps the straits of hormuz open. %$* 89
they patrol the world’s ocean to prevent pirates or other predators from disrupting the flow of global commerce. %$* 89
one minute. %$* 494
our troops are stationed in countries like japan and south korea and germany and elsewhere to prevent conflict, to deter conflict from occurring. %$* 89
and all you have to do to realize why this is a good thing is just to imagine the consequences of a world without american leadership. %$* 89
i mean, imagine arms races spiraling out of control in east asia and europe. %$* 89
imagine iran rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- closing the straits of hormuz. %$* 89
imagine chaos and civil war spilling over the borders of iraq and afghanistan into neighboring states. %$* 89
imagine terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. %$* 89
now, you may think i’m being melodramatic but, in fact, i think history shows the dire consequences of america abdicating its global policing role. %$* 89
and if even ten percent or a third of the things that i’m talking about are likely to happen if we give up this policing function, it’s an unacceptable risk. %$* 89
and we can afford the, the, uh, global policing function which we have performed. %$* 89
it is not bankrupting our country. %$* 89
it is a very small share of our public purse. %$* 89
well, i’d like to begin by addressing the question that was just asked because i think it’s an important point. %$* 89
and by no means do those of us on this side advocate waging perpetual war. %$* 89
in rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- fact, what i believe is that if america takes seriously its global policing responsibilities that makes war less likely, not more likely. %$* 89
when you think simply about what an urban police force does, for example – cops on the beat walk the beat. %$* 89

and that’s essentially what the united states has been doing around the world for more than sixty years, where our navy keeps the straits of hormuz open. %$* 89
they patrol the world’s ocean to prevent pirates or other predators from disrupting the flow of global commerce. %$* 89
you must wrap it up. %$* 494
we have to continue in order to prevent the very wars that all of us decry. %$* 89
matthew parris. %$* 494
well, i’m becoming more and more confused listening to max boot as to whether the united states can or can’t afford this role. %$* 497
in one breath he says they can and then challenged over africa, he says they can’t. %$* 497
that quote from tony blair that douglas murray gave us was thoroughly disingenuous. %$* 497
i don’t because i rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- can’t. %$* 497
britain is perfectly capable of toppling mugabe’s regime in zimbabwe. %$* 497
the united states is perfectly capable of instigating free and fair elections in kenya. %$* 497
britain and the united states together could do something about darfur. %$* 497
they don’t and the reason that they don’t, i believe, is that there is no coherent view on the part of the allies as to what the role of world’s policeman would be or where the world’s policeman would police. %$* 497
and i believe that one of the reasons there’s no coherent view is american democracy. %$* 497
i don’t think the american people are really into this kind of thing. %$* 497
i don’t think the american people really want this role. %$* 497
if they did there would have been much more discussion as to how it should be imposed. %$* 497
secondly, multilateralism. %$* 497
one minute. %$* 494
are they in favor of it or are they against it on the other side? %$* 497
max boot seemed to speak very disparagingly about multilateralism. %$* 497
mr. %$* 497
mandelbaum spoke about the feebleness of the united nations. %$* 497
one of the reasons for the feebleness of the united nations is that countries like america, and to some extent britain, have not entirely supported the united nations. %$* 497
there’s lots of things wrong with the united nations. %$* 497
but one of them is there is no feeling that the united states any longer really wants rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- to make the united nations a driving multilateral force. %$* 497
douglas, murray spoke about police not policing, not really meaning the assertion of force. %$* 497
he seemed to call up a vision of an american world policeman as a kind of world marriage guidance counselor or world social worker or world priest or, uh-- %$* 497
well, i’m becoming more and more confused listening to max boot as to whether the united states can or can’t afford this role. %$* 497
in one breath he says they can and then challenged over africa, he says they can’t. %$* 497
that quote from tony blair that douglas murray gave us was thoroughly disingenuous. %$* 497
i don’t because i rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- can’t. %$* 497
britain is perfectly capable of toppling mugabe’s regime in zimbabwe. %$* 497
the united states is perfectly capable of instigating free and fair elections in kenya. %$* 497
britain and the united states together could do something about darfur. %$* 497
they don’t and the reason that they don’t, i believe, is that there is no coherent view on the part of the allies as to what the role of world’s policeman would be or where the world’s policeman would police. %$* 497
and i believe that one of the reasons there’s no coherent view is american democracy. %$* 497
i don’t think the american people are really into this kind of thing. %$* 497
i don’t think the american people really want this role. %$* 497
if they did there would have been much more discussion as to how it should be imposed. %$* 497
secondly, multilateralism. %$* 497
i must ask, i must ask you to wrap it up. %$* 494
or rabbi. %$* 497
i will wrap up. %$* 497
america has two great weapons. %$* 497
one is force and the other is persuasion, the power of moral persuasion. %$* 497
they are not complementary. %$* 497
the more force is used the more the power of moral persuasion will be undermined. %$* 497
and i would urge you to oppose the motion and to support the idea of moral persuasion and not the use of force. %$* 497
michael mandelbaum. %$* 494
some people in new york – possibly including some people in this room – are unhappy. %$* 496
the new york police department can’t help you. %$* 496
morley safer noted that despite the presence of nato forces – and incidentally, if you want to see just what america’s allies are willing to do in a cause with which they agree, check out their performance in afghanistan. %$* 496
it’s pretty pathetic. %$* 496
despite, morley safer has rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- noted that drugs are still traded. %$* 496
they’re still traded in new york, within a few blocks of here. %$* 496
that’s not an argument against new york having a police force. %$* 496
and what is true of new york is true of the world as well. %$* 496
the fact that the united states cannot bring chechnya to a successful resolution is not an argument against the united states acting as the world’s police force. %$* 496
the job of a police force in the world, as in new york, is not to make things perfect. %$* 496
it’s to keep things from becoming worse. %$* 496
and that the united states does in the world in two important ways – by its military deployments and alliances that undergird globalization and by leading the effort against nuclear proliferation and deterring rogue states if and when they get nuclear weapons. %$* 496
those are important global tasks. %$* 496
they are the tasks of global policing. %$* 496
other countries and other organizations have shown no inclination to do them. %$* 496
therefore it is in everybody’s interest that the united states continue to do so. %$* 496
that is why you should support this motion. %$* 496
ian bremmer. %$* 494
you’ve brought up a number of times the notion that nobody else wants to be the global policeman so the united states has to step up for the job. %$* 105
i agree. %$* 105
nobody else wants to be the world’s rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- policeman. %$* 105
lots of people want to be their own region’s and their own neighborhood’s policeman. %$* 105
some of them, thankfully, are incapable, like venezuela. %$* 105
some of them are increasingly capable, like china in asia and like russia in eurasia. %$* 105
and the united states has to recognize that. %$* 105
they have to recognize that the extraordinary shift in importance of alliances and the importance in the battles of the hearts and minds, not of the individual people in these countries, but of the leaders that have to support this policing role to provide legitimacy is not only assured by the world’s largest military but also by the world’s largest trade flows. %$* 105
but – %$* 105
one %$* 494
but also by the influence in these countries. %$* 105
and we’re seeing that in terms of china’s extraordinary influence in latin america, which is growing by the second, in africa, by russia and eurasia and the rest. %$* 105
the united states is going to have to learn to live with this. %$* 105
look, it’s true that a lot of americans aren’t happy. %$* 105
they’re unhappy because of subprime. %$* 105
they’re unhappy because of recession. %$* 105
they’re unhappy because of energy and security. %$* 105
they’re unhappy because of iraq. %$* 105
and increasingly they’re unhappy because the bailout that’s coming isn’t like the u.s.government with the s&l crisis. %$* 105
the bailout rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- that’s happening with the big blue chips right now is coming from china and the gulf and the rest. %$* 105
we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water. %$* 105
we don’t want americans that are increasingly insecure to say the u.s.shouldn’t play a leadership role. %$* 105
look, every debate needs a theme. %$* 105
for me this theme is that the great should never be the enemy of the good. %$* 105
okay, now i’m an american and i’d love to have the great. %$* 105
but i tell you, i’d take what i can get. %$* 105
you’ve brought up a number of times the notion that nobody else wants to be the global policeman so the united states has to step up for the job. %$* 105
i agree. %$* 105
nobody else wants to be the world’s rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- policeman. %$* 105
lots of people want to be their own region’s and their own neighborhood’s policeman. %$* 105
some of them, thankfully, are incapable, like venezuela. %$* 105
some of them are increasingly capable, like china in asia and like russia in eurasia. %$* 105
and the united states has to recognize that. %$* 105
they have to recognize that the extraordinary shift in importance of alliances and the importance in the battles of the hearts and minds, not of the individual people in these countries, but of the leaders that have to support this policing role to provide legitimacy is not only assured by the world’s largest military but also by the world’s largest trade flows. %$* 105
but – %$* 105
douglas murray. %$* 494
thank you. %$* 333
i’d like to start off by mentioning something ellen laipson said that she said some time earlier, that the rest of the world is providing the actual police. %$* 333
and one of the reasons why that may be the case is because you as a nation are the ones that are doing the heavy lifting. %$* 333
it’s not hard for canada or somebody to not be able to provide troops, but to be able to provide policemen. %$* 333
it’s not hard for germany to send legions of people to afghanistan who won’t fire a gun. %$* 333
you can find those people. %$* 333
who are you going to call? %$* 333
this is the question that we should have in our minds. %$* 333
when something goes wrong, when a tsunami occurs, when a massive humanitarian catastrophe like that, when a rogue state emerges, when a failed state becomes an rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- even more failed state or a successful one starts to fail who are you going to call? %$* 333
is it going to be another nation state? %$* 333
or is it going to be the u.n.? %$* 333
matthew parris mentioned the u.n.the idea of the u.n.policing the world is like saying that you just pick a cross section of every household in new york and say that that house will do the policing and that one and that one. %$* 333
in other words, an entirely random process which will mean you’ll get a certain amount of people who are fine but you won’t get the driven people. %$* 333
you won’t get the people who are prepared to do the job, who are trained to do the job, who are financed to do the job. %$* 333
you’ll get some people who can do it accidentally. %$* 333
you’ll also get some bums and some lazy guys and some guys who are just wicked and others. %$* 333
and that’s what the u.n. is composed of, is a whole group of people who you would give more legitimacy for the simple fact that they’re there? %$* 333
and you know, this comes back to this issue i raised earlier about america wanting to be liked. %$* 333
you can police the world, you can be the world’s policeman. %$* 333
you should not be, it looks extremely bad to look like you’re desperately wanting to be loved by the rest of the world as well. %$* 333
you will be blamed when you’re the world’s most powerful nation. %$* 333
you will be blamed when you intervene and you will be blamed when you don’t. %$* 333
you will just have to put up with that. %$* 333
and rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- when the other side says that the great should not be the enemy of the good, i don’t think anyone on this side would be or has implied that it would be. %$* 333
but the great should certainly be the enemy of the bad. %$* 333
wrap it up. %$* 494
well done. %$* 494
it’s now time for you to decide who carried the day or the night here. %$* 494
once again, please pick up your keypads and after my prompt, i want you to press one if you’re for the motion, america should be the world’s policeman; two if you’re against the motion or three if you are undecided. %$* 494
and please cast your votes now. %$* 494
i want to thank the debaters, both sides. %$* 494
i thought they were really extraordinarily on their toes tonight. %$* 494
and the audience for, first of all, for coming out in this weather and secondly, for your really excellent, excellent questions. %$* 494
and i also want to thank you for not heckling the side you didn’t like. %$* 494
before i announce the results of the audience vote i want to take care of a couple of things. %$* 494
the next intelligence squared u.s.debate will be on tuesday, march 11th here at asia society museum. %$* 494
the motion to be debated – this is a good one, too, the motion to be debated is: tough interrogation of terror suspects is necessary. %$* 494

and now the debate results: after our debaters did their best to sway you, you voted - - twenty-four percent for. %$* 494
sorry. %$* 494
i’m sorry, i gave you the early results. %$* 494
after the debate, forty-seven percent for, forty-eight percent against. %$* 494
and five percent rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- undecided. %$* 494
it’s fascinating. %$* 494
wow, wow, wow. %$* 498
i, it, it – i mean, if this was one of those dreadful election night results, things that wolf blitzer does, it would say, too close to call. %$* 494
does this mean that the super delegates decide? %$* 499
yes, i’m the super delegate and i decide against won by a whisker. %$* 494
but you both did remark %$* 494
you, both sides did really remarkably well. %$* 494
and i thought it was one of the most articulate cases from the six of you that i’ve heard either for or against. %$* 494
and i thank you both very-- %$* 494
all very much. %$* 494
thank you. %$* 499
that’s remarkable. %$* 494
that is remarkable. %$* 499

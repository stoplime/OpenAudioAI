it's like a shocking phenomenon, 40 percent of american children are now born to single parent households. %$* 518
you could say that's because the women have decided that the men are finished, they don't need them, they don't contribute to the household, the women are the ones doing all the work and going to school and the men are just sort of another child in the house to feed and that's what all the women tell me. %$* 518
i wish that it was funny but it's not funny. %$* 518
that's the part of this that's the tragedy about men are finished. %$* 518
one last question, sir. %$* 13
well, my background is in the apparel industry. %$* 18
i was the largest employer in the state of tennessee, and the largest employer in the state of maryland, and the largest employer in alabama, all women sewing apparel. %$* 18
and we had to train women managers, and we made a major effort to do that. %$* 18
so what's your question then? %$* 13
my education is business school where there was one woman in a class of 800 when i went-- %$* 18
right, but i'd like you to get to a question, sir. %$* 13
what we need to do is be sure that women are taught how to manage large groups of people and then they will get the important jobs, not just do the work, and we haven't done that, now how can we make more women managers, not just family managers, but managers of businesses, service businesses, and manufacturing businesses, most of which in my industry worked overseas? %$* 18
okay, i'm not sure that, that's getting to our question of what do we do for the men, which i think is a little bit more on point. %$* 13
there are women managers-- %$* 518
there-- %$* 518
54 percent of american managers are now women, they don't need that much help on that. %$* 518
i'm going to take one more question, right down in front with %$* 13
i just have a quick question. %$* 19
does anybody have the statistics on how many men become women and how many women become men? %$* 19
it's-- %$* 13
that's a whole ‘nother debate which we're going to have shortly. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
folks, really, really, i think it has been so clear and all instances about how to do this. %$* 13
sir, can you stand up? %$* 13
that's one of the parts-- %$* 13
my question is, can you imagine being a cofounder or founder of an island where only women live on this island? %$* 18
okay, i'm going to go to another-- %$* 13
yes, i can, but-- %$* 13
i have an answer. %$* 19
i sometimes do, but-- %$* 13
right down front. %$* 13
someone did ask the question, what would it be like if women ran the world and the reply was there would be no more war, just lots of jealous countries refusing to speak to one another. %$* 519
okay, can you rise? %$* 13
and make this a-- %$* 13
give us a finish here. %$* 13
because you might be our last question. %$* 13
although it's true that women have been earning more bachelor's degrees, how significant of a point is that when women are still doing two thirds of the work in the world and earning 10 percent of the income and owning less than one percent of the property? %$* 19
and that's directed towards hanna and dan. %$* 19
okay, again, it's not on our topic about men. %$* 13
somebody, hear me, hear me. %$* 13
you got it? %$* 13
men are not finished. %$* 18
you got it? %$* 13
hello? %$* 18
front row, sorry, please, don't make me regret choosing you. %$* 13
i'm a do you proud, i'm a do you proud. %$* 18
my question is for christina. %$* 18
you were speaking earlier about how in elementary school it's designed against boys. %$* 18
sometimes, yes, very often. %$* 519
well, you were emphasizing how dire it was that we have to change that and we have to help boys. %$* 18
right. %$* 519
in doing so, are you conceding that if something doesn't change, then men are finished? %$* 18
yes. %$* 518
christina, take that question. %$* 13
first of all, men-- %$* 519
that's ridiculous, men are not finished. %$* 519
and that’s why you should vote against the proposition. %$* 519
no, but-- %$* 519
no, what i’m saying is we have set up an obstacle course for young men that makes it-- %$* 519
and we’re doing a much better job educating young women, supporting young women, encouraging young women. %$* 519
there is-- %$* 519
every scintilla of evidence suggests it. %$* 519
so what we have to do is find a way and, yes, it goes back to the elementary school classroom where we have to support boys. %$* 519
now am i saying that means men are finished? %$* 519
no, i don’t see how you hear that. %$* 519
i’m saying we’ve set up handicaps. %$* 519
we’ve set up obstacles. %$* 519
yes, and unless we change and get rid of those handicaps, men are finished. %$* 18
no, false. %$* 519
wrong, illogical. %$* 519
i’ll give you one statistic, patents. %$* 519
i’ve got to get my brother to sit down. %$* 520
ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minute each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
right after these closing statements, we’re going to ask you once again to vote. %$* 13
and the team that has changed your minds-- %$* 13
most of your minds in the course of this debate-- %$* 13
i’m going to say that again. %$* 13
and the team that has most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, onto round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is this, "men are finished." and here to summarize his position again, her position-- %$* 13
and here to summarize her position against the motion, christina hoff sommers, resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and author of “the war against boys.” %$* 13
i urge you to vote against this proposition for three reasons. %$* 519
number one, it’s false. %$* 519
okay, women are not replacing men. %$* 519
women are not becoming the first sex. %$* 519
women are becoming partners with men. %$* 519
men continue to do most of the arduous and dangerous work, and they are the primary risk-takers and innovators. %$* 519
society is driven by what the classical economist joseph schumpeter called “the gale of creative destruction.” women can cause such gales, but it has always been a masculine specialty, and there is zero evidence that that is changing. %$* 519
now as i said in my earlier remarks, men have been doing less well in the classroom, but this does not herald the end of men. %$* 519
rather, it means that we have to find ways of making our schools more effective for male students. %$* 519
reason two you should oppose this proposition: it’s chauvinistic. %$* 519
as i said, in the old days, we had female supremacy. %$* 519
it’s been replaced by this variety of “women are wonderful” phenomenon. %$* 519
the battle days of male supremacy are now followed by this female chauvinism. %$* 519
so, i believe that an act in favor of this proposition is a vote for chauvinism. %$* 519
third and most important, the sexes need each other. %$* 519
they complement each other. %$* 519
they have been known to love one another. %$* 519
as henry kissinger once said, “no one will ever win the war between the sexes. %$* 519
there’s just too much fraternizing with the enemy.” now women and men do not succeed at one another’s expense. %$* 519
we’re on the same team. %$* 519
we’re co-dependent. %$* 519
that was true on the african savanna 100,000 years ago. %$* 519
it has been true ever since. %$* 519
it’s true in 21st century america. %$* 519
you can certainly find times when one sex has acquitted itself better than the other, but you will never find examples of one sex becoming irrelevant. %$* 519
such a development is beyond anything in human experience. %$* 519
i urge you to vote in favor of reality. %$* 519
thank you. %$* 519
thank you, christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
our motion is "men are finished," and here to summarize her position in support of this motion, hanna rosin, an award-winning journalist for slate and the atlantic. %$* 13
i’m going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes. %$* 518
one is from a story called, “the decline of the american male.” “men,” this writer says, “are endangered species. %$* 518
they are expendable.” another quote: “women have gained in the past century while men have fallen behind.” who is this mystery author? %$* 518
dave zinczenko is the mystery author who wrote this story at usa today in 2009.he keeps saying this is preposterous, this is preposterous. %$* 518
merely two years ago, he thought that it was true. %$* 518
now i’m going to read you another series of quotes. %$* 518
“it is boys who are the second sex. %$* 518
it’s a bad time to be a boy in america. %$* 518
the research”-- %$* 518
listen to this closely-- %$* 518
“commonly cited to support claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors.”who is the mystery author of this article? %$* 518
christina hoff sommers, who’s also saying that this is all very preposterous. %$* 518
so, as you can see, it’s not that preposterous. %$* 518
we can all see the writing on the walls. %$* 518
they keep talking about how men are still running the country. %$* 518
men are still doing this, men are still doing that. %$* 518
but that's not interesting. %$* 518
that just shows a lack of imagination. %$* 518
as we said, this "men are finished" proposition, you literally have to think of it as graffiti, as the writing on the wall pointing to an inevitable future. %$* 518
all the signs are there. %$* 518
so-- %$* 518
and then the final thing i want to say is, christina says this is a vote for chauvinism, that "men are finished" is a vote for chauvinism. %$* 518
don't think of it that way. %$* 518
you're actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because i think if we finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need our help, and they might even need some affirmative action, then maybe we would behave the right way, and we would help the men who desperately need our help. %$* 518
so remember, vote for men are finished." %$* 518
thank you, hanna rosin. %$* 13
our motion is "men are finished." and here to summarize his position against the motion, david zinczenko, executive vice president and editor in chief of men's health magazine. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 521
thank you, john. %$* 521
thank you. %$* 521
hats off to dan and hanna. %$* 521
that article, by the way, was arguing for better healthcare for men. %$* 521
there are five offices of women's health in the federal government, zero for men. %$* 521
that was really the context. %$* 521
now, my opponents tonight have outlined some trends that seem to herald the final decent of the american male into a metaphorical trash heap of irrelevance and impotence. %$* 521
they are trying to bury legions of men alive, okay? %$* 521
you have to vote against this measure. %$* 521
sure, there are some worrisome trends. %$* 521
they went through them, okay? %$* 521
and as we all know once a trend starts, it keeps going on forever. %$* 521
that's why all of our houses are worth so much more today than they were in 2007.now, in the end, there are two reasons why you must vote against this motion, because they might be wrong, but they might be right. %$* 521
now, the first point, consider this: gender equality is something, we can all agree on, as an ideal. %$* 521
but if we are approaching gender equality, why are there fewer women in government today than there were ten years ago? %$* 521
why is it so much easier for men to hold onto their gun rights than it is for women to hold onto their reproductive rights? %$* 521
not only aren't men finished, but women haven't even begun. %$* 521
let's at least get to the point where the game is tied before we start writing all the men off. %$* 521
let's imagine, though, that the trend toward greater female political social and economic power continues unabated. %$* 521
highly unlikely because the great recession started with men and now it's starting to hit predominantly female jobs more than before. %$* 521
and the scales are tilting. %$* 521
so the more educated independent single women there are the more wonderful the world will actually get for men, okay? %$* 521
so regardless of whether we one day achieve gender equality, men are not finished. %$* 521
and by the way, women are not either. %$* 521
you have to vote against this measure. %$* 521
thank you, david zinczenko. %$* 13
our motion is "men are finished." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, dan abrams, chief legal analyst for abc news, author of "man down." %$* 13
it seemed at times that our opponents were pleading to you as a moral matter to vote against this. %$* 520
it would be wrong, be horrible. %$* 520
look what would happen? %$* 520
you would make the guys feel bad. %$* 520
look, the reality is that we're not just talking about women catching up. %$* 520
we're talking about women surpassing men. %$* 520
both hanna and i have talked to you in depth and at length about how significantly women have not caught up but surpassed men in very significant areas in our society. %$* 520
david mentioned before that you're not going to see jock strap protests outside. %$* 520
that's right. %$* 520
that's part of the problem is that men are not alarmed by the situation. %$* 520
and that's one of the main reasons that men are finished, is they don't seem to care. %$* 520
they think-- %$* 520
they think it's cool to be a slacker. %$* 520
it's not. %$* 520
dave mentioned the chilean mines and the miners there as an effort to sort of pull at your heartstrings. %$* 520
there's no question that that was a heartfelt moment. %$* 520
but what if a woman had designed that mine? %$* 520
i'm guessing that we might not have ever had that sort of problem. %$* 520
i will end with one note from my book which is that there was a study done on how long it takes men and women to get ready to leave the house. %$* 520
and this study, in england, of 2,000 people showed that men take, on average, four minutes longer. %$* 520
when you think about a saturday night, no question women will take longer to get ready to leave the house. %$* 520
but when you think about the realities that women face every day of bringing up children, of working a job very often, of doing all the hard work and trying to get ready to leave the house, it starts to make sense. %$* 520
and if that study's true, then men really are finished. %$* 520
thank you, dan abrams. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
remember, we've asked you to vote before the debate began. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to vote "against" now judging the qualities of these arguments. %$* 13
you go to the keypad at your seat. %$* 13
our motion is this: "men are finished." if you agree with the motion or feel that the argument was presented best on that side, you push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, you push number two. %$* 13
if you remain or became undecided, you push number three. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
seriously? %$* 13
one, if you're for the motion. %$* 13
two if you're against. %$* 13
they're number one. %$* 13
we’re number 1, they’re number 2. %$* 518
that's a very good way to put it. %$* 13
we've never done that. %$* 13
and a woman came up with that idea. %$* 13
number one, number two, undecided is number three. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we're going to have the results very, very quickly. %$* 13
i want to just talk a little bit about a couple of things that are coming up. %$* 13
but first i want to thank the debaters for the quality of the arguments that they brought here. %$* 13
for the unique and difficult to achieve combination of being serious and intelligent while also a lot of fun at the same time. %$* 13
this is also normally the point in the evening in which i thank the audience for its great questions. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
i want to say that it really pleased me to see those neurons firing rapidly, and in some cases randomly. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but all of you for having the guts to get up and face this and face what i was doing. %$* 13
in any case, i really appreciate it. %$* 13
and as an audience, you actually have been spectacular, wonderful and very vocal. %$* 13
so thank you very much for this evening. %$* 13
we'd like to thank slate for being our media partner for live streaming this debate and for bringing questions to us and for being part of this in the future as well. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
we're back here again on tuesday, october 4th. %$* 13
our next debate has this motion: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future."arguing in support of this motion, we'll have margaret hoover. %$* 13
she is author of "american individualism." it's a political manifesto that evokes her great-grandfather, herbert hoover's, emphasis on the values of civic responsibility. %$* 13
joining her as her teammate is mort zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of u.s. news and world report who wondered, in a recent op ed, how, quote, "a country of pioneers and self- made men could evolve into a culture of entitlement." arguing against this motion, we're going to have howard dean, former chairman of the democratic national committee, six-term governor of vermont, a physician and one-time candidate for president in 2004. and his partner will be jeff madrick editor of challenge magazine and author of "the case for big government." and that argues-- %$* 13
that says that engaged government, a big government of high taxes and wise regulations is necessary to ensure america's social and economic security. %$* 13
you can find a full listing of all of our fall debates in tonight's program and also on our website where tickets are available for purchase. %$* 13
all of our debates, as we've said already, can be heard on npr stations across the country, including wnyc here in new york and also watched on wnet's 13, wliw and njtv.and don't forget to follow intelligence squared u.s.on twitter and make sure to become a fan of facebook. %$* 13
and if you do, you will get a discount on future debates. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to announce the results. %$* 13
and i want to do it this way. %$* 13
so these debaters have spent the last hour plus trying to win you over to their point of view on our motion, "men are finished." we had you vote once before the debate and once again at the end of the debate. %$* 13
both of those votes are now in. %$* 13
and here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate, with the motion being, "men are finished," 20 percent were for the motion, 54 percent were against, and 26 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 66 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that's up 46 percent. %$* 13
29 percent are against. %$* 13
that is down 25 percent. %$* 13
5 percent undecided. %$* 13
that's down 21 percent. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion, "men are finished," has carried our debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s., we'll see you next time. %$* 13

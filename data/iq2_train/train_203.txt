but i was just going to say that joe recognized fred krupp as somebody who he thought was reasonable and authoritative. %$* 537
and the environmental defense fund has recently done a study, looking at the climate impacts of shifting from coal to gas, and i will tell you that they do find, they do agree that we would do better, assuming that our methane emissions don't rise to the level of four percent, but they absolutely disagree that if we shift our entire transportation system from oil to gas, that we are going to have net climate benefits over as much as 100 years. %$* 537
so i think we can agree that there might be a small part. %$* 537
there's natural gas buses in new york city. %$* 537
there might be small amounts, but shifting the whole sector over is just a non-starter. %$* 537
joe nocera. %$* 13
let me say two quick things about that. %$* 539
first of all, what edf has actually said is that if methane leakage can come down and, the idea that we can't have any technology to make things better seems to me pretty unreasonable. %$* 539
technology does make things better, and the idea that we're always going to be stuck even if in fact, if we are today, at four percent methane leakage, is not necessarily the way it's going to play out. %$* 539
secondly, it's already happening. %$* 539
not only are buses fueled by natural gas in cities, but large trucking companies are beginning to convert to natural gas, and large energy companies are beginning to think about putting natural gas stations on the interstate highway. %$* 539
all right, question down in the front row. %$* 13
sir, could you stand and tell us your name and if you're affiliated with the-- %$* 13
arnie togan i've written a lot of legislation, and i've helped with a lot of legislation and i just want to congratulate you on the scare tactics that you used, because believe it or not it helps us write our legislation. %$* 18
an example of it-- %$* 18
sir, can you-- %$* 13
can you just bring it to a question for them? %$* 13
okay, i just wonder if stopping this process is the answer. %$* 18
that's not what we have advocated. %$* 537
so i would say, "no," once again. %$* 537
another question. %$* 13
i'm sorry that i'm tending towards the right there, did you have your hand up? %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
yes, she did. %$* 13
okay, yeah. %$* 13
i mean, all right, i'll come back to you. %$* 13
go ahead, sir. %$* 13
my name's kevin alt and an engineer in the oil business. %$* 18
i have fracked wells in pennsylvania, fracked wells texas, oklahoma, new mexico. %$* 18
you give the impression that the science has to catch up. %$* 18
do you have any idea how long we've been fracking wells? %$* 18
we have been fracking wells not for shale gas for many decades, but the shale gas fracturing, which includes two technologies used together, the horizontal drilling and the hydraulic fracturing, has been used, seriously, only for about a decade, and it's the impacts of the shale gas drilling that are driving all that opposition, because we are not prepared for the volume of the wastewater, and we have nobody out there in the federal government and in many states that are looking cumulatively at all of the impacts. %$* 537
so it's about wastewater? %$* 18
it is wastewater. %$* 537
but i'm sorry, i don't understand the question. %$* 537
i-- %$* 13
you actually did ask the question, but i can't have you debate. %$* 13
but do you want to ask a follow-up question? %$* 13
yeah, you-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
you said first that it's about methane leakage. %$* 18
wastewater is handled efficiently coming out of all the wells. %$* 18
and again, pennsylvania will adapt very quickly to this. %$* 18
so i-- %$* 18
this is not a wastewater question, and it's not a wastewater management question. %$* 18
where is the wastewater going that's coming out of the well? %$* 538
into water disposal wells. %$* 18
in ohio. %$* 537
in pennsylvania as well. %$* 18
there's one commercial well that takes shale gas wastewater in all of pennsylvania and - - %$* 537
but there’s lots of private wells. %$* 18
they-- %$* 537
they're not taking this-- %$* 537
sir, i'm going to end this because-- %$* 13
not because i don't think it's a legitimate point but i just don't want you to be the debater. %$* 13
that's their job here-- %$* 13
because it's so much fun when you are. %$* 540
good evening, i'm kathy lemieux- rodman. %$* 19
i thank you all for being here. %$* 19
it's been a wonderful presentation. %$* 19
joe, this is for you and sue. %$* 19
i was on the board at edf for many years and watched legislation for coal and for many years how the lawyers handled scrubbers and a lot of other work. %$* 19
it was wonderful. %$* 19
joe, you bring up the question of national security. %$* 19
if you look backwards at where we've come with environment extraction, anything taking anything out of the earth has plus and minus, but there's short term and long term gain. %$* 19
my question to you is, as a journalist, would you address the issue of water as national security over the next 100 years, because as we pollute our water, we don't have water to drink, that's going to be an issue, and, sue, with all you're doing, all your analysis-- %$* 19
okay, but water is going to be one of the central issues of the century that we live in. %$* 539
there's no question about that, and there's also no question that we have to work hard to avoid polluting our water, and that's why i advocate that there are areas that we shouldn't frack, and i also think-- %$* 539
this is why i also-- %$* 539
on this side of the table, we're not saying, “frack horribly.” we're not saying, “hey, let's put the worst wells in we can and let them leak and damage the environment.” what we're saying is if you do it responsibly, if you do it in a regulated way, you minimize the possibility. %$* 539
you don't eliminate it. %$* 539
you don't eliminate all risk. %$* 539
okay. %$* 13
right down in the front there. %$* 13
i thought i understood the question that we were going to vote on before i came in here. %$* 18
but as this is continued, it seems to me we're talking about matters of degrees. %$* 18
so, when we do cast our votes, are we voting for no fracking, with this red sign that says “none”? %$* 18
or are we voting for some degree of fracking that's controlled-- %$* 18
but it sounds to me like you're both saying the same thing, with different, different degrees of %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
first of all-- %$* 13
first of all-- %$* 13
to clearly clarify, we're not saying “no fracking at all.” we're-- %$* 13
the motion says that the cost-benefit analysis-- %$* 13
it's a judgment on the cost-benefit analysis as opposed to immediately making a policy decision. %$* 13
that said, where is the-- %$* 13
where is the disagreement between these two sides? %$* 13
well, i was worried about that actually, when we were going into this, because it seems to me that we're probably much closer than the organizers of this event might have thought. %$* 537
so, we're trying to make for a lively debate-- %$* 537
i don't-- %$* 539
i don't agree. %$* 539
i think-- %$* 539
i-- %$* 539
i think that-- %$* 539
he doesn't agree with you already. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
joe. %$* 13
the people on this side believe that the issues of the economic benefits, the security benefits, and even the environmental benefits make fracking-- %$* 539
the benefits far outweigh the costs. %$* 539
and that is our view. %$* 539
and i don't think you’ve said anything that really has changed our minds on that. %$* 539
the issue we're-- %$* 539
do we care about having it done right? %$* 539
yes, we do. %$* 539
do we think the benefits are tremendous for america? %$* 539
yes, we do. %$* 539
and-- %$* 539
we think the benefits would still be there-- %$* 540
sue tierney. %$* 13
if we added 50 cents to the price of natural gas to cover these things? %$* 540
yes. %$* 540
the benefits are huge. %$* 540
but i would say-- %$* 538
kate hudson. %$* 13
that the question here is not whether we can do it right at some point in the future, but whether we're doing it right now. %$* 538
right now-- %$* 538
all right. %$* 13
i have to say, that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and now we go on to round 3.and round 3 is where each of the debaters has a last chance to persuade you to their point of view or to persuade you that they've actually presented the better argument. %$* 13
our motion is this: no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
each debater gets two minutes to summarize his or her position. %$* 13
and speaking first, against this motion, joe nocera, an op-ed columnist for “the new york times.” you can applaud. %$* 13
let me do that again. %$* 13
you don't have to. %$* 539
i'll do that again. %$* 13
and speaking against the motion, joe nocera, an op-ed columnist for “the new york times.” %$* 13
on some level, i gave my closing argument about two seconds ago. %$* 539
i do feel that it's clear that natural gas has reduced emissions. %$* 539
it is demonstrably better than coal. %$* 539
it is offering us the possibility-- %$* 539
wonderful possibility-- %$* 539
to wean ourselves from mideast oil. %$* 539
and it's been incredibly economically beneficial for the country to have gas plentiful and cheap. %$* 539
i want to say-- %$* 539
i really want to end on, on this spot. %$* 539
our opponents-- %$* 539
i want to think about it this way. %$* 539
when you're arguing against fracking, you're not arguing for a future of renewables. %$* 539
you may think you are, but you're not. %$* 539
you're arguing for the status quo. %$* 539
you're arguing for a world where coal is still the dominant power generation, where oil is still the fundamental fuel that we use to transport ourselves. %$* 539
you know, all the problems that we have today that have been brought about by the way we use energy are still with us. %$* 539
and so, what i would ask the other side to think about is, what does the future look like if we don't have fracking? %$* 539
what does the future look like if we don't have this wonderful source of natural gas, this abundant source of gas that we've been given. %$* 539
i don't think the future looks all that well-- %$* 539
all that good. %$* 539
thank you very much. %$* 539
you don't have to. %$* 539
thank you, joe nocera. %$* 13
our motion is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good and here to summarize their position in support of this motion, kate hudson, watershed program director for riverkeeper. %$* 13
having heard what our opponents have said here tonight, you might think we should not be concerned about the impacts of fracking. %$* 538
in their view, any problems we have now will be fixed with golden rules, more regulation, and hopes of improved technology. %$* 538
i think of a few reasons to remain concerned. %$* 538
one, there will always be accidents, spills, mechanical failures, and human error. %$* 538
two, the gas industry has consistently fought enforceable rules and there is insufficient state and federal staff to ensure compliance with what rules do exist. %$* 538
three, the idea that the industry as a whole will comply with voluntary best practices-- %$* 538
as i think our opponents have acknowledged-- %$* 538
in the face of falling gas prices, is unlikely. %$* 538
given the continued risk of harm and all of frackings costs weighed against its limited benefits for most, it is beyond dispute that the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 538
simply ask the mothers of children who attend the red hawk elementary school in the front range town of eerie, colorado. %$* 538
last fall there were children who stayed home from school with intestinal and breathing problems due to the hundreds of oil drill rigs-- %$* 538
gas drill rigs in the region. %$* 538
then, the industry insisted on locating gas wells a few hundred yards from the school and a short distance from a school playing field. %$* 538
parents and children joined together to protest the new well and the town put a temporary moratorium on new permits, but that does not apply to the already permitted elementary school site. %$* 538
so this summer, as drilling takes place, teenage boys will have football practice in the shadow of operating drill rigs. %$* 538
the families of eerie make it clear, if this uncontrolled experiment, which is the natural gas boom, is allowed to continue, homeowners, farms, schools, and hospitals whose neighbors agree to lease will have no choice. %$* 538
but we have a choice now. %$* 538
the shale gas boom is doing more harm than good and we urge you all to say-- %$* 538
to vote no fracking way. %$* 538
thank you, kate hudson. %$* 13
and that is our motion, no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good, and here to summarize her position against the motion, sue tierney, former assistant secretary for policy at the u.s. department of energy. %$* 13
i was-- %$* 540
i was also secretary of environmental affairs in massachusetts, head of the environmental police, head of environmental regulation. %$* 540
i came into this field because i grew up in southern california and couldn't stand the fact that we couldn't see the mountains from where i lived. %$* 540
i went into energy because it seemed to me it was an unbelievably complicated world in which you had these environmental impacts, which were so compelling, and yet you had everybody using cars and a variety of things. %$* 540
in the 30 years that i've been in the energy and environmental fields, i have never seen more polarizing and demonizing discussions as now exist on shale gas, and i saw nuclear plant debates, i saw transmission line plants, everything. %$* 540
this is one where the science and the information is-- %$* 540
the gap between what we know and what people say we know is wider than i've seen in any other field. %$* 540
the reason i bring this up is this polarizing part of it makes it impossible for the two sides to find the middle ground, and that's why this issue is we need to stop demonizing this particular fuel, because if we do that we kill it and we kill not only the benefits that joe just described, but we get back to coal. %$* 540
and that is the reality that we face and i urge you, for that reason, to vote against this proposition. %$* 540
thank you, sue tierney. %$* 13
motion is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good, and here to summarize her position in support of the motion, no fracking way, deborah goldberg, the managing attorney at earthjustice. %$* 13
i'd like to close with two of my favorite quotes from my opponents. %$* 537
in february of this year, joe nocera wrote, "how much methane leaks into the air as a result of fracking? %$* 537
" incredibly, nobody knows. %$* 537
in may of this year, sue tierney said on npr, "fifty years from now, are we really going to be wondering if we really screwed up because we went on this big gas boom? %$* 537
you really wouldn't want to be f-ing that up," and i agree. %$* 537
we don't know, and we really don't want to be messing that up. %$* 537
and that means we need to scale back, slow down, and resist the boom mentality. %$* 537
we have to scale back. %$* 537
we do not have to drill hundreds of thousands of wells just because we can. %$* 537
we don't have to drill near elementary schools, and we can protect our state forests and our parks. %$* 537
we need to slow down. %$* 537
we need to take the time to let the science catch up with the practice and the safeguards catch up with the science, and we need the resources to ensure that the rules we have in place are vigorously enforced. %$* 537
there's no rush. %$* 537
the gas has been there for millions of years. %$* 537
it's not going away. %$* 537
finally, we have to ignore the advertising slogans on both sides, the demonizing goes on on both sides, filling the airways, and stop living in a fantasy world of endless fossil fuel consumption without consequences. %$* 537
we need to restart the conversation about putting a price on carbon, and we need to develop a real meaningful energy policy, not “all of the above.” that's no policy at all. %$* 537
does that make sense to you? %$* 537
do you want to limit the intensive gas development and the breakneck speed of fracking until we answer the open scientific questions and put policies in place to ensure that we are not messing up? %$* 537
then you should vote for us, because you recognize, as we do, that until we have those safeguards in place and until we have that information, we have nothing but an uncontrolled experiment and the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 537
thank you very much, deborah goldberg. %$* 13
and that concludes round 3 and this intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
and now it's time to find which side you feel has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
remember, we had you vote at the beginning of the debate on where you stood on this motion, no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good." you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
we want to ask you to judge which side presented their arguments best. %$* 13
if you agree that this side presented the best arguments, the side that is for the motion, but that means that they are against, in a broad sense, fracking, push number one. %$* 13
if it’s the other side, which takes the opposite position, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll lock in the results in about 10 seconds, and in about 90 seconds we'll have the numbers for the two comparisons. %$* 13
so while that's being tabulated backstage, i just want to-- %$* 13
i really want to thank these debaters for doing what we asked them to do which was really bring good arguments to the-- %$* 13
and also just by point of comparison, it's our first time in aspen, and, you know, as a rule, audience questions can be a sort of tricky area to go to. %$* 13
tonight, this audience was spectacular in the questions, not just in the format, but really you moved things along, you put very, very interesting things into this debate, so i want to give yourselves a round of applause for that. %$* 13
did really good. %$* 13
so just a few things to say, we want to again thank the aspen institute for inviting us down to this year's ideas festival, for letting you see what it is that we do back in new york at intelligence squared u.s.thank you very much for the american clean skies foundation, for their underwriting support for this, and making it all happen. %$* 13
and if some of you are new yorkers or going to new york, we want to let you know that this fall-- %$* 13
what we intend to do with our series of debate topics is to try to follow the ebb and flow of the dialogue that's taking place in the presidential election, and keep-- %$* 13
you know, bounce off what's actually happening in that debate by exploring the issues in more depth in our own debates. %$* 13
and so the motions that we're working on now will be announced in several weeks, and also who the debaters will be. %$* 13
so we have a website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
you can go look to that. %$* 13
you can buy tickets there and keep in touch with us. %$* 13
and if you get to new york, please do come. %$* 13
also, in mid-october, we're going to be on the road again. %$* 13
we're going to be going this time to chicago. %$* 13
this'll be our second annual chicago ideas week. %$* 13
if you're in new york, i should say, our-- %$* 13
we're changing locations. %$* 13
we're going to the kauffman center, which is near lincoln center. %$* 13
we can be seen on public television in new york and also here and around the country on the 220+ npr stations. %$* 13
we also have a podcast that is on itunes. %$* 13
and we have a newsletter. %$* 13
you can sign up for our website. %$* 13
so again, thank you very much for the debaters and for your participation. %$* 13
and now we have the results, and we'll find out what happened. %$* 13
so remember, before the debate we asked you to vote on this motion, no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
if you're for the motion, it means you're saying, "no fracking way." if you're against the motion, you are disagreeing with "no fracking way." so before the debate, 38 percent of you were for the motion "no fracking way," 53 percent were against. %$* 13
after the-- %$* 13
i'm sorry-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, it's a split. %$* 13
i'm going to start this again. %$* 13
before the debate, 38 percent of you were for the motion, 38 percent, against, evenly split, and 24 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 53 percent of you are for the motion "no fracking way," that's up 15 percent, 42 percent are against, that's up only four percent, five percent are undecided, that means the team arguing for the motion "no fracking way," has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan of intelligence squared u.s., and we'll see you next time. %$* 13

i agree that there’s a serious tension there, but it’s not going to move our discussion along. %$* 13
but thank you. %$* 13
i say that respectfully. %$* 13
well, but there is actually something to say about this. %$* 222
can i just-- %$* 222
can i say something to that? %$* 222
it’s not about-- %$* 222
i’m not going to talk about-- %$* 222
i’m going to talk about immigration, i promise you, i promise you. %$* 222
save it for your closing remarks. %$* 13
and for many industries, the choice is actually do we send the jobs abroad or do we have the immigrants come here? %$* 222
for, in agriculture, if immigrants don’t come here, i guarantee you, americans are not going to go out into the fields and pick lettuce and pick fruit. %$* 222
we will start outsourcing-- %$* 222
the majority of employees in those fields are americans right now. %$* 221
we will start outsourcing agriculture. %$* 222
according to the census, the majority-- %$* 221
56 percent are americans in those fields right now. %$* 221
okay, so ma’am, you did have a good question. %$* 13
i acknowledge. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
but they’re supervisors, not the workers. %$* 222
i don’t see how our latest economic pitfalls of-- %$* 18
with the tours that we’re running and the enormous deficit are caused by-- %$* 18
how are the immigrants, illegal or legal are a drag to our economy or to causing a drag on our economy? %$* 18
well, see, you heard the numbers, although they're somewhat disputed about the fiscal drag. %$* 221
i think everybody's coming to an agreement, democratic or republican alike that we have to get a hold of this deficit, $1.4 trillion a year. %$* 221
million unemployed caused by the illegal immigrants? %$* 18
well, if we don't create-- %$* 221
if we do not create, in this country, 200,000 jobs a month, that's 200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in order for us to climb out of this recession, okay? %$* 221
most economists agree that that's the number. %$* 221
we haven't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time. %$* 221
but we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally, let alone the numbers that come across the border and fly in this country and stay, which is a significant number. %$* 221
it's not just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country. %$* 221
and so they're part of the problem. %$* 221
where do those jobs go? %$* 221
okay. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i can't have you debating with him. %$* 13
but thank you for your question. %$* 13
and we're going to take a short break and come back with more of your questions. %$* 13
welcome back. %$* 13
our motion is “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” this is a debate from “intelligence squared u.s.” we are in the question-and- answer section of the debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have two teams of two sides each arguing this motion, “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” and now to some more questions. %$* 13
there's a woman, if you did that-- %$* 13
talk about potential changes to our existing immigration policy, and i wonder if the against side would also talk about what changes you would make, because i think most people would agree that what we have now doesn't work tremendously well. %$* 19
so the key and the most important change-- %$* 222
tamar jacoby. %$* 13
is that we give the workers who we're going to need in the future a way to come legally. %$* 222
right now, we don't need that many foreign workers. %$* 222
we need some in agriculture. %$* 222
and at the high end, we don't need that many. %$* 222
but in the future when the economy picks up, and americans go back to their better jobs and their year-round jobs, and they start to go to restaurants, and they start to go to hotels, and we start to build houses again, we're going to need immigrant workers. %$* 222
and on that day, i say we want to have them come legally as opposed to illegally. %$* 222
if our economy needs them, have them come legally. %$* 222
i also think we need enforcement. %$* 222
our opponents aren't wrong about enforcement. %$* 222
we do need better enforcement on the border and better enforcement in the workplace to make sure-- %$* 222
we need to create legal channels and enforce against the people who are coming illegally. %$* 222
and we need some answer for the 11 million people who are already here and are not going home no matter how miserable we make them with police stops and other things. %$* 222
you know, maybe some of them will go home-- %$* 222
but doesn't your argument for the enforcement that would keep the numbers down fight your argument that we need the workers and the-- %$* 13
no, no. %$* 222
you need-- %$* 222
the best answer for illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. %$* 222
if people are coming to work here, give them a legal way to come and then stop the illegals coming-- %$* 222
i would also just add really, very quickly, that this idea that everybody agrees that they broke the law. %$* 220
but there are a million different ways that people break the law every single day of the year. %$* 220
and for instance, if you break the law, and you're speeding, you mentioned speeding earlier, or you're breaking the law because you don't have insurance, and you're driving, or you're breaking the law because, for some other reason, one of the models that's out there is something called deferred adjudication. %$* 220
so as a lawyer you know, kris, that basically under deferred adjudication, you still get punished either by paying a fine or doing community service. %$* 220
and as long as you don't commit another crime within a certain amount of time, you're able, basically, to wipe that off your record and get on with your life. %$* 220
that happens millions and millions of times. %$* 220
i would imagine in just about every state in the united states. %$* 220
something like an amnesty. %$* 13
it's not like the model is not there already. %$* 220
kris, it is. %$* 13
kris kobach. %$* 13
amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick-- %$* 221
for four reasons. %$* 221
number one, you're going to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple. %$* 221
the 89.3-- %$* 221
$89.1 billion a year that we're losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years. %$* 221
that was according to the robert rector study in 2007.the reason is simple. %$* 221
right now, illegal aliens get food stamps, medicaid, free school lunches, k through 12 education. %$* 221
if they become legalized, then they get the big ones. %$* 221
then they get medicare and social security. %$* 221
and the price goes way, way up. %$* 221
talk about the golden door. %$* 221
number two, it won't just be 11.3 million. %$* 221
the last time we had a major amnesty in 1986, according to the ins's own records, 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they were already here and grabbed the amnesty. %$* 221
number three, we've been hearing about the terrorists. %$* 221
we mentioned that earlier about the terrorists coming in. %$* 221
the notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this population and know who the terrorists are and who they aren't is demonstrably false. %$* 221
mahmud abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the ’93 attack on the world trade center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty. %$* 221
and number four, it's a slap in the face to the people-- %$* 221
everybody who paid the price-- %$* 18
who did it the right way. %$* 221
and did it the right way. %$* 18
no one's talking about amnesty. %$* 222
we're talking about asking people to make restitution and get right with the law. %$* 222
nobody's talking about amnesty. %$* 222
a slap on the wrist, and then you get to stay. %$* 221
that's called amnesty. %$* 221
no. %$* 220
i would say, kris, that that that's an open question. %$* 220
in other words, how much are you going to punish, just bluntly, how can you punish them for having broken the law? %$* 220
i think that there is room to maneuver among reasonable people there. %$* 220
third row, beige sweater. %$* 13
wait for the mic, okay? %$* 13
i'm really concerned about the argument, the fiscal argument that this group over here is making in regards to the fiscal impact. %$* 19
when you support the attrition through enforcement strategy, that strategy has detained thousands of-- %$* 19
hundreds of thousands of people over-- %$* 19
almost 400,000 people were deported last year. %$* 19
there is about 30,000 immigrants detained in facilities all across our country that is costing the american people, including immigrants, because they are contributing to the economy and to taxes, $1.7 billion. %$* 19
there's 30,000-- %$* 19
you're saying there's a cost to enforcement. %$* 13
there's a cost. %$* 19
and that's just the detention cost. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
let's let-- %$* 13
so that has-- %$* 19
and that is also, you know, in terms of our values of being here in the united states, what does that speak to to the people who are here, that we-- %$* 19
you know, do we want to be viewed as a country that is detaining 30,000 people in detention and deporting almost 400,000 people? %$* 19
i don't think that that's the values that the united states is really portraying across the country. %$* 19
kris kobach. %$* 13
as a lawyer who has worked in this area, you're right. %$* 221
it's about 30,000 who are detained. %$* 221
those are people in deportation proceedings. %$* 221
we call them removal proceedings. %$* 221
but that's a small percentage of the total number of people who are being removed from the country at any given time. %$* 221
and the reason that 30,000 is actually too low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings, and then the judge says, at the end of the immigration removal hearing, "you are deported," hands him a removal letter, 93 percent will abscond. %$* 221
they will leave. %$* 221
they will disobey the letter. %$* 221
and it's known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter. %$* 221
and so if you don't detain, they don't go. %$* 221
and if we believe that our courts have any meaning, and are nothing more than just a laughing stock, we have got to try to detain the ones that present the highest risk of leaving-- %$* 221
but the point is the whole system is broken. %$* 222
of people in detention, a lot of these people in detention don't even have an attorney, don't have any due process. %$* 19
and that needs to be addressed. %$* 19
and do we want-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 221
every immigration hearing has a right to an attorney. %$* 221
as the american public, to be viewed as-- %$* 19
kris, kris, i don't want you debating with the audience. %$* 13
but your passion has been registered and respected. %$* 13
sir, on the same aisle to your left. %$* 13
let the mic go back down. %$* 13
gentleman in the purple tie. %$* 13
oh, it's coming the other way. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, sir. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
the con side has both been saying there’s not enough legal immigration. %$* 18
but it's been briefly mentioned we do accept 1 million permanent legal immigrants each year and about-- %$* 18
and nearly a million temporary workers, and that number has not gone down since the recession. %$* 18
ms. %$* 18
jacoby says that you support-- %$* 18
we don't need it now. %$* 18
so would you support a moratorium until the jobs go back up? %$* 18
and also how many people, 15 million people apply for the diversity lottery alone. %$* 18
so how many do you want in the country before you-- %$* 18
so the point is that the market-- %$* 222
tamar jacoby. %$* 13
works really well to attract people-- %$* 222
when times are good, the market attracts people. %$* 222
and when times are bad, people get the signal all the way to their villages in mexico, and they don't come. %$* 222
since the downturn, half as many people have been coming every year from mexico, half. %$* 222
people hear that there are no jobs, and so they don't come. %$* 222
they're not coming for welfare. %$* 222
they're not coming for unemployment. %$* 222
they don't get those things. %$* 222
they're coming to work. %$* 222
and that's-- %$* 222
we should be happy about that. %$* 222
that's attrition by bad economy, though. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 222
we should be happy that the market sends the signals. %$* 222
and the system that-- %$* 222
tom tancredo. %$* 13
i think we should have is a way for when the market is good and attracting people, those people who are coming to work should be able to come legally. %$* 222
i don't think we need people working here and being-- %$* 222
tom tancredo. %$* 13
tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction. %$* 219
without the jobs, they don't come. %$* 219
without the jobs, they go back. %$* 219
therefore, it's an enforcement issue. %$* 219
something that's called-- %$* 219
right now, it's a program that's voluntary. %$* 219
it should be mandatory. %$* 219
it's called e- verify, just a requirement that every employer use a process that-- %$* 219
i'm for e-verify. %$* 222
actually verifies whether the person is-- %$* 219
has got a good social security number. %$* 219
now, can it be-- %$* 219
can there be problems? %$* 219
of course. %$* 219
you can steal the social security. %$* 219
but it's a great use of a tool that's out there that would not cost a great deal of money, it's an easy process, and it would have the effect if tamara's right that people won't come if they hear there's no jobs, it would have the effect i think also of saying i believe if there are no jobs-- %$* 219
julián castro. %$* 13
so many people left, by the way-- %$* 219
julián castro. %$* 13
so many people left in arizona-- %$* 219
let me just say that i agree that jobs are what drive folks over here. %$* 220
i disagree with the idea that if those jobs aren't there at a given time that they're necessarily just going to go back. %$* 220
you know, the point was made very early that these folks-- %$* 220
let's say that you've had a job for 12 years, 13 years, and you've had-- %$* 220
and you're married now and you have children who are united states citizens, you know, for the children the united states is home. %$* 220
mexico or wherever they're from is not home. %$* 220
and in many ways, mexico isn't even the place that feels like home anymore. %$* 220
so it's a much more complicated issue than just to say if you press this button then this is going to happen. %$* 220
that's not reality. %$* 220
that's not %$* 220
okay, we have time for one more question that i want to get in, sir, at the far edge, if you could stand up. %$* 13
hi, this question’s for the pro side, what would you tell to the people like the teenagers, the low skilled american worker, people with the minority communities, who are trying to get jobs, but yet some of those jobs been taken by illegal immigrants and those are those jobs they could have probably had? %$* 18
so i work with seasonal employers. %$* 222
i just did a survey of a couple hundred of-- %$* 222
actually probably up to 500 seasonal employers. %$* 222
these are like resorts in remote places and fruit picking and seasonal work. %$* 222
and i asked them, are more americans showing up now in the downturn to apply for these jobs? %$* 222
and what they tell me is in the past, no, americans showed up to work in a seasonal job but, yes, this year a little uptick in the numbers of americans showing up, but then when they learn that it's only a seasonal job and that it's physically-- %$* 222
that it's outside and that it's not going to lead to anything, that they're going to have to leave at the end, people are not taking those jobs, staying for maybe a few weeks and then leaving. %$* 222
the americans are not competing with immigrants. %$* 222
they're mostly doing jobs that americans do not-- %$* 222
are not wanting to do. %$* 222
they-- %$* 221
kris kobach. %$* 13
let's not talk about one anecdote, let's talk about data in whole industries. %$* 221
there is no industry that expresses this more than the meatpacking industry. %$* 221
the meatpacking industry 30 years ago was almost entirely worked by u.s.citizens, the green bay packers, a bunch of, you know, whole cities built on meatpacking. %$* 221
but today, the meatpacking industry is about half and half, about half illegal aliens, half u.s.citizens. %$* 221
we see exactly what happens when the ins, now ice goes and shuts down a meatpacking company because-- %$* 221
or does a raid, and suddenly 300 employees have gone out. %$* 221
there was a raid in georgia a few years ago, and they had two to 300 employees were arrested. %$* 221
what happened? %$* 221
wages went up. %$* 221
they had to go up. %$* 221
they went from $6.75 an hour, and then they went up to $7.75 an hour, and what happened was u.s. citizens and legal aliens started taking the jobs once the wages got high enough. %$* 221
but you're leaving out the turnover also went up. %$* 222
that’s exactly what has to happen. %$* 221
the turnover went through the roof because people do the jobs for a little while and then they don’t want to do them anymore. %$* 222
twenty years ago, the average wage in meatpacking was about $12 an hour. %$* 221
and that's-- %$* 222
now it’s about eight dollars an hour, that’s not in real dollars that’s in absolute dollars. %$* 221
there’s no other industry-- %$* 221
i have to separate the you because that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
oh, no. %$* 222
and here’s where we are, we're about to hear brief opening statements-- %$* 13
we're about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and remember how you voted before the debate because immediately after their closing statements we’re going to ask you to vote again and the team that has changed the most minds according to your votes will be picked-- %$* 13
declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round three closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "don’t give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses," and here to argue against the motion, against the don’t, julián castro, mayor of san antonio, texas, the seventh largest city in the united states. %$* 13
all right, well thank you very much for giving us this audience this evening. %$* 220
you've heard arguments on both sides tonight. %$* 220
but i want you to think about at the end of the day what the united states of america stands for, what it stood for from its founding and what it stands for in this year 2011.the united states has always stood for opening up the doors of opportunity to folks around the world. %$* 220
and that means that through the years there have been many folks who came here legally and there have also been many folks who came here illegally. %$* 220
it is undisputed that folks who are both legal and illegal are making an enormous economic contribution to the united states. %$* 220
in fact, depending on the studies whether it’s a one percent difference or a three percent difference, they are contributing in taxes, in creating jobs for others, in economic impact in founding companies, and our folks on the other side are trying to have it both ways, to say that, yes, throughout history we’ve become the number one economy in the world because of all of these immigrants. %$* 220
and many of them were illegal during that time as well. %$* 220
but something has changed. %$* 220
we have to change the entire identify of the country. %$* 220
i don’t believe that that’s true. %$* 220
i believe that the evidence bears out that, yes, we can strengthen our enforcement, but we need to deal with the 11 million folks who are here illegally, punish them for the fact that they broke the law, and then give them a chance at the back, at the end of the line, to become citizens eventually, and to deal with the fact that the american economy needs these influx of workers. %$* 220
in 2012, we’ll have the oldest average age for an american worker in our history, 41.6 years. %$* 220
we have a declining workforce that must be replenished by immigrants to the united states. %$* 220
and there’s no better place to deliver that message than new york city, the city of immigrants that has become the greatest city in the world. %$* 220
thank you, julián castro. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
our motion is "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." and here to argue for the motion, for the “don’t,” tom tancredo, a former congressman from colorado. %$* 13
i mentioned that i first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation i believe that it provides. %$* 219
and i think tonight’s a good example, that it certainly does that. %$* 219
it is a fascinating discussion, and i sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the other side of this. %$* 219
i would say that there is, for america, i think all of us at this table want exactly what has been expressed, julián, by you, certainly an opportunity for people who come here, an opportunity to do great things. %$* 219
i also want for people who live here, for people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity, to have the ability to actually get a job, progress through the system, and especially the ones-- %$* 219
i’m talking about the ones that have done it the right way. %$* 219
nothing hurts-- %$* 219
there’s no group of people in the united states that’s more negatively impacted by massive immigration, both legal and illegal, of low-skilled, low-wage people, than the people who are here legally, who are low-skilled, low-wage people. %$* 219
they are our citizens. %$* 219
why is it so hard for us to think about them, to think about their needs? %$* 219
for the most part, you know, when we’re talking about the immigration process and these people, they came the right way. %$* 219
and, by the way, this has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, absolutely nothing. %$* 219
i assure you that if italy was on our southern border, had as much poverty, as much population, we would have just as many problems with italians coming across that border illegally. %$* 219
it’s got nothing to do with ethnicity, nothing. %$* 219
although it’s always tried to be - - people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism. %$* 219
is it out there? %$* 219
of course. %$* 219
but i’ll tell you what, it does not motivate me. %$* 219
all i want is for this country to achieve its goals. %$* 219
i want it to be the place, yeah, that, still, everybody wants to come because we have a vibrant economy in which most of the people here are doing well, in fact, all of the people are doing well, and this is-- %$* 219
tom tancredo, your time’s up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 219
our motion is "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." and here to argue against the motion, tamar jacoby, who is president and ceo of immigration works usa. %$* 13
well, in conclusion, i would just like to sharpen the choice here a little bit. %$* 222
i think what you’ve heard is we all agree that the immigration system we have isn’t working, but we differ in a very sharp way about what the solution is. %$* 222
our opponents say that the solution has one dimension. %$* 222
it’s enforcement and enforcement only. %$* 222
we say that the solution has several dimensions. %$* 222
yes, it’s enforcement. %$* 222
yes, it’s security. %$* 222
but it’s also a legal immigration system that works. %$* 222
the best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. %$* 222
and i urge-- %$* 222
and the other place we disagree is we disagree over whether immigration and, really, the economy in america and american life is a zero-sum game or not. %$* 222
our opponents are saying they have the vision of america that leaves no room for people with energy and grit and entrepreneurialism who want to come here and make better lives for their families, but also make america a better place. %$* 222
they have no room for-- %$* 222
their vision leaves no room for hope and for an expansive america. %$* 222
their vision is that there’s never enough of anything and that’s it’s a zero-sum game. %$* 222
and our point is that that’s just not true in america. %$* 222
yes, we’re in a hard time now, but that hard time is not going to last forever. %$* 222
immigrants don't take jobs. %$* 222
they create them. %$* 222
immigrants don't threaten us. %$* 222
they bring talent and vitality. %$* 222
american culture and society haven't lost their appeal. %$* 222
immigrants are as drawn to them as ever, and immigrants are still integrating or assimilating every bit as fast as they did in the past. %$* 222
so i think the notion is exactly wrong. %$* 222
shutting the gates now would be a disastrous policy. %$* 222
we need immigrants to create jobs and grow. %$* 222
and that need's only going to get stronger as the economy recovers. %$* 222
just saying no isn't an answer. %$* 222
it's a fantasy, and it's an un- american fantasy at that. %$* 222
thank you, tamar jacoby. %$* 13
our motion is “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” and here to argue for the motion, kris kobach, secretary of state of kansas and co-author of arizona's s.b. 1070, the legal immigration law. %$* 13
i just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly. %$* 221
julián just mentioned this notion that if we had an amnesty, it would be just fine. %$* 221
it'd be fair because the illegal aliens would go to the end of the line. %$* 221
legally speaking, that's impossible. %$* 221
when you have an amnesty, you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here. %$* 221
they have been automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do it the right way. %$* 221
there is no such thing as the end of the line. %$* 221
as soon as you grant an amnesty, the person is automatically at the front of the line. %$* 221
and then we heard from them earlier that we shouldn't have a policy that fluctuates, encourages immigration some years, it discourages it depending on the needs of the u.s.economy. %$* 221
it should be pretty much wide open all the time. %$* 221
no. %$* 221
that's exactly what we want. %$* 221
we want immigration policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the united states because we owe our highest duty to our own citizens. %$* 221
and finally, we hear about this point again and again, and they're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs americans won't do. %$* 221
and we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because americans won't do those jobs. %$* 221
now, remember, i told you the statistics. %$* 221
americans are doing those jobs. %$* 221
but there's a cultural problem with that argument too. %$* 221
it's encouraging high school kids today, many of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a briggs and stratton lawnmower engine, to believe that certain jobs are beneath them. %$* 221
i would say that is un-american. %$* 221
our country is built on manual labor, everybody going through a period in their life when they worked a job like that, and then they moved on. %$* 221
well, this attitude of, let the immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society. %$* 221
and so i'll conclude-- %$* 221
conclude with this. %$* 221
don't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our poor american citizens, who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work need those jobs. %$* 221
they need also the welfare state to survive. %$* 221
and those things are not going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration continuing, which an amnesty would further. %$* 221
so let's look after our own tired and our own poor and then look at immigration in terms of what services our national interests. %$* 221
thank you, kris kobach. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we're asking you to go again to the key pads to the right of your seat and to register your vote. %$* 13
we will get the readout almost immediately. %$* 13
so our motion is “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” and if you agree with this motion, if you agree with don't give us, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are-- %$* 13
remain undecided or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and it'll lock in. %$* 13
so we're done with the excitement of the evening. %$* 13
and i just want to say that in an issue that was as contentious as this, i so respected how these two teams actually respected the argument and respected each other's arguments enough to hear them, and i want to congratulate them all. %$* 13
and i personally stood to learn some things from the questioners, including yours, ma'am, which i rejected. %$* 13
turned out to be a great question. %$* 13
and as far as your question and the argument that you want to have with kris kobach, he'll be right there afterwards, and he'll be waiting for you. %$* 13
but thank you, all of you for all of your questions. %$* 13
they really helped the process a great deal. %$* 13
so this spring, our theme has been “america's house divided.” and tonight's debate was the last part of this spring season of our regularly scheduled debates. %$* 13
but we now are happy to announce that we're having a special sixth debate that's going to take place next month. %$* 13
we're just putting it together now. %$* 13
and it's in partnership with the film society of lincoln center and in conjunction with the opening of the documentary called “page one: a year inside the new york times.” and the motion that we're going to be debating is this: “the first amendment does not entitle the press to print state secrets.”that debate’s going to be taking place here at the skirball center on wednesday, june 8th. %$* 13
and we're going to be announcing who our lineup of debaters is quite shortly. %$* 13
tickets are available, though, already at the skirball box office and also through our web site. %$* 13

all of our debates-- %$* 13
we said this before, and you've been very, very gracious in doing the radio bits. %$* 13
and if you listen to the npr broadcast, you can hear your own applause. %$* 13
that will be you, especially you out there with that distinctive clap. %$* 13
they will be heard on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
and you can watch the debate on bloomberg television networks starting next monday. %$* 13
so visit bloomberg.com for your local channel. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so it's all-- %$* 13
we've been given the results. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes the most minds is declared our victor. %$* 13
our motion is “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” before the debate, 16 percent of you were for the motion, 54 percent were against, and 30 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 35 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that's up 19 percent. %$* 13
52 percent are against. %$* 13
that's down 2 percent. %$* 13
13 percent are undecided. %$* 13
that means the team arguing for the motion carried the day. %$* 13
“don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” has been carried. %$* 13
our congratulations to that side. %$* 13
thanks from me, john donvan and “intelligence squared u.s.” %$* 13

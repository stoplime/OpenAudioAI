it is today the most respected institution in afghanistan— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 568
and— %$* 13
already. %$* 568
and, and your teammate would like to come in as well. %$* 13
james shinn. %$* 13
well, you know, we’re not really good at building institutions anywhere, as i think you pointed out in your question, and i concur with dr. %$* 570
lang on that point. %$* 570
but in the end the afghans are going to do this. %$* 570
i mean, eight years is a long time, but it’s pretty fast to come from basically devastation %$* 570
three decades of destruction, at the hands of various invaders, to actually hold an election themselves. %$* 570
i mean it’s pretty amazing, and when you travel through the provinces and towns of afghanistan, and you see what was there before, and you see what’s there now %$* 570
it’s— so that’s the answer, the afghans are going to work it out. %$* 570
ma’am, down in front— %$* 13
and they’re in the process of working it out and it’s very impressive— %$* 570
—whoa, whoa, whoa— %$* 569
this is not, i mean, honestly, the— %$* 567
i—the problem is we’re about out of time— %$* 13
our greatest legacy— %$* 567
steve— %$* 13
—of our vision there— %$* 567
steve— %$* 13
—is leaving the military—? %$* 567
can you save that for your summary remarks— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 13
yeah, well— %$* 567
thank you. %$* 13
ma’am. %$* 13
let me just say that would just be very bleak. %$* 567
yeah. %$* 565
well he asked the best question of the night, this is the question the president’s supposed to be asking himself— %$* 569
but ralph, you’ve— %$* 13
and nobody else— %$* 569
—you’ve answered it in advance a few times— %$* 13
yeah, but— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
let me go—let me go to this— %$* 13
no, nobody’s articulating the answer— %$* 569
—let me go to this woman and— %$* 13
nobody is articulating the answer— %$* 569
—and our last question, please. %$* 13
that’s a good question— %$* 13
my name is elsa ross-greifinger. %$* 575
and the only qualification i have is that i’m a united states citizen. %$* 575
and, i’m troubled by several things. %$* 575
question. %$* 575
there has been so much emphasis on afghanistan. %$* 575
i would like to know, your approach to pakistan, which after all is a different country, and this lecture was supposed to be, this debate, about the two countries, and i have not heard very much about your approach to pakistan. %$* 575
secondly, there was an article in the international herald tribune today, talking about the fact that in pakistan, they absolutely detest us, they want no part of us, and i would like to know how that problem also affects our approach. %$* 575
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 575
thank you. %$* 13
that can go to both sides. %$* 13
it’s a great— %$* 566
steve coll, first, and you’re on the side arguing that america can succeed. %$* 13
that’s a great question, american policy in pakistan over the last 30 years has been a failure. %$* 566
and only now are we proving the value—the truth of churchill’s quip that after trying everything else we eventually get it right. %$* 566
the congress passed kerry-luger legislation last year making a long, deep commitment, not to the pakistan army, but to the pakistani people, to the pakistani constitutional system, to pluralism and development in pakistan, and for the first time we are send— our government is sending a clear and reliable signal that we intend to invest in the broader health of the pakistani state and its future success. %$* 566
the standing of the united states and public opinion in pakistan is low. %$* 566
it is unfortunately three times higher now than it was just a few years ago. %$* 566
i don’t think that’s the metric of our success. %$* 566
our interests do not lie in being popular in pakistan, our interests lie in pakistan succeeding. %$* 566
and the biggest change in public opinion that’s will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) occurred in pakistan during the last two years and it’s very recent has been the decision by broadly based, diverse pakistanis to reject the violence, the nihilist violence, of the taliban and al-qaeda. %$* 566
they have been the victims, of this—of their own frankenstein monster, and they’ve come to recognize that they will not live in a country, they cannot live in a country, that is influenced by these groups. %$* 566
the united states has an obligation and interest in supporting that momentum. %$* 566
in the end, that’s what allows us to protect our own security and ultimately exit from south asia, so i don’t think it’s a popularity contest. %$* 566
it’s about the success of pakistanis themselves and they’re well on their way, in a region where, by the way, india’s own success is already lifting pakistan into new directions, creating new incentives for economic integration and regional stability. %$* 566
and let’s hear from the side that argues america cannot succeed. %$* 13
i think— %$* 567
steve clemons— %$* 13
i think what steve coll just shared is true, but there’s also another truth in pakistan, where, you get equations like the ally of our ally will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) turns out to be our enemy. %$* 567
and to some degree, there was a time when i had lunch with the former head of isi and i was late to the lunch like i often am and didn’t know it was the former head of %$* 567
can you tell the audience who isi is. %$* 13
isi is the—what’s it stand for, the— %$* 567
interservice— %$* 565
interservice intelligence, they’re the bad guys’ cia in, they’re the intelligence services. %$* 567
and you were having lunch— %$* 13
and they’re off, they are rumored to have helped seed the terrorist groups in mumbai and they are active with some elements of the taliban. %$* 567
and i asked this general, i said does president musharraf, then-president musharraf control the isi and this general jurani told me that president musharraf has a lot to gain by acting like he doesn’t. %$* 567
and, in that kind of world, it’s, as will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) steve coll knows better than anyone else, you have a problem where we’re not always quite sure where the security apparatus of that state is. %$* 567
and that regardless, and i agree completely that something interesting has been achieved in pakistan, so let them have it. %$* 567
let them become their own barriers to islamic jihadism and the most extreme elements of their societies. %$* 567
and i think if you’re fair with pakistan society they’ve done a fairly good job of keeping the minority extreme parties %$* 567
islamist parties have been kept a minority in their political system. %$* 567
let that continue to percolate, i don’t think it’s quite as vulnerable at even the point where we were worried before the swat offensive. %$* 567
so, to a certain degree that’s there but i also worry about the fact that, the isi may be taking us for a ride again, where we don’t quite know when they’re going to push buttons that actually destabilize the situation. %$* 567
i think steve is right to say we have an opportunity to maybe get a deal, a grand bargain. %$* 567
but i have some concerns about that, just given the behaviors we’ve seen, and our own lack of contact with a whole range of managers, colonels and majors, within the isi today that maybe pat lang needs to go over and spend some time with but— %$* 567
again—? %$* 565
—i have a lot of doubts about that equation and the stability of it. %$* 567
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 567
i the man in my ear has not spoken to me for a long time, it’s apparently dead, but i’m getting a hand signal, that we do have time for one more question. %$* 13
and and i’m getting hand signals to go %$* 13
there. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i’m not sure. %$* 13
well, i’m going to choose so— %$* 13
—right over there. %$* 576
oh, i’m—i apologize, there was a mic already there. %$* 13
i need to turn that— %$* 13
we all know who he is. %$* 565
i have a question for the cannot and will not side because what you’re essentially advocating, is a counterterrorism strategy using long-range strikes to kill terrorist leaders in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 9
now as you know, stan mcchrystal— %$* 9
no. %$* 565
no, no, that’s not what we’re advocating— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
—was in charge of the joint special op— isn’t that what you’re advocating, ralph, when you say— %$* 9
no. %$* 569
—kill them and get out? %$* 9
i—where did i ever say kill them and get out. %$* 569
you show me one place. %$* 569
one of my books, one article, one tv show, when did i say that. %$* 569
that’s just nonsense. %$* 569
what i said was what—joe biden’s saying. %$* 569
that we need a small, lethal force focused on our enemies. %$* 569
of course we need boots on the ground— %$* 569
well that’s, ralph, if i could ask my question, that’s basically what’s known as a counterterrorism strategy— %$* 9
yeah— %$* 569
—that’s the alternative to the counterinsurgency strategy that the other side is advocating. %$* 9
my question is, as you know, stan mcchrystal was our top counterterrorist, he was the head of the will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) joint special operations command, from 2003 to 2008.he was the guy who was out there in charge of the forces that were capturing saddam hussein, killing abu musab al-zarqawi. %$* 9
he knows more about our special operations capability than anybody else live. %$* 9
but he has conclude that all our counterterrorist capabilities are not capable of keeping us safe in afghanistan and pakistan and that we need to do— %$* 9
that, that is not— %$* 569
—a counterterrorism strategy. %$* 9
so my question for you, ralph— %$* 9
that— %$* 569
—and the others— %$* 9
want to hear what the question is— %$* 13
my question is— %$* 9
yeah, what is the question— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
my question is, why do you have more confidence in our counterterrorist capabilities than our top counterterrorist general. %$* 9
well, for two reasons. %$* 569
first of all because, you’re mixing apples and oranges— %$* 569
do i get to answer this—? %$* 9
general mcchrystal was given a mission, by the president. %$* 569
and the mission was pacify afghanistan. %$* 569
he succeeded wonderfully, in the counterterrorism. %$* 569
but he has failed miserably and we will continue to fail, in the pacification effort. %$* 569
now, nobody—i hate this stuff where people twist what you say. %$* 569
i said that we need a compact, lethal force, you need boots on the ground for intelligence, you need special forces, you need enough conventional forces for raising security. %$* 569
you probably need 15 or 25,000 guys. %$* 569
you don’t need 120,000 guys, and so, again, let’s—please, let’s be fair to each other and listen to what the other persons say, and not try to score points. %$* 569
the other answer is this. %$* 569
i get calls from the military around the world. %$* 569
there’s a myth out there that the military supports general mcchrystal’s strategy. %$* 569
the calls i get are running about 50 to 1 against sending more troops. %$* 569
only call or message will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) i’ve gotten supporting general mcchrystal’s strategy, came from kabul, and one of general mcchrystal’s subordinates. %$* 569
and that concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
and, here’s where we are %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each of the debaters, they will be two minutes each, they will be uninterrupted and, this is their last chance to try to change your minds before we vote, and, to recall, before the debate began we asked you to vote, your stance on this motion which is “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan,” here are the results of that preliminary debate %$* 13
that preliminary vote. %$* 13
48 percent of you were for the motion, 25 percent of you were against, and 27 percent were undecided. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote one more time, and pick the winner just a few minutes from now, but, now, round 3, closing statements, and to close first, steve coll, president and ceo of the new america foundation and a staff writer at the new yorker. %$* 13
he is arguing against the motion, america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 13
well thanks, i’ve enjoyed the evening and, i came here not very much interested in the debate and the competition but interested in the discourse and the moment in the country’s life and the opportunity to speak freely about how i see a very complicated will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) problem. %$* 566
and i think we’ve done that in a lot of good ways, so i hate to get sort of all technical and debatey on you but i would point out, that we actually more or less all six of us agree on the question before you which is, that we can succeed. %$* 566
what we disagree with—and we actually all agree on the definition of success, which is an america that’s safe from its enemies, a stable, region, where we have access to our enemies, and we tend to think that we need some kind of afghan state, i think, nobody wants to leave so i take from their willingness to stay that they’re willing to stay in an afghan state. %$* 566
well that’s more or less the minimum interests and definition of success that i outlined at the beginning. %$* 566
what we’ve disagreed about are a lot of really important subjects that are now before the president, they’re just not before you. %$* 566
they’re basically whether or not we should send more troops, whether we should pursue a counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes rural population security versus urban, whether we should invest in afghan security forces or whether we believe in the plausibility of that project to different degrees. %$* 566
but the basic notion is that america does have vital interests in both countries, and that the failure of our efforts to stabilize this region and prevent pakistan, for example, from falling apart, are important enough to take these risks, there are risks in every direction. %$* 566
and i think we’ve had a good conversation about where some of those risks lie, but the fundamental question, do we have a reason to be will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) there, can we through this kind of discourse find the right strategy to succeed, i think we’ve answered that question, all of us, thank you. %$* 566
thank you, steve coll. %$* 13
making his closing statement, patrick lang, retired us military intelligence officer, a former green beret who is arguing that america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan, patrick lang— %$* 13
well i think we’ve moved on beyond that, the question of the day here. %$* 565
i don’t have any quarrel at all really with what steve said there. %$* 565
this is really a question of strategy and methodology, rather than ultimate goals with regard to this place i think. %$* 565
and i would point out to you that i would maintain completely that if in fact we decided to do a countryside wide in the hot parts of afghanistan, all the pashtun, across the pashtun belt and some other places as well, i think that the costs are going to go up so high in all the various ways that i’ve said before, you know, that in a couple years’ time you’re going to decide that there is going to be an endgame, right, because it’s got to—because we’re going to leave. %$* 565
that’s going to be the problem, and that’ll be bad, in a way because, this place will continue to be a breeding ground for islamic zealots who are in league with other islamic zealots in other parts of the world and who are dangerous to us. %$* 565
so that shouldn’t happened, i would will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) propose in fact, instead that what we ought to do, is hold the major cities, make sure that, that the taliban don’t have a seat in the un again, and use these places as bases from which we can affect a strategy of in-depth human penetration of the groups we really don’t like, and the use of various dissident parts of the tribal population that can be used for our purposes and they can be used for our purposes, i—this is not an impossible thing to do. %$* 565
and have a certain number of troops on the ground that you can use for those kinds of purposes. %$* 565
now, that would be a far smaller number of troops probably than we have. %$* 565
now, in that kind of strategy it may well be that there’s not going to be an endgame, in fact. %$* 565
because this place is going to be dangerous for a long, long time, people there are not going to change very quickly, although we’ll do everything we can to improve their lives if they— and it may be necessary to maintain a presence in that country for a very long time, in order to ensure that we can carry out the goals of protecting the american people, that we need to focus on. %$* 565
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, patrick lang. %$* 13
summarizing his position against the motion, john nagl who is president of the center for new american security. %$* 13
john nagl. %$* 13
pat has just described what to my eyes is the critical weakness of a counterterrorism strategy, which is that there is no end state, that will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) we’ll have to be there forever. %$* 568
and i believe that the american people deserve security, and that the afghan people deserve security and that there’s a way to achieve that in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable commitment of resources. %$* 568
i have tried the counterterrorism strategy, i have tried to practice counterinsurgency without enough boots on the ground, in al- anbar province in 2004.i worked to train iraqi police and iraqi army, the insurgents killed them. %$* 568
i worked to build better economic opportunities for the iraqi people, and they were destroyed by the insurgents. %$* 568
and so, much as we would like there to be an easy way out of this, if we ever want to depart afghanistan and have that flank secure, with al-qaeda never again able to use afghanistan as a safe haven for terror, then there is an investment we are going to have to make. %$* 568
we have made an extraordinary investment already, and it is, frankly it is many of my friends, your sons and daughters, your friends who are out making that investment. %$* 568
the best chance for a positive return on that investment, a secure and stable afghanistan, a secure and stable pakistan. %$* 568
objectives that all of us here agree are of vital national interest to the united states, but should be accomplished, and it is within the power of the united states to accomplish. %$* 568
it is my personal belief that the best way to accomplish them, is through a properly resourced counterinsurgency strategy that is the approach advocated by general mcchrystal, it is hard, but hard is not will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) impossible. %$* 568
thank you, john nagl. %$* 13
our motion is “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” and summarizing for the motion, steve clemons, publisher of the political blog, the washington note, steve clemons. %$* 13
america will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan unless it gets its act back together both on the questions of management and strategy, both of which it has failed miserably in over the last eight years with regard to this challenge. %$* 567
the issue is not just afghanistan and pakistan, it’s the bigger picture, of what is going on in the united states, rewriting to some degree america’s place in the world in what i think is a historic moment of opportunity but discontinuity with the past. %$* 567
barack obama has a huge challenge. %$* 567
the mystique of america’s superpower status was somewhat shattered by iraq, where other nations saw our limits, our military limits, our economic limits, and our moral limits. %$* 567
all of that has to be reinvented. %$* 567
and while i’ve heard great arguments from our colleagues on the other side, i have not seen a general understanding that we need to begin thinking about the sort of place and mission we have 20 or 30 or 40 years out. %$* 567
we haven’t will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) discussed nearly enough what alternative strategies might actually generate a better human-rights regime, better opportunities for women democratic rights that we’ve seen fail miserably i think in the recent elections, under our management. %$* 567
we were the stewards of that election that just unfolded, in great degree and to some—and i think no matter where you look, turned out to be quite a bad deal. %$* 567
and trying to restore america’s place and the sense that america has leverage over important global affairs, is really vital in dealing with nuclear nonproliferation. %$* 567
iran, recreating some sense that we have consequence and weight. %$* 567
so it’s not just about afghanistan and pakistan, being stuck in the mud there, and not coming up, and just having a strategy that throws more troops at the challenge, without saying how can you get to some consistent level of benchmarks that are shared within a team both military and on the smart power side of the equation. %$* 567
until that’s done, i can’t see in any way that sending more resources into that fixes those management mistakes. %$* 567
thank you, steve clemons. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, james shinn, former assistant secretary of defense for asia, and national intelligence officer for east asia. %$* 13
i think steve coll said that, that we seem to be converging on agreement, across the room, that we have vital interests, and that will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) we can and will succeed in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 570
we do disagree i think on the tactics, but that’s, again is not the real issue here. %$* 570
i think, looking out ahead that we are going to be having this debate, this national debate about the ends and means in afghanistan and pakistan repetitively, for some period of time. %$* 570
but i also think we have, the president has on his desk a fairly clear strategy, by about the best people we can think to do it. %$* 570
and execution matters %$* 570
properly resourcing it matters, and signaling matters, to the taliban, to the afghans, and to the pakistanis. %$* 570
i think the worst thing we could do, is simply split the difference, put in place some artificial metrics, that we can use to hold, for example the pakistanis accountable, and simply allows things to drift. %$* 570
that would be the worst of all possible worlds. %$* 570
i think we can and we will succeed, in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 570
thank you, james shinn. %$* 13
and, finally to summarize for the motion, ralph peters, a former us, uh, army lieutenant-colonel and author of the war after armageddon. %$* 13
ralph peters. %$* 13
when generals are out of ideas, they ask for more troops. %$* 569
it is stunning to me how little we’ve talked about our troops tonight. %$* 569
this isn’t abstract, they have to do it. %$* 569
our troops are worn down, will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) the equipment’s worn down. %$* 569
but yet they will do anything we ask them to do. %$* 569
if the president asks them to stay in afghanistan in increased numbers by god they’ll do it. %$* 569
but we should ask them to do sensible things. %$* 569
sensible things. %$* 569
missions that could be achieved. %$* 569
so let me leave you, the audience, with a few questions. %$* 569
if the karzai government is worthy, why don’t afghans support it. %$* 569
why did they have to steal an election. %$* 569
if afghans want us to stay, why are our casualties climbing dramatically. %$* 569
if as you heard afghans are fighting, why must we send more troops. %$* 569
if international support is so dramatic, why must we send 40,000 more troops. %$* 569
if we cannot articulate the mission, and the end state, how dare we send more young men and women in uniform, because we won’t force ourselves to answer the fundamental question, of what— why are we there, and what, concretely, do we expect to achieve. %$* 569
so i will leave you, with a question general petraeus asked several years ago about iraq. %$* 569
tell me how this ends. %$* 569
thank you, ralph peters. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing remarks and now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best, it is time for you to pick the winner. %$* 13
we’re asking you right now once again to go those keypads on the left side of your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we are going to get the read-out almost will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) instantaneously, once again our motion is, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” %$* 13
to remind you before the vote %$* 13
48 percent of you were for the motion, 25 percent of you were against the motion, and 27 percent were undecided, and as we said before the side that changes the most minds will be declared the winner. %$* 13
okay, we’re going to lock out the keypads. %$* 13
and the results will be with us in just a second. %$* 13
in the meantime i first of all wanted to thank all of the questioners who actually %$* 13
gave us things with question marks and they really moved the debate along. %$* 13
thank you to all of you and to those of you who we did not get to, i apologize. %$* 13
but we’ll see you next time. %$* 13
and also thank you to all of our panelists for a terrific evening, well argued, honestly argued. %$* 13
our next debate will be tuesday, it’s october 27th, the motion will be, “good riddance to the mainstream media.” panelists for the motion will be the host of public radio’s “the takeaway,” john hockenberry, executive editor of the politico jim vandehei and michael wolff, vanity fair columnist and founder of newser.com. %$* 13
against the motion, executive vice-president and editor-at-large of the san francisco chronicle phil bronstein, columnist and reporter for the new york times david carr, and editor and publisher of the nation, katrina vanden heuvel. %$* 13
all of our debates will continue to be heard on more than 190 npr stations across the country, and, to that point, will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) when i announce the results, just to give the radio broadcast a very nice flourish, at one point my arm will come up and i would love it if you would applaud at that point, and the incentive is knowing that your applause will be heard on 200 npr stations around the world. %$* 13
you can also watch the fall debates on bloomberg’s television network and read about them in the next edition of newsweek. %$* 13
books by tonight’s panelists and dvd’s of past debates are also on sale in the lobby. %$* 13
all right, it is now in. %$* 13
i have been given the results and, remember that the team that changes the most minds is declared the victor, and here it is, before the debate, 48 percent were for the motion, 25 percent were against, 27 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 43 percent are for the motion, 45 percent against, 12 percent undecided, the side against %$* 13
is our winner. %$* 13
congratulations to them, thank you for all of you from me, john donvan, and from intelligence squared us. %$* 13

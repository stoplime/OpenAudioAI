and that’s what you didn’t tell us, how to get that better deal. %$* 334
okay. %$* 13
we can get to that point, but i’d like it if you answer my questions. %$* 13
and my question was that these guys are saying that you’re just naïve to believe that this-- %$* 13
right. %$* 18
thing would stand up. %$* 13
and i’m not saying that disrespectfully because i actually want to get to the points you’re making. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 334
but just to keep a shape to it. %$* 13
i’ll say one word on trust. %$* 334
and i think mike understood that point on trust, the denmark analogy. %$* 334
we don’t need this agreement because we trust iran. %$* 334
it’s precisely because we don’t trust them that we need a verifiable agreement with binding restrictions. %$* 334
let’s go to the other side. %$* 13
mike doran. %$* 13
the agreement doesn’t have binding restrictions. %$* 140
this is the-- %$* 140
the reason that we have gotten any compliance out of the iranians thus far is because we’re paying them to do it. %$* 140
the-- %$* 140
you know, tom mentioned that the agreement is going to require the iranians to come clean on all of their past program, which is an incredibly important aspect of the monitoring mechanism. %$* 140
unless you understand what the program was, you can’t monitor it. %$* 140
the fact of the matter is the iranians have stiffed the iaea for a decade about this. %$* 140
we have not stood firm on it. %$* 140
we have not forced them to come clean on their past program. %$* 140
and the agreement that we got from them about that is that, yes, they will address that question in the future. %$* 140
i’m willing to bet anything-- %$* 140
i’m going to make a prediction right here, phil. %$* 140
and my prediction is that if this deal is signed, we’re going to give them sanctions relief before they ever come clean on their past program, because they have never ever come clean and they’re not going to let us into military sites. %$* 140
tom pickering. %$* 13
look, let me offer you the facts, not your imagination, not your predictions-- %$* 335
have they ever come clean to the iaea? %$* 140
these are the facts-- %$* 335
have they ever come clean to the iaea? %$* 140
yes, of course they have. %$* 335
they’ve started. %$* 335
they’ve started. %$* 335
they’ve started. %$* 140
but that’s a step. %$* 335
but we will not-- %$* 335
you just said that. %$* 140
conclude the release of sanctions until they have come clean with the iaea.that’s an indisputable negotiating objective of the united states. %$* 335
that’s what we have said we will agree to, nothing less. %$* 335
and so that’s-- %$* 335
you’re sitting here making up fairy stories about what it is that’s going to be agreed or not agreed. %$* 335
nobody that i know of, when the framework came out on april 2nd, who knows anything about this agreement was not surprised by the degree to which iran had come in our directions, including, i have to tell you, a number of very senior iranians. %$* 335
the notion that somehow we have been snookered or somehow that this process will not work, totally defeats the fact that throughout the cold war we made a whole series of agreements with the soviet union. %$* 335
president reagan said in his best russian, “doveryai, no proveryai,” “trust but verify.” that’s the basis of this agreement. %$* 335
all right, let me-- %$* 13
this is nothing new here. %$* 335
mark dubowitz. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 336
tom, it’s interesting. %$* 336
i mean, you know, these are stories you tell children to keep the nightmares away, that, “don’t worry, the iranians will come clean. %$* 336
don’t worry, the iranians have come clean.” but, tom, you know better than anybody that the iranians have been stonewalling the iaea for years. %$* 336
there are 12 outstanding questions about past and possibly continuing military dimensions of the iranian program. %$* 336
the head of the iaea has made it very clear that he is deeply frustrated that iran refuses to answer those 12 questions. %$* 336
they’ve answered half of one, tom. %$* 336
half of one is not answering the questions. %$* 336
there are 11 and a half outstanding questions. %$* 336
we also know that the administration will give sanctions relief based on iranian nuclear compliance, and that includes centrifuges, it includes fordow, it includes some of the nuclear elements of this. %$* 336
so iran is going to get sanctions relief before they ever have to come clean on all 12 dimensions of the weaponization efforts-- %$* 336
just not accurate, mark. %$* 335
and you know what? %$* 336
phil. %$* 18
phil. %$* 18
they’ve already come on 8 according to the iaea, but let’s not argue about the details. %$* 335
12, tom, half of 12. %$* 336
let’s argue about the notion that they cannot get sanctions relief until they do. %$* 335
but, tom, they already have gotten sanctions relief. %$* 336
they’ve gotten $11.9 billion in oil escrow funds that have returned to them since november 2013.they’ve gotten petrochemical sanctions relief. %$* 336
they’ve gotten auto sanctions relief. %$* 336
their economy-- %$* 336
tom, their economy was on its back in 2013-- %$* 336
that’s in return for the joint program of action. %$* 335
but they came-- %$* 336
but they got sanctions relief before they ever came clean on weaponization, which completely contradicts your thesis. %$* 336
but that’s-- %$* 335
let me bring in phil gordon. %$* 13
well, they have gotten exceedingly modest sanctions relief, access to a small fraction of their money that has been frozen in foreign accounts, which you know very well the iranian economy is at least $500 billion or a trillion dollars. %$* 334
and getting access to 700 million of their own does not make a significant difference. %$* 334
the pmd point i think is the essential one. %$* 334
we agree with you that they haven’t yet come clean on pmd, and that they need to. %$* 334
what tom is saying is that there won’t be real sanctions relief until they do. %$* 334
now, you can assert that that’ll never happen, but i think we need to debate-- %$* 334
you know, the proposition on the table is “is this framework good for america? %$* 334
” you can attack some alternative version of the framework, but the one on the table is the one in which they have to come clean on pmd before they get to-- %$* 334
and so, here’s the problem. %$* 336
let’s-- %$* 13
because you’re getting the economics wrong here. %$* 336
mark, let’s hear from your partner, mike. %$* 13
let me shift it a little bit and just-- %$* 140
mike doran. %$* 13
say that, you know, tom said what i want is a fantasy. %$* 140
i want zero enrichment, zero reprocessing. %$* 140
that’s not what i want. %$* 140
what i want is an american side that will, a, behave like a great power, and b, not give the store away, that will use the leverage that it has to get the best kind of deal, the kind of deal that mark described. %$* 140
now, what %$* 140
what-- %$* 13
let me just-- %$* 13
why do you think that that hasn’t happened? %$* 13
what do you-- %$* 13
what if this actually is the best deal that they can get-- %$* 13
oh, no, no, no, no-- %$* 140
given the realities? %$* 13
no, no, no, no-- %$* 140
we-- %$* 140
listen. %$* 140
i have it from european partners to the negotiations that they have been shocked by the giveaway. %$* 140
the idea that we are responding, that we are responding to the demands of allies is simply not true. %$* 140
this has been a bilaterally negotiated deal. %$* 140
motivated by what? %$* 13
by the desire for detente with iran. %$* 140
the president has sold the world on the notion that he is-- %$* 140
that what he’s trying to do is get a nuclear arms agreement. %$* 140
what he is-- %$* 140
his strategic goal is to have detente with iran, and he’s using the arms control agreement as the vehicle-- %$* 140
so-- %$* 13
for getting it. %$* 140
the way that-- %$* 335
tom pickering. %$* 13
european allies-- %$* 335
the russians, the chinese, the brits, the french, and the germans have been with us. %$* 335
even with an-- %$* 335
not true. %$* 140
occasional protest from francais. %$* 335
not true. %$* 140
so, but it’s very true. %$* 335
every step of the way. %$* 335
not true. %$* 140
mike, wait. %$* 13
gentlemen, i-- %$* 13
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
hold it. %$* 13
let’s negotiate this. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
i do need to point out that when everybody’s talking over each other, that’s the section that absolutely gets cut from the podcast-- %$* 13
after about two seconds, for a little energy. %$* 13
but then we can’t hear what anybody’s saying. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
so, guys, stop talking-- %$* 140
let’s keep it going. %$* 13
over me. %$* 140
let-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
let phillip respond. %$* 13
so, then, i’m just puzzled. %$* 334
so, mike is sure that the british, and the french, and the germans, and the russians, and the chinese hate this agreement and think we’ve given away the store, but the foreign ministers of all those countries have endorsed it, and explained it, and defended it. %$* 334
that’s a tricky one for me. %$* 334
well, that-- %$* 140
the fact is-- %$* 140
i mean, that’s easy, phil. %$* 336
and you know this. %$* 336
the fact the matter of is is those countries don’t believe they can stop the obama runaway train to essentially surrender. %$* 336
i mean, the french have-- %$* 336
sure, the russians are totally compliant-- %$* 334
the european-- %$* 336
runaway train. %$* 334
the europeans have told me-- %$* 336
the europeans have told me their biggest nightmare, okay, is u.s.negotiators at one minute to midnight in a room with the iranian negotiators. %$* 336
and they believe at that point, major concessions come. %$* 336
and listen, major concessions have come, phil. %$* 336
the fact of the matter is iran’s economy was on its back in 2013 as a result of sanctions. %$* 336
as a result of sanctions relief that your administration-- %$* 336
that you were in-- %$* 336
negotiated, the economy is on its knees getting up to its feet. %$* 336
we’ve lost economic leverage. %$* 336
iran went from a severe recession to a modest recovery. %$* 336
when you lose peaceful economic leverage, you lose the ability to actually negotiate strong nuclear concessions. %$* 336
and when you lose peaceful economic leverage in a post-deal environment, you have no way to enforce this deal. %$* 336
and then you have to use military force to enforce this deal, which is something nobody at this table wants. %$* 336
phillip gordon. %$* 13
so, one percent-- %$* 335
so-- %$* 13
of their economy-- %$* 335
hold it. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
one percent changed their economy. %$* 335
hold-- %$* 13
tom, wait. %$* 13
i want to hear from phil. %$* 13
we agree on sanctions, mark, at least that part of it. %$* 334
that’s why they agreed to this deal that required them to do so many things that they didn’t want to do. %$* 334
you’re right. %$* 334
their economy is on its back. %$* 334
it’s because of the sanctions that we put together, together with our allies. %$* 334
and that’s how we got this deal. %$* 334
and then you diminish the pressure. %$* 336
mike doran. %$* 13
then you the negotiations-- %$* 336
mike-- %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
mark-- %$* 13
and diminish the pressure, and you gave on key nuclear demands, and that’s why-- %$* 336
mark-- %$* 13
we’re getting a sloppy-- %$* 336
mark, your partner is touching your elbow. %$* 13
that was out of affection. %$* 140
talk-- %$* 18
you on your-- %$* 18
mark was nice. %$* 140
mark toned down the story a little bit. %$* 140
the story that he heard was, “our nightmare”-- %$* 140
this is from our european allies. %$* 140
“our nightmare is that zarif and kerry are in a hotel room, and it’s one minute to midnight, and there’s a-- %$* 140
then there’s a deadline.” that’s what they said. %$* 140
now, the story that the obama administration told when it signed the interim agreement, is it said, “oh, the supreme leader is under such economic pressure, he’s dying for an agreement. %$* 140
what he needs from us is a face-saving agreement. %$* 140
a face-saving agreement. %$* 140
so, we’re going to rip up these security council resolutions, zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, and we are going to-- %$* 140
we are going to give him a face-saving nuclear enrichment program of 1,000 centrifuges.” and then i heard from our european allies, a little bit later the americans came and said, “it’s not going to be 1,000, it’s going to be 3,000.” a little bit later they came and said, “no, 4,500.” now it’s 6,104. and that’s why i can sit here and i can tell you, with absolute certainty, and i will be correct on this, there has been a pattern of concession, unilateral concession from the united states, and in forcing our partners along, and in the end-- %$* 140
okay. %$* 13
the iranians won’t come clean, and we’ll give them sanctions relief. %$* 336
going to tom, please. %$* 13
look, your predictions are your predictions. %$* 335
they have nothing to do with the framework. %$* 335
they have nothing to do with what we now have in hand, and they have nothing to do with what is now being currently negotiated as the final language of the agreement, which i am told is moving well. %$* 335
so if you want to believe the tooth fairy, if you want to believe the worst of all possible predictions, there’s your choice. %$* 335
but it’s not up on the board. %$* 335
you’re not voting for anything but the obama proposal at the present time or some alternative imaginary set of ideas. %$* 335
we constantly have asked, how is it that you would get done what it is you want to get done? %$* 335
and why is what you want to get done so much more worthwhile in the process of moving ahead? %$* 335
everybody knows they negotiated for a house here in this room. %$* 335
how many in this room have negotiated for a house? %$* 335
everybody knows your first bid is not the acceptable answer to what it is you get. %$* 335
it’s plain and simple. %$* 335
john, you gave away the house. %$* 336
almost everybody knows that. %$* 18
i bought john’s house, actually-- %$* 18
best deal of my life. %$* 18
the two guys over here didn’t raise their hands so-- %$* 18
mark dubowitz. %$* 13
mark dubowitz. %$* 13
well, here’s the problem. %$* 336
we have outlined a better deal. %$* 336
and one of the key elements of a better deal is that the restrictions of the obama administration of putting on this program are not going to expire after 15 years. %$* 336
i mean, 15 years. %$* 336
so let me ask how many of you are remember 9/11? %$* 336
9/11 was 14 years ago. %$* 336
how many of you have kids? %$* 336
all right, college senior was in first grade 15 years ago. %$* 336
and parents know that in geopolitics, as in life, 15 years is a blip in time. %$* 336
in 15 years, most of these restrictions are going to vanish. %$* 336
iran will have an industrial sized program. %$* 336
it’ll have zero breakout. %$* 336
zero breakout is undetectable breakout. %$* 336
tom, we can negotiate a better deal by making one simple modification to the obama deal. %$* 336
and that is that the restrictions will not sunset. %$* 336
they will not disappear until the international atomic energy agency has reached a broader conclusion that iran’s nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and there are no clandestine activities, which why not demand that? %$* 336
let’s take that to phil. %$* 13
i mean, i think that a lot of people in the audience would wonder is, what’s so great about a deal that gets iran to stop for 20 years and then they could start again? %$* 13
so what-- %$* 13
what’s supposed to happen after that? %$* 13
well, one thing that’s great about it is iran stops for 20 years. %$* 334
so you may not-- %$* 334
it may not be your ideal scenario. %$* 334
but if iran doesn’t stop for 20 years, then they start tomorrow. %$* 334
so that’s one thing about it. %$* 334
secondly, i keep coming back to this, and i’m sorry. %$* 334
you need a deal that you actually get and not one that you would, like i said earlier, write if you only had to write it yourself. %$* 334
we could have-- %$* 334
of course, mark, we could do that. %$* 334
we could go to the iranians now and say, “you’re currently in the doghouse because people don’t trust you. %$* 334
you violated security council resolutions, and that’s why we need these real commitments, binding commitments from you. %$* 334
but you know what? %$* 334
you’re going to be the doghouse forever. %$* 334
you have to accept uniquely-- %$* 334
you’re the only country in the world-- %$* 334
you have to accept these binding-- %$* 334
not for 20 years, not for 30 years, but for infinity.” i would submit to you we could do that and we would have a zero chance of getting an agreement, and then we’d be right back to what we’re talking about now. %$* 334
and so you won’t like the 20-year restrictions. %$* 334
you won’t have any restrictions and see if you like that much better. %$* 334
no, you’re mischaracterizing. %$* 336
the iaea could reach that broader conclusion in five years. %$* 336
they could reach it in seven years. %$* 336
all iran has to do is declare to the iaea that we have no clandestine facilities, we have no clandestine activities, and the iaea reaches a broader conclusion that it has done so with 60 countries, to say this is a peaceful program. %$* 336
so this is not about eternity. %$* 336
this is not about the tooth fairy. %$* 336
this is about a restriction-- %$* 336
but you’re-- %$* 334
you’re now for eternity. %$* 334
it could be five-- %$* 336
last point about it. %$* 334
phil, it could be five years. %$* 336
it could be seven years. %$* 336
no, no. %$* 334
if the agreement says-- %$* 334
peaceful nature of the program. %$* 336
okay, okay. %$* 13
this is what we’re going to do. %$* 13
peaceful. %$* 336
phil, peaceful. %$* 336
bringing out the bell. %$* 13
we’re going to calm things down, but to lighten things up at the same time, we’re going to continue for the next two minutes, but you each get 30 seconds. %$* 13
nobody else can talk during one side’s 30 seconds. %$* 13
when you hear the-- %$* 13
when you hear that bell, you have to stop, and the other side has to start. %$* 13
you’ll see the clock in front of you. %$* 13
i’m going to let it go to tom pickering or phil. %$* 13
who’d like to start? %$* 13
your 30 seconds starts now. %$* 13
the question, please, before they start my 30 seconds. %$* 335
what question-- %$* 335
oh, you were-- %$* 13
well, so you were responding to your opponent. %$* 13
well, one last point on sunset, about the 20 years. %$* 334
this is agreement doesn’t say, and we don’t believe, that as soon as the restriction is over, whether it’s 10 years on centrifuges or 20 years on something else, iran can do whatever it wants and get in a nuclear weapon. %$* 334
whenever these phases end, and in many cases, 15 and 25 years down the road, the u.s. president, the israeli prime minister, the leaders of the p5+1 will decide how they want to approach iran at that point. %$* 334
doesn’t mean they get a free pass. %$* 334
what it does mean is we get a couple of decades of peace until 2030, which is a lot better than not having it next week. %$* 334
you get-- %$* 140
you don’t-- %$* 140
mike doran. %$* 13
you don’t get a couple of decades. %$* 140
you don’t get 10 years, you don’t get 15 years. %$* 140
you have an agreement. %$* 140
you have a mafioso who’s going to sign an agreement, is going to say he’s going to abide by certain restrictions for 10 or 15 years. %$* 140
but all of the leverage that we have, other than military force, we are giving up on the front end of the-- %$* 140
on the front end of the deal. %$* 140
we’re paying them to sign this. %$* 140
we are paying to say that they will be good citizens for 10 or 15 years. %$* 140
and then you’re coming to me and saying that we’ve got this in hand. %$* 140
this is the way-- %$* 140
this is the iran that we’re going to be dealing with for the next 10 or 15 years is not the one that we’ve been dealing with for the last 35. %$* 140
pieces of this deal last forever, including the fact that iran is obligated not to do anything to move toward nuclear weapons. %$* 335
secondly, the additional inspection protocol stays on forever. %$* 335
so those are very important because they will signal to us plenty early as to whether the iranians are keeping their commitments or staying out of the nuclear weapons business as we go ahead. %$* 335
and it’s important that we have those to guarantee the process is moving ahead. %$* 335
and we have the force at the end of the day if they violate this agreement. %$* 335
mark. %$* 13
here’s the problem: if i’m iran, here’s what i do. %$* 336
i comply with the agreement for the first few years. %$* 336
i get my sanctions relief. %$* 336
i get the billions of dollars returned to me. %$* 336
i build my economy. %$* 336
i rebuild my economy. %$* 336
i create economic immunity against future economic pressure. %$* 336
i am a good boy for the first few years, and then i start to cheat. %$* 336
but i cheat incrementally, not egregiously, even the sum total of my incremental cheating will always be egregious if i’m an iranian regime. %$* 336
and i will then wait until those restrictions start to disappear, year 10, year 13, year 15, year 20. %$* 336
all right. %$* 13
hoo that felt so orderly. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
i want to go now to audience questions and to remind you, i’ll call on you. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you from the aisles. %$* 13
just wait till it gets to you. %$* 13
hold the mic about the distance from your mouth as a fist, as i am here. %$* 13
and please ask a question that’s relevant to-- %$* 13
to the motion that’s before us, that it relates to this iran deal. %$* 13
i would be interested if anybody has a question about an iran that is sanction free. %$* 13
is that such a great thing also, which is not part of the discussion we’ve gotten to very much. %$* 13
let’s go to some questions. %$* 13
right down front, sir. %$* 13
and a mic is coming down the aisle from your right. %$* 13
and if you could stand and tell us your first name, please. %$* 13
sure. %$* 337
thanks. %$* 337
thanks, john. %$* 337
my name is kayvon afshari. %$* 337
i’m the director of communications for the american iranian council. %$* 337
it’s an organization for which ambassador pickering serves as an honorary board member. %$* 337
and actually, that is what my question is about. %$* 337
so i want to leave aside your-- %$* 337
you’re not a plant as-- %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 337
i have a lot of respect for him but not at all. %$* 337
he’s our plant. %$* 18
well, actually, i want for the side what iran is conceding in this deal and focus on the sanctions relief that it will hypothetically receive. %$* 337
and i kind of want to ask two sides of this question, one for each side. %$* 337
so for the side in favor of the deal, do you see any veracity in the argument that, you know, an iran which has sanctions relief will be more aggressive regionally, you know, spend that money in yemen and syria. %$* 337
and for the other side, do you see the argument that an iran that has sanctions removed might, you know, through economic interdependence-- %$* 337
it’ll have kind of a moderating effect on its regional behavior. %$* 337
so is the sanction for iran basically good for america or bad for america by being good or bad for iran? %$* 13
let’s take it first to tom pickering. %$* 13
you want to take it? %$* 335
okay, phil gordon. %$* 13
yeah, sure. %$* 334
you’re recusing yourself. %$* 13
that’s very respectful. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 335
look, iran having access to its frozen funds is not something we would welcome. %$* 334
we’ve been very clear, the administration has been very clear that iran is a destabilizing factor in the region. %$* 334
it’s a state supporter of terrorism, and we don’t want to see the iranian regime have more money at its disposable to pursue some of these activities. %$* 334
but as tom reminded the group earlier on, this is a nuclear agreement. %$* 334
the reason these specific sanctions are in place-- %$* 334
the only reason we got the rest of the world to join these sanctions-- %$* 334
and, by the way, it was only when the rest of the world joined them that they became effective-- %$* 334
is that they were focused on iran’s nuclear weapons program. %$* 334
now, it seems to me what our opponents are suggesting here, or those who don’t want to move ahead with this deal, is that we focused it on the nuclear program to get international support for the sanctions, we brought down the iranian economy, and then in the 11th hour we say, “oh, by the way, even though we’ve gotten what we want on the nuclear side, let’s keep on the sanctions because we actually now want iran to stop supporting terrorism, recognize israel, stop messing around in yemen-- %$* 334
” and, let me just be clear, i’m for all of those things. %$* 334
we should be vigorously trying to pursue all of those goals, but the idea that we can just shift gears and say, “we’re not even doing the deal until then,” is a recipe not for getting both a nuclear deal and constraining iran in the region, it’s a recipe for getting neither. %$* 334
mike doran. %$* 13
this deal isn’t a deal about nuclear weapons, but it has profound implications for iran’s place in the world. %$* 140
it has profound implications for iran’s ability to make mischief around the region. %$* 140
phil says he and the obama administration would say as well that they are for doing something about the iranian backed militias in iraq, they’re for stopping hezbollah from turning south lebanon into an armed camp. %$* 140
hezbollah has 100,000 missiles and rockets that can-- %$* 140
that could hit israel-- %$* 140
what are they doing about it? %$* 140
they’re not doing anything about it. %$* 140
all of the region, everyone in the region, all of our allies are up in arms, hair on fire about this issue, and the answer is, “look, it’s just a nuclear agreement.” the only way this agreement makes sense, is what kayvon asked here, is if the obama administration believes that if it kisses the frog it will turn into a prince, that through this economic-- %$* 140
through the economic transformation of iran, through greater relief of sanctions and greater business opportunities iran is going to miraculously transform into something other than what we know it to be. %$* 140
well, that actually was the second part of the question. %$* 13
what of that proposition? %$* 13
the iranian regime has-- %$* 140
the revolutionary guard corps has set up front companies that dominate the economy of iran. %$* 140
they have positioned themselves very well to benefit from this. %$* 140
what we are doing, like i said, is making a deal with the mafia and assuming that it will become a legitimate businessman. %$* 140
there’s no reason to believe that. %$* 140
maybe, maybe it could possibly happen, but it is wishful thinking. %$* 140
it is definitely tooth fairy thinking. %$* 140
is it at the core-- %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
is it in any way at the core of the thinking on the agreement that iran in 10 to 20 years may be nicer than it is today? %$* 13
i think it’s clear that they will be deeply invested in being part of the international community from which they have been excluded. %$* 335
so there is no question that at least one possibility is that they will behave and not move toward a nuclear weapon. %$* 335
the other possibility is we will certainly, as i pointed out a minute ago, know if they do. %$* 335
and we will have exactly the same retributive capabilities then as we have now. %$* 335
and in my view that is the arrangement that makes the most sense and the best deal that we have been able to get up until now, and our friends have shown us absolutely no way to improve the deal. %$* 335
i would love to find ways to improve the deal, but i am totally satisfied that the deal we have now on the table is a deal which we can certainly live with and that we will have every opportunity to assure that iran does not get a nuclear weapon. %$* 335
okay, tom, one second-- %$* 13
tom, i just got to note that the next time you don’t need to actually look to me, and when you turn you lost the mike. %$* 13
so you got-- %$* 13
you can all speak out when you’re speaking. %$* 13
but take it to mark. %$* 13
all right, john, thank you. %$* 336
look, tom is actually putting his finger on their case. %$* 336
their case is of an economic seduction case, not economic coercion. %$* 336
we’re going to seduce the hard men of this regime, and in 15 years they are going to be integrated in the global economy. %$* 336
and by being integrated they’re going to be moderate and pragmatic, because that’s the only way this deal makes sense, because all those restrictions are going to go away in 15 years. %$* 336
now, tom and phil have both said, “we will have the same coercive power in 15 years that we have today.” it took decades to build up the sanctions regime. %$* 336
it took decades to change the political calculus of the hard men of iran to get to the table to start negotiating seriously. %$* 336
you don’t snap back sanctions overnight. %$* 336
in fact, it takes decades to reconstitute them. %$* 336
and, as i said before, we’re snapping back sanctions not just against the russians and the chinese, we’re going to be snapping them back against the europeans. %$* 336
we’re going back into iran and investing tens of billions of dollars back into the iranian energy sector and the financial sector. %$* 336
we will not have the same coercive instruments in 10 to 15 years. %$* 336
we will have military force as an answer to iranian cheating or challenging of the iaea.and if economic seduction doesn’t work, phil, if economic seduction doesn’t work, tom, it’s the same regime in power. %$* 336
and this is not king wilhelm alexander of holland. %$* 336
all right? %$* 336
this is ali khamenei of iran. %$* 336
and he’s a hard man. %$* 336
and these are the revolutionary guards. %$* 336
and they are hard men. %$* 336
they cannot be economically seduced. %$* 336
sir, if you could stand up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
my name is gibran i wanted to address a question to the side arguing for the motion. %$* 18
your opposition made a point about whether this deal is good for america or not, how it’s perceived in the region, with our allies, saudi arabia and israel, they’re very unhappy with that. %$* 18
how is that going to influence the direction that it goes? %$* 18
let me just-- %$* 335
tom pickering. %$* 13
say the following, that before the november 24th preliminary agreement was even reached, prime minister netanyahu said it was the worst of all possible agreements ever negotiated. %$* 335
within a year, he was back to us, pleading with us to accept this agreement as the “forever document” in the process of moving ahead. %$* 335
he said the same thing about the comprehensive framework before it appeared. %$* 335
now that it is appeared, i hear nothing from prime minister netanyahu further about the arrangement. %$* 335
there is no other alternative in my view that is achievable, that has the capacity to stop the iranians from making a nuclear weapon. %$* 335
and my view is at this stage, that the allies may be jealous of the fact-- %$* 335
which is purely imaginary-- %$* 335
that somehow, iran is going to emerge as some kind of new hegemon in the middle east. %$* 335
the president, i’m sure, made it clear to them at the camp david summit, that was the farthest thing from his mind. %$* 335
but it is important, in fact, that we deal with realities and not with the kind of imagination that sits across the table from us. %$* 335
would your side like a response on that? %$* 13
they’re not-- %$* 140
mike doran-- %$* 13
the allies are not upset about imaginary things. %$* 140
they allies are upset about militias that the iranians are running inside iraq, and that the united states is cooperating with indirectly in fighting the islamic state. %$* 140
our airpower comes in, and knocked out the islamic state of ramadi, and the shiite militias controlled by tehran took it over. %$* 140
in israel, now, we have iranian forces-- %$* 140
not just hezbollah, but actually iranian forces across the border from israel in syria. %$* 140
we’ve got an iranian proxy, hezbollah, on israel’s northern border. %$* 140
we’ve got an israeli proxy, hamas, in gaza. %$* 140
we’ve got iranians on the-- %$* 140
you meant hamas as an iranian proxy. %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
hamas is an iranian proxy. %$* 140
yeah. %$* 13
you referred to israelis-- %$* 13
it’s a-- %$* 140
it’s-- %$* 140
hamas is not as closely controlled as hezbollah is by tehran, but the military wing of hamas is armed and equipped by the iranians. %$* 140
so, the israelis are now surrounded by iranian power. %$* 140
and when you-- %$* 140
when the israelis or the-- %$* 140
and the saudis see the iranians in yemen, when the saudis and the israelis go to the americans and they say, “what’s your answer to this? %$* 140
the rise of iran across the region,” the-- %$* 140
what they get is rhetoric. %$* 140
they get president obama saying, “we’re concerned about that. %$* 140
we’ve got your back. %$* 140
we’ll help you.”they say to the saudis, “we’re going to help you with your intraoperative missile defense, and we’re going to give you some other capabilities against conventional threat, which doesn’t even address the issue at all. %$* 140
might i have a word on that? %$* 334
yes. %$* 13
please do. %$* 13
and then i’m going to go ahead. %$* 13
just to remind people, the proposition on the table is whether this deal is good for america. %$* 334
now, a lot of our allies in the region and elsewhere have real concerns about iran, and so do we. %$* 334
and we stand with them on that. %$* 334
but a lot of our allies in the region would not mind if we went to war against iran. %$* 334

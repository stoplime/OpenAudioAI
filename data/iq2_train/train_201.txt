all right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to begin, and i want to ask you to welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
now i'd like to introduce the chairman of the board of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you all very much for being here, and i want to just start by thanking aspen institute, especially kitty boone and walter isaacson for inviting intelligence squared to participate in the ideas festival. %$* 1
we've been broadcasting these debates monthly on national public radio for six years, mostly from new york, with occasional debates in d.c.and chicago, and it's very special for us to be here in aspen. %$* 1
we believe that debate remains one of the best vehicles we have, not only for promulgating ideas, but for testing those ideas with rigor. %$* 1
and we enjoy proving that debate is not a lost art. %$* 1
we think you'll find it special to see how debate can raise the level of public discourse in an engaging and competitive format. %$* 1
my role this evening is to frame the debate. %$* 1
"why is this subject important? %$* 1
what are the principal arguments on each side? %$* 1
" hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is used to extract natural gas locked up in shale rock. %$* 1
the process involves pumping millions of gallons of water and tons of chemicals under very high pressure into rock formations nearly two miles under the earth's surface. %$* 1
the environmental concerns are obvious. %$* 1
accidents can happen anywhere along the line, especially during pumping operations or in disposing of wastes. %$* 1
aquifers can be contaminated by methane and fracking fluids. %$* 1
some highly toxic chemicals might percolate into groundwater. %$* 1
large quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, might be emitted. %$* 1
there's even concern that fracking might induce earthquakes. %$* 1
would you trust the oil industry to take proper precautions? %$* 1
how can they justify taking these kind of environmental risks? %$* 1
well, what are the counterarguments? %$* 1
put simply, cheap and abundant natural gas is viagra for the limp u.s.economy. %$* 1
shale already provides nearly a quarter of our natural gas. %$* 1
it's projected to support 870,000 jobs by 2015.by reducing electric bills, it will put more than $900 a year in the pockets of the average household. %$* 1
the geopolitical benefits are equally dramatic. %$* 1
by reducing oil imports and pressuring oil prices down, we reduce the power and leverage of such oil exporting troublemakers, as venezuela and russia, saudi arabia and iran. %$* 1
there's also a strong environmental argument in favor. %$* 1
the real world choice is burning gas and burning coal. %$* 1
per unit of energy, coal creates twice the carbon emissions as gas does. %$* 1
the u.s.has reduced its carbon emissions far more than europe has done, and natural gas is the reason. %$* 1
tonight's debate is about the inevitable trade-offs between risks and rewards. %$* 1
clearly, the risks are real and it is reasonable to be concerned about them. %$* 1
but the benefits are real, too. %$* 1
which argument should prevail? %$* 1
it's up to you to decide. %$* 1
and to help you do that, we've assembled an outstanding panel of experts. %$* 1
it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
and i'd just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz, and for the american clean skies foundation for underwriting this event, and for the aspen institute. %$* 13
for all of them, a round of applause. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so, what if you could take a volcano and turn it upside down so that instead of that huge explosion going up into the sky, it goes down into the earth, and once it's down there, it releases this huge ocean of energy that could heat our homes for decades to come? %$* 13
wouldn't that be great? %$* 13
or would it? %$* 13
i'm john donvan of intelligence squared u.s. get ready for a debate-- %$* 13
not on the upside-down volcano-- %$* 13
because it is a metaphor, a flawed one. %$* 13
it does not exist-- %$* 13
but on the principle of technologies that works in a similar way. %$* 13
it is called “fracking.” and it is a debate because fracking actually is getting at an enormous amount of natural gas energy that this nation does need. %$* 13
but at the same time, it is feared that fracking could be having enormous and terrible toxic consequences, destructive to the environment and destructive to the communities. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two against two-- %$* 13
who will be arguing for and against this specific motion-- %$* 13
no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
our debate will go in three rounds. %$* 13
then, the audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion: deborah goldberg, a managing attorney with the environmental law firm earthjustice. %$* 13
her partner is katherine hudson. %$* 13
she is the watershed program director of riverkeeper, a clean water advocacy group based in new york. %$* 13
on the side against, joe nocera. %$* 13
he is an award-winning journalist and op-ed columnist for “the new york times.” and his partner, susan tierney, a former assistant secretary for policy in the u.s.department of energy. %$* 13
now going to re-introduce everyone, because what we just did was for our television broadcast. %$* 13
now, we're going to do a little bit for our radio podcast. %$* 13
and i appreciate the applause. %$* 13
it's very, very good for our transitions, so thank you. %$* 13
and if you don't applaud at one point, i'll raise my hand. %$* 13
that's me saying, “please applaud again.” our motion is-- %$* 13
no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
let's meet our debators and welcome first deborah goldberg. %$* 13
deborah is a managing attorney at earthjustice, the world's first and largest non-profit environmental law firm. %$* 13
deborah, you've worn many different hats. %$* 13
but now that you're in this field, i understand the way you came through-- %$* 13
it had something to do with birds. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 537
my love for birds is what woke me up to the risks that climate change poses for bio-diversity. %$* 537
and i got involved in fracking because we’re not going to be able to deal with climate change unless we end our addiction to fossil fuels. %$* 537
all right. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
your partner is katherine hudson. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, katherine hudson. %$* 13
katherine, you are an avid outdoors woman. %$* 13
you ski, you rock-climb, you sail on the hudson river. %$* 13
you spent nearly 25 years in new york state government, working in the environmental protection bureau of the attorney general's office and also the departmental of environmental conservation. %$* 13
so, it sounds like you've been in this all of your life. %$* 13
but at one time, you were actually a probation officer? %$* 13
that's right. %$* 538
it was a bit of an unusual start for me. %$* 538
but i found myself working as a probation officer in new brunswick, new jersey. %$* 538
and it is actually what pushed me to go to law school, because i realized that i wanted to be part of the system-- %$* 538
i thought i could make a difference if i was-- %$* 538
and not on the receiving end of the system. %$* 538
thank you very much, kate hudson. %$* 13
our motion is no fracking way: the natural gas movement is doing more harm than good, and here is, arguing against the motion first, joe nocera. %$* 13
joe, you are an award-winning journalist working for the new york times now with the op-ed page after writing for them for a long time. %$* 13
in april of 2011, you went to the op- ed page and since then some of your columns on energy have brought down fire upon your head. %$* 13
you've been referred to by climate progress as a member of the climate ignorati. %$* 13
yes i have. %$* 539
you've been denounced by robert redford. %$* 13
yes i have. %$* 539
so, did you see all of this coming your way when you took this stance? %$* 13
you know, when i first started writing about energy issues in the op-ed page i was surprised-- %$* 539
i was not surprised that people were disagreeing with me. %$* 539
i kind of expected that. %$* 539
but i was surprised by the vehemence of it. %$* 539
the only time i've ever been accosted in a grocery store for a column i wrote was after one of my fracking columns. %$* 539
all right. %$* 13
we'll see what happens here tonight. %$* 13
let's meet your partner. %$* 13
also arguing that the natural gas boom has been a good thing for the country is susan tierney. %$* 13
she is the managing principal at analysis group, where she consults on energy, economics, and environmental issues. %$* 13
she has been in government for the state of massachusetts and was also an assistant secretary for policy at the u.s. department of energy during the clinton administration, and you-- %$* 13
interesting thing, you were an art history major. %$* 13
yes. %$* 540
so are the art historians doomed if they're all going into energy? %$* 13
or do you still believe? %$* 13
what it means is that i was a pretty mediocre artist and so then i thought well, art history, that's kind of right, and then i was a pretty mediocre art historian, so i did whatever anybody in that circumstance would do. %$* 540
i became a policy wonk. %$* 540
i hear from your brother you're a good debater. %$* 13
only because we did it around the breakfast table. %$* 540
all right. %$* 13
we'll find out more. %$* 13
so, our motion is this. %$* 13
no fracking way. %$* 13
the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
you our live audience will choose our winners by voting on that motion, both before the debate, and once again when the debate is completed. %$* 13
so let's go to the first vote. %$* 13
there's a keypad at your seat on the right-hand side. %$* 13
this is a tricky motion because if you're for the motion you're against fracking and i want that to be clear to you. %$* 13
you've heard where they're coming from. %$* 13
if you're for this side, if you're for this side, if you're for the motion, no fracking way, press number one. %$* 13
if you are with this side, against no fracking way, it means you support fracking, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you made a mistake just correct it. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and what we'll do is we're going to hold that result for you. %$* 13
does the buzz buzz mean that you're confused? %$* 13
are there any questions? %$* 13
no? %$* 13
everybody's good? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so what we're going to do at the end of the debate, we'll reveal both of the numbers and the team whose numbers have changed the most in the course of the evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, onto round one. %$* 13
our motion is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good and here to speak first for the motion, kate hudson. %$* 13
she spent nearly 25 years in new york state government serving in the attorney general's office and in the department of environmental conservation. %$* 13
she is now the watershed program director at riverkeeper, a member-supported clean water advocacy group. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, kate hudson. %$* 13
the motion before us tonight is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 538
yes, the gas boom is doing more harm than good, but why? %$* 538
what is going on? %$* 538
simply, the gas companies are rushing forward in the face of too many unknowns and too little control. %$* 538
in essence, these companies are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment, which is resulting in extreme and, in some cases, permanent harm to people, communities, and the environment that cannot be compensated for by any possible benefits. %$* 538
what my partner, deborah goldberg, and i will be talking with you about tonight is what those harms are that are being faced across the country because of the natural gas boom: the health risks for individuals, the impacts to the environment, and the costs for local communities. %$* 538
and why, in the face of the unknown, in the face of the harms, gas companies are so intent on rushing forward hoping to figure it out along the way. %$* 538
well, what exactly is fracking? %$* 538
deborah and i use the term fracking to refer to the entire cradle-to-grave process of natural gas extraction, from site preparation through transmission to end uses. %$* 538
the process begins with cutting access roads through the existing landscape and stripping a site about the size of five football fields to serve as a multi-well pad. %$* 538
then the drilling rig will arrive, along with thousands of truckloads of equipment, water, sand, and chemicals that will be used to drill thousands of feet into the ground and miles horizontally. %$* 538
this is followed by the actual fracturing of the well which involves repeatedly, for a month or more, forcing two to eight million gallons of water and hundreds of undisclosed chemicals underground, under pressure, to fracture the rock, allowing the gas to escape. %$* 538
then something must be done with the large quantity of contaminated wastewater, up to several million gallons per well, that will come back up along with the methane now released from the shale. %$* 538
if not properly handled, the methane may find its way into nearby drinking water wells. %$* 538
it may also be released into the air either intentionally or as a result of leaks. %$* 538
the methane gas that is captured is then processed and forced through gathering lines and into high pressure pipelines that will need to be constructed from numerous wellheads for hundreds and thousands of miles to the place where the gas will be burned, permanently carving up the landscape and communities that lie in between. %$* 538
to give you a clearer idea of how this fracking process is impacting people and communities, imagine that you'd go home tonight and find out that your next-door neighbor has signed a lease with a gas drilling company without asking you. %$* 538
what can you expect from this industrial activity going on next door? %$* 538
even though you didn't choose to lease, you will be exposed to the same risks of contamination to the water you drink and the air you breathe as your neighbor. %$* 538
you will be subject to the same threat of leaks and spills of the fracking wastewater, which contain known carcinogens and radioactive material. %$* 538
fracking-related spills occur on average once every three days in colorado. %$* 538
moreover, the industry has no safe disposal plans for this waste. %$* 538
much of it is currently injected into underground wells, but this practice has been linked to earthquakes, and there's growing evidence that these wells are leaking. %$* 538
the gas well itself, and associated processing compression in storage tanks, will leak toxic and smog- forming air pollutants. %$* 538
the once pristine air in fracked parts of wyoming is now worse than the air in los angeles because of this. %$* 538
the few studies we do have show increased risks of cancer and respiratory diseases in gas land communities linked to these releases. %$* 538
like your leasing neighbor, you will be unable to escape noise that can sound-- %$* 538
the constant day and night truck traffic, estimated by new york state at 4,000 truck trips per well. %$* 538
there will be 24/7 noise that can sound like a jet engine, and glaring lights all night long during the drilling and fracturing of the well over the next month or more. %$* 538
you will also potentially have gas pipelines cross your property whether you agree to it or not, and you will be subject to the same increase in your taxes as your drilling neighbor when your town has to repair the road damage caused by the heavy truck traffic that comes with fracking that will tear apart your rural and suburban streets, and when your town has to meet the increased demands for community services from transient drill crews. %$* 538
proponents argue that the economic benefits outweigh these risks so far. %$* 538
but what are the supposed benefits of this industrial activity almost literally in your backyard, or down the street from your children's pool? %$* 538
the economic benefits for you will be limited. %$* 538
there will be access to cheap natural gas at least for a little while, but it won't last for very long because the amount that can be forced out of the earth is limited and will run out. %$* 538
but even more important, it will not remain cheap, because the industry will be doing everything it can to increase the price of gas, including exporting america's gas to other countries where they can triple-- %$* 538
yes, triple the price-- %$* 538
on the u.s.market today. %$* 538
the drilling will bring jobs, at least while the drill rigs are in town, but not very many and not for long, and these gas industry jobs are some of the most life- threatening in the country. %$* 538
oil and gas workers are seven times more likely to die on the job than the national average. %$* 538
and fracking can destroy businesses that could sustain local economies into the future after the fracking boom is over, like agriculture, recreation, and tourism. %$* 538
what is clear is that gas companies are not willing to wait. %$* 538
the natural gas boom is moving forward as a large uncontrolled experiment with every individual, family, and community who has not signed a lease being forced to participate without their consent. %$* 538
whatever transitory benefits fracking may provide is outweighed by all of the harms that it currently brings. %$* 538
but even more important, there are some harms that simply cannot be compensated for. %$* 538
if you can no longer live in your home or continue to work your family farm, if you lose your health, the health of your child, if you lose your life as hundreds of oil and gas workers have. %$* 538
if you lose access to drinkable water or breathable air as individuals in communities across the fracking states have, there is no good that can outweigh such harm. %$* 538
until we have a much better understanding of the processes and the true risks, until there are mandatory rules in place to control these risks and eliminate the extreme harm, and until the industry actually follows those rules, the only defensible course of action is a cautious one. %$* 538
the only reasonable and fair answer is, "no, no fracking way." %$* 538
thank you, kate hudson. %$* 13
our motion is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good, and now here to speak against the motion is joe nocera, he is an op-ed columnist for the new york times and a regular business commentator on npr's "weekend edition saturday," an award winning journalist, and a bestselling author. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, joe nocera. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 539
in kate's opening statement, there's one word that she didn't use, and that word is "coal."we're going to use that word a lot on our side of the ledger tonight, because part of the case for natural gas is it's the best single way to diminish our use of coal. %$* 539
and coal is without question the most environmentally hazardous fuel that we have in america. %$* 539
you know, fred krupp from the environmental defense fund was in aspen not very long ago, and he did a panel on fracking, and he said, you know, "i'm a realist. %$* 539
i'm also an environmentalist. %$* 539
fracking is here, and we have to regulate it.” it's not that impossible. %$* 539
we regulate banks. %$* 539
we regulate children's toys. %$* 539
we regulate automobiles. %$* 539
we do regulate banks, actually. %$* 539
but when it comes to gas, we are in the golden age of gas, that's what we're in. %$* 539
it's not like we have a little bit of gas that we're busy trying to extract here and there, and it's going to run out tomorrow. %$* 539
we have something on the order of 2,000 trillion cubic feet of gas. %$* 539
we use about 24 trillion cubic feet a year. %$* 539
so, we have about an 80 to 100-year supply right now. %$* 539
that means, among other things, that gas is incredibly cheap. %$* 539
right now it's in the two-dollar range. %$* 539
it probably-- %$* 539
yes, it probably will go up to the four or five-dollar range, which still makes it much cheaper than most other fuels and makes it very competitive with coal. %$* 539
gas has-- %$* 539
cheap energy is an enormous boon for the country, just cheap energy across the board. %$* 539
it increases our gdp.it has enormous ramifications well beyond jobs. %$* 539
natural gas also has the ability to be a transformative fuel and a bridge fuel as we think about moving to renewal. %$* 539
excuse me, one second. %$* 539
so the economic benefit is one kind of benefit. %$* 539
a second kind of benefit obviously is the energy security benefit. %$* 539
i'm going to read something from the wall street journal that ran just a few days ago. %$* 539
"america will halve its reliance on middle east oil by the end of this decade and could be completely rid of it by 2035 due to the declining demand and the rapid growth of new petroleum sources in the western hemisphere. %$* 539
shale rock is one of those sources." now, who made this projection? %$* 539
it was opec itself. %$* 539
think about a world where you don't have to worry about cartels, you don't have to worry about being dependent on our enemies for oil, a world where foreign policy is not dictated by our need for oil. %$* 539
the ability of the united states to have its own resource once again in a way that we never thought we were going to is a tremendous gift that's been handed to us, and fracking is the way that we're taking advantage of it. %$* 539
now, the third aspect that i want to talk about is the environmental benefits, which is real and which is happening now. %$* 539
as recently as 2009, 45 percent of the power generation in the country was coal, 23 percent was natural gas. %$* 539
today, it's about evenly split. %$* 539
there is a rush to natural gas and away from coal. %$* 539
this is a great thing for the country. %$* 539
natural gas has half the co2 emissions than coal, 90-- %$* 539
coal has 90 times more sulfur dioxide, five times more nitrogen oxide. %$* 539
coal is the dirtiest fuel we have. %$* 539
and so, if facilities could switch to natural gas, it has the potential to transform the country. %$* 539
you know, in europe, where they like to think of themselves as extremely environmentally sensitive, their emissions are actually going up because they're building more coal fire power plants. %$* 539
in america, our emissions are flat and going slightly down, according to studies. %$* 539
and a large part of the reason is because we're having this rush to natural gas. %$* 539
the same is also true of china, of mexico, of russia, and of a handful of other countries that are relying on other sources than gas. %$* 539
we have-- %$* 539
what we actually have is a minute and 31 seconds. %$* 539
oh, i am? %$* 539
i have actually made my case. %$* 539
i'm good. %$* 539
i don't need seven minutes. %$* 539
you're going to get 20 seconds more for the water drink. %$* 13
oh, i am? %$* 539
yes, joe. %$* 13
go give him the water. %$* 13
it's clean water. %$* 13
i have actually made my case. %$* 539
you're good? %$* 13
i'm good. %$* 539
all right. %$* 13
i don't need seven minutes. %$* 539
drink water. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
joe nocera. %$* 13
so, a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i am john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters-- %$* 13
two against two-- %$* 13
fighting it out against this motion: no fracking way: the natural gas movement is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
you have heard from the first two debaters. %$* 13
now, onto the third. %$* 13
deborah goldberg is a managing attorney at earthjustice, an environmental law firm that provides legal representation at no cost to more than a thousand clients, ranging from large national groups like the national resources defense council, to small community coalitions. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, deborah goldberg. %$* 13
to start, i'd like to bring the focus back to the motion that we've been asked to debate. %$* 537
we aren't here tonight to decide whether or not fracking is a gift or if it's a trojan horse. %$* 537
we are here to decide whether or not the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 537
so, what characterizes a boom? %$* 537
it's big. %$* 537
it's sudden. %$* 537
and it blows a lot of smoke. %$* 537
and the natural gas boom is doing all of that to an extreme. %$* 537
it's too much. %$* 537
it's too fast. %$* 537
and the hype is just over the top. %$* 537
so, why do i say that it's too much? %$* 537
the most serious health and environmental impacts of fracking are largely due to very intensive gas development. %$* 537
we have 500,000 gas wells in this country, nearly 3,000 in one county, 11 compressor stations belching carcinogenic air emissions in a tiny town of only two square miles. %$* 537
our bodies and our ecosystems can absorb a certain amount of abuse and still bounce back. %$* 537
but at a certain point, it's just too much, and the insults overwhelm the resilience. %$* 537
take pennsylvania, for example. %$* 537
in the beginning, pennsylvania was letting the frackers take their wastewater, which is contaminated with very high levels of salt, to sewage treatment plants, where it was diluted with the sewage, and then discharged into rivers and streams. %$* 537
in short order we had a water quality violation in the drinking water supply for 350,000 people. %$* 537
and what's more, pennsylvania realized that if they continued to let the frackers take that amount of wastage through its treatment plants, they would salinate every freshwater stream in the state in a period of two years. %$* 537
the same dynamic operates on a global level. %$* 537
our atmosphere can absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions. %$* 537
but if we release too much, the climate warms to a point of catastrophic change. %$* 537
and the natural gas boom is taking us to that tipping point, because the way that fracking is done now releases very large amounts of methane into the air. %$* 537
and methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, almost 72 times as potent as carbon dioxide, depending on the time frame that you look at. %$* 537
a recent study showed that the leakage from fracking is about four percent of production and the scientists recognized that at that level gas loses its entire climate advantage over coal when it's burned for electrical power. %$* 537
the intensive development isn't really even good for the industry. %$* 537
right now the industry is losing money on every dry gas well that's drilled. %$* 537
but it's even worse for solar, wind, and other clean energy sources, because they are displaced when the price of natural gas drops so low. %$* 537
the boom is not only too big, but it's way too fast. %$* 537
it is out ahead of the science. %$* 537
we do know as a result of lots of public pressure that some of the chemicals that are used in this process are toxic, but there are many chemicals that have never even been tested as to their toxicity, and we have no clue what they're going to do to our health or environment, in the short or the long term. %$* 537
we don't know where the wastewater that stays down below-- %$* 537
and that can be as much as 90 percent of the waste water in the northeastern shale-- %$* 537
is going to migrate in 20, 30 years or more. %$* 537
the development is also way ahead of the protections that we have. %$* 537
instead of doing science and getting the safeguards before we move forward, we are flooring the accelerator and we're responding to crises. %$* 537
when you move too fast you cut corners and you have accidents, and that's particularly troublesome when you're talking about climate change, because the single most important factor for the social and environmental impact of climate change is the speed at which it progresses. %$* 537
we move too fast with climate change and we don't have time to prepare or to adapt, and so the climate scientists are telling us that we have to address the most potent greenhouse gases right now as fast as we can, and on that list is methane. %$* 537
the hype and the hoopla is clouding our vision and making it impossible for us to hear the facts. %$* 537
there are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ensure that this industry can continue to operate without the science and without the protections we need. %$* 537
$320 million spent on lobbying the federal government in just two years. %$* 537
as a result, what we are hearing now is not how we're going to end our addiction to fossil fuels, but instead, a hundred years of gas. %$* 537
now, a hundred years of gas is based on extracting every molecule of gas from all of our reserves, even those that we haven't actually discovered yet, when it is well known that only about 10 percent of those reserves tend to be economically feasible to develop. %$* 537
and if we switch our power plants over to gas and our transportation systems over to gas, and our heating and cooking systems, and then on top of that we export liquid natural gas to other countries, how long is that abundant resource going to last? %$* 537
and at what price to our health and environment? %$* 537
the boom mentality produces magical thinking. %$* 537
the idea that this industry is going voluntarily to abide by a golden rule or a golden age of gas is just a fairy tale. %$* 537
this industry fights every protection we try to put in place, federal and state, often when it's even in its economic interests to comply. %$* 537
what all this means is that we are in the middle of an uncontrolled experiment. %$* 537
if we get this wrong, there is no turning back. %$* 537
and so we need to take the opportunity now when, we have a glut and we are not desperate for gas, to do the science and get the protections in place before it's too late and the natural gas boom that looks so exciting now goes bust in the face of the next generation. %$* 537
thank you, deborah goldberg. %$* 13
our motion is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
and now our final debater speaking against this motion, sue tierney. %$* 13
sue is a managing principal at analysis group, where she consults to businesses, government agencies, nongovernment organizations. %$* 13
she's a former assistant secretary for policy at the u.s.department of energy, and is a current member of the secretary of energy's advisory board. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, sue tierney. %$* 13
good evening, everybody. %$* 540
joe told you about the upsides of the natural gas boom, and deborah and kate told you about some of the risks. %$* 540
i just want to start by saying if it were only as simple as my opponents tell you, then life would be pretty easy. %$* 540
let me tell you why their position, that the costs of developing natural gas are simply not worth the benefits, is wrong. %$* 540
first, what they didn't tell you is that there is absolutely nobody in the united states, no entity, that could actually introduce this proposition and make it so. %$* 540
there are hundreds of millions of decision makers in our energy system. %$* 540
if we rely on a regulated market, consumers and suppliers all around the country, every one of you is making energy choices every day, they don't have the authority to completely stop this, no single state could stop this, nor could the federal government. %$* 540
on the consumer side, americans tend not to think very much about energy. %$* 540
what they think about is getting to their job or getting to the shop where they hope to find lots of options, whether they can power their computers, or keep their homes warm or cool, and it's those realities that people don't think about energy that much. %$* 540
that makes this a really hard issue to deal with. %$* 540
everybody wants energy 24/7.they want it pretty cheap. %$* 540
many say they'd like it to be clean, and many really suffer when prices go up. %$* 540
that's the reality, and that makes this issue very gray and not as black and white as my opponents would tell you. %$* 540
deborah and kate have set up in some sense a false dichotomy. %$* 540
they make it seem as though natural gas is evil and so everything else is pure. %$* 540
we know that that's not the case. %$* 540
surely we should be developing more wind and solar power. %$* 540
i'm sure everyone in this audience agrees with that. %$* 540
right now, seven percent of america's energy supply comes from renewable energy; most of that is from the roosevelt-era hydroelectric facilities, those gigantic projects, none of which we would be able to build again for environmental impact reasons. %$* 540
the other major portion of renewables right now comes from biofuels such as ethanol, with its own problems from an environmental impact point of view. %$* 540
wind and solar are expected to grow, but even if they're 10 times as much as they are today, we're still talking about a long way to go and a small portion of the supply, and i hope we get there. %$* 540
it's very hard. %$* 540
but these and every other energy choice are really pretty hard and very complicated. %$* 540
why else would japan be restarting its nuclear plants so soon after the fukushima disaster? %$* 540
it's because they need energy. %$* 540
why else would pennsylvania be opening up its shale gas resources for development? %$* 540
they'd like some jobs and economic benefits associated with it. %$* 540
and, in fact, why are coal states fighting so hard against the u.s. epa air toxics rules that would reduce the amount of coal burning in coal fired power plants? %$* 540
surely the coal industry has something to do with that, but also there are a lot of jobs in that state tied to coal. %$* 540
so what has clean cheap gas provided for us in this pretty gray landscape so far? %$* 540
joe told you about how natural gas is taking market share from coal in the power sector right now. %$* 540
in 2012 alone, southern company, which is one of the biggest owners of a coal fired power plant fleet in the country, expects to generate almost half of its power from natural gas. %$* 540
that's three times the amount from gas as it was five years ago. %$* 540
and this is astonishing. %$* 540
coal has dropped from 70 percent of its fleet to 30 percent of its fleet-- %$* 540
of power generation. %$* 540
now, certainly in a compartmentalized way, americans often get really agitated about energy choices, but it's usually when it hits their backyard, as kate and deborah have told you. %$* 540
unfortunately, every form of energy is in somebody's backyard. %$* 540
many communities are split about shale gas. %$* 540
absolutely that's true. %$* 540
of course, some communities are split when they think that there's going to be a wal-mart coming because it affects the quality and tenor of their life in those areas. %$* 540
but think about it, every type of energy facility that you can think of has split communities, whether it's a wind farm in cape cod, the power lines across the midwest to tie the america's saudi arabia of wind to the people using wind in other parts of the country, nuclear plants, the case for shutting down existing coal plants, splits communities apart. %$* 540
these splits typically come down to jobs versus the environment, and that's surely the case here. %$* 540
where i do agree with kate and deborah is that shale gas development does have important environmental and community impact. %$* 540
should we regulate natural gas development more? %$* 540
absolutely we should. %$* 540
is regulation improving? %$* 540
absolutely it is. %$* 540
colorado and pennsylvania are the prime cases for advancements that are leapfrogging for best practices. %$* 540
the federal government is, too. %$* 540
should we drop the so-called halliburton loophole, which exempts water injections associated with hydraulic fracturing from the safe drinking water act? %$* 540
why not? %$* 540
wouldn’t that provide a lot of more public trust than we have right now? %$* 540
should we tighten up emissions of methane from the whole process? %$* 540
absolutely we should. %$* 540
but do we think that the united states should take shale gas off the table? %$* 540
no. %$* 540
that's unrealistic. %$* 540
it's not even sensible. %$* 540
if we somehow-- %$* 540
someone in the united states could decide to do that, because it did more harm then good, what would we get? %$* 540
we'd probably get a little bit more renewables, maybe a little faster. %$* 540
we would get a lot more coal use, and we'd have mountaintop mining, we'd have coal ash piles, some of which have recently spilled into rivers, we'd have much higher co2 emissions that contribute to global warming, and we'd have unhealthy levels of mercury emissions and other toxic chemicals. %$* 540
there's a solution to all of these issues. %$* 540
there are best practices. %$* 540
there should be much more aggressive attention to this. %$* 540
what i really wish is that people would stop demonizing this fuel, because it makes it impossible to find sensible solutions in the middle. %$* 540
there are sensible solutions in the middle. %$* 540
we should be working on enabling those to develop over time. %$* 540
our main argument is that the two principal sources of energy in the united states, coal and oil, are much more damaging to the environment than is natural gas, and that's for the communities where those are used as well as to the nation as a whole. %$* 540
thank you. %$* 540
sue tierney, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 540
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where the motion being argued is no fracking way: the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. %$* 13
now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
we have two teams of two members each here arguing against this motion. %$* 13
team arguing against fracking, the team that says essentially, "no fracking way," katherine hudson and deborah goldberg, we have heard them say that getting the price-- %$* 13
the price to be paid for getting the gas out of the ground is just too high, that it is an environmental threat, that it will ruin communities, that it is more expensive than it seems, that, in fact, the harms will outweigh the benefits that were laid out by the other sides. %$* 13
and they're basically saying that the boom is getting ahead of science, that we don't know what we're getting into. %$* 13
the other side, sue tierney and joe nocera, the defenders of fracking, the enthusiasts, are saying, "yes, there are risks involved, but they're manageable. %$* 13
regulations can be put into place." they compare it to coal. %$* 13
against coal, natural gas they say looks pretty clean, that if you look at this thing as the national security matter, as a jumpstart to an economy that needs it, that having this stuff underground and being able to get at it is an enormous gift that's dropped into our laps. %$* 13
so we're going to go through some of that now and explore some of what they were talking about in the debate. %$* 13
and i want to go first to the side that's arguing to-- %$* 13
the supporters of fracking. %$* 13
your opponents have made this statement that the boom is getting ahead of science and implicitly saying, "until we know a lot more, particularly on the environmental issue, the impact, we should slow down to stop." and you're saying the opposite. %$* 13
so take on the science issue and the not knowing and whether that is a signal to stop, either one of you, joe or-- %$* 13
well, first of all, i think we do know a lot. %$* 539
in any kind of boom, it is correct. %$* 539
industry goes in, and the environmentalists have done a great favor to the country because they've gotten on top of the fracking issues early-- %$* 539
but we do know that there's methane leakage, and there's science going on right now to figure out what that leakage is and how to make the well casings better. %$* 539
and that's one of a dozen examples where the issue of the chemicals-- %$* 539
you can go to websites now and see some of the-- %$* 539
most-- %$* 539
all of the chemicals. %$* 539

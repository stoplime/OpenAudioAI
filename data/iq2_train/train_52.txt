well, thank you all for coming. %$* 1
this is really exciting for us. %$* 1
this is a new venue, and it’s thrilling for us to be downtown in such magnificent space as this one. %$* 1
we have, of course, our new voting system which may have some flaws to iron out. %$* 1
we have a new relationship with bloomberg television that’s going to be televising these debates in addition to our longstanding relationship with national public radio, where these debates are heard in nearly two hundred radio markets around the country. %$* 1
we have a new relationship with newsweek magazine that’s going to be publishing a point/counterpoint of what rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.goes on this evening. %$* 1
so my role in these proceedings is really to frame the debate, to say why it is we thought this was an interesting topic and why there’s a reasonable amount to be said on both sides. %$* 1
so, as taxpayers, americans have funded about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars for the stimulus package, another seven hundred and fifty billion or more for tarp, to relieve the situation for financial institutions. %$* 1
and at a time of record unemployment doesn’t it make sense that these funds are used to the maximum extent possible to create jobs for americans? %$* 1
why not require that the institutions that receive this money hire american workers? %$* 1
why not, that the state governments and others who are expending these funds buy american products? %$* 1
but let’s consider second order consequences. %$* 1
if we protect high cost domestic producers there’s a cost to that in the form of higher prices for everyone else-- %$* 1
every consumer, every state and local government. %$* 1
and then think about the third order effects – the reactions of foreign governments. %$* 1
we impose a tax, a tariff on tires, the chinese retaliate with a tariff on chickens-- %$* 1
real world example of the last week or so. %$* 1
well, which of these is most important-- %$* 1
the immediate benefit of u.s. job creation or the cost to u.s. consumers and the risk of retaliatory response from our trading partners? %$* 1
the future of the global rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. economy may depend on getting the answer right and we have an extraordinarily able group of panelists this evening who i think are going to shed some light on this important issue and it’s my pleasure at this point to turn the evening over to john donvan. %$* 1
thank you, robert, very much. %$* 13
and this is the beginning of our fourth season and robert rosenkranz is why this is happening. %$* 13
so on this evening i just want to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
welcome to another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan and i will be moderating the six people you see here on the stage with me at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
we have two tables, six debaters, three against three. %$* 13
we’ll be debating this motion: buy american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
and here, our debaters arguing for the motion that buy american/hire american policies will backfire, jagdish bhagwati, university professor, economics and law at columbia university; douglas irwin, professor of economics at dartmouth college; and susan schwab, former united states trade representative. %$* 13
arguing against the motion we rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.have leo gerard, international president of the united steel workers; john r.macarthur, president and publisher of harper’s magazine; jeff madrick, senior fellow at the schwartz center for economic policy analysis at the new school. %$* 13
now, this is a debate so let’s remind ourselves of what the stakes are. %$* 13
there will be winners and losers tonight. %$* 13
this is a contest. %$* 13
this is a contest of ideas and persuasion and perhaps wit and humor, facts. %$* 13
but you in the audience play a crucial role in this contest because you are the judges. %$* 13
we are polling you both before and after the debate to establish where you stand on our motion. %$* 13
i will be reporting them in just a little while, once we’ve had the first results tabulated. %$* 13
but once again, to remind you, our motion is that buy american/hire american policies will backfire and we would like now to go to our vote for the final time. %$* 13
if any of the members of the audience still would like another chance to vote, if you put your hands up i’ll know that the answer to that is yes. %$* 13
and it looks like no. %$* 13
so everybody has, everybody has voted. %$* 13
so the results are being tabulated. %$* 13
we will have you a vote once again at the end of the debate and the side that has changed the most minds, who has moved the largest percentage into their camp in the course of the evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.let’s get to the debate. %$* 13
speaking for the motion first, i’m sorry, i thought i had something out of the order. %$* 13
speaking for the motion first, douglas irwin, a professor at dartmouth college. %$* 13
free trade under fire is the title of his latest book and those four words will tell us why he is here to argue for the motion that buy american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
douglas irwin. %$* 13
well, i apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but i used up most of it yesterday when i achieved a childhood dream of seeing the green bay packers play at lambeau field. %$* 241
and i learned, aside from the fact that green bay can lose a game they’re supposed to win, i learned that you can get very funny faces on people’s faces when, very funny looks on people’s faces when you amble up to them in green bay and say, so what do you think of them buy american provisions? %$* 241
it doesn’t, it doesn’t work so well. %$* 241
it’s a real conversation stopper. %$* 241
what i’d like to do is remind you of the proposition before you tonight and that is whether buy american provisions will backfire. %$* 241
in fact, they’ve already backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the affirmative. %$* 241
first of all, what is buy american? %$* 241
buy american rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase of u.s.made products in government contracts. %$* 241
now, in some sense, who could be against buy american? %$* 241
i want people to buy american products. %$* 241
i want a strong and healthy and vibrant american economy. %$* 241
i want good jobs and good wages for american workers. %$* 241
i think we can all agree on those propositions. %$* 241
but that’s not the issue. %$* 241
the debate here tonight is about the means to that laudable end. %$* 241
buy america may sound like it’s a good idea, but the more you think about it, it’s actually counterproductive. %$* 241
let me give you a specific example of what buy america is. %$* 241
in the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier, that john donvan mentioned-- %$* 241
it was passed by congress earlier this year-- %$* 241
one section requires the use of american made steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers. %$* 241
now, this is a good deal for the american steel industry but it’s a bad deal for the rest of us. %$* 241
by raising the cost of construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those projects. %$* 241
that means fewer jobs will be created with the limited amount of money we have to spend. %$* 241
if we have to pay a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money for all the other projects. %$* 241
in fact, this is not a trivial matter. %$* 241
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.picture in your mind for a moment the bay bridge in san francisco. %$* 241
there’s a lot of steel in that bridge. %$* 241
california had to repair the bridge a few years ago and the buy america provisions were enforced. %$* 241
the domestic steel bid came in at, guess what? %$* 241
, twenty-three percent above the foreign bid. %$* 241
now, why it wasn’t twenty-four percent above, i don’t know. %$* 241
but that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair the bridge. %$* 241
that’s almost half a billion dollars for one project. %$* 241
now, what can you do with half a billion dollars? %$* 241
instead of paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads, build new bridges, build new schools, invest in green technology, provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt. %$* 241
bankrupting the state of california. %$* 241
that’s more than just paying more and getting less. %$* 241
the real problem is this: buy america is a bad jobs creation program. %$* 241
steel is very capital intensive so when we increase production we don’t hire a lot of new workers. %$* 241
there are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in the united states. %$* 241
there are seven million construction workers. %$* 241
there are 1.5 million unemployed construction workers. %$* 241
construction is really labor intensive. %$* 241
so if we spend more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction projects that will employ more construction workers who really rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.need the jobs. %$* 241
so why do we give u.s. steel producers a twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and other bidders? %$* 241
well, they were the only industry that was powerful enough to get it into law. %$* 241
it’s corporate welfare, pure and simple. %$* 241
what percent of the steel sold in the united states is made in the united states? %$* 241
seventy percent. %$* 241
they control seventy percent of the market and they want more and they want the taxpayer to pay for it. %$* 241
buy america has already backfired because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects and therefore, delay getting people back to work. %$* 241
in perkins, oklahoma they’re planning on building a new waste water plant for fifteen million dollars. %$* 241
it was shovel ready. %$* 241
the government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free stimulus money. %$* 241
but it wasn’t free. %$* 241
it came with buy america and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the project even more than the town would be getting from the federal government. %$* 241
so now the town has to go out and borrow more money to get the project going. %$* 241
and this is not an isolated example. %$* 241
here’s a news article from last week’s wall st. %$* 241
journal how buy america can hurt u.s. firms, and it talks about how, various ways in which u.s. firms cannot bid on rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. municipal projects here in the united states because they may make components that are sent for final processing in canada. %$* 241
they come back from canada, and it’s called a canadian product even though a lot of the value added is made here in the united states. %$* 241
and that just doesn’t make sense. %$* 241
many think that buy america is aimed at china. %$* 241
well, we aimed at china but we hit canada and now we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. %$* 241
canadian governments are boycotting u.s.firms in their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the united states. %$* 241
so in sum, buy america is not a good idea. %$* 241
it raises the cost of-- %$* 241
it sounds like a good idea but it’s not a good idea. %$* 241
it raises the cost of infrastructure projects. %$* 241
it pads the bottom line of the steel industry. %$* 241
it reduces the number of construction workers we can employ with our precious tax dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative market, those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even more manufacturing jobs here in the united states. %$* 241
i’m sure you’ve heard of the saying, what’s good for gm is good for america. %$* 241
well, we know that’s not true. %$* 241
and what’s good for the steel industry, its workers and its executives is not good for america, either, necessarily. %$* 241
so buy america is rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.costly corporate welfare. %$* 241
it’s already backfired. %$* 241
please vote affirmative. %$* 241
thank you very much. %$* 241
john %$* 241
thank you, douglas irwin. %$* 13
and now to argue against the motion that buy american/hire american policies will backfire, leo gerard, who is the son of a miner from canada. %$* 13
and now that he is international president of the united steel workers, when he steps up to that microphone he has eight hundred, fifty thousand union members standing behind him. %$* 13
leo gerard. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 242
i have to tell you that i’ve discarded a lot of my notes because i want to correct the previous speaker. %$* 242
the fact of the matter is that china did win the bid for the bay bridge and the fact of the matter is that the bay bridge is now almost eight months behind schedule and that the steel that came from china won’t hold the weld. %$* 242
and they’re not sure if they’re going to have to rip it all down and rebuild it, so that, if we talk about what that represents in lost dollars and productivity, it’s way more than the number that doug used. %$* 242
let me then go back to my notes. %$* 242
the fact of the matter is that three trillion tax dollars per year are spent by the federal government in federal procurement. %$* 242
and no one is saying that it’s simply, that you get the money that comes from rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. tax dollars and you use it to buy chinese goods. %$* 242
and then the fact of the matter is this has gone through the roof since the passage of nafta and pntr.and what we’ve done is we’ve lost, in our manufacturing base from 1949 to ’69, manufacturing was twenty-eight percent of the economy of america and we were the world’s largest creditor nation. %$* 242
by the time we got to the end of last year manufacturing was nine percent of the economy and we have now become the world’s largest debtor nation. %$* 242
the fact of the matter is, if we don’t start buying products that are made here, what we’ll end up doing is borrowing chinese money to import chinese parts and have laid-off workers. %$* 242
and the fact of the matter is that buy america stimulates the economy, creates good jobs, makes the industrial economy work and if the industrial economy works then we need engineers, innovation and we need the other pieces that make that economy hum. %$* 242
there was all kinds of yelling and screaming, when the buy america provision was made public in the stimulus bill, like this is something new. %$* 242
there’s been buy america provisions since 1930s. %$* 242
and the fact of the matter is that they’ve been good for creating jobs. %$* 242
if we go back to the period from 1994 when we abandoned, in a much more aggressive way, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.industrial manufacturing in america, in that period of time america has accumulated a 6.5 trillion dollar trade debt. %$* 242
we’ve had twenty-five years in a row, exacerbated since 1994, of year after year after year record breaking trade deficits. %$* 242
this year people will say, yeah, well, the trade deficit’s falling down. %$* 242
it’s probably going to come in around five hundred billion dollars and we’ve had a huge drop. %$* 242
that’s simply because there’s no purchasing power and we’ve had the collapse of the credit markets. %$* 242
there can be an argument made that a large part of the economic collapse that we saw is because there was too much money in the wrong direction. %$* 242
and the fact of the matter is that, that money, making its hands into a much, much smaller group, led to an inability of us to sustain. %$* 242
and we’ve, over the last fifteen years, gone to personal debt that is unsustainable. %$* 242
all of that because we’ve abandoned the idea of not only making things in america, but buying things that are made in america. %$* 242
i won’t spend too much time, but if we look at what’s going on in most of our trading partners, in the e.u. and spend time with china. %$* 242
i never heard a word in america when french president sarkozy said that they’re going to stimulate their economy and they’re going to stimulate their auto industry on the condition that every taxpayer dollar of rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. french currency that’s invested in france is going to go to prop up the french auto industry and the french auto industry had to commit to no layoffs. %$* 242
surprisingly, the european economy is bouncing back faster than ours. %$* 242
i didn’t hear a word. %$* 242
i didn’t hear a word when in may the chinese government said that their stimulus program was going to be steered and directed towards not just buy china-- %$* 242
there is a slight difference-- %$* 242
buy chinese. %$* 242
i didn’t hear a word here. %$* 242
think of the auto industry. %$* 242
i’ve only ever driven a north american car, big three. %$* 242
i’ve never had a bad one. %$* 242
but for some reason, we’re prepared as a society to tolerate a deficit in automobiles between south korea and japan of forty-five billion dollars a year. %$* 242
if a billion dollars equals thirteen thousand family-supporting jobs, just in the auto sector, year after year after year, we can’t get into their market. %$* 242
they have a view that buying a japanese car in japan is a good thing. %$* 242
china has recently announced that it intends to dominate the world in renewable energy products. %$* 242
a company called suntech power holdings said in an interview that to build market share-- %$* 242
this is what’s coming from china-- %$* 242
to build market share it’s selling solar panels on the american market rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.for less than the cost of materials, assembly and shipping. %$* 242
this is a decision made in china. %$* 242
and we’re saying that we want to be the leader in renewable energy but we don’t have a program to stimulate demand or to buy renewable energy products that are made in america. %$* 242
having said that, i see that my time is up. %$* 242
but keep in mind that in order to do that china cheats on its currency, it manipulates its cost of production and we sit back and say that it would cost us jobs if we did the same thing. %$* 242
leo gerard, thank you very much. %$* 13
i just want to make the request to-- %$* 13
back on cell phones, if anybody still has their cell phone turned on as a result of the voting exercise, to turn it off now because i’ve been told it might be interfering with the radio waves might be interfering with some of the audio in the room. %$* 13
so i’ll just listen to everybody’s phones sing for a second while that happens. %$* 13
and again, for newcomers, i want to explain that we have opening statements of seven minutes each. %$* 13
that will be followed by a round of head to head debate in which i’ll ask questions and you’ll ask questions. %$* 13
and at the end of the evening we’ll have summary statements of two minutes each, after which you will vote once again. %$* 13
are all of the cell phones off? %$* 13
it looks like they are. %$* 13
to resume, the motion here is that buy rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
and our next debater is going to argue in the affirmative. %$* 13
he thinks that buy american will backfire, not surprisingly, because he is one of the world’s pre-eminent economists and has long argued that globalization is the world’s most powerful force for social good. %$* 13
from columbia university, jagdish bhagwati. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 243
let me just begin first by emphasizing a point which doug irwin made, but in relation to a story. %$* 243
when i was a student at oxford one of my professors actually told me that he’d gone to whitehall to advise and he was surprised to find that while he thought economics oversimplified things, that in fact, people in whitehall were working with even more simplistic models. %$* 243
they usually thought x led to y and they stopped there. %$* 243
y leading to z, z leading in turn to x.all of that was completely beyond them. %$* 243
they were extremely oversimplifying. %$* 243
the problem, i think, with mr. %$* 243
gerard is, i think, as doug was pointing out, and with the opposing side basically, is that you think that buy america will create jobs in the steel using sectors, for example, or in the steel industry. %$* 243
first, in fact, x affects y. but what does that do to the rest of the system? %$* 243
because you are then opening up a whole series rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the initial primary impact. %$* 243
and that’s essentially what we need to focus on. %$* 243
what are these additional effects? %$* 243
one, of course, is that downstream industries typically become more uncompetitive. %$* 243
we know when president bush put on the steel tariffs in ’92 the effect was, in fact, to price out a whole lot of steel using industries, including autos, which indeed, there was a famous study which shows that about two hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a few basically through protecting steel. %$* 243
so that’s point number one. %$* 243
the second point is that you get out of this, and still, even if we didn’t have this problem we would have the problem of retaliation. %$* 243
and i would say it’s not tit for tat retaliation necessarily. %$* 243
it’s also monkey see, monkey do kind of imitation. %$* 243
while we do something others do the same thing. %$* 243
if you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion of all kinds of trade barriers, starting out from the smoot- hawley, et cetera. %$* 243
and this, i think, led to essentially what we in economics call a nuclear winter, basically. %$* 243
there was a chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers. %$* 243
that came home to roost in turn, on our export performance, on everybody’s export performance. %$* 243
and i think this is something we need to remember, that as we go into this, policies like buy rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.america, that is what we are going to get into. %$* 243
we already see that, as doug was pointing out, in a variety of fields. %$* 243
and i’m sure susan will pick up that theme. %$* 243
the large numbers of actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of these kinds of tariffs. %$* 243
and we are actually the biggest traders in the world. %$* 243
every state has export industries. %$* 243
i’ve been looking at that. %$* 243
you have basically, therefore, a lot of your jobs at stake. %$* 243
and those are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through buy america provisions. %$* 243
i think this is, if you look at buy america, if you know a little bit of history-- %$* 243
i know just a little bit and doug knows much more-- %$* 243
but buy america, when did it first get passed in this country? %$* 243
it has to be in this country, obviously, if it was buy america. %$* 243
it was 1933, right after the depression, the great and that’s what set the stage. %$* 243
and i think we are now re-enacting that after this current crisis. %$* 243
so beware, is all i say. %$* 243
caveat emptor, if you want, feel inclined to be working for the other side. %$* 243
then i think we also got the argument, to look at the negative arguments produced by mr. %$* 243
gerard in his interesting comment, he said, well, manufacturers are important and we need to support them. %$* 243
and he’s not the first one to have said that. %$* 243
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.there has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in england, about twenty years ago. %$* 243
there was also a berkeley movement called manufacturing matters. %$* 243
and i think mr. %$* 243
gerard is really harking back to it. %$* 243
and this is a case where you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive externalities. %$* 243
and i would simply say, i’ll just quote my old teacher, professor solow, who is nobel laureate and the father figure on the democratic side. %$* 243
i’m a democrat. %$* 243
he said, i know there are lots of industries in massive externalities. %$* 243
but there’s a four dollar worth of marginal, social marginal product and the private margin product is one, one dollar. %$* 243
and he said, my problem is i don’t know which ones they are. %$* 243
and the problem is, and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know where the externalities are. %$* 243
and i think this is the problem. %$* 243
it’s not that we don’t believe that there are externalities, but for mr. %$* 243
gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or in manufacturers more generally has never been proven. %$* 243
and i don’t think any democrat would support that view. %$* 243
in fact, what we do is essentially to argue that we must support broader policies like r&d support and so on, but not go into specific activities cause that’s exactly the wrong way to go and it gets captured by, by several people. %$* 243
and i think this is rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.what we need to worry about. %$* 243
finally, i would just touch on one thing which drives, i think, the union movement. %$* 243
and i can understand their fear because i can easily produce models being a theorist also, aside from an activist on these issues. %$* 243
one can easily produce models where international trade actually affects your workers, that in fact the fear is, on the part of unions, that trade with the poor countries produces paupers in the rich countries. %$* 243
now, a lot of work has been done on this. %$* 243
actually, there’s very little evidence of this. %$* 243
in fact, there are studies, including my own with bob lawrence at harvard, which show actually that the pressure on our wages, which is a real problem and, you know, as a democrat i’m entirely sympathetic to the problem. %$* 243
that has been brought about by extremely acute labor saving technical change, by the fact that the unionization has also gone down for reasons which don’t have much to do with globalization or trade. %$* 243
given that, i think a lot of us have argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries, trade with emerging countries has actually kept the consumption cost of workers’ wages down. %$* 243
so it, in fact, it has moderated the-- %$* 243
so i will pick up the argument later. %$* 243
jagdish bhagwati, i’m sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
so i will pick up the argument later. %$* 243
i want to help, ask you to help with a little piece of radio production. %$* 13
at this point on the npr broadcast they take a break. %$* 13
and then we come back again to the broadcast and it’s very helpful if it’s refreshed with a round of applause from all of you. %$* 13
so i’d like to ask you to do that. %$* 13
welcome back to another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
the proposition we are debating here is: buy american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
we have six panelists, three against three. %$* 13
and next to speak against the motion: buy american/hire american policies will backfire, john r.macarthur, known as rick. %$* 13
he is president and publisher of harper’s magazine, the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in america and also one of the most progressive. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, rick macarthur. %$* 13
i have totell you that i wrote a book about nafta, called the selling of free trade. %$* 244
that’s why i’m here, not because i’m publisher of harper’s magazine. %$* 244
but may i make a cheap debater’s point right at the outset and say that professor irwin has already veered off the proposition. %$* 244
this is a, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.the question i thought that was put was, buy american policies, not the buy american provision in the legislation that just passed six or eight months ago. %$* 244
and if we’re going to discuss this broadly we have to talk about tariffs versus free trade, protectionism versus free trade. %$* 244
that’s what we’re really talking about here. %$* 244
i would also add that, i hope we can come back to smoot-hawley because smoot-hawley is a canard, as it is acknowledged by many, many mainstream economists who say that it had little or no affect on exacerbating the great depression. %$* 244
but there’s a reason why thomas carlyle called economics the dismal science. %$* 244
i happen to think it’s because he understood intuitively that it was not a science, and that it’s not a science because you cannot conduct a controlled experiment in economics the way you can in hard science, in real science. %$* 244
and as a non-science, we have to turn back to the great theorists of free trade and the anti-protectionists like david ricardo and richard cobden and understand that they, in the early 19th century, could not imagine a world where anybody with money and labor could plug into a power source anywhere in the world and make virtually anything. %$* 244
these theorists, to whom professor bhagwati, professor irwin and many of their colleagues cling with religious fervor, with-- %$* 244
i might even say-- %$* 244
marxist fervor, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. because ricardo had a great influence on marx, is what distorts the debate. %$* 244
as then mit economist paul krugman, who was and still is a partisan of free trade, noted in a 1991 book called geography and trade, the quote: the tendency of international economists to turn a blind eye to the fact that countries both occupy and exist in space, a tendency so deeply entrenched that we rarely even realize we are doing it, has, i would submit, had some serious costs. %$* 244
these lie not so much in lack of realism-- %$* 244
all economic analysis is more or less unrealistic-- %$* 244
as in the exclusion of important issues, and above all, important sources of evidence. %$* 244
now, let’s admit, on the protectionist side, that buy american policies are indirect tariffs, indirect subsidies, whatever you want to call them. %$* 244
and there are many statistics to support the protectionist model. %$* 244
i don’t pretend they’re definitive any more than my economist friends can make the argument that their statistics or their studies are definitive because they’re not scientific experiments. %$* 244
but since we’re talking about protectionism versus free trade, essentially, we can site some spectacularly successful protectionist schemes, mexico, poor, beleaguered, exploited mexico in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, had a program called import rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.substitution, a nice way of saying, or a technical way of saying, buy mexican. %$* 244
and mexico enjoyed the highest growth rates in its history, through the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, of, roughly, i think averaging about 7 percent. %$* 244
just to give you a more specific recent example, we still have a 25 percent tariff, import tariff on pickup trucks in the united states. %$* 244
that’s why, toyota, until very recently, was still manufacturing pickups at their nummi, joint operating plant in fremont, california, in their joint operation with general motors. %$* 244
that’s what kept toyota in the game, was the 25 percent tariff on imported pickups. %$* 244
it’s probably not a coincidence that in 1945, the average us tariff on dutiable imports was 28 percent. %$* 244
and in the same year, manufacturing employment which as you all knows pays better than working at wal-mart, manufacturing employment as a percentage of total us employment was 35 percent. %$* 244
it’s also likely not a coincidence, that in 2008, the average tariff on dutiable imports was 4 percent—by the way these are professor irwin’s numbers— and in the same year manufacturing employment as a percentage of to—total us employment, was just under 10 percent. %$* 244
now. %$* 244
again, this is anecdotal evidence, i don’t pretend it’s scientific, but in 1979, the year in which manufacturing employment peaked in the united states, the median weekly earnings for all us workers in 2009 dollars, was $716.47.in the second quarter of 2009, the median weekly rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.earnings for us workers, was $734, just slightly above, so we can make the argument that a pro-free trade, lower-tariff economy has possibly contributed to the stagnation of wages, i think we can say anecdotally, that because manufacturing employment has declined, and manufacturing jobs pay better than service jobs generally speaking, this has contributed to the stagnation of wages. %$* 244
now, this is not only happening in the, labor-intensive traditional assembly-line jobs. %$* 244
business week just had a cover story called “america’s manufacturing crisis” in which they talked about, the crisis in high-tech manufacturing. %$* 244
and the causes of this manufacturing decline in american high- tech, quote, “are numerous, complex, and a long time in the making.” that’s from willy shih, a harvard business school professor who used to work at ibm, and used to run eastman kodak’s digital consumer products union. %$* 244
and then, business week goes on, to paraphrase they say two decades of unconstrained outsourcing to asia have hollowed out much of america’s base of supplies, factory managers, and skilled technicians. %$* 244
us private capital markets meanwhile are loath to tie up their billions in factories and machinery. %$* 244
in the boom years from 1994 to 1999, when then economy surged 26 percent, us manufacturing capacity went up by 44 percent. %$* 244
okay? %$* 244
but from 2002 through 2007 when the us expanded by 17 percent, manufacturing capacity rose a paltry 5 percent. %$* 244
okay. %$* 244
and i’ll just say that, it’s no coincidence that permanent normal trade relations with china were passed, in 2000. john %$* 244
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. rick macarthur, your time’s up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 244
and i’ll just say that, it’s no coincidence that permanent normal trade relations with china were passed, in 2000. john %$* 244
thank you. %$* 13
our next debater susan schwab was to any of our international trading partners the face of us trade, holding as she did the post of united states trade representative in the george w.bush administration, that is a cabinet-level position. %$* 13
she saw firsthand government thinking on trade and she also influenced it, and now at the university of maryland, she is here to argue, that buy american, hire american policies will backfire, susan schwab. %$* 13
thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us here today to debate this very timely and very interesting and very complicated topic. %$* 245
i’m going to start by talking about hire american policies, which is part of this debate although no one’s talked about it yet and i’m going to make quick work of that, because quite frankly hire american restrictions are un- american. %$* 245
they are discriminatory, they reek of discrimination, they deny us the very diversity that has made the united states, as competitive as we are. %$* 245
immigrants built this nation and all rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.you need to do is look at some of the companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ millions of americans, including google, intel, ebay, yahoo, proctor and gamble, dupont and even us steel. %$* 245
buy american? %$* 245
buy american sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and, unfortunately, buy american policies hurt america, and hurt americans. %$* 245
and we have history to point to and we have, the fact that the united states has to export to grow, to point to, and the fact that the risk of retaliation is very, very real indeed, let’s start with history. %$* 245
rick mentioned smoot-hawley, well, guess what. %$* 245
in the smoot-hawley tariff act we raised our tariffs, it was perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time. %$* 245
it ultimately prolonged and deepened the great depression. %$* 245
no country, no country has ever reached or sustained a level of prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy, with trade protectionism as their policy, with buy national policies. %$* 245
in fact if you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 1990s, were countries that opened their markets, followed our lead by the way, opening our markets. %$* 245
they grew three times faster than the countries that did not open their markets. %$* 245
95 percent of the world’s population, meaning the world’s consumers, live outside of our borders. %$* 245
those are our customers and if anyone thinks that we americans have enough money to buy our way to recovery, and to future competitiveness without rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.exports, you’ve got another thing coming. %$* 245
half of gdp growth, more than half of global gdp growth going forward over the next five years, will come in the advanced developing countries. %$* 245
the bulk of global economic growth will come outside the united states. %$* 245
and if you’re talking about stimulus packages and quite frankly, rick, this debate is about buy american policies, meaning the government telling us, that it will not buy foreign goods whether they are higher quality, whether they are better priced. %$* 245
$3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years, by other countries on stimulus. %$* 245
globally. %$* 245
we need a piece of that. %$* 245
and if you are a caterpillar worker in illinois, if you work for g.e., if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the united states that sell to these countries, you want a part of that action. %$* 245
china is going to be spending the vast majority of the $550 billion it’s putting into stimulus, on infrastructure. %$* 245
that is business for american exporters. %$* 245
india is going to be spending anywhere from $20-$70 billion in roads construction. %$* 245
now. %$* 245
this issue, this canard, of—that we don’t manufacture anything, is utterly absurd. %$* 245
some of you may be surprised to know that the united states remains the single biggest manufacturer in the world, bar none. %$* 245
$1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs, china is a distant second, at $1.3 trillion, with japan and germany following up to the rear. %$* 245
one in six manufacturing jobs depends on exports, 6 million us jobs depend on manufactured good rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.exports. %$* 245
and if you look at us economic growth you discover, that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our gdp, not 9 percent. %$* 245
and it continues to grow, our manufacturing output. %$* 245
yes, our manufacturing employment, because of productivity enhancements, technology, has not kept pace. %$* 245
but if you look for example at a company like ups that tells us for every 40 new packages that are shipped overseas, they hire a new american worker. %$* 245
those are high-paying blue-collar jobs, fed ex, exactly the same kind of statistics. %$* 245
and in many cases you’re talking about, these are teamsters who are going to be hired. %$* 245
retaliation, retaliation is not some myth, retaliation is very, very real, not only did we see it after %$* 245
smoot-hawley, we saw it after the buy american language, it is not coincidence, that within six weeks of the buy american legislature on the stimulus package moving through the united states congress, it is not coincidence that the chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor local companies, because before that a lot of americans were starting to make a lot of money in those markets. %$* 245
we need access to those markets, and we need to be exporting to stay competitive. %$* 245
the folks who are telling us, this isn’t going to happen, they are ignoring the fact that the canadians have already retaliated, the chinese have already retaliated. %$* 245
the us chamber of commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this global stimulus bonanza that is out there, that we lose because of rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.retaliation, we lose 175,000 jobs. %$* 245
that eclipses the, what, eight, 9,000 jobs that the petersen institute has told us could possibly be created in the steel industry in the united states, and doug has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in construction and so on. %$* 245
so let me close %$* 245
as follows. %$* 245
one, remind you, there is zero evidence that buy national policies create more jobs than they sacrifice, and in fact the data is very, very compelling the other way, trade isolationism kills jobs, it does not create jobs. %$* 245
buy american sounds good. %$* 245
and the issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are legitimate issues. %$* 245
but buy american policies and trade isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are describing. %$* 245
buy american sounds good, good sound bite, bad policy, hurts america, hurts american jobs, thank you. %$* 245
and finally, speaking against the motion, “buy american-hire american policies will backfire,” jeff madrick, a business journalist and visiting professor at the cooper union, in the mid- 1990s he predicted the end of affluence with a bestseller that went by that very name. %$* 13
his latest book, the case for big government—the title alone tells you much about his political take on the world, as he argues now against the motion, ladies and gentlemen, jeff madrick. %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.thank you, thank you, i’m delighted to be here. %$* 246
i was once a free-trader myself, as was philip verlager who i see had a letter in the new york times just sunday saying he was once a free- trader. %$* 246
worked for the petersen institute, decided it was totally unrealistic. %$* 246
enough is enough. %$* 246
i’m a little tired of people who keep telling us—not these people. %$* 246
that wasn’t aimed at you, that, uh— little tired of being told time and again, that being worried about free trade is an oversimplified point of view. %$* 246
i’m a little tired of being given simplistic examples, of where buying, say, steel in the us, will raise construction costs and therefore cost american jobs. %$* 246
i’m tired of being told that empirical studies invariably show that free trade will create—has almost no effect on jobs in the us, and you know i better tell you the truth about that, because, i have a whole bunch of things to say, i’m not going to get to them, and i’m going to forget some. %$* 246
the fact of the matter is, despite what professor bhagwati said, and despite his own studies, most studies find a direct negative impact, from free trade on wages, and on the creation of jobs. %$* 246
most studies. %$* 246
not by wide-eyed progressives from the new school, but by mainstream economists. %$* 246
most studies, so let’s get the facts straight. %$* 246
i want to go down this list because this is too important, i’m afraid, to rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.leave to economic theorists. %$* 246
i believed in ricardian economics, i still do. %$* 246
exchange is the key to economic growth. %$* 246
you have something i want, i want something—i have something you want. %$* 246
it leads to economic growth, but it is a narrow idealistic theory, in a very complex world. %$* 246
first, buy america is not illegal. %$* 246
china agreed to the very terms we are citing in this stimulus bill. %$* 246
that’s number one. %$* 246
it is not illegal, neither by the way are the tariffs on tires. %$* 246
not illegal, they agreed to it, in the international agreements. %$* 246
number two. %$* 246
the fiscal policy becomes necessarily ineffective when 20 to 30 to 40 percent of every dollar we spend, to pump up our economy in a recessionary emergency, leaks overseas. %$* 246
we’re not saying all—we should not have exports and imports, nobody on my teams thinks we shouldn’t have export growth, and even import growth. %$* 246
nobody i know believes that. %$* 246
but we do want effective fiscal policy and that is what we are talking about in the narrow sense. %$* 246
will there be a trade war? %$* 246
darn it, i am tired of these scare tactics, i’m tired of claiming there will be a repeat of the 1930s. %$* 246
is china up in arms against this policy, i suspect china is now willing to talk a little bit, because they see maybe president obama is ever so slightly serious about imposing rights he was given in international treaties into which china agreed. %$* 246
is china not pushing its tires, a surge in tires here? %$* 246
of course they are. %$* 246
and that was a response, another issue. %$* 246
let’s stop isolating this economic theory rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.from the real world. %$* 246
china subsidizes, all kinds of countries subsidize, all kinds of countries push exports. %$* 246
we have to begin to realize that. %$* 246
let’s look at what’s happened, and i’m skipping as you can tell a little bit, let’s look at what’s happened in america since free trade. %$* 246
don’t think this side of the podium is fighting an uphill battle. %$* 246
they won. %$* 246
they’ve won for decades. %$* 246
tariffs have come down significantly. %$* 246
and where does america stand in terms of wages, you’d think, judging by what some of them said, we’re doing great. %$* 246
the median male worker in america today, makes less than the median male worker after inflation did in the 1970s. %$* 246
think about that. %$* 246
that stagnation probably never occurred in american economic history before. %$* 246
we did some numbers on this, it’s pretty stun— i’m not going to go into those because, my time is running low, maybe we’ll get to it in the q-and-a.frank levy, and peter temin, mainstream economists, at mit, are alarmed, that annual earnings of all workers, not just males, male and female, all races, all ethnicities, plus fringe benefits, which people often say are left out by—people like robert lawrence often make this case—plus fringe benefits haven’t been keeping up with productivity since roughly the late 1970s. %$* 246
wages are supposed to keep up with productivity. %$* 246
what’s going on, is free trade part of this? %$* 246
i think it is part of it. %$* 246
is it all of it, no, is it most of it, it may not even be most of it. %$* 246
but it’s probably some of it and we’ve gotta start rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.thinking about that. %$* 246
i have to say one other thing about economic theory while i’m going through this litany. %$* 246
there is a very strong emphasis on keeping wages down in america, you may have noticed, every time wages go up the federal reserve in the good old days, that was before the crisis, would try to push wages down because it was going to be inflationary. %$* 246
a very important theory of why economies grow, has been thrown aside. %$* 246
that is economies grow because american workers, and the immigrant workers who come to america make enough money to support demand so the companies can grow. %$* 246
and then companies invest. %$* 246
all through american history, wages rose inexorably. %$* 246
in america, median wages, average wages, rose, and were a source of economic growth. %$* 246
that stopped somewhere in the 1970s. %$* 246
and we better start thinking about it, what am i thinking, what am i talking about? %$* 246
not full-scale protectionism, not the end of exports and imports. %$* 246
but a serious, committed, complex %$* 246
not simple theory, of why economies grow, but a complex analysis and approach to dealing with a high dollar. %$* 246
with high debt in america. %$* 246
with trade inequalities. %$* 246
with industrial policies and export subsidies overseas. %$* 246

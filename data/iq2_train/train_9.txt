thank you, thank you very much, it’s a pleasure to welcome you. %$* 1
it’s my role in these evening’s to try to frame the debate, give the reasons why we thought this was a worthwhile topic. %$* 1
let me start out by saying—just giving you a fact—in 2006, which was the last year before the financial crisis started to unfold, financial companies earned about 43% of all the profits earned by the standard & poor’s 500.well that seems extraordinary when you think about the size of the financial sector. %$* 1
and how is that possible? %$* 1
well it turns out that those profits were to a large degree illusory. %$* 1
it was almost like there was a giant ponzi scheme going on, where financial institutions were selling assets to each other at ever ever higher prices, ever “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) ever greater degrees of leverage. %$* 1
and among those assets were about 6 trillion dollars in structured securities. %$* 1
structured securities business is a construct of the ratings agencies, who through the alchemy of their own logic have turned the dross of subprime mortgages and other dodgy credits into the gold of triple a securities. %$* 1
the big 5 investment banking firms at the beginning of 2007 had total assets of 4.3 trillion dollars. %$* 1
to put that into perspective, the national budget of the united states in those years was about 3 trillion dollars. %$* 1
they were leveraged greater than 30 to 1.their assets were long-term in nature, frequently quite risky, frequently illiquid, and they were financed with mostly liabilities payable on demand. %$* 1
most of the managements of these institutions were completely incapable of managing the risks that their firms were assuming. %$* 1
now turning to the commercial banks, think about chuck prince, the ceo of citicorp. %$* 1
he ignored the storm warnings as he steered citicorp onto the rocks with his infamous quote, “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” okay, so why blame washington for this mess? %$* 1
well, there are a number of plausible reasons. %$* 1
first, the fed supplied way to much credit and way too little supervision. %$* 1
it allowed banks to assume off-balance sheet liabilities, and contingent obligations “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) with no disclosure and with no capital requirements. %$* 1
fannie mae, freddie mac led a headlong push to extend home ownership to americans who were clearly unqualified financially to own their own homes. %$* 1
the sec allowed the investment firms to triple their leverage, and this was only about five years ago. %$* 1
and the regulators put the force of law behind rating agency judgments so that their mistakes were not just private-sector actors making mistakes, but had huge systematic consequences. %$* 1
and finally, nobody stepped up to provide the most elementary safeguards for credit default swaps. %$* 1
and that is the mechanism by which so many financial institutions are tied to each other, and it’s the mechanism that has created so much of a domino effect in our financial system. %$* 1
so, there is a lot of blame to go around. %$* 1
and to help sort out who deserves more blame, we have an outstanding panel tonight, and i think we’re in for a very, very exciting and elucidating evening. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
i would just like to invite one more round of applause for our chairman who makes this possible, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan, your host, and i will also be moderating as the debaters you see sharing the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) stage here with me at the casparyy auditorium at the rockefeller university in new york city. %$* 13
two tables, three against three, will be debating this motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” now, this debate is not a panel discussion or a seminar, it is a contest, a contest of ideas and logic and wit, and perhaps charisma and humor. %$* 13
but most of all persuasion, because by the time this debate concludes, you the audience will have voted twice, both before the debate, and again afterward, your vote is to side with or against our teams on the stage and their position. %$* 13
at the end of the debate the team that has changed most minds over the course of the debate, will be declared the winner. %$* 13
at this point then let’s do our first vote, you go to the keypads by your side, and i’ll give you about 30 seconds to register your position. %$* 13
the motion is, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” press number 1 if you agree with the motion, number 2 if you disagree, number 3 if you are undecided. %$* 13
does anyone need more time? %$* 13
everyone figured that out, okay. %$* 13
all right, thank you, we’re gonna lock in the votes and we’ll begin the debate. %$* 13
now you have already completed the first vote and i will have the results from that first vote shortly. %$* 13
but now, round 1, opening statements, uninterrupted, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) seven minutes, each debater from each side, speaking in alternate turns, beginning with the side for the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” our first debater, niall ferguson of harvard university, he is an economic historian which means he is an explainer. %$* 13
and his most recent book, the ascent of money, begins in its early chapters explaining with such eloquence that a third-grader could understand it. %$* 13
by the end of the book, niall, you’ve taken on the mess that we’re in now. %$* 13
and i don’t know if anyone really understands that. %$* 13
niall ferguson. %$* 13
well thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you tonight, nothing would be easier, than to blame everything on the bankers. %$* 158
think of richard fuld %$* 158
of lehman brothers. %$* 158
in 2007 his compensation, for the year, was $72 million. %$* 158
the year before his firm collapsed. %$* 158
never to be seen again. %$* 158
or james cayne of bear stearns who made $290 million, in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace. %$* 158
not only were the bankers greedy, we would agree. %$* 158
they were also, in many cases, incompetent. %$* 158
but i and my colleagues are not here to praise them, or to defend them. %$* 158
we blame them for much of what has gone wrong. %$* 158
it’s just that we blame the politicians %$* 158
more. %$* 158
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) we’ve already heard quoted tonight that wonderful saying of chuck prince, as long as the music is playing you have to get up and dance but you have to ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, who was playing the music. %$* 158
you know, it’s so easy, to heap opprobrium on wall street right now. %$* 158
it’s just too easy. %$* 158
and if you noticed, that’s exactly what the politicians do. %$* 158
i couldn’t help but notice, in president obama’s inaugural address, an allusion to greed, and irresponsibility. %$* 158
and only yesterday, he was denouncing, and i quote, “the recklessness and greed of the bonuses paid to executives at the insurance company aig.” it was just the same in the last great depression, i think of this as the slight depression. %$* 158
fdr in his inaugural address, heaped scorn on the rulers of the exchange and the unscrupulous money-changers. %$* 158
ladies and gentlemen, you have to ask yourselves %$* 158
why do the politicians always wax so indignant about finance at times like these? %$* 158
could it just possibly be that they’re trying to divert our attention away from washington’s own responsibility for the debacle? %$* 158
what i want to do in the brief time i have available is to invite you to consider the roles played by four institutions, in bringing about this financial crisis, and i also want you to reflect on the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) location of those institutions. %$* 158
the first is the federal reserve board. %$* 158
its role has been to allow a housing bubble to inflate, and burst, between january of 2001 and june of 2003, the fed cut its federal funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. %$* 158
then over three years it very gradually, by quarter- points, raised rates up to 5.25 percent. %$* 158
in that time, ladies and gentlemen, house price inflation in this country, rose from 7 percent, to 17 percent a year, and it stayed above 15 percent a year, right until january of 2006. %$* 158
this was the period when ben bernanke, chairman of the fed, proclaimed the advent of a great moderation, in economic life, yes, that was the title of his lecture in 2004.“some moderation.” the location of the federal reserve board, is the eccles building, constitution avenue, washington d.c.the second institution, that i’d like to draw your attention to is the securities and exchange commission, which under christopher cox, allowed the leverage in the banking system to spiral out of all control, from some 12 to 1, to as we’ve already heard this evening somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 to 1, in the case of the big investment banks. %$* 158
and that was a conscious decision by the sec.the location of the sec, ladies and gentlemen, 100 f street northwest, washington, d.c.my third prime suspect is congress, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 158
yes, congress because it was “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) congress that wholly failed to supervise fannie mae, and freddie mac. %$* 158
those two essential institutions, which underpin the united states mortgage market. %$* 158
on the eve of their destruction, fannie and freddie had core capital, as defined by their regulator, of $83 billion, and supported around $5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees. %$* 158
in other words they were leveraged 65-to-1.the location of the congress, i’m sure you’re aware of this but i can’t help but point it out is capitol hill, washington d.c.and that brings me to another nearby location—the location of the white house. %$* 158
you know the white house played an extremely important role in creating the sub-prime mortgage disaster. %$* 158
“we want everybody in america to own their own home,” declared president george w. bush, in october in 2002. everybody, in america. %$* 158
he challenged lenders to create 5.5 million new minority homeowners, by the end of the decade. %$* 158
he signed the american dream down payment act, in 2003.no presidential pressure, no sub-prime debacle. %$* 158
the address of the white house, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 1600 pennsylvania avenue northwest, washington d.c.well, ladies and gentlemen, bankers are nearly always actuated by greed, so, i’m sad to say, are many ordinary “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) people too. %$* 158
but it’s the role of government to strike a balance, between market forces, and stability. %$* 158
and i move in conclusion, that we should blame washington more than wall street, for this crisis. %$* 158
not least because in my view, washington sold itself to wall street. %$* 158
and i very much fear, is still in hock to it. %$* 158
i beg to propose this motion. %$* 158
thank you, niall ferguson, arguing for the motion. %$* 13
now to argue against the motion, i’d like to introduce alex berenson. %$* 13
alex berenson is a reporter for the new york times who has covered a wide range of stories and issues, he’s been to iraq, he has been to new orleans to report on the effects of hurricane katrina, but he— %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
louder? %$* 137
shall i start again, could you not hear anything? %$* 159
sorry? %$* 159
the speaker the speaker we can’t hear the speaker. %$* 137
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i haven’t said anything yet. %$* 160
oh— he wasn’t talking yet. %$* 13
but how did that happen? %$* 13
my mouth was moving. %$* 13
alex berenson is a journalist for the new york times who has covered the aftermath of hurricane katrina and iraq, but he’s most known and most relevant in this debate for his investigative work on wall street and, alex, you are a novelist as well, i should point out, i don’t know if you could make up the situation we’re in now. %$* 13
but here’s alex berenson to argue against the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” %$* 13
thank you, i hope you can all hear me,— i see a lot of green out there tonight, which is fitting on two levels. %$* 160
it’s also st. %$* 160
patrick’s day, another festival of wretched excess that will lead to some hangovers tomorrow. %$* 160
and i have to say i’m at a great disadvantage because, niall ferguson has that accent, he could read the phone book to you and it would sound a lot smarter than i do. %$* 160
but before i get “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) going i want to quickly address something that niall said— niall was talking a lot about institutions that were involved with residential home finance. %$* 160
and there’s no doubt that mortgages, residential mortgages are a huge part of this crisis. %$* 160
but the two banks that have collapsed in the last year, the two wall street banks that have effectively collapsed in the last year, lehman and bear, really weren’t all that involved in the residential mortgage finance business, they— not to say they weren’t involved but they weren’t as involved as a lot of other people. %$* 160
and the reason i point that out is because, the issues here, are a lot larger than fannie and freddie or the home price bubble, as significant as that is. %$* 160
so let me, let me start by going back to the resolution which, the resolution doesn’t say, we need more regulation going forward, i don’t think anyone on this panel, anyone in this room would disagree with that. %$* 160
and the resolution doesn’t say that bankers should all be put on a desert island and forced to make their own society. %$* 160
you know, i guess that’s the hamptons but— sorry, jim. %$* 160
but— but what the resolution says is, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” and that is flat wrong. %$* 160
and to understand why, like niall, i wanna take you back to the depression, and to the creation of the sec. now, the depression was the last time “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) that there was this kind of public anger at wall street and at big business in the united states, and understandably so. %$* 160
and when the roosevelt administration created the sec, one of the things that they considered doing, briefly, was having the sec have the power to prevent companies from selling shares, not because they were committing fraud or misrepresenting their financial statements, but simply because the sec’s economic experts would find, well, this company doesn’t have very good prospects. %$* 160
this company has too much competition. %$* 160
we’re not gonna let them sell shares. %$* 160
and that idea didn’t go very far, it was very rapidly rejected, but it was considered. %$* 160
but what—why i think this is so important and interesting is it shows that even during the depression, even during a time when unemployment was 25 percent and there were breadlines and there was really a question about whether capitalism could work, and there—you know, there was an alternative model that seemed to be working in the soviet union— even then the united states went with a relatively permissive, regulatory regime. %$* 160
and that’s always been our history. %$* 160
and to me, that makes sense, and if you think about your own life, if you think about your own business as you know, whether you’re a lawyer or a doctor or whether you work in retail, whether “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) you—a landlord, whatever it is that you may do, you probably have a better idea where the opportunities are, but also where the problems are, where you can take advantage of your customers, where you can cut corners, than any regulator could no matter closely they monitored you. %$* 160
it’s your business, it’s your life. %$* 160
and so the regulator needs to set the rules, but in the end—you succeed or fail on your own. %$* 160
and think about the commercial airline industry in the united states, which is really a great success story in the most important way which is that it’s extremely safe. %$* 160
you can count the number of jet crashes this decade on one hand, in the united states. %$* 160
and, you know, we’re going towards zero. %$* 160
and i don’t think that’s because the faa is a better regulator than the fda or the sec, or anyone else, i think it’s because there’s a commitment in the airline industry to safety. %$* 160
now whether they define that as a moral issue, we need to protect our passengers and our workers, or whether it’s a practical issue where they believe there might not be economic repercussions, people might not wanna fly if there were too many crashes, i don’t know. %$* 160
but there’s no question that the airline industry in the united states is extremely safe. %$* 160
and i think it’s not a result of the faa, i think it’s a result of a commitment within the industry. %$* 160
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) compare that to wall street, which appears to have been run by a bunch of greedy children, for the last 10 years. %$* 160
and greed is a crucial word there, because although niall sort of—you know, he mentioned the compensation and then skated past it. %$* 160
compensation is a crucial, crucial part of understanding what went wrong on wall street in the last 10 years. %$* 160
when you can make a million or 10 million or in some cases $100 million for a year’s work, you don’t have very much incentive to run your business for the long term. %$* 160
if you can %$* 160
if theoretically, you’re being paid in stock, and your compensation is gonna be restricted over a long time, you have more incentive. %$* 160
but even so if the numbers are really, really large, it’s unlikely that you’re going to think long-term. %$* 160
and so i think jim now will talk to you about some of the specifics of what went wrong on wall street in the last 10 years. %$* 160
but, at its core, the issue is relatively simple, there was a huge amount of leverage taken, there was inadequate capital to support the risks that the banks were taking. %$* 160
when you make loans, some of them are gonna go bad, and you need to have enough money in capital, in equity, to handle those losses, and the banks simply didn’t have that. %$* 160
now, did washington create the conditions that allowed that to happen, sure. %$* 160
could we and should we have had a much more robust “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) regulatory system? %$* 160
absolutely. %$* 160
regulation is vital, regulation sets the playing field, it sets the rules. %$* 160
but in the end, you have to put blame where blame is due. %$* 160
and, blame is due on the firms. %$* 160
it’s due on the owners, it’s due on the managers, it’s due on the executives, it’s due on the employees. %$* 160
to some extent, although to a lesser extent it’s due on shareholders because the shareholders didn’t properly manage the boards of directors but that’s something nell can talk about. %$* 160
but in the end, blame accrues to wall street, not washington, please keep that in mind, and vote against this resolution. %$* 160
thank you. %$* 160
thank you, alex berenson, speaking against the motion, now to speak for the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” i’d like to introduce john gordon steele, a man who’s a little bit difficult to pin down, he is an adventurer, he has spent time in politics, he’s been a filmmaker, he has been an npr commentator and still is, but it’s as an author of books focusing on critical periods in financial history that he comes to us today with expertise to argue for the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” ladies and gentlemen, john gordon steele. %$* 13
i’m sorry %$* 13
i’m gonna correct that, ladies and gentlemen, john steele gordon. %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) %$* 13
the british always wanna file me under steele-gordon, with a hyphen. %$* 161
i only use my middle name because john gordon is about as blah a name as you can find. %$* 161
i’m here to argue that washington is more at fault than wall street, although as everybody has admitted, wall street has plenty of blame to take here. %$* 161
but %$* 161
wall street is not unitary. %$* 161
wall street is nothing but a metonym for the american financial market, and it operates around the globe and %$* 161
nowadays, deep down into the socioeconomic spectrum. %$* 161
now some of the people who are encompassed by the term “wall street” have fiduciary obligations to their stockholders or to their depositors. %$* 161
but the majority of, of wall streeters do not. %$* 161
they are operating entirely for themselves in their self-interest. %$* 161
washington on the other hand, has nothing but fiduciaries, i mean that’s why governments are instituted among men, no other reason. %$* 161
now, wall street because it is entirely inhabited by people who are pursuing their self-interest, it’s notorious that there are only two emotions to be found on wall street, fear and greed. %$* 161
right now i think it’s perhaps time to put in a good word for greed. %$* 161
as a result, we have had panics on wall street roughly every 20 years. %$* 161
now “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) the constitution came into effect in april of 1789, we had the first crash on wall street in april of 1792. then we had another one 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, 1987, and now 2008. it seems to be just part of the beast, i mean could any of these panics have been prevented by wall street? %$* 161
i doubt it. %$* 161
being individuals, and wall street is nothing but a collection of individuals, not an institution, it is inherently susceptible to the madness of crowds. %$* 161
so, blaming wall street is like blaming the atmosphere for thunderstorms, it’s the nature of the beast, it’s going to happen. %$* 161
washington on the other hand is supposed to be the guys with the striped shirts and the whistles on the playing field. %$* 161
they make up the rules, and then they enforce them. %$* 161
and then they sometimes change the rules in order to accommodate some of their friends. %$* 161
also alan greenspan famously said, that it is—part of the federal reserve’s job is to take away the punchbowl when the party really gets going. %$* 161
in other words it’s washington’s job to prevent the crowd from going mad. %$* 161
they’ve just done an incredibly lousy job of regulating wall street or preventing the madness of crowds. %$* 161
i mean for one thing the regulatory apparatus is a total shambles. %$* 161
i mean we have the federal reserve, we have the controller of “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) the currency, we have the sec, we have the office of thrift supervision. %$* 161
we have the fdic.we have the banking regulatory authorities of the 50 states. %$* 161
all of them bureaucracies, all of them devoted as all bureaucrats are to protecting turf, far and head of, of actually regulating anything. %$* 161
now, also, politicians are subject to human nature, the same as wall streets are. %$* 161
if wall streeters are in the business of making money, politicians are in the reelection business. %$* 161
that means that they’re gonna be short term-oriented, they’re gonna—what they want is the good headline tomorrow morning, and if that produces dreadful policy two or three or five years out, that’s after the election, we’ll worry about it then. %$* 161
everybody knows that publicly-traded corporations have to submit annual reports, that these reports have to be according to standardized accounting rules, and that they have to be certified as being honest and complete by independent accountants. %$* 161
this is a great idea. %$* 161
it’s now so obvious that nobody even thinks about it anymore, but it was invented by wall street. %$* 161
because the great wall street banks in the late 19th century, they wanted to know what the corporations were really up to, and so did the members of the new york stock exchange. %$* 161
so the corporation screamed bloody murder at first, but the wall street banks said sorry, if you want us to underwrite your securities, you’re gonna “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) have to do this, and the new york stock exchange says if you want your securities listed with us, you’re gonna have to do it, so they finally did it. %$* 161
there’s still one great big player in the financial world in the united states, that is not subject to these commonsense rules. %$* 161
it’s called the government. %$* 161
for instance, you remember those budget surpluses in the later years of the clinton administration between 1998 and 2001? %$* 161
they amounted to $558 billion. %$* 161
so the national debt went down by $558 billion, right? %$* 161
uh, no, it went up by $400 billion. %$* 161
the reason is that social security was put on budget. %$* 161
and that means that the revenues that flow into social security over and above what is paid out to recipients of social security becomes part of the government revenue, it’s called an intra-governmental transfer. %$* 161
of course the money that’s taken out of the social security trust fund is replaced with newly minted federal bonds. %$* 161
which is why the debt went up. %$* 161
now, if a private company or publicly-traded company, tried to take employee contributions to the company pension fund, and call it revenue in order to perk up the bottom line, the managers of that corporation would all this very minute be playing volleyball in club fed. %$* 161
or, consider fannie and freddie. %$* 161
it was a great—fannie was a great idea, it sounded, in 1938-- %$* 161
and it really, it liquefied the mortgage market, it helped, along with the gi bill tremendously, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) to increase home ownership, and i’m gonna have to quit here i’m afraid. %$* 161
i have to interrupt you. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
but for the introduction i’d like to—i’d like to give you the shot at being applauded twice because, for the radio broadcast since i made the error on your name i’d like to reintroduce you and have everybody applaud for you again, and you can enjoy that. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome john steele gordon. %$* 13
i’m really sorry for that, let’s look at where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through our opening remarks, i’m your moderator, john donvan, we are hearing from two teams of three debaters each, arguing this motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” we are now going to hear from the next debater against the motion. %$* 13
jim chanos is the founder and managing partner of kynikos associates. %$* 13
he has had a successful period let us say because, he is a man who bets against the market. %$* 13
recently a very successful period, i don’t know, jim, in this situation, are congratulations in order— but, i welcome you to our debate, ladies and gentlemen, jim chanos. %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) thank you, john, and thank you to robert and to intelligence squared for putting on this great series and heightening the public debate on these important issues. %$* 162
i think you’re doing great, great work, thank you. %$* 162
now, we’ve heard from two-thirds of the “for” team’s members, and from my august teammate, mr. %$* 162
berenson. %$* 162
and, we all seem to be missing sight of the resolution. %$* 162
again, no one seems to disagree that more regulation is needed. %$* 162
no one seems to disagree, that crimes, malfeasance, and incompetence, were at work. %$* 162
the question is who’s more to blame. %$* 162
and i hope to be able to make my point, that in fact that’s gonna be pretty easy to point out. %$* 162
before i got here i was searching the web for instances of irish wit when it comes to financial markets and money. %$* 162
now my mother was mary catherine sullivan, and as much as i— i tried hard to find examples of that wit, i came a cropper. %$* 162
so i had to turn to another great philosopher, in all matters economic. %$* 162
tony soprano. %$* 162
who went imploring his gang to work harder, ‘cause not enough money was coming in to keep everybody happy, said “look, we don’t got one of them enron things here.” this is important. %$* 162
because, i would like to go on to “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) tell you that agency risk as it exists in corporate america is legion. %$* 162
it is endemic, and it is pervasive. %$* 162
in 1998 business week put out a survey, after, canvassing 500 of the s&p 500 chief financial officers anonymously. %$* 162
and they were asked in the celebrated question, “how many of you have ever been asked by your superior to materially falsify financial results.” and the answer was stunning. %$* 162
45 percent said they were asked to do so but didn’t, 12 percent said they were asked to do, and did, and 33 percent said they were never asked. %$* 162
so at the time, 10 years ago, two thirds of our nation’s largest cfo’s had basically been asked to cook the books. %$* 162
and luckily, only a minority did so. %$* 162
and lest you think this was an outlier, the same survey roughly, was repeated by cfo magazine six months later, and had very, very similar results. %$* 162
it’s the main reason i have a business that i feel will continue to prosper no matter what the markets do. %$* 162
because quite frankly out there, there’s a lotta people in the public markets that wanna take your money. %$* 162
and that, ladies and gentleman, is a point i think that we are going to carry tonight. %$* 162
how did we get, in the last five years, when things seemed to escalate so much, so much worse on the fraud side, from enron, tyco and rogue analysts, to the world of bear sterns, lehman brothers, aig, bernie madoff, and stanford financial. %$* 162
well %$* 162
i think the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) reason we have, is that those in charge, yes, they may have fallen asleep. %$* 162
yes, they may have done dereliction of duty. %$* 162
but we saw a level of compensation, and a new structure of structured finance that allowed, as alex pointed out, undreamed-of amounts of leverage, and skewed incentives for compensation. %$* 162
it was heads i win, tails, my shareholders lose. %$* 162
every trading desk had a mantra of making their numbers in one way, shape, form or another, and did so quite easily in all kinds of markets in the last five to 10 years, up, down, whatever. %$* 162
it was not just madoff who produced stunning consistent and profitable results. %$* 162
if you look at the profits as bob rosenkranz alluded to in his opening statement, of our largest banks and brokers, no matter what the markets did, many of these firms returned 20 to 30 percent on equity, quarter in, quarter out, with very little variability of operations. %$* 162
how did that happen. %$* 162
well, they were gaming the system. %$* 162
remember sarbanes-oxley? %$* 162
i do, i got all kinds of phone calls from the press after sarbanes-oxley saying well you don’t have a job anymore. %$* 162
short selling will never be profitable. %$* 162
yes, corporate malfeasance will be a thing of the past. %$* 162
because ceo’s and cfo’s now have to sign the financial statements. %$* 162
and if something goes wrong, they could go to jail. %$* 162
and when i pointed out to those same journalists that falsifying “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) financial statements has always been a crime, and this just simply codified it a little tighter. %$* 162
well, this is post- enron, people are going to be vigilant, and accountants and lawyers will not let this happen. %$* 162
ladies and gentlemen, i will pose to you that there has not been one major financial fraud in the past 25 years, uncovered by the government, outside auditors, or outside counsel. %$* 162
it’s always been journalists, whistle-blowers, or short sellers, or some combination thereof. %$* 162
daresay, that if bernie madoff had been public, the shorts would’ve found him out a long time ago. %$* 162
now, post- sarbanes-oxley, post-enron, we had to move to tougher accounting standards. %$* 162
we saw faz 46 get brought in, and i’m not gonna bog you down in arcane but it basically said, keeping things off the balance sheet is no longer kosher. %$* 162
part of the problem with enron as you recall were the funds that were offshore that an enron cfo was general partner of while he was still undertaking his duties as enron cfo. %$* 162
well, guess who lobbied for a big exemption, of those rules. %$* 162
the banks and brokers, who got fin 46-r enacted which was, financial institutions were exempt, from the consolidation of offshore entities and unconsolidated entities, hiding large amounts of assets and liabilities. %$* 162
imagine that. %$* 162
and while we’re at it let’s talk about professor ferguson’s locus of problems. %$* 162
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) well the fed, yeah, the fed’s located in washington, there’s no doubt about that. %$* 162
but the part of the fed that is instructed to be the market cop, is the new york fed. %$* 162
now the new york fed for the past few years was run by the current treasury secretary. %$* 162
but do you know who sits on the board of the new york fed and do you know who it answers to. %$* 162
bet very few of you do. %$* 162
the largest commercial banks in the united states. %$* 162
jim chanos, i have to cut you off, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, jim chanos. %$* 13
now to argue for the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” i’d like to introduce nouriel roubini %$* 13
known, i think we all know, as dr. %$* 13
doom. %$* 13
having predicted much of what has happened a few years back, having a name like that only really works out if you turn out to be correct. %$* 13
so far so good, dr. %$* 13
doom, ladies and gentlemen, nouriel roubini. %$* 13
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 163
i say the beginning i support the proposition, i blame more washington, than wall street for this financial crisis, but i should say the beginning, that i do agree that wall streeters, bankers, traders, investors, are greedy. %$* 163
sometimes they are stupid, they are arrogant, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) they’re incompetent. %$* 163
they take too much risk, they take too much leverage, they are over compensated, all that’s true. %$* 163
but we’ve had the worst financial crisis since the great depression, we have to ask ourselves, are bankers and investors more greedy and more immoral than they were 20 years ago. %$* 163
20 years ago, gordon gekko in wall street said that greed is good. %$* 163
i don’t think that has changed, you know, we know there is always greed, actually greed in some sense is good, is one of the drivers of capitalism. %$* 163
but we know that greed has to be controlled by three things. %$* 163
by fear of losses, by the fact they should not expect to be bailed out, and by a system of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system because financial markets without ruling institutions are like the law of the jungle. %$* 163
and that’s to me the failure, i expect wall street to be greedy but i expect good policy-making, trying to control the behavior, and that did not happen. %$* 163
in many dimensions. %$* 163
the fed and greenspan, after the last tech bubble went bust, cut interest rates almost to zero, and created the asset bubble, kept interest rates too low for too long. %$* 163
was most at that time, people talked about the greenspan put in financial markets, it was the expectation whenever trouble occurs, greenspan’s gonna ease things and get you out of your losses and problems. %$* 163
it happened after the 1987 stock market crash and the s&l crisis easing, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) then in the ‘90s with the tech bubble, greenspan warned about irrational exuberance and did nothing about it. %$* 163
and after the tech bubble went bust, he cut interest rates from 6.5 down to 1 percent, and he created the latest bubble. %$* 163
so, he has been a creator of serial bubbles one after the other and when people expect to be bailed out then they behave accordingly, that’s the greenspan truth. %$* 163
we created a system which people expect, that the gains are going to be privatized, and the losses are going to be socialized; this is a welfare state for the rich, for the well-connected and for wall street. %$* 163
that’s what happened, that’s public policy. %$* 163
the action of the fed regarding the asset bubble, was, you don’t do anything on the way up, that was the official rule of greenspan, don kohn, and ben bernanke, and when the asset bubble collapses, to avoid the collateral damage to the real economy, you ease aggressively. %$* 163
again, that’s a buyer’s behavior that creates more and more bubbles. %$* 163
we’re running out of bubbles actually to create, with the real estate bubble, the tech bubble, the hedge fund bubble, the private equity bubble, you know, even the commodity bubble, the art bubble, we’re running out of bubbles to create but we’re easing again down to zero so, what’s gonna happen this time around. %$* 163
as was pointed out, the job of the fed is to take away the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) punchbowl when the party gets going but unfortunately not only the fed did not take away the punchbowl, it added vodka, whiskey, gin, and every toxic stuff to it. %$* 163
and it made the bubble even bigger. %$* 163
take the role of the fed and the regulators, with sub-prime mortgages %$* 163
greenspan was the biggest cheerleader of this kind of financial innovation. %$* 163
zero down payment, no verification of income, assets and jobs, they called them ninja loans or liar loans. %$* 163
interest-only mortgages, negative amortization, teaser rates, all this toxic stuff or sub- prime, near-prime, prime. %$* 163
the fed and greenspan actively said was the best thing that have happened to mortgages. %$* 163
free market, they could control it, they had the law, the power to do it, they didn’t do it. %$* 163
think about our public policy towards housing and mortgages. %$* 163
the community reinvestment act, creation of fannie and freddie-subsidized housing. %$* 163
the 20 ways in which we have subsidized, through tax policy, interested community of mortgages. %$* 163
the worst, and the most unproductive form of investment, investment in housing. %$* 163
big mcmansion can give you utility but doesn’t increase the stock of capital in the real way of productivity of capital and labor, like, physical capital does. %$* 163
we have subsidized housing in 20 different ways. %$* 163
that has led to the bubble as well. %$* 163
there was an ideology for the last decade in “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) washington, that was critical to this financial crisis. %$* 163
was an ideology of laissez-faire, wild west unregulated capitalists. %$* 163
the base of this ideology was the idea that banks and financial institutions will self-regulate. %$* 163
and as we know, self-regulation means no regulation. %$* 163
it was the ideology of relying on market discipline, and we know when there is irrational exuberance, there is zero market discipline. %$* 163
there was an ideology, and policies of relying on an internal risk- management model and as was pointed out, chuck prince said, when the music is playing you gotta stand up and dance, nobody listens in good times to the risk managers, they’re the party poopers, only the risk takers have the advantage in the banks, and therefore, relying on internal risk management doesn’t work. %$* 163
was relying on rating agencies that had massive conflicts of interest because of being paid by those they are supposed to be rating. %$* 163
and this rating agency had a quasi-governmental role. %$* 163
they had monopoly or oligopoly power, and power to decide whose assets you can buy or not buy, that was policy that led them to have that power, and those kind of distortions. %$* 163
so every element of our regulatory system, has failed, you know, this basel accord that relied on this principle, has failed even before it was implemented. %$* 163
relying on principle rather than “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) rules, relying on light touch, rather than tough rules, a light touch means no touch at all. %$* 163
the ideology of greenspan was, every financial innovation is great, markets self-regulate. %$* 163
shareholders are gonna be able to control the behavior of bankers and so on. %$* 163
this was the belief in deregulation. %$* 163
elements of it, actions were taken. %$* 163
the repeal of glass-steagall that separated investment banking from commercial banking. %$* 163
now we let them essentially, use deposit insurance and deposits to do 30 times leverage prop trading, that’s what was allowed. %$* 163
essentially deregulation of credit derivatives and derivatives, over the counter with systemic risk. %$* 163
things of that sort were going on. %$* 163
the sec deciding the level ratios, 30 to 1 was okay. %$* 163
those were the policy that led then to those excesses. %$* 163
there is greed, it is up to public policy to make sure that greed is controlled because otherwise if you don’t have rules, institutions, and balance and prudential regulation supervision, is the law of the jungle, and unfortunately the last element of it was regulatory capture. %$* 163
it was an ideology in which, the government power taken over and controlled by lobbies where those were pushing for this kind of deregulation. %$* 163
so it was a massive failure of public policy, thank you. %$* 163
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) thank you, nouriel roubini. %$* 13
finally to speak against the motion, nell minow who is an attorney who has held positions in various government agencies but she’s best known and again most relevant in this debate, for having run a firm which held corporate ceo’s to strict accountability, she was described by fortune magazine as “the ceo killer.” and i know we have some ceo’s in the room, nell, so this is not literal, is it. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nell minow. %$* 13
only when they deserve it. %$* 164
you’ve got to vote for our side. %$* 164
i have to tell you, you know, there’s plenty of blame to go around, we all agree, there’s plenty of blame to go around. %$* 164
you know, there’s washington, there’s wall street, but all of us know who really is to blame here, it’s gotta be jim cramer. %$* 164
listen, i’m willing to blame everybody, i’m even willing to blame that bachelor guy, i— everybody, everybody deserves— it takes a village to create this problem. %$* 164
or put it another way i’m gonna quote pogo, who said, “we have met the enemy and he is us,” every one of us bears some responsibility for what went on here but i’m gonna tell you today, why it’s wall street that is primarily responsible. %$* 164
first of all, it’s a bit of a false distinction, between wall street and “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) washington. %$* 164
and one of the things i’m going to talk about today is how inextricably they are linked. %$* 164
we talk about fannie and freddie. %$* 164
those were public corporations, after all. %$* 164
they were a little bit the better, the worst of both worlds, a little bit of a duck billed platypus because they had a little government edge there. %$* 164
but those were public corporations with boards of directors and they behaved like public corporations. %$* 164
they behaved badly. %$* 164
and that is what is wrong with wall street. %$* 164
so you may noticed already, even in this few minutes that i’ve been up here, i’m different. %$* 164
i’m not like anybody else on this panel and that is why, and the primary difference, as i’m sure you’ve noticed, is i’m the only one on the panel who is from washington. %$* 164
i have to say, none of these people know anything about washington except some addresses. %$* 164
that’s all we know. %$* 164
i see he’s got a gps, is all he’s got. %$* 164
and you know, and the other thing is, i’m not an economist. %$* 164
i am a capitalist. %$* 164
i, uniquely on this panel, i have created businesses. %$* 164
i have created businesses, had them grow and sold them. %$* 164
i have worried about making a payroll. %$* 164
so i know something. %$* 164
i’m not like an economist who, it works in theory, it doesn’t work in practice. %$* 164
so i know what it is to be a capitalist. %$* 164
and i know what it is to be a bureaucrat. %$* 164
i worked in the government. %$* 164
in the reagan administration i was at omb. and let me tell you, one of “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) the big shocks in my life was all these people who espouse and rhapsodize about the free market kept trooping over to me to get me to give them limits on liability and erect barriers to entry. %$* 164
everybody is all about the free market except when it benefits them not to be. %$* 164
so i’m going to tell you the three things that wall street did that are unforgivable and that really weigh the balance in favor of their responsibility. %$* 164
what is the one thing we want from wall street? %$* 164
we want just one thing. %$* 164
we want them to be able to do math, right? %$* 164
the math was wrong. %$* 164
their math was bad. %$* 164
they put too much reliance on something called the gaussian copula formula. %$* 164
yes, the gaussian copula formula is at the heart of what created the derivative securities, the credit default swaps. %$* 164
they all relied on it. %$* 164
they all got on one leaky little boat. %$* 164
they didn’t take out their slide rules. %$* 164
they didn’t do the math. %$* 164
so they relied on bad statistics. %$* 164
they left out one big variable. %$* 164
yes, they heard music, but what dance were they doing? %$* 164
they heard music for the minuet. %$* 164
they were doing the boogie, okay? %$* 164
and what is the address of all of those forms? %$* 164
i believe it’s on wall street. %$* 164
second thing, bad incentives. %$* 164
they were getting paid based on the quantity of transactions, not the quality of transactions. %$* 164
now, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that’s going to “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) have a very bad result. %$* 164
look at what we’ve seen about the pay just in the last couple of days. %$* 164
look at the new york post with its headline today: aig is a p-i-g.these people were getting paid regardless of what happened. %$* 164
you heard about anthony mozilo? %$* 164
six hundred million dollars as he took the stock down seventy-eight per cent and took the economy down with it. %$* 164
fuld didn’t have to give any of it back. %$* 164
i testified with fuld before congress in washington when they called him in to account. %$* 164
and he said, up until last year the performance was pretty good. %$* 164
so he should be allowed to keep all that money. %$* 164
only thirteen percent of companies on wall street have claw backs, meaning they have to give back the money when the numbers that were reported, that they got their bonuses on, turn out to be wrong. %$* 164
that is on wall street. %$* 164
what are they doing now? %$* 164
watch them carefully. %$* 164
they are repricing their options. %$* 164
that is disgusting. %$* 164
and that is wall street. %$* 164
okay, next. %$* 164
terrible oversight as shareholders. %$* 164
yes, the shareholders should have done more. %$* 164
guess who the big shareholders are? %$* 164
yeah, they’re on wall street. %$* 164
who was it that was voting in favor of these insane pay packages? %$* 164
well, look at the firms on wall street. %$* 164
they’re the big shareholders. %$* 164
they’re managing all that money. %$* 164
they are enablers for the addiction of bad pay packages on wall street. %$* 164
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) and yeah, washington behaved badly. %$* 164
washington behaved very badly. %$* 164
do you think the fact that from 1998 to 2008 over six hundred million dollars was spent on lobbying to get rid of regulations, like glass-steagall, to get rid of capital requirements on banks – do you think maybe that might have had an effect on it? %$* 164
yeah, washington is nice to its friends. %$* 164
who is responsible for that? %$* 164
who are its friends? %$* 164
i would like wall street to make the same disclaimer that is required of mutual funds. %$* 164
past performance is no guarantee of future performance. %$* 164
and who is it that requires them to say that? %$* 164
that is washington. %$* 164
wall street has expected us to bet on them for a long time. %$* 164
they have not lived up to our trust in them and they are more responsible than washington for this mess. %$* 164
thank you. %$* 164
thank you, nell. %$* 13
you know, and that concludes round one, opening remarks of this debate. %$* 13
we had you vote when you came in, vote on whether you side with the motion, against the motion or are undecided. %$* 13
and we have the first results from that first vote. %$* 13
restating the motion: blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis, forty-two percent of you vote for this motion, thirty percent vote against and twenty-eight percent remain undecided. %$* 13
we’ll poll you again at the end of the evening “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) and the team that moves most votes, the team that changes most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so we’re now going to move on to round two and in round two the debaters talk to each other directly and they also take questions from us. %$* 13
so on to round two. %$* 13
and i just want to ask niall ferguson, since your side is arguing that wall street should be blamed for the economic crisis and we heard your ca. %$* 13
i’m sorry, washington should be blamed for the economic crisis. %$* 13
and we heard your teammates say that washington did not do its job well. %$* 13
my question really is, if washington had performed its job well, would we have an economic crisis? %$* 13
well, i think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the united states. %$* 158
now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here. %$* 158
but they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis. %$* 158
you don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated. %$* 158
that country is called canada. %$* 158
so if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the united states. %$* 158
and that is our central point. %$* 158
it’s not difficult to see that “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here. %$* 158
you only have to look north of the border. %$* 158
nell minow, you’re on the opposite side of the, of the argument but i see you nodding. %$* 13
well. %$* 164
that’s always a good sign. %$* 158
you know, the fact is that the banks are supposed to be able to respond to whatever is provided for them in some kind of a rational way. %$* 164
and they didn’t do. %$* 164
as i said, they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers. %$* 164
but i’m not sure that i think that more regulation is the answer. %$* 164
is that what you’re arguing for? %$* 164
on the contrary. %$* 158
i’ve never said i’m in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation. %$* 158
well, in what way is it better? %$* 164
can i conclude my point? %$* 158
if you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis. %$* 158
i’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the u.k.and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious. %$* 158
certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though i don’t rule out that this is going to get worse. %$* 158
so, no, i’m not in favor of more regulation. %$* 158
the heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the great depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign. %$* 158
the trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess. %$* 158
this, i think, is the point that john steele gordon, nouriel roubini and i want to stress. %$* 158
and it’s not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the u.s. was so bad. %$* 158
but don’t you think the fact, the point that i made about six hundred million dollars being poured into washington, they don’t have that system in canada, either, for lobbying and for political campaign fundraising. %$* 164
but you understate the case. %$* 163
nouriel roubini, let’s let nouriel roubini come in and respond. %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis. %$* 163
you know, after the great depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system, capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises. %$* 163
it’s not just the u.s.if you look around, for the last twenty years, you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries. %$* 163
and what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with ronald reagan and then margaret thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets. %$* 163
now, some deregulation was good. %$* 163
nobody is in favor of excess. %$* 163
even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the great depression and that led to not enough financial innovation. %$* 163
but deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in east asia, like in mexico, like in argentina and so on. %$* 163
and therefore, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs. %$* 163
there’s a trade off between the two, but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) occurring now more frequently. %$* 163
these should occur once every thousand years. %$* 163
now occur every other year – more frequently, more virulent and more costly in every way. %$* 163
alex berenson, from the other side. %$* 13
certainly there has been a huge amount of deregulation in the last twenty years. %$* 160
there’s also been major changes in the structure of wall street. %$* 160
firms, you know, wall street was essentially a set of partnerships, largely, until the seventies and by the nineties, i think, goldman was the last big firm to give up the partnership model. %$* 160
so, again, it’s not your capital at risk anymore. %$* 160
it’s your shareholders’ capital at risk. %$* 160
you don’t own your firm anymore, you own a portion of it. %$* 160
i don’t think it’s an accident that there are some small partnerships out there that have essentially thri-- %$* 160
well, thrive may be too strong a word. %$* 160
but they have survived this crisis. %$* 160
the other very, very important change, really the most important change, is the egregious increase in compensation. %$* 160

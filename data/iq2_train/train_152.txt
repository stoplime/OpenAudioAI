as some of you know, he got rid of the retirement test on social security. %$* 15
if you were between the ages of 65 and 72, every dollar you earned in social security-- %$* 15
is earned, you lost 50 cents in social security benefits. %$* 15
clinton got rid of that. %$* 15
if you look at it, clinton reappointed reagan's fed chairman twice, brought the long-term bond yield way, way down. %$* 15
i thought that was spectacular. %$* 15
if you look at what clinton did, he passed welfare reform, signed into law welfare reform, that you actually have to look for a job to get welfare. %$* 15
now, there's a concept. %$* 15
clinton also had the biggest capital gains tax cut in our nation's history. %$* 15
if you know, he exempted-- %$* 15
got rid of all capital gains taxes on owner-occupied homes, couples and-- %$* 15
i mean virtually all. %$* 15
if you look at clinton, the one thing i really like most of all about bill clinton is he cut government spending as a share of gdp by the largest amount of any american president ever. %$* 15
in fact, it was he cut it by four times-- %$* 15
by as much as the next four best presidents combined. %$* 15
there is a supply side president, in my view. %$* 15
yes, he did raise tax rates on the-- %$* 15
he did raise tax rates. %$* 15
that was the one mistake he made. %$* 15
but all the rest were great. %$* 15
nouriel roubini. %$* 13
not only-- %$* 436
the first thing he did was to raise taxes because we had a huge budget deficit during the reagan bush years that was going to become a disaster. %$* 163
everybody, including you guys, said it's going to lead to an economic recession. %$* 163
then reducing the debt is-- %$* 163
reduced interest rates led to innovation, to private investment, rather than the government sucking resources, that led to growth. %$* 163
the reality is that every time the republicans are in power, the budget deficit becomes much larger because you cut taxes in a way that's unsustainable. %$* 163
you raise military spending, and you raise discretionary spending as much or more than the democrats. %$* 163
during the bush years, discretionary spending doubled. %$* 163
phil gramm. %$* 13
when ronald reagan was president, we had a deficit of $100 billion as far as the eye could see. %$* 435
the deficit today is $1.5 trillion. %$* 435
government spending has risen by 20 percent in two years. %$* 435
obama %$* 163
we are looking-- %$* 435
wait a minute, you had your time, let me have my time. %$* 435
let him speak, please, let him speak, okay? %$* 13
phil gramm speak. %$* 13
do you really think we can operate a country where 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes has to go pay interest on the debt? %$* 435
einstein was once asked, "what is the most powerful force in the universe? %$* 435
" he said, "the power of compound interest." and now we've got it working against every worker, and every taxpayer, and every consumer in america, every minute. %$* 435
can i ask a-- %$* 436
i don't see how you can sit there-- %$* 435
can i ask a question? %$* 436
and not be alarmed about that %$* 435
laura tyson. %$* 13
i would like to ask phil gramm a question, because if you-- %$* 436
your point about interest payments on the debt is unnerving, frightening, it does have to do with the fact that we came into a crisis with a large level of federal debt to gdp and it has gone up. %$* 436
i would like to ask the question of what you would like to cut, in very specific terms, very specific terms, and see whether those cuts conform with what the american people would like to cut. %$* 436
okay, first of all, ronald reagan eliminated three social security benefits in one vote. %$* 435
okay, so cutting social security, which the majority of americans-- %$* 436
all right, let's just take social security. %$* 435
do not want to do, cutting-- %$* 436
i will answer your question. %$* 435
okay. %$* 436
first of all, we're currently phasing-- %$* 435
but the majority of americans-- %$* 436
laura, at least let him do this. %$* 13
we're currently phasing the retirement age up to 67. given the lifespan changes in america, 22 years from now we're going to get to 67, we need to allow that to continue to rise to 70. it will affect nobody for the next 22 years, but it'll change america a lot. %$* 435
we index social security by the wage rate, not the price level. %$* 435
that's a mistake and it needs to stop. %$* 435
and we pay benefits based on your high three years of earning, not what you pay in the whole system. %$* 435
if you change those three things, you eliminate the long- term actuarial problem in social security. %$* 435
and what would i do about medicare? %$* 435
okay, can i-- %$* 436
yeah. %$* 436
i think people ought to have co-payments and deductibles based on their income. %$* 435
and i think everybody ought to have a co-payment and a deductible no matter how low their income is. %$* 435
with somebody like art, i think his deductible ought to be about $250,000 a year. %$* 435
and his co-payment after that ought to be 50 percent. %$* 435
all right, change. %$* 13
before the list gets too long, laura tyson. %$* 13
i actually could probably have a discussion with phil gramm on these issues, and i suspect we would probably come to some agreement. %$* 436
i think what's important about this debate is not the debate, sadly, that the country's really having. %$* 436
if you have a debate that says "big government is stifling the american spirit," it basically suggests that the problem is the government, not us. %$* 436
and if you ask people, and i've already said this, "are you willing to cut benefits or raise taxes to bring this cost situation under control? %$* 436
" the answer is no. %$* 436
so one of the things we actually have to do as public figures is to educate people. %$* 436
i think that phil gramm has put out some interesting ideas; i think that those are ideas which a lot of people would disagree with. %$* 436
i think that - - but nonetheless, those are the kinds of things we have to discuss, not some sort of fantasy about size of government, forget it-- %$* 436
about the particulars of the big programs that are driving the government debt. %$* 436
and on the issue of-- %$* 436
just on the issue of making social security solvent, the 75-year actuarial hole is basically the same size as the bush tax cuts. %$* 436
so there's a nice choice for people, all right? %$* 436
and remember, as nouriel said, going back to the clinton level tax rates would go back to levels of rates that coincided with the most prosperous peacetime period in u.s.economic history. %$* 436
so those are not tax rates that are going to stifle the american spirit. %$* 436
it is a way to pay for the actuarial shortfall of social security. %$* 436
you might not want to do it that way, but at least recognize, that's a choice. %$* 436
art laffer. %$* 13
yeah, first i'd like to ask nouriel not to quote me when it's incorrect. %$* 15
i never thought the clinton tax increases would lead to a recession, depression. %$* 15
never wrote it, never said it. %$* 15
i was a huge fan of bill clinton’s overall economic package. %$* 15
i didn’t think those rates were the right things to do but i didn’t. %$* 15
and i would agree with laura. %$* 15
i mean, come on. %$* 15
let’s go back to the clinton era. %$* 15
if you could bring government spending down to the share of gdp to where it was under clinton, i think i’d take that along with the other ones going there. %$* 15
i’d love to see freer trade. %$* 15
i mean you really can’t have a prosperous economy, people. %$* 15
you can’t when the government’s way overspending, when it’s raising tax rates, when it’s printing too much money, when it’s over-regulating the private sector and when it’s restricting the free-flow of goods and services. %$* 15
but what is the government here for, if you can put it in terms that we’ve heard tonight. %$* 13
do we want meat inspectors? %$* 13
do we want levees taken care of in new orleans? %$* 13
of course. %$* 15
do we want the roads taken care of? %$* 13
do we want the universities running? %$* 13
of course. %$* 15
so what is the definition for? %$* 13
when is it big and when is it too big? %$* 13
let me go first with this. %$* 15
when we talk-- %$* 15
you know, the question you asked laura which i think is the right question about taxes. %$* 15
i mean, what i’d do is what jerry brown did about taxes when he ran for president in 1992.i’d get rid of all federal taxes except for sin taxes, and have two flat-rate taxes, one on business net sales and one on personal and adjusted gross income. %$* 15
if you did that, you could have jerry brown flat tax of 13 percent. %$* 15
now if i remember correctly jerry was not a right-wing republican. %$* 15
did i miss that somewhere? %$* 15
no. %$* 436
but i did all of jerry’s tax-- %$* 15
first place, make the tax codes efficient so you don’t have all the loop holes and everything to get around them. %$* 15
don’t make it so that warren buffet-- %$* 15
don’t make it so that warren buffet never pays taxes. %$* 15
but i think recognizing-- %$* 436
unrealized capital gains is taxed at a zero rate. %$* 15
i mean, that’s why these things-- %$* 15
make it so it’s a flat tax on all income period. %$* 15
then you get the growth or you will get the revenue gains, nouriel. %$* 15
frankly, you really will get them. %$* 15
well, what is your definition of where the spending stops? %$* 13
where does a person-- %$* 13
well then you go to the spending side and i would put it on a balanced budget and vote for if you’re going to have more spending, you’ve got to vote to debit tax rates, go step in step. %$* 15
you can’t do it separately. %$* 15
and if people want more taxes and more government, once you get an efficient system, god bless them, it’s their country. %$* 15
but my view is i’d rather see it go the other way. %$* 15
i think the other way would be better but it’s their country and they deserve it. %$* 15
i mean, people deserve the governments they get and that’s for sure. %$* 15
but it isn’t just let it go at all times and nouriel, i thought, in the debate at least when you were introduced, was that you won the debate last time you were here, nouriel, by saying it was washington’s fault, not wall street’s fault. %$* 15
nouriel, response? %$* 13
first of all it wasn’t wall street’s fault as much as government. %$* 163
the point is that we have a huge budget deficit that everybody knows is unsustainable. %$* 163
it’s trillion dollars. %$* 163
but the question is how did we get here, and by the time obama came to power, the deficit was already a trillion dollars. %$* 163
first of all, it happened because we had totally unsustainable tax cuts in 2001, 2003.two, we had these laissez-faire policies that led to the worst economic and financial crisis and we had to bail out the banks. %$* 163
the collapse of income led to the collapse of revenues. %$* 163
and that’s the situation we started from. %$* 163
now we have a budget deficit that’s 10 percent of gdp. do we really think that we are going to be able to reduce spending by 10 percent of gdp? %$* 163
everybody agrees we need entitlement spending reform. %$* 163
we have to restructure social security, medicare. %$* 163
we have to cut entitlement spending. %$* 163
but how are you going to fix this gap? %$* 163
how are you going to go to a zero budget balance? %$* 163
when bush left the administration, the tax rate in the united states as a share of gdp, revenues of the federal government were 15 percent, the lowest in the last 60 years. %$* 163
the average has been 20 percent because of his reckless tax cuts. %$* 163
so we need to reduce the budget deficit. %$* 163
we have to cut spending, but we also have to raise gradually over time revenues. %$* 163
there’s not going to be any way in which the american people are going to decide to slash social security, to slash medicare, to slash military spending and not to have any revenue increase. %$* 163
so we have to find way in the middle, but you guys are always on the side of lower taxes that every time they’re implemented during the reagan years, was in the bush years, led to bigger budget deficits and lead to economic and financial disasters. %$* 163
phil gramm. %$* 13
well, first of all, i don’t defend spending under george bush. %$* 435
neither do i. %$* 15
i thought we had an unnecessary deficit. %$* 435
i thought we let spending get out of control, especially after the house became democrat and you had pelosi as speaker. %$* 435
no, it’s just a plain fact. %$* 435
in seeking consensus, george w.bush spent money. %$* 435
we should have forced the defense build up as we fought wars to be offset against weapons procurement. %$* 435
but the plain truth is obama has proposed to expand or to extend the bush tax cut except for $30 billion. %$* 435
nobody is proposing to take that tax cut back. %$* 435
and look, let me tell you, having looked a long time at social security and medicare, you can't deal with these problems by raising taxes. %$* 435
you have got to be willing to change these systems and make them more actuarially balanced. %$* 435
when people started getting social security, the average american didn't live to be 65.the world is changed. %$* 435
the system didn't chan67ge. %$* 435
there was never a trust fund. %$* 435
it's a financial ponzi scheme of the worst sort. %$* 435
it was-- %$* 436
we've got to go back and fix these things. %$* 435
and doing polls, americans will always say they don't want to fight a battle intellectually as long as it's a choice. %$* 435
but when you give them effective leadership, they're willing to fight those battles. %$* 435
laura tyson. %$* 13
and what both parties need to do is give people a way of solving the problem instead of just simply saying, well, the people don't want to solve the problem. %$* 435
okay, let's bring in laura tyson to respond briefly because we have to take a break. %$* 13
my response would be that i do agree that we need to give the american people a choice. %$* 436
but i do want to say the american people, through poll after poll, are not willing to do basic arithmetic. %$* 436
this is not a size of government problem. %$* 436
it's an arithmetic problem. %$* 436
if we never had the great financial crisis of 2008 and ’9, we didn't have it at all, we would still face unsustainable deficits and debt driven by our programs that are the most popular programs with americans. %$* 436
we haven't talked about healthcare reform tonight. %$* 436
i try sometimes to link what we're talking about to the experience of other countries. %$* 436
i mentioned that we have a relatively small government by other countries' standards, that are very, very competitive growing economies with satisfied people who have suffered less from the great recession. %$* 436
most of these countries have very different healthcare systems than we do. %$* 436
and let's be clear about this. %$* 436
medicare itself as an entitlement problem is because of healthcare cost growth. %$* 436
but it's not because medicare grows faster than private healthcare. %$* 436
it's because we have a private healthcare cost problem in this country. %$* 436
we spend three times as much as any other country on a per capita basis on health. %$* 436
our healthcare costs grow most rapidly. %$* 436
and we do not have better quality. %$* 436
we do not have better outcomes. %$* 436
we do not have more choice. %$* 436
americans don't want to hear this, but they need to hear it because you cannot solve the deficit and debt problem, which would exist independent of the crisis, as i said, if we don't-- %$* 436
if we're not serious about healthcare reform. %$* 436
and you know how this was discussed by the critics of big government in the debate about healthcare reform? %$* 436
controlling costs was described as death panels, death panels. %$* 436
that's how you take a serious issue and you make it an ideological debate, which precludes making tough choices. %$* 436
all right. %$* 13
thank you, laura tyson. %$* 13
we're going to take a brief break. %$* 13
and when we come back, we're going to talk the audience's temperature on what they are hearing. %$* 13
so i mentioned before the debate that we want to try something tonight where we want to very briefly ask a few of you to raise your hands and in two or three sentences, answer a question that i am going to put to you about what you are hearing tonight. %$* 13
and then after that, we're going to come to you for questions. %$* 13
do you understand? %$* 13
so i'm going to ask you actually to tell us what you're hearing. %$* 13
and the question i'm going to put to you, when we come back, is what are you hearing from either side that you're just not buying, that you-- %$* 13
it's just not making sense. %$* 13
so do you want to-- %$* 13
anybody want to take a crack at that? %$* 13
if you just raise your hand, we'll bring a mic to you. %$* 13
okay, this gentleman in the green shirt here and a woman up-- %$* 13
woman necklace and-- %$* 13
if you can come down the steps. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
you can stand up. %$* 13
and on the right side, okay, the gentleman in the black shirt. %$* 13
i think it's black. %$* 13
yes, stand up. %$* 13
so i'd like you to just tell us, when we come back to this, just very briefly two to three sentences what you're hearing, why it doesn't work for you. %$* 13
all right? %$* 13
does everybody have a microphone? %$* 13
and i'd like-- %$* 13
no, gentleman in the green shirt has a microphone. %$* 13
can the three of you stand up? %$* 13
and i'm going to go this-- %$* 13
in that order, okay? %$* 13
so we come back. %$* 13
our motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit.” and now at this point in the debate we'd like to hear from you in the audience, just take your temperature on what you're hearing. %$* 13
and the question i want to put to you, as you listen to this debate, and you listen to these panelists debate, what are you hearing that you are just not buying? %$* 13
let's start with you, please. %$* 13
it's not so much a question of what are you-- %$* 19
i think your-- %$* 13
can you start again? %$* 13
your mic is on now. %$* 13
hello? %$* 19
okay. %$* 19
what i'm not hearing is the issue of jobs creation. %$* 19
is it possible that lower taxes, although they would probably increase the deficit, might also stimulate jobs creation which will result in more tax paying. %$* 19
and also what hasn't been mentioned is more consumption and greater confidence on the part of the consumer to spend money and stimulate the economy. %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
that was a perfect-- %$* 13
perfectly timed. %$* 13
sir, you saw the model. %$* 13
what i'm not hearing is that there's evidence that the laffer curve is maximized at 70 percent income tax. %$* 18
i'd like to hear more about that. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
and sir? %$* 13
and in my case, what i'm not hearing is what's going to happen for the next generation. %$* 18
for us, we're graduating from school, in my case at least. %$* 18
i don't want to go back to kennedy, reagan, what they did, what they did. %$* 18
i want to know what we're going to do now to solve the crisis that we are-- %$* 18
we have at hand. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so what we're hearing is a little bit of concern about the future. %$* 13
and phil gramm, you actually discussed this being a very bad time to be young. %$* 13
can you take on that topic? %$* 13
i don't know. %$* 435
any time is a good time to be young. %$* 435
true, true, true. %$* 13
well done. %$* 13
i think the link between marginal tax rates and the exertion of human energy is one of the best documented links of any economic observation in history. %$* 435
secondly, we do need to create more jobs. %$* 435
and that's what this debate is really about, even though, quite frankly, i didn't realize till you said it, that we hadn't been talking about it. %$* 435
and what does your future depend on? %$* 435
does it depend on government getting bigger? %$* 435
does it depend on half of all income taxes going just to service the debt on government? %$* 435
or does it depend on more opportunity and more freedom, where ordinary people are empowered to do extraordinary things? %$* 435
america is not a great and powerful country because the most brilliant people in the world came to live here. %$* 435
it's a great and powerful country because ordinary people like us have been able to do extraordinary things with our freedom. %$* 435
and that's what i believe is in peril. %$* 435
that's why these numbers scare me. %$* 435
all right. %$* 13
let's go to questions now. %$* 13
and these are questions. %$* 13
and again, questions are terse, and they are questions. %$* 13
and please don't read statements. %$* 13
please don't do two-part questions. %$* 13
one part. %$* 13
choose your part, and try to keep it on our topic. %$* 13
and this gentleman, red suspenders. %$* 13
sir, if you can stand up, the camera will find you. %$* 13
you're on the left side. %$* 13
and if you can just take a second, i want to make sure the camera has you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
go ahead and ask your question. %$* 13
i was hoping to hear something about the stiflage of the american spirit. %$* 18
i heard a lot about-- %$* 18
sir, can you hold the mic closer to you and repeat the question because they can't hear you. %$* 13
i was hoping to hear more about the stiflage of the american spirit. %$* 18
i'm not sure that i heard exactly what the american spirit is. %$* 18
how many people-- %$* 18
what percentage of the population has this american spirit now and what-- %$* 18
in what way is this stiflage going to have any effect on the rest of us who go about our quotidian daily lives. %$* 18
laura tyson. %$* 13
yes. %$* 436
let me say a little bit about that because i think we can also relate it to jobs. %$* 436
i mean, i think-- %$* 436
when i think about the american spirit, and i think about the current situation, i do worry most about young people. %$* 436
we haven't-- %$* 436
we've talked about the government tonight. %$* 436
we haven't talked about state government. %$* 436
state governments do have balanced budgets. %$* 436
one of the reasons that you don't feel so much of the federal stimulus effect is because states have had to contract a lot. %$* 436
and do you know where they contract? %$* 436
they contract in education. %$* 436
that's where they have to contract. %$* 436
so if you think of the american spirit as art programs, if you think of it as music programs, if you think of it as athletic programs, if you think of it as foreign language programs, if you think of it as your child going to school in a safe building structure that's energy efficient, all of those things are being stifled, because the state revenues have collapsed because we are in a major recession. %$* 436
and the major recession was caused by a major financial shock. %$* 436
and frankly, again, there is no easy way out of this. %$* 436
and i for one think because the federal government can afford to borrow at very attractive very low interest rates near record low interest rates, we should be helping those who are unemployed get training, we should be helping teachers stay in school, we should be providing aid so that every single kid who wants to go to college right now can afford to go to college. %$* 436
what better time to go to college than right now? %$* 436
so those are the ways in which i think the debt we inherited, the concern about deficits, the unwillingness to let the government help as it does-- %$* 436
as it's helped throughout history in this kind of crisis, to help ordinary americans achieve their spirit, that this is a real problem. %$* 436
do you think, laura, that-- %$* 13
do you think this-- %$* 13
the american spirit is presently stifled? %$* 13
i think the american spirit has been-- %$* 436
the confidence in the u.s.has been shaken by the depth of the crisis we are in, and i think the way we are forcing cuts on basic services like education is certainly stifling the spirit and perhaps the life prospects of kids who are five, six, seven years old. %$* 436
remember, we have 25 percent now-- %$* 436
almost 25 percent of children in poverty in the united states. %$* 436
you've had a run, laura, so let me bring in phil gramm, please. %$* 13
phil. %$* 13
well, let me first say i agree with you, you asked about how many people had it, the answer is "not enough." to me the american spirit is a belief that based on your own merit, based on your own hard work, no matter who your daddy was or who he wasn't, or who your mama was, that people are going to judge you on your ability, and that you have it within your power to succeed. %$* 435
now, obviously it's better to be-- %$* 435
it's better to be clever, and pretty, and rich. %$* 435
but being plain, and ordinary, and poor, those things are not insurmountable obstacles in america. %$* 435
and it's that belief of what we can do, but you can't have unlimited government and unlimited opportunity. %$* 435
you have to make a choice. %$* 435
art and i aren't against government, but we believe that it has got to be limited if we're going to have that kind of opportunity. %$* 435
and americans are optimistic people because of who we are and what our history has been. %$* 435
we can't have france's government and be americans. %$* 435
great. %$* 436
could you rise, sir? %$* 13
and i just-- %$* 13
okay, they've got you. %$* 13
to mr. %$* 18
roubini, i think we're all agreed that one thing that is stifling to the american spirit is the financial crisis, as you noted in your remarks. %$* 18
now, so whatever caused the financial crisis is presumably stifling to the american spirit, and has been noted, when you were last here, you successfully argued that government is the primary cause of the financial crisis, not the private sector, ergo, it is government that is stifling to the american spirit. %$* 18
so i ask you-- %$* 18
why aren't you sitting over there? %$* 18
now, i realize you've just been the target of a personal attack. %$* 13
you know, when i was last here i argued that both the government and the private sector was to be blamed for the crisis and it was a crisis caused by many policy mistakes by those who-- %$* 163
by reckless risk taking, leverage, and debt of the private sector-- %$* 163
so it's always a complicated story. %$* 163
but if the american spirit is stifled today, it is because this is not a mental recession, this is a real recession, this is the worst recession we have had since the great depression with unemployment rate now at 17 percent. %$* 163
we have nine million people out of work that have lost their jobs, and unless we address this problem, we're not going to resolve this mental, and physical, and economic, and financial depression. %$* 163
now, what can we do about jobs? %$* 163
the cbo, congressional budget office, did a study that suggested that of all the types of stimulus, the one that has the least effect on economic growth and job creation is reducing taxes for the rich. %$* 163
and the one that has the strongest effect on raising the demand for labor is to reduce the payroll tax both for employers and employees. %$* 163
and i proposed in an article recently a reduction temporarily in the payroll tax for employers and employees to be paid by the expiration of the tax cuts for the rich. %$* 163
they are expiring at the end of the year, so it’s not a budget busting reduction in taxes, it’s revenue neutral. %$* 163
we’re not going to increase the budget deficit that’s already one trillion and a half and stimulate economic growth. %$* 163
we have to stop subsidizing the rich. %$* 163
we have to start stimulating demand for labor for workers. %$* 163
that’s what we need to do. %$* 163
art laffer. %$* 13
let me just carry nouriel’s comments a little further and i do agree with him on that. %$* 15
is when you look at a firm’s decision to hire a worker, that firm that makes its decision based upon the gross wages paid to the worker. %$* 15
the marginal product they have to get out of that worker has to cover the gross wages paid, inclusive of all costs. %$* 15
when you look at a worker’s decision to work, they look at net wages received. %$* 15
they couldn’t care less how much the firm pays. %$* 15
they care how much they get net. %$* 15
and there’s a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received, one on the demand curve and one on the supply curve of labor. %$* 15
what you’ve got to do is reduce that wedge to make it more attractive for firms to hire workers and more attractive for workers to work. %$* 15
one way of doing that is nouriel’s comment here to lower the payroll taxes. %$* 15
that would work very well. %$* 15
where i do disagree with him totally is on raising tax rates on the rich who are the people who do the employment. %$* 15
let me tell you, these guys don’t employ workers for altruistic reasons. %$* 15
they employ the workers to get an after-tax profit of their own. %$* 15
and if you make it discouraging for them to employ workers, they’re not going to employ them. %$* 15
these people are the decision makers and that’s what you’ve really got to worry about. %$* 15
it’s not an equity argument of whether the rich can afford it or not. %$* 15
it’s whether they’ll disemploy people or not. %$* 15
just look at their behavior. %$* 15
that’s what you’ve got to do. %$* 15
but he’s right. %$* 15
it’s the wedge between the wages paid and wages received and that is the key to bringing employment back. %$* 15
everything we’re not doing today. %$* 15
can i ask art a question that actually combines something? %$* 436
so nouriel is suggesting, and it’s something i also support, thinking about bringing the top two bush tax cuts for the top two percent down back to the clinton era and using the money which is 30 to 40 billion dollars next year either for a payroll tax deduction or for more aid to the states or for a number of other things. %$* 436
now you suggested that, art, that you were concerned about raising taxes on the rich. %$* 436
this would basically be bringing them back to the clinton level, which you thought was fine. %$* 436
it actually worked really well. %$* 436
no. %$* 15
i thought the program was fine. %$* 15
so we need the revenue-- %$* 436
no but that was a key part of his program. %$* 436
give me-- %$* 436
that was the first-- %$* 436
as nouriel has already said, that was the first thing that he did. %$* 436
the reason that the democrats lost control of the congress in 1994 is because the republicans claimed that the democrats were responsible for the largest middle class tax increase in history. %$* 436
do you know what that was? %$* 436
a four and a half cent gasoline tax, okay? %$* 436
so i say you think those taxes of the clinton administration were fine, let’s go back to them, take the money which is 40 billion dollars next year and my goodness we could find several ways, the cbo listed about 10 different ways of using that money to create more jobs. %$* 436
alright, i have to do a quick piece of radio for radio right now. %$* 13
our motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit.” this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this debate. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, “big government is stifling the american spirit.” and i want to take to this side a specific recommendation that nouriel makes in his new book about wall street compensation. %$* 13
he talks about the need to cure compensation and he’s not talking about the amounts. %$* 13
he’s talking about the way in which it is structured, which he said helped encourage practices that led to the financial crisis. %$* 13
moreover, he says government needs to be involved in this process of curing compensation on wall street. %$* 13
your response to that concept. %$* 13
well look, i want to say one thing about rich people. %$* 435
how many people poorer than you-- %$* 435
so phil, can you answer my question? %$* 13
have ever hired you? %$* 435
mr. %$* 13
gramm, can you answer my question? %$* 13
i’ll be glad to. %$* 435
thank you. %$* 13
the last thing in the world we need is the government setting peoples’ compensation in the private sector. %$* 435
i work for a big investment bank. %$* 435
some people we pay a lot of money to. %$* 435
do we want to pay it? %$* 435
no. %$* 435
the problem is they’ll go to work for somebody else. %$* 435
that's what's called competition. %$* 435
and when we start setting our value judgment as the standard by which we're going to gauge value, we start making a mistake. %$* 435
now, i don't have any problem with deferred comp that tie people's objectives to long-term earning. %$* 435
but the idea that government ought to be involved in setting compensation is as alien to the american spirit as any idea can be. %$* 435
nouriel roubini. %$* 13
the problem was that we-- %$* 163
the problem was we privatized the gains, the bonuses, the profits in good times. %$* 163
and then those guys led to a reckless financial crisis. %$* 163
and now we socialize the losses, and everybody here has to pay for those compensations. %$* 163
that's why the government has to interfere, i’m sorry to say, because a $2 trillion bailout of wall street, who is paying for it? %$* 163
we are paying for it. %$* 163
the government doing that. %$* 15
and you don't want any control on compensation either. %$* 163
art laffer, repeat. %$* 13
repeat. %$* 13
that is the problem with government. %$* 15
nouriel just said it right. %$* 15
nouriel, let me just so-- %$* 15
you said it right. %$* 15
the government shouldn't bail these guys out. %$* 15
they shouldn't bail out the housing industry. %$* 15
they shouldn't bail out any of these guys. %$* 15
the only bail outs you should do are for individuals-- %$* 15
we privatized the gains. %$* 163
we socialized the losses. %$* 163
who are unemployed or can't help themselves for a time period. %$* 15
but it shouldn't be 99 weeks. %$* 15
that doesn't make any sense. %$* 15
it just makes it so it's not worth the working. %$* 15
and by the way, laura, one factual thing. %$* 15
i did support bill clinton, and i thought he was a great president from that standpoint. %$* 15
i did not agree with that tax increase. %$* 15
please don't put that on me. %$* 15
i thought he did lots of other things that way overwhelmed that. %$* 15
okay. %$* 436
but that was one thing i did not support. %$* 15
okay. %$* 436
sir, you have a neck tie, and if you stand up, a mic will come to you. %$* 13
that's everybody, i know. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
go ahead, please. %$* 13
pardon me if i get my facts wrong, senator gramm. %$* 18
but it is my understanding that the bank that you served as chairman, ubs, received a bailout from the government of switzerland. %$* 18
do you feel as though that is incongruous with the position you are taking in this debate? %$* 18
what-- %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
can you tell me what-- %$* 13
how you are relating that to our motion? %$* 13
well, it's the role of government in the private sector. %$* 18
yeah, the bailout. %$* 436
it may not be the american government. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
fair enough. %$* 13
i just wanted to get that clarified. %$* 13
well, let me say-- %$* 435
i guess you can tell by my accent i'm not from zurich. %$* 435
i been in swiss politics, i would not have been for the bailout. %$* 435
it is clear to me we would have survived and prospered without it. %$* 435
i do believe, however, that it is important to note that it was government, through cra, pressuring banks to make subprime loans. %$* 435
it was federal quotas on freddie and fannie where they had to hold more and more subprime paper. %$* 435
as our dear colleague argued when he was last here, this was a crisis made in washington. %$* 435
i also think it's important to note-- %$* 435
and i'm not here to defend a bank bailout. %$* 435
but i think it's pretty clear freddie and fannie have not paid their money back and probably never will. %$* 435
almost all the banks have paid it back with a profit. %$* 435
laura tyson. %$* 13
who owns fannie and freddie? %$* 15
i'd like to say two things about this financial crisis, one is just to recommend a book, because i have used history a lot tonight, and i haven't cited the book. %$* 436
the book is called this time it's different. %$* 436
it's a great book. %$* 436
everyone should read it. %$* 436
it's based on an analysis of financial crises over a time and across countries. %$* 436
you don't have to mention-- %$* 436
there's no fannie mae or freddie mac in that book. %$* 436
there's no particular piece of legislation. %$* 436
there are some basic things that are true in financial crises. %$* 436
they have to do with overleverage. %$* 436

certain states have passed laws that demand that the chemicals be revealed. %$* 539
so, what's basically been happening over the last four or five years, you have cases like in new york state-- %$* 539
which stopped fracking until they could study it. %$* 539
and now they're getting ready to open it up in a small way, in a safe way. %$* 539
it can be done. %$* 539
all right. %$* 13
deborah goldberg, you’re opponents say we do know a lot about science. %$* 13
well, let me be very clear either right from the start that neither of us have argued that it should stop right now. %$* 537
what we have argued is that the boom is the problem, that it's going much too fast, and it's outstripping both the science and the protections. %$* 537
so, we think that what-- %$* 537
for example, what new york has done, makes a great deal of sense, is stop for a while, when it's not necessary, we have a glut coming from other places-- %$* 537
and take a look at what the impacts are-- %$* 537
and figure out what needs to be done. %$* 537
but to joe nocera's point, where he says, actually, we-- %$* 13
refuting you and saying that we actually do know a good amount now, can you take that on? %$* 13
well, we learned, we have learned more recently. %$* 537
but the fact of the matter is, there's a great deal that we don't know. %$* 537
and the reason that we don't know that is that the industry has done everything in its power to keep us from getting the data that we need in order to really do the study. %$* 537
so, for example, i just submitted a freedom of information request to new york state department of environmental conservation, asking them for the results of water quality studies that they had done in connection with oil and gas development in the state. %$* 537
and what they told me was, “we don't have any. %$* 537
we don't ask for that.” so, how are you going to do serious science if you don't have a baseline test of the conditions? %$* 537
and additional studies during operation? %$* 537
and follow-up afterwards? %$* 537
you know, we are learning something because of public pressure, but there's a long way to go. %$* 537
all right, susan. %$* 13
john, yeah. %$* 540
i'd like to weigh in on this one. %$* 540
one of the things that the debate about what we know about the science focuses on is the question of how much methane emissions are leaking from the entire life cycle, from the production well all the way to the consumers' burner tip. %$* 540
and we actually-- %$* 540
there's a great deal that we know about that. %$* 540
we don't know everything. %$* 540
we should know a whole lot more. %$* 540
deborah pointed out-- %$* 540
so, what-- %$* 13
what does that mean, then? %$* 13
is deborah right? %$* 13
we lack-- %$* 540
we should know a whole lot more, is that we should slow things down until we know a whole lot more? %$* 13
no. %$* 540
we should not slow things down, but we should absolutely insist on better measurements. %$* 540
we should measure what is a baseline for conditions prior to drilling-- %$* 540
so, why not slow things down more? %$* 13
if you're conceding that more work actually needs to be done, why not pause? %$* 13
what's the harm in pausing? %$* 13
there are a number of different harms. %$* 540
one of them is the multi-billion dollar contribution that lower natural gas prices have provided for the united states economy. %$* 540
another reason is the development of chemical jobs and industries that are coming back to the united states because natural gas is a feedstock that's supportable. %$* 540
the greenhouse gas emissions that have been reduced in the last three years because of-- %$* 540
when you take aside and account for the effects of the economy having crashed, there are much lower greenhouse gas emissions. %$* 540
all right. %$* 13
so, kate hudson, your opponent's saying that the benefits train has left the station. %$* 13
the good stuff is happening and to slow down the program would cause those-- %$* 13
those list of harms she just went through. %$* 13
i think that the benefits that have just been recited are questionable. %$* 538
for instance, luring the petrochemical industry back into this country, is that really what we want? %$* 538
or shouldn't we instead be trying to move towards a green economic future for our children, rather than having-- %$* 538
a fossil-fuel based industry come back? %$* 538
well, it's a big country. %$* 539
we need lots of different kinds of jobs. %$* 539
of course we need green jobs. %$* 539
we need other kinds of jobs, too. %$* 539
are you in mid-sentence or-- %$* 13
i'm speechless. %$* 539
because of the-- %$* 13
so, go ahead, kate. %$* 13
no, i want to actually go to the subject of jobs, because one of the characteristics of the extraction industry is the boom and bust. %$* 538
and what is happening already is that there is-- %$* 538
when the rigs come into town, there are lots of jobs that come up. %$* 538
truck drivers, they need a lot of truck drivers. %$* 538
they frack the wells and they leave. %$* 538
and then the economy busts. %$* 538
and the record is that those economies are in worse shape than before the extraction industry came into town. %$* 538
sue tierney. %$* 13
what our opponents are saying is that when we look at a microscope about the impacts on localities, there are-- %$* 540
there are-- %$* 540
there are tremendous challenges that's going on in those communities. %$* 540
i don't think joe or i would say that that's not the case. %$* 540
but every person in this audience drives a car, whether it's a prius or something else, and there is extraction going on for getting that oil somewhere. %$* 540
coal mining is all over the country and colorado is an example of a state where they've said the environmental benefit of a natural gas fired fleet of power plants outweigh the risks and the harm. %$* 540
so there are tradeoffs and compensations across these areas. %$* 540
the wind farms, you want to talk about disrupting areas-- %$* 540
by the way, i'm a huge fan of wind farms. %$* 540
i'm in favor of wind. %$* 540
i'm probably one of the few people who is very eager to say that, but as a result of that there are lots of community impacts in a variety of different places that people are talking about. %$* 540
i have a question for the side that's arguing against fracking. %$* 539
i'm just interested in clarity on the positions you have staked out and it doesn't-- %$* 539
you don't necessarily have to be agreeing with each other, but i feel as though you're not necessarily, because kate hudson is saying having the petro chemical industry retake root here, particularly in new parts of the country, is not a very attractive idea. %$* 539
at the same time, deborah, you're saying well, we're not against fracking, we just want fracking to be good, to work beneficially and without harm. %$* 539
so, is this team against fracking, against the petro chemical industry, you know, working here? %$* 539
or is it not? %$* 539
i think that we are not saying stop everything all at once and i don't think kate is saying that either. %$* 537
we know that we need some natural gas, probably to keep the lights on for a while. %$* 537
the really big problem is that the focus on this industry and the power and wealth of this industry is actually derailing the attempts that we have been making in the past to put a price on carbon, for example, to move ourselves to an energy-- %$* 537
an economy that would actually be sustainable in the future. %$* 537
so, neither of us are saying that there aren't advantages in some situations between putting in a gas plant, say, instead of a coal plant, if we really knew what the lifecycle methane emissions were. %$* 537
and both of our opponents have admitted that we don't. %$* 537
and we actually-- %$* 537
but john, let me talk about the methane emissions and what we know about the science there. %$* 540
there has been one study by cornell university that looks at the methane emissions and has concluded that the methane emissions that are associated with the entire lifecycle of natural gas make it worse than coal. %$* 540
the study has been tremendously critiqued by peers for a number of ways in which that study does not rely on what people know to be the case about emissions. %$* 540
for example, the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggests that you use a hundred-year warming potential, an element that you would use to calculate how much global warming potential there is from a fuel. %$* 540
the cornell folks have used something very, very different than that, which greatly increases the harm that methane would show relative to coal emissions. %$* 540
there are two or three other technical reasons where the peer critiques have said these all exaggerate the emissions. %$* 540
most of the reasonable science has said and there's a tremendous body of evidence on this, that coal-- %$* 540
when you combust coal at a power plant it will have twice as much emissions of greenhouse gas, including methane, than coal. %$* 540
may i respond to that? %$* 537
yes, please. %$* 13
so there's not one study, but there is a variety of studies, and they rely on estimates of emissions that have information that comes principally from the industry. %$* 537
i know of only one study that actually went out into the field and measured the emissions from the gas well, and that study showed that our methane emissions are about four percent of production. %$* 537
now, i agree that we could reduce those if we had better regulations in place, but the industry is out there fighting those regulations. %$* 537
we just had a new epa rule that was designed to address the emissions from the fracking system, and there was a new rule put in place that would decidedly make it better in terms of methane emissions because they would put the gas pipelines in before they actually let the gas go, and the industry successfully delayed the implementation of this green completion system for another three years. %$* 537
but john, i really-- %$* 540
let me bring joe nocera in, and joe, let me put the question to you, because you're a journalist. %$* 13
you're paid to be cynical about things. %$* 13
are corporations-- %$* 13
you made the point that you think the environmentalists are actually the ones who have squeezed information out of the corporations. %$* 13
is that because that is the dynamic. %$* 13
in other words-- %$* 13
no. %$* 539
i think-- %$* 539
the corporations are-- %$* 13
in other words, your-- %$* 13
no, i think-- %$* 539
but the corporations are dodging and weaving? %$* 13
i think the dynamic is actually pretty different. %$* 539
i think the dynamic is that industry began as-- %$* 539
fracking was not started by exxon or shell. %$* 539
fracking was basically a bunch of small companies who really developed the technology as innovators often do and then the big boys came in. %$* 539
the environmentalists correctly said, "this needs to be cleaned up, and it needs to be regulated, and it needs to be looked at more closely." and what has happened is that the objections and the rising concern has basically caused industry, especially the big guys, to say, "you know what? %$* 539
we really would like to be on the right side of this, and we are going to try and get there."and there have actually been-- %$* 539
you know, shell, one of the big oil companies, they recycle most of the water that they inject in the well. %$* 539
there are lots of things like that going on. %$* 539
now, part of the problem is that you can't rely on industry best practices. %$* 539
you have to regulate it. %$* 539
and part of the problem is that the regulation is mostly done by the states, not by the federal government. %$* 539
and so you're sort of dependent on appropriate state regulation. %$* 539
pennsylvania, when they began, didn't regulate it very well. %$* 539
they've learned a lot. %$* 539
they are regulating it better. %$* 539
it is getting better in pennsylvania. %$* 539
kate hudson, joe nocera paints the portrait of the situation getting better in terms of both government regulation stepping up and companies fessing up, what about that? %$* 13
well, i would like to point out that one of the reasons why we're stuck with state regulation is because the oil and gas companies lobbied their way out of at least a half dozen federal environmental laws and requirements, and so now it's with the states. %$* 538
and i'm not particularly impressed by the example of pennsylvania, which the communities in that state and the environment in that state suffered greatly while the state played regulatory catch-up. %$* 538
and it is still the case that the industry is given a tremendous break. %$* 538
in addition to that, at the state level, across the country, there are not enough regulators to police that. %$* 538
so even if you had half decent regulations, you don't have the staff to put in the field to make sure that those regulations are being complied with. %$* 538
just-- %$* 13
i assume that where this side draws the line though, because you've said now a couple of times you're not against fracking, you're against the pace-- %$* 13
the enthusiasm-- %$* 13
so do you see a future where fracking happens and the marcellus shale, the area that is now, at least in the east coast, the most controversial large area covering pennsylvania and new york state, do you see a future where the regulation that you're asking for is so effective and the science has been so checked out that if we do go ahead and have 80 years of fracking in that area and that's okay with you? %$* 13
eighty years of fracking is not okay. %$* 537
we need to get off of fossil fuels a lot faster than that. %$* 537
okay, so-- %$* 539
okay, joe nocera. %$* 13
okay, so-- %$* 539
so you want a situation where all jobs are green jobs, and you don't have a petro- chemical industry because they're bad guys, and you have a situation where you want to-- %$* 539
let's assume you could shut down fracking tomorrow, let's assume that, and your vision is that the consequence of that would be that this would cause a rush to renewables, but that's not what would happen. %$* 539
it would cause a rush to coal. %$* 539
the market is buying energy based on its price, and one of the reasons renewables have had so much trouble is because they have a hard time competing with coal. %$* 539
coal is the hardest thing to compete with because it's cheap. %$* 539
so you think that-- %$* 539
what you're trying to avoid, i understand, is another 100-year cycle of fossil fuel, and that's admirable, but it's also unrealistic, and what you have with natural gas is a fuel that is cleaner than coal and maybe could help you get to renewables. %$* 539
and i-- %$* 539
but if it is such a great boon, are they right that basically the-- %$* 13
we're in a world right now where the price of energy up until very recently has been seen as so egregious that there has been much more effort put towards looking at renewables, and if we suddenly enter into the 1950s again-- %$* 13
won't go that far, but if we suddenly get to a place where the price drops tremendously, we’re going to stop the push to find alternatives. %$* 13
no, we're not. %$* 540
the states-- %$* 540
37 states in the united states have adopted portfolio standards which require renewable energy to be entering the market really almost at any cost, and they are pushing that envelope forward. %$* 540
that is helping to reduce the costs of renewable energy. %$* 540
that is a fantastic thing-- %$* 540
yeah, but, sue, their argument is if we have this sustained period of really relatively less expensive energy, that, that push will fade, and come back again in 80 years when it's too late. %$* 13
well, i agree with joe that if there is a moratorium on natural gas development, unconventional gas around the united states, we're going back to coal. %$* 540
yeah, but that's not the answer to the question. %$* 13
it is the answer to the question whether you like it or not. %$* 540
it is the answer to the question. %$* 540
that is what will happen in the united states. %$* 540
right, but will there be a drop-off in looking at alternative-- %$* 13
trying to develop alternative measures? %$* 13
no, there are policy triggers that are pulling renewable energy development into markets around the country. %$* 540
that is the case. %$* 540
okay, a question i want to put to this side. %$* 13
joe nocera’s opening remarks talked about a part of this. %$* 13
we haven't touched on it yet at all. %$* 13
national security, the ability to, you know, have our own private, in oilfield terms, "saudi arabia" right in our own pocket, right in our own country. %$* 13
we don't have to deal with these folks anymore. %$* 13
we can try to realize the fantasy of energy independence, and that this is something that we've been dreaming about for 40 years, that you don't just walk away from that. %$* 13
and your side basically-- %$* 13
you seem to shrug at that and not treat that as really, really great. %$* 13
so i'd like to know why you think that that's not necessarily germane. %$* 13
well, i would say first of all joe was very careful to talk about national-- %$* 537
or energy security and not energy independence, and i don't think that most economists and energy experts think that what we want is independence in the sense that we aren't going to do any trade on energy issues with any other country. %$* 537
what they are talking about is we want to be doing that trade with people who are our friends. %$* 537
and part of what has happened because we've been so focused on gas-- %$* 537
and again i really object to the idea that the alternative is, "stop it now or 100 years."that is not what we're-- %$* 537
that's a straw man-- %$* 537
that's not what we're arguing here. %$* 537
but what we have done is we have ceded a lot of the industry that is developing, for example, photovoltaic solar energy, to china. %$* 537
and so if we are not going to actually speed up our development of the renewable energies here, and instead we're going to be diverted into a 80 years of gas, then we are going to be at a point sometime when we don't have the resources-- %$* 537
the renewable resources, and we're going to be importing them sometime. %$* 537
that's not energy security. %$* 537
the reason-- %$* 539
so in other words you're saying it's-- %$* 13
you think it would be a very, very short lived bubble of benefit in terms of energy security? %$* 13
i don't actually see where the energy security is going to come ultimately if, in fact, the goal of the gas companies, which has been made clear by 15 applications that have been made to the federal government, to export the natural gas to the european and asian markets, where they can get four to five times as much money for the gas as they can in the domestic market. %$* 538
so once we start exporting that gas, how is that helping our national energy security right now? %$* 538
sue tierney. %$* 13
the geopolitics of natural gas and oil are pretty compelling when you look around at a lot of different areas of the world. %$* 540
parts of western europe have been held hostage by getting natural gas across pipelines crossing the ukraine from russia, and that has created tremendous problems so that the ability for them to be able to get natural gas from friendly areas is a very compelling story. %$* 540
same is true for china. %$* 540
china actually has a very large shale gas deposit. %$* 540
they are very interested in learning the knowhow in the united states associated with this technology. %$* 540
if china is able to use natural gas, they may not build as many soviet-style nuclear reactors. %$* 540
they may not have challenges with the middle east oil problem, which is-- %$* 540
that their own internal demand is driving. %$* 540
joe nocera. %$* 13
the thing that-- %$* 539
you mentioned china and you mentioned the solar industry moving to china, and i think it gets to the point that you don't really want to sort of deal with, which is cost. %$* 539
solar is moving to china because it's cheaper, and solar is cheaper-- %$* 539
and the problem renewables have and have had is that they're in this constant struggle to get the cost down to where it's cost-effective to use, and it's cheaper in china. %$* 539
that-- %$* 539
i was on the board of one of the now bankrupt solar energy companies, evergreen solar. %$* 540
it was more cost effective to build the next manufacturing facility and then ship the panels back to the united states to meet the solar market because of china's subsidies for the industry. %$* 540
so manufacturing is moving to china, but the united states' demand for solar is not going to mean we're not going to get solar back. %$* 540
we will get solar panels back. %$* 540
right, but the question was, energy security. %$* 537
and the concern was being at the mercy of a country that isn't really aligned with our interests. %$* 537
and i think that we would mostly agree that unless things change very much, china is not the one that has completely bought into our value system. %$* 537
and so, we are-- %$* 537
we're not going to get the energy security. %$* 537
we may get the cheaper panels, but we are going to be dependent on a hostile country. %$* 537
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to questions from the audience now. %$* 13
and the way it will work is that you raise your hand. %$* 13
a microphone will come to you. %$* 13
i need to tell the folks that are in-- %$* 13
that are not in the lit area that i can't see you. %$* 13
so, if you can't see your wristwatch-- %$* 13
read your watch-- %$* 13
i can't see you. %$* 13
so, if you want to ask a question, step forward and come to the edge of the light, and i'll try to take your question. %$* 13
and again, if you arrived late, i want this to be a question-- %$* 13
not a debate. %$* 13
these guys are the debaters. %$* 13
just ask a question that's on our point, and that's terse, and that really helps move things along that's on our topic. %$* 13
start, right there. %$* 13
the question i have is to reframe the debate a little bit. %$* 18
our concern is pollution of our groundwater and our environment with fracking fluids. %$* 18
joe, you had mentioned that everyone knows what's in it. %$* 18
i would take issue with that. %$* 18
many of the chemicals are trade secrets. %$* 18
how can we allow that? %$* 18
why can we not develop a safe-- %$* 18
to use the term loosely-- %$* 18
fracking fluid and use that more exclusively? %$* 18
sir, do you mind just telling us your name? %$* 13
phil rodman. %$* 18
thanks very much. %$* 13
so-- %$* 540
sue tierney. %$* 13
full disclosure would be a marvelous thing. %$* 540
i think joe and i would agree that that should be the case. %$* 540
there is a very narrow piece of the fracking fluid that is what we would call “intellectual property.”in other words, if you could put all the ingredients out there and allow fracking and transparency on that issue, that should be the case. %$* 540
and your second point was-- %$* 540
i don't remember. %$* 540
sorry. %$* 540
why can't we come up with a safer solution? %$* 18
oh, there are many, many green completion approaches. %$* 540
environmentally friendly fluids. %$* 540
so, they are on the marketplace, they can be used. %$* 540
why don't we use it? %$* 18
we should. %$* 540
let's go to the other side for a response, so that-- %$* 13
deborah, deborah goldberg. %$* 13
well, i mean, there are a lot of things that we could do and we should do. %$* 537
but they're not happening. %$* 537
and this huge resistance to that is happening. %$* 537
and so, you know, there's a great deal of talk about this disclosure system that was created by the groundwater protection council and the industry. %$* 537
and they're not disclosing everything. %$* 537
for the most part, they're disclosing only what is regulated as hazardous under our worker health safety issues. %$* 537
there are a couple of states that have now said that you must disclose everything to the agency. %$* 537
but they are not disclosing everything to the public. %$* 537
and transparency remains a huge issue. %$* 537
you know, the secretary of energy advisory board subcommittee on fracking-- %$* 537
on which sue tierney served-- %$* 537
talks about transparency in a much broader way, so that we get the data about our water quality, and get the data about our air quality. %$* 537
none of this is available to the public right now. %$* 537
and we are involved litigation-- %$* 537
this very minute-- %$* 537
to try and get the court record from a case involving public health unsealed so that public health professionals in pennsylvania can actually see the allegations and use them as part of a database to help prevent and treat health problems in pennsylvania. %$* 537
and we're fighting the industry-- %$* 537
okay. %$* 13
to try to get that transparency. %$* 537
do you want to respond or-- %$* 13
i just want to mention the secretary of energy advisory board was unanimous in saying that there should be better disclosure, much better transparency. %$* 540
there must-- %$* 540
much better regulation in all the ways that i just-- %$* 540
but every time you say that, it sounds to me like you're giving them the argument, because they're talking about the present-day situation. %$* 13
i-- %$* 540
and we need to move forward on that. %$* 540
stop demonizing natural gas as part of that. %$* 540
and the more that people are moving to the sides of the room-- %$* 540
no one is finding any middle ground on this. %$* 540
sir, and-- %$* 13
yes, sir? %$* 13
if you could, again, just state your name. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
as a model of a question, that was fantastic. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
do what he did. %$* 13
my name is dennis kreutz why is not the solution-- %$* 18
and i'm coming from this with some experience-- %$* 18
slow it down, get the science right, have the industry profit when gas prices are four or five or six dollars instead of two dollars? %$* 18
why is not that the solution to this whole debate? %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
i have one answer for that, which i think is very compelling to me. %$* 540
in the period from 2006 through 2011, when we had dozens and dozens of coal plants being proposed around-- %$* 540
new ones around the country that would lock in large new coal plants for another 50 or 60 years, the changing price of natural gas relative to coal killed those projects. %$* 540
there's a lot of credit given for environmental opposition to those plants and i will give them some credit, but at the end of the day it was natural gas projects that killed those. %$* 540
okay. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
also, if you have a sense that you're involved in this issue in a way that would be interesting to the rest of us, if you're working for an environmental organization or an energy company, share that with us when you introduce yourself. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name is erin griffin. %$* 19
my question has to do with water usage. %$* 19
as colorado and the southwest are projected to become drier as the climate warms, do you think that diverting millions of gallons of water into natural gas wells is an appropriate use of a resource that's already becoming more precious? %$* 19
so, john, let me try this. %$* 540
i'm on the natural climate assessment study right now on the impact of a changing climate on the energy sector. %$* 540
you're absolutely right that places will be drier. %$* 540
there will be more pressure on energy supplies. %$* 540
but i want to give you the water use for different fuels. %$* 540
biofuels, ethanol, 5,000 gallons of water per mmbq of energy. %$* 540
coal, 23 gallons of water per mmbq of energy. %$* 540
conventional gas is two and shale gas is two. %$* 540
and how much is wind? %$* 19
wind is wonderful, and we'll quintuple it. %$* 540
we'll do 10 times the amount and we still will have a little bit. %$* 540
is it true, though-- %$* 13
i'm just trying to go back to sixth grade science when, you know, it rains and then the water evaporates and goes up and becomes a cloud again, and then it rains and comes back to earth and it's a circle, but that in this process once the waste water has truly been used to the point where it can't be recycled, that it's stored under, you know, stored in wells well underground in perpetuity. %$* 13
so that water is taken out of the sixth grade circulation. %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
permanently. %$* 13
is that true? %$* 13
yes, that's true. %$* 540
is that worrisome? %$* 13
around the country for decades and decades, underground injection has been the water treatment process of choice. %$* 540
there are parts of the country where that cannot work because of the geology underground. %$* 540
pennsylvania's an example where there are very limited areas to be able to do that. %$* 540
so i want to know if the quantities of water that essentially are being taken out of circulation in a broad sense is significant. %$* 13
we understand that it can impact at a local level, but in a broad sense, are we talking about a significant amount of the earth's water? %$* 13
i’m putting that to the side arguing against fracking. %$* 13
i haven't really looked globally. %$* 537
the answer to that question is how much fracking do we do? %$* 537
it varies a great deal, you know, on a local basis, and that's where the water consumption takes place. %$* 537
so, for example, in the west we do have major problems with drought. %$* 537
we have forest fires right now. %$* 537
it's projected to get much worse. %$* 537
in the east we have a lot more water than we have in the west, and the water contamination issues are more serious from our perspective than the water quantity, but on the other hand, if you look locally at, you know, head water streams where we have native trout, you can back up your truck into one of those streams and you can drain it dry and that has happened in pennsylvania. %$* 537
so i can't say i really have the answer to your question, but-- %$* 537
the country-- %$* 539
joe nocera. %$* 13
the country has historically, in other forms of energy production, oil, for instance, set aside land and said thou shalt not drill here. %$* 539
and, you know, new york is doing the same thing with its watershed and it doesn't seem to me unreasonable to say yes, fracking is a good thing for the country, but it has some risks and therefore there are certain places we won't do it. %$* 539
that seems like a completely reasonable approach. %$* 539
i would agree. %$* 537
but to me that means that you're agreeing with us that we need to scale back. %$* 537
because we have-- %$* 537
that's actually saying you would do it surgically where you know you want to protect things, such as the unfiltered water supply of new york city, which is the way it's supported there. %$* 540
and it's great that we found this common ground, because that isn't what the industry is saying in new york. %$* 537
we are not the industry. %$* 540
i know that. %$* 537
thank goodness. %$* 537
there. %$* 13
in the center. %$* 13
microphone will come in-- %$* 13
yeah, thanks, very much. %$* 13
can i just-- %$* 538
yeah, sure, kate hudson, %$* 13
i just wanted to say that i think that the picking out special places that will be protected from fracking has some serious environmental justice issues around that. %$* 538
so the cities, the people who live in new york city, their drinking water will be protected, the other people in other parts of new york city, their drinking water will not be protected? %$* 538
i think that's-- %$* 538
actually-- %$* 540
i think that’s a policy question. %$* 538
most of new york-- %$* 540
sue tierney. %$* 13
city's water supply, as you know, comes from the aquifers upstate. %$* 540
so we're talking about all of new york city %$* 540
no, she's talking about all of new york state, right? %$* 537
the-- %$* 537
you know, we do want to see every community protected, not just ones that have a huge amount of political power in down state. %$* 537
and we don't want to be in a situation where the industry is going into the most economically depressed, most politically powerless areas, and that's where people are not only unable to make a living, but they're now being asked to shoulder disproportionate burdens on their health just to keep food on the table. %$* 537
could you stand up for us? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name's baron bixler and i am just wondering if you could comment on whether you think that the post-9/11 national-- %$* 18
i guess stance on security issues of national security vis-à-vis the middle east and more recently the great recession has provided the fracking industry with a convenient political backdrop of which to put forth its agenda-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
to develop. %$* 18
all right, i think that question is like a big softball to you guys. %$* 13
so you-- %$* 13
can swing at it? %$* 13
i'll say. %$* 539
take a swing? %$* 13
kate hudson? %$* 13
no, i think that the-- %$* 538
i'm not sure actually whether it's 9/11 itself. %$* 538
i think that the using of the national security energy independence argument to support moving forward with natural gas is playing off of the concerns that the nation has had around 9/11, but i think as we talked about, we think that that is not actually very realistic. %$* 538
and so-- %$* 538
the country has been trying to-- %$* 539
every president in my memory practically has talked about the importance of weaning ourselves from opec oil which-- %$* 539
and yet here we are finally in a position to actually do something about it because we have our own resource that-- %$* 539
a resource that we really didn't even know we had 20 years ago. %$* 539
and so 9/11 may have spurred the urgency to do this. %$* 539
i mean, my goodness, we have invaded countries, and we have-- %$* 539
our entire foreign policy towards the middle east is consciously or subconsciously about oil. %$* 539
and so the idea that we can change the way we think about other countries, the way we can deal with foreign policy, because we no longer have to sit around and worry about whether they're going to give us our oil or not seems to me like a wonderful thing. %$* 539
kate hudson. %$* 13
the vast majority of the oil that we use in this country is used for the transportation sector. %$* 538
natural gas is not going to replace that. %$* 538
natural gas can be used-- %$* 538
power sector, but not for the transportation sector. %$* 538
she's wrong. %$* 539
well, let me just pick up on kate's-- %$* 537
actually, just a moment for the other side to respond to because i want to hear what they have to say. %$* 13
sue tierney. %$* 13
every thoughtful well documented study that looks at how the united states will transform and decarbonize its economy includes shifting more of the transportation sector to electricity and natural gas, putting carbon capture and sequestration on natural gas facilities, but there is a role for fossil in that decarbonized world, and oil is about this much and it's in the aviation sector. %$* 540
you know-- %$* 539
well, let me-- %$* 13
there is-- %$* 539
well, let me let deborah come-- %$* 13
joe, let me let deborah come back because she-- %$* 13

it can be the difference between success and failure. %$* 549
and because of that, i urge you to vote no today on the motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." thank you. %$* 549
thank you, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." remember now how you voted in-- %$* 13
just before the debate began. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again after you hear all of the arguments. %$* 13
and again, to remind you, the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the live audience. %$* 13
the motion is, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." arguing for the motion, we've heard from anant agarwal and ben nelson. %$* 13
they have argued that critics of online education are looking at the flaws in how it is now and failing to see the potential that it has at the era that this is now only the dawn of. %$* 13
they say that it can improve dramatically and cash up in a field of academia where nothing has changed for eons, that there's an advantage in fact to being able to stop a professor and wind and rewind and even silence, if you want to, that there's a generation now, the millennial generation who are essentially wired to learn this way, that it will connect to them, that there are different learning styles and that the technology can adapt to all of them, that technology allows that. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, rebecca schuman and jonathan cole, they have argued-- %$* 13
they put it this way: people learn from each other said jonathan cole. %$* 13
contact is critical, said rebecca schuman. %$* 13
they argue that too much of an education-- %$* 13
too much of education is not just about the answers in the book, but it's about what develops over time in an intimate, close contact, that that is critical and that software can't be the answer for everybody. %$* 13
now, i want to point out that there is a level of nuance to this debate. %$* 13
neither team is deep into their corner where they don't see merit in the other side's argument. %$* 13
the team arguing more clicks, fewer bricks, is not saying, no bricks ever again. %$* 13
and the team on the other side is not saying, "no clicks ever." they concede that around the margin, the team arguing against concedes that around the margins, sure, some online education can be supplemental and useful, and the team on the other side is saying, sure, there needs to be a way to have human contact. %$* 13
and the minerva project that ben nelson is sponsoring builds that in. %$* 13
so let's make it clear that this is not this kind of fight to the death over this issue, but it is a discussion over emphasis. %$* 13
and i think in the emphasis there is a wide gulf. %$* 13
and i think some of that emphasis has to do with faith in technology itself to solve some of the problems. %$* 13
particularly since the side arguing for the motion is saying, well, we're at the dawn of a new era, and you have to see how much it can improve. %$* 13
so i want to put the question to this side that's arguing for the motion and making that point that we're at the dawn of a new era. %$* 13
as you pointed out in the opening, we have heard this before. %$* 13
correspondence courses were going to democratize education, and they didn't. %$* 13
the open university in the united kingdom, no, there were people who had degrees for that, but the great universities of england haven't flinched whatsoever. %$* 13
and the radio courses, et cetera. %$* 13
we've heard that technology was going to change the game dramatically so many times in the past. %$* 13
why is it different this time, ben nelson? %$* 13
well, i would argue it has helped. %$* 547
and i think you have to understand the context. %$* 547
think of the general population educational level in the 1930s around the world. %$* 547
what the radio has done, and television has done, to teach people and some of the information has been dramatic. %$* 547
for example, in india, it's something like a hundred million people have learned to read from a program that adds subtitles to indian soap operas. %$* 547
and the eye naturally learns to read those subtitles. %$* 547
but let me stop you there, ben, just in the interest of time, because my point is that that has not had much impact on the university model, which your partner says hasn't changed forever. %$* 13
correct. %$* 547
why not? %$* 13
it's not interactive. %$* 547
it's broadcast. %$* 547
this is an interactive medium. %$* 547
okay, let me put that to the other side. %$* 13
that the game changer, rebecca schuman, your opponents are saying, is that it's interactive this time. %$* 13
it truly is two-way. %$* 13
it's not a letter through the mail to your professor with your answers. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, the current technology i would say just isn't interactive enough. %$* 549
i think that students lose motivation when they don't have their peers around them to pressure them to go to class. %$* 549
i don't teach online at umslwhere i teach right now, but i have colleagues who do. %$* 549
and they have interactive components, but it still doesn't really engage the students. %$* 549
and when the students start having trouble, they tend to really just give up. %$* 549
anant? %$* 13
i think the big difference this time around is twofold, one is interactivity. %$* 546
and the second big one is exactly the point that my opponents are making, which we can bring online, and it's called peer to peer learning. %$* 546
if you look at facebook and twitter and all of these peer groups where teens and grownups in the billions are interacting with each other online, why can't we bring that? %$* 546
why this scare of technology? %$* 546
let's bring that into our learning education system and fold that in how people learn online so that the peer learning is part of the platform. %$* 546
as on edx, the whole discussion forum is part of the learning process. %$* 546
jonathan cole. %$* 13
well, i'd like to just quote from sherry turkle who wrote a wonderful little book called "alone together." and she's an mit colleague of yours. %$* 548
and she said, "technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities." and as it turns out, we are very vulnerable indeed. %$* 548
we are lonely but fearful of intimacy. %$* 548
digital connections and a sociable robot may offer the illusions of companionship without the demands of friendship. %$* 548
our networked life allows us to hide from each other even as we are tethered to each other which i think often is reflected in the social media and the kinds of contacts that people make through technology. %$* 548
it is not the kind of interaction that students have debating each other in class, involving the individual instructor to force people to confront their biases and presuppositions, to read texts extraordinarily closely, that can be useful in other ways. %$* 548
i don't believe it's possible yet. %$* 548
okay. %$* 13
ben nelson, respond please. %$* 13
well, i encourage all of you after the debate to go and find our student in the audience because she's been on the platform that not only enables that but enables you to have the kinds of debates, the kind of interactions, the kinds of interrogations of students that actually is even more difficult in an off line environment. %$* 547
when you build a platform to teach a hundred thousand students, that's not your goal. %$* 547
your goal is not to build a platform that optimizes for one-on-one debate. %$* 547
when you build a platform that's about bringing the seminar and adding data to pick which two students will be the ones on both sides of the debate, which kinds of analyses should you go back to in class and listen from another section so you can build upon? %$* 547
that makes online seminars even richer. %$* 547
so even though we don't have as many students on those platforms, this resolution is about where the future of universities will go. %$* 547
the technologies are here now. %$* 547
they will get propagated. %$* 547
one of the things that came up-- %$* 548
jonathan cole. %$* 13
in the discussions about moocs in-- %$* 548
certainly in the heyday of excitement about their early inception was that they could reach hundreds of thousands of people. %$* 548
if they reach people in the seminar type of arrangement, with 15 or 20 people, it may be possible to generate some of the kind of discourse that you're talking about. %$* 548
but that's not where the imagery of the moocs really come from. %$* 548
so, remember, i just have to respond to that. %$* 546
anant agarwal. %$* 13
moocs are-- %$* 546
and online learning in this form are two years old. %$* 546
you're comparing it to a thousand-year-old system which has failed. %$* 546
the economic model-- %$* 546
which has failed, the mooc or the thousand-year-old system? %$* 13
the thousand-year-old university system has failed. %$* 546
well, no, it had a long, long run at a thousand years. %$* 13
i wouldn't call that failure. %$* 13
they still don't have an economic model. %$* 546
but the point is that in terms of small seminar, the simple mechanisms are being introduced on the edx platform. %$* 546
it's called a cohort. %$* 546
you can create google instant hangouts and small groups of five and ten people, interact with each other. %$* 546
and it's much more connecting than a professor picking one student out of a class while 300 other students are sitting there twiddling their thumbs. %$* 546
but i don't necessarily want my students to be in charge of each other. %$* 549
i love them. %$* 549
i love them to death. %$* 549
but-- %$* 549
would you mind naming them again? %$* 13
their peer review, you know, they're freshmen, they're-- %$* 549
i got rid of peer review in my class because it was like the inmates were in the prison. %$* 549
it made the papers worse. %$* 549
it made things-- %$* 549
they don't-- %$* 549
they're bright, they're inquisitive, they're great, but they don't quite know enough yet to help each other learn in a way that i can help them learn. %$* 549
that's a really interesting point and i think maybe goes to the whole notion of authority versus the inmates running the asylum as they say. %$* 13
ben, so what about-- %$* 13
is that part of what this conflict is about? %$* 13
well, i think that's a wonderful intelligence squared debate for another time, but we shouldn't conflate the enabling technology with the educational philosophy. %$* 547
the question is, "what can the educational technology provide us-- %$* 547
well i think we should conflate those things. %$* 13
well-- %$* 547
i think it's relevant because she's actually giving a reason why she needs to be there in the classroom, kind of running things. %$* 13
she can be there in a 15-person breakout. %$* 547
so there's nothing preventing the edx platform from having the professor jump from breakout to breakout. %$* 547
that's just a philosophical point of view, right? %$* 547
so your argument really-- %$* 13
the side that's arguing for fewer clicks-- %$* 13
more clicks, fewer bricks, you're talking about-- %$* 13
you're basically-- %$* 13
you have a faith that ultimately the technology can address all or nearly all of the criticisms that are coming from-- %$* 13
nearly all. %$* 547
you have a lot of faith that it's flexible, adaptable, and that it's only learning. %$* 13
absolutely-- %$* 547
all right, i want to take that to the other side. %$* 13
so that's philosophically what your opponents are saying, is that "you ain't seen nothing yet, and you're-- %$* 13
and it-- %$* 13
it's going to be amazing." and i want to sort of get a response from your side about that. %$* 13
jonathan cole. %$* 13
well, i mean, we didn't see anything yet with the .com bubble either, and that kind of exploded, but the technology was worse at the time. %$* 548
i guess that i would also say is that learning does not only take place in the lecture room, and the nature of the bricks that bring people together, part of the learning experience, go far beyond necessarily the lecture room. %$* 548
and part of the subtitle of this debate is really whether or not the format and the structures and even the architecture of the old university setting will be obsolete. %$* 548
and i believe that students learn perhaps almost as much or as much outside of the classroom, interacting in these physical spaces, as they do in the classroom. %$* 548
but, jonathan, they're-- %$* 13
i think your opponents concede that point, but they say that the analogy is that those physical spaces can be created online, that those social interactions can happen online. %$* 13
yeah, well, i do-- %$* 548
i think the-- %$* 548
even the sex can happen online. %$* 13
would you turn me to that program? %$* 548
what's the website? %$* 548
no, i-- %$* 548
well, there i just simply, you know, disagree. %$* 548
i mean, i think that when we are dealing with, let's say, a course that allows you to get answers that are known answers, i have no doubt that this new technology can have an extraordinary influence. %$* 548
but a great teacher, talking about the subtleties of text, about being a perfect reader, of how reading will influence your life, not only in terms of enjoyment, that i think has yet to be demonstrated. %$* 548
this is an assertion by our opponents, our worthy opponents. %$* 548
it is not demonstrated. %$* 548
and as i said earlier, there are a lot of empirical questions that i haven't heard any answers to thus far from my worthy opponents. %$* 548
we're going to come back to some of those, but i want to let anant respond to what you just said. %$* 13
sure. %$* 546
so you mentioned that-- %$* 546
i think you're making a mistake here. %$* 546
you're comparing the best teacher-- %$* 546
i would love to be in your class, rebecca. %$* 546
i think that you would be delightful. %$* 546
with a class of 10 or 15 working with rebecca, that is fantastic. %$* 546
but how many people around the world-- %$* 546
how many children in the u.s. or the rest of the world can afford that kind of luxury, to have a great teacher in a small classroom setting, talking about reading , non-fixed answers at the end of textbooks? %$* 546
we have technology today where we can grade essays using machine learning technology. %$* 546
and if you talk to the teachers in the california school district, they are saying they are giving their children fewer essays because they just don't have the time to grade. %$* 546
i know teachers in high school, i know my wife who teachers, they spend hours and hours grading essays. %$* 546
that is a good thing, and as long as there are teachers like rebecca to grade my essays and give me instant feedback, that is fantastic. %$* 546
but what about all the students where teachers are not able to give essays and writing assignments because they don't have time to grade? %$* 546
we have technology today in experimental form that will be able to grade essays using a machine learning technology. %$* 546
okay, let's let rebecca respond to some of that. %$* 13
rebecca schuman. %$* 13
i mean, i don't like grading essays. %$* 549
i wrote a very popular article in slate about how i would like to stop assigning them because i don't like grading them. %$* 549
but when i grade them, i do grade them pretty fast. %$* 549
essay grading technology is not very good right now. %$* 549
it might get better, but, i mean, when i think about the idea that a robot can replace the nine years of post-college higher education that i had, doing my ph.d., reading 13 hours a day, learning breadth and depth, really just piercing into the inner depths of my brain and scraping around inside it, i have to confront that technological possibility with sheer terror. %$* 549
i don't know if i want to be in a world where a robot can do what i have worked so hard and sacrificed so much and trained so much to do. %$* 549
well, rebecca-- %$* 13
not comparing-- %$* 546
i'm not comparing you. %$* 546
i know, but-- %$* 549
anyone who can %$* 549
but i'm with anant on his point being let's put aside the impact on you and how discouraging that would be to you. %$* 13
what about the impact on your students? %$* 13
of having a robot grade their papers? %$* 549
yes. %$* 13
they’d learn how to game the robot immediately. %$* 549
but the point is not simply writing papers. %$* 548
even the most conservative organization in the world, the college board and the sat, are giving up the essay part of the sat examinations, because they are doing the grading by rote, in effect. %$* 548
they're not nuanced. %$* 548
they're not teaching students how to think for themselves independently, which is a very difficult thing to do. %$* 548
now maybe it is doable through technology, but i haven't seen it demonstrated. %$* 548
well, and again, i do think that we're ratholing on a piece of content. %$* 547
i happen to agree with you both. %$* 547
i mean, i do think that at the very high levels of education you do want people who are expert in the subject to grade essays. %$* 547
that has nothing to do about where the class occurs. %$* 547
to say the professor doesn't sit in front of a lecture hall or even a 10-person class and says hold on a second while i read this paper and grade it, that's not a very interactive format. %$* 547
it's not very engaging. %$* 547
and so the question is what is the cost structure that is going to be built around actually disseminating that education? %$* 547
even in a small format. %$* 547
even in the scenario we believe in. %$* 547
what you actually do want is very tight student/faculty interaction, 15- to 19-person classes. %$* 547
we still opt to use chronology to facilitate the goings on in the classroom, because we think that it can enhance the experience for the student and dramatically lower the cost where you don't need to build buildings and maintain campuses when you can gather the students and have them experience what the world has to offer as opposed to necessarily in a very expensive, very exclusive campus environment. %$* 547
jonathan cole. %$* 13
well, i mean first of all, i think that, you know, educators have done a terrible job, especially at the selective colleges dealing with the issue of costs. %$* 548
i mean, students at harvard graduate with no debt. %$* 548
they have a tremendous endowment. %$* 548
columbia college students graduate with about $6,000 worth of debt, but the sticker price is the only thing that is talked about. %$* 548
so it's not as if those who can't afford it who come from, you know, poor socio-economic backgrounds can't go to these great colleges. %$* 548
i think as a conflation, however, if i can switch a bit, what the purposes are of these moocs. %$* 548
are they to democratize the world as it were, which in some ways may well be hegemonic, who owns knowledge, to reach hundreds of thousands of people? %$* 548
or is it to hold seminars in a different way with 16 or 17 people? %$* 548
those are very different types of issues and questions. %$* 548
it seems to me ben is trying to do one thing and it seems to me that edx is trying to do something slightly different. %$* 548
is that a fair depiction of the two of you? %$* 13
well, absolutely. %$* 546
i think there are different ways of using technology in the classroom. %$* 546
every click is not the same. %$* 546
and ben is using clicks in one way, we're using clicks in another way. %$* 546
i think the point here, the debate is about more clicks and fewer bricks. %$* 546
can we include the classroom experience? %$* 546
can we include the way we teach students? %$* 546
can we teach more students than can have access to a great rebecca? %$* 546
can we create using technology the approach where people can learn from each other through peer learning online? %$* 546
can we access-- %$* 546
can we increase educational access to millions of more students around the world who just don't have access to the rebecca's of the world? %$* 546
and jonathan, let's take-- %$* 13
we just heard anant talk about people not having access. %$* 13
in fact, it is an argument for the moocs. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, you know, if you say don’t have access to the moocs i'm not sure who you're referring to, frankly, but i-- %$* 548
well, let's find out. %$* 13
who are you referring to? %$* 13
i'm referring to all the children and students who cannot afford college or that leave college with huge amounts of debt or that simply don't have access to college. %$* 546
okay, okay %$* 13
and that's a wonderful aim and a wonderful objective that i actually fully endorse, but the evidence that i've seen, and it's bad-- %$* 548
you know, it's not particularly good evidence, empirical evidence, suggests that the people in remote places that can't get to mit, can't get to, you know, amherst or williams or wherever it might be, are people who are already educated. %$* 548
they're the ones who are signing on to these courses and may well be enjoying them, but it's not reaching the population yet that i think would have, you know, it would have very beneficial %$* 548
is that correct-- %$* 13
anant, is that correct? %$* 13
again, i think it's how you play the numbers. %$* 546
so we have 2.2 million learners on edx and of that, 30 percent of the 600,000 are high school and college students. %$* 546
and so just because 70 percent of learners already have a degree doesn't mean that you are still not reaching-- %$* 546
they're reaching more students at the college age and high school level today than the largest university in the united states. %$* 546
and so we cannot-- %$* 546
so we really cannot say that we're not reaching students in the right demographic. %$* 546
we are. %$* 546
and i would add to anant's point that if these universities would actually issue a degree alongside with that, you wouldn't have 600,000 students, you'd have 60 million. %$* 547
that one of the reasons that people don't complete is the same reason that people who sometimes read a textbook from cover to cover decide, hmm, i got to chapter 5.that was good enough. %$* 547
thank you. %$* 547
but there is no point except for interest right now. %$* 547
well, rebecca schuman, do you see the democratization argument that is, to some degree, being made by the other side? %$* 13
well, you know, yes, i think that it does-- %$* 549
the numbers are-- %$* 549
it does reach more people than not having it would reach. %$* 549
but i-- %$* 549
again, i agree with jonathan that it doesn't necessarily reach the kind of people that it had originally intended to reach. %$* 549
and that shows in the corporate directions of edx's two main competitors, coursera and udacity, both of whom have decided to concentrate on corporate training instead of the sort of loftier democratization of education. %$* 549
and it also comes at the expense of people like me. %$* 549
there-- %$* 549
you know, you - - i love that you think that i'm irreplaceable and that everybody should just be in my class, but i am not that special. %$* 549
there are literally over a million low-level professors just like me in the united states right now desperate to reach students, desperate to work, working for-- %$* 549
and what happens to you million if their world comes true? %$* 13
well, i guess we go from working for poverty level wages to working for no wages. %$* 549
we're extinct. %$* 549
i disagree. %$* 547
i think that i would completely disagree. %$* 546
true. %$* 549
is a rising tide that will lift all boats. %$* 546
give you an example of professor jamie l’heureux. %$* 546
she teaches at bunker hill community college in massachusetts. %$* 546
and what she did was her students did not have access to a great computer science class, so she took the online material from one of her introductory computer science classes, and she used that in a blended model in the community class. %$* 546
and she said, if not for the online material from the edx course, she said she never would have been able to teach that course on her campus. %$* 546
and she also said she's irreplaceable. %$* 546
if not for her and her helping with the online material, the students would not have passed the course. %$* 546
so i think teachers are necessary. %$* 546
i think bringing online learning into the classroom can really up-level the whole educational experience. %$* 546
i think you're expecting too much of administration. %$* 549
i think if they have the opportunity to get rid of pretty much all professors, type in moocs from super professors and then use low-paid adjuncts and tas to basically proctor people, they would jump at that. %$* 549
they would do that in a second. %$* 549
maybe not at super elite institutions like this one, but at the regional and directional universities where the vast majority of americans earn their degrees, i just can't see that not happening because it would help the bottom line so much. %$* 549
it would not happen when the supply and demand comes back in balance. %$* 547
right now, too much supply of professors, not enough supply of completing students. %$* 547
a lot of students desire to complete drop out because we don't track their progress. %$* 547
we don't know when we lose them until the final grade. %$* 547
all right. %$* 13
in the future, we'll be able to do that, and therefore there'll be much more demand for adjuncts and therefore salaries will rise. %$* 547
i want to go to the audience now for questions from you. %$* 13
and i want to ask-- %$* 13
the way this will work, especially if you came in late, you raise your hand. %$* 13
we need a microphone to be brought to you. %$* 13
we need you to stand up, tell us your name and ask something that is-- %$* 13
really is a question, not to debate with the debaters, but to ask them a question that gets them debating with one another, and so make it very short and terse. %$* 13
and if it's not on the topic that gets them continuing on this topic, i'll have to pass. %$* 13
sir, right down front here. %$* 13
if you can stand again, thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is and i’m a grad student at nyu. my question is, don't you think that vocational education is more suitable to be online, and while liberal arts courses or materials will be %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
and to some degree, jonathan cole made that point in his opening, but your hasn't responded to the sense of different kinds of-- %$* 13
different kinds of material may lend themselves to different kinds of settings. %$* 13
so i want to-- %$* 13
and one of those settings cannot be online, liberal arts. %$* 13
ben nelson. %$* 13
so i believe that there are different kinds of subject matter that lend itself to different format of student faculty ratios. %$* 547
but the question about whether or not technology can assist, whether it is a large lecture, a small seminar, even a one-on-one tutorial in many cases is clear. %$* 547
now-- %$* 547
you can see-- %$* 13
you can see a creative poetry writing class online? %$* 13
well, there are creative poetry classes online. %$* 547
and both in lecture format and as well as not. %$* 547
and let me tell you-- %$* 547
i don't happen to know the texture of this, but how good an experience is doing poetry online? %$* 13
it's amazing. %$* 547
i think it's phenomenal. %$* 547
i mean, it-- %$* 547
but i'm biased in that answer. %$* 547
i'll tell you where i don't think that online instruction can compare with off line, even though it already is happening. %$* 547
in conservatory instruction, if you are training someone to be a pianist, training someone to be a violinist, very hard to deliver at a very professional level, not suzuki method-- %$* 547
very hard to get that level of nuance and personal guidance - - %$* 547
all right. %$* 13
so i just want to go the side on the-- %$* 13
the other side. %$* 13
so your opponents have argued that there is a small sector of material that doesn't lend itself. %$* 13
you have conceded, i think, that there is-- %$* 13
there are areas that would lend themselves to online learning. %$* 13
jonathan cole? %$* 13
well, i certainly do, and that's why the university of phoenix exists, to raise human capital to the point where some people can get better jobs than they have. %$* 548
and there's no reason why those kinds of enterprises shouldn't exist. %$* 548
i would simply like to raise again, for my worthy opponents, the answer to the empirical questions that i raised at the very beginning: what's the cost model that will work that didn't work in the 1990s? %$* 548
and the various other issues that have to do with intellectual property and the rest. %$* 548
if you don't answer those questions, you're living off the future. %$* 548
let me address the economic-- %$* 546
anant agarwal. %$* 13
model question that you raised. %$* 546
in fact, i think you made an argument against yourself. %$* 546
so you said that moocs cost between a hundred and $300,000 to create. %$* 546
you're absolutely right. %$* 546
they cost between $10,000 and half a million dollars to create. %$* 546
but the second time you offer the mooc, you bring that into your classroom. %$* 546
the third time, the fourth time, it's like a textbook. %$* 546
a text-- %$* 546
for someone who's written a textbook, it took me five years to write the textbook. %$* 546
but then to stamp out a new textbook is, you know, is 50 bucks or a hundred bucks. %$* 546
so repeating is much easier. %$* 546
and the moocs and online education, that’s how it is, the repetition is very cost effective and very high quality. %$* 546
however, in the classroom, i'm not sure what they pay-- %$* 546
you know, professors at columbia or other universities, but i know it's not $14,000. it's certainly on the order of a hundred to $300,000. so in other words, we are teaching-- %$* 546
or we are paying a hundred to $300,000 each time a course is repeated. %$* 546
so therefore, the existing model is broken. %$* 546
with moocs, we can fix that, where the cost of creation is high, but the repetition, that's how you get the scaling of-- %$* 546
okay, jonathan-- %$* 13
jonathan cole, that was an answer to your question. %$* 13
rebecca, do you want to take that? %$* 13
well, i mean, it's-- %$* 549
i-- %$* 549
i enjoy ribbing on tenured people who make too much money as much as the next guy. %$* 549
but the fact is that almost 80 percent of faculty today work off the tenure track. %$* 549
definitely do not make in the six figures, and over half of faculty working today are adjuncts like me who make in the low five figures. %$* 549
most of our salaries begin with a 1 or a 2. %$* 549
and jonathan. %$* 13
i must say that you have given me the perfect reason for retiring faculty. %$* 548
they make their mooc, and they leave the door, and you don't have to pay them again next year. %$* 548
now, if they make two moocs, who owns the property? %$* 548
so the first point about retiring faculty after they create a mooc, of course not. %$* 546
they have to be involved in-- %$* 546
then no one would ever want to make a mooc. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 546
so that would be the self-fulfilling prophecy. %$* 546
anant, we want you to make a mooc now. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 546
so you make a mooc, and then you have to support the mooc.you teach the students. %$* 546
but you're not spending a hundred and $300,000 each time you teach it. %$* 546
you're still teaching it. %$* 546
you're still involved, but to a lesser extent. %$* 546
and the intellectual property question. %$* 13
the intellectual property is very straight forward. %$* 546
actually, i don't see what the issue is. %$* 546
the courses and content, it's like-- %$* 546
we've addressed the problem with textbooks and other course content. %$* 546
so i frankly don't see an issue there. %$* 546
so i would have %$* 546
do the professors own the intellectual property? %$* 548
do they get whatever income might be available from the moocs that are commercial enterprises? %$* 548
so the textbooks, the ip's owned completely by the professor and the publisher. %$* 546
universities are completely cut out from it. %$* 546
and in online education, i think they have the chance to save the university with universities having discussion where three stakeholders can share the ip, not just the publisher and the professor, but the professor, the university and in this case the publisher of the mooc platform like edx. there can be a three-way sharing of ip, which i think is the right way of doing as opposed to the textbook model. %$* 546
i want to go to another question. %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
yeah, my name is noel capon, and i am a professor at columbia. %$* 550
a simple model of the university, is that is in the business of both creating and disseminating information. %$* 550
you know, on this side of the house i've heard nothing about creation. %$* 550
does that mean essentially that the online operations-- %$* 550
but can-- %$* 13
sir-- %$* 13
are freeloaders? %$* 550
can you-- %$* 13
because you were waving the mike, the radio audience-- %$* 13
oh, %$* 550
who just asked question one more time. %$* 13
a simple model of the university is that it both creates and disseminates information. %$* 550
i've heard the online people say nothing about creation. %$* 550
does that mean that you are, in effect, freeloaders on the university system? %$* 550
well, i-- %$* 547
ben nelson. %$* 13
i'm delighted to address that. %$* 547
this debate is not about research. %$* 547
it is about the dissemination of knowledge. %$* 547
it's only about the second part. %$* 547
and-- %$* 547
is that a "yes" to his question? %$* 13
no, it is not. %$* 547
i do think that what you enable when you remove the constriction of the campus environment from not just the student but from the professor is that you can enable much more flexible research. %$* 547
i'll give you a couple of very quick examples. %$* 547
if you do field research, having a university job, we have to show up physically to class nine months out of the year, does not do wonders for your career, especially before you're tenured, or, like my father, who's a molecular biologist and is now doing structural biology, he needs to fly to the particle accelerators in europe every three weeks just so he can shoot photons at his crystals. %$* 547
well, if he were still teaching-- %$* 547
he's emeritus, so he doesn't-- %$* 547
he wouldn't be able to do that, so-- %$* 547
at least in an offline environment. %$* 547
so research can also be dramatically helped by the removal of physical requirements-- %$* 547
physical presence requirements for the faculty. %$* 547
what do you think of that, rebecca, which-- %$* 13
i mean, it doesn't apply specifically to the kind of teaching that you're doing, but you would have a-- %$* 13
you would have the ability, for example, to travel and study and do sabbaticals, et cetera, and still teach. %$* 13
do you like that? %$* 13
i mean, i think-- %$* 549
would you believe in it? %$* 13
for me it sounds great because i'll never have a sabbatical anyway, but i think the few people in my discipline who are left on a tenure track would probably have a heart attack because they'd be like, "oh, i would have to coincide my sabbatical with teaching."yeah, i mean, i have to say with that-- %$* 549
that is so esoteric, but i guess in an esoteric way i don't disagree with the opposite side on this particular thing. %$* 549
i do disagree. %$* 548
i mean, i-- %$* 548
jonathan cole. %$* 13
i'm not at all sure that you have a university if you were that the sole function of that university in terms of bricks rather than clicks-- %$* 548
although clicks will exist in it-- %$* 548
is the research mission and all of the students are basically no longer there. %$* 548
now, the essence of our great universities and our great colleges, whether they're very large state universities or much smaller ones, is that they create knowledge. %$* 548
they create discoveries and inventions. %$* 548
i don't see how taking students out of the laboratory is going to enhance that process since they are the people-- %$* 548
the students-- %$* 548
the postdocs and others, the post-doctoral fellows, they are often doing the bench research and learning from each other through close interaction. %$* 548
you take all the undergraduates away and there are no bricks, i'm not sure what kind of university is left. %$* 548
let me-- %$* 13
let me just say this, and i'll bring the question back to you. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and the point was just made by jonathan cole that a world where universities devolve into institutions that basically do research and all of the undergraduates are off campus, online, is not a university that he would call a university. %$* 13
anant, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
let's be very careful here. %$* 546
i think we're taking some of the best institutions in the world, some really high quality institutions, and tarring the whole world with this utopian brush. %$* 546
the world is not like that. %$* 546
most universities in the world are not research institutions. %$* 546
most colleges in the world, community colleges in the world, and high schools, and places where teaching happens are not research institutions. %$* 546
we happen to be in a research institution which is great. %$* 546
so i think we really need to look at the average, the median, and at universities around the world where education may be the predominant thing that happens. %$* 546
so i dream of a world where we have universities where professors are creating content and also disseminating content, just that they do it differently. %$* 546
it's the same people, but they do it differently. %$* 546
they do it bringing a lot online and so that they can spend a lot of time creating great content which they don't have the time to do because they have to do it every single semester. %$* 546
so now i can really create great content without a huge amount of effort and then focus on interacting with students in ways that i cannot do today. %$* 546
let's go to another question. %$* 13
professor mayer. %$* 13
– you’re a little bit of a ringer, but i think %$* 13
i ask this not on the richman center behalf, but actually because i study real estate, and in the 1990s we heard people say that an online address was actually much more important than a physical address, but we see technology companies like google and facebook locating in the most expensive real estate in the country in the world presumably about the interactions of their employees who are working together and creating together. %$* 18
what's different about the business of education than the business of technology and creativity? %$* 18
ben nelson. %$* 13
i actually don't think it's very different at all. %$* 547
in fact, you can learn from what these companies are doing. %$* 547
if you look at where these companies set up 10 to 15 years ago, they created campuses. %$* 547
google has a campus and they said oh, we're going to provide everything you want here on the campus, free food and laundry and, you know, slides and things like that. %$* 547
and guess what their employees said? %$* 547

sorry. %$* 533
that's okay, no. %$* 13
afterwards, i'm happy to talk some more. %$* 533
i want jared bernstein to debate with the debaters. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 534
if-- %$* 534
first of all, again, these are empirical questions. %$* 534
if i communicate nothing to you tonight, that would be the thing that i'd want to leave you with. %$* 534
you can't make the assumptions that our opposition does about what happens with living wages or minimum wages. %$* 534
and this has been studied, again, fairly carefully, not as much as minimum wages, but living wages have not been found to have the distortionary effects that russ suggested. %$* 534
i do think the questioner gets into a very important point that we haven't touched on yet. %$* 534
if you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot-- %$* 534
because by the way, if it doesn't fall a lot, then it can't possibly have the problems that they're suggesting. %$* 534
that was the point karen made. %$* 534
but if you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot, you will collect fewer payroll taxes. %$* 534
you will have to pay more in food stamps. %$* 534
you will have to pay more in unemployment insurance. %$* 534
you have to pay more in welfare benefits. %$* 534
and it is very much a transfer of the burden of poverty to the taxpayer in ways that minimum wages and living wages help to mitigate. %$* 534
jim dorn. %$* 13
jim dorn. %$* 13
well, i would take just the opposite position. %$* 532
the american dream for most of our grandparents and maybe some of our parents and so forth, was to come to the united states from countries that had repression and so forth. %$* 532
there were no minimum wages. %$* 532
they could get a job. %$* 532
they learned how to speak english. %$* 532
they got on-the-job training, and their families were made better off over time. %$* 532
immigrants coming over here now, if they're low skilled, they're not going to have that opportunity. %$* 532
and teenage workers without a high school degree that might be going to work and getting a job, these people aren't going to get jobs. %$* 532
the card-krueger study did not-- %$* 532
did not look at people that actually lost their jobs from smaller establishments. %$* 532
it was-- %$* 532
they did a survive on franchise restaurants. %$* 532
and they didn't take into account the people that actually lost their jobs. %$* 532
now, these marginal firms don't make a lot of profits. %$* 532
they're making a normal return on investment over the longer period of time. %$* 532
and if they have to pay a higher wage rate, they're going to either fire some workers, or they're going to have less to reinvest in the firm to expand it. %$* 532
other workers who-- %$* 532
sure, some workers gain, they keep their job, but other workers will lose their job and either go in the shadow economy or eventually end up on welfare maybe. %$* 532
so i want more opportunities for workers. %$* 532
and the government, just by saying you're going to pay a higher wage, as if there's no effects, is nonsense. %$* 532
it's like the law of gravity. %$* 532
the law of gravity operates even though leaves may blow up in the wind. %$* 532
the law of demand operates. %$* 532
and when prices go up, people buy less, especially in the long run when they make substitutions. %$* 532
it's just common sense. %$* 532
let me interrupt you to go to a question down here. %$* 13
what does this body language say? %$* 13
you can kind of lean back and-- %$* 13
i'm comfortable. %$* 533
i don't see any fruit. %$* 533
i hear the applause, but i don't see any fruit, so i'm feeling pretty good. %$* 533
all right, good. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
if the goal of the minimum wage is to help low-income earners, which everyone, i believe on both sides has said is a laudable goal, should we as a society make an effort to make that more direct and clear and increase something like the earned income tax credit and make the transfer of wealth direct and clear. %$* 18
for people who don't know what the earned income tax credit is, take one sentence to explain what it does. %$* 13
i believe it is something with, when you have a job, and you have income, you get money back on taxes. %$* 18
okay, if you're below a certain-- %$* 13
threshold. %$* 18
level of income, okay. %$* 13
let's take that to karen kornbluh first, then we'll come back to this side. %$* 13
yeah, the earned income tax credit is a terrific thing. %$* 535
it's for workers who are low income, but i'd say two things about the earned income tax credit. %$* 535
one is we're debating our budget deficit, and i think we just have to be realistic. %$* 535
i'm not sure we're going to increase the earned income tax credit dramatically right now. %$* 535
and i don't think we want to get rid of the minimum wage and rely on that. %$* 535
secondly, i do think there are a lot of people who just want to earn a living. %$* 535
you know, they may appreciate the extra help from the earned income tax credit, but they would like to work for a salary that allows them to support their families. %$* 535
and so i don't think we should underestimate how much people want to get their living from their job. %$* 535
i would just say there are a lot of policies i would prefer to the minimum wage. %$* 533
the earned income tax credit is preferable to the minimum wage. %$* 533
improving our school system is preferable to the minimum wage. %$* 533
and i certainly agree with karen that people like to stand on their own two feet, and i would emphasize, once again, that the minimum wage makes it harder, not easier. %$* 533
we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing out this motion, "abolish the minimum wage." right down front here. %$* 13
the mic is coming up from behind you. %$* 13
it-- %$* 18
my name is daniel. %$* 18
it seems like the pro side is arguing that with no minimum wage it's better for the entire economic system, but i wonder, without a minimum wage, where you have an environment where people can make 50 cents, $1, $1.50 an hour, if that could lead to other economic problems like poverty, which could lead to increased crime? %$* 18
do you not feel that they've actually answered that question? %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
no, seriously. %$* 13
i don't want to take time on it if-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
to me, it's the crux of their whole argument answers your question, but if you would like to take it, either side? %$* 13
they're saying it would-- %$* 18
i mean-- %$* 13
oh, go ahead. %$* 13
no, no, i-- %$* 13
put to this side actually. %$* 13
james dorn. %$* 13
i think most establishments already pay more than the minimum wage. %$* 532
and if the-- %$* 532
if the wage rate dropped for some workers, the lowest of the lower skilled workers, yeah, their wage rate may go down in the short run, but they'll have a job. %$* 532
and their wage rate's not going to stay at a low level forever if they work hard. %$* 532
that's the point. %$* 532
you're pricing these-- %$* 532
the politicians are pricing these people out of the market in the name of doing good. %$* 532
it's a feel-good policy, and the empirical evidence-- %$* 532
the preponderance of empirical evidence supports the idea that raising the wage rate arbitrarily will reduce jobs more so in the long run. %$* 532
there's just a ton of evidence. %$* 532
so it's not just based on the evidence, it's based on common sense, and just looking-- %$* 532
observing reality. %$* 532
you-- %$* 532
i'm sorry. %$* 534
you've got to look at the evidence, and we-- %$* 534
the planners of today's event, i think wisely, decided we shouldn't use powerpoint. %$* 534
that's a-- %$* 534
that's too bad in an evidentiary but i support-- %$* 534
that's because they were trying to be funny. %$* 13
and it's the radio, too, you know? %$* 534
graphs don't work as well on the radio. %$* 534
but what i have here in front of me is a graph that i'll show to anybody afterwards and-- %$* 534
that just frankly contradicts this notion that particularly jim but jim and russ have hit on all night, common sense, common sense-- %$* 534
no. %$* 534
it's not common sense because there are lots of different ways. %$* 534
and i articulated them. %$* 534
you mistakenly said, "these guys think nothing happens when you raise the minimum wage." i gave you three good ps as to the different things that happen. %$* 534
so the dynamics of the economy are such that the questioner is exactly right. %$* 534
you would not find a great deal of increased employment because the minimum wage is not currently a disemploying mechanism within the economy, but what you would find is a ton more poverty. %$* 534
and you have to consider this in the context of the eitc, mr. %$* 534
questioner over there, because if you take a minimum wage that's $7 an hour and you apply a 40 percent eitc to it, you're adding $2.80. %$* 534
you know, again, please don't use the term "eitc." %$* 13
oh, the earned income tax credit, a wage subsidy for low wage workers, if you apply the current wage subsidy to a $7 minimum wage hour, it's 40 percent at the max, that's $2.80. apply that to a $3 wage, which may be where it's going to fall-- %$* 534
russ doesn't know, but it could be. %$* 534
now you're talking about one-twenty-- %$* 534
$1.20 subsidy to that wage. %$* 534
so it's a $2.80 subsidy at the current minimum wage level. %$* 534
if that falls by half then the subsidy falls by half. %$* 534
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to another question, way up on top. %$* 13
sir, if you stand up, again, you'll be seen-- %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
so if-- %$* 18
i know we're on radio, but if you could imagine a graph that shows the distribution of what wages would be without a minimum wage, my guess would be the $7 or $8 minimum wage is close to the low end and that most people would make more than that in the absence of a minimum wage. %$* 18
so if that's the case, then changes to the minimum wage are going to not have much effect, because most people are above that. %$* 18
so the thought experiment would be if the minimum wage were, say, $0.50 an hour, and we're talking about abolishing it, i guess we would probably agree that that would have no effect, because-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
no one would be making that wage. %$* 18
i need you to zero in on the question. %$* 13
so, the question really is is that-- %$* 18
do you-- %$* 18
do both have to believe that's the case, so that we're at a level where it's kind of irrelevant whether it's there or not? %$* 18
and that if it were much higher, if it were $20 an hour, $25 an hour, where most people are making more, would we actually be at a point where the-- %$* 18
where it's relevant and abolishing it or not would make a difference. %$* 18
so, is your question this: are we at a level, if the current minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, that it's so low that abolishing the minimum wage would not actually affect-- %$* 13
well, i'm not saying-- %$* 18
what most people are making? %$* 13
that it would have no effect, but it has minimal-- %$* 18
little. %$* 13
effect, right because it's close to where the minimum would be. %$* 18
and so, the %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
let me go to russell. %$* 13
well, do you want to go first? %$* 13
karen kornbluh. %$* 13
one quick thing. %$* 535
we think that the minimum wage also affects those who earn just above the minimum wage, that it props up wages just above. %$* 535
so if you look at the people who earn at the minimum wage or just above, as i said at the beginning, we have one quarter of all children in the u.s., more than 17 million kids, who have a parent who earns at the minimum wage or just above who we think would be affected. %$* 535
well, i agree. %$* 533
it does-- %$* 533
russell roberts. %$* 13
prop up the minimum wage for-- %$* 533
and it has a bigger effect on the people who just earned it. %$* 533
and that's part of the reason why wal-mart, which pays more than the minimum wage, favors the minimum wage, because it makes their competitors more expensive. %$* 533
it raises the cost to other firms that are smaller and won't-- %$* 533
can't afford to pay as much as wal-mart does. %$* 533
so, i agree with the questioner, though. %$* 533
the level is relatively small, which means it's hard to measure. %$* 533
and the harm is relatively small. %$* 533
but as i started off by saying, for the people who can't find work, it's not small. %$* 533
for the people who aren't worth it, it's very tragic. %$* 533
one more question. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
hi. %$* 536
my name is charlie edelman risking oversimplification-- %$* 536
that's our mission here. %$* 13
it seems to me that the side arguing for the motion is arguing in favor of workers' individual freedom. %$* 536
the side arguing against is arguing for government protection. %$* 536
what elements of the minimum wage debate, isolated from arguments against hours working on the job versus overtime, healthcare benefits, you know, what elements of this debate make it unique, compared to other labor versus business arguments? %$* 536
that's a really good question. %$* 13
that's really good. %$* 13
in other words, are we just having the same old argument over and over again? %$* 13
is this just libertarian versus progressive government argument or is there something else going on, in terms of the minimum wage? %$* 13
is that what you're saying? %$* 13
exactly. %$* 536
all right. %$* 13
it's a really interesting question, actually. %$* 13
who would like to take that on first? %$* 13
james dorn. %$* 13
well, with the minimum wage, there are only so many jobs to go around. %$* 532
it's the old lump of labor fallacy since the wage rate is not allowed to go down if there's a surplus. %$* 532
so you're stuck. %$* 532
and the employers have a lot more power to dictate certain things to workers. %$* 532
they would have more flexibility and more freedom for both the employers and the workers if you got rid of the minimum wage. %$* 532
and i think if you got rid of it, the wage rate wouldn't change that much, because we're pretty close to the-- %$* 532
where the market wage rate would be. %$* 532
that's why politicians don't have large increases in the minimum wage. %$* 532
they can get the political brownie points, a feel-good policy, where most people think that the minimum wage is a good thing. %$* 532
that's why they don't increase it by a lot. %$* 532
when they have increased it by a lot, for example, in new york state, the study that was done-- %$* 532
i pointed to earlier-- %$* 532
it led to fairly significant decrease in employment. %$* 532
it is-- %$* 532
also the empirical evidence, it's just not common sense. %$* 532
there's a lot of empirical evidence on our side of the argument. %$* 532
so, i think jared is unfair to mention that-- %$* 532
he doesn't mention anything about this most recent nber study, which is much more sophisticated than the john smith study that they like to cite. %$* 532
jared bernstein, the guy you called “nuts” just said you're unfair. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 534
so you're even now. %$* 13
ad hominem attack! %$* 534
you're even now. %$* 13
look. %$* 534
jared bernstein. %$* 13
i find the other side's argument on this point just horribly muddled. %$* 534
i'm echoing something karen said earlier. %$* 534
i just don't get it-- %$* 534
i'm not trying to be cute here. %$* 534
i really don't get the logic that says-- %$* 534
it certainly relates to the last question. %$* 534
it's really a small deal. %$* 534
it doesn't really affect many people. %$* 534
but dammit it should be abolished, because it's a big problem and it causes all this unemployment. %$* 534
and you’ve heard them all night, talk about the damaging unemployment effects of the minimum wage. %$* 534
yet somehow, it's-- %$* 534
at the same time, this de minimis policy. %$* 534
those both can't be right. %$* 534
they're logically inconsistent. %$* 534
and i think the reason-- %$* 534
getting to the question, and it was a good question, to me, it's congress's way of saying, “we're not going to let the market drive wages down on our lowest-wage workers to privation-level wages. %$* 534
we don't want to be hong kong. %$* 534
we don't want to be mexico. %$* 534
we don't want to slide down the”-- %$* 534
in economics terms, we don't want to slide down the demand curve the way our opponents would like us to. %$* 534
now, the reason to think that's a bad idea is if it has the negative job loss effects, if it actually distorts the economy in ways that our opponents worry about and claim. %$* 534
let me let russell roberts-- %$* 13
but research says it does not. %$* 534
russell roberts. %$* 13
so horribly muddled, that's in between, i guess, nuts and unfair. %$* 533
it's not too bad. %$* 533
there's a subtlety here, and it's a nice rhetorical flourish here. %$* 533
but i think the argument is that when we say it's relatively small, we're not saying it's unimportant, we're saying it's difficult to measure. %$* 533
it's difficult to tease out the independent effects when many things are happening at the same time. %$* 533
so as a result, when some states are doing well, they raise the minimum wage, and therefore it's hard to figure out what the independent effect is of what's going on underneath. %$* 533
but my question for you is, since you reject the logic that we made, and you say it's only an empirical question, i'd like to know why you think employers over the last 30 years have relentlessly punished not deliberately, but through their actions, have relentlessly punished low-skilled workers because they are relatively unattractive compared to workers outside the united states and automation. %$* 533
do you really think that work-- %$* 533
that employers don't respond to economic incentives? %$* 533
employers have not consistently punished-- %$* 534
jared bernstein. %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 534
did you want-- %$* 534
no, i'm just doing this for the radio so-- %$* 13
sure, yeah. %$* 534
they know who's talking. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 534
thank you. %$* 534
jared bernstein. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
i need to say it when they're not laughing, and when we're not talking. %$* 13
i'm going to hear that in my head now for the next week. %$* 534
i’ll say it one more time. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
did he say that, or i just-- %$* 534
employers have not relentlessly punished low-wage workers. %$* 534
in fact, in the 1990s, a period when the minimum wage was increased in 1996, the unemployment rate among low-wage workers fell to the lowest it had been in 30 years. %$* 534
the national unemployment rate fell below 4 percent. %$* 534
that was the time of welfare reform. %$* 534
and hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly-educated single moms came off welfare, got into the labor market. %$* 534
and with the complimentary boost of the minimum wage and a higher eitc, poverty rates fell very steeply. %$* 534
so, you know, i think you're fundamentally wrong. %$* 534
i'll tell you why employers fight against the minimum wage, because it cuts into their profits. %$* 534
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is “abolish the minimum wage.” %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
this is their last chance to try to change your minds. %$* 13
remember, you voted before the debate. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote again after closing statements. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage terms will be declared the winner. %$* 13
onto round 3, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "abolish the minimum wage." and here to summarize his position against the motion, jared bernstein, a senior fellow at the center-- %$* 13
jared, you can do this one sitting down. %$* 13
that's okay. %$* 13
i've-- %$* 13
let me finish my introduction of you. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
let me finish the introduction. %$* 13
jared bernstein, a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities. %$* 13
for my closing statement, i'd like to get away from the dueling studies and statistics which i'm sorry we have assailed you with, and i apologize to my friends on the other side if i got a little rambunctious. %$* 534
i clearly feel this passionately. %$* 534
but i'd like to get away from that, and i'd like to bring a bunch of other people up here on the stage with me, so to speak. %$* 534
the almost 90 percent of americans earning less than $24,000 a year who support raising the minimum wage, okay? %$* 534
i don't hear an argument from the other side as to why they're wrong and to why they would support, in the interests of their freedom, abolishing a minimum wage that 90 percent of them support. %$* 534
80 percent of americans between 18 and 30 support raising the minimum wage. %$* 534
ten to one among unemployed workers support raising the minimum wage, ten to one. %$* 534
now, earlier russ said something about nobody's mind being changed. %$* 534
that's actually not true. %$* 534
it's true that a lot of people's minds don't get changed. %$* 534
but in fact, this research that we've been talking about, particularly these experimental designs where you can really make pretty fine granular comparisons have changed some minds. %$* 534
the economist magazine now supports increasing the minimum wage. %$* 534
they didn't used to. %$* 534
bloomberg news, cranes new-- %$* 534
cranes new york business is very much a business, a journal; the costco ceo, the starbucks ceo, even mitt romney. %$* 534
mitt romney, during the republican said we should index the minimum wage to inflation, not abolish it, index to-- %$* 534
which by the way makes sense from-- %$* 534
i think he was speaking like a business guy. %$* 534
what you don't want to see is these surprise increases along the way. %$* 534
you'd like to see it indexed. %$* 534
and that, by the way, is part of the president's proposal. %$* 534
so, yes, raise the minimum wage, index the minimum wage. %$* 534
vote against-- %$* 534
vote no on abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 534
it is a cruel, far out of the mainstream idea whose time has not come and never will. %$* 534
thank you, jared bernstein. %$* 13
our motion is abolish the minimum wage,” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion to abolish, russell roberts, a research fellow at the hoover institution. %$* 13
in september of 2011, the governor of american samoa traveled 7,000 miles to testify for five minutes in front of congress. %$* 533
he begged congress to stop increasing the minimum wage in american samoa, a process that had begun in 2007 and was scheduled to increase until it reached the u.s.minimum of $7.25.in 2009, employment on american samoa fell 19 percent. %$* 533
that's because employment in the tuna canning industry, which was a third of their jobs, had fallen 55 percent. %$* 533
the governor of american samoa who came to testify blamed that collapse on the minimum wage. %$* 533
and here's a quote from him, his testimony, "we are watching our economy burn down. %$* 533
we know what to do to stop it. %$* 533
we need to bring the aggressive wage cost decreed by the federal government under control. %$* 533
our job market is being torched, our businesses are being depressed. %$* 533
our question is this: how much does our government expect us to suffer? %$* 533
” i have the same question for those two support the minimum wage here in the united states. %$* 533
how much do you expect the least skilled among us to suffer? %$* 533
congress did stop increasing the minimum wage in american samoa, thank goodness. %$* 533
they should have the same compassion for workers here in the united states and abolish the minimum wage here. %$* 533
right now, there are people within a few blocks of where we're sitting who cannot find work simply because their skills are not worth $7.25 an hour. %$* 533
why would you condemn those men and women to a wage of zero? %$* 533
why would you cut off the bottom of the economic ladder and deprive a human being of the chance to begin a life of honest work? %$* 533
there are desperate people among us, people who have nowhere to turn, whose job prospects are poor. %$* 533
why make their lives worse? %$* 533
it's not just about the money. %$* 533
it's about giving people a chance to find meaning and satisfaction from standing on their own two feet. %$* 533
give the least skilled among us the chance they deserve. %$* 533
abolish the minimum wage. %$* 533
thank you, russell roberts. %$* 13
our motion is "abolish the minimum wage,” and here to speak against the motion to abolish, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
she is the former u.s. ambassador to the organization for economic cooperation and development. %$* 13
thanks so much, john. %$* 535
thanks for moderating this. %$* 535
i want to say a few things. %$* 535
one, abolishing the minimum wage would hurt real people and real kids. %$* 535
a third of those who would be hurt are parents. %$* 535
one-tenth are single parents. %$* 535
more women than men would be hurt; 55 percent of those who benefit from the minimum wage are female. %$* 535
the average minimum wage worker contributes fully half of her or his household's entire income. %$* 535
minimum wage laws do not seem to affect employment very much. %$* 535
studies suggest that other factors, such as the overall state of the economy, how local industries are doing, matter a lot more for employment than the level of the minimum wage does. %$* 535
several states have minimum wages above the federal minimum. %$* 535
there are no signs that the higher rates lead to higher unemployment. %$* 535
abolishing the minimum wage would hurt inequality, it would make it worse. %$* 535
and it would hurt social mobility. %$* 535
it would make it harder for children of low-income families to get ahead. %$* 535
this is very personal for me. %$* 535
my grandmother was a single parent. %$* 535
she raised four kids. %$* 535
fortunately, she had the minimum wage. %$* 535
at that point, it had become the law of the land. %$* 535
and she was able to send her kids to school. %$* 535
i'd like the single mom of today to have the opportunity to keep her family together, get her kids through school. %$* 535
we should restore the american dream. %$* 535
we should not undermine it. %$* 535
we should not abolish the minimum wage. %$* 535
thank you, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
that's our motion, "abolish the minimum wage." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion to abolish, james dorn, vice president for academic affairs at the cato institute. %$* 13
markets don't lead to privation; markets lead to prosperity. %$* 532
historical evidence shows this. %$* 532
a mexican immigrant came over to the united states not too long ago. %$* 532
he couldn't get a job because he was illegal probably. %$* 532
but he did get a job eventually in san francisco at below minimum wage at a chinese laundry. %$* 532
he worked there for a couple years, then he went to georgia. %$* 532
he worked in the slaughter house at a little bit higher wage rate. %$* 532
and now he owns a chain of mexican restaurants in georgia. %$* 532
he had a dynamic and had a dream to come here to find an opportunity. %$* 532
if he would've obeyed the law and the employer obeyed the law, he would've never had that opportunity. %$* 532
a friend of mine was making $0.72 an hour when he first started work. %$* 532
that was his first job. %$* 532
he rose up and became a very, very successful businessman. %$* 532
he said that first job gave him work habits and a lifelong dream of basically being his own boss, making his own decisions, not relying on the government to increase his wage. %$* 532
the minimum wage decreases opportunities for low skilled workers in low income families. %$* 532
we need to abolish the minimum wage, not increase it. %$* 532
there's a better way to help the poor than the minimum wage. %$* 532
thank you, and that concludes our closing statements and round 3 of this debate, and now it's time to learn which side you feel argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
we're going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
reminding you, if you're for this side, you push number one. %$* 13
if you are for abolishing the minimum wage, you push number one. %$* 13
if you are against, push number two. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys, and just correct an incorrect vote, and it'll be-- %$* 13
it'll lock in your last vote. %$* 13
so again, it looks like that worked really well. %$* 13
so i just want to say a couple of things. %$* 13
first of all, just the quality of the debate that we heard here tonight, you know, i-- %$* 13
you know, any jokes about oversimplification aside, the fact is that what we aspire to at intelligence squared is actually a fair, and nuanced, and intelligent debate. %$* 13
and i really have to congratulate these debaters for bringing that tonight. %$* 13
i want to applaud both sides. %$* 13
it didn't-- %$* 13
it did not get ad hominem, and it was really very respectful, and it actually is clear that you all know and like each other. %$* 13
so we appreciate that you did that. %$* 13
also, for those of you in the audience who asked questions, there was not a clunker question, and there were some really excellent ones, so i want to thank you as well for those questions. %$* 13
i also would like to thank wamu for partnering with us on this debate, and definitely you'll be able to hear this debate and several of our other ones coming up on wamu throughout the season. %$* 13
we'd like you to tweet about this debate, as i said, at the beginning. %$* 13

our next debate will be-- %$* 13
we'll be back in new york on wednesday, april 17. the motion is this, "the gop must seize the center or die." everybody jump on a plane now. %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
you want to come back, and i'll debate that one as well? %$* 13
arguing in support of the motion for the gop to reconfigure is david brooks, an op-ed columnist for the new york times; mickey edwards, a former republican congressman from oklahoma. %$* 13
arguing against that motion, laura ingraham, host of the "laura ingraham show"; and ralph reed, chairman and founder of faith and freedom coalition. %$* 13
we will-- %$* 13
i'm happy to-- %$* 13
very happy to say that we will be back in washington next month actually. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and in that case we'll be doing a partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
mccain institute has been running a series of terrific debates and discussions for the last several months. %$* 13
and we are hugely honored to be partnering with them on that. %$* 13
the motion in that case-- %$* 13
we're going to be looking at the issue of how spending cuts will affect national security. %$* 13
we're doing it on the 22nd of may, and the motion language is this, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies."if you would like to hear more about our future debates, and if you'd like to throw ideas at us, we are very open to them, our website is www.iq2us.org. %$* 13

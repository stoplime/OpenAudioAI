it’s one thing if you’re making five hundred thousand dollars a year. %$* 160
let’s say you’re making some multiple of an average american’s salary, where if you do that for ten years, you’re, you know, you’re very well off. %$* 160
it’s another thing if one good year makes your life and “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) makes your children’s lives. %$* 160
it really skews your incentives. %$* 160
john steele gordon. %$* 13
i just want to point out that nell has said that wall street spent six hundred million dollars lobbying washington for regulations that wall street liked. %$* 161
i’m sure that’s perfectly true. %$* 161
on the other hand, washington took the money and produced the regulation. %$* 161
nell? %$* 13
you know what? %$* 164
washington has its own market system. %$* 164
and, people have got to get re-elected. %$* 164
that’s what accountability is. %$* 164
yeah, they took the money. %$* 164
but, you know, you’re blaming the victim there. %$* 164
nell, do you want to respond to the audience response? %$* 13
yeah, sure. %$* 164
if, look, if-- %$* 164
the victims are the people who pay taxes here. %$* 32
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) if you want to, if you want to make this about campaign finance reform, i’d be happy to turn this into that debate and i’d be happy to come back and have that debate. %$* 164
i’m totally in favor of that. %$* 164
but the united states is the only country in the world that has this level of corruption coming into politics from money because this is the only country in the world that doesn’t free television time and forces politicians to buy the time. %$* 164
so you want to take money out of politics, i think that would be a great thing. %$* 164
i think it would be hugely beneficial in washington, believe me. %$* 164
but you cannot blame, you cannot blame washington for the fact that all this money comes in from wall street. %$* 164
you know, washington might be corrupt but you have to think about the international dimension of this phenomenon. %$* 163
there are many countries with totally different laws about lobbying and so on and there have been about fifty banking crises in the last twenty years and have occurred in very different political regimes. %$* 163
and if there is something in common among all of them, it’s that in most of these cases you had a controlled financial system and then deregulation occurred too fast and in ways that did not provide prudent regulations provision of the financial system. %$* 163
as i said, you know, capitalism is based on greed. %$* 163
greed is just “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) about incentive, about maximizing returns. %$* 163
we’re all greedy, you know. %$* 163
first of all, you said you are the only one from washington. %$* 163
i spent two years at the white house in treasury and also ran a successful business. %$* 163
so i know about policy. %$* 163
i also know about business. %$* 163
i tell you, in my business i’m greedy and i react to incentives but i want public policy to be setting rules and regulations so that i don’t misbehave and i don’t cheat and i don’t lie – %$* 163
please, let me bring, – %$* 13
and i don’t take excessive risks with taxpayers’ money because— %$* 163
niall, niall ferguson. %$* 13
your teammate, niall. %$* 13
nell, i’m still struggling to understand how the recipients of bribes are victims. %$* 158
i’m sorry. %$* 158
i have to tell you, you’re, i’m afraid your moral gps just broke down on you there. %$* 158
let me just say, let me just say that this is abso-- %$* 158
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) it is not a . %$* 164
and in fact, if you look at the lobbying statistics you’ll see that half of the people that took the money voted against them anyway, which is part of politics, too. %$* 164
but the point is, as you well know, people ran. %$* 164
well, hang on. %$* 158
people ran for office and were elected on policies of deregulation. %$* 164
and – %$* 164
hang on one moment. %$* 158
okay. %$* 164
you’ve hit the nail on the head here. %$* 158
aig, p-i-g, aig spent 9.7 million dollars on federal lobbying last year, in one year. %$* 158
and that was down on the previous year. %$* 158
it’s contributed directly to candidates, to elected officials and parties, 9.3 million dollars since 1989.it would have been much more but for campaign finance limits. %$* 158
and the top recipients of the money include the chair of the senate finance committee and the chair of the senate banking committee. %$* 158
now, if that doesn’t tell you that “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) something is morally rotten at the heart of washington, i don’t know what we have to show you. %$* 158
if it doesn’t tell you that something is-- %$* 164
jim, jim, i want to – jim chanos, you contrarian you have been sitting there silently on the side against the motion. %$* 13
well, just because the keystone kops couldn’t catch the gang that couldn’t shoot straight, doesn’t absolve that gang from its guilt. %$* 162
in-- %$* 162
in not only looting the system with material intent but materially abrogating their fiduciary responsibility to their clients and the nation. %$* 162
i want to, look, i want to bring the audience, you the audience into it at this point. %$* 13
and it’ll take us about twenty-five seconds to get a sense of how many hands are up and we’ll come to you with microphones. %$* 13
but we would love to bring you into this conversation now and by your responses already you are a terrific, a terrific audience. %$* 13
so where is a, let’s bring one down to the center, to the gentleman in the blue tie. %$* 13
i have a question for mr. %$* 9
ferguson. %$* 9
i believe you said that you “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) don’t believe in more regulation, only in smarter regulation. %$* 9
but eliminating lobbying is that part of smarter regulation and if so, do you know a constitutional way to do it? %$* 9
well, the regulation that seems to be more important than that, actually, has to do with bank capital adequacy. %$* 158
i don’t think one can simply say that this financial crisis is a result of lobbying. %$* 158
that would be a stretch. %$* 158
this crisis is much more to do with excessive leverage. %$* 158
and if one simply regulates bank capital adequacy better, moves away from the self-regulation of basel i and basel ii, i think many of the problems will be resolved. %$* 158
i’ve written on this-- %$* 158
can i finish now? %$* 158
i mean, i know you’re eager to have at me and i always welcome interruptions. %$* 158
i just want to remind you that the victims in the crime that we’re discussing here are the taxpayers and voters of the united states who are now on the hoop for, what? %$* 158
, nine trillion dollars? %$* 158
now, i’ve written actually on the subject-- %$* 158
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) . %$* 158
of campaign finance reform. %$* 158
and it seems to me extremely problematic. %$* 158
you know, it’s been cited, i don’t know where you got this evidence from, nell, that most other countries in the world don’t have this problem. %$* 158
this is completely untrue. %$* 158
the problem of corruption is endemic in most countries and the united states is very far from being the worst. %$* 158
people talk about the brics – brazil, russia, india, china – all vastly more corrupt than the united states. %$* 158
the exceptions are a tiny number of countries in europe, which for cultural reasons, seem not to suffer from chronic corruption. %$* 158
those countries do not suffer from chronic corruption – not because of regulation. %$* 158
there are many, many regulations that restricts lobbying and campaign finance in europe. %$* 158
and in some european countries they work and in others they don’t at all and they’re simply circumvented. %$* 158
so don’t delude yourself. %$* 158
you can’t simply fix the problem of financial crises by eliminating political finance. %$* 158
you don’t mean, are you saying that there was no lobbying involved in reducing the capital requirements? %$* 164
there was tremendous lobbying involved. %$* 164
on the contrary. %$* 158
i couldn’t agree more. %$* 158
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i’d like to see alex berenson, who has been patient, now. %$* 13
no, i think what we all would agree on is that in a very real way, wall street has set the conditions of its own regulation in the last fifteen years. %$* 160
and clearly, that has gone too far. %$* 160
and washington, i mean, to me, seems to work best when there are two strong sides debating an issue. %$* 160
when it came to deregulating the banks there really wasn’t anybody saying, don’t do it. %$* 160
i mean, there were a few people who didn’t have any money. %$* 160
but the commercial banks wanted it and the investment banks went along with it and nobody really disagreed. %$* 160
so when you have a condition where the industry is essentially creating its own regulation, that’s no regulation. %$* 160
and then it falls even more on the people, the executives, the managers in that industry to act like adults, which they did not do. %$* 160
niall ferguson. %$* 13
one, one question’s for you, alex. %$* 158
you represent the fourth estate here, the press. %$* 158
what, where was the press when these things were being done? %$* 158
i don’t remember extensive coverage of the relaxation of bank capital adequacy “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) rules in 2004 in the new york times. %$* 158
but perhaps i missed that krugman column. %$* 158
let’s go back to some questions and i just want to point out the last question was a perfect example of a question. %$* 13
let’s follow that model toward the top. %$* 13
a gentleman who caught my eye, and that’s you reaching for the microphone. %$* 13
yes, thank you. %$* 9
to go quickly from euphemisms, washington being one, wall street being another – and to just not single out poor old bernie madoff as being the villain of the moment, can we have from the panel some of the names of the human beings who were me. %$* 9
behind the mechanisms that created this problem-- %$* 9
such people as likely as chuck schumer, barney frank, chris dodd and others of that ilk. %$* 9
i mean on the—you can also name stan o’neal and chuck prince, and frank raines, and dick fuld, i mean, you know, you can name the guys who took home, collectively, billions of dollars in the last five years. %$* 160
john steele gordon just because you haven’t spoke in a while, would you like an in on this? %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) %$* 13
frank raines of course was a washingtonian to his fingertips. %$* 161
and— %$* 161
he’s the ceo of a public corporation. %$* 164
a public corporation that had unique tax advantages, and had an implicit government guarantee, even though legally there was no guarantee but it was implicit, and of course when they did collapse, the government came up and bailed them out. %$* 161
which is why they were able to borrow money at below-market rates, i mean so it was a—you know, fannie and freddie were economic chimeras created in washington by the government, for purposes of making the government books look better. %$* 161
and then they ended up with this beast. %$* 161
question from the far top. %$* 13
there, in the impetus for what happened, there’s been a lotta talk about greed, on the side of the %$* 9
folks arguing for the resolution, um, as an excuse. %$* 9
i’d like to hear you address the question though of incompetence. %$* 9
there— %$* 9
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) you said incompetence—? %$* 13
incompetence. %$* 9
a lot of these companies, they didn’t just take risks, they weren’t just greedy, the leadership was incompetent, they ran their companies into the ground. %$* 9
they’re bankrupt. %$* 9
and also because of the risk to the rest of the country and the world economy, taxpayers have bailed them out. %$* 9
what about this question of incompetence. %$* 9
thank you. %$* 13
to which side are you addressing your question— %$* 13
oh, the—for the motion. %$* 9
for the motion. %$* 13
wait— %$* 163
nouriel— %$* 13
—i would not, you know, we know there are these issues in corporate governance because in any corporation, the shareholders cannot control the actions of the managers, there is information the manager might want to maximize the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) rents and that leads to distortions, you know, the manager might short of compensation and benefits, at the expense of the shareholders, but again, you know, alan greenspan, and he—when he made his testimony, he made the admission, he said—he admitted that one big mistake he thought that he made was that he thought the shareholders of companies could control the behavior of bankers and managers and because of that he didn’t think it was necessary to further regulate this financial institution. %$* 163
for 30 years of corporate finance literature, that talk about these agents’ problem between principle and agents when there is information. %$* 163
it’s well-known for chicago, to mit, to anywhere else. %$* 163
and he was clueless about it, how could he be clueless. %$* 163
if he’d known about it, there were regulation that could have minimized those distortions of compensation, of information, of taking excessive risk through leverage, controls through more liquidity, to reducing certain type of incentive. %$* 163
they were clueless about it. %$* 163
nell minow, do i see you again agreeing with your opponents? %$* 13
i think, listen, as i said there’s a lotta blame to go around, there’s a lot of incompetence to go around but when paul volcker says that he does not understand the derivative securities it seems to “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) me we should have a paul volcker rule that if paul volcker does not understand it you should not be able to sell it. %$* 164
and a question from the center. %$* 13
and in 2000 we decided to completely deregulate any credit derivatives. %$* 163
they should be over the counter, not on exchange, no settlement rules, no clearing rules, no counterpart rules, nothing. %$* 163
that was a mistake of policy, there were people in policy, the cfdc were against it and sec, the fed, everybody else said no. %$* 163
should be a free market not regulated and that led to the disaster— %$* 163
but— %$* 160
—of credit derivatives %$* 163
but dr. %$* 160
doom— %$* 160
alex berenson— %$* 13
—wouldn’t that have—wouldn’t that have just driven— %$* 160
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09)—policy procedure, we could have put them on an exchange— %$* 163
but if we had done that, wouldn’t the firms have just traded those overseas. %$* 160
no, because, that’s why you have international rules and we have rules about avoiding— %$* 163
so it’s— %$* 160
—that jurisdictional you do— %$* 163
so it’s now brussels— %$* 160
—we do %$* 163
—is the problem? %$* 160
huh? %$* 163
it’s now brussels that we’re debating— %$* 160
listen, capital, we have international rules, there is a “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) agreement, there has to be coordination of international regulatory policy, ‘cause otherwise things are gonna go offshore. %$* 163
but instead of cracking down on offshore centers, we’re stimulating them, that was again a mistake of policy— %$* 163
jim chanos. %$* 13
well, actually after ltcm in 1998, jerry corrigan and others were charged with the effect of looking at credit derivatives, and basically went to the industry, who went down the self-regulatory route for clearing and other mechanisms. %$* 162
so again we have a case of washington going to the industry and the industry doing what it could, to drag its feet or skirt—skirt what was probably good policy all along. %$* 162
okay, we are halfway through the head-to-head par—round of the debate. %$* 13
the motion is “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” i’m your moderator, john donvan, and we are now going to the center for a question. %$* 13
that’s for the against-the-motion side %$* 9
it seems that incentives is like one of the main issues here. %$* 9
compensation’s been crazy, and incentive—incentive’s misplaced, it’s been all over the place, how do you change that, if not by better regulation, how do you “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) change human nature, which is basically like, they’ve been bending the rules, they’ve been swinging, as roubini mentioned, he’s gonna be greedy in his business, i would be greedy in my business, i would do whatever it takes to maximize my profits and that’s what they’ve been doing, if it’s not about better regulation how do you, how do you really like, how do you change it? %$* 9
are you—are you literally asking how do you change human nature? %$* 13
no, no— %$* 164
i—that seems to be— %$* 9
in a way you are— %$* 13
—how to change the incentive— %$* 9
and i think maybe it’s a rel—quite relevant question— %$* 13
how to change, how do you change like how people are, the models and how people are doing— %$* 9
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i see heads being put together on this one. %$* 13
aside from— %$* 160
alex berenson— %$* 13
aside from alcohol i don’t know— no %$* 160
i, no, i think that’s a really good question. %$* 160
as i said at the very beginning of my statement, that is not the question we’re debating, tonight. %$* 160
we’re debating whether or not these firms should have behaved better, under the regime that they had. %$* 160
that said, i do think—i mean i think that what niall says about increasing capital requirements is at the core, it’s a very, very good idea. %$* 160
i can imagine, and i don’t know whether this could work in reality, there’d have to be some very, very smart people to figure out if it could work— sort of a dual system where there’s one group of very, very heavily regulated, essentially postal banks, that have, that have explicit government guarantees of insurance, that offer sort of plain vanilla products, that are, you know, essentially national, quasi-national institutions. %$* 160
and then there’s another group where, anything goes. %$* 160
and you can make or lose whatever you want, you can pay your employees whatever you want, but if you go under, you are not getting one dime and “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) that is the explicit charter that you’re operating under. %$* 160
and the difficulty is figuring out how those two systems would interface. %$* 160
but if you could do that, then, hopefully we could avoid this problem in the future. %$* 160
john steele gordon. %$* 13
i don’t know about human nature, i don’t—you can’t change it. %$* 161
i mean that’s virtually by definition. %$* 161
but i think it was frances bacon who said that to rule nature you must first obey it. %$* 161
and what we have to do is simply understand human nature and take it into account when we set up our rules. %$* 161
one thing about compensation, is that it’s been very fashionable in the united states for years now to have the ceo also be the chairman of the board. %$* 161
which makes him his own boss. %$* 161
and whenever you are your own boss, you are going to overpay yourself. %$* 161
they—yeah, the ceo stuffs the board with people who are dependent upon him, other high-level management, i mean it seems to me that a corporation, unless you have enough stock to justify a seat on the board, if you work for that corporation you shouldn’t sit on the board. %$* 161
nouriel. %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) there is a regulatory capture in almost every industry, the lobbyists take over the regulators and change things into their own interest. %$* 163
but there’s only one industry, the financial industry, in which this thing leads, over and over again, to financial crisis, banking crisis. %$* 163
they’re a disaster, they cost trillions of dollars. %$* 163
and ask yourself what happens, and why that happens. %$* 163
it happens for two reasons. %$* 163
one because banks have deposit insurance and deposit guarantees. %$* 163
should we take some of the asset people money, you leverage like crazy, do crazy things. %$* 163
if you gain it’s your money, otherwise it’s the taxpayer. %$* 163
two, we have lender of last resort support. %$* 163
when banks get in trouble the fed comes to the rescue, and it’s a variant of this moral hazard of the bailout. %$* 163
and that’s why these banking crises occur over and over and over again, and they’re becoming more disrupting, more expensive and so on. %$* 163
that has to do key, with exactly our regulatory system, there is something wrong about it and if we don’t fix it these things are gonna happen, and the costs are gonna come even bigger, again, people are greedy in every industry, people in every industry try to avoid regulation sometimes with lies, sometimes by cheating or avoiding, whatever. %$* 163
that’s human nature, why it leads to disaster in financial industry, because we have the system. %$* 163
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) sir, you have, you have the microphone in your hand, go ahead, please. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 9
this is addressed to both groups. %$* 9
so it seems to me to reflect on which group deserves more blame, we have to make some assumptions and i think the participants are making assumptions, about what is behavior that’s reasonable to expect from one group or another group. %$* 9
and then the one—the group that departs further from those reasonable expectations, gets more of the blame. %$* 9
but i don’t think everybody agrees on what can reasonably be expected from each of the groups. %$* 9
so, it’s assumed that, by some people, that you can reasonably expect greedy behavior, uh, from, uh, wall street types or from the people in that business, but not that it’s reasonable for congress people in the political game to try to do things to keep—this is nell minow’s point of course— %$* 9
niall ferguson who’s— %$* 13
so— %$* 9
—arguing for the motion— “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) %$* 13
—so how do you decide which are the reasonable expectations from the different groups, and won’t that tilt very strongly what blame you assign. %$* 9
niall ferguson— %$* 13
this isn’t— this isn’t rocket science. %$* 158
one set of people under discussion, owes a duty to the public interest. %$* 158
those are the politicians and regulators. %$* 158
that is why we call them public servants. %$* 158
and the other group, let us take the investment bankers, because of course, wall street is composed of many different institutions, but let’s take the investment bankers. %$* 158
they owe a duty, to their shareholders, and also to bondholders. %$* 158
now it’s quite interesting though the point hasn’t been made yet, that to all of these investment banks performed equally badly. %$* 158
the fate of bear sterns and lehman brothers illustrates that egregious bad management can achieve. %$* 158
but the performance of goldman sachs was really significantly different. %$* 158
goldman actually didn’t lose substantial amounts of money, though its shareholders have certainly taken some punishment. %$* 158
and the punishment has been meted out by the market, to the people who invested in those banks. %$* 158
they will almost certainly end up with nothing, i’m fairly clear, that those people who invested in “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) financial securities will end up with very little indeed. %$* 158
and i think that’s particularly true in the case of the big commercial banks. %$* 158
but, niall— %$* 160
and can—can i finish— %$* 158
—that is exactly the point— %$* 160
—‘cause this is a really important point, bank of america, and and of course citigroup. %$* 158
but the interests of the public are to be defended by people in washington. %$* 158
that is the big difference between these two groups, and that is absolutely clear, that we have to lay the blame on washington. %$* 158
the failure of bear stearns, was a disaster from the point of view of people who invested in it. %$* 158
but it became a disaster for the entire us economy, and indeed the world economy, because of failures of regulation. %$* 158
and those seem to me to lie very squarely in washington d.c. %$* 158
a question from the— %$* 13
i think you’ve just proven the point— %$* 160
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09)—woman in the center, please— %$* 13
—that not every bank, failed, not every bank behaved equally badly— %$* 160
this is alex berenson speaking. %$* 13
go ahead, alex. %$* 13
not every bank is as responsible as every other bank for this crisis, goldman is gonna get by a—you know, goldman’s gonna get along fine, there are gonna be commercial banks that get along fine. %$* 160
it helps that aig has been bailed out of course— %$* 158
well, that’s true, that’s true— %$* 160
—let’s not lose sight of that. %$* 158
but— %$* 160
the twist in the tale. %$* 158
but wouldn’t you agree that that shows that there were “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) distinctions made on the street? %$* 160
ma’am, i encourage you to break in to this exchange— %$* 13
okay— %$* 10
—with your question. %$* 13
i—i know that given all the discussion about greed at financial institutions many of us would assume that there were many good people at these companies who were simply afraid to say something about what they saw. %$* 10
and my question is for anyone on the panel, can you envision a way to effectively institutionalize a financial company employee’s ability to report irregularities or essentially poor practices— %$* 10
i think there’s a— %$* 160
— in ways that couldn’t be, that, that you can’t, simply avoid— %$* 10
i’m not really sure i agree with that, i mean there were not whistle-blowers jumping up and calling the new york times to tell us about things, and even enron, and jim knows, you know, jim certainly knows more about enron than anybody— the “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) whistle-blowers really were a— %$* 160
yeah, very, very late in the game— %$* 160
also sarbanes-oxley gives huge, huge protections to whistle- blowers and incentives to whistle-blowers. %$* 164
so i really don’t think that’s the problem. %$* 164
ma’am, you can follow up. %$* 13
take the microphone to follow up just so we hear you. %$* 13
that’s a very risky thing to do to be a whistle-blower to the new york times, if there are—there could be other ways in which confidentiality for employees is protected. %$* 10
and there is under sarbanes-oxley. %$* 164
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) %$* 164
okay, but not %$* 10
okay, but, there probably are still— %$* 10
okay, i—i—i— %$* 13
—better ways to do it— %$* 10
—i can’t let you get into the debate but thank you for the point, i wanna go to the young man in the front row, please. %$* 13
i have a question for mr. %$* 9
chanos? %$* 9
you said earlier that, the government has never uncovered corruption, uh, i believe for the past 20 years which is it’s all done by journalists, and short firms. %$* 9
but does it—would that mean that washington is at fault and granted, these companies shouldn’t have been corrupted in the first place. %$* 9
but %$* 9
wouldn’t—if they’re given the opportunity, wouldn’t it make sense they would, they would abuse, wouldn’t it be foolish to assume that they wouldn’t abuse this power that they have? %$* 9
question mark, thank you. %$* 13
that’s a good question. %$* 13
well %$* 162
let’s just look at the response of this crisis. %$* 162
in following, immediately following what bear—the demise of bear sterns, you “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) had the ceo’s of our major banks and brokerage troop down to washington. %$* 162
what are the two things they requested, from washington, following this stunning collapse almost out of the blue of one of our major brokerage firms. %$* 162
was it tightened regulatory surveillance, was it more regulators on the trading desk, was it something like that, no. %$* 162
they asked for two things. %$* 162
they asked for short selling to be stopped, or curtailed, and they asked for a loosening in the accounting rules. %$* 162
and on both cases, one was done, and changed, the other’s under consideration now. %$* 162
so rather than tightening up things and making things more transparent, and giving incentives to market forces like short sellers, to ferret out fraud, and malfeasance, what has wall street done? %$* 162
it’s come running to washington to ask for more help, and more obfuscation and more opacity. %$* 162
and that’s about as telling as you get. %$* 162
does the side for the motion wanna respond to that? %$* 13
john steele gordon. %$* 13
washington could say no. %$* 161
all right, short and sweet. %$* 13
gentleman at the top? %$* 13
both sides acknowledged i think that one of the major questions “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) here is who’s more to blame. %$* 9
so i wanna try to make it, maybe philosophical, and go back to the keystone kop examples, my question’s for against the motion. %$* 9
so let’s take the keystone kops, couldn’t catch the gang, doesn’t make the gang less culpable. %$* 9
obviously everyone’s gonna agree. %$* 9
but given that the job of the keystone kops in the first place, given the job they’ve taken on, is to keep order, if they’re asleep or corrupt, maybe drunk, aren’t they therefore even more wrong than the people who in the first place committed the action who had no responsibility, fiduciary duty, whatever you wanna call it, who had no responsibility beyond what they’ve signed to but whom— are not nearly in the same position %$* 9
thank you— %$* 13
—of authority. %$* 9
thank you. %$* 13
nell? %$* 13
well, the idea of the sec when it was created in the 1930s, was that it would be about putting information into the market and letting the market sort everything out, the sec, his authority is very limited, so they’re a keystone kop without a billy club. %$* 164
and, it’s a good idea to consider that, again, and it’s a good idea to “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) consider rewrapping some of that unwrapped regulation that we talked about, but right now washington doesn’t have the tools, and doesn’t have the authority necessary, i think, to provide that kind of oversight. %$* 164
and your opponent, nouriel roubini? %$* 13
well, you know, i go back again to the issue of incentives on international scales, financial crises do not occur everywhere, there are countries like canada and many others that have better regulators and supervised financial system, and these things don’t occur. %$* 163
it’s not that canadians are more moral or less greedy or less incompetent or more competent or more arrogant than anybody else and, same thing for europeans and asians and you name it. %$* 163
human nature is similar. %$* 163
and by the way they are not crooks, you know, everybody responded to incentives, everybody wanted to maximize profit returns and whatever, that’s what market economies are all about, but we know that human behavior can lead to excesses in society, that’s why we have institution in society, otherwise the law of the jungle. %$* 163
and in this case of financial market you know that greed and excesses can lead to damaging effects, that’s why prudential regulation, supervision of financial institution, is so much more important so at the end of the day, it’s good public policy, it makes a difference “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) between crisis occurring or not occurring, that’s the lesson of the last 50 years, it’s not about human nature, or greed or being criminal— %$* 163
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
this is for, against the motion, it seems like this is a, uh, chicken, which came first, chicken or the egg. %$* 9
do you mind if i tell the panel that actually both sides can address your question, we’ll be— %$* 13
sure, absolutely— %$* 9
the motion, but please, everyone consider this your final question— %$* 13
it may be so appropriately chicken versus the egg, chicken being washington, being afraid to do what’s right, and wall street who’s laid a ginormous egg. %$* 9
if it is a chicken- versus-egg scenario, and, as mr. %$* 9
gordon pointed out that we have a history of financial crises every 20 years for the most part, uh, wouldn’t it seem to be that wall street since our country was founded first and foremost by entrepreneurs and businessmen, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) uh, that set out to form their own government, that it would actually be driven more so by wall street than the government that they formed? %$* 9
alex berenson. %$* 13
i think, just to address that and to address the previous question ‘cause i think the previous question is a very good one, do you blame the cops or do you blame the robbers, if it—you know, the robbers are gonna steal isn’t it the cops’ job to stop them. %$* 160
i think you can take the keystone kops analogy too far. %$* 160
we want to have a banking system that makes loans. %$* 160
we want credit to be available to people, you know, the invention of the credit card, is actually one of the great inventions in american soc—you know, in the world in the 20th century, it really is, it’s the democratization of credit, where you didn’t have to go in and get down on one knee before a banker, to get a loan, was meaningful to people. %$* 160
being able to get a house and a mortgage is meaningful to people. %$* 160
so what we don’t want—so, you know, they’re robbers, but they’re not robbers, they’re people serving a useful societal function. %$* 160
and it’s up to %$* 160
so— so that makes— i know, i know, i can’t believe i just said that either. %$* 160
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i think niall ferguson is trying to get in here— %$* 13
but wait, let me just quickly fin— %$* 160
as your attorney i would advise you to stop speaking immediately— %$* 161
let me just quickly finish. %$* 160
quickly finish. %$* 160
that makes the job— %$* 160
—bad guys, i’m getting there. %$* 158
that— so, that means that the regulators, are not strictly out to arrest them or bust them, we have to set up a somewhat permissive regulatory system to allow them to operate, and then hope-slash-insist, that they actually don’t run the system into the ground, which, we didn’t do that— %$* 160
can we do chickens and eggs now, because i’m getting bored of cops and robbers. %$* 158
the— far be it from me to lecture an audience like this about american history but it seems to me that, the question wasn’t really framed quite correctly. %$* 158
from— %$* 158
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) i think you’re handling it okay, actually— %$* 13
that—thanks. %$* 158
the—from the very inception of the united states there was a profound tension, between washington and new york. %$* 158
alexander hamilton’s vision of the united states as a financial power was not shared by all the founding fathers and indeed james madison was extremely skeptical about it. %$* 158
that’s why there was consistent resistance to the creation of a central bank in the united states, that lasted right up until 1913 with the bank of the united states being chartered and then gotten rid of twice, in the course of the 19th century, so— i think we need to see this as part of a long argument, within american political culture. %$* 158
how powerful should new york be. %$* 158
and should those other parts of the united states, let’s call it main street, should they in fact dominate. %$* 158
and i think what’s happened in the last 10 years, is that new york did get the upper hand. %$* 158
and i think the rest of the country, is ready for a backlash. %$* 158
ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
so we are in the final stretch, in a very short time you the audience will decide who is the winner. %$* 13
recall that at the start of the debate we asked you whether you agreed or disagreed with the motion before us, “blame washington more than wall “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) street for the financial crisis,” before the debate, 42 percent of you were for the motion, 30 percent against, and 28 percent undecided, we will now have summarizing comments by each side of two minutes each. %$* 13
and i wanna ask you at the very end, i will make an announcement of the winner, and at that point i would ask for your forbearance, give us 30 seconds to end the npr broadcast, it oh so pleasant to have the sound of applause. %$* 13
and i will at a certain point raise my hand, i would ask you to applaud and then i’ll bring it down and everyone can go home. %$* 13
so just— it’ll be this. %$* 13
that’s clear? %$* 13
we’re not gonna do the rehearsal, it’s not kindergarten, you know— okay. %$* 13
round 3, summarizing comments from each side, first summarizing %$* 13
against the motion, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” alex berenson, investigative reporter for the new york times. %$* 13
i wanna thank niall, for sort of making our point with his very last remark where he said that new york became more powerful than the rest of the country i do think that to some extent all six of us forgot something when we were presented with this question that only came out in the debate in the discussion in the last 20 minutes, and that is, the internationalization of the— of the financial system. %$* 160
that when in 2000 the banks said to washington, if we don’t want these regulations on credit “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) derivatives, what they also said was, if you force this on us, we are going to go elsewhere. %$* 160
and, you know, it was only a few months ago that we were hearing that london was gonna be the primary financial center in the world, followed possibly by shanghai and hong kong within about five to 10 years, now, i think the city in london is getting even more badly hurt right now than new york. %$* 160
but the point is, actually that washington-versus-wall street is a false dichotomy because the banks became so powerful within the sphere of the financial world, that they essentially told washington, if you try to regulate us strictly, you are going to lose our business, jobs are gonna go overseas, and there will be no regulation at all. %$* 160
so you can have the sec, and the fed, and weak regulation, or you can have no regulation, those are the choices that you face. %$* 160
and they meant it. %$* 160
there were jobs shifted to london, a lot of jobs shifted to london, jobs shifted to hong kong. %$* 160
and i think that when you forget that, it becomes easier to blame washington, if you remember that, you will vote against this resolution, you will put the blame where it belongs, on wall street. %$* 160
thank you. %$* 160
summing up for the motion, “blame washington more than wall “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) street for the financial crisis,” john steele gordon, author of an empire of wealth. %$* 13
well, i just wanna say that while wall street certainly needs reform, it always needs reforms and it’s constantly being reformed, it has been for 200 years. %$* 161
but it doesn’t need reform as badly as washington, specifically congress. %$* 161
which is a profoundly sick institution. %$* 161
institutions tend to evolve in ways that benefit their elites, and if you want the poster child for that, it is the united states congress. %$* 161
i also wanna just add one thing on the %$* 161
people on the other side have been saying that wall street took all this—took their checkbooks down to washington and lobbied to get the regulation they wanted rather than stricter regulation. %$* 161
and actually said, therefore, congressmen were the victims of this. %$* 161
i’m sorry, but wall street was not debauching a virgin, it was paying a harlot. %$* 161
thank you very much. %$* 161
thank you, john steele gordon. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, jim chanos, founder of short- selling investment firm, kynikos associates. %$* 13
boy, how do i follow that one. %$* 162
well, again, we’ve had a lot of lofty philosophical questions batted back and forth, “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) but there have been very, very few facts put forth tonight. %$* 162
and i wanna stay with the facts. %$* 162
so we’ll just consider one instance, lehman brothers. %$* 162
which when it failed, had adequate regulatory capital, and was still profitable in its trailing 12 quarters. %$* 162
yet when the credit default swaps were settled for lehman brothers, a month later, its debts were marked down 90 cents on the dollar. %$* 162
now its debts at the time in terms of funded debt were $150 billion, stay with me on this, numbers are important when it comes to wall street. %$* 162
so, 90 cents off on that dollar bill means the debt was impaired by $135 billion. %$* 162
lehman bonds still trade around 10 to 15 cents on the dollar, six months later. %$* 162
there’s $20 billion in equity at the time, that tells us that the hole in lehman’s balance sheet was roughly $150 to $160 billion. %$* 162
to put that in perspective the hole in enron when the dust cleared, roughly was $60 to $70 billion. %$* 162
lehman was twice as bad as enron. %$* 162
we haven’t gotten to aig yet, or bear stearns, or god knows what else. %$* 162
ladies and gentlemen, malfeasance trumps incompetence for the purpose of this resolution, and i urge you to remember that when you vote. %$* 162
thank you, jim chanos, kynikos associates. %$* 13
nouriel roubini, professor of economics and international business at new york university’s stern school of business will summarize for the motion. %$* 13
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) well, you know, it’s not a debate about robbers and cops because there is a huge amount of evidence that actually, financial development is very beneficial for economic activity. %$* 163
companies are more financially developed, provide lots of services, you know. %$* 163
credit cards, mortgages, commercial real estates, insurance, risk hedging, you name it, it’s very important and beneficial but we know that when there is financial innovation sometimes becomes excessive, there is asset bubble, there are credit bubble, excessive restaking. %$* 163
people become greedy and all the rest, and you can have a system that is so regulated like some countries, like india, whenever there’s a bank that is ever failing, but you won’t actually, the market economy where sometimes, some banks fail. %$* 163
but you don’t want a system which everybody’s collapsing, you have systemic risk. %$* 163
and the distinction there is you want innovation, like in any country because it’s gonna be beneficial, but you want to avoid crisis, and to avoid crisis, you need appropriate rules, institution, prudential regulation of the financial system. %$* 163
not too much, not too little, it’s a trade-off, it’s not a black-and-white. %$* 163
and the difference between a system that works, that has innovation and provides benefits, and avoids a “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) crisis and one which crisis occur over and over again, has nothing to do with wall street or the greedy bank as you name it. %$* 163
has to do with the quality of public policy. %$* 163
proper supervision and regulation. %$* 163
that’s the distinction, has been always the case across countries, across history, so let’s look at the big picture. %$* 163
thank you, nouriel roubini. %$* 13
the motion is “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” and summarizing her position against the motion, nell minow, editor and co-founder of the corporate library. %$* 13
politicians are accountable through the political system, you don’t like ‘em, don’t vote for them. %$* 164
you wanna vote for candidates who don’t take money from lobbyists, be my guest, that was a policy that got barack obama in part elected. %$* 164
that’s great. %$* 164
but the people who stole money, to send it to washington, are the people on wall street. %$* 164
is there one shareholder of bear stearns or lehman, who wanted that money to be used to weaken regulation? %$* 164
no it wasn’t, there’s a huge moral hazard involved there. %$* 164
the same moral hazard that involved them paying themselves hundreds of millions of dollars. %$* 164
the return on investment for ceo pay is less than a piggy bank. %$* 164
and that’s because they’ve corrupted the system. %$* 164
they didn’t need any help from washington for that. %$* 164
they did it themselves. %$* 164
“blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) so please, vote against the resolution. %$* 164
thank you, nell minow, and finally, summarizing for the motion, niall ferguson, professor of history at harvard. %$* 13
well ladies and gentlemen, it’s not very often that you hear washington d.c.defended, by a journalist, a former government attorney, and a short seller. %$* 158
the journalist told us it would all have been absolutely fine if the banks had been as run as—had been run as well as the airlines, when did you last fly continental, alex? %$* 158
jim chanos told us that corporate fraud is endemic in corporate america, and this goes from enron to madoff. %$* 158
what they agree about, and here they do agree with us, is that, in many ways, washington is in hock to wall street. %$* 158
the difference is that nell minow thinks that washington, the legislators, poor things, are the victims, in this strange case. %$* 158
now, that is where we part company. %$* 158
on our side we see them anything as the victims, we see them as the key perpetrators. %$* 158
and let us not forget just how far this has gone. %$* 158
who was, nell, the second biggest recipient of donations from fannie and freddie? %$* 158
yes, it was the president of the united states, barack obama. %$* 158
and let’s not forget that among the firms that contributed most generously to his campaign were goldman “blame washington more than wall street” (3/17/09) sachs, citigroup, j.p.morgan, ubs, and morgan stanley. %$* 158
what we need to contemplate, ladies and gentlemen, is the latin americanization of the american political system. %$* 158
this symbiotic and indeed corrupt relationship between wall street and washington is the thing that is rotten at the heart of the united states, it is the principal explanation for this crisis, and that brings me to the key question you have to ask yourselves. %$* 158
who has to defend the public interest. %$* 158
is it the investment bankers, the hedge fund managers, or is it your elected representatives. %$* 158
ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly clear, that it is washington that has failed to defend the public interest, and i fear, it is continuing to fail to do so. %$* 158
please do vote for the motion. %$* 158
thank you, niall ferguson, and that concludes the argumentation portion of the evening, it is now time for the moment of truth, in which you the audience pick the winner. %$* 13
now you voted earlier when you came in, on the motion which is “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis.” we’re asking you to vote a second time. %$* 13

so i’d like to start our program now by welcoming to the stage our chairman, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 13
so, you know, as a rule, i'm looking back at this season, and we do a lot of debates that are sort of very, very up in the-- %$* 13
up in the ether. %$* 13
we've done the policies on drones, we've done international labor markets. %$* 13
and today we're kind of going in the opposite direction and digging down deep inside the human digestive system. %$* 13
and i kind of want to get a sense of what-- %$* 13
what's lighting up this debate for us? %$* 13
well, we did a debate a couple of years ago on the resolution, "organic food is marketing hype." and if you will recall, you and i were really surprised that it created so much emotional intensity among the panelists, more than any of the other 80 debates that we've done. %$* 1
and i at least came to realize that at least for the people-- %$* 1
many people on the pro side of this motion, this is not simply about a dietary choice. %$* 1
this is a kind of a-- %$* 1
almost a defining expression of who they are as people. %$* 1
it's-- %$* 1
it has an ethical content, an aesthetic content, a kind of political content. %$* 1
it's really about the identity of people who believe passionately in this. %$* 1
and that's why that debate was so successful, and that's why i think this is going to be a very interesting evening. %$* 1
have you seen what's happening on our website already? %$* 13
oh, my god. %$* 1
it is totally crazy. %$* 1
yeah, i mean, you can all still go and join afterwards, but there already is a very, very lively debate among civilians taking place on our website. %$* 13
but beyond a sort of a broad statement of values, are there really separate lines of attacks, sort of empirical attack that these debaters can make? %$* 13
yes. %$* 1
i mean, there definitely are. %$* 1
there are health issues, obviously, with-- %$* 1
both sides will have evidence to marshal on why their preferred diet is in fact better for health. %$* 1
there are environmental considerations. %$* 1
there are ethical considerations about the way animals are treated in this process. %$* 1
there's aesthetic considerations, even if you don't-- %$* 1
they don't quite rise to a level of ethics. %$* 1
i think the whole process of raising and slaughtering animals is one that i think most of us prefer not to think about very much, and we're going to be forced to think about it tonight. %$* 1
and what we have tonight are four debaters, bob, who have life stories that actually interact with this subject in real and vital ways. %$* 13
and i have to tell you, i saw them in the green room, and all four of them look very healthy. %$* 1
it was very annoying. %$* 13
let's welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
and thanks to bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for bringing this here-- %$* 13
the simple act of eating a hamburger is, when you really think about it, one of the great acts of human denial, because what is a burger? %$* 13
it's edible protein in the shape of a disk every single time. %$* 13
and you can order it rare, you can order it well done, you can dress it up in ketchup, you can put a little onion hat on top of it, you can push it around on your plate, you can leave half of it behind, and never once have the thought cross your mind, as you're chomping away, i wonder what she looked like, the cow this burger came from. %$* 13
i wonder where she lived. %$* 13
i wonder how she died. %$* 13
our thoughts just don't go there, which is fine if you believe that meat-eating is just nature's way, and that meat in the diet makes a lot of sense. %$* 13
but what if you take the vegan or the vegetarian's view that eating meat is just wrong for your health, for your environment, for your soul. %$* 13
well, that sounds like the dividing line in a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: “don’t eat anything with a face.” a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are here at the kaufman music center in new york. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: “don’t eat anything with a face.” as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is, “don't eat anything with a face.” and let's meet the team arguing for that motion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome dr. %$* 13
neal barnard. %$* 13
and, neal, you are president and founder of the physicians committee for responsible medicine. %$* 13
you’re a clinical researcher. %$* 13
you study the effects of diet on health. %$* 13
you do not eat meat now, but you come from a family of cattle ranchers in fargo, north dakota. %$* 13
so i'm wondering, do you ever get the craving? %$* 13
you know, i have to tell you, it's like quitting smoking. %$* 223
any moments of doubt you have as you're getting away from meat are quickly replaced by being very, very glad that you've broken a bad habit. %$* 223
you are free now. %$* 13
free now and glad of it. %$* 223
and your partner is? %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
the president of farm sanctuary. %$* 223
gene baur. %$* 13
gene, you are also arguing for our motion, “don't eat anything with a face.” you are president of the farm sanctuary, as your partner just mentioned. %$* 13
that is an animal rescue and refuge organization that you cofounded in 1986.you have been a vegan for decades. %$* 13
and when we first got in touch with you, you were up in lake placid, doing, at the age of 50, an ironman triathlon, which you said you were doing largely to prove that a plant-based diet could get you through 140 miles in the race. %$* 13
you did it under 12 hours. %$* 13
congratulations. %$* 13
and i just want to ask you, if you had had to narrow down your plant-based diet to just one vegetable to get you through that race, what would it have been? %$* 13
got to go with the leafy greens. %$* 224
kale is what it's about. %$* 224
kale. %$* 13
we will be handing out kale in the lobby after the debate. %$* 13
our motion is, “don't eat anything with a face.” we have two debaters who are arguing against it. %$* 13
first, please, let's welcome chris masterjohn. %$* 13
chris, you are a nutritional sciences researcher at the university of illinois at urbana- champaign. %$* 13
you write two popular blogs, the daily lipid and mother nature obeyed. %$* 13
and that's hosted by the weston a.price foundation. %$* 13
and when we spoke to you a few months ago, you were taking salsa lessons, dance lessons. %$* 13
you are a competitive dancer. %$* 13
and we learned that your partner is a vegan, whereas you are a guy who not only eats meat, but you also like to eat the bones, the skin, and the organs. %$* 13
so how does that dance partnership work out? %$* 13
well, ballroom dancing, like any other partner dancing, is a form of communication, and no communication can be successful without mutual respect, so, that's how it works. %$* 225
so you work it out. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, chris masterjohn. %$* 13
and, chris, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the nation's leading ethical, ecologically conscious, and health conscious farmer. %$* 225
his-- %$* 225
everything he wants to do is illegal. %$* 225
he is joel salatin. %$* 225
ladies and gentlemen, joel salatin. %$* 13
joel, you are also arguing against this motion, “don’t eat anything with a face.” you are a third-generation alternative farmer. %$* 13
your farm polyface, incorporated serves more than five thousand families, ten retail outlets, fifty restaurants. %$* 13
you are a celebrity in this story ever since being featured in michael pollan's book the omnivore's dilemma and then later in the documentary food, inc. %$* 13
so we know how you treat the cows and the chickens. %$* 13
the question is, how do the cows and chickens treat you? %$* 13
well, they treat me like a servant. %$* 226
they wait for me to move them. %$* 226
they wait for me to feed them and water them and take care of them. %$* 226
and i love serving them. %$* 226
in fact, all my life i have served them first before i eat breakfast. %$* 226
they have a good deal. %$* 13
they have a good deal. %$* 226
and-- %$* 226
and it's a distinct pleasure and privilege to be able to serve them and make them happy every day. %$* 226
thank you, joel salatin. %$* 13
and those are our four debaters, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
so this is a debate. %$* 13
our motion is, “don’t eat anything with a face.” we have two team-- %$* 13
two teams, one arguing for and against. %$* 13
only one team will win. %$* 13
and you, our live audience, will be our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once after the arguments are made. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the first vote. %$* 13
you go to those key pads at your seat. %$* 13
again, looking at the motion, “don’t eat anything with a face.” if that statement resonates with you, if you embrace that, you believe it, you champion it, push number one. %$* 13
if you take the opposite view, if “don’t eat anything with a face" sounds ridiculous to you, nonsense, you push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, which is a perfectly reasonable opening position, you push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and we will lock out in about ten seconds. %$* 13
if you made a mistake, just correct yourself. %$* 13
we'll register your last vote. %$* 13
and remember how you voted because right after the debates-- %$* 13
the arguments are made-- %$* 13
we will have you vote a second time. %$* 13
and, once more, it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms from their starting position who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round one. %$* 13
round one are opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this, “don’t eat anything with a face.” and here to speak first in support of this motion, dr. %$* 13
neal barnard. %$* 13
he is an adjunct associate professor of medicine at george washington university school of medicine. %$* 13
neal, you can make your way to your lectern. %$* 13
he is also president and founder of the physicians committee for responsible medicine. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dr. %$* 13
neal barnard. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 223
gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues. %$* 223
i'm going to talk about health. %$* 223
in 2009, the archives of internal medicine published a massive research study. %$* 223
the nih-aarp study had a half a million participants. %$* 223
they were followed for 10 years. %$* 223
some of them didn't eat meat or didn't eat very much. %$* 223
some ate quite a lot of meat. %$* 223
and what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women. %$* 223
and in 2012, the archives of internal medicine published another study. %$* 223
one hundred and twenty thousand people. %$* 223
this was coordinated all at harvard university. %$* 223
and it showed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher. %$* 223
and studies have clearly shown that people who don't eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent. %$* 223
well, why would meat be linked to cancer? %$* 223
hold that thought for a second. %$* 223
i grew up in fargo, north dakota, and i come from a long line of cattle ranchers. %$* 223
my dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as i can trace. %$* 223
now, my dad did not like the cattle business. %$* 223
he objected to it a great deal. %$* 223
he went to medical school. %$* 223
he spent his life treating diabetes in fargo, north dakota. %$* 223
but we still ate like we were in the cattle business. %$* 223
every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas. %$* 223
and my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented, and he died. %$* 223
and we took that as normal because he was old. %$* 223
he was 65.my other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died. %$* 223
and none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this. %$* 223
now, i got my first wake-up call at fairview hospital in minneapolis, where i was the autopsy assistant. %$* 223
one day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story. %$* 223
and the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that i was headed for medical school. %$* 223
so he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, "look inside."and it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when i felt it, it was hard like a rock. %$* 223
and he said, "that's atherosclerosis. %$* 223
that's your morning sausage, neal. %$* 223
that's your bacon, neal. %$* 223
that's your roast beef in there." and he said, "we see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23," which happened to be the age i was at the time. %$* 223
and he wrote up all his findings. %$* 223
he left the room. %$* 223
and i had to clean up. %$* 223
i took the ribs. %$* 223
i put them back in the chest. %$* 223
i tried to make them fit with the other ribs. %$* 223
and i sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and i went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch. %$* 223
now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little-- %$* 223
a few years later dr. %$* 223
dean ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before. %$* 223
the arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications. %$* 223
grass-fed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised. %$* 223
it just doesn't work. %$* 223
eating chicken and eating fish just can't do that. %$* 223
and so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and nih funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes. %$* 223
and it works better than any other diet. %$* 223
why? %$* 223
because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories. %$* 223
that's its job. %$* 223
you get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories. %$* 223
meat has zero fiber, none. %$* 223
fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have don’t have it, you’re going to eat too much, and you’re going to gain weight. %$* 223
why diabetes? %$* 223
because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own. %$* 223
and we saw something i never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving, sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes. %$* 223
and when we look at broad population studies, the meat-eaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest. %$* 223
diabetes is the same way. %$* 223
it’s about 8 percent of adult meat-eaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent. %$* 223
high blood pressure, exactly the same. %$* 223
you just don’t see it very much in people following vegetarian diets. %$* 223
but why more cancer? %$* 223
well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesn’t happen with plant foods, and that’s that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is. %$* 223
but that’s not the only carcinogen. %$* 223
we also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, there’s heme iron, there are a lot of things. %$* 223
plus meat doesn’t have fiber that protects you. %$* 223
it doesn’t have any vitamin c. it’s low in important antioxidants. %$* 223
so it’s like tobacco. %$* 223
we know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but we’re not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible. %$* 223
we know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body. %$* 223
the stomach, the intestinal tract-- %$* 223
but we’re not sure. %$* 223
is it the hcas? %$* 223
the pahs? %$* 223
we’re not quite sure yet. %$* 223
i asked dr. %$* 223
richard leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat- eating? %$* 223
and he said humans are naturally primates. %$* 223
we’re great apes. %$* 223
we are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the stone age gave us stone tools, and meat-eating began, he believes, as scavenging. %$* 223
lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had. %$* 223
problem: we have pre-stone age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat. %$* 223
of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesn’t matter, but if you live to a mid-age and beyond, then these things matter a lot. %$* 223
and what matters now is alzheimer’s disease. %$* 223
we have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat-- %$* 223
that’s the bad fat in meat-- %$* 223
is linked to alzheimer’s disease in studies in chicago, in new york, in finland. %$* 223
and meat-eaters actually have very poor nutrition. %$* 223
yes, they get protein, but they don’t get many vitamins, they don’t get any complex carbohydrates, they’re missing fiber. %$* 223
a vegetarian diet gives you all the protein you’re going to need, plus many more vitamins, many more minerals. %$* 223
so bill clinton did. %$* 223
al gore did it. %$* 223
bob barker did it. %$* 223
serena williams did it. %$* 223
since 2004 meat-eating has dropped by 9 percent. %$* 223
that’s where we’re going. %$* 223
that’s the future. %$* 223
thank you very much. %$* 223
thank you neal barnard. %$* 13
our motion is: “don’t eat anything with a face.” and now our first debater to speak against the motion: chris masterjohn is a researcher at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, where he studies interactions between fat- soluble vitamins a, d, and k. ladies and gentlemen, chris masterjohn. %$* 13
first, thank you to everyone involved tonight for providing us with an opportunity to debate this issue in such an excellent forum. %$* 225
and john, every time that i buy meat, i always think about the conditions the cow was raised in. %$* 225
tonight my partner joel salatin and i will urge you to vote against the motion, "don’t eat anything with a face." i’d like to begin by telling you a personal story. %$* 225
when i was 18, i became a vegetarian, because i believed that this would be the most healthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice i could make. %$* 225
six months later i became a vegan, meaning i excluded all animal products from my diet. %$* 225
after all, i had to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic. %$* 225
all animals die regardless of whether we kill them, and what i opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seen in the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than it is for animals raised for meat. %$* 225
i’m sure that my opponent, gene, will explain some of this abuse to you later tonight. %$* 225
a year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journey through vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land of vibrant health. %$* 225
many pre-existing health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance to me in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my day-to-day function. %$* 225
my digestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed. %$* 225
intense exercise began giving my anxiety and heart palpitations. %$* 225
in a single dental examination, i found out that i had over a dozen cavities and needed two root canals. %$* 225
worst of all, my anxiety disorders aggravated to the point that i had several panic attacks per week and was often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car. %$* 225
but then i encountered the work of weston price, which really changed my life. %$* 225
weston price was the first research director for what became the american dental association and was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. %$* 225
he documented-- %$* 225
all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes and latitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds-- %$* 225
the consistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he called the “displacing foods of modern commerce”: white flower, white sugar, white rice, vegetable oils, and canned goods. %$* 225
in every case, the transition was one from radiant and vibrant health to not only tooth decay and dental deformities, but often to tuberculosis, cancer, ulcers, appendicitis, cystitis, gallbladder disease, physical degeneration of all kinds. %$* 225
all of the groups that successfully maintained vibrant health on their traditional diets placed special emphasis on the need for animal products rich in fat-soluble vitamins. %$* 225
some groups emphasized dairy products, others emphasized organ meats and egg yolks, others the animal life of the sea, and yet others small animals and insects. %$* 225
price went on to provide laboratory and clinical evidence that the emphasis on these foods was in fact a critical reason for the success of these traditional diets. %$* 225
after reading price's work, i began emphasizing high-quality, nutrient-dense animal foods in my own diet, and within months my anxiety disorders completely disappeared, and my tooth decay came to a crashing halt. %$* 225
i truly felt like a new person. %$* 225
indeed, my mental and physical health had undergone a revolution. %$* 225
my experience raises two questions: first, am i alone in it? %$* 225
and second, what happened to me and why? %$* 225
the scientific literature shows that i'm not alone. %$* 225
seven out of eight relevant studies found that compared to omnivores, vegetarians have a greater risk of mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, poor self-esteem, anxiety, and contemplated or attempted suicide. %$* 225
a study published in 2010 found that compared to omnivores, vegans had eight times more lesions involving poor mineralization of the teeth. %$* 225
why might this be? %$* 225
well, simply put, many nutrients are much easier to get from animal products than from plant products. %$* 225
perhaps the most underappreciated of these is cholesterol. %$* 225
many people are aware that high cholesterol is associated with heart disease. %$* 225
but few people are aware that low cholesterol is associated with mental disorders, violent and self-injurious behavior, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and increased total mortality. %$* 225
dr. %$* 225
barnard himself has published scientific papers showing that, although his diet leads to increased intakes of many nutrients, primarily from fruits and vegetables, it also leads to decreased intakes of vitamin b12, vitamin d, and selenium, and fails to guarantee an adequate intake of zinc. %$* 225
dr. %$* 225
barnard recommends supplementing with vitamin b12 and vitamin d and emphasizing vegan foods rich in zinc, but the foods richest in zinc aren't vegan at all. %$* 225
they're oysters, beef, and cheese. %$* 225
it is unlikely that supplementing our way out of these nutrient deficiencies, moreover, will be a complete success, because all of these nutrients have very complex interactions with the other components present in the foods in which we find them. %$* 225
vitamin b12, for example, synergizes with key amino acids found most abundantly in meat, bones, and skin. %$* 225
is it possible to design an adequate diet that does not include the meat of animals with faces? %$* 225
i actually think that it is. %$* 225
it would include egg yolks, dairy products and shellfish. %$* 225
shellfish are neither vegan nor vegetarian, after all; they're animals. %$* 225
but many people might argue, perhaps correctly, that they don't have faces. %$* 225
such a diet, however, would not be adequate for everyone. %$* 225
let me provide, by way of example for now, just one reason why: vitamin a.vitamin a is found most abundantly in liver and cod liver oil or the liver oils of other fishes, while more moderate amounts are found in egg yolks and butter fat. %$* 225
red, orange, yellow and green vegetables provide carotenoids such as beta- carotene which we can convert into vitamin a.however, the efficiency of this conversion is relatively poor and highly variable. %$* 225
half of people with european ancestry have a genetic variant that cuts their ability to make the conversion in half, and a third, other variant that cuts it fourfold. %$* 225
these people are extremely unlikely to get enough vitamin a from plant foods alone and would do best if they included liver or cod liver oil in their diet which are derived from animals with faces. %$* 225
in order to construct an optimal dietary approach that is robust to error and adaptable to individual needs, we need to abandon the false dichotomy between healthy plant foods and supposedly unhealthy animal foods, and instead embrace the health value of high-quality, nutrient-dense foods of all types. %$* 225
fortunately, animal foods are highest in quality and richest in nutrients when the animals are raised in an ethical and ecologically conscious manner, with high-quality soil, out on pasture in the fresh air and sunshine. %$* 225
my partner joel salatin will explain more about how this is done and will conclude our opening argument for why you should vote against this motion. %$* 225
thank you, chris masterjohn. %$* 13
and here's where we are: we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: "don’t eat anything with a face." you have heard the first two opening statements, and now onto the third, to debate for the motion, “don’t eat anything with a face.”we're going to bring to the lectern gene baur. %$* 13
he is president and co- founder of the farm sanctuary, the nation's largest farm animal rescue and protection organization. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, gene baur. %$* 13
thank you very much, and thank you for this opportunity. %$* 224
it's wonderful to be discussing this issue. %$* 224
most people don't think enough about our food choices and about the animals who suffer terribly for the meat, milk and eggs that is produced in this country. %$* 224
i grew up eating animals without really thinking about it. %$* 224
my parents ate animals, my brothers and sisters ate animals. %$* 224
everybody around me was doing it, so i just adopted the habit, without really thinking about it. %$* 224
but as i started learning about the fact of how these animals were treated and about the fact that i could live well without eating animals, i made the choice to become a vegan. %$* 224
i did that back in 1985. %$* 224
it's one of the best choices i've ever made. %$* 224
and the fact that we can live well without eating other animals, without causing harm, i think is the key question here, the key point. %$* 224
if we can live well without causing harm, why wouldn't we do it? %$* 224
and the main reason is that we just sort of grow up doing it, without thinking about it. %$* 224
so, the question is, how can we live well? %$* 224
how do we want to feel when we treat other animals the way we treat them? %$* 224
and on these factory farms, they're treated horribly. %$* 224
i visited farms across the country. %$* 224
i've seen animals put in these small cages where they can't move. %$* 224
you walk into these farms, and you're hit with this horrible stench. %$* 224
they're living in their feces. %$* 224
they're screaming to get out of their cages, and they live that way their whole lives, and then they're killed young so that we can eat them. %$* 224
and, you know, when people see this, they don't like it. %$* 224
and oftentimes people say, "don't tell me. %$* 224
i don't want to know," when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy. %$* 224
when we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people, and we see them suffer, we feel something. %$* 224
that is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else's face. %$* 224
when the executioners at the salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, “don't look into their face, because if you do, they'll cast a spell on you, and you won't be able to kill them.” basically, when you look into their face, there's empathy, there's a connection, there's an understanding that there's a living creature there. %$* 224
and when you abuse another animal or another person for that matter, there's this tendency to try to denigrate them and to say, well, they don't really have feelings. %$* 224
they don't really deserve any better. %$* 224
and that's unfortunately what has happened to farm animals. %$* 224
there are these misconceptions and incorrect ideas about animals on farms not being smart. %$* 224
for instance, people think turkeys are so dumb they'll go outside and they'll drown in the rain. %$* 224
this is one of these myths that people say, probably to feel better about mistreating animals. %$* 224
but we've raised turkeys at farm sanctuary for many years. %$* 224
they go outside. %$* 224
they've never gone out and drowned in the rain. %$* 224
they enjoy, you know, going indoors and outdoors. %$* 224
and when the animals come to us, they're often afraid because they've only known cruelty. %$* 224
but when they start recognizing they're in a safe place, and they start being treated with kindness, they respond. %$* 224
and it's a beautiful thing to see. %$* 224
we had a turkey at our farm in california we used to call lydia the hugging turkey, because you'd go out into the barnyard and kneel down, and she would come up to you, and she would crane her neck around your neck like she was giving you a hug. %$* 224
so these animal show companionship and friendship. %$* 224
and i'm not the only one that has seen this. %$* 224
people who visit farm sanctuary and work there have seen this. %$* 224
jane goodall, also, is now speaking out about the fact that these animals have feelings and much more intellectual and emotional depth than we ever knew before. %$* 224
she said, "farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. %$* 224
they are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined. %$* 224
they are individuals in their own right." now, on factory farms, these animals are treated horribly. %$* 224
i think there is widespread support among this panel even among those who think that it's okay to eat animals, that factory farming is an abomination, that it should not occur. %$* 224
it is outside the bounds of acceptable conduct. %$* 224
the real challenge is discussing, what about animals who are not treated so badly? %$* 224
should we eat them? %$* 224
and i would suggest, no, we should not. %$* 224
we do not need to. %$* 224
we do not need to cause them harm. %$* 224
and whenever animals are seen as consumable products, there is a tendency to treat them not very well. %$* 224
i've been to factory farms, i have been to small farms, and even on these farms that are purported to be humane, there are significant problems. %$* 224
whenever the animals are seen as consumables, the relationship is one of exploitation, and that is a huge problem that we need to face, and something we don't need to do. %$* 224
in addition, animal production is very wasteful. %$* 224
the united nations came out with a report a couple years ago talking about how animal agriculture is one of the top contributors to the most serious environmental problems we're facing on the planet, including climate change. %$* 224
and these animals are routinely fed antibiotics as well, so we have these antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are now developing on these farms. %$* 224
and so these are other problems associated with this attitude of looking at animals just as commodities. %$* 224
so, eating animals is bad for the animals. %$* 224
it is bad for the environment. %$* 224
it is bad for us. %$* 224
it is not necessary. %$* 224
we can live and be healthy on eating plants alone. %$* 224
i urge you to vote yes on the motion that we should not eat anything with a face. %$* 224
so thank you very much. %$* 224
thank you, gene baur. %$* 13
and that's our motion: “don’t eat anything with a face.”and here to argue against this motion, we want to bring to the lectern joel salatin. %$* 13
he is a full-time farmer in virginia's shenandoah valley and the author of eight books. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome joel salatin. %$* 13
we're going to have an interesting evening since potatoes have eyes. %$* 226
corn has ears. %$* 226
cabbages have heads. %$* 226
and, goodness, what are we going to do about those navel oranges? %$* 226
eating things with faces is great, so i'm happy with our negative position. %$* 226
chris and i have some overarching positions. %$* 226
number one: affirmative studies, affirmative studies impugning animal farming or omnivorous nutrition must be based on pasture-based data, not chemical, pharmaceutical, concentrated animal feeding operations, like cafos. %$* 226
on our farm, the nutrient difference in folate-- %$* 226
just pick one nutrient-- %$* 226
between a usda-blessed-- %$* 226
we call it the "u.s. duh"-- %$* 226
the usda-blessed egg at 47 micrograms and a polyface-pastured egg at 1,200 micrograms are incomparable. %$* 226
chris and i categorically reject any and all cafos, chemical fertilization, aquifer irrigation, and genetic modification, as being necessary or meritorious in food production. %$* 226
factory food has no merit in this debate, and none of the studies will hold water if they use factory food, and you'll find that they all do. %$* 226
number two: plants are sentient beings. %$* 226
they attack, communicate, respond, and build communities. %$* 226
their language is chemical. %$* 226
plants have faces, even though we might not recognize them. %$* 226
the affirmative promotes a segregated view toward life. %$* 226
chris and i promote an integrated view. %$* 226
number three: the motion before you does not allow for climate, cultural, economic, or hunger contingencies. %$* 226
an essential thing: the affirmative has not asked for any contingencies. %$* 226
if the affirmative wanted some contingencies, they should have worded the resolution or not agreed to their position. %$* 226
chris and i will hold them to the motion's clarity. %$* 226
number four: domestic livestock are owned by 60 percent of the world's poor, primarily because they represent portable wealth to the unlanded poor and nutrition density protected from spoilage and vermin. %$* 226
the affirmative position is a direct attack on the world's poor. %$* 226
number five: not a single affirmative study assumes modern, pasture-based models, using high-tech electric fencing, portable shade cloth shelters, permaculture, hydration techniques, or cottage-based, localized processing infrastructure. %$* 226
this oversight dooms every affirmative conclusion to obsolescence. %$* 226
number six: life requires death. %$* 226
the fact that all of us can come to this luxurious room, comfortable and well-fed, and entertain ourselves by debating whether we should viscerally and actively participate in our role on an ecological continuum is bizarre. %$* 226
native americans ate 10 pounds of buffalo a day, when they could get it. %$* 226
and plenty of starving children in the world would be grateful for a morsel of anything, whether it wiggles or not. %$* 226
number seven: everything is eaten and being-- %$* 226
is eating and being eaten. %$* 226
if you don't believe that, go lie naked in your flowerbed for three days, and see what gets eaten. %$* 226
number eight: humans are the ultimate caretaker species, and the notion that my dog is my uncle is my cat is my child does not indicate an evolutionary newfound state of heightened spiritual cosmic awareness, but rather a profound devolution into ignorance and disconnection to our ecological umbilical. %$* 226
number nine: killing and eating are interchangeable. %$* 226
if it is wrong to eat, then it is wrong to kill. %$* 226
killing without eating is an insult to life and resource. %$* 226
number ten: environmental integrity demands certain patterns whether we like them or not. %$* 226
chris and i believe these patterns supersede mickey mouse, bambi, and templeton, the rat. %$* 226
when my parents purchased 550 acres in virginia’s shenandoah valley in 1961, it was a cheap and great. %$* 226
gullies, many measuring maybe 12 feet deep, incised the fields-- %$* 226
deep scars, testifying to the death from grain production. %$* 226
organic matter averaged one percent. %$* 226
large areas that had lost three to five feet of top soil were barren rock. %$* 226
at the time, the farm would only support 20 cows. %$* 226
now, a mere 52 years later, organic matter averages 8 percent, the gullies are healing, the barren rock faces are covered with a foot of new top soil, and the farm supports 150 cows. %$* 226
out of ashes came a phoenix. %$* 226
how? %$* 226
by mimicking the foundational principle of ecological health. %$* 226
animals (primarily herbivores), perennials, and predation. %$* 226
in case you missed this in biology class, here’s how it works: sunlight converts to biomass through photosynthesis. %$* 226
the biomass grows slowly at first, then rapidly, then goes into senescence. %$* 226
the herbivore prunes the senescence biomass back to restart the rapid growth cycle. %$* 226
predation-- %$* 226
both carnivorous and otherwise, like weather or fire-- %$* 226
creates movement patterns, even intensifying herbivores into mobs. %$* 226
all fertile soils have been built with perennials, herbivores, and predators, not tillage and annuals, like wheat and corn. %$* 226
by practicing this mob stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization, our farm is growing soil, growing organic matter, healing the water cycle, and pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. %$* 226
every single nook and cranny on the planet is full of animals. %$* 226
why? %$* 226
because they convert biomass into soil. %$* 226
from kitchen scraps fed to the homestead chickens to caribou converting lichens to manure, animals create ecological integrity. %$* 226
humans can’t eat most biomass. %$* 226
the few types we can, like vegetables, require extremely fertile soil. %$* 226
not one single organic vegetable or produce regimen exists that doesn’t rely on animal or fish manures for fertility. %$* 226
the principle of life requiring death or sacrifice is a most profound spiritual and ecological truth. %$* 226
how we treat the plant and animal in life impart sacredness to the sacrifice. %$* 226
the reason herbivores and seafood form the basis of all diets in antiquity is because these were the only nutrient-rich options that didn’t require tillage and storage. %$* 226
until mechanization and cheap energy, tillage was extremely laborious. %$* 226
another critical ecological function for animals was that they were the only way nature had of moving around fertility. %$* 226
gravity pulls biomass downhill. %$* 226
the only way to defy gravity and pull it back uphill is to either walk it up or fly it up. %$* 226
what makes it do that? %$* 226
predation. %$* 226
the most efficacious way to remediate environmental degradation while producing the nutrition required by our human population is to embrace animal husbandry in a biomimicry paradigm: perennial, animal, predator. %$* 226
alan savory’s eloquent ted talk explains proper animal management is the best hope for stopping climate change and desertification. %$* 226
so vote for ecological integrity and nutritional superiority that we should eat both plants and animals. %$* 226
in case you forgot, it’s the negative position in this debate. %$* 226
thank you, joel salatin. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is, "don’t eat anything with a face." and now we move on to round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
this is our motion: "don’t eat anything with a face." we have heard from each of our teams in opening statements. %$* 13
we heard from neal barnard and gene bauer, who are arguing in support of the motion, "don’t eat anything with a face." we heard them make the argument that meat raises the risk of getting sick; that it is simply wrong to kill animals for food, to deny their feelings, and to-- %$* 13
they argue for a respect for animals as a fellow life form. %$* 13
they basically argue, bottom line, that we can live well without causing harm to animals, and killing them for food is indeed causing them harm. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, chris masterjohn and joel salatin, they’re saying it’s basically-- %$* 13
it’s about the nutrition, folks. %$* 13
and they’re saying there is nothing as nutritious as meat, that it delivers nutrients in far greater density than any other form of food, and they also make the interesting argument that even to be discussing a world of veganism is really a privilege of modernity – that in fact in parts of the world that are not as privileged as the united states, an animal is an investment, an animal represents wealth, and an animal represents food that can be kept alive and fresh until the time that it has to be eaten, and that's the way it always was until very recently. %$* 13
now, we've seen several strains of argument here: practical, health, and ethical. %$* 13
and i'd like to explore all of them. %$* 13
i want to stipulate that it's clear that these debaters do agree about one thing. %$* 13
no one on this stage is in favor or arguing to justify factory farming. %$* 13
what they are disagreeing about is whether it is right to kill an animal for food or not. %$* 13
so we want to be focusing on that aspect of this. %$* 13
and on that, there is a strong disagreement among them. %$* 13
what i want to do is take to the side that's arguing for the motion, "don’t eat anything with a face," who opened with the health argument, that food-- %$* 13
that meat-- %$* 13
makes you sick, that this is well-documented. %$* 13
and we heard personal testimonial of neal barnard as a young medical student, seeing that for himself, firsthand, with patients that he was treating, and bring to you, neal, your opponent chris masterjohn's testimony to the opposite. %$* 13
he went on a vegan diet, got really, really sick from it. %$* 13
his teeth started falling apart. %$* 13
he felt terrible, and he went back to meat because his argument is that's where the nutrients are. %$* 13
neal barnard. %$* 13
well, i don't want to speak for chris. %$* 223
but having read the documents that he circulated in advance, he had the psychiatric issues before he went vegetarian, while he was vegetarian, and after. %$* 223
and if i read them correctly, he said that eating cholesterol was not sufficient, that he also needed religion in order to fight his way back. %$* 223
and i say this not to mock it, but to say that these problems were pre-existing before the diet change. %$* 223
and the studies that he cited were observational studies. %$* 223
we have put this to the test. %$* 223
we worked with the insurance company geico in ten different cities. %$* 223
and we introduced plant-based diets for about 300 people, and we measured levels of depression, levels of anxiety. %$* 223
they got better. %$* 223
and we have now about three randomized trials along these lines. %$* 223
people get better. %$* 223

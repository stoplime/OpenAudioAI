avorn and the fda is unwilling to approve drugs for narrow circumstances because they don't trust that physicians are just going to use that drug based on where the data indicates that it's going to have its most beneficial impact. %$* 295
that's a very difficult problem to try to solve from a central agency in washington. %$* 295
and that is at the root of a lot of these issues that we're talking about here. %$* 295
i think we should put it on the table. %$* 295
but wait, i have to-- %$* 101
i simply have to-- %$* 101
your description that the targeted drugs are a rarity is just disconnected from reality. %$* 101
all of the hiv drugs were structure-based design. %$* 101
most all of the are targeted drugs, all monoclonal antibodies are precisely targeted drugs. %$* 101
you know, most of our cancer therapies are on this. %$* 101
they can now go from a genetic identification to a mab or a structure-based drug in four years, licensed, okay? %$* 101
they're doing it here in new york. %$* 101
they just got xalkori out in four years, gene to active drug, targeted. %$* 101
this is not a rarity. %$* 101
and this is where all of medicine is headed. %$* 101
this is not a problem. %$* 296
if a company knows that a drug is going to work for a patient with a particular genetic makeup, and they say, let us do a study only in people with that genetic makeup, herceptin is an example of that in relation to breast cancer. %$* 296
they can bring that to the fda and say, “this is the people we want to test it in. %$* 296
it's a subgroup.” the fda will say, fine. %$* 296
test it in those people. %$* 296
if it works in them, the drug gets approved. %$* 296
the idea that there are these-- %$* 296
if only that were true. %$* 101
the subgroups that are out there that are not well defined, and nobody knows quite who they are, but maybe it'll benefit somebody, so let's let anyone have access to it doesn't make sense because it does open the door. %$* 296
some of my best friends are doctors. %$* 296
but it does open the door to the idea that any doctor and any patient can take any chemical that they think might be helpful and say, let's start using it. %$* 296
and that is the pre-thalidomide, pre-1906 era that i don't think we want to go back to. %$* 296
okay. %$* 13
i want to put now to this side the subtext of what was-- %$* 13
your opponents have been arguing all along, is that there have been numbers of cases where an agency which, as they have indicated, may be overly influenced by the industry that they're supposed to regulate, has approved products that have caused exceedingly harmful in very public ways. %$* 13
vioxx, for example. %$* 13
the iud shield. %$* 13
so they're making the case that if you don't watch very tightly-- %$* 13
if you don't test very, very rigorously, people are going to get killed. %$* 13
can you take that side? %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 295
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
read dr. %$* 295
avorn's book. %$* 295
and again, if i misquote you, let me know. %$* 295
i don't think that you trust drug companies in that book. %$* 295
you express a mistrust of drug companies. %$* 295
i know you don't trust physicians to make nuanced prescribing decisions based on the label information. %$* 295
i don't think you think that patients can make fully informed decisions, because the information is too hard to interpret. %$* 295
you don't trust fda, but you want to give them more authority. %$* 295
so my question is, who do you trust? %$* 295
jerry avorn. %$* 13
i trust my wife, who'd-- %$* 296
but if-- %$* 296
you know, scott, when you put it like that, it does sound like i'm some sort of a paranoid geek who really had fears of everything. %$* 296
i think if we're going to have a regulatory agency-- %$* 296
you know, i don't trust airline pilots if they haven't been certified as being able to fly a plane. %$* 296
i think there're a lot of things in society where we do not accept that whatever a person wants to do is okay because they must have good intentions, it'll probably come out okay. %$* 296
health care doesn't work like that. %$* 296
we need to assume that if something is effective, it needs to be demonstrated by the people who want to sell-- %$* 296
and we're not arguing for no fda. we're-- %$* 295
what the question is-- %$* 295
what should the level of evidence be? %$* 295
when should judgment take over when it comes to a disease, where there isn't available therapy? %$* 295
yondelis is a-- %$* 295
i don't want to be an advertiser for the drug company-- %$* 295
a lot of people think it's a very good drug for sarcoma, where there's no available for therapy. %$* 295
what's the harm in making it available here? %$* 295
watching it closely, allowing doctors who treat that disease-- %$* 295
it's just a small community of physicians who treat that disease-- %$* 295
to use it. %$* 295
i agree with you that there should be vigilant post-market follow-up; fda has tools to do that. %$* 295
they can be holding the drug companies accountable, and should be. %$* 295
but what's the harm in making it available? %$* 295
trusting physicians to use it appropriately? %$* 295
some won't, many will. %$* 295
trusting patients to make informed judgments. %$* 295
some won't, many will. %$* 295
all right. %$* 13
i want to go to audience questions now. %$* 13
and the way that this will work is if you raise your hand, a microphone will be brought down the aisle once i call on you. %$* 13
i'll need you to stand up, state your name, hold the microphone about a fifths distance from your mouth so that we can hear you on all of the various broadcasts. %$* 13
remember to keep it on topic to keep these guys debating on this motion. %$* 13
before we get to that, i just want to do a little bit of celebrity spotting. %$* 13
three tonight so far. %$* 13
i want to welcome john stossel of fox news. %$* 13
frequent-- %$* 13
a few times a debater on this stage. %$* 13
and it's a pleasure to have you here. %$* 13
pete dominick, who has a radio show on sirius xm-- %$* 13
xm sirius, and also on cnn, and is a big fan and supporter of intelligence squared, down in the front row. %$* 13
but the real prize, since we've been talking about genetics and the world that has been open to us, we have in the audience-- %$* 13
if you remember, from reading “the double helix” watson and crick, in 1953, in the united kingdom and here, discovering the structure of dna.jim watson is in the audience with us here. %$* 13
god could not make it tonight, i'm afraid, but we could-- %$* 13
we did pretty well. %$* 13
so let's go to some questions. %$* 13
sir, right down-- %$* 13
far down-- %$* 13
the microphone is right behind you. %$* 13
and if you stand up and tell us your name. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
hi, my name is andrew. %$* 18
and i have a question for mr. %$* 18
huber. %$* 18
you mentioned that drugs should be approved without demonstrating clinical outcomes. %$* 18
and-- %$* 18
but it seems that there's a risk that if you don't have enough data, you will end up with drugs that harm more than they help. %$* 18
and dr. %$* 18
avorn mentioned the thalidomide case. %$* 18
i was wondering what you would say to the people and the families who would be harmed by a drug that is rushed to market before it's ready and before anybody knows that it's safe or effective. %$* 18
peter huber. %$* 13
the first thing i would say to them is my heart goes out to you. %$* 101
thalidomide was a terrible tragedy and it involved kids. %$* 101
and any parent, and i am one, that-- %$* 101
it just breaks your heart to read this, okay? %$* 101
i will add that it was a drug from the 1950s. %$* 101
and so, then, i would-- %$* 101
and then now, i'd like to tell you the follow-up on thalidomide. %$* 101
this does not excuse anything that was done back then. %$* 101
it wasn't, of course, licensed in the united states, but it was licensed abroad. %$* 101
you know that thalidomide is licensed as a drug in the united states today, you know? %$* 101
and you know it was-- %$* 101
in fact, it was given accelerated approval through the fda, was rushed through, and they used the-- %$* 101
an incredibly clever dodge-- %$* 101
whoever-- %$* 101
whichever lawyer thought of-- %$* 101
peter, i don't think the thrust of the question was about the-- %$* 13
well, well, just-- %$* 101
statistics of thalidomide. %$* 13
well-- %$* 101
it was just an example. %$* 13
just a second. %$* 101
the question is, when you don't understand a thing about what drugs are doing, you make horrendous mistakes. %$* 101
and we've made many in the past. %$* 101
and many of the examples, certainly in dr. %$* 101
avorn's book, are about misuse of estrogen, which dates way back, decades; and diet drugs, which have been used for all sorts of non-medical purposes and so on. %$* 101
you know, i-- %$* 101
nobody wants tragedies, but the way you don't-- %$* 101
i would rather prevent them than apologize for them and regret them. %$* 101
the pharmacoepidemiologists find them out late. %$* 101
the people who looked for the biomarkers that control how a drug performs find safety biomarkers too. %$* 101
dr. %$* 101
avorn has gotten-- %$* 101
has done important work on liver toxicity with a drug called rezulin. %$* 101
there are biomarkers for liver toxicity. %$* 101
we should be looking whether they're explaining the liver toxicity when you try the next rezulin. %$* 101
you get them on the label and you don't prescribe these things. %$* 101
let's fix problems, not just lament them. %$* 101
another question? %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
on the second row. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
sure. %$* 13
that's coming from your left side. %$* 13
if you could stand, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i didn't go to your side because i think that questioner was doing your work for you. %$* 13
but generally, questions can go to both sides. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is mitchell. %$* 18
i wanted to ask this question to the side against the motion. %$* 18
you talked about the fda's role in protecting broad public health. %$* 18
and i wanted to ask, what is the difference-- %$* 18
or how can you separate public health from the health of those individuals dying from the lack of a fast-tracked drug? %$* 18
and how can you say that a person should not be let to try this drug or they'd be-- %$* 18
are they living in the united states by permission of the government? %$* 18
well, you-- %$* 13
just to clarify. %$* 13
well, you said you were against the motion, but you're actually for the motion-- %$* 13
no. %$* 18
no. %$* 18
i-- %$* 18
no. %$* 18
i meant-- %$* 18
you're for the motion. %$* 13
target the question to the-- %$* 18
to the-- %$* 18
to the side against the motion. %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
right. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 18
but the rest is crystal clear. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
no, no-- %$* 13
it was. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
it’s a great question. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
the question is based on the premise-- %$* 296
well, there're two aspects. %$* 296
one is based on the premise that there are all these great drugs out there that the fda is keeping from people. %$* 296
and i would submit that that fact is simply incorrect. %$* 296
there are not a lot of great drugs out there that are being kept from people that we know work. %$* 296
now, you raise a second question, which is an interesting philosophical, libertarian issue. %$* 296
should the government ever say to a patient, “there's a chemical you want to take and you're-- %$* 296
you have a doctor that you found that wants to give it to you; we don't think you should have it because we don't think it's safe or effective.” i think there is a legitimate political difference within-- %$* 296
certainly on the stage and the audience. %$* 296
i believe that we need to have a governmental agency that does say, “yeah, you can't have that drug. %$* 296
and we don't know if it works. %$* 296
we have a system of drug approvals. %$* 296
it has not approved. %$* 296
no, you can't have it.” and that may be seen as a violation of individual freedom. %$* 296
but, you know, so is the right to, you know, go through red lights and a lot of other things are not in necessarily society's interest. %$* 296
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 295
i think we need to think about-- %$* 295
you're talking about the drugs that, you know, you don't see a whole plethora of drugs that just aren't available after they've been developed. %$* 295
i think we need to also think about the drugs that never get developed. %$* 295
i'll give you an example. %$* 295
polycystic kidney disease: basically, it's an inherited disorder where you build up cysts in your kidneys and eventually go on to have total renal failure. %$* 295
you're very familiar with it. %$* 295
fda says that in order to demonstrate efficacy for a drug for polycystic kidney disease, you have to see how many patients go on to have renal failure versus, let's say, a placebo, instead of looking at cyst formation. %$* 295
but the problem is it takes 30 years to develop renal failure as a result of polycystic kidney disease. %$* 295
if you could use a reduction in cyst formation as the endpoint in the trial and show that a new drug reduces the formation of cysts, it seems intuitive, you're not going to progress as quickly to renal failure. %$* 295
but they want you to look for the out-- %$* 295
the clinical outcome, renal failure. %$* 295
and guess what? %$* 295
companies have walked away from developing drugs for polycystic kidney disease. %$* 295
so those drugs just are simply aren't being developed. %$* 295
and that's what i worry most about. %$* 295
it's not the drugs that are getting licensed in europe and not here. %$* 295
it's the ones that simply aren't being developed. %$* 295
okay. %$* 13
another question. %$* 13
i would love to hear a female voice tonight. %$* 13
somewhere. %$* 13
am i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
maybe if-- %$* 13
i'm just not seeing it. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
hi. %$* 13
i'm sarah, and i'm actually a practicing physician. %$* 19
and i want to know, in this age of evidence-based medicine, and also, my concern about suggesting that my patients take a certain medication, how would i know, one, that this medication is efficacious? %$* 19
and two, that i'm not doing my patient any harm. %$* 19
i want to be able to know what the side effects of a certain medication may be. %$* 19
and i want to know how i might monitor a patient for identifying side effects. %$* 19
so-- %$* 19
doctor-- %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
can you focus-- %$* 13
it-- %$* 19
that actually into a form-- %$* 13
into-- %$* 13
and i know you can-- %$* 13
into a question. %$* 13
no-- %$* 19
if every drug were fast-tracked or allowed to be sorted out, how could a physician present a medication to a patient as being something that will help them and not harm them? %$* 19
scott or peter. %$* 13
i would be-- %$* 101
peter huber. %$* 13
i'd tell you what the very best systems are out there today, to my knowledge, okay? %$* 101
and they are the ones that have, unfortunately not mainly during the fda trials, but post-market, okay, accumulated huge databases of massive amounts of molecular data and clinical data. %$* 101
ibm is pioneering some of this work. %$* 101
their hiv computers outperform doctors. %$* 101
you give a patient profile, root of entry, the-- %$* 101
what country you're in, these things, and they are doing massive searches through very large amounts of molecular data, and they give you precision, custom-tailored-- %$* 101
the best possible prescriptions you can get. %$* 101
you get those prescriptions only when you've accumulated a lot of patient-specific data and a lot of clinical data. %$* 101
we should start doing that during the fda clinical trials. %$* 101
we don't. %$* 101
the question presupposes-- %$* 295
just because the doctor-- %$* 13
of the doctor's expertise-- %$* 13
and then i'll come back to you, scott. %$* 13
i just want-- %$* 13
if the mic is still with you, should the-- %$* 13
did the answer peter gave you actually-- %$* 13
is it something that you can work with? %$* 13
well, no. %$* 19
why? %$* 13
because medications, i think, are prescribed-- %$* 19
and i need to know-- %$* 19
and my area is rheumatology, and there are a lot of wonderful, magnificent drugs that have come out in the past ten years that have changed my patients' lives. %$* 19
but many of these drugs have very bad side effects, or potential side effects. %$* 19
that you wouldn't know about. %$* 13
and i wouldn't know about that, and-- %$* 19
all right, let me-- %$* 13
let me then stop you there and let scott gottlieb come in. %$* 13
the question presupposes that we actually know a lot about the drugs that go through the full-blown clinical trials versus the ones that go through the accelerated approval. %$* 295
and i would say that we don't. %$* 295
there's a lot that we don't know. %$* 295
and to pick on-- %$* 295
to pick up on your field, what do you think would happen if we randomized every nsaid on the market to placebo and did a ten-year cardiovascular outcome study? %$* 295
do you think that some of those nsaids would show the same cardiovascular risk that was shown with the vioxx which dr. %$* 295
avorn talked about? %$* 295
i suspect that they would. %$* 295
we don't know about the latent cardiovascular risks with most of the drugs on the market because we haven't looked for it, and we never will because it's impractical and impossible to do that study. %$* 295
so the advice i give patients, and take myself, is if i'm taking a drug, i make sure i really need it. %$* 295
oh, and to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: "the fda's caution is hazardous to our health." let's go to some more questions. %$* 13
ma'am, blue-- %$* 13
turquoise. %$* 13
my name is kathleen. %$* 19
i'm sorry, could you repeat, because your mic wasn't on. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
my name is kathleen. %$* 19
and my question is in reaction to something that dr. %$* 19
huber said, that certain drugs can be approved by the fda, put on the market, and then doctors can prescribe cocktails of these drugs to their patients, you know. %$* 19
and now, since a medical doctor is neither a chemist nor a pharmacologist, is this a wise practice? %$* 19
well, let me put it-- %$* 101
peter huber. %$* 13
this way. %$* 101
if you outlawed it, as some people suggest we should, or actually crack down-- %$* 101
and by the way, under the federal drug law, it's quite clear doctors have a right to practice off-label medicine. %$* 101
but oncology would essentially shut down if you actually prohibited this. %$* 101
oncology is all toolkits. %$* 101
"all" is not true, but some of the cocktails go through fda licensing scripts. %$* 101
the vast majority of oncology today is doctors looking at drugs that have a particular molecular medicine – a mechanism unknown. %$* 101
they understand, gee, if i do this to the breast cancer cell, i'll frac this receptor. %$* 101
and they're sequencing the tumor of multiple points in the body and are finding all sorts of different ways to attack it, and they’re-- %$* 101
that's how they do it. %$* 101
there's some areas you just have to do that. %$* 101
okay? %$* 101
is this ever done in areas other than oncology? %$* 19
look, look, many people my age and others, you know, are taking fistfuls of drugs all the time. %$* 101
i mean-- %$* 101
let me move onto a question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
yeah, right in the center there. %$* 13
my name is gary marcus. %$* 298
i have a question that's primarily for peter, but i'd like to hear everybody's response. %$* 298
it's prompted by your remark about bayesian statistics. %$* 298
i've been trying to work-- %$* 298
about what, sir? %$* 13
about particular kind of statistics. %$* 298
it was prompted by a view about statistics, but i'll make the question so you don't need to know the term. %$* 298
i'm trying to work out what your view is. %$* 298
and one view that i could imagine is we get really large databases, we get watson on the job. %$* 298
and then everything is entirely in the discretion of the doctors. %$* 298
is that the model that you're pushing? %$* 298
and if not, why not? %$* 298
i think, to tell you the truth, and i don't necessarily want to go here, i do-- %$* 101
i think i am quite confident that in our lifetimes, with this massive convergence of digital and biochemical technology and our ability to acquire all this data, we will get increasingly personalized. %$* 101
we will get to the point where the information is there, where the people best qualified to decide how to prescribe one or more drugs to this patient, will be the doctor and patient, because you've got a unique body there. %$* 101
you have a massive record of how things connect to each other. %$* 101
and bayesians know how to draw those networks. %$* 101
they're doing it-- %$* 101
but are the doctors-- %$* 298
i want to interrupt this "ask peter huber a question show" to let the other side answer questions. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
there is a tendency to believe that we can do anything with big data and that if we just let anyone use any chemicals they want and have a big enough database and a powerful enough computer, it'll all kind of come out in the wash. %$* 296
and i know a little bit about that because that's the kind of research we do in my division. %$* 296
and it doesn't work like that. %$* 296
the reason that we've had clinical trials of the randomized kind for the last many decades is that that's a very powerful tool for learning what works and what doesn't. %$* 296
and saying, “we'll just observe a whole lot of people and see how they do,” is not going to give us the answer. %$* 296
i think the physicians' question is a really key one. %$* 296
the time that we get information about how well a drug works and what its side effects are is heavily centered on the fda evaluation and the studies the companies bring to the fda. if we shortcut that, we lose the opportunity to really understand the question that physicians face every day: how well does it work, and how well can i trade off those benefits for the risks that i know that it might also cause? %$* 296
and if we don't collect that information, we're all just kind of shooting blind when we prescribe those drugs in the future. %$* 296
okay. %$* 13
pete-- %$* 13
celebrity pete dominick. %$* 13
celebrity pete dominick, i'd like to direct my question to jim and ask him who he's voting for, but-- %$* 299
i guess for me, the most interesting thing to come out of this tonight that i have learned is that the fda receives a salary funded by the agency which it's supposed to police. %$* 299
i think it’s disconcerting to most americans that our regulatory agencies are captured; the sec by wall street, the-- %$* 299
you know, the epa perhaps in the last administration with oil. %$* 299
i would-- %$* 299
is this not a concern for us? %$* 299
why would we allow the pharmaceutical industry or any other medical industry to finance the salaries-- %$* 299
subsidize salaries of those who are supposed to be policing it? %$* 299
scott gottlieb, first, is it accurate? %$* 13
well, look, there's a lot of federal-- %$* 295
is it an accurate portrayal? %$* 13
is it accurate, what, that the fda's captured by the industry because the user fees help fund-- %$* 295
well, you don't necessarily need to use that language, but the-- %$* 13
no, it's not accurate. %$* 295
i mean, there's a long precedent of user fees being used to help offset the costs of government agencies, state agencies, federal agencies, other models for it in the federal government. %$* 295
you're paying, really, for the review times, the review process. %$* 295
you're not paying for the outcome. %$* 295
and i think that there is something to be said for the industry that's regulated sitting down periodically with the agency that regulates it to talk about how that process is working and to help talk about how funds can be provided to improve how that process is working. %$* 295
there is-- %$* 295
this actually works. %$* 295
and if you look back at the original pdufa legislation, written into that legislation was language from congress describing to fda how to hold a meeting. %$* 295
now, i would say fda's management, and the management of the drug review process, is a whole lot better today as a result of the user fees. %$* 295
and they don't need instructions from congress anymore on how to hold a meeting. %$* 295
but that's the way it was back then. %$* 295
and the user fees are a big reason that the management of that agency has improved so much. %$* 295
would this side like to respond? %$* 13
david challoner? %$* 13
well, i remain troubled-- %$* 297
by the fact that 40 to 50 percent of what the commissioner of the fda has to consider, in this case her staff, is funded by the industries that she is supposedly regulating. %$* 297
that's got to fit into her equations somewhere. %$* 297
one of the other interesting things-- %$* 297
how would that play to our-- %$* 13
seriously, how would that play to our motion? %$* 13
does that make for an fda that is less cautious by design than you would want it to be? %$* 13
no. %$* 297
to me, it still means that we have to make sure the fda is as cautious as it is and continues to be. %$* 297
i'll tell you-- %$* 295
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
you never think about it. %$* 295
i mean, i worked in the agency for a number of years, and the fact that the agency was partially funded through user fees-- %$* 295
it's effectively become a tax. %$* 295
it's not a user fee anymore. %$* 295
the industry knows they're going to have to pay it. %$* 295
they're not going to be able to withdraw it. %$* 295
it's not even a thought. %$* 295
sir. %$* 13
and after this, i think we have time for one more question. %$* 13
yes, david, i'm an oncologist. %$* 18
but my question really is to dr. %$* 18
huber. %$* 18
dr. %$* 18
gottlieb makes the point that-- %$* 18
for polycystic-- %$* 18
and there's so many other disease that the-- %$* 18
big pharma will not finance and not put money into it to develop drugs for much-needed diseases because it won't make money for them. %$* 18
and the fda, by-- %$* 18
i don't want to say by lawn-cutting, by making these 10 years' worth of data for all these different phases will make it impractical for many diseases to be looked at by the big pharma. %$* 18
david-- %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
it is an important question as to when you can use a surrogate measure, the kind that was discussed for polycystic kidneys or other conditions, and when you have to wait for a clinical outcome. %$* 296
but it's not the case that the fda doesn't look at surrogate measures. %$* 296
in fact, it does all the time in order to speed drug review. %$* 296
they have something called a critical path initiative which is designed to figure out when can you use a surrogate measure and when you have to wait for a clinical event. %$* 296
but there's a downside to surrogate measures we can't forget out. %$* 296
a surrogate measure used to approve diabetes drugs was whether your blood sugar does down. %$* 296
most of us thought that was a great idea until it turned out that avandia lowers your blood sugar and causes heart attacks. %$* 296

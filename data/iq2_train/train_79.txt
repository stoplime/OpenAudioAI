i want to thank you all very, very much for making it out this evening and for making this a sellout, the first night of the new series. %$* 13
and i would like to turn it over to chris browne of rockefeller university. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 286
i’m chris browne, i’m a member of the board of trustees here at the rockefeller university. %$* 286
a universally world-renowned center for research in the biomedical and biological sciences. %$* 286
i’m also a supporter of intelligence squared us and a long-time friend of its chairman, bob rosenkranz. %$* 286
we’ve known each other for so long that i won’t admit how long. %$* 286
but it’s been a while. %$* 286
it’s a special should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) pleasure for me to welcome you this evening, in which two organizations i admire are working together. %$* 286
rockefeller is providing the new and larger venue, enabling intelligence squared to better meet the demand for the elevated public discourse it supplies. %$* 286
bob rosenkranz will now be joining us, via videotape, to frame tonight’s discussion. %$* 286
thank you, and welcome. %$* 1
in the upcoming political campaign, we’re going to hear an awful lot about health care. %$* 1
the 45 million uninsured, are cited as a national scandal. %$* 1
and the efficiency of our current system is very questionable. %$* 1
our current health care system, consumes about 50 to 100 percent bigger piece of our national output, than health care in other rich countries, with very, very little to show for it, in the way of improved outcomes. %$* 1
those who favor a federally mandated universal coverage, argue that, it will produce greater efficiency, as the federal government drives private-sector costs down. %$* 1
it’ll promote better health outcomes, as we are able to have more early intervention, and more preventive medicine, and it’s more fair to the disadvantaged people in our society who are not getting the full benefits of, of health care coverage that our country can provide. %$* 1
on the other side of the argument, are those that rarely link the should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) terms “efficient” and “government” in the same sentence. %$* 1
they see the problem as grossly exaggerated. %$* 1
of the 45 million uninsured, many are young people who are relatively healthy, people who can easily afford medical coverage but elect not to buy insurance, illegal immigrants, and people who are eligible for medicaid but have not enrolled. %$* 1
they think that the inefficiencies in the system, are caused by the fact that most consumers of medical care don’t pay for the service directly, and therefore, have no incentive to control costs. %$* 1
and finally on the subject of fairness, universal care may be seen as simply a way of compelling healthy young people, to subsidize the cost of providing health care to their less healthy elders. %$* 1
to discuss these very timely matters we have a truly outstanding panel with us tonight, and it’s my real pleasure to introduced john donvan, our new moderator, and the radio voice of intelligence squared, on the 150 national public radio stations that carry these debates. %$* 1
john is an emmy award-winning journalist, with 20 years at abc news, most recently at nightline. %$* 1
he’s been a white house correspondent, and a foreign correspondent, in moscow, jerusalem, amman, iraq. %$* 1
john, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
and i would also like to invite a round of applause for robert rosenkranz whose vision makes these evenings possible, normally he’s here in should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) person but— i am john donvan, your host and moderator, for intelligence squared us, i am with abc news nightline but tonight it is a pleasure to be introducing and moderating these debates, intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating on america’s shores, the motion for tonight’s debate as you know, “universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility.” you are going to be hearing from six panelists throughout the program, three who are for this motion, and three of whom are against, we’re going to have a three-part debate, the first part, the most substantial part in a certain way will be opening statements, each of the speakers in turn will be given seven minutes to make the case, i want to clue you in there is a sound that you will hear at the six-minute mark, it’s a warning sound telling them that they’re running out of time and it sounds like— very gentle sound, and— it can become more insistent and at the seven-minute mark it will become rather relentless like this. %$* 13
all righty. %$* 13
all righty. %$* 13
we’re going to poll you both before and after the debate because, the point here, is to win the room. %$* 13
these debaters are trying to persuade you to their point of view, everyone comes in here with a point of view or the absence of a point of view known as undecided. %$* 13
we’re going to poll you to should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) find out what our baseline is coming in but this is in a sense a contest, it’s not quite a reality show but it is a contest, it’s a contest of wits and facts and information and persuasion, and all of you are the umpires, you are the referees, you are the judges in this. %$* 13
we will also, later in the program, after the opening statements, we’ll be coming to you for questions, and then the evening concludes with each of the debaters taking two minutes to sum up and reach a summary position, at that point we will vote again, to find out how they did, who were the winners of the evening. %$* 13
so, once again the topic, to reiterate, “universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility,” if you go to the keypads attached to your seats at this point %$* 13
number 1 means that you are for the motion, number 2, you are against the motion, number 3, you at this point are undecided. %$* 13
please vote. %$* 13
does anyone need more time? %$* 13
it was pretty simple. %$* 13
so in a short time we’ll have the results to share with you but we want to begin now, with the opening statements, once again our topic, “universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility,” and arguing first for the motion, should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) paul krugman, a well-known op-ed columnist for the new york times and i want to point out that in an era when many of us were beginning to refer to our potatoes as freedom fries, paul krugman stood up and talked about the french when it comes to health care, in some ways, doing it better than the united states, and the germans, and the koreans %$* 13
paul krugman, the podium is yours. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 287
so i’m an economist which means i’m supposed to talk about efficiency, but i actually want to start, by talking about morality. %$* 287
and in fact i don’t want to start by talking about health care. %$* 287
let me talk about something that’s going on right now. %$* 287
as we sit here there are several million people in the houston metropolitan area, who are without electricity or running water. %$* 287
been hit by disaster, they didn’t do anything wrong. %$* 287
they stayed in their houses because that was what they were advised by the governor of texas to do, it was the right thing to do given the impossibility of evacuating a city that size and now, a lot of them are in trouble. %$* 287
some of them can manage, some of them can now go and stay with relatives, some are in good health and, others are not, they’re in a lot of trouble. %$* 287
now, do we think that the people who are in trouble, who are elderly, who are in poor health, who just should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) don’t have the financial resources, whatever, to get themselves out of that situation, do we believe that, well look, you know, it’s not a government responsibility to help them, they should be left on their own. %$* 287
well of course we don’t, i mean, i imagine there are some people who do believe that, but not many. %$* 287
they certainly don’t show their heads in our american politics. %$* 287
we do believe that if our fellow citizens suffer misfortune that is no fault of their own, and we can help them, that we should. %$* 287
now imagine, some american who is in poor health and can’t afford medical care. %$* 287
some american who is elderly and in need, trouble, or maybe not elderly, something’s gone wrong, someone who is trying to work but can’t get a job that has health insurance, someone who is in difficulty. %$* 287
do we believe that that’s their problem, that we should not be taking care of them. %$* 287
and by the way, we’re not just talking about the 45 million without health insurance. %$* 287
we’re also talking about the roughly 75 million people who have inadequate health insurance. %$* 287
health insurance that basically crumples, whenever it’s put to the need, we’re talking about a large part of this country, that does not have adequate health care coverage. %$* 287
well i would submit to you that actually as a nation, we don’t believe that it’s appropriate to leave these people on their own. %$* 287
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) that we actually believe that the right thing to do is to help people, we don’t think that people should be protected from all of the risks of life but when there is something you can do, we believe that we should do it. %$* 287
and in fact by and large, if you ask people, should people have health coverage in this country, should people be guaranteed health care, most polls i’ve seen say that a heavy majority of the public thinks that they should. %$* 287
so then the question would be, well how is it that we don’t actually have that, how is it that we haven’t actually taken care of our citizens in the way that overwhelmingly, as a nation, we believe is the morally right thing to do, that as a matter of values, we think we oughta do. %$* 287
and the answer is of course that we’re told %$* 287
well actually we’re told two things. %$* 287
we’re told first of all, that we already do it. %$* 287
that we already take care of everybody, and we’re also told, that it’s impossible to take care of everybody. %$* 287
now you might think that it was impossible to believe both those things at the same time but, that’s why these guys are paid the big bucks. %$* 287
so we’re told that, well, look— and i can quote the president there. %$* 287
“i mean people have got access to health care in america. %$* 287
after all you just go to an emergency room.” and of course-- %$* 287
i think we probably have a fair number of doctors here right-- %$* 287
you know, it ain’t the same thing. %$* 287
first of all, going into emergency is no substitute for continuing care. %$* 287
and secondly, if should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) you go to an emergency room, they will bill you. %$* 287
now if you’re indigent, we’ve got the care all the same but you will get the bill and if you’re indigent maybe that doesn’t matter, but, for working americans who don’t have good incomes, they’re terrified of emergency room coverage, and it’s—there’s something sick about our debate, that anybody can even claim that the emergency room is a substitute for universal health care. %$* 287
but the other argument is that it’s impossible. %$* 287
that if you try to have some form of universal health care, it’ll be terrible. %$* 287
it’ll be lousy quality, it’ll be wildly expensive. %$* 287
so people are told that a government insurance system can’t possibly work. %$* 287
it will be lousy insurance, it’ll be awful, it’ll lead to awful care %$* 287
which, now we’re going to hear a little bit i think later on about some of the international evidence, we’re going to hear about other countries. %$* 287
but you know, i—there’s a secret, i don’t know if people know about it but you know, there’s this program called medicare. %$* 287
covers every american 65 and older. %$* 287
it is, horrors, it’s a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal government. %$* 287
when it was being proposed, people said it would be terrible. %$* 287
you may have heard of something called operation kaffeeklatsch. %$* 287
or you may not have heard of it. %$* 287
doctors’ wives were urged to should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) hold kaffeeklatsches, in which they would try to convince the doctors’ patients what a terrible idea this proposal called medicare was, and they would play a recording by a fellow named ronald reagan, explaining what a terrible idea medicare was and how it would lead, not only to destruction of health care, but actually the destruction of freedom, it’s quite something, you can listen to it online and, at the end, it basically says medicare is the root to a totalitarian state. %$* 287
well, it’s become as american as apple pie. %$* 287
famous quote among, in the health care field is the, constituent who accosted senator john breaux saying, senator, don’t let the government get its hands on medicare. %$* 287
the fact of the matter is we have universal health coverage for our elderly already. %$* 287
the other thing that people say is that it would be impossibly expensive. %$* 287
now, the truth is, a little-known other big secret, really have to go in deep research and actually look at a couple of official statistics that are easily available to find this out— in this country, the government already pays more health care bills than private insurers do. %$* 287
medicare and medicaid together, are already a bigger program than private insurance, all private health insurance. %$* 287
the reason is that we already cover the expensive cases. %$* 287
we already have the expensive cases. %$* 287
the elderly, the very sick who end up being bankrupted and therefore end up poor enough to get should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) medicaid are covered by public programs. %$* 287
what’s left, are generally lower-income working adults, and we pay an enormous amount to not cover them. %$* 287
the fact of the matter is that our health care system is wildly inefficient, largely because we have an insurance industry that devotes enormous resources to try to identify who really needs health insurance, so as not to give it to them. %$* 287
and we have health care providers devoting enormous resources, fighting with the insurance companies, to actually get paid. %$* 287
and the result is a wildly inefficient system. %$* 287
it would be cheaper, by far, to just cover everybody. %$* 287
we pay this huge price because we’ve managed to convince ourselves, or be convinced, that somehow, something that every other advanced country does, and that every other—that we do ourselves for the elderly, is impossible. %$* 287
thank you— %$* 287
paul krugman, thank you very much. %$* 13
pretty well- timed actually. %$* 13
speaking against the motion, john stossel, my colleague from abc news, but we did not discuss this ahead of time, in fact, though both of us have worked a quarter-century at abc news we’ve never met until tonight. %$* 13
bizarrely enough, separate orbits i suppose. %$* 13
i kept my feet on the ground. %$* 13
john stossel’s hard-nosed take on many a liberal policy should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) assumption is summed up in his catch-phrase, “gimme a break.” tonight in a sense we’re discussing, what if you break your arm, or your neck %$* 13
should the federal government be there to provide your insurance safety net, john stossel, here to argue against that idea and the motion tonight. %$* 13
it is intuitive to think that it should, that we have %$* 288
very poor and helpless people and it’s the job of government, to help them, and, actually we have that, we have medicaid. %$* 288
if you are poor, you are covered in america. %$* 288
it’s not a good system. %$* 288
it’s tempting to think that a wise government could step in. %$* 288
paul krugman has just said look at medicare, people like medicare. %$* 288
and that’s true. %$* 288
but, of course they like it, because, it gives you stuff free. %$* 288
people like that. %$* 288
but it’s unsustainable, it’s $35 trillion in the hole. %$* 288
that’s the unfounded liability of medicare. %$* 288
they made promises to cover us when we’re 75, when the panel is 75, there’s no way they can possibly do that. %$* 288
right now it’s working, because there are lots of young people and relatively few older people, but there’s just no way it can be sustained, if a private company tried to run its pension system that way i bet they’d throw the owners in jail. %$* 288
it’s a ponzi scheme. %$* 288
now, some people will talk tonight about the widely publicized data that america spends the most on health care, and we do, and studies should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) have found that we have the worst result. %$* 288
but those studies are deceitful. %$* 288
they compare us by how long we live. %$* 288
but americans are different. %$* 288
we drive cars more. %$* 288
we kill each other more often. %$* 288
our accident rate, deaths on the highways triple that of the united kingdom, we murder each other 10 times as often as the united kingdom. %$* 288
when you take that out, we live longer than those other countries. %$* 288
and that doesn’t even include, diet issues, because we eat more and that kills people. %$* 288
a lot of these studies are skewed to make america look bad. %$* 288
now many people say that the perfect system is in europe where you have universal health care, and it’s true—most other countries do have systems like that. %$* 288
and it gets rid of the horrible anxiety that some people have in america, will i be covered. %$* 288
and that is horrible, and that does make people sick. %$* 288
but it’s better to be anxious, than to be in horrible pain. %$* 288
or to be dead. %$* 288
and these universal coverage systems, they don’t guarantee universal access to actual care. %$* 288
in canada, more than a million families can’t get a doctor. %$* 288
we taped in one town in ontario where they have a lottery, they have a little box, everybody puts the family name in and, the town clerk pulls out a name, oh, you get to see a doctor this week. %$* 288
there aren’t enough doctors to go around, in britain, one in eight patients waits more than a year for should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) treatment in a hospital. %$* 288
the journal clinical oncology says 20 percent of potentially curable lung cancer patients, become incurable on the waiting list. %$* 288
now why does this happen, well, because when everything is free, when the government pays for it %$* 288
everybody wants everything. %$* 288
but the government doesn’t have infinite money so the government then must ration. %$* 288
and they do it by not giving you the latest, most expensive stuff, or they make you wait in line. %$* 288
in one town in england they opened a, a new office where you could get dental treatment, people lined up for blocks. %$* 288
now most of them didn’t get in, so people pull their own teeth. %$* 288
the dental tools are pliers and vodka. %$* 288
this is not a good way to live. %$* 288
still, despite the fact they spend less, european care is not remarkably inferior, it’s pretty good for most people. %$* 288
but that’s true only because they freeload off of us. %$* 288
because most of the innovation comes from america. %$* 288
from the greedy profit-driven companies that want to take as much money from you as they possibly can, they’re the ones who gave us so much good stuff, the mri’s, the ct scans. %$* 288
ace inhibitors to lower blood pressure. %$* 288
the statins like lipitor, to reduce cholesterol, coronary bypass surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement. %$* 288
what will the world be like if we have universal care and we don’t have america to should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) invent those things? %$* 288
yes, the private market is awful in many ways and wasteful. %$* 288
health insurance companies waste all this money on advertising, paperwork, duplication, claims officers trying to make sure you’re not cheating ‘em. %$* 288
it is intuitive to think a single payer would be more efficient. %$* 288
and michael rachlis who will speak shortly has written that, a public bureaucracy is cheaper. %$* 288
and, i used to believe that, when i attended paul krugman’s university i was taught that, that the wise elites in washington and state capitol can plan these things better than these competing companies. %$* 288
but then i became a consumer reporter, and i watched the market work. %$* 288
i watched government and private greedy companies trying to deliver services to people. %$* 288
and now i say that’s nonsense, government can’t do anything even close to the efficient way that private companies do it. %$* 288
when government pays for things, people don’t change, they don’t innovate, they keep doing the same thing they did to get paid. %$* 288
so, as an example look at the inefficiency of the private car companies. %$* 288
they waste millions in advertising on my program, i’m glad they do. %$* 288
and they run these gross ads, they sell cars not based on their engineering perfection or safety, they sell sex and muscle cars. %$* 288
they have these competing dealerships and pushy salesmen selling things like rust-proofing that we don’t need. %$* 288
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) despite all of that, what’s the worst you get when you buy a car in new york? %$* 288
the worst you can get, is better than this, this is what the planned economies %$* 288
universal coverage gives us, and i apologize to those of you on the radio, you can’t see i’m holding up a picture of the trabant, that east german car. %$* 288
this was the best those brilliant east german engineers could produce, it was an awful car, you had to put the oil and gas separately and shake the car to mix ‘em together. %$* 288
as soon as the berlin wall went down, this disappeared, because it couldn’t compete with the mediocre products that produced—were produced by our competing companies. %$* 288
i don’t want to have this kind of health care, and that’s what we’ll get if government runs it, at the beginning, government could do things well, you get the peace corps, new york’s public schools. %$* 288
but after a while it deteriorates because they don’t change, they don’t improve, maybe once every 12 years they change a little. %$* 288
if we have universal health care, this is what we’ll get. %$* 288
thank you, john stossel. %$* 13
we have a canadian in the house tonight, michael rachlis. %$* 13
a physician who— maybe we have a lot of canadians in the house tonight. %$* 13
michael rachlis is a physician who has lived on the should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) other side of the us-canada border, he trained in canada, he practices medicine there. %$* 13
he is a health policy expert there. %$* 13
and given that canada so often is the example cited as— for why universal coverage is the solution or why universal coverage is the problem, we are pleased to have michael rachlis standing at our podium to argue for the motion, “universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility,” michael. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 289
and i’d like to thank the rosenkranz foundation and intelligence squared very much for inviting me to new york, i’ve had a wonderful time while i’ve been here. %$* 289
i also have a strong personal connection to the united states, my wife is an american and i visit her family on a regular basis and see the great health care that the united states has, and the terrible health care that this country has. %$* 289
and one is given to her father and one is given to her uncle, and the difference is insurance coverage. %$* 289
i’ve also slept overnight, i don’t want to give the impression i sleep around but, i’ve slept overnight in 23 us states and i have a pretty good idea of the health care system in this country as even my daughter has used it when she had a catfish spine through her palm in florida. %$* 289
now, as paul has said, that this is very much a question of values. %$* 289
and it’s actually a case where you can have your cake should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) and eat it too, in fact, you can only eat your cake if you have it, in other words, you can only get cost control if you—if you have equity. %$* 289
and as paul has said, as we’ve heard others say, the us system costs the most in the world, it denies care to tens of millions of americans and i have seen that personally. %$* 289
and the international performance and quality is just so-so. %$* 289
does this really reflect american values. %$* 289
is this really what you want out of your health care system. %$* 289
in canada, our values for health care go back to tommy douglas, the premier of saskatchewan between 1944 and 1961.and when tommy was a boy in my hometown of winnipeg, manitoba, he developed osteomyalitis, an infection in his leg. %$* 289
there were no antibiotics at the time, the recommendation of the doctors were that his leg should be amputated. %$* 289
fortunately dr. %$* 289
robert smith, a noted surgeon, saw douglas, told him that because he was an interesting case, he would treat him for free if he allowed teaching students to-- %$* 289
allowed dr. %$* 289
smith to teach with him. %$* 289
douglas was left with the impression all his life if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to run into dr. %$* 289
smith and be interesting, he would’ve lost his leg. %$* 289
then a few years later, after douglas’s government in saskatchewan had implemented universal hospital insurance and universal medical insurance, despite the fact that in the 1940s being the poorest province in should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) canada, justice emmett hall, a supreme court justice in canada, and if anything a conservative, was asked by our then- prime minister, john george diefenbaker, to review our health care system. %$* 289
his conclusion, was that we should move ahead with medical insurance ‘cause we already had hospital insurance. %$* 289
the main reason he gave was, efficiency. %$* 289
he said that it would be a lot cheaper to have a single-payer system, than to have multiple private payers. %$* 289
and so his vote was for efficiency. %$* 289
and those are the values on which our system are based. %$* 289
equity and efficiency. %$* 289
what are the results? %$* 289
fifty years ago we had the same as your country. %$* 289
we had the same health status. %$* 289
we paid the same amount for health care. %$* 289
fifty years later, all canadians are covered for hospitals and physicians service. %$* 289
in the united states millions have no coverage, and tens of millions have, have inadequate insurance. %$* 289
we actually get more of most services than americans do. %$* 289
we have more visits to doctors every year, more days in hospital, more days in nursing homes, we take more prescription drugs than you do. %$* 289
i mean, not all of these things are good, too much health care can kill you. %$* 289
but even though there are some services we don’t get as much of, like nobody in the world does as much cardiac interventions as you do, the belgians are close, but nobody really else is close, we should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) actually do more bone marrow transplants. %$* 289
we do more lung transplant surgery. %$* 289
toronto is an international center for lung transplants. %$* 289
and that, far from lacking innovation, we’re the country that brought you insulin, we developed bone marrow transplantation. %$* 289
when paul tsongas was telling the electorate years ago that he wouldn't have got his service in canada, it greatly offended the two people, two doctors in toronto who had developed the procedure. %$* 289
and all of this costs way less, ten percent of our gdp compared to sixteen percent in your country. %$* 289
how does that happen? %$* 289
well, half of the extra expense is administration, because of the extra expense of this multiple payer system. %$* 289
the other half is due to higher prices because you don’t have effective cost control because you don’t have a single payer. %$* 289
now, this must cost us a fortune, we must be basket cases. %$* 289
the canadian federal government has run surpluses equal to one to two percent of our gdp for eleven years in a row. %$* 289
there’s no problem affording health care when you do it because you're concerned about other people. %$* 289
then you can make it affordable. %$* 289
and our health status, of course, is not a true reflection, but in other, but from what you’ll hear, perhaps, from these panelists and others, you’d imagine canadians are dying in the street waiting for medical care. %$* 289
in fact, we now live three years longer on average than you do. %$* 289
this is over a fifty year period, we’ve now got a three year longer life expectancy. %$* 289
our should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) infant mortality rates are twenty to thirty percent lower than yours. %$* 289
and finally, it’s a great boon to business in our country. %$* 289
the province of ontario has, the last couple of years, has been assembling more motor vehicles than any us state including michigan. %$* 289
the costs to manufacturers are nine percent of payroll for health care costs in this country, one and a half percent in canada. %$* 289
that our manufacturing center is under pressure, but it would be gone without our health care system. %$* 289
so, canada has done well, but canada is not the outlier. %$* 289
canada is the outlier in north america. %$* 289
around the world wealthy countries, all wealthy countries that americans would think of when they think of other countries they could live in, with a comparable standard of living, all other countries have a mainly public system. %$* 289
and canada does have problems in its system, just as every country has its problems. %$* 289
our problems are second order problems. %$* 289
we’ve dealt with coverage, and we’ve mainly dealt with affordability. %$* 289
so we, we have waits and delays in canada, they're improving, but we do have them. %$* 289
but france and germany have much shorter waits for care than you do in this country. %$* 289
so, despite the individual anecdotes that you're going to hear, health care in canada or germany or france are remarkably similar to the us.a recent letter to the editor by lou holman from rochester new york reported on his heart attack in toronto while he was visiting, and he was having his surgery within one hour of calling should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) the ambulance. %$* 289
so, let’s get serious. %$* 289
health care is pretty standard in most developed countries, we have similar problems in delivery, you are the only ones that really have problems with coverage and affordability. %$* 289
so, it comes back to values. %$* 289
if you focus on equity, you get a bonus. %$* 289
you get cost control. %$* 289
if you focus on cost control, you don’t get equity or cost control. %$* 289
and i strongly encourage you folks to vote for our side. %$* 289
thank you. %$* 289
thank you michael rachlis. %$* 13
i am john donvan, and this is intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating. %$* 13
we have six panelists for and against the motion. %$* 13
the motion in this debate is, “universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility.” we are halfway through the opening statements at this point, halfway to our q&a section, but i’d now like to introduce, arguing against the motion, sally pipes, author of the top ten myths of american health care: a citizen’s guide. %$* 13
she is president and chief executive officer of the pacific research institute, a think tank based in california. %$* 13
she also comes from canada, but not only does she argue against this motion, two years ago she completed a personal journey and became a citizen of the united states. %$* 13
sally pipes. %$* 13
and i'm still canadian, and proud of it. %$* 290
i am against the should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) proposition that universal coverage should be the responsibility of the federal government. %$* 290
i do think that everyone here would agree that the key goal for america is affordable, accessible, quality health care. %$* 290
the question is, how do we achieve that goal? %$* 290
there are two competing visions for health care reform in this country today, and also for achieving universal coverage. %$* 290
one focuses on government, mandates, and taxes, while the other focuses on free markets, innovation, and empowering consumers. %$* 290
today that government vision is on the rise. %$* 290
the long term goal of most liberals is a canadian-style, single payer, medicare for all, health care system. %$* 290
these liberals tell us that socialized systems like those in canada and europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all of us. %$* 290
they also site, as michael did, life expectancy and infant mortality as evidence of the superiority of these systems. %$* 290
well, let’s look at life expectancy. %$* 290
people who make this claim usually note that life expectancy is higher in canada and europe. %$* 290
the world health organization ranking does not measure, though, the quality of a health care system. %$* 290
the world health organization ranks systems that treat people equally higher than those that treat people well. %$* 290
now let’s look at infant mortality. %$* 290
the us does have a higher infant mortality rate than canada, hence their government system is rated better. %$* 290
the reality is that the united states, with its superior neo-natal care facilities, has should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) allowed more high risk babies to live. %$* 290
but this also pushes the infant mortality rate higher because of a greater number of at risk births, babies being born. %$* 290
and in other countries many of those at risk babies do not live and are not counted in infant mortality statistics. %$* 290
earlier this year, a woman in calgary was expecting quadruplets, there wasn’t a single neo-natal unit for that woman to deliver her babies. %$* 290
she was airlifted to great falls, montana, a city of fifty-five thousand, where she successfully delivered her quads. %$* 290
i'm from vancouver, canada, i was home three years ago visiting my mom, and the front page story in the vancouver sun was, “pregnant mother with twins airlifted to edmonton, alberta.” when they came back, the husband, in the interview, on the front page of the sun said, the canadian health care system is that of a third world country. %$* 290
now let’s look at adult cancer survival rates. %$* 290
a study published in the august, august issue of the british journal lancet oncology said that america is much better at treating cancer than europe or canada. %$* 290
researchers found that americans have a better survival rate for thirteen of the sixteen most prominent cancers. %$* 290
for example, breast cancer survival rate among american women is eighty-three point five percent, whereas in britain, seventy percent. %$* 290
american men and women are thirty- five percent more likely to survive colon cancer than their british counterparts. %$* 290
now, i have discussed the data, but let’s look at should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) the reality of universal coverage systems in canada and europe. %$* 290
michael moore, in his movie sicko, where i have a cameo appearance, points to the wonderful health care systems in canada, france, england, and cuba, and he says they're all free. %$* 290
the us does spend, as has been pointed out, sixteen percent of its gross domestic product on health care, while canada spends on the range of ten to eleven percent. %$* 290
the reason that canada spends ten to eleven percent is because the government sets a global budget and says, that’s what we’re spending. %$* 290
and what is the result? %$* 290
long waiting lists for care, rationed care, and a lack of access to the latest technological equipment. %$* 290
today in canada there are eight hundred and twenty-seven thousand canadians waiting on a waiting list for procedures. %$* 290
there are three point two million, or ten percent of our population, waiting to get a primary care doctor. %$* 290
the average wait in 2007 from seeing a primary car doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was eighteen point three weeks. %$* 290
that’s over four months. %$* 290
canada ranks thirteenth out of twenty-four oecd countries in mri’s, and eighteenth out of twenty-four in ct scans. %$* 290
when i turned fifty, i know it’s hard to believe that i turned fifty, but i did, my doctor in san francisco said, you have to have a colonoscopy. %$* 290
and i said, well, there’s nothing wrong with me, i don’t need a colonoscopy. %$* 290
well anyway, i had one. %$* 290
but my mother in vancouver, canada, three years ago, july, started feeling ill and should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) was convinced she had colon cancer. %$* 290
but her doctor kept saying, you're old, there’s nothing wrong with you, go to bed, sleep more. %$* 290
finally in december my mom started hemorrhaging from her colon. %$* 290
her doctor said, you have to go to the hospital in an ambulance to get service in the emergency room-- %$* 290
i could not take her. %$* 290
after being in the emergency room for a number of hours she was then transferred to the transit lounge where she waited for two days to get a bed in a room. %$* 290
but she was not counted as waiting in an emergency room because she was in a transit lounge. %$* 290
the issue is that she was too old, it was decided by the health care system, to have a colonoscopy, when she was convinced that she was ill. %$* 290
and what about people with government coverage wait and wait in socialized systems, except the politicians. %$* 290
belinda stronach, former canadian mp, opposed any privatization of canadian health care. %$* 290
and yet, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in june of 2007, on the advice of her doctor, she flew to ucla and had her breast surgery and paid for it herself. %$* 290
as my friend in vancouver, dr. %$* 290
brian day, orthopedic surgeon, and head of the cma, canadian medical association, told the new york times, canada is a country in which your dog can get a hip replacement in under a week, and in which humans wait two to three years. %$* 290
is this the kind of government run health care system americans desire? %$* 290
think about the post office. %$* 290
think about the dmv and the handling of should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) katrina. %$* 290
a majority of americans rate the quality of our, our system as excellent, or good. %$* 290
in canada, according to decima, only thirty-three percent rate the system as a grade a or b, and twenty-two percent say it’s failing. %$* 290
canadians intuitively know that long waits are the outcomes of government run systems. %$* 290
while we can no longer deny there are problems in health care, markets, consumer choice, and innovation will solve them, rather than putting the government in charge. %$* 290
thank you, sally pipes. %$* 13
you owe me eight seconds. %$* 13
striding to the lectern now is art kellermann, who is a surgeon at the er at grady memorial hospital, atlanta’s public hospital. %$* 13
he’s also professor of emergency medicine at emory. %$* 13
and given that, as we know, so often the solution that the uninsured come to when they need medical care is to go to an emergency room, and it’s extremely valuable to us to have on the panel somebody who is at the receiving end of that process. %$* 13
i give you art kellermann. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 291
actually, i'm not a surgeon, i am just an er doc, and i don’t have the distinguished background of my fellow panelists, but i have treated thousands of patients, insured and uninsured, should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) and i’ve also broken bad news to hundreds of families. %$* 291
i want to tell you about one of them that i’ll never forget. %$* 291
it took them two hours to reach atlanta from the north georgia mountains. %$* 291
i faced them across the outstretched body of their son. %$* 291
the ventilator hissed rhythmically, ten breaths per minute. %$* 291
i spoke first. %$* 291
your son was in a terrible crash, i said. %$* 291
the ambulance crew could tell he was severely injured and called a helicopter. %$* 291
he reached us about three hours ago. %$* 291
he has several injuries, a collapsed lung, internal bleeding, but these aren't his most serious problem. %$* 291
his brain injury worries us the most. %$* 291
that’s when his mother interrupted me. %$* 291
she said, doctor, i don't know how to ask you this, but i must. %$* 291
my husband lost his job six weeks ago, i work, but my employer doesn't offer health insurance. %$* 291
is my son going to get the care he needs? %$* 291
momentarily taken aback, i replied, ma'am, you're at grady hospital, one of the finest trauma centers in the south, i swear to you, we will do everything in our power to save your son. %$* 291
i meant what i said that night, but i didn't tell her the whole truth. %$* 291
i didn't tell her that our best probably wouldn't be good enough, and that if her son survived he’d probably be disabled for the rest of his life. %$* 291
i didn't tell her that she and her husband would be billed for the helicopter flight, and the days or weeks to come in the intensive care unit, and that the total would probably reach a hundred thousand dollars, maybe a whole lot more. %$* 291
i didn't tell should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) her that she and her husband would empty their savings and mortgage their home in an effort to pay the bill, and that it wouldn't be enough. %$* 291
and that the coins put in a coffee can at the local diner wouldn't come close to covering the difference. %$* 291
i didn't tell her that the unpaid balance of her son’s bill will push grady hospital closer to insolvency, closer to its own crash, and if grady closes, north georgia, a region of more than five million people, will lose its only level one trauma center, its only burn unit, its only poison control center, its only emergency psychiatric unit, and seven hundred and fifty inpatient beds. %$* 291
and that’s not all. %$* 291
if grady closes, metro atlanta’s private hospitals, already overburdened by population growth, will topple like dominos one after another. %$* 291
ladies and gentleman, for me this debate is not an idle intellectual exercise, it’s about lives. %$* 291
three hundred million american lives. %$* 291
i support this resolution for three reasons. %$* 291
first, because our failure to cover every american is a national disgrace. %$* 291
second, because we’ll never achieve universal coverage if we don’t make health care in this country more affordable. %$* 291
and third, because the only way we can make health care more affordable and cover everyone is through a well-regulated health care marketplace, and to do that the federal government must be involved. %$* 291
now let me be clear, the majority of americans do not want a government-only health care system, but they absolutely want the government involved, as a should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) referee, as a cop, to make sure that everybody plays by the rules. %$* 291
the other side of this debate will try to convince you that rising health care costs are due to government interference. %$* 291
well, they’ve got it backwards. %$* 291
the problem is not government interference with the health care industry, the problem today is health care industry interference with government. %$* 291
that’s why the business of medicine is booming. %$* 291
record profits, huge executive salaries, bonuses, health care costs spiraling out of control year after year after year. %$* 291
but the caring side of medicine is failing. %$* 291
on the front lines, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are nearly as frustrated as you are. %$* 291
the nation-wide crisis in emergency care is a case in point. %$* 291
every major challenge we face, er’s packed with patients, dangerously long waits to be seen, a half million ambulances a year turned away to more distant hospitals, and fewer specialists than ever willing to take er call. %$* 291
all of them are due to the fact that the economics of health care encourage hospitals to favor elective cases over emergency cases. %$* 291
good for business, bad for patients. %$* 291
and it’s terribly expensive. %$* 291
country music star dolly parton once quipped, you have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap. %$* 291
the same can be said about american health care. %$* 291
you have no idea how much it costs to run this poorly. %$* 291
we spend two trillion dollars a year on health care, and a trillion dollars is a lot of money. %$* 291
put this in perspective, a million seconds ago was should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) last week. %$* 291
a billion seconds ago jimmy carter was inaugurated president. %$* 291
a trillion seconds ago was thirty thousand bc.for two trillion dollars we can take good care of everybody in this country and have a lot left over, and you don’t have to look outside the us for proof. %$* 291
if everybody practiced medicine as efficiently as they do in rochester, minnesota and salt lake city, utah, medicare could pay thirty percent less to doctors and hospitals, and everybody would get better care. %$* 291
but it won't happen on its own, because one person’s waste is another person’s revenue stream. %$* 291
that's why we need a cop on the beat, and the only cop with the clout to get the health care industry to play by the rules is the federal government. %$* 291
my side has given you several reasons to vote for tonight’s resolution, but the most compelling one of all is your own self interest, because a health care system that doesn't work for everyone may not work for you when the chips are down. %$* 291
take it from me, an er doc, no one can predict when a life threatening emergency may strike, but if it does, you’ll want your hospital to go the extra mile, not your ambulance. %$* 291
thank you. %$* 13
thank you art kellermann. %$* 13
our final speaker, speaking against the motion, is michael cannon. %$* 13
he is the director of health policy studies at the cato institute, which is the should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) nation’s leading think tank, formed around the philosophy of libertarianism, which can very crudely and primitively, simplistically be summed up as “live and let live.” but i suppose the question is, do you need insurance to follow through on that? %$* 13
michael is arguing against, broadly and firmly against the notion of universal health coverage being the responsibility of the federal government. %$* 13
michael? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 292
we do have a moral obligation to care for those who are in need of medical care, but that’s not where the disagreement lies tonight. %$* 292
where we disagree is over whether universal coverage is going to help us fulfill that moral obligation, or as i will argue, make that moral obligation harder to fulfill. %$* 292
so, you’ve heard a lot of things about how wonderful universal coverage will be. %$* 292
you’ve heard that it will probably be all things to all men and women. %$* 292
they’ll make us taller and thinner and it’ll save us money. %$* 292
so let’s look at a couple of the actual likely effects of adopting universal coverage here in the united states. %$* 292
first off, it’s not going to save us money. %$* 292
yes, other countries do universal coverage, and they do it on the cheap, or they do it for less money than we do, but there’s absolutely no way that can happen in the united states, and here’s why. %$* 292
expanding insurance coverage means more people are going to go to the doctor, more people are going to use medical services. %$* 292
that costs should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) more money. %$* 292
the urban institute estimates that it would cost at least a hundred and twenty billion dollars. %$* 292
that’s at least, it’s going to cost a lot more than that. %$* 292
now, with the government in control, it’s tempting to think that we would be able to ratchet that spending down over time so that we’re more in line with other, other nations. %$* 292
but with the government in control of the, whatever universal coverage scheme you can dream up, the industry is going to prevent the government from doing just that. %$* 292
art kellermann is right, the industry does have too much influence over government spending in the medicare program. %$* 292
and they use that influence to prevent the government from reducing, from reducing spending, from eliminating inefficient spending, wasteful spending. %$* 292
they’ve done it for medicare’s entire history. %$* 292
so although it’s tempting to think that we could do health, we could do universal coverage, and we could have, and we could save money on it in the process, we would have an easier time moving the uninsured to switzerland than we would have moving switzerland’s spending levels here to the united states. %$* 292
now, you’ve also heard that universal coverage would improve the quality of care. %$* 292
we actually have some pretty systemic problems when it comes to quality here in the united states. %$* 292
i'm not a big proponent of the us health care sector. %$* 292
the experts tell us that if you have, the uninsured only get recommended-- %$* 292
what the evidence says, is the best recommended should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) care about half of the time. %$* 292
but you know what, quality problems are so systemic that people in medicare, in medicaid, and people in the united kingdom’s national health service, which is their universal coverage system, also only get quality, what the evidence says is best care about half of the time. %$* 292
government, and then the reason is that government doesn't pay for quality, and it’s been lagging in the private sector in coming up with quality improving innovations. %$* 292
now in the private sector we have the same quality problem, but i’ll have more to say about that in a moment. %$* 292
one big quality problem is that we have alarming rates of medical error here in the united states. %$* 292
universal coverage is not going to help to prevent these medical errors. %$* 292
it’s not going to help nurses read doctors’ chicken scratchings and avoid the errors associated with those. %$* 292
it’s not going to encourage physicians and other clinicians to wash their hands between patients so they're not passing on infections. %$* 292
nor is it going to prevent errors by encouraging doctors to follow standardized protocols when inserting a central line. %$* 292
the same institute of medicine, i'm surprised this statistics hasn’t come up today, but i’ll bring it up, the institution of medicine, the commission where dr. %$* 292
kellermann served, estimated that eighteen thousand americans die every year from lack of health insurance. %$* 292
i believe that. %$* 292
that seems plausible to me. %$* 292
the same institute of medicine, however, estimated that up to a hundred should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) thousand americans die every year due to medical errors in hospitals. %$* 292
all universal coverage is going to do is bring more people into that system, broken system, it’s not going to do anything to fix that system. %$* 292
and yes, we might save the one, this one life over here, from this person who didn't have health insurance. %$* 292
we’d be ignoring these five deaths over here. %$* 292
another quality problem that we have in the united states is we have alarming disparities in health outcomes. %$* 292
we have disparities between different racial groups of fifteen to twenty years in terms of life expectancy. %$* 292
and some americans face mortality risks similar to what you see in russia and sub-saharan africa. %$* 292
universal coverage is not going to do anything to solve that problem. %$* 292
sherry glied, who’s the head of the mailman school of public health at columbia university wrote recently, quote, socio-economic differentials in health are large and growing, and appear to be growing, uh, in countries that have universal coverage as well as those that do not. %$* 292
end quote. %$* 292
now, it’s true, universal coverage may save some lives. %$* 292
it may save this one life over here. %$* 292
so that seems to be something in its favor. %$* 292
but actually here the news isn't even all that good, because health economists tell us that if you have a dollar to spend on improving health, there’s absolutely no evidence that spending that dollar on universal coverage is going to get your more of an improvement in health than spending that dollar on any number should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) of other things, including clinics, reducing medical errors, improving nutrition, fighting poverty, or even improving education. %$* 292
so, ironically, to vote for universal coverage does not show how much, how much you care about your neighbor’s health, it actually shows how little you care about your neighbor’s health, because you're willing to forgot he added health benefits that might come from some of the, from spending that dollar on some of those other strategies. %$* 292
now there is something very wrong with america’s health care sector, something that universal coverage will not solve. %$* 292
you can see what’s wrong, you can see what it is, i think, when you look at the veteran’s health administration. %$* 292
now i can't remember if this has come up already, if professor krugman mentioned the veteran’s health administration. %$* 292
but this is hailed by people who support universal coverage as how, as exhibiting the superiority of government when dealing with the problems presented by health care. %$* 292
i think that the va story is very important, but i don’t think it tells the story that supporters of universal, of universal coverage think that it tells. %$* 292
the va has made impressive strides, using electronic medical records, to focus on preventive care, improving quality, avoiding medical errors. %$* 292
the reason is not some inherent superiority of government, the reason is really just two features of the way the va is organized. %$* 292
they're called integration and pre-payment. %$* 292
if should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) anyone cares we can talk about what those mean later on. %$* 292
but those features are not unique to the veteran’s health administration. %$* 292
they exist in private health plans all over the country, you know them as plans like group health cooperative, kaiser permanente, and those plans are using health information technologies to reduce costs, improve quality, and reduce errors. %$* 292
now why don’t you have electronic medical, electronic medical records, like you have electronic financial records? %$* 292
why doesn't the hospital remember your medical history, your child’s medical history, your allergies, and these sorts of things? %$* 292
well, the biggest reason is america’s pursuit of universal coverage. %$* 292
medicare is america’s great experiment with universal coverage, and it’s also the largest purchaser of medical care in the nation. %$* 292
and medicare actually penalizes doctors and hospitals if they use electronic medical records to reduce costs, or to avoid medical errors. %$* 292
electronic records help avoid duplication, but medicare pays for duplication. %$* 292
so, if you adopt those, you make less money. %$* 292
health information technologies avoid, help to avoid medical errors, but medicare pays for medical errors. %$* 292
so, if you adopt those health information technologies, you lose money. %$* 292
so, providers make less money if they do these things that are in patient’s interests. %$* 292
meanwhile, supporters of universal coverage are trying to keep those private health plans that use these things from participating in medicare. %$* 292
with doesn't medicare stop should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) paying for duplication and errors? %$* 292
because government resists change. %$* 292
so, i don’t think the va success, the va success has demonstrated government’s brilliance so much as how government actually impedes the support of quality affordable health care. %$* 292
thank you. %$* 292
thank you, michael cannon. %$* 13
well, you’ve now heard all of the opening statements, and we’re at the point of being able to share with you the poll results we took among you, the audience, when you first arrived. %$* 13
and they’ll come up on the screen behind me. %$* 13
before the debate began forty-nine percent of you were for the motion, twenty-four percent against, twenty-seven percent undecided, which you know means that if you three leave right now, you’ve won. %$* 13
yeah %$* 13
i think we’re past that point. %$* 13
john stossel, art kellermann suggested that there’s a conflict between keeping people healthy and making money keeping people healthy. %$* 13
what about that? %$* 13
there are conflicts always in making a profit and delivering service to your customers. %$* 288
and you get rich if you service your customers well. %$* 288
the hospital that keeps people healthiest gets a should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) reputation for doing a good job, and that’s how capitalism works, you get rich by doing well. %$* 288
but i heard you also argue that you feel there would be much less innovation in the us system if we went, if there were not a profit motive behind development. %$* 13
totally. %$* 288
we take the benefits of the profit motive for granted all the time. %$* 288
the fact that i can go to a foreign country, stick a piece of plastic in the wall, and cash will come out. %$* 288
and i can give that card to a total stranger who doesn't even speak english, and he’ll rent me a car for the week. %$* 288
and when i get home visa or mastercard will have the accounting correct to he penny. %$* 288
but the government can't even count the votes accurately. %$* 288
and yet our instinct %$* 288
is to go to government. %$* 288
art kellermann? %$* 13
we had a lot of talking about cars earlier, and, i think everybody is familiar with the economic problems that gm is having right now, and actually i think gm’s cars are better than trabant. %$* 291
but they're carrying about five billion dollars a year in health care costs. %$* 291
several years ago the ceo at gm testified before congress and said two billion dollars out of their bottom line every year should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) was just for drugs. %$* 291
now meanwhile, pfizer, the second largest pharmaceutical company in the united states, last year reported nineteen billion dollars in profit, thirty-seven percent profit margin. %$* 291

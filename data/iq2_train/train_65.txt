and i think that when you look at the level of optimism for generation x when we were the very same age as you guys are now, it was actually equal to your level of optimism. %$* 261
optimism is not something that's lost upon the young, right? %$* 261
we expect the young to be optimistic. %$* 261
and i hope that you keep your optimism. %$* 261
david, i hope that you keep your pragmatic idealism, as you've written about. %$* 261
but the practical reality is that, as people grow older, and as their responsibilities increase, and as they do take on mortgages and have families and have additional constraints, the ability to service that optimism in every generation or over the course of history, it decreases, right? %$* 261
i hope that's not the case for millennials. %$* 261
but it's not anything special when you compare it to other generations, unfortunately. %$* 261
ah, okay. %$* 13
that's the point. %$* 13
david, in other words, your opponents are saying they've heard it before. %$* 13
well, i mean, i think you have to look at the context of the circumstances. %$* 263
you know, the hand at which generation x was dealt, and there is a parallel. %$* 263
it's actually a little bit higher among millennials than it was among generation x. but if you consider that in terms of context, as i mentioned earlier, i think that's what's really important, that you would expect in the worst job market in history, you would expect in the face of huge unemployment and the terrible economic climate, that the natural-- %$* 263
the natural tendency would be for people to be incredibly not optimistic about their own economic future. %$* 263
but what's even more interesting is that people are optimistic about their situation at the moment, not just about their future and what's ahead. %$* 263
and i think that that's really what's particularly striking about it. %$* 263
can we just talk about-- %$* 261
let me bring keith in to respond to that. %$* 13
keith, do you prefer w. keith in references or "keith." %$* 13
"keith" is good. %$* 262
okay. %$* 13
because when i first ran by you with keith, a big voice in my head said, "say w. before his name." %$* 13
and so i didn't know if i had to w. all night or not. %$* 13
there are a lot of keith campbells out there, and i've gotten hate mail for some of them for cloning keith. %$* 262
oh, you don't want that. %$* 13
all right, w. it is. %$* 13
before that, yeah. %$* 262
so, keith, respond to your opponent. %$* 13
optimism is fine. %$* 262
i'm not as big a fan. %$* 262
i'm a little more of a fan of self-control and sort of effectively moving towards goals rather than global optimism. %$* 262
i don't know if we're seeing that. %$* 262
i just-- %$* 262
i don't know. %$* 262
i don't know if there's data on our people saying, look, i'm in trouble-- %$* 262
i'm going to do x, y and z to get out of trouble, or are they-- %$* 262
are they kind of moving into something else to get away from it. %$* 262
i just don't the answer to that. %$* 262
jessica? %$* 13
i would say we are effectively moving towards goals. %$* 264
it was mentioned that millennials are putting off marriage and family, and that, in large part, is because women have flooded into the work force and have higher levels of educational attainment. %$* 264
and that's why it might seem like immaturity it you don't actually talk to millennials and look at the statistics. %$* 264
they are putting off these things not out of a sense of immaturity but because they do want all of their ducks in a row. %$* 264
they're planning for these things. %$* 264
it just-- %$* 264
that planning takes longer. %$* 264
and i don't think that that is necessarily a bad thing. %$* 264
i mean, all of the studies show that older parents are better parents. %$* 264
so i just don't see how that's a cause for alarm. %$* 264
that's a cause for celebration. %$* 264
okay. %$* 13
binta brown. %$* 13
just to talk about this context point, david, so first of all, it stinks to be young, having gone through what your generation has gone through. %$* 261
but keep in mind that not only did your generation go through all of the things your generation has gone through, but the x 'ers and the boomers and many members of the greatest generation have gone through the same. %$* 261
and some of them actually somewhat worse. %$* 261
i mean, i think our context is we were children of the cold war. %$* 261
we were children of gas crises. %$* 261
we were children who saw the walls come down, sure. %$* 261
and that set into some of our optimism. %$* 261
but i think that you can look at any point in history and say, yes, but we're extra optimistic because of-- %$* 261
look at what we've gone through. %$* 261
that argument just doesn't really sit with me, particularly as-- %$* 261
when you think about what keith is saying with optimism and what are the dangers, and thereâ€˜s a rebuttal in part to jessica. %$* 261
and i'm sorry to keep doing this to you. %$* 261
but one of the dangers with optimism is that it does fuel consumption. %$* 261
you say that your generation is more frugal, and in fact, studies shows that your generation has had the fastest increase from luxury consumption. %$* 261
i think i saw something along the lines of-- %$* 261
well, 25 percent of millennials report not having enough to cover their expenses. %$* 261
but at the same time, they've increased 33 percent in their purchases of premium fashion and services, more than any other generation. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
let's let the other side respond to that-- %$* 13
to that argument about materialism. %$* 13
let's call it. %$* 13
jessica or david. %$* 13
david, we haven't heard from you in a minute. %$* 13
well, i mean, i think the important thing to consider there is what-- %$* 263
as millennial spending patterns change, for instance, as jessica is mentioning, when people are not planning for these large payments, of course you're going to see increases in other kinds of spending. %$* 263
that should not be surprising to anyone who looks at economics, that when people are not planning to buy houses and cars and these big capital expenses that people normally go through, that you would see increased spending in other areas. %$* 263
i also think one of the interesting things about, you look at one of the-- %$* 263
in those numbers, there are two things which are kind of tricky, which is one is increased spending on people eating out and increased spending on travel. %$* 263
both of those things, if you go deeper into studies on both of those issues, show that people are engaging in those activities with friends as a way of developing communal experiences. %$* 263
and this goes to the question of thinking about community, which i think is really one of the big traits of this generation. %$* 263
this generation is finding new ways to engage community in helping them %$* 263
so can you very quickly, and in 15 seconds, list some of those ways, then i want to hear from your opponent, keith. %$* 13
well, i think the most important point i would make on that is that this is a generation that has more relationships, more strong relationships with a diverse set of people than any generation. %$* 263
quantified how? %$* 13
is that your gut, or is there-- %$* 13
no, it's in terms of the kind of access to community that any person in this generation has access to. %$* 263
okay. %$* 13
keith campbell. %$* 13
well, i think what we've traded, in a large part because it's the ability to have social networks, facebook or whatever, is we have broader social networks. %$* 262
and young people have broader social networks than people who grew up before that. %$* 262
i think there's been a tradeoff of depth to some extent because it takes time to nurture a broad network. %$* 262
but the networks are certainly broader with young people. %$* 262
i just don't think the depth is necessarily deeper. %$* 262
all right. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
let me take that question to jessica, because, jessica, a couple of times you've done a little flipping of their narrative, as you did with postponing marriage, which i'd like to come back to. %$* 13
but your opponents are saying that this notion of relationships that are online and that are broader, they're saying they're just not as good as real good old-fashioned relationships. %$* 13
and i think a lot of us understand why they say that, why there's a logic to that. %$* 13
but do you need to concede that point? %$* 13
no, absolutely. %$* 264
i mean, i will make the example of g chat. %$* 264
i talk to my friends throughout the day on g chat, the same people over and over again, the same set of four women who, if, before the advent of technology, i would have had to call them, walk over to them. %$* 264
the constant communication that we can have with our close compatriots is immeasurable. %$* 264
so, yes, we might have geographic distance or, you know, we might have these broader, you know, networks of friends. %$* 264
but i think actually it enables a closeness. %$* 264
and i think, you know, the number of close friends that people have has not demonstrably changed. %$* 264
you know, i think people say it's three people that they consider confidantes. %$* 264
and i don't think that those numbers have moved. %$* 264
are you persuaded, binta, by that? %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i-- %$* 261
listen, from my perspective, i have a huge number of friends on all various forms of social media. %$* 261
and i use that as a means of bringing myself closer to them. %$* 261
i have a much broader set of relationships. %$* 261
but what i dispute is that millennials have a more diverse set of relationships. %$* 261
why? %$* 13
well, because the studies don't show that. %$* 261
and empirical data and analysis doesn't show it either. %$* 261
again, going back to that 43 percent nonwhite number, i do not see, on college campuses, close integration between the black and hispanic populations and the white populations. %$* 261
i do not see, when i go to tech conferences, and there are a lot of young entrepreneurs around, a great integration there. %$* 261
i do not see it at social good conferences. %$* 261
i do not see it at like basically anywhere i go. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
let me take it to david burstein because he was making this. %$* 13
david, do you see something that binta is not seeing? %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i think you-- %$* 263
and where? %$* 13
i mean, she just was-- %$* 13
she just gave three concrete examples of where she's basically seeing, you know, segregation, whether self-motivated or not. %$* 13
but she's saying it's a little bit of a fantasy what you're talking about. %$* 13
well, i think you have to look at it in comparison to where that's been in the past. %$* 263
i mean, the idea that those groups you mentioned were worse 20 years ago, i think it's pretty easy to say that. %$* 263
i mean, i think you think about the-- %$* 263
one or two-- %$* 261
one or two as opposed to zero is not a real marginal improvement. %$* 261
i mean, we could go back and forth about that percentage. %$* 263
but i think the question is that today you've got a group of people who are actually able to connect around real fences of ideas, people who are able to bond together in terms of thinking about, if you were someone who is interested in a particular topic or a particular interest, your ability 20 years ago to connect with people and have a conversation about that was relatively limited. %$* 263
the ability for someone to do that today is incredibly increased. %$* 263
and i would say that the examples of the conferences that you just mentioned are examples of part of what this generation has brought about. %$* 263
you look at the attendees of those conferences and those things that both of us attend you know that the large percentage of the people there are young, people who are engaged in trying to change the world and make the world a better place. %$* 263
let me move on to something now, to keith campbell's area of expertise, which is this argument about the generation being narcissistic, that this is a clinical thing. %$* 13
no, i-- %$* 262
well-- %$* 262
well, you finish the thought if i'm wrong. %$* 13
no, i mean, we're talking about personality trait, i mean, it-- %$* 262
right, so you're saying that-- %$* 13
i don't like to-- %$* 262
i mean, if-- %$* 262
diagnostic, it's harder to make that claim. %$* 262
i don't want to - %$* 262
so what claim are you making? %$* 13
the narcissistic personality. %$* 262
so the reason i used the term "clinical" is i want to-- %$* 13
you didn't actually detail what that personality is. %$* 13
what are some of the specifics? %$* 13
well, it's having an inflated view of yourself and using relationships to regulate that. %$* 262
so if you're on facebook, it's putting an attractive photo of yourself and bragging about yourself and having more facebook connections. %$* 262
if it's in marriage you have a trophy spouse. %$* 262
so you sort of use your interpersonal relationships to bolster your self-image. %$* 262
and that's bad. %$* 13
well, it's good for you. %$* 262
i mean, it works for you. %$* 262
it doesn't work for other people. %$* 262
that's the-- %$* 262
it's a problem. %$* 262
seriously, you know, i think most people see it from inside. %$* 13
why does it not work for other people? %$* 13
what's the harm %$* 13
well, when you're being manipulated by somebody as a trophy or as a prop in their own life narrative-- %$* 262
okay. %$* 13
it becomes problematic-- %$* 262
and just to nail it before i go to the other side you're saying that this generation is characterized by that trait, there's a-- %$* 13
i'm saying the levels of narcissism have gone up about half a standard deviation which is shifting a little bit. %$* 262
okay. %$* 13
what happens at the extremes is that the extremes go up a lot. %$* 262
but the average millennial compared to the average gen xer on narcissism is not that different. %$* 262
what happens, though, is you-- %$* 262
when you shift everybody a little bit, the number of people at the extremes goes up a lot, and those are the ones that want to drive you crazy when you interview them for jobs-- %$* 262
okay. %$* 13
or go out on dates with them. %$* 262
so let me bring that to your opponents and to you, jessica grose. %$* 13
you've already said that your generation is the victim of a lot of myths, but, you know, your opponent has studied this, takes it seriously, and definitely bears you no ill will on this. %$* 13
right. %$* 264
so in any way honestly do you recognize your generation in that description? %$* 13
i don't. %$* 264
i think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the way we use social media. %$* 264
look, everyone is trying to present their best face to the world. %$* 264
we just are the first to have these tools, so, yes, maybe a pretty selfie of yourself might seem to be narcissistic but i think that that's just-- %$* 264
that's the way we move through the world. %$* 264
there is-- %$* 264
you know, studies-- %$* 264
this researcher, danah boyd, has looked at the way that teenagers and 20-somethings deal with the internet, and there is-- %$* 264
i think with older people who weren't native to it, there's more of a divide. %$* 264
but it's really just a fluid thing. %$* 264
it's a fluid thing, so you're trying to put your best face to the world virtually just as you would try to put your best face to the world in person. %$* 264
and i just think that it's not actual evidence of anything except these tools existing. %$* 264
binta, i know this wasn't your ammunition that you brought in, but what's your response to jessica on that? %$* 13
to selfies? %$* 261
yeah. %$* 13
alissa don't say anything. %$* 261
so i don't particularly understand them. %$* 261
i have a derivation of the selfie. %$* 261
i call it the "self-bomb," which is where it is not - - the point of it is not for me to look my very best but to show that a corner of myself was somewhere. %$* 261
so it'll be an eye or an eyebrow or something along those lines, but-- %$* 261
you are very, very meta here. %$* 13
yeah, yeah, yeah. %$* 261
i mean, but, look, i think that one of the things that's missing in this conversation-- %$* 261
and, you know, i-- %$* 261
all of the hair on my back raises when i hear what i have referred to as "millennial exceptionalism," because it focuses-- %$* 261
and you think you're hearing that already from the other side? %$* 13
i do. %$* 261
all right. %$* 13
define it again, "millennial exceptionalism." %$* 13
in the sense that everything is going so, so great, and the problem with it isn't to say that there aren't some things that aren't going incredibly well, but-- %$* 261
i never said-- %$* 264
i had a whole paragraph about how we've been dealt %$* 264
hang on. %$* 261
hang on. %$* 261
hang on. %$* 261
hang on. %$* 261
our turn. %$* 261
do not forget the forgotten generation. %$* 261
you know, i get concerned when i hear about "we're-- %$* 261
the greatest is we're-- %$* 261
we're doing this, we're doing this, we're doing that," because it means that we're not focusing on the underlying problems. %$* 261
and the underlying problems are the reasons why-- %$* 261
and narcissism is one thing, some of these other things that you hear in the media-- %$* 261
i think the media has done millennials a complete disservice, because they're not focusing on what the actual issues are. %$* 261
and because they're not focusing on them, our policymakers aren't doing what our policymakers ought to be doing in order to help them out. %$* 261
i'm not going to get particularly excited about things like selfies. %$* 261
you know, i've been in a couple of them myself. %$* 261
i don't think that they're particularly harmful. %$* 261
i think that's the kind of thing that, you know, as people age, they either grow out of or they keep doing it. %$* 261
but i don't think that that is the reason why millennials are going to have a harder time in the workplace. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
david, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
well, yeah. %$* 263
david burstein. %$* 13
i mean, i would also add that i think when you think about this question of narcissism, the idea that people are taking pictures of themselves is not, to me-- %$* 263
at least-- %$* 263
a particularly strong case that this is a narcissistic generation. %$* 263
if you look at the growth of camera phones, it's a pretty realistic idea that people are going to use-- %$* 263
if everybody has a phone. %$* 263
every phone has a camera. %$* 263
it's a pretty realistic assumption to i think those things are really not the best way to look at it. %$* 263
but when you actually look at the way that this issue has been looked at over time, the data about attitudes is much different than when you actually look at the behaviors. %$* 263
i think that it's hard to-- %$* 263
it's hard to argue that this is the most narcissistic generation when you say-- %$* 263
as you said, keith-- %$* 263
that this generation is volunteering at higher rates. %$* 263
i don't know how-- %$* 263
i mean, making that argument-- %$* 263
keith-- %$* 13
how can you-- %$* 13
how do those two things go together? %$* 13
well, the way i'd make the argument is that volunteering for exntrinsic reasons. %$* 262
so, it's done for college applications, or it's done because it's a requirement in high school. %$* 262
how do you know? %$* 13
well, because the rates go up in the first couple of years of college and then they drop-- %$* 262
because kids are forced to do it now. %$* 262
i don't like making that argument. %$* 262
i think-- %$* 262
i'd say, look, a culture volunteering, that's a good thing. %$* 262
i'm not going to cover it up. %$* 262
but yeah, it's not a hard argument to make, because if you see all the data going one direction, except for one data point, but-- %$* 262
when you look at-- %$* 263
just before you finish your remarks-- %$* 13
after this i'd like to start going to audience questions. %$* 13
and i want to remind you, the way it'll work-- %$* 13
if you raise your hand, a microphone will come to you. %$* 13
i need you to wait until the mic reaches you so that we can record you-- %$* 13
this for the broadcast. %$* 13
if you're with the media, we would appreciate it a lot if you would identify yourself and your organization. %$* 13
and if you'd stand up so that the cameras can see you. %$* 13
and again, please keep it to a question that's on the topic. %$* 13
go ahead, david burstein. %$* 13
i mean, i want to just sort of push back on this question of exceptionalism. %$* 263
i don't think this is the greatest generation that's ever lived. %$* 263
i think there are a lot of positive things about this generation. %$* 263
and i think what's really interesting is when you look at that-- %$* 263
and that's the study, keith, that you've looked at-- %$* 263
this idea that people saying, for instance, that they want to be famous or they want to be an important person. %$* 263
if you ask that question-- %$* 263
as it's been asked over a long period of time, 30 or 40 years ago, the only way that people were famous 30 or 40 years ago were as movie stars or as singers. %$* 263
today, there are a lot of people who are famous and important who aren't those things, who we know about and discuss in the public eye. %$* 263
david, wait, but what about this point that both you and jessica are talking about a subset of your generation? %$* 13
well, i wanted to-- %$* 264
argue back against that, which is to say, you know-- %$* 264
jessica grose. %$* 13
minorities and women have historically had a harder time in america. %$* 264
and we're arguing millennials specifically are doomed. %$* 264
and actually, things are better for minorities and women than they have been in the past. %$* 264
so, i just don't see how those are examples about how our generation specifically is doomed or having a hard time. %$* 264
certainly those are-- %$* 264
the systemic problems that i mentioned in my intro, that we need to work on fixing. %$* 264
but as we are, racially the most diverse generation already, i think that we're particularly-- %$* 264
we have more global funds. %$* 264
we have more global contacts. %$* 264
we're particularly equipped to fix these systemic problems that have plagued the united states forever, you know? %$* 264
so i just don't think that's evidence of how we specifically are doomed. %$* 264
and in the interest of getting to audience questions, can you respond in 30 seconds or-- %$* 13
i'm going to try to do this really quick. %$* 261
of the 15 percent of millennials who are black-- %$* 261
72 percent of those do not have four-year college degrees. %$* 261
32-and-a-half percent of them are unemployed. %$* 261
only 66 percent of black millennials graduated from high school. %$* 261
of the 20 percent of millennials who are-- %$* 261
but how is that worse than-- %$* 264
hang on. %$* 261
the last generation? %$* 264
it is-- %$* 261
actually, the numbers are showing declines and that it's worsening. %$* 261
you have an almost permanent underclass that's being created within your generation, according to many different analysts. %$* 261
we can shake our heads and we can say, "no," that that's not true. %$* 261
but the numbers are indicating-- %$* 261
i didn't say it wasn't true. %$* 264
i just said it's not-- %$* 264
but jessica-- %$* 13
jessica-- %$* 13
but the numbers are-- %$* 261
just let binta %$* 13
but the numbers are indicating otherwise. %$* 261
with 81 percent of hispanics, the largest cohort-- %$* 261
or soon to be the largest cohort-- %$* 261
24.2 percent are unemployed. %$* 261
same statistics, dreadful statistics. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
we hear you-- %$* 13
that are specifically affecting-- %$* 261
let's let jessica respond. %$* 13
this generation. %$* 261
i just don't think that you've-- %$* 264
jessica grose. %$* 13
i mean, you say, you know, statistics show it's worse. %$* 264
you haven't cited those statistics. %$* 264
i've never seen those statistics, that it's worse. %$* 264
i just think that that's demonstrably untrue. %$* 264
we see, you know-- %$* 264
there was a packet you were supposed to get in the mail. %$* 13
and everyone here. %$* 13
let's go to audience questions. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
and a microphone's coming from behind you on the right. %$* 13
if you can, again, tell us your name. %$* 13
and hold the mic about the distance from-- %$* 13
about a fist away from your mouth. %$* 13
that's great. %$* 13
is this-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 19
hey, i'm ella. %$* 19
this question's for jessica. %$* 19
and i love your articles, by the way. %$* 19
binta and keith made a point of optimism without substance and spending without conscientiousness, and many millennials being underemployed. %$* 19
social media is inundated by phrases such as "yolo," living in a moment, making as many friends as possible. %$* 19
you mentioned millennials using public services because they believe in sustainability. %$* 19
but it's hard to believe that most millennials will turn down a free car or studio apartment. %$* 19
do you have any further evidence that millennials actively want to follow truly sustainable lifestyles rather than not being able to afford it? %$* 19
absolutely. %$* 264
the most-- %$* 264
the millennials are the most urban generation of adults today. %$* 264
they are most like that they really want to live in cities. %$* 264
they want to live closely together. %$* 264
they want to live in close communities. %$* 264
and all of this is that-- %$* 264
and i don't think that they're moving away from not wanting to buy cars. %$* 264
i mean, part of that, yes, is financial. %$* 264
but part of that, if you look at the studies, is because they want to live in cities. %$* 264
they want to live close together. %$* 264
so i think that that's all evidence that shows that they have this commitment to living sustainably. %$* 264
and there also is evidence that they want to spend-- %$* 264
when they do spend their money, they want to spend it on experiences. %$* 264
they don't want to spend it on cars and homes. %$* 264
and so that, again, is part of this sustainable lifestyle. %$* 264
let's hear from keith campbell, your opponent. %$* 13
well, i think that the car data is interesting. %$* 262
and i didn't know that car manufacturers are really worried about that and a lot of the shared economy. %$* 262
but in terms of the environmental-- %$* 262
and support for sustainability environment, i thought that would go up in millennials, and it's gone down dramatically from the baby boomers. %$* 262
and i thought about it for-- %$* 262
did you say "dramatically from the baby boomers." %$* 13
dropped. %$* 262
since the baby boomers. %$* 13
yes. %$* 262
okay. %$* 13
and i thought about that, and i thought, well, baby boomers are the ones who gave us earth day, they're the ones who gave us the clean air act and the clean water act. %$* 262
and i'm no, you know, supporter of the baby boom-- %$* 262
no offense to half the audience. %$* 262
but they really did a lot of this environmental work, the hard work that stopped cleveland from burning and gen x and the millennials aren't doing it. %$* 262
so that-- %$* 262
we're just not seeing that in the data. %$* 262
david? %$* 13
well, i mean, i would disagree on that. %$* 263
i mean, i think that when you look at-- %$* 263
you look at that-- %$* 263
that particular indicator, you see millennials actually engaging in behaviors particularly as it relates to spending, which i think we haven't really touched on this. %$* 263
but 93 percent of people in this generation say that the sole purpose of business should not be to generate profit. %$* 263
now, i don't know about you, but if that is about something-- %$* 263
that's about, i think, a pretty big shift from where that's been in previous generations of how people feel about that. %$* 263
the question that businesses in our economy and our world should be about doing something more than simply trying to make as much money as possible i think is pretty powerful. %$* 263
you've seen a huge shift in how people spend their money. %$* 263
millennials say that they will spend money if a company does positive things for the world, which largely a big part of that is in environmental. %$* 263
so you can't necessarily look at the same indicators over time, particularly when you think about the fact that, you know, people don't have homes, they're not going to be reducing their energy costs as much as. %$* 263
so i think that you have to look at this and how the attitudes have shifted and behavior that's actually moving millions and millions of dollars because millennials are actually voting with their wallets on these really important issues. %$* 263
okay. %$* 13
let's go back to the-- %$* 13
ma'am, purple sweater-- %$* 13
jacket, sorry. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is sadie. %$* 19
i am part of the younger generation of millennials. %$* 19
i am 16. i was born in 1998. my question is directed towards the opposition-- %$* 19
i mean, i'm sorry, the for. %$* 19
the for-- %$* 13
for the motion. %$* 13
your question is-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 19
i'll explain to the radio audience as well. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
so your question is for the team that's arguing that millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
do you think there's anything we can do, like as the younger generation of millennials, people that are in their later years of high school, early years of college, do you think there's anything we could do to turn the tables in our favor, or do you think we've just been dealt a bad hand, and we can't do anything about it? %$* 18
hi, sadie. %$* 261
thanks for your question. %$* 261
oh, it's a plant, huh? %$* 13
no. %$* 261
i don't know her. %$* 261
i like millennials. %$* 261
i think that they're great folks. %$* 261
i think the millennials i know are some of the hardest working, brightest people i've ever met, but i know that they're just a subset of the population. %$* 261
in terms of what you can do, i think that one of the most important things, and the thing that if it hasn't become evident to you all, that's on my mind, is that i'm worried about social exclusion, particularly when you have such a large percentage of millennials who are diverse. %$* 261
and i'm also worried about stress management. %$* 261
and these things actually go hand in hand because what the recent pew foundation study showed, which has been cited several times tonight by myself as well as by the other side, is that with such a large percentage of diverse people, larger than we've had in any other time, first of all, there's some people who are very, very concerned about decreasing trust in society. %$* 261
and trust is really important because only when we trust one another-- %$* 261
binta, binta, let me just interrupt you-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 261
because her-- %$* 13
sadie's question was really, is there anything that this generation can do? %$* 13
and if your answer is yes, then you lose the debate. %$* 13
well, no. %$* 261
i don't-- %$* 261
i disagree. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
you disagree. %$* 13
i disagree because my purpose here tonight is not for us to be winners or losers. %$* 261
my purpose here tonight is to remind people as to why, as things stand today, millennials don't have a chance, right? %$* 261
so if you want to change that tide, which is something that we are all here responsible for doing, because we're all complicit in the mess that's been made. %$* 261
one of the things is by reaching out to people who aren't like you. %$* 261
another of the things is protesting the teasing that occurs and cyber bullying that occurs that is affecting your generation and leading to increased suicide rates, things like that, you know, on our friend basis i think you can do. %$* 261
and then the last thing i would say you could do is you could urge your parents and policy makers to put in place responsible policies that will reverse the chances you have currently today. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to go to another question. %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i'll give you the response, but i don't think it was more of a on point so much. %$* 13
sir, right down in front here. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
hey, my name is tom. %$* 18
i write for a website called flavorwire. %$* 18
my question is for keith. %$* 18
you seem to have written an entire book based on this premise that narcissism has risen. %$* 18
and the closest we got to an actual quantification of that claim was something you said about, you know, half a standard deviation or something. %$* 18
so i'm just interested in how you actually quantify narcissism and how you go about justifying this claim. %$* 18
you know, can you put that-- %$* 13
it's-- %$* 13
i just would rather that-- %$* 13
i would prefer if you could phrase the question in a way that relates to whether we can help the audience decide whether the generation is doomed or not as opposed to challenging his credentials. %$* 13
i'm not challenging his credentials i'm-- %$* 18
all right, challenging his %$* 13
as to how one quantifies narcissism. %$* 18
so you're asking-- %$* 13
if you were to say, so what are the numbers that support the claim that-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
i'd be fascinated to know. %$* 18
can you be very brief? %$* 13
because we have no way to fact check everything you're going to tell us. %$* 13
oh, perfect. %$* 262
he can go with anything. %$* 262
it's a very long answer to that because the thing about narcissism is itâ€™ssomething that affects individuals and something that exists as a cultural phenomenon. %$* 262
and there are different ways to quantify both. %$* 262
individuals, you can look at scores on tests. %$* 262
there's also a giant study out of nih looking at symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder that found people in their 20s, the lifetime rates were about 1 in 11, about 1 in 3 for people in their 60s, or 1 in 30, excuse me. %$* 262
so there's-- %$* 262
and then there's other personality data that line up with that. %$* 262
so there're several data sets that show that general pattern of inflating self. %$* 262
you know what? %$* 13
i'm going to let you ask that question because i think it's relevant, but we need the mic to be with you again so the audience can hear it. %$* 13
but make it quickly. %$* 13
what i asked, is that not something that would change over time for any generation, so somebody in a previous generation who is at the stage that millennials are at now, would they not show the same symptoms of narcissism? %$* 18
yeah. %$* 262
it's a really interesting question, is it's culture changing and the millennials sort of hit-- %$* 262
getting most of it. %$* 262
so with something like facebook, well, the millennials did it more than anybody, but now, you know, my mom's on facebook. %$* 262
is she putting up the best picture of herself? %$* 13
right. %$* 262
no. %$* 262
actually, now the millennials arenâ€™t going to be on it pretty soon. %$* 262
they're going to be on instagram. %$* 262

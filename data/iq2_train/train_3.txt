proponents of tonight’s motion will say that president obama is alienating our allies. %$* 1
he has snubbed the british and distanced himself from the israelis. %$* 1
india feels it is taking a back seat to cozier relations with china. %$* 1
the poles and czechs are troubled that we cancelled long-planned, missile defense installations, presumably in the interests of better relations with russia. %$* 1
obama has committed vast american military resources to shoring up the corrupt karzai government in afghanistan, but hasn’t allocated a single dollar of the stimulus package to defense spending. %$* 1
and finally, his administration wasted a year on diplomacy with iran. %$* 1
we are finally pushing a sanctions regime which will, at best, be watered down by the russians and chinese. %$* 1
whatever the rhetoric, we seem to be acquiescing to an iranian nuclear bomb. %$* 1
the actions of his administration accommodate our adversaries by respecting their domestic political institutions and their regional hegemony. %$* 1
in the words of historian robert kagan, “instead of trying to reverse the decline of american power, they are reorienting american foreign policy to adjust to it.” the counter argument is that the substance of obama’s policy simply represents a new realism in foreign affairs. %$* 1
it is less ideological and more pragmatic. %$* 1
his tone is conciliatory, a sharp departure from the perceived arrogance and unilateralism of his predecessor, and has generally improved america’s image abroad. %$* 1
he may not have made tangible progress on israel and palestine; but neither has any president. %$* 1
his iranian policy has at least convinced the u.n.security council that stronger sanctions are required. %$* 1
in pakistan, we have stepped up the predator war, and gained greater co- operation from the government there. %$* 1
much of the al qaeda leadership is destroyed and the taliban has suffered serious setbacks. %$* 1
most important, obama has restored confidence in our economic outlook, without which businesses would not be investing, or consumers spending, or markets rallying. %$* 1
the collapsing economy he inherited surely would have spelled america’s decline. %$* 1
which viewpoint will prevail tonight? %$* 1
an exceptional panel, who john donvan will be introducing to you next, will help you decide. %$* 1
john, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
and i just want to point out that this is the final chapter, the final debate of the 4th series of intelligence squared u.s. which was founded by robert rosenkranz who made all this possible and on this occasion, the conclusion of the fourth season, a round of applause. %$* 13
welcome to another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news and, once again, i have the pleasure of serving as moderator as the four debaters as you see sharing the stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
two against two. %$* 13
we'll be debating this motion: “obama's foreign policy spells america's decline.” now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it will have winners and losers, you, in our audience, and you're one of our largest. %$* 13
this is a sellout for this debate. %$* 13
you will be serving as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has concluded, you will have been asked twice, both once before and once afterwards to vote on this motion where you stand. %$* 13
obama's foreign policy spells america's decline. %$* 13
at the end of the debate, the team that has changed most minds over the course of the argument will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
there is a key pad to the right of your seating position. %$* 13
if you agree with our motion, “obama's foreign policy spells america's decline,” if you're with the for team press number one. %$* 13
if you're against the motion, press number two, and if you are undecided at this point, press number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it and the system will lock in the last of your votes. %$* 13
and i'll have the reports of that fairly shortly. %$* 13
we're going to have opening statements first, and after that i'll be able to report the preliminary results. %$* 13
so on to the debate. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn, they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
i would like to begin by introducing our first debater for the motion, obama's foreign policy spells america's decline. %$* 13
dan senor, i first met when he was serving as spokesman for the coalition for provisional authority in iraq. %$* 13
he has a lifelong and keen interest in foreign policy. %$* 13
in that case he put his money where his mouth was. %$* 13
it was not a safe assignment at all. %$* 13
he has also recently been named as a putative candidate for senate from new york state, but you have shelved that for the time being? %$* 13
i have. %$* 142
i hope you won't hold it against me. %$* 142
no. %$* 13
if you're interested in foreign policy, it worked out for hillary clinton. %$* 13
i will take that as a quasi endorsement? %$* 142
dan senor. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 142
thank you, john. %$* 142
and thank you, bob, for hosting this. %$* 142
it's an honor to be here with bernard-henri lévy and general clark and mort zuckerman. %$* 142
one caveat before i make my presentation. %$* 142
i'm not here tonight to issue a sweeping critique of every decision of president obama's foreign policy. %$* 142
in fact, there are some that i have been quite supportive of, quite publicly supportive of. %$* 142
i thought it was incredibly courageous of president obama to take on his own political base and commit to doubling down our troops in afghanistan. %$* 142
effectively under his presence, he will have doubled our troop levels. %$* 142
maintain the commitment, the agreement in iraq between prime minister maliki and president bush, and our presence there despite having campaigned against it, vigorously during the 2008 presidential campaign. %$* 142
nor will i issue a sweeping defense of the foreign policy decisions of president obama's predecessor. %$* 142
there were some decisions that president bush made that i was very supportive of, and some that i have been critical of. %$* 142
what i'm here to do tonight is try to focus this question along with my friend mort here who comes at this issue, by the way, from different perspectives. %$* 142
he was a supporter of-- %$* 142
public supporter of president obama. %$* 142
i was not. %$* 142
but we both have deep concerns about america's power in world affairs today: america's status in world affairs today. %$* 142
and whenever there has been a prospect of american decline as we think there is today, the-- %$* 142
one of the shock absorbers, if you will, to prevent that decline or at least slow it down, has been an enlightened understanding among americans about america's role in the world, about american power. %$* 142
and the secret is not so-- %$* 142
not so secretive secret, is it's not just about american power, sort of an enlightened understanding of american power. %$* 142
it's about america's part of a liberal international order, about america as a builder of a democratic world order. %$* 142
and you have seen these principles articulated, the notion that america helps to turn adversaries, whether there are autocratic regimes, totalitarian regimes, help them transition to democracies. %$* 142
you've seen this throughout american history. %$* 142
it's a bipartisan post world war ii at least, bipartisan foreign policy commitment dating back to truman and acheson after world war ii where they articulated certain principles. %$* 142
america will stand by democratic allies around the world no matter what. %$* 142
america will stand by dissidents fighting for their freedom in human rights around the world no matter what. %$* 142
america will consult with its allies before it panders to its adversaries no matter what. %$* 142
and america will have a defense budget and military budget, not only to defend its own borders but to back up those principles and stand by its friends. %$* 142
and that is what i'm concerned about. %$* 142
because you are seeing a realignment in american foreign policy today that backs away from those principles. %$* 142
those principles are not republican principles, they're not democratic principles. %$* 142
as i said, you can look at harry truman, you can look at john f.kennedy, america will bear any burden, pay any price to back up those principles. %$* 142
president clinton, who under general clark's superb leadership in the balkans intervened to stop genocide in the heart of central europe, in the spirit of human rights, in the spirit of helping out allies. %$* 142
and put american prestige on the line, by the way, not only american lives and resources but american prestige because he did it without u.n. support. %$* 142
president clinton enlarged nato, was willing to bring central and eastern european powers into nato, and not let russia's ambition for hegemony in the region hold those countries hostage. %$* 142
this is the spirit you've seen throughout our foreign policy transcending party lines have been exceptions, obviously, the carter years, part of the kissinger years, and today. %$* 142
today it's more than just a flare-up. %$* 142
today it's a realignment in u.s.foreign policy. %$* 142
you are seeing a strategic decision by this administration to basically send a message to our friends and allies around the world that they can't count on us for very good reason-- %$* 142
the administration would argue, because we're in an effort to reach out to new quote unquote friends. %$* 142
we're trying to turn over adversaries. %$* 142
in so doing, we may have to compromise our historic friendships. %$* 142
look at the-- %$* 142
this is just not an abstract discussion. %$* 142
you just look at where we are in the world today. %$* 142
iran is closer to having a nuclear bomb today than it was a year ago. %$* 142
this isn't hyperbole, this is a fact. %$* 142
despite pleadings from our friends and allies in moderate sunni regimes in the arab world and leaders in israel. %$* 142
this is a fact. %$* 142
leaders in eastern and central europe were completely off guard when president obama announced a unilateral revoking of our missile defense agreement in the czech republic in poland just a few months ago, all in an effort to reach out to medvedev and putin in russia. %$* 142
lech walesa who personifies the appreciation and gratitude that millions of people around the world feel for america standing by the principles i spoke about earlier, said after obama announced that decision after his administration announced that decision, he said this just shows you, you can't count on the americans. %$* 142
lech walesa. %$* 142
nicholas sarkozy, the president of france, has called the president's foreign policy naive. %$* 142
and in the u.k. where they talk about the symbol of a special relationship, the u.s. has had a unique relationship with the u.k. going back to churchill and fdr, and certainly in the past 30 years that special relationship between reagan and thatcher, president george w. bush and thatcher, president george w. bush and john major, clinton and tony blair, and president george w. bush and tony blair. %$* 142
and yet an open discussion in london, the special relationship between the u.k.and the u.s.is in jeopardy. %$* 142
gordon brown, former prime minister gordon brown, had made five requests, five requests to have a one on one meeting with president obama and couldn't get them to answer the phone. %$* 142
he wanted to meet at the un, he wanted to meet at the g 20.enormously embarrassing to the brits. %$* 142
and secretary clinton, when she was in argentina in march, she called on the british to reopen negotiations with argentina over the falklands, a wound that was in the process of healing 30 years ago and she ripped that scab off. %$* 142
a country-- %$* 142
to do this to the u.k., a country that has shed so much blood in its alliance with america and today has 10,000 troops in afghanistan serving with us. %$* 142
so i would simply say that american alliances are in major jeopardy around the world. %$* 142
i think the message has been clear over the last 15 or 16 months that it’s a darn good time to be an adversary of america and it’s a pretty crummy time to be a friend and historic ally of america. %$* 142
and the moment our historic alliances and friendships believe that that they cannot count on america and its fidelity to the principles of truman and acheson, america truly will be in decline. %$* 142
thank you, dan senor. %$* 13
our motion is obama’s foreign policy spells america’s decline and speaking first against the motion, wesley clark. %$* 13
you just heard him complimented by his opponent for his service leading nato forces in the operations in bosnia. %$* 13
he’s the former nato supreme allied commander, europe. %$* 13
again, a lifelong public servant who made a very credible run for president in 2004, actually winning primaries along the way. %$* 13
although general, it occurs to me that had you won, these guys might be blaming you for america’s decline right now, so maybe it worked out. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, wesley clark. %$* 13
john, thanks for that introduction. %$* 143
i’d like to be up here debating my own foreign policy, but that isn’t the debate. %$* 143
but this is a very, very important issue. %$* 143
and i’m very honored to be here with dan and with mort and with bernard. %$* 143
and thank you very much for moderating and thanks to all of you for being here. %$* 143
and for those of you who did support and donate to my presidential campaign, i thank you for that too. %$* 143
i was very concerned about american foreign policy in 2002 and 2003.and i think my concerns at the time were warranted. %$* 143
i knew that going into the war in iraq was a mistake. %$* 143
so did barack obama. %$* 143
we couldn’t stop the administration from going in. %$* 143
i testified in front of congress. %$* 143
i warned-- %$* 143
of course we knew our armed forces were going to do great. %$* 143
why not? %$* 143
we’ve been practicing and building for it for years and years and years. %$* 143
it’s the war that everyone expected to fight. %$* 143
it was like, why is it taking us so long? %$* 143
so we went in there and just as we expected in three weeks or less, we were in baghdad and baghdad fell and that was the end of it and the troubles began. %$* 143
the truth is, when we’re talking about american foreign policy, it didn’t begin on the 21st of january, 2009.and so i want to establish three things tonight. %$* 143
first, that barack obama began in a deep hole. %$* 143
and the first rule of when you’re in a deep hole is stop digging and start getting out of it. %$* 143
the second thing is i think he’s doing a lot of things right, and third i want to address some of the things that dan brought up here. %$* 143
so first of all, the deep hole. %$* 143
i don’t think there’s been any period in american foreign policy and domestic policy where we’ve seen so many crises and difficulties. %$* 143
it started with 9/11 when the administration basically ignored the experience of the clinton administration, didn’t pay enough attention to terrorism and we got clobbered. %$* 143
it then went into a war in afghanistan that didn’t target the correct enemy, that was just a scattering of bombs. %$* 143
osama bin laden was there; the military was never told to get him and he went to pakistan. %$* 143
then we withdrew our intelligence assets; we prepared to go to war with iraq which for a variety of reasons that have never been fully explained, the administration was insistent on doing. %$* 143
that easy victory turned into a drawn-out, very expensive, very difficult insurgency. %$* 143
in the process, we lost friends and allies as they all fell by the wayside except for a couple of great allies like britain and italy. %$* 143
but the europeans rightly had questions about how necessary this war was. %$* 143
we were no more in the deep insurgency then katrina came and hugo chavez and others had to offer assistance to the united states because we couldn’t seem to take care of our own problems in katrina. %$* 143
and then followed up by the financial collapse of 2007, 2008 which really put us in a hole as a nation that was in decline. %$* 143
so barack obama had a very tough road to hoe. %$* 143
i think he’s doing a lot of things right. %$* 143
he’s starting by trying to make more friends and fewer enemies in the world, so he’s reached out a hand of friendship to the islamic world. %$* 143
his speech in cairo was incredibly well received. %$* 143
he was nominated and received a nobel peace prize based on the atmosphere he projected and that atmosphere goes a long way in international relations. %$* 143
he's kept our military strong. %$* 143
he has doubled down in afghanistan. %$* 143
he's made it clear that there will be no easy path for terrorists in the united states. %$* 143
he stayed very tough on homeland security. %$* 143
he stuck with the commitments america made in iraq. %$* 143
he's got a team in the pentagon and elsewhere that will follow through on the effective policies of the previous administration and modify them where necessary. %$* 143
so i think he's doing a lot of things right in terms of keeping us safe. %$* 143
i think in terms of his work with nato, they've made very strong presentations at the nato summit. %$* 143
we brought in new members in nato, albania and croatia, helping to fill out the balkans and bring stability into that region. %$* 143
and we've worked on other areas like trying to open up burma. %$* 143
he's broadened the dialogue so that when we go to the asia pacific economic groups and oceon and talk over there, we're not just talking about pursuing terrorists. %$* 143
we're talking about all the other things that are important for us. %$* 143
and he's taken a major role in international economic affairs. %$* 143
and really, there is nothing more important for america at this point after you keep america safe than to rebuild this economy and to work with our friends and allies around the world to do that. %$* 143
and he's doing all of that. %$* 143
as far as iran is concerned, and here i want to turn to the third point, let's talk about iran. %$* 143
because of going into iraq, the bush administration was never able to bring moral force or intelligence to bear on iran. %$* 143
in fact, there was an erroneous intelligence report in 2007 that said they'd given up their nuclear program. %$* 143
so let's give the president time to sort of get traction in world affairs. %$* 143
he's had it. %$* 143
he's brought consensus to bear in the united nations that iran is not complying. %$* 143
all options are on the table. %$* 143
that chapter is not over by a long shot, i would predict. %$* 143
as far as missile defense is concerned, there is a better way to do it. %$* 143
that's a missile defense that we have right now on our navy ships that can intercept mid course. %$* 143
we may need to go back to europe at a later time when iranians deploy an inner continental ballistic missile, but they're a long way from having it right now. %$* 143
inside eastern europe, the policy of putting the missile interceptors and the radars on the ground had adherence. %$* 143
it also had opponents. %$* 143
and what barack obama has done is focused on the essential element which is the rationale for putting those interceptors in place and the radar in place. %$* 143
that was to deter and reassure vis-a-vis iran. %$* 143
and that's exactly what the policy he announced will do. %$* 143
our navy can do those intercepts. %$* 143
we do have that capability. %$* 143
it will be-- %$* 143
much more effective against iran than the system that was being placed in the czech republic and poland. %$* 143
i can't comment on what president sarkozy said about barack obama's naivety. %$* 143
i'll leave those kinds of personal comments aside. %$* 143
but i think what you do have in the president is a man who is experienced in the world, a man who looks at the other side as well as what his own feelings are, someone who's running a pragmatic non-ideological policy, someone who's shown he's tough. %$* 143
he's hard headed. %$* 143
he means what he says. %$* 143
he's going to take america and lead us forward. %$* 143
i think you have to vote no to the idea that president barack obama's foreign policy spells america's decline. %$* 143
that's a no. %$* 143
thank you. %$* 143
thank you, wesley clark. %$* 13
we're halfway the opening statements portion of this debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news serving as moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters; two teams of two who are fighting it out over this motion: “obama's foreign policy spells america's decline.” you have heard the first two debaters. %$* 13
now, on to the third. %$* 13
i would like to introduce mort zuckerman who is chairman and editor in chief of u.s.news and world report, and publisher of the new york daily news, and i know that you're wounded tonight. %$* 13
do you prefer to sit or - - we appreciate that in pain and with a cane, you made it here. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
if you thought you were in pain before i spoke, wait until you see what it's going to be like after i speak. %$* 144
good evening. %$* 144
i want to share with the other speakers the measure of being a part of this wonderful group and to speak to this audience. %$* 144
let me just say when president obama came into office, it was really a quiet sigh of relief around the world. %$* 144
he wasn't george bush. %$* 144
the expectations-- %$* 144
no, i don't mean that. %$* 144
i think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of american leadership at that point. %$* 144
and the expectations about president obama were exceedingly high. %$* 144
now, any president of the united states really inherits a great legacy. %$* 144
we stand at the top of the power ladder. %$* 144
we are not a dominant power but we're the leading power. %$* 144
we're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations. %$* 144
most countries distrust the united states less than they distrust one another. %$* 144
so they look for washington-- %$* 144
to washington for leadership. %$* 144
and they look for washington to support them against regional opponents and other threats. %$* 144
they know they cannot solve most of these problems without the united states. %$* 144
and they need our leadership in the most severe and serious way. %$* 144
now, my sense, however, is that president obama on this level is uncomfortable with this role for the united states. %$* 144
he seems to be uncomfortable in leading a lot of other nations. %$* 144
and almost feels that there is nothing special about america's role in the world. %$* 144
what you have, it seems to me, is too much well intentioned belief in the power of rhetoric, good will, and too little appreciation of reality. %$* 144
the former president of the council of foreign relations, les gelb put it, there is the impression that obama confuses speeches with policies. %$* 144
now, foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personal political circumstances of those we are dealing with. %$* 144
and this is where i think we have a real problem. %$* 144
because there is, i think, a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether or not they have misjudged the man. %$* 144
in the middle east they always talk about the following. %$* 144
there are two chess games that are always being played in the middle east. %$* 144
one is the chess board that you see on top of the table. %$* 144
the other is the chess board that is below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game. %$* 144
and the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play the game and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is really an erosion of confidence in the united states and limitation therefore on what we can accomplish. %$* 144
and it also has contributed to a growing perception that obama's management of american power is almost amateurish. %$* 144
he tends to speak as a teacher rather than as a leader. %$* 144
now, in meetings with many of the leaders of the arab world, particularly the sunni leaders, they fear an expansionist iran proceeding with full speed ahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediate range missiles. %$* 144
i will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an arab country put it to me. %$* 144
when you remember obama said if people extend a hand to shake our hands instead of a fist, we will shake that hand. %$* 144
he says the problem with iran is you can't deal with it by shaking their hand. %$* 144
you have to deal with them by showing that your capable of exercising the fist. %$* 144
and that is what-- %$* 144
it is that understanding and that understanding of the culture, not just in the middle east, but in many parts of the world that is missing. %$* 144
and what you have, you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in iraq. %$* 144
and there is no sense, for example, when they had the uprising on the streets of iran, that we were there with them, that we were on, as fouad ajami put it, on freedom's side. %$* 144
now, the question is, is iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience as american weakness and the lack of real willpower? %$* 144
well, as long as the arab foreign-- %$* 144
the arab foreign ministers put it the following one. %$* 144
one of them said-- %$* 144
now, this is a quote. %$* 144
he said they are hopelessly naive. %$* 144
the americans are hopelessly naive. %$* 144
and they-- %$* 144
in that part of the world, naivety is not just naivety. %$* 144
it is seen as weakness as it really gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders are made of. %$* 144
and that is the feeling that they have about america these days. %$* 144
now, this is what french president sarkozy was referring to. %$* 144
in fairness to what we said. %$* 144
obama basically comes and gives a speech about wouldn't it be nice if the world did not have any nuclear weapons. %$* 144
yes, it would. %$* 144
he basically said this is almost an alternative universe. %$* 144
it's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth. %$* 144
they cannot be he said and sarkozy pointed out, that there are two countries he said, that’s in the meeting in which the president was in the audience. %$* 144
he said there are two countries right in front of us doing the exact opposite, referring of course to north korea and iran, an iran that had ignored five u.n.resolutions on this issue alone. %$* 144
in the later diplomatic push, vis-a- vis iran and north korea: that yielded nothing. %$* 144
sarkozy said we are right to talk about the future as the president was referring, but we also have to worry about the present and here you have these two countries, members of the united nations who are pursuing exactly the policies that we find inimical. %$* 144
we’ve got to find some way to deal with the present he said and not with the future. %$* 144
in fact he pointed to the president-- %$* 144
looked at the president and said, this is not the real world that you are talking about; this is the virtual world. %$* 144
now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the united nations in the audience and the french president says to an american president, you have to admit that the world is upside down when the french president sounds much stronger than the american one. %$* 144
and this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here. %$* 144
now, it is, i can add to those things you’ve heard the references to when obama withdrew the promises of abm defenses, two countries in central europe, perhaps thinking that he might appease russia into abrogating their patronage of iran’s nuclear ambitions. %$* 144
well frankly this has obviously failed and now in central europe, there is a fear that the united states may no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. %$* 144
my time is up-- %$* 144
well let me just, if i may just close. %$* 144
i just want to say one thing about this. %$* 144
what we are talking about here is an ability to play the game and an understand of how to play to the game and play the game well and effectively. %$* 144
that is what i see us lacking in the obama administration and why it makes me feel that we are on the decline. %$* 144
thank you very much. %$* 13
well let me just, if i may just close. %$* 144
i just want to say one thing about this. %$* 144
what we are talking about here is an ability to play the game and an understand of how to play to the game and play the game well and effectively. %$* 144
that is what i see us lacking in the obama administration and why it makes me feel that we are on the decline. %$* 144
thank you, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
our motion is, “obama’s foreign policy spells america’s decline.” and our final speaker i’m very pleased to say is a european, given that we are speaking about foreign policy, i’d like to introduce bernard-henri lévy, french philosopher and public intellectual. %$* 13
i would love to see the business card that says philosopher and public intellectual. %$* 13
he has written extensively about the united states, very often in positive tones and he is here tonight to argue against the motion that obama’s foreign policy spells america’s decline. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, bernard-henri lévy. %$* 13
yes, absolutely against for sure. %$* 145
in this debate i will have a big handicap and a little advantage. %$* 145
the big handicap is unfortunately my terrible and pitiful english. %$* 145
i must apologize. %$* 145
and my little advantage is to look at this topic, at this motion from outside and maybe from a slightly objective point of view. %$* 145
when you speak about obama’s foreign policy spelling america’s decline, what do people think? %$* 145
number one, they speak about the weakness, the supposed weakness of barack obama, his practice of compromise, his taste for compromise and so on. %$* 145
i think it is not true. %$* 145
i think that obama, as i see him from outside, tries to compromise, does-- %$* 145
makes the most he can do with compromise and when it does not work, for example, when syria proves to be continuing to bring some heavy weapons to a fascist party which is hezbollah, then sanctions in strength. %$* 145
barack obama, as did any of your last presidents, believes in strengths but he believes in strengths as the great strategies, as sun tzu, machiavelli, holding the fire and not this zero degree of strengths which is just jacksonian politics. %$* 145
the second thing which is meant when one speaks about barack obama spelling the decline of america alludes to the fact that obama would not be supportive enough to his natural allies and too much supportive for his enemies. %$* 145
i don’t think so at all. %$* 145
i just believe that he does what the foreign policy must do. %$* 145
foreign policy by definition speaks with enemies, speaks with ugly leaders, and in the respect of the natural alliance. %$* 145
i happen to be one of the europeans who have had the chance to speak with barack obama about israel six years ago before he was even candidate. %$* 145
my feeling again from outside is that to say that barack obama would not be supportive enough to the old natural allies of america is just untrue. %$* 145
number three: the reproach, which is criticized, which is done to barack obama is that he speaks a lot and acts not enough. %$* 145
i'm not sure that he acts so little. %$* 145
i have one personal experience, rather recent, in afghanistan. %$* 145
i was in the uzbin valley with some of your guys embedded in an american unit. %$* 145
i saw that the strategy of general mcchrystal endorsed by your president is not so bad and is producing some real results on the ground. %$* 145
but this be put aside, it is true the barack obama speaks, speaks a lot, but why does he speak so much? %$* 145
he speaks because he knows that foreign policy has changed its stage, that the new stage of foreign policy has new actors. %$* 145
and especially one new actor: not only the not only sarkozy, not only the big leader of the world or the little leaders of the world, but the public opinion. %$* 145
barack obama understood that to have a real foreign policy supposes to address directly the world public opinion, that it is the only chance to achieve some real results as he did, for example, with the speech of cairo. %$* 145
the other criticism which is done to barack obama is to admit too easily the rise of new powers and the subsequent diminution of the american influence: power of russia, power of china, and so on. %$* 145
but again, who is really spelling the decline? %$* 145
those who still believe in the world of yesterday, frozen in old schemes, or those who try to understand the world which is coming with a new lens, with new glasses, and trying to maintain the rank of america in this new world? %$* 145
barack obama just knows that china is becoming a big power. %$* 145
he just knows that russia is an actor de-freezing itself from the old stalinist era. %$* 145
he knows that he has to deal with that and he does. %$* 145
and the last reproach which is done to him is about exceptionalism. %$* 145
i read that barack obama is getting rid of this old american creed which is exceptionalism. %$* 145
and why? %$* 145
because he apologized for abu ghraib, for guantanamo, for torture, and so on. %$* 145
i believe the contrary. %$* 145
i believe that only dictators never apologize. %$* 145
and i believe that when you apologize, it means that you believe in your creed, that you believe in your values, and you believe in their superiority. %$* 145
barack obama more than ever believes in the house shining on the hill and that's why i vote no on the motion, he does not spell american decline. %$* 145
thank you, bernard-henri lévy. %$* 13
that concludes opening statements for this intelligence u.s.squared debate. %$* 13
here is where we are. %$* 13
we are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly, and we also bring in you, the members of the audience, to ask questions. %$* 13
the way that we'll do that, is when we come to the questions is for you to raise your hand and i find you. %$* 13
there will be ushers with microphones. %$* 13
they'll bring a microphone to you. %$* 13
we'll ask you to stand. %$* 13
if you're a member of the news media or have any other relevant or interesting affiliation, we'd appreciate it if you'd share that with us. %$* 13
and when you get the microphone, if you can hold it about that far, distance away from your mouth, so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you. %$* 13
before the debate, we had you vote on where you stood on our motion, “obama's foreign policy spells america's decline,” and we now have the results of that vote. %$* 13
before the debate, this is where it stands, 23% of you are for the motion, 45% are against the motion, and 32% are undecided. %$* 13
that's where it stands now at the end of the debate we'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly. %$* 13
we have here at the skirball center for the performing arts in new york university, the teams of two, dan senor and mortimer zuckerman who are arguing that obama's foreign policy spells america's decline. %$* 13
they have made the argument that president obama has snubbed old friends. %$* 13
on the other side, wesley clark and bernard-henri lévy, who have made the argument that president obama is setting out to make new friends. %$* 13
what we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of president obama is the matter of respect. %$* 13
does the world respect him? %$* 13
i want to put that question to both sides briefly. %$* 13
first to the team for the motion. %$* 13
is president obama respected? %$* 13
and is it the right kind of respect? %$* 13
mortimer zuckerman. %$* 13
i'm going to speak with a french accent, if you don't mind. %$* 144
this is unfair. %$* 145
i will quote a major asian leader who said-- %$* 144
very well-known asian leader who said in the world of asia, in the leadership of asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world-- %$* 144
we are concerned that obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends. %$* 144
now, i'm not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world. %$* 144
in terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, i would ask you to think, if i may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence? %$* 144
do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because obama gives speeches? %$* 144
so you do not think he's respected? %$* 13
no, i think he is respected. %$* 144
i don't think he is effective. %$* 144
to the other side. %$* 13
wesley clark. %$* 13
i think he is effective. %$* 143
i think what he's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and america's values, and his vision. %$* 143
and i think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that. %$* 143
he's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the united states which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face. %$* 143
so for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, mort. %$* 143
and he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in washington. %$* 143
people came. %$* 143
and it was important. %$* 143
and it was a private meeting. %$* 143
and they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the united states of america. %$* 143
i think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists. %$* 143
and that's the problem barack obama is focusing on. %$* 143
so i give him high marks for the summit. %$* 143
i give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons. %$* 143
and i give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging. %$* 143
dan senor. %$* 13
yeah, i would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate. %$* 142
i mean iran, according to iaea, according to our own intelligence community iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years. %$* 142
that’s really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.we still don’t have a security council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of president obama around the world. %$* 142
the chinese won’t get on board, the russians won’t get on board. %$* 142
the iranians basically say and the ieae says, that iran has mastered something like 3000 centrifuges, enough to actually build a weapon. %$* 142
i mean, speeches and personal biography and personal charisma are wonderful, they’re nice; i think people around the world like us. %$* 142
i think they’re just limited commodities in foreign affairs. %$* 142
nations-- %$* 142
you’re saying the goodwill does not translate. %$* 13
nations don’t make major decisions about their security because president obama gives a nice speech. %$* 142
they do what’s in their interests. %$* 142
so i guess i would ask either of you, show me one example, one, that has generated any benefit in response to obama’s wonderful speeches. %$* 142
what have we gotten? %$* 142
i mean the ultimate measure is iran’s about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress. %$* 142
bernard? %$* 13
i give you two examples. %$* 145
barack obama is your first president and first leader of high rank that has said that the risk of the terrorist group having a nuclear device in their hands will happen, could happen in pakistan. %$* 145
he is the first one who has designated pakistan as a major problem. %$* 145
you had a president who said it was iraq and who looked for the nuclear weapons with a lamp torch. %$* 145
barack obama said that the problem is in pakistan. %$* 145
this changed all the deal inside pakistani power, inside the isi, and more importantly inside civil society in pakistan. %$* 145
example number two. %$* 145
wait, while we hold that because i want to %$* 13
two examples. %$* 145
because number one, that is your big get, is that obama said that pakistan poses a threat? %$* 142
one of the rationales that bush used for going into afghanistan is that pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands. %$* 142
your big get is that obama basically confirmed something we all know. %$* 142
let’s here number two, example number two. %$* 13
president bush during his 8 years delivered huge, unconditional, untied aid to pakistan government without any conditions regarding the topic we are speaking today. %$* 145
barack obama has changed that and this is not speech, this is act. %$* 145
number two: the speech of cairo. %$* 145
you know, the best way to help your friends is to disarm the enemies of your friends and the speech of cairo had one concrete effect, which is to comfort the moderates in islam, to isolate the people of al-qaeda, the fanatics and the integrists, to divide the muslim world, and this is-- %$* 145
which has concrete effects on the ground, i can tell you. %$* 145
i know pakistan; i went in algeria; i went in afghanistan, the new strategy of mcchrystal for example, today consisting of isolating the taliban inside the civil society, demonstrating to the people in afghanistan that their interest is not to protect the taliban. %$* 145
hamas is stronger today than it was a year ago. %$* 142
syria’s announced or it’s been reported that syria’s sending katyusha rockets to lebanon to give to hezbollah and more sophisticated weaponry than that. %$* 142
i mean, iran as i said is nowhere near slowing down their nuclear weaponization program. %$* 142
exact-- %$* 142
so it was a great speech; it was very moving, and it was a poetic. %$* 142
dan, what bernard is saying is that its concrete effect was to tell the moderates out there we are with you. %$* 13

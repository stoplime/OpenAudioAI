hi. %$* 18
my name is jeff roberts. %$* 18
for the yes side, paul you wanted to reassure us we're pointing to existing eu press law that, you know, there's nothing new here, everything's legal, but as a north american journalist, european press law scares the hell out of me, particularly u.k. libel law, which has been used by the elite to chill journalists and average people, so perhaps eric posner you'd like to address that. %$* 18
can you rephrase what your question specifically is in terms of the motion here? %$* 13
in terms of the motion, do we have to fear censorship as a result of this new law coming to effect? %$* 18
is it possible that the example of european libel law is perhaps, you know, an alarming signal to imposing something like this? %$* 18
in a sense are you saying that the climate for suppression of information in the name of protection of privacy is greater in the u.s.-- %$* 13
in the u.k. and in europe than it is here and should that be something that is relevant here and that we should worry about? %$* 13
am i getting-- %$* 13
not exactly. %$* 18
i'm saying another way of press suppression-- %$* 18
oh, in that case i'm going to respectfully pass on the question, because i want to keep it on specifically on the right that we're talking about. %$* 13
sir in the back in the red sweater, the very far back. %$* 13
thanks for your question, though. %$* 13
tim havoland. %$* 18
imagine us 30 years from now and the two college students at oklahoma university are now 50 years old. %$* 18
when their kid searches them, should it be the first thing they find, this racist chant they did, or should they not find it at all? %$* 18
i wouldn't want google to be uniquely privileged to answer that question. %$* 277
does anyone want to respond to that? %$* 13
eric posner. %$* 13
i think that would need to be public, because it was a huge public event in this country. %$* 275
i do think that if some kids put a racist statement on facebook and 30 years from now that came up i would be troubled by that, and the reason for being troubled by that is that people develop over time. %$* 275
you know, the one thing that you do as a 17- year-old or 16-year-old doesn't define you for your life. %$* 275
even if you did something a lot more serious, committed a crime, for example, the problem is that when you're 50 now, the person who googles you may well know nothing about what you've done over the last 33 years. %$* 275
and they get this hit, and although one would wish that people would take into account the passage of time, i think it's human nature to jump to conclusions and assume that this 50-year-old person is the same as the 17-year-old. %$* 275
from a statistic i read while preparing for this, i understand that in europe, 89 percent of all google users never go to the second page. %$* 13
they're only looking at what comes up on the first page. %$* 13
andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
well, so i feel this very deeply. %$* 276
the notion that one terrible thing that you do or is associated with you trails you your entire life i think is heartbreaking. %$* 276
and it's something that concerns me deeply. %$* 276
and i think a lot about that. %$* 276
you know, the internet has leapt way ahead of the human capacity to just kind of situate incidents like that in a broader context of somebody's life. %$* 276
and so, you know, my view on this is, still, censorship, which i don't mean to be kind of like a nuclear bomb that ends this argument, but to position this as what it is, which is a right to force other people to delete things that they would otherwise rather not delete is not the right answer. %$* 276
we need to have the internet evolve. %$* 276
i'll like to see google evolve, to add a more direct right to respond. %$* 276
and by the way, footnote, they've tried. %$* 276
they created something called google plus where anybody could create a profile that shows up very high on your results. %$* 276
you can populate that with any data you want to about yourself. %$* 276
and i think, broadly, though, as a society, we have to kind of learn how not to judge people in this incredibly harsh way that we seem kind of inclined to do. %$* 276
paul nemitz, may i ask you a question in terms of how the thing functions. %$* 13
in giving the deciding power, the adjudicating power to google, a private corporation, to make the decision yes or no, we're going to delete or not, what are the checks on that from outside? %$* 13
how does that work? %$* 13
well, google as a private corporation is subject to the law as anybody else. %$* 274
and, of course, its decisions can be checked. %$* 274
so, if you ask that something to be taken down, and they don't take it down, then you have, in europe, the possibility either to go to a court directly and then a judge will decide, or you can go to an independent data protection authority, which is something like an independent agency like the ftc, and they will order google, if they think the request is justified, to take it down. %$* 274
but then google has the possibility, like in europe and in america, against the decision of the ftc to go to court. %$* 274
but paul â€“ %$* 18
this is an area-- %$* 274
this is an area which is subject to the law. %$* 274
it's not a discretionary decision of google, and that's, you know, the blue sky, and beyond that there's nothing. %$* 274
google is here in the same position as any other enterprise. %$* 274
they operate in the realm of law and in europe, like in the united states, in the end, the law is applied by judges. %$* 274
and what google does, by the way-- %$* 274
and i think that is good-- %$* 274
is also very much scrutinized by the fourth power. %$* 274
it is good that the press is after google and says, be more transparent, tell us what you're doing. %$* 274
tell us what the criteria are. %$* 274
that is good. %$* 274
and we totally support it. %$* 274
i mean, of course, you know-- %$* 274
yeah, paul, i have to-- %$* 18
i think you're evading the central objection of our side to what you're saying, and it is this: all of the pressures that you just outlined are towards deletion. %$* 276
so if the person requesting it is turned down by google, they can appeal. %$* 276
they can get yet another higher authority to force the deletion. %$* 276
there is, nevertheless, in many of these stories-- %$* 276
i mean, on and on through this list that i've got here, there are crimes where there were victims. %$* 276
some of those victims might want all evidence of that crime to be disappeared. %$* 276
fine. %$* 276
but many of the victims may want those stories to live on. %$* 276
they may want the memory of their loved ones, the story of that crime, the details of the criminal's conduct to be remembered. %$* 276
but it does-- %$* 13
it does-- %$* 13
it does live on. %$* 13
it does live on. %$* 13
it's not removed from the internet. %$* 13
it's just you can't find it through the criminal's name. %$* 13
they may feel that the perpetrator should be associated with that crime. %$* 276
and it may be important to them as a matter of justice, maybe not for all the reasons that you might agree with or i might agree with, but it matters to them. %$* 276
my point is, there is a broader interest in many of these stories. %$* 276
or take the one about the referee. %$* 276
the fans of the team that was wronged by the false penalty call may want that coach-- %$* 276
sorry, referee's name to be associated with that. %$* 276
they have an interest in that. %$* 276
there are interests on both sides. %$* 275
eric posner. %$* 13
so, that's the classic rule for the law so that the interests on both sides-- %$* 275
how are they vindicated? %$* 276
and they are vindicated, and what's on the side of disclosure is something far more powerful than the government. %$* 275
it's the profit motive. %$* 275
so google makes money the better it searches up better its searches are, the more money it makes. %$* 275
this is why-- %$* 275
talking about. %$* 277
any given case on the margin, for some obscure search in the massive river of search taking place-- %$* 277
no, but they don't want to set a precedence where they-- %$* 275
google will pay no penalty for over-deleting. %$* 277
they will. %$* 275
and no one will even know. %$* 277
they will. %$* 275
who will even know? %$* 277
they will-- %$* 275
they will know because it will do worse than an alternative search engine in the world in which we have search engines competing with each other. %$* 275
and that concludes-- %$* 13
that concludes round two of this intelligence squared us debate, where our motion is the us should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
now we move on to round three. %$* 13
round three will be closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and here to make his first-- %$* 13
and here to speak first in the closing round, paul nemitz. %$* 13
he is director at the eu commission, directorate general for justice and consumers. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, i am defending the case that you should vote in favor of the notion the us should adopt a "right to be forgotten," not necessarily the one of the eu, but a "right to be forgotten." why should you vote for this notion? %$* 274
because technology moves on. %$* 274
more and more information will be collected about you by the state and by private parties. %$* 274
and your life will be plotted by them. %$* 274
your life will be profiled. %$* 274
you will be predicted, and you will be manipulated unless you have a tool in law to control your own destiny. %$* 274
and in a free society, this right is the right to information of self-determination and it means for google searches that you can ask for de-linking, provided there are no countervailing interests. %$* 274
and, of course, the most important countervailing interest is democracy, free speech, the information which is relevant for our democracy to function. %$* 274
in the end, what we are discussing here is the power relation between you as an individual, as a free citizen of the united states and on the other hand the power of google. %$* 274
is google free to do anything in terms of plotting you, predicting you and manipulating you? %$* 274
or do you, as an individual, have standing and rights to defend your freedom? %$* 274
that's what you're voting about tonight. %$* 274
if you believe individuals should have their destiny in their hand, also in the times when technology make total prediction, total collection of anything you do possible, then tonight you should vote the us should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 274
thank you very much. %$* 274
thank you, paul nemitz. %$* 13
and that's our motion, the us should adopt a "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
and here to make his closing argument against the motion, andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
he is ceo of digg and instapaper and a partner at betaworks. %$* 13
you should vote against the motion. %$* 276
paul's construction that he just put forward is a, in my judgment, false construction. %$* 276
the empowerment of an individual on one side of a conversation which is what speech on the internet is, it's people speaking, other people reading and other people choosing to remember. %$* 276
what he is trying to push is a right to force others to forget true information that they may wish to remember. %$* 276
it's that simple. %$* 276
it is an extreme solution to a very real problem. %$* 276
it's the wrong solution to a very real problem, particularly where there are other paths, more speech, a right to respond, new tools, the evolution of the social understanding of past mistakes, to deal with embarrassing mistakes that come out on the internet. %$* 276
i want to say, in response to one other point that eric raised, simply calling this what it is, which is censorship, is indeed not the end of the debate. %$* 276
we censor copyright infringement, we censor sexual abuse images of children, we censor a lot of different kinds of information. %$* 276
but it's justified and overcomes a very high bar in order to stand as an exception to the right of free speech. %$* 276
this case, the affirmative case, has not met their burden to say that the right to force other people to delete embarrassing facts from your past rises to that same level. %$* 276
it does not. %$* 276
and for that reason, you should vote against the motion. %$* 276
the final image that i want to leave you with is one that sticks in my mind whenever i think about this. %$* 276
and that is the ever-evolving photographs of the soviet politburo through the 1930s and 1940s. %$* 276
it's captured also in fiction in 1984.but you can see photographs where stalin would fall out with one of his politburo members and, sure enough, the next time they published the yearbook or the history book or the textbook, the new edition would have them completely etched out. %$* 276
we are talking about forgetting history, forgetting the past. %$* 276
the right to remember, is as important as the right to speak. %$* 276
and for that reason, you should oppose this motion. %$* 276
thank you, andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
and the motion is "the u.s.should adopt the right to be forgotten online." and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, eric posner. %$* 13
he's a professor of law at the university of chicago. %$* 13
this debate is really not about politics. %$* 275
it's not about erasing images and statements that displease the government. %$* 275
the debate is about privacy. %$* 275
privacy is a right in europe. %$* 275
it's a right in the united states. %$* 275
it's been a right in the united states for a very long time. %$* 275
it used to be controlled by tort law, an area of the law, and to some extent statutory law and other types of law. %$* 275
and i just want to ask you to imagine again but this time that it's you, that perhaps you're going through hard times in your marriage if you are married, and perhaps you get involved in a divorce. %$* 275
and divorces always work out a lot worse than people want. %$* 275
people exaggerate. %$* 275
they make allegations. %$* 275
so, imagine it's you, and your spouse says, falsely maybe, that you neglected the children or maybe a statement that you made about your own children that you wouldn't want them to hear is repeated in the court documents. %$* 275
in the old days nothing much would come from this. %$* 275
today, imagine it now, this is what people learn about you, this is the first thing that people learn about you when they google your name. %$* 275
so you go out and you talk to a potential romantic partner or a boss or a neighbor, this is the first thing they're going to hear about you, and they're going to act on it. %$* 275
now, andrew quoted orwell, i believe it was, "he who controls the past controls the future." orwell's invocation was inevitable. %$* 275
but i want to ask you, though, who is the "he" in that statement? %$* 275
is the "he" you, is the "he" me, or is the "he" google? %$* 275
thank you very much. %$* 275
thank you, eric posner. %$* 13
the motion is "the u.s.should adopt the right to be forgotten online." and here to summarize his position against this motion, jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
he is cofounder of the berkman center for internet & society. %$* 13
i can't believe in the last slot i'm still the first to be able to thank everybody, paul, eric, john, andrew, and all of you for an unforgettable evening. %$* 277
this has been wonderful. %$* 277
sorry. %$* 277
we'll strike that later. %$* 277
we've heard about a lot of nightmare stories. %$* 277
everything we do is getting immediately streamed onto the web. %$* 277
let's hope we don't get to that place. %$* 277
and i will happily join the efforts of academics, of corporate folk, and of governments to have that reality not come about. %$* 277
but notice how what the four folks were saying over the course of the evening, it's shifting. %$* 277
it's a standard that's-- %$* 277
"well, we can tweak that. %$* 277
we'll make sure that only the good stuff goes out and only the bad stuff goes out." but then i come to the question eric just asked, who is "we"? %$* 277
and in the proposal "we" is google, not just being ordered to do something but being the decider reviewable only if the complainant is not happy with the result. %$* 277
that is basically built-- %$* 277
wired into the proposal. %$* 277
and i didn't hear from the other side answers to questions like, "when google makes those decisions, is the public allowed to know? %$* 277
are the websites themselves that are affected allowed to know? %$* 277
" paul has been working i think to make sure not on a specific case, only on the overall criteria, that seems very, very dangerous to me. %$* 277
now, john said we didn't know solutions. %$* 277
and in 30 seconds, it's true that we can't unpack them very well. %$* 277
but i'd encourage people to look at solutions very specific to very sensitive systems of records like legal documents and court materials, that options for contextualization to include possibly even somebody like google deciding, and when it's a search on a name maybe the first result shouldn't be those 10 terrible whatever comes out of the roulette wheel links but a curated page marked as such and then many won't go to the second page, reputation systems and, of course competition-- %$* 277
jonathan zittrain, i'm sorry-- %$* 13
can i end with one thing-- %$* 277
your time is up. %$* 13
no thank you very much, just in fairness to everybody. %$* 13
thank you, jonathan. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and, again, look at this motion "the u.s. should adopt the right to be forgotten online." if you have been persuaded that this motion is-- %$* 13
has been well argued, push number one. %$* 13
if you are on the opposite side, push number two, and if you're undecided push number three. %$* 13
then we'll have the results in just a moment. %$* 13
before we do that i want to say that this was a little bit of a tough debate in terms of it was relatively nuanced and i really want to congratulate, in a couple of ways, the teams for helping bring this to all of us and making it clear. %$* 13
paul nemitz for devoting a lot of your opening statement to actually explaining so clearly what we're talking about. %$* 13
you just did us all a service. %$* 13
it was a very teachable moment for all of us. %$* 13
so, thank you for doing that. %$* 13
and for the side arguing against the motion, although they were not obliged to tell us what their better plan was or what else could work, it was actually useful to all of us to hear that. %$* 13
so, i want to thank you for that. %$* 13
and jonathan, what is it you were going to say before i cut you off? %$* 13
now that the voting is done. %$* 13
here was the landing i was hoping to make. %$* 277
we all agree that people are not as bad as their own worst deed and should not be judged by that. %$* 277
by the same token, institutions are not as good as their own press releases and we can't trust them to be so. %$* 277
well, i'm sorry the clock is my master and has to be your master, but the people voted before hearing that, but thanks very much. %$* 13
i just wanted to give you your moment. %$* 13
i also want to let-- %$* 13
tell everybody who got up and asked a question, even the ones that i had to pass on, it takes a lot of guts to do and the questions were actually superb tonight, so thank you everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
i also want to thank our generous donors and supporters, some of whom are here tonight. %$* 13
for those of you who don't know, we are a non-profit organization and the ticket sales don't come close to covering the cost of mounting a great debate like this. %$* 13
so, i'd encourage you if you would be willing to make a donation to go to our website, that's iq2us.org and make a donation there. %$* 13
our next debate is later this month. %$* 13
it's at columbia university at the miller theater. %$* 13
we're partnering with the richard paul richmond center for business law and public policy at columbia, as well as with the national constitution center, we're going to be continuing our ongoing debates on constitutional issues that we started last year in philadelphia. %$* 13
the topic at columbia will cover whether the president has exceeded his constitutional authority to wage war. %$* 13
and in april we're going to be back here on the 15th in this theater and our motion will be abolish the death penalty. %$* 13
we hope to see a lot of you at both of those debates and i want to get to the results now, because it is all in. %$* 13
we have the final results. %$* 13
once again the motion was the u.s.should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
we've heard the arguments-- %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
did i-- %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
there's chatter that i thought was response to some sort of mistake i made. %$* 13
oh, it came up already? %$* 13
it was erased. %$* 18
does anybody remember? %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
well, for the sake of people who are listening-- %$* 13
play along, please. %$* 13
our motion is this: the u.s. should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
remember, the team whose numbers have moved the most between the two votes is the team that will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the first vote. %$* 13
the u.s.should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online and the first vote 36 percent agreed, 26 percent were against, 38 percent were undecided. %$* 13
in the second vote the result was for the team arguing for the motion their second vote was 35 percent, that means they lost one percentage point. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, their first vote was 26 percent, second was 56 percent. %$* 13
they went up 36 percent. %$* 13
the team arguing against this motion of a right to be forgotten online has won this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
thank you for me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

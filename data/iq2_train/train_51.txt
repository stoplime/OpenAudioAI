if you can stand, sir? %$* 13
warren ilchman. %$* 18
i’ve heard al-qaeda and its affiliates, and i’ve heard hezbollah mentioned, but no one has mentioned in the whole evening the taliban. %$* 18
must the taliban be defeated before the war on terror is completed? %$* 18
which side would you like to put that question to first? %$* 13
okay, let’s put it to peter bergen. %$* 13
i think the taliban has to be made irrelevant, and the taliban to a large degree is becoming less relevant in afghanistan over time. %$* 91
i think what we’re looking at, if we pull out for a little bit-- %$* 91
there are still marxist-leninists somewhere in the united states on some college campus somewhere. %$* 91
just no one pays any attention to them. %$* 91
and you know, we’re at the point where al-qaeda and its ideas and we’ve included that in the taliban, which, by the way, enjoys only a seven percent favorable rating in afghanistan right now. %$* 91
there’s nothing like living under the taliban as a prophylactic to their ideas about creating a utopia here on earth, don’t make sense. %$* 91
so these ideas are becoming irrelevant, and that’s why the war on terror should be ended. %$* 91
we’ve just heard from rich that he won’t even tell us when the war will end. %$* 91
well, if it doesn’t end with the founder and leader of al-qaeda, the intellectual author of 9/11, which is the reason we went to war in afghanistan in the first place, the fact the taliban wouldn’t hand him over-- %$* 91
if it doesn’t end when it’s totally irrelevant in the middle east, if it doesn’t end when it’s the war of ideas in the muslim world, if it doesn’t end when its entire top leadership is decimated, i mean, when does it end? %$* 91
richard falkenrath, is the taliban irrelevant? %$* 13
no, it’s not. %$* 119
i mean, it’s not irrelevant. %$* 119
it certainly matters a lot in the reconstruction of afghanistan and the geopolitics of that region. %$* 119
there’s no question that they supported 9/11, the taliban organization. %$* 119
they supported al-qaeda prior to 9/11. now, it looks like that was a very expensive thing for them to do, and there are other groups in this area-- %$* 119
peter is actually far more expert on this than i am-- %$* 119
that are still supporting the remnants of al-qaeda central such as it were. %$* 119
so that’s a long-winded way of saying they are not essential to some sort of winning the war on terror, prevailing them, but there’s no question that because of their historical legacy, they are legitimate targets for the u.s. military in what we are calling here the war on terror as it operates in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 119
i’d like to blend both peter and richard’s point. %$* 77
the destruction of them may not be required in the same way that you want to destroy al-qaeda core. %$* 77
peter’s comment about destroying their relevance, i think, is the actual objective there. %$* 77
ma’am? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
if you can rise and the mic will come to you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
often a war is constituted with troop levels. %$* 19
so i would like to know each side’s perspective on troop levels in ending the war or continuing the war. %$* 19
troop levels where? %$* 13
i’m not sure-- %$* 13
well, can you try another crack at that? %$* 13
do you believe that troops should be brought out of afghanistan to-- %$* 19
where the war is being conducted? %$* 19
or should we continue to have troops and for how long? %$* 19
my last appearance at this debate forum was arguing that the war in afghanistan was something to continue, with max boot. %$* 91
he is also here in the audience. %$* 91
i think it would be difficult for me to now change my mind and in such a public fashion. %$* 91
and i think that we, you know, we-- %$* 91
there are things that we, you know, making sure that afghanistan doesn’t revert into a haven for the taliban and a lot of groups is, you know, that is a very good thing. %$* 91
you know, it was the war on terror kind of construct that got into a war which cost us a lot more in blood and treasure where we were not attacked from, which, of course, was iraq. %$* 91
michael hayden. %$* 13
i agree very strongly with what peter said. %$* 77
and i would suggest to you that the size of the american footprint there over time matters. %$* 77
i mean, it does have an effect. %$* 77
but far more important is the persistence of the american footprint. %$* 77
we left that region before, and we suffered for it greatly on 9/11. %$* 77
and so i think peter and i are in strong agreement that some substantial american presence there, as difficult as that is for us for a variety of reasons, keeps us so much safer that it's probably worth those sacrifices. %$* 77
but is that presence of-- %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
does that constitute war, peter? %$* 13
well, as juliette said and i've said, i mean, we're not opposed to conducting continuing our presence in afghanistan and making sure that it doesn't revert into a safe haven - - %$* 91
but we're talking about what we call it. %$* 13
so would you call it-- %$* 13
war-- %$* 13
well, it's a war against al-qaeda and its allies. %$* 91
the president, president obama, correctly redefined downwards this open-ended global conflict against the tactic and named the enemy. %$* 91
and that's the enemy that we continue to fight. %$* 91
okay. %$* 13
right in the center. %$* 13
the people on this side define ending the war on terror as repealing the legal instrument that authorized military force. %$* 18
i don't understand, on this side, exactly what it is that you do, what you define the ending of the end of the war on terror. %$* 18
is it declaring victory and going home? %$* 18
because president bush did that on the aircraft carrier. %$* 18
how'd that go? %$* 238
didn't go so well. %$* 18
i just don't understand exactly what it is that you think-- %$* 18
should president obama give a speech and-- %$* 18
we're not-- %$* 238
we're not-- %$* 238
declare victory? %$* 18
well, so here's-- %$* 238
juliette kayyem. %$* 13
what's so interesting about this. %$* 238
we're not asking for a-- %$* 238
this war is over. %$* 238
i mean, if anything, i hope that the description of the last year showed this may be a bit too late, not to criticize intelligence squared, that i actually think without you knowing it, we did end the war on terror and that in trying to expose how we ended it, it's-- %$* 238
and what the reason for discussing it in such an open manner is because how we talk about counterterrorism measures, whether it's killing bin laden or it's bringing someone to an article 3 court, or it's working with arab and muslim communities so that they will feel comfortable with the nypd and tell them when there might be extremists amongst their midst, certainly the nypd has been great at. %$* 238
but we're-- %$* 238
so that is an acknowledgment of the reality of where we are, because it affects how we perceive ourselves. %$* 238
it clearly affects how everyone else perceives us in the outside world. %$* 238
and the war on terror is not a benign statement. %$* 238
we've been sitting here hearing, oh, yes, we may have gone too far, and maybe this war-- %$* 238
it wasn't benign. %$* 238
and so maybe part of our obligation 10 years later is to admit it's not a benign term. %$* 238
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
i think the question underscores one of the difficulties in juliette and peter's position on here. %$* 119
and if i can just sharpen it and pose it also as a question. %$* 119
since we've agreed-- %$* 119
or at least i think that juliette concedes we shouldn't change the legal framework that currently governs counterterrorism operations by u.s.forces abroad. %$* 119
you could talk about it rhetorically differently. %$* 119
and in fact, president obama could have his aircraft carrier moment right now wherever he wanted, to go out and announce that he is announcing the end of the war on terror. %$* 119
okay, now, question, you used to work for him in the cabinet department, could go back and work for him. %$* 119
would you recommend he do that? %$* 119
why would i not recommend that? %$* 238
i'm asking, you would? %$* 119
he would never do it, first of all, no-- %$* 119
and because the politics-- %$* 238
you'd be fired. %$* 119
let me tell you why he wouldn't, because it took me nine months to move 19 massachusetts national guard members from the pilgrim facility, because the war on terror is not benign, because this notion of the war on terror, it has completely limited our politicians' capacity to move. %$* 238
and i think the amazing thing about this president is how much he has moved us. %$* 238
but this gets to the question that came up earlier. %$* 119
right? %$* 238
so if i think it would be bad political advice, and he should fire me if i told-- %$* 238
in the same way, you know, if i told him to say the war on terror is over, not because i think it's inaccurate but because i actually think that politically we-- %$* 238
that the public and the way we talk about it gives no opportunity for the kinds of changes, the little changes i had to make or the big changes that have been made. %$* 238
all right, richard come in on this-- %$* 13
i think this circles back to an earlier question, which is what gain would come from accepting your side of this argument. %$* 119
and what would happen is president obama and his advisors would say, look i’ve already realized all the gains. %$* 119
we’ve talked about it differently, i’ve won the nobel peace prize, i don’t need to do this. %$* 119
it’s already done. %$* 119
so you agree that it’s over. %$* 238
isn’t that what you’re saying? %$* 238
you are admitting-- %$* 238
you are also admitting that it would be political suicide for anyone to say it. %$* 238
and all i’m saying is, maybe we can create a space where that’s not true. %$* 238
where we can move 19 massachusetts national guard members, or we can create more stringent military commissions, or we can close the black sites or whatever it is that we need to do, and that’s actually a good thing because it means we’ve changed over 10 years. %$* 238
sir. %$* 13
my name is josh steps i’m from sydney, australia. %$* 18
in an attempt to bridge this definition or gap about the war on terror. %$* 18
my question for richard. %$* 18
don’t you feel that over the long arch of history that maybe that the greatest inhibition of people’s freedom is governments and not so much terrorism and outside threats, and do you fear that maybe an open-ended war that goes forever that you’re not even able to say when it could possibly end, is more of a liability, even if it gives us more of a tool, more tools in the arsenal in the short term, that maybe the long-term liability outweighs that, and how do you feel about – %$* 18
interesting question. %$* 13
it’s a great question, in fact it’s several questions marbled together. %$* 119
and one is that there’s no question that over the arch of history that governments have done more harm to human beings than any terrorist organization. %$* 119
governments are capable of enormous destruction, there’s no question about that. %$* 119
and i don’t think that al-qaeda or any terrorist group is 10 feet tall. %$* 119
i don't go to sleep afraid. %$* 119
i never did. %$* 119
and they are what i think is ultimately a manageable problem. %$* 119
in this-- %$* 119
there's always the potential for government excess. %$* 119
government in our country domestically has a monopoly on the use of force and is authorized in certain circumstances to invade your liberty and your privacy in all sorts of ways. %$* 119
and one of the great debates in this country and in any country is how do you set those rules and what are they? %$* 119
and it's not set in stone. %$* 119
it evolves, changes over time. %$* 119
in fact, the last 10 years since 9/11 have illustrated that, and it has evolved greatly. %$* 119
and i think juliette pointed this out that there have been, in every single functional area, it has evolved. %$* 119
but here i want to come back to what my colleague, mike, said, there really is, today, a consensus on this. %$* 119
there really is. %$* 119
it's remarkable. %$* 119
on electronic surveillance, there is a consensus. %$* 119
there was not in 2005 when james risen published the details of a certain classified program. %$* 119
today, there is. %$* 119
fisa modernization act was passed, broad bipartisan support. %$* 119
obama is all for it. %$* 119
bush was for it, no problem. %$* 119
on detention, right, there is actually consensus on what happens now from where it was with bush to today. %$* 119
on tribunals, also consensus. %$* 119
president obama has expressly endorsed the military tribunal process signed into law by president bush, enacted by the previous congress. %$* 119
so a long-winded way of saying, to your question, yes, there are risks that we must constantly be vigilant for them. %$* 119
but there is broad consensus right now on where those lines should be drawn across the political elite in washington. %$* 119
this narrative of consensus was not a consensus-- %$* 238
juliette kayyem. %$* 13
necessarily of choice, right? %$* 238
i mean, let's not forget-- %$* 238
it's not like all these like really smart people sat in a room and go, okay, well maybe we're excessive then, but now we're going to be all kumbaya and figure out how to do this right. %$* 238
it was a consensus because the bush administration lost a lot in court, because congress required them to make changes and that lasted into the obama administration. %$* 238
because their own national security experts, including interrogators, people in the military justice system, lawyers in the department of justice who didn't like the secret surveillance were rebelling. %$* 238
this was not-- %$* 238
so i'm glad that there's a consensus, but it's just-- %$* 238
i challenge this notion that-- %$* 238
ask you to remember that this sort of came about because, in all actuality, every smart person thinks the same. %$* 238
michael hayden. %$* 13
so it's very, very difficult decisions. %$* 238
michael hayden. %$* 13
it's a very great question that you raised, maybe let me give you a different perspective on what they do to states and what they do to their citizens. %$* 77
we have certain authorities, all right, that the states exercise that for reasons of discomfort or political risk or what else? %$* 77
a government decides not to exercise the full extent of their authorities. %$* 77
and because of doing that, very bad things happen to their citizens because they did not do all that they could do. %$* 77
if they did not do all that the law allowed, then for political reasons, they played back from the line. %$* 77
i used to describe this to our work force as to why we had to be as aggressive as we possibly could be within the law, because my view is this sort of box i'm creating for you is the field in which we're allowed to play. %$* 77
if we play back from those lines, and we fail, and bad things happen to you-- %$* 77
of a catastrophic nature that-- %$* 77
like happened ten years ago, that box i drew here, you're going to draw a different box. %$* 77
you are. %$* 77
and the box is going to be this way. %$* 77
so in another way, the way we security professionals, the intelligence community view this is we have to be very aggressive within the law doing our job because if we fail the natural tendency of a country like ours or a country like australia would be to do things probably destructive to the long term liberties out of fear. %$* 77
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and remember, you members of the audience, you voted before the debate, we're going to ask you to vote once again afterwards, this is their last chance to change your mind. %$* 13
i'd also, with your indulgence, like to just record one more item for the radio broadcast, to allow them to take a break in the middle of the section that just happened, and it would be wonderful if i could ask you to applaud. %$* 13
i'll say my line and then we can move forward, okay? %$* 13
so if you could just applaud, that would be terrific, thank you. %$* 13
welcome back to this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
we're in the question and answer section. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "it is time to end the war on terror." that's it. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so now on to round three. %$* 13
these are closing statements. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
each debater is speaking in turn. %$* 13
and our motion is, "it is time to end the war on terror," and speaking first against the motion, michael hayden, former director of the national security agency and the cia. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 77
our, rich’s purpose and mind here tonight was not to defend all aspects of what our government has done over the last 10 years. %$* 77
there have been a lot of thoughts put out about some things that some people find offensive or uncomfortable about what we've done. %$* 77
i actually think a lot of those points are debatable, but that's not tonight's debate. %$* 77
what we're looking at is, broadly speaking, how should we conceive ourselves in order to insure our own national security. %$* 77
and i mean no disrespect but i'm trying to follow in detail what it is we're arguing against from the other side. %$* 77
and i think it's not an unfair characterization continue what we're doing, that we have a desperate plea to repackage the atmospherics around which that which we are doing. %$* 77
and i'm trying to parse out the arguments for just repackaging. %$* 77
and from peter i think i'm getting the argument that you've been successful, back off, you've won the thing. %$* 77
and from juliette i'm getting the argument, you shouldn't have been doing all those things that you were doing that peter said were successful because it enabled you to win those things. %$* 77
this is an important matter. %$* 77
that one percent of the republic that's defending the other 99 percent needs to know you're with them and that you're behind them. %$* 77
and i mentioned in my earlier comments about not being too celebratory, and peter's right, massive events in the last six months, the arab spring and the killing of bin laden. %$* 77
if one were to write a history of the american civil war, one could determine i think looking backward that the decisive events took place in the first three days of july in 1863 with the fall of vicksburg and the defeat of pickett's charge going up cemetery hill. %$* 77
i think historians would agree, it was decisive, but there was 21 months of war left after that. %$* 77
and spiking the football and calling it a win and walking away from the battlefield in july of 1863 would have put at risk all that we now know have been achieved by that point. %$* 77
thank you, michael hayden. %$* 13
our motion is, "it is time to end the war on terror," and to speak for the motion, peter bergen, a cnn national security analyst and director of national security studies at the new america foundation. %$* 13
we’ve heard from rich tonight that al-qaeda isn't 10 feet tall and also it's a manageable problem but also that we should be at war against this terrorism tactic until the 22nd century, and that there's no circumstances that he can define tonight when we should declare the end of this war. %$* 91
and as we were thinking about this question, we turned to two of the leading experts on terrorism in the world for some counsel, one of them said, we here in the united states certainly are much safer. %$* 91
al-qaeda still exists but it's been massively damaged. %$* 91
through nine years of an onslaught against them, our defensive abilities here in the country, our intelligence, our law enforcement, our homeland security is much better, so there's no question the united states is safer. %$* 91
the second leading expert said just a few weeks ago, future attacks are going to be more numerous but less complex, less well organized, less well likely to succeed, and less lethal if they do succeed. %$* 91
i think the killing of bin laden will accelerate that change. %$* 91
the first expert was richard falkenrath speaking to cnn almost exactly a year ago. %$* 91
and the second expert was general hayden speaking to the associated press this summer after the death of bin laden. %$* 91
we agree with both these gentlemen that al-qaeda has been massively damaged and that there’s no question that we’re safer and that this much weakened al-qaeda is far less likely to succeed with even small-bore attacks it will try and pull off in the future and that this process of al-qaeda decline has been accelerated with the death of their leader. %$* 91
and for these reasons, and because we agree with these gentlemen, and others we’ve outlined this evening, we urge you to vote for the motion that "it's time to end the war on terror.” %$* 91
thank you, peter bergen. %$* 13
our motion is "it's time to end the war on terror.” and here to speak against the motion, richard falkenrath, who is former deputy commissioner for counterterrorism at the nypd and deputy homeland security advisor. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 119
it’s a real pleasure tonight to argue this out. %$* 119
it is a very important issue. %$* 119
juliette and i have many things in common. %$* 119
we both were at harvard for awhile. %$* 119
we have children who are about the same age. %$* 119
we also had the privilege of serving at both the federal level of government, in my case the local, her the state level. %$* 119
and that perspective for me was immensely valuable, to come to new york-- %$* 119
i was not a new yorker, but i came here to work at the nypd for four years. %$* 119
it gave me a different perspective on these issues and one that i think is illustrative. %$* 119
the easiest thing to do for us, in this debate, tactically, is just to sort of to decry the rhetorical excesses that frankly juliette decried of the first few years after the bush administration. %$* 119
it was a very divisive time in our political life, very troubling time, frankly. %$* 119
but i was struck today actually walking to this debate. %$* 119
i saw something that made me say i shouldn’t just dismiss it all completely, which was there was a fire truck going by, and it was making a big loud siren. %$* 119
and it was barreling to some emergency. %$* 119
and on the front, they had stenciled “support our troops,” which said to me that the local responders, these local officials who were not in the military and have no extra authority gained from any of these laws that had been passed, in fact see a certain common purpose with the military officers and the intelligence officers who are still at war in a technical although somewhat invisible sense. %$* 119
and that’s, i think, a useful way to remember this. %$* 119
it isn’t the sense of unity that this country achieved post-9/11 about dealing with this problem also was a little bit a-historic, which is my way of saying, yes, there were many bad things that happened at that time, things that i criticized and, as peter notes, i’ve written about it and talked about in papers and stuff like that. %$* 119
but there were also some good elements of it. %$* 119
and if there was no better way rhetorically to unify the various actions of many different parts of america, the military and the intelligence, the lawyers, the first responders, the rest, than war on terror. %$* 119
that’s what they came up with, and it worked all right. %$* 119
so, on that basis, in addition to the legal arguments we’ve urged you to accept, i urge you to vote against this motion. %$* 119
thank you, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
our motion is “it is time to end the war on terror,” and here to speak for the motion, juliette kayyem, the national security and foreign policy columnist for the boston globe and former assistant secretary at the department of homeland security. %$* 13
so general hayden and rich falkenrath, i want to thank you both and thank you both for your service and this audience as well. %$* 238
they would have you believe that we simply want to repackage something, and they would have you believe that we would want to throw away laws that would have given obama the authority to kill bin laden. %$* 238
and they want you to believe that there’s this continuity of behavior over the course of the 10 years. %$* 238
and none of that is true. %$* 238
and i actually think none of it is true because, one, we’re not saying throw away the laws, throw away the authorization for the use of military force, nor is the war on terror a benign statement. %$* 238
it is neither descriptive anymore nor is it benign. %$* 238
and the continuity has actually been one of the-- %$* 238
i think what’s happened over the last 10 years has been sort of remarkable because it was not continuous, that what you saw over time was the american public, congress, the courts, the supreme court several times, the bush administration itself with its own internal conflicts, and a change in leadership between the presidents, show that it wasn’t continuous. %$* 238
it’s not just the excesses that i said. %$* 238
it was actually what made us better, what made our counterterrorism measures better. %$* 238
and they got better over time, so that all sorts of things are not happening because of this learning curve. %$* 238
so now we’re supposed to wake up 10 years later and say, “okay, well, that was-- %$* 238
it was good we called it that and let’s just continue calling it that because that was-- %$* 238
it’s benign,” or, it’s just a legal matter. %$* 238
and all we’re asking you to do is actually think about that a little bit differently. %$* 238
remember the 10 years, be grateful for the work of both administrations, but also realize the war on terror as a unifying force is no longer accurate or benign. %$* 238
thank you. %$* 238
thank you, juliette kayyem. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seats. %$* 13
our motion is, it is time to end the war on terror. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we're about two minutes away from having that number tabulated and compared to the opening votes, and we'll be able to declare a winner. %$* 13
so before we get to that, i have a few things i want to take care of, beginning with wanting to thank this panel for the quality of the discussion that they brought here shall the respect-- %$* 13
they've shown each other. %$* 13
their expertise was on display as well as their respect for the power of a good argument. %$* 13
also, is your daughter shy about taking bows in audiences? %$* 13
she's not? %$* 13
so your children are, i'm assuming, up in boston. %$* 13
but one of richard's-- %$* 13
two of your kids are here. %$* 13
so why don't you-- %$* 13
because they're pretty young for a policy debate, so why don't you stand up and-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
they looked at you with admiring eyes throughout the debate. %$* 13
i also want to take note of the fact that our audience includes a contingent from west point. %$* 13
so i want to thank you guys and women for coming down here. %$* 13
and we had a number of people watching life stream on slate. %$* 13
we want to thank them for-- %$* 13
for participating and watching and sending in the questions. %$* 13
and also for you as an audience, you were a terrific audience, and we did hear you, and i appreciated all of your applause, both spontaneous and rehearsed and requested by me. %$* 13
thanks a lot for that. %$* 13
so we're all going to be back here on tuesday, september 20th. %$* 13
our motion on the 20th of september is "men are finished." arguing for this motion, we have dan abrams, my colleague at abc news. %$* 13

but then they turn into earners and taxpayers. %$* 222
and so if you look over their whole lives, if you look at the federal story as well, it's about an even-even. %$* 222
social security, they pay in every year about $7 billion that they don't take out because they pay in on-- %$* 222
illegal immigrants pay in on social security numbers, and they don't recoup the costs. %$* 222
so they get to keep the-- %$* 222
but your opponents have made the case that in other ways that immigrants and illegal immigrants especially are drawing on the welfare system. %$* 13
well, they're exaggerating their welfare numbers. %$* 222
but let me just make my-- %$* 222
2010 census. %$* 18
let me just make a closing point. %$* 222
the point is that what you're leaving out is growth, is the growth they make possible. %$* 222
okay. %$* 13
and let me just give you a couple numbers. %$* 222
so in the state of north carolina, they measured over the '90s, what an immigrants-- %$* 222
what was the fiscal cost and what was the growth made possible in consumption and adding to businesses. %$* 222
fiscal costs over 10 years, $61 million. %$* 222
now, that's real money, that's those costs by latinos coming to the states-- %$* 222
growth, growth, 11 billion-- %$* 222
all right. %$* 13
tamar, i-- %$* 13
we see where you're going with the growth %$* 13
growth, 11 billion. %$* 222
take it, but i want your opponents to respond to your earlier point. %$* 13
that rightwing organization, the national academy of sciences, i mean, will you accept that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues? %$* 219
i mean, it doesn't have-- %$* 219
to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't have a dog in this fight, it doesn't have a political bone to pick with anybody. %$* 219
it's the national academy of sciences. %$* 219
you can argue with the-- %$* 219
with cis and other studies, but the national academy of sciences shows that you're not correct, tamar, when you suggest that this isn't a fiscal drain on this country. %$* 219
it most certainly is. %$* 219
that's not what that study found. %$* 222
it is also just common sense, it's not even something that you have to go through reams of statistical evidence to prove it is common sense. %$* 219
if you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not going to be able to pay the income taxes you're talking about, but you are undeniably going to require the services, the services for your children, the children who are in the public school system, the services for the-- %$* 219
the social services-- %$* 219
and i consider educating the workforce of the future-- %$* 222
the social service benefits. %$* 219
i consider educating the workforce for the future not as a welfare benefit but an investment. %$* 222
yeah, or in the day today %$* 219
tamar cedes some time to her colleague, julián castro. %$* 13
sure, an investment. %$* 219
well, okay, how about the investment in our prison system? %$* 219
tom, tom, tom, i want to bring in julián castro. %$* 13
well, what congressman tancredo may remember as well is that in 2006 the republican state comptroller of texas did an analysis that said that-- %$* 220
that analyzed how much revenue-- %$* 220
state revenue had been generated by illegal immigrants and found it at $1.58 billion and said that $1.16 billion in state resources had been taken by illegal immigrants, and so this idea that it is just is so clear cut across the country, that's not true. %$* 220
kris kobach. %$* 13
i with that study, that texas comptroller study looked-- %$* 221
it didn't just look at fiscal income and outgo, then they went on and considered, "well, have there been generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra-- %$* 221
right. %$* 222
consumption that might have occurred? %$* 221
" now, that's fine, and look, let's get this straight, the fiscal debate is clear, they are a fiscal drag. %$* 221
now, i will agree that there are - - we get cheaper vegetables because of this, but you have to realize there are winners and there are losers. %$* 221
the winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor, the losers are the consumer-- %$* 221
the winners are the consumers of some goods who really want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce, but the losers are the u.s.citizens who lose their jobs, the u.s.citizens who are still working in those fields and are getting paid a lower wage, and the taxpayers. %$* 221
there's no doubt the taxpayers are the losers. %$* 221
none of this is true, that no economists-- %$* 222
no economists looking for a wage effect, there’s been people studying it for 20 years, even the most-- %$* 222
george borjas-- %$* 221
yeah-- %$* 222
2007. %$* 221
has found that over 20 years there's a less than five percent wage effect for the people at the very-- %$* 222
for a high school dropout. %$* 222
so you can see there is a wage effect. %$* 221
and other-- %$* 222
economists challenge him and say-- %$* 222
i agree. %$* 221
it’s less than one percent, and other economists who studied it say that so the division is between over 20 years for the-- %$* 222
only the 10 percent of americans who drop out of high school, that for them it’s between one and four, and for everyone else it’s actually gains is wages-- %$* 222
can i see if we agree on this point? %$* 221
for everyone else it’s gains in wages because having low skilled people there makes the productivity of the higher workers go up. %$* 222
so do we agree on-- %$* 221
do we agree on the borjas numbers? %$* 221
says that if you have a 10 percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent, and in the long term a decrease in wages of three to four percent, in the long term. %$* 221
so we agree on that, they can decide whether that's significant or not. %$* 221
three to four, three to four. %$* 222
i think that’s significant. %$* 221
for other high school dropouts. %$* 222
julián castro, you-- %$* 13
no, no-- %$* 222
julián, you heard your opponent. %$* 13
moving on to a different part of this argument, and that’s the assimilation argument, your opponent's raising the concern that the wave of immigrants that we’re talking about for the most part, poor immigrants and illegal immigrants as well, that they’re not coming-- %$* 13
they’re not really becoming part of the culture. %$* 13
they come to dip their toes and to remain speaking spanish and to remain with the dream of going back home ultimately and not really buying in. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
sure, i’d say first that it’s been a common theme in american history, this impulse to believe that anyone who is other than the dominant majority is somehow going to poison the culture. %$* 220
and look at us all these years later as a nation, we are a very strong nation, we’re the number one economy in the world. %$* 220
we’re a nation where folks are learning english, where they are participating in democracy. %$* 220
you know, in my own family, for instance, just anecdotally, my grandmother that i grew up with, came to the united states when she was very young from mexico, and tonight i’m speaking perfect english, not spanish, so. %$* 220
by the way, i hear your spanish is pretty terrible. %$* 13
my english is about 100 times better than my spanish, and really the idea is not that, you know-- %$* 220
the idea is that you see a common trajectory, no matter whether it’s the germans that benjamin franklin was talking about, the chinese that we tried to exclude, you know, the french that we were, we passed the alien sedition act for, or today, the hispanic culture, folks embrace america-- %$* 220
right, but i think your opponents are arguing it in several ways. %$* 13
this time it’s different. %$* 13
and i want to go back to tom tancredo and why is it different? %$* 13
it would be exactly the same, quite frankly, if the numbers were close. %$* 219
what i mean by that is this-- %$* 219
all during the period of time that we talk about as being the heyday of immigration to this country, we of course witnessed exactly what you say in terms of people coming here and being, you know, sort of sequestered or put in-- %$* 219
or sequestering themselves. %$* 219
i mean, it didn’t always happen because we forced it that way. %$* 219
you know, groups settled where they were comfortable, settled in what we call ghettos sometimes. %$* 219
but that’s natural. %$* 219
it’s a natural phenomenon. %$* 219
they’re going to look for the people that they know, the language they understand, the customs and habits that they’re familiar with, perfectly natural. %$* 219
what happened in the past is that the numbers allowed for, and also the timeouts that i mentioned earlier, allowed for an assimilation process. %$* 219
even if people didn’t want to, they were almost forced into it in order to get ahead in the country. %$* 219
of course, there was the issue of english. %$* 219
my grandparents, i can remember so distinctly my grandmother and grandfather in the back seat of the car, sunday afternoon drive, after a couple of hours, they had been together for probably long enough in close proximity so they started to argue about things. %$* 219
and my grandfather would lapse into italian and my grandmother would yell at him, “speak american, dammit! %$* 219
”and it was her purpose, and it-- %$* 219
but why are you saying that’s not happening in the mexican communities as well? %$* 13
because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a geographic area that bring the culture-- %$* 219
you’re saying there’s a critical mass-- %$* 13
you’re saying there’s a critical mass in this case that makes it different-- %$* 13
that makes is much more difficult to assimilate. %$* 219
i just want to see what the other side’s response to that. %$* 13
people in the second generation, even among poor-- %$* 222
children of poor mexicans, everyone learns english. %$* 222
and the third generation, three-quarters of the people can’t speak spanish anymore, can’t speak to their grandmother. %$* 222
people are learning english as they did in the past. %$* 222
no, it’s not, tamar. %$* 18
where i want to shift the conversation is, i believe that the policies of our opposing team would actually make integration or assimilation harder, not easier. %$* 222
they want to keep people on the wrong side of the law, not let them make restitution and get right with the law and come into society. %$* 222
they want to end birthright citizenship so that the children of immigrants grow up not as citizens, which every study that’s looked at it has shown makes the parents less likely to learn the language and integrate. %$* 222
all right, before you go through your list, i’d like to give them a chance to respond. %$* 13
kris kobach? %$* 13
there are-- %$* 221
obviously, assimilation has occurred and obviously assimilation can occur in the future in america. %$* 221
but assimilation doesn’t happen automatically. %$* 221
as tom mentioned, you have to have-- %$* 221
there’s a tipping point. %$* 221
if the percentage of the immigrant population is so high and is so disproportionately speaking one language or sharing one culture, then the pressure from the rest of us, the rest of the american society, on that group to assimilate is lower. %$* 221
kris, the point that was just made by your-- %$* 13
the point that was just made was, for example, a policy that you mentioned before of denying in-state tuition prices to immigrants actually acts to stifle assimilation because those are going to be kids who won’t be going to school. %$* 13
well, actually, it’s to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home. %$* 221
that’s the idea. %$* 221
now, but let me-- %$* 221
let me give one more point on assimilation, and that is one of the greatest engines of assimilation-- %$* 221
i think we can all agree on this-- %$* 221
is the public schools. %$* 221
in the past for the last 100 years or so, the public schools have been the primary engine of assimilation. %$* 221
that engine is not working anymore. %$* 221
according to a study done at a high school in san diego, i think in 2002 or 2003, after three years of high school, the proportion of students self-identifying themselves as americans went down 50 percent. %$* 221
the proportion saying they were hyphenated americans, in other words, mexican- american or something like that, went down 30 percent. %$* 221
and the number that they were saying they are a foreign nationality after three years of high school went up 52 percent. %$* 221
and that study was done in the middle of the battle over prop 187, which was denying benefits to immigrants-- %$* 222
that was in 1994. %$* 221
had commercials on tv saying stop them coming-- %$* 222
i know the study you’re talking about, rumbaugh’s study, and what he was showing was that when there’s an anti-immigrant climate, people get alienated and identify with their group. %$* 222
and that’s exactly what i would argue your side is creating, is an anti-immigrant climate that drives people to identify with their group and not assimilate. %$* 222
do you see the logic? %$* 13
i just want to-- %$* 13
i’m not taking sides, but tamar jacoby has presented a logical explanation there. %$* 13
i’d just like you to take it on. %$* 13
tom tancredo. %$* 13
sure, the logical argument is this: if people come into this country illegally, especially illegally, we should all go, huh, well, you're an immigrant, and therefore we should be happy about the fact you're here. %$* 219
we should not-- %$* 219
we should not raise our concerns about it. %$* 219
we should not say that people should come into the country the legal way. %$* 219
there is a door. %$* 219
180-- %$* 219
165,000 people a month come in today still legally. %$* 219
we are the most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration. %$* 219
but the minute we start talking about the fact that people are violating american laws to get here, that's all of a sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants. %$* 219
well, bologna. %$* 219
i will not accept the idea that you can't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into this country illegally. %$* 219
i agree with you that illegal immigration-- %$* 222
i agree with you-- %$* 222
what's wrong with that? %$* 219
that illegal immigration is not what the country wants. %$* 222
and i agree with you-- %$* 222
but you want to grant an amnesty. %$* 219
that we need enforcement of the rule of law. %$* 222
but the problem is our system makes it hard to enter legally, and we don't have enough places for the workers we need. %$* 222
and then we make it easy to enter illegally. %$* 222
a million-- %$* 219
a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year. %$* 219
and by the way, as you know, tamar, the number of visas that are allowable for people to come here and work in the agricultural arena, h-2a, i believe, are unlimited. %$* 219
right there you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas. %$* 219
but they don't. %$* 222
you don't because-- %$* 219
i want to bring in-- %$* 13
just a moment. %$* 219
julián castro has not been heard from for more than four minutes, and i would like to - - which is rare for a politician. %$* 13
you don't have that because-- %$* 219
tom, let me-- %$* 13
more than four minutes, and you have. %$* 13
all right. %$* 219
okay. %$* 219
yeah, a few months ago, the census released its 2010 figures. %$* 220
and i believe that the population was somewhere around 308 million. %$* 220
and the number of illegal immigrants in our country has been pegged at 11 million. %$* 220
now, you know, almost half of those folks are not mexicans. %$* 220
and so this idea that somehow one and a half percent of this population of folks who are illegal, or even if you take three percent, are going to balkanize the united states of america is just absolutely ridiculous. %$* 220
in fact, i've seen in san antonio the effective generations of what has happened with the waves of hispanic immigrants. %$* 220
san antonio is now the seventh largest city in the united states, the second largest city in texas. %$* 220
it has a very robust local economy, so much so that during these last couple of years and forbes and others have ranked it as one of the most successful us cities. %$* 220
but julián, can you address-- %$* 13
and to a degree, your partner did. %$* 13
but the numbers that your opponent kris kobach brought out about the number of kids in public schools who are identifying as not american, do you think that's solely down to an anti-immigrant climate from the debate, because they obviously don't. %$* 13
i'd like to see what you think about that. %$* 13
well, first, i haven't seen that study. %$* 220
but secretary kobach said that that was from a san diego high school. %$* 220
the first thing is i would question the sample and the breadth of that study. %$* 220
i don't think that you can draw many conclusions from one high school in the united states, one class. %$* 220
but think about your own lives and the folks that you've met here in new york or wherever you've gone. %$* 220
folks are very proud to be americans. %$* 220
they came here for a reason. %$* 220
they came here to get ahead. %$* 220
they come here because of what america stands for. %$* 220
my experience has been that people very much identify themselves and are proud to be americans. %$* 220
just look at the names of the people who are fighting and dying in our wars. %$* 222
hispanics are a representative proportion to their proportion of the population. %$* 222
these are newcomers, and they're fighting and dying for us. %$* 222
here legally. %$* 221
kris kobach. %$* 13
he says they're not. %$* 18
here legally and are u.s. citizens-- %$* 221
yeah. %$* 18
primarily. %$* 221
but let me correct a number julián mentioned. %$* 221
kris kobach. %$* 13
the census bureau, the actual number, you’re right, 308 million total people residing in america, approximately 36 million are aliens, and that includes legal and illegal. %$* 221
so it's about 12 percent-- %$* 221
well, here you go-- %$* 220
of the population. %$* 221
and that is basically-- %$* 221
kris, i mean, you're switching between legal and illegal and making some arguments only for legal. %$* 220
okay, here, look. %$* 221
it's 11.1-- %$* 221
11.-- %$* 221
you can't have it both ways. %$* 220
that's the point. %$* 220
million is illegal. %$* 221
you do the math. %$* 221
that is a good question. %$* 222
are you guys against just illegal immigration, or are you against immigration, period? %$* 222
i'm telling you what we are in favor of is increasing the percentage of aliens who are exactly the ones you're talking about, the job creators, the entrepreneurs that are starting the companies. %$* 221
the way you increase that percentage is you reduce illegal immigration to zero, and you change our priorities about legal immigration, and you give higher preference to people who are skilled. %$* 221
and who-- %$* 222
we can accept the cream of the crop, and we should. %$* 221
and who's going to grow our food? %$* 222
and who's going to take care of our old people? %$* 222
and who's going to work in hospitals? %$* 222
well, the 14 million unemployed americans would be a starter. %$* 221
okay. %$* 13
i'd like to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
and the way that this works, the lights will come up, and if you raise your hand, i'll find you, and then a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
we'd like you to stand up so that the camera can find you. %$* 13
really, if you could keep your question to one sentence or two sentences, i mean, try to formulate it-- %$* 13
i'm okay with a brief statement of premise, but we would like to keep it terse. %$* 13
and hold the mic about a fist's distance from your mouth. %$* 13
and this gentleman in the front row in a blue shirt? %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
yes. %$* 18
actually, the mayor of new york city, michael bloomberg, he's been talking a lot about an immigration policy that will allow a lot more individuals to come in from all different classes, but that would be focused on having these immigrants come in a little bit more quickly, a little bit easier if they would agree to stay in cities that are necessarily in decline like detroit for a period of two to three years, five years. %$* 18
i'm just curious. %$* 18
does that change any positions on either side? %$* 18
and could that be a viable plan that could maybe bring-- %$* 18
so he’s saying there is a place. %$* 13
kris kobach, do you want to-- %$* 13
mayor of detroit has already responded to that, i think. %$* 219
yeah, mayor bloomberg, you notice he didn't suggest that the illegal aliens come to any particular borough of new york. %$* 221
and the citizens of detroit weren't asked whether-- %$* 221
you know, they're facing unemployment-- %$* 221
whether they would like a large number of unskilled folks to come in and help revive their economy by taking a job they're already - - %$* 221
julián castro. %$* 13
okay, tamar jacoby then julián. %$* 13
you can make light of this, but i mean, it's true. %$* 222
go to any immigrant neighborhood, they revitalize the neighborhoods. %$* 222
they open shops. %$* 222
they open restaurants. %$* 222
they've taken burnt out neighborhoods across the country and revitalized them on the same way they create small businesses, and they're-- %$* 222
and they're consumers. %$* 222
yes, i don't know if we really want to send them all to detroit. %$* 222
but the truth is immigrants bring economic vitality, and they create jobs. %$* 222
julián castro. %$* 13
he's on to something. %$* 222
first, as i said earlier, the studies have shown that immigrants as a class have a higher rate of founding businesses than native born u.s. votes. %$* 220
mayor bloomberg is correct, and that's why he has made the economic argument very powerfully for both more legal immigration and then doing something with the 11 million folks who are here illegally. %$* 220
it is not realistic that you're going to deport 11 million people because it would decimate the american economy and because-- %$* 220
and this isn't about dollars and cents, but because these people are human beings. %$* 220
they're human beings. %$* 220
tom tancredo, do you want to weigh in on this? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 219
what our opponents have done here is very skillful, really great at it, and i give them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments, you know, that if you are opposed to immigration, you don't understand that some people who are coming here are patriots and want to be-- %$* 219
well, of course, it's absolutely true. %$* 219
nobody's suggesting that every single immigrant comes here under that premise. %$* 219
but the idea that you-- %$* 219
when you say you can't deport, i don't have any-- %$* 219
i have never once, in as many millions of words as i have expended on this topic, suggested everybody's got to be deported. %$* 219
all i've ever said is, look, all you have to do is obey the law. %$* 219
all you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is here illegally. %$* 219
people self-deport when that happens. %$* 219
it happened in arizona. %$* 219
you do not have to round people up. %$* 219
these are all cannards. %$* 219
these are all things that people on the other say to make it look as though we're all people who are just waiting and biding our time until we can get these people out of our country. %$* 219
that's-- %$* 219
your policy is even worse than deportation. %$* 222
why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with-- %$* 219
tamar jacoby. %$* 13
the immigration problem? %$* 219
how do you-- %$* 219
what's the deal? %$* 219
the theory behind this policy-- %$* 222
the theory behind the policy that tom tancredo and kris kobach are advocates for is called attrition through enforcement. %$* 222
it's, let's make immigrants' lives so miserable that they go home of their own accord. %$* 222
first of all, it doesn't work. %$* 222
many immigrants who are here, the unauthorized immigrants, are people who have been here for five years, 10 years, 20 years, who own homes, who own businesses, who are married to legal americans. %$* 222
they have citizen children. %$* 222
you might get a few to go home. %$* 222
but most are not going to go home. %$* 222
and honestly, i don't think that's how we want to deal with this population. %$* 222
these are people who we said, "nudge, nudge, wink, wink, come on in. %$* 222
do some work for us.” %$* 222
don't say "we." %$* 18
and now we're saying, let's make their lives so miserable that-- %$* 222
does it work, kris kobach? %$* 13
it will drive them home. %$* 222
i don't think that's the way to deal with that. %$* 222
statistically-- %$* 221
statistically, attrition through enforcement works. %$* 221
and it's basically the idea. %$* 221
it's the same law enforcement approach you have. %$* 221
you have a section of highway 95 where there are no police officers patrolling. %$* 221
you don't say, well, the only options are to have an amnesty, i.e., have no speed limit, or to catch 100 percent of the speeders. %$* 221
no. %$* 221
which would mean to-- %$* 221
but kris, i don't want our eyes to glaze over with the answer. %$* 13
okay. %$* 221
but when you say-- %$* 13
when you say statistically, can you give us a sense of what you mean? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 221
we have the numbers. %$* 221
arizona, more than any other state, has tried to encourage people to leave. %$* 221
give disincentives. %$* 221
take away public benefits. %$* 221
from middle of 2008 to middle of 2009, the overall illegal alien population in the united states dropped seven percent. %$* 221
arizona-- %$* 222
in arizona, in dropped 18 percent, more than double the national average. %$* 221
but most of them didn't go home. %$* 222
the only difference was the enforcement. %$* 221
but most of them didn't go home. %$* 222
they went to other neighboring states right next to-- %$* 222
then why did the mexican-- %$* 221
why did the mexicans – why did the mexican state of sonora %$* 221
that proves their point, though. %$* 13
you want to get out of arizona. %$* 13
that's true, but it does make the point that they %$* 222
why did president-- %$* 221
many of these people anymore. %$* 222
mexico, they’ve been out of mexico for 10 or 15 or more years, they're married to americans, they have citizen children, mexico's not home anymore. %$* 222
they leave and go to oklahoma. %$* 222
okay. %$* 13
i'm getting in my ear to go to some more questions and there's a woman in the fourth row, and thank you. %$* 13
good evening, everyone. %$* 19
i just want to start out quoting another nobel laureate, it was elie wiesel who said in the ’80s, who in documented immigrants gave the slogan, “no human being is illegal.” and i think that's a really brilliant place from which to start because sometimes we see that our laws have inhumane consequences. %$* 19
but my question is for kris kobach, how do you explain working for a designated hate group, the federation for american immigration reform, founded by white nationalist john tanton, who was recently profiled in the new york times? %$* 19
how do you explain the hate speech? %$* 19
okay, i'm-- %$* 13
you two can talk afterwards. %$* 13
it's not on our-- %$* 13
and i'm not disrespecting the question or its validity or the conversation you two can have afterwards, it's not on our topic. %$* 13
i'd like to answer one her points, though. %$* 221
the designation, by the way, is by the southern poverty law center which designates lots of people lots of things, but the bit about no human being being illegal, the reason i use the term "illegal alien" or "alien unlawfully present in the united states," is those are the terms used by federal law, and being a lawyer, i try to use the terms used by law. %$* 221
the word "undocumented immigrant" does not appear anywhere in the entire united states code. %$* 221
okay. %$* 13
the term "undocumented worker" does not appear. %$* 221
we take the point. %$* 13
i thought i saw a hand. %$* 13
sir, with the yellow tie, goldish, i'm not that good on the colors. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
i noticed that mr. %$* 18
kobach is a professor of constitutional law, and yet he's advocating that states have their own immigration policy. %$* 18
do you not understand the constitution you're trying to teach? %$* 18
i understand that perfectly well. %$* 221
i understand it perfectly well and-- %$* 221
i'm again close to saying do you want to take this? %$* 13
i'd love to take it, because, yeah. %$* 221
i think he does. %$* 13
because these questions really are a lot of fun-- %$* 221
i’ve got-- %$* 221
but-- %$* 221
now, let me just-- %$* 221
we've got people here who have committed to really making arguments on the issue. %$* 13
let me try to make this interesting because that's what a constitutional law professor does. %$* 221
really fast. %$* 13
really, no, the question-- %$* 221
the doctrine you're talking about is preemption doctrine. %$* 221
that is the idea that some things that congress can only do and some things that they-- %$* 221
and the states can do alongside congress. %$* 221
the united states supreme court last opined on this in 1976 about a california immigration law and said, yes, the states can do things to discourage illegal immigration. %$* 221
there is a case before the united states supreme court right now, whiting versus chamber of commerce, we should have a decision within the next month or so, this will be the first time the supreme court has spoken in 35 years. %$* 221
so the precedents are very clearly there, and that's why many of these cases, the states and cities are winning. %$* 221
okay, can i ask-- %$* 13
just in phrasing the questions to restrain the tendency to want to attack the, you know, ad hominem-- %$* 13
please? %$* 13
because it-- %$* 13
i know you can take it but it’s not what we want to do. %$* 13
if you stand up. %$* 13
oh no, no, no, you've got to get to a microphone first. %$* 13
can you hear me? %$* 19
no, no, you get a mic .yeah, wow. %$* 13
even the radio listeners could hear you on that one. %$* 13
you have been tossing around this statistic about 11 million immigrants, illegal immigrants in this country and then you tossed something in about it dropped, you know, so many percentages, what illegal immigrant is telling you that he’s illegal? %$* 19
and where are these statistics coming from? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
it's really interesting, the census has what’s called a current population survey and they do these every month and they do a really big one in march. %$* 221
and they actually give them to everybody and illegal aliens answer these surveys. %$* 221
and so they’re based on very large surveys done by the census bureau. %$* 221
and those numbers, the 11.3 million, those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the pew center and by the center for immigration studies so i think there’s broad agreement-- %$* 221
no, i'm just going to say the same thing. %$* 222
same thing, you agree on something? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
something technical, we agree on something technical. %$* 222
it's very technical. %$* 13
you have a white collar and i believe gray shirt-- %$* 13
oh, it’s a white collared gray shirt. %$* 13
earlier the mayor made a point that if you look into the future and you treat not just the snapshot of the economy but actually the dynamic picture of the economy, you see immigrants not just as one person, but as a pyramid of people who can contribute to the economy over many generations. %$* 18
why do you folks on the pro side of this question always look at the snapshot and never at the long term picture? %$* 18
interesting question. %$* 13
because i think, you know-- %$* 18
if many of the people in this room, if our immigrant descendants had come here now you would send them home. %$* 18
but in fact over the many generations we’ve contributed to this cause. %$* 18
tom tancredo. %$* 13
i think i at least attempted to address that when i spoke earlier when i talked about these periods of timeout. %$* 219
in fact, we have had immigrants-- %$* 219
immigration is an important part of america. %$* 219
there is nothing-- %$* 219
there is no argument about that. %$* 219
it’s just that it was rational over american history to create an immigration policy that fit the time, that fit the economic situation in the country. %$* 219
that’s exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 1900s, massive immigration, low-skilled people. %$* 219
fine, worked, it’s okay. %$* 219
and so you can say over a long period of time, it worked. %$* 219
well, it would work again today except that we have never had this timeout. %$* 219
and we continue to bring in the same category, low-skilled, low-wage worker, even though we don’t have enough jobs. %$* 219
okay, that’s an argument that has a logic to it, and, sir, i just want to know what your-- %$* 13
we need a mic back to you, and briefly, if you can rise again. %$* 13
did you hear it? %$* 13
yeah, i don’t think that really answers the question. %$* 18
the question, again, is why are we looking only at a snapshot and not at the full intergenerational contribution that immigrants and their families make? %$* 18
okay, he’s really saying why is it-- %$* 13
why are you not saying that 30 years from now, those folks that are here now, and you’re saying in an inappropriate time could not actually end up contributing. %$* 13
i think that’s what you’re saying, it’s a dynamic thing. %$* 13
what do we-- %$* 219
30 years from now, could things be better? %$* 219
yeah. %$* 219
i mean, who’s supposed to be able to make that determination? %$* 219
and why would we begin to think about creating-- %$* 219
exacerbating a problem we have today, a massive problem, with unemployment in this country-- %$* 219
10, well, nobody knows the real percentage. %$* 219
well, let’s settle on what’s generally talked about as the real unemployment in america, at 10 percent-- %$* 219
why would we tell all those people who are unemployed today, that they’re going to have to figure out a way to think about their lives as being better in the long run because they can’t get a job today. %$* 219
okay, tamar jacoby. %$* 13
i mean, it makes no sense. %$* 219
tamar jacoby. %$* 13
the problem with your arguments-- %$* 222
with our opponents’ arguments about integration and assimilation is they’re all based on hypotheticals. %$* 222
there’s no timeout. %$* 222
there was a timeout in the past. %$* 222
there’s too much welfare, that we didn’t have so much welfare in the past. %$* 222
but you’re not looking at the empirical evidence of whether today’s immigrants are integrating, and they are. %$* 222
99.9 percent of the children are learning english. %$* 222
even in the first generation, the home ownership rates and the wealth accumulation rise to americans of similar background. %$* 222
they’re owning homes. %$* 222
they’re starting businesses. %$* 222
they fighting our wars, and they’re integrating. %$* 222
okay, i’m hearing from tom tancredo. %$* 13
he’s disagreeing with your points down the line. %$* 13
almost every single study on this-- %$* 219
this is one of the-- %$* 219
another area where there is some degree of agreement in the number of studies out there. %$* 219
hispanic immigrants in america-- %$* 219
although hispanics make economic and educational gains from the first to the second generation, not disputed, the progress stops there. %$* 219
third-generation hispanics still earn significantly less than whites, graduate from college at less than 50 percent of whites, and, by the way, in terms of language, still do not accept english as the primary language, even at the third generation. %$* 219
that’s just not true. %$* 222
that’s just not accurate. %$* 220
come on. %$* 220
well, that’s-- %$* 219
okay. %$* 219
so we have another argument about statistics. %$* 219
john donvan: we have an impasse on that. %$* 219
there’s a-- %$* 219
ma’am in the third row. %$* 219
yeah, there’s a-- %$* 219
if you look to your left, that mic’s closer. %$* 219
and if you could stand, thanks. %$* 219
hi, i’m-- %$* 19
could you-- %$* 13
would you mind standing up for the camera? %$* 13
thanks so much. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 19
i’m wondering whether the premise should be concentrating on immigrants. %$* 19
why are we not-- %$* 19
for job losses-- %$* 19
first of all, legal or illegal, why are we not concentrating on companies that export the jobs into the third world or the companies like ge that are allowed to take their disbursements and costing this country-- %$* 19
okay, i-- %$* 13
no, but it has to do with immigrants because it is not about-- %$* 19
it’s pennywise and pound foolish. %$* 19
i agree, i agree. %$* 13

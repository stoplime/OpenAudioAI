i’d like to introduce robert rosenkranz, who is chairman of the rosenkranz foundation which is the sponsor of intelligence squared and he will frame tonight’s debate. %$* 33
bob. %$* 33
thank you, robert. %$* 1
thank you very much, and welcome. %$* 1
well, my task this evening is to frame tonight’s debate, and i frankly find it a bit challenging. %$* 1
unlike most of our debates, which speak to policy, this one is about facts. %$* 1
islam has some one and a half billion adherents. %$* 1
muslims in america seem quite well integrated into our society. %$* 1
arabs account for only twenty-five percent of all muslims. %$* 1
the majority are found throughout asia. %$* 1
but the radical islamic movement in the arab world, their doctrines of jihad, holy war, their tactics of terror – that’s what sort of shapes our view. %$* 1
well, is this view distorted? %$* 1
the polling data is not reassuring. %$* 1
consider the following examples. %$* 1
in pakistan, indonesia, morocco and egypt between seventy-three percent and ninety-two percentbelieve that the u.s.goal is definitely or probably to weaken and divide islam. %$* 1
in the same countries, only nine to twenty-three percent believe that the goal of the u.s.war on terror is to protect itself from terror attacks. %$* 1
in those countries, around twenty percent of those surveyed supported al qaeda’s attacks on americans and more than seventy percent agreed with such al qaeda goals as deterring u.s. support for israel pushing western values and western militaries out of islamic countries and affirming muslim dignity by standing up to america. %$* 1
and it’s astonishing to note that only between two and thirty-five percent of those polled identified al qaeda as behind the 9/11 attacks. %$* 1
in contrast, twenty to thirty-eight percent identified the u.s.or israel as the perpetrators of 9/11.and to end on a deeply confusing note, in egypt eighty-eight percent agree that groups like al qaeda that use violence against civilians are violating the principles of islam, yet sixty percent believe that suicide bombers are often or sometimes justified. %$* 1
well, what are we to make of all of this? %$* 1
from a geopolitical standpoint, are the radicals the only ones who matter? %$* 1
does their organization, intensity and violence effectively intimidate more moderate voices? %$* 1
are we engaged, in samuel huntington’s formulation, in a clash of civilizations? %$* 1
or is that precisely the characterization that the radicals hope to provoke? %$* 1
i’m confident that tonight’s panel can shed some light and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to our long-time radio host, and the host of npr’s all things considered – robert siegel. %$* 1
thank you, bob. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 33
and i’d like to welcome you to this, the ninth debate of the second intelligence squared u.s.series. %$* 33
the resolution that’s being debated tonight is: islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
and i’m going to give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 33
members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument. %$* 33
presentations are limited, strictly limited, to seven minutes each. %$* 33
when opening arguments are complete, i’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience, and after the q&a session, each debater will make a final two minute summation. %$* 33
and finally, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that’s attached to the armrest of your seat and i’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day. %$* 33
let’s begin, though, with a pre-debate vote. %$* 33
i’d like you to pick up the keypad that’s attached to the armrest on your left. %$* 33
and, for audience members sitting along the aisle to my right, your keypad is attached to the armrest on your right side, next to your neighbor’s. %$* 33
has everybody found their keypad? %$* 33
shall we take a vote on whether you’ve found your keypad? %$* 33
good. %$* 33
now, tonight’s resolution is: islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
after my prompt, press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion and three if you are undecided. %$* 33
you may begin voting now. %$* 33
and i will be informed of and reveal the results of your vote later in the evening. %$* 33
i’d like now to introduce the panel, and please hold your applause until all six of our panelists are introduced. %$* 33
for the motion, first, the vice-president at the foundation for defense of democracies, daveed gartenstein-ross; senior fellow in the center for religious freedom at the hudson institute, paul marshall; and professor in the practice of journalism at georgetown university school of continuing studies and former wall street journal reporter, asra nomani. %$* 33
against the motion, assistant professor of creative writing at the university of california, riverside, and fellow at the university of southern california center on public diplomacy, reza aslan; professor of history at columbia university, richard bulliet; and director of communications for the muslim public affairs council, edina lekovic. %$* 33
those are our six panelists. %$* 33
first, opening statements to be delivered from the podium and the order of presentation begins with paul marshall, speaking for the motion – seven minutes. %$* 33
with one minute left you’ll hear me say, “one,” which will be a warning. %$* 33
good. %$* 470
okay, thank you very much for inviting us all this evening and thank you for being here. %$* 470
we in favor of this motion argue that islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 470
what do we mean by radicals? %$* 470
we mean those who are striving for a political order representing a reactionary version of islam that denies legal and civic equality to men and women and also denies it on the basis of religion. %$* 470
it also denies freedom of speech and freedom of thought. %$* 470
we believe such trends, such people, currently dominate world islam. %$* 470
let us be quite clear about what we are not arguing. %$* 470
we are not arguing that islam itself is inherently radical. %$* 470
like any other movement, islam takes different forms at different times. %$* 470
also, we are not arguing that most muslims are radical. %$* 470
most are not. %$* 470
but what we are saying is that it is the radicals who have their hands on the levers of power. %$* 470
they are, to pick a word, the hegemonic. %$* 470
they’re the most powerful driving force. %$* 470
they’re tending to set the direction and shaping the future of islam in the modern world. %$* 470
they do this not because they have superior numbers, but because they are extremely focused in what they want. %$* 470
they’re clear about it. %$* 470
they are often well organized. %$* 470
they’re often very well funded, often by saudi arabia and they are very, very committed, being quite willing to often kill themselves and to kill other people, especially muslims. %$* 470
so this is what we’re arguing. %$* 470
to illustrate this i just want to show some of the trends which we have seen in the world in the last twenty-five to thirty years. %$* 470
some twenty-nine years ago, of the major muslim countries in the world only one-- %$* 470
saudi arabia - maintained that its political and constitutional order was a reflection of what it regards as original islam and that it has accepted no foreign or infidel accretions. %$* 470
saudi arabia was, and is, one of the world’s most repressive states. %$* 470
many, many examples could be given but i just mention one recent incident when three saudi intellectuals sent a petition to the king – a petition asking for a gradual move towards a constitutional government. %$* 470
they were charged with using – i quote – un-islamic terminology. %$* 470
the un-islamic terminology they used in their petition included the word human rights and democracy. %$* 470
so we have the situation of saudi some thirty years ago. %$* 470
then in february of 1979, the ayatollah komeini overthrows the shah and establishes a draconian regime in iran, which also since then has become one of the most repressive regimes in the world. %$* 470
it bars anybody who is not a muslim from having any authority over a muslim. %$* 470
it bars muslims who do not support the regime’s version of islam from running for political office. %$* 470
one other example: in iran, if you kill someone who is a member of one of the non-listed religions, non-recognized religions – say, such as the baha’is – there is no punishment. %$* 470
to kill a dog, a cat or a baha’i is the same thing. %$* 470
it is no matter of the law because they have no legal status. %$* 470
they do not religiously and politically exist. %$* 470
similarly, for sexual relations between a non-muslim man and a muslim woman, the penalty for the non-muslim is death. %$* 470
and of course, the penalty for homosexuals of whatever religion is death. %$* 470
a new proposed penal code has been presented to the iranian parliament which would institutionalize its current practice that it would require with no possibility of reprieve, annulment that the penalty for heresy or for apostasy-- %$* 470
leaving islam-- %$* 470
is death. %$* 470
article 112 of this, this penal code also emphasizes the law will be extraterritorial. %$* 470
this means, incidentally, if this law is in fact passed, under iranian law barack obama should be executed as an apostate. %$* 470
with the development of iran next door to them, the saudis redoubled their own efforts to export their own version of radical islam. %$* 470
they proclaim themselves, on many occasions, the muslim vatican-- %$* 470
a very un-muslim term-- %$* 470
and now, by most best estimates, spend some three billion dollars exporting their radical version of islam around the world. %$* 470
that’s somewhat more, that’s about three times as much as the soviet union used for ideological purposes at the height of its power. %$* 470
if one travels to a moderate muslim country, such as indonesia, or if you travel throughout africa, you will find saudi-funded mosques, imams, lectures, sermons, students, books, videos, fatwas propagating its own reactionary version of islam. %$* 470
the iranians seek to do the same. %$* 470
one result of this, though there are homegrown radical movements, with this organizational push behind them, one sees the growth of radical islam throughout the world. %$* 470
some examples: when pakistan was founded it was not founded – %$* 470
as an islamic country. %$* 470
the ali jinnah – the man who founded the country-- %$* 470
said, whether you’re a muslim or you’re a non- muslim is no matter of the state. %$* 470
but now they have introduced blasphemy laws, which include the death penalty, particularly used on religious minorities. %$* 470
in sudan, the government has instituted laws and propagated genocidal wars against the south in darfur, killing some two million and two hundred and fifty thousand, respectively. %$* 470
in nigeria, some fifty thousand people have died in conflict over the introduction of radical islam. %$* 470
we see this phenomena repeated throughout the world and one could give very many more examples. %$* 470
one sees it even in, growing in malaysia and indonesia – historically very moderate countries. %$* 470
one result is that in freedom house’s rankings of the world’s twenty un-free countries, the majority now are muslim. %$* 470
okay, the crucial confluence of ideas is not between the west and the muslim world – %$* 470
it is within the muslim world. %$* 470
thank you. %$* 470
one. %$* 33
as an islamic country. %$* 470
the ali jinnah – the man who founded the country-- %$* 470
said, whether you’re a muslim or you’re a non- muslim is no matter of the state. %$* 470
but now they have introduced blasphemy laws, which include the death penalty, particularly used on religious minorities. %$* 470
in sudan, the government has instituted laws and propagated genocidal wars against the south in darfur, killing some two million and two hundred and fifty thousand, respectively. %$* 470
in nigeria, some fifty thousand people have died in conflict over the introduction of radical islam. %$* 470
we see this phenomena repeated throughout the world and one could give very many more examples. %$* 470
one sees it even in, growing in malaysia and indonesia – historically very moderate countries. %$* 470
one result is that in freedom house’s rankings of the world’s twenty un-free countries, the majority now are muslim. %$* 470
paul marshall, thank you very much for your opening statement, in support of the motion-- %$* 33
okay, the crucial confluence of ideas is not between the west and the muslim world – %$* 470
islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
it is within the muslim world. %$* 470
thank you. %$* 470
thank you. %$* 33
now the first opening statement opposed to the motion: islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
the speaker is reza aslan. %$* 33
there is something peculiar about the way that this debate tonight is being worded. %$* 471
the idea that we could, from our comfortable perches here in manhattan, pass judgment on the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people in every corner of the world. %$* 471
and despite mr. %$* 471
marshall’s comments, we’re not here to talk about whether saudi arabia or iran is dominated by radicals. %$* 471
we’re here to talk about whether islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 471
so i suppose it’s not surprising that a large percentage of people in this room would believe that islam – unquestionably the most eclectic, the most diverse religion in the history of the world – is dominated by radicals. %$* 471
after all, no field work or research is necessary to come to such a conclusion – just turn on your television, watch your nightly news. %$* 471
now, of course, we’re not children in this room. %$* 471
we all recognize that the purpose of commercial news is to sell commercials – which, by the way, is why i only get my news from npr, robert. %$* 471
thank you, yes. %$* 33
and what sells commercials, of course, is violence and terror. %$* 471
you all know this. %$* 471
so then if there are violent protests about, let’s say, against deliberately provocative cartoons of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper, that’s a story. %$* 471
however, if a racist politician in the netherlands makes a movie – we’re talking about geert wilders here-- %$* 471
makes a movie comparing the koran to mein kampf and requesting its abolishment in the entire country and no protests erupt, the lack of protest is not a story. %$* 471
there is simply no story. %$* 471
similarly, if the pope makes some controversial comments about the prophet mohammed and there are mass protests on the street, that’s a story. %$* 471
if the pope goes to turkey and no mass protests erupt, it’s not that the lack of protests is a story. %$* 471
there is no story. %$* 471
and i can tell you because i was there with cnn. of course, much of this debate tonight – and in %$* 471
and indeed, much of the debate about islam in general is based not only on the media but on firsthand anecdotal evidence provided by, quote/unquote, insiders. %$* 471
and i’m sure you’ll hear plenty of that tonight from asra and daveed. %$* 471
how the experiences of the colleagues for the motion in confronting radicals in their own communities has given them the knowledge necessary to judge the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people, i’m not sure. %$* 471
i will say that if i based my views of catholicism on the stories that i hear from my former catholic friends and on the media reports about catholicism, i’d pretty much have to assume that catholicism is dominated by sadistic pederasts. %$* 471
but of course that’s not true. %$* 471
so then i suppose the real question here is why do we keep asking pundits and politicians and writers and public intellectuals what muslims think? %$* 471
why don’t we just simply ask muslims themselves? %$* 471
this is, after all, not so arduous a task. %$* 471
in fact, the gallop organization – the most trusted polling organization in the world-- %$* 471
has already done the work for us by conducting the largest, most comprehensive poll of the muslim world ever done. %$* 471
according to that poll, a mere seven percent of the world’s muslims – not arabs – seven percent of the world’s muslims believe that the attacks of 9/11 were justified. %$* 471
now, more interestingly, gallop went a little bit further and actually asked those seven percent why they believe the attacks were justified. %$* 471
and the responses fly in the face of conventional wisdom. %$* 471
for example, in indonesia – the largest muslim country in the world, and frankly, quite a pluralistic and successful democracy-- %$* 471
not a single respondent, not a single respondent in indonesia cited the koran as justification for the attacks of 9/11. indeed, seventy- four percent of indonesians, eighty-six percent of pakistanis, eighty-one percent of bangladeshis and eighty percent of iranians said that attacks against civilians were, quote, never justified-- %$* 471
never. %$* 471
now, please compare that to forty-six percent of americans who said the same. %$* 471
in fact, the gallop poll found that in all muslim countries the majority of those muslims who, quote/unquote, support violence or what we can refer to as radical views or tendencies do so for markedly secular – that is, political – reasons. %$* 471
robert pape found similar tendencies in his comprehensive study of suicide bombing. %$* 471
he found that ninety-five percent of all suicide terrorism is, quote, not driven by religion as much as by clear strategic – read, political – objectives. %$* 471
in short, when we talk about radicalism in the muslim world we are talking about political radicalism, which after all, in a globalized world is not that odd. %$* 471
why are these political goals so often couched in the language of religion – and in this case – %$* 471
the language of islam? %$* 471
well, it’s because in every society religion holds the most currency with the masses. %$* 471
in every society religion provides a powerful language to create simple collective identities and to urge collective action. %$* 471
in every society the language of religion has the power to distill the most complex sociopolitical issues into the simplest of choices – good versus evil, us versus them. %$* 471
as i say, this is true of every society, ours especially. %$* 471
and if you don’t believe me, i suggest you ask karl rove. %$* 471
thank you. %$* 471
one. %$* 33
the language of islam? %$* 471
well, it’s because in every society religion holds the most currency with the masses. %$* 471
in every society religion provides a powerful language to create simple collective identities and to urge collective action. %$* 471
in every society the language of religion has the power to distill the most complex sociopolitical issues into the simplest of choices – good versus evil, us versus them. %$* 471
as i say, this is true of every society, ours especially. %$* 471
and if you don’t believe me, i suggest you ask karl rove. %$* 471
thank you. %$* 471
thank you, reza aslan, for that opening statement. %$* 33
now, speaking in support of the motion: islam is dominated by radicals, asra nomani. %$* 33
so i would say assalamu alaykum to all of you, but according to the prayer book that i was handed when i went on the pilgrimage to saudi arabia, i’m not allowed to say this peaceful greeting to those who aren’t muslim. %$* 472
when i see that headline: islam is dominated by radicals, i don’t hesitate in believing it to be true. %$* 472
the opposite side wants to suggest that we can’t tell you stories from the trenches. %$* 472
but it is, in fact, in the trenches where we know what is happening, that we know that the radicals are, in fact, intimidating, silencing and paralyzing the moderates. %$* 472
i know it from my lifetime in the muslim community and i know it from stories and anecdotes, sure, and historical and country cases. %$* 472
when i was given this proposition i asked my mother – a grandmother, who has taught me my muslim prayers, who is teaching her grandchildren the prayers – i said, do you think that islam is dominated by radicals? %$* 472
you can dismiss her as an anecdote. %$* 472
you can dismiss her as somebody who isn’t pundit enough but she’s got her finger on the pulse of what’s going on in our communities. %$* 472
and she didn’t hesitate in saying yes. %$* 472
for the last thirty years that i have known, since the exportation of wahabiism from saudi arabia to the far reaches of our muslim world, i know that our community is dominated by radical ideology. %$* 472
i know that it is an ideology that has taken root in countries from pakistan to states in nigeria to provinces in indonesia with laws that put women in second class status, that give women criminal punishments because of sexual crimes. %$* 472
in each instance you could say that there’s a political purpose. %$* 472
but at the end of the day it is done in the name of islam. %$* 472
i don’t stand up here and condemn my faith. %$* 472
i fight for it every single day. %$* 472
i fight for a progressive interpretation of our faith. %$* 472
but at the end of the day our religion, our institutional islam out there in the world-- %$* 472
from my home town of morgantown, west virginia to islamabad, pakistan to indonesia to riyadh, saudi arabia – we are controlled and dominated by radical ideology. %$* 472
the moderates don’t want to lose their status. %$* 472
they don’t want to lose their place in the community. %$* 472
they don’t want to lose their invitation to the potluck dinner parties and wedding halls that they get to go to. %$* 472
it’s an issue of social dynamics. %$* 472
at the end of the day it isn’t worth it to them to take on the radical ideology because there’s too much at stake. %$* 472
you risk your own safety and then you risk your social standing. %$* 472
i know this as a woman in the faith. %$* 472
i know that what we are struggling with is a situation where more mosques in america than in the 1990s are putting women in separate sections. %$* 472
two-thirds of mosques in america versus half in the 1990s have women separated. %$* 472
and you could argue that that’s not radical ideology. %$* 472
but at the end of the day it is part of a continuum of an interpretation of islam that takes a literal read that says a woman is sexual temptation, that a woman is sexual distraction. %$* 472
you take that interpretation and it isn’t that long that you have to also add up to an interpretation that says that you can’t be friends with the jews and the christians, that violence is acceptable. %$* 472
why do i know this? %$* 472
because i’ve heard it from my pulpit. %$* 472
i’ve heard it from the sermons that are downloaded on college campuses across this country and across the world. %$* 472
there is an exportation of this ideology. %$* 472
we may watch our borders, we may check the visas of people who come into this country but i know that there is an ideology that says that a woman is half the witness of a man in criminal cases, that that is law in countries of our, of our religion, that there is interpretation that says that a woman gets less inheritance. %$* 472
when we put women-- %$* 472
half of our population, in particular-- %$* 472
in second class status around the world, you can call it anything you want. %$* 472
but i consider it unacceptable and i call it radical ideology. %$* 472
it’s unacceptable to have tradition become religion with female genital mutilation. %$* 472
it’s unacceptable to have honor killings, as we are, from canada to texas to turkey. %$* 472
you can call those anecdotes but it’s a trend. %$* 472
it’s a trend that’s happening because our islam of today is dominated by radicals. %$* 472
we don’t have mosque leaders who are keeping that kind of ideology in check. %$* 472
we are, in fact, having leaders who accept preaching from the pulpit that says that we cannot imitate the dis-believers, that we cannot say assalamu alaykum to those who are not muslim. %$* 472
at the end of the day what i want you to know is that i stand up for islam as a faith. %$* 472
i stand up for the principles just like every other religion. %$* 472
but like judaism and christianity have evolved so that there is a continuum in institutional religion, so that there is a reform synagogue along with the orthodox synagogue, our mosques are defined by an institutional puritanical interpretation that to me is very radical and very unacceptable. %$* 472
and i encourage you to vote to support this motion because we need a truth telling. %$* 472
we need to be honest. %$* 472
we need to not cower in the face of political correctness. %$* 472
a lot of you may have hesitation because you think that if you vote for the motion you are voting and condemning islam. %$* 472
i don’t stand here before you saying that that is at all on the table. %$* 472
we can stand up for religion that is not dominated by radicals, but we can accept the fact when it is. %$* 472
and in our day, in the trenches in the muslim world from a mosque just a few blocks away from here to seattle, washington to dubai, we are facing a momentum where the leadership is one that accepts radical ideology and the moderates don’t stand up against it. %$* 472
so i encourage you to vote for the motion and understand that it’s a vote for truth. %$* 472
thank you. %$* 472
one. %$* 33
we need to not cower in the face of political correctness. %$* 472
a lot of you may have hesitation because you think that if you vote for the motion you are voting and condemning islam. %$* 472
i don’t stand here before you saying that that is at all on the table. %$* 472
we can stand up for religion that is not dominated by radicals, but we can accept the fact when it is. %$* 472
and in our day, in the trenches in the muslim world from a mosque just a few blocks away from here to seattle, washington to dubai, we are facing a momentum where the leadership is one that accepts radical ideology and the moderates don’t stand up against it. %$* 472
so i encourage you to vote for the motion and understand that it’s a vote for truth. %$* 472
thank you. %$* 472
thank you, asra nomani. %$* 33
and now, an opening statement against the motion from edina lekovic. %$* 33
i will bid you assalamu alaykum, because that is what my faith teaches me and that, regardless of who is in the pulpit, is what the book teaches. %$* 473
when we consider the question of whether islam is dominated by radicals we have to look in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of prominence and in terms of symbols. %$* 473
saying that islam is dominated by radicals is much like saying, is as absurd as saying that america is dominated by murderers. %$* 473
certainly they exist within our society and certainly radicals exist within the fold of islam. %$* 473
but do they dominate? %$* 473
absolutely not. %$* 473
based on the polling data that reza shared with you and based on so much other data that exists out there, the people on the muslim streets, both in the west and in the, quote/unquote, muslim world, are striving for freedom, for freedom of speech, for democracy, for technology, for those very things that they admire the west for. %$* 473
that is what their faith is pushing them to do. %$* 473
now, islam is dominated, if you will, by scholars, by average people more so than anyone else, who are struggling to understand islam in a 21st century context and who seek to foster inclusion of muslims on the international stage and who want nothing more than to be understood and to be respected, as that same poll showed over and over again. %$* 473
to point to saudi arabia over and over again, i will hand that to the other side. %$* 473
saudi arabia is no, by no means the shining glory of any part of the muslim world. %$* 473
but pointing to pockets in no way reflects the overall picture, the overall reality. %$* 473
looking in a pocket or in many pockets in no way represents the overall cost to, the overall character of the people and it is the people who define the faith and who define their global community. %$* 473
the reality is that the moral – you know, when we look at where this radical threat lies-- %$* 473
i travel across this country and around the world. %$* 473
we can fight anecdotes with anecdotes. %$* 473
when i was in malaysia a few years ago talking to youth on the streets there, their single goal was to be understood. %$* 473
they wondered why americans didn’t understand them and why americans thought that they were all terrorists. %$* 473
when i traveled to egypt it was the same. %$* 473
when i traveled even to bosnia, to the former yugoslavia where my parents are from, it was very much the same. %$* 473
the lack of understanding on both sides of the issue has in many ways been fueled by media perceptions as we have described here earlier. %$* 473
the reality on the ground is this: radicals are failing in their attempt to dominate. %$* 473
radicals, those who make up al qaeda and its various branches, are on the run. %$* 473
they are in decline. %$* 473
their messages are not reaching the audiences that they seek to convert and to brainwash as much as they used to. %$* 473
and that, to me, is an important symbol of the rise of moderation, the rise of the middle, the rise of those who dominate this faith. %$* 473
even those in al qaeda – ayman al-zawahiri, who recently released a tape – they have had to change their tactics because they are receiving criticism from within the muslim community. %$* 473
they have had to respond to criticism about targeting civilians and have had to answer these questions to the very people that they are trying to recruit. %$* 473
and if we look even at the reality in the, quote/unquote-- %$* 473
and i say again, quote/unquote-- %$* 473
muslim world, look even to pakistan, where we saw that the radicals indeed killed bhutto. %$* 473
but what did the people do in response? %$* 473
they elected a secular government. %$* 473
they responded in a different way. %$* 473
the people on the ground are the ones who are defining the face and the nature and the character of the faith and of the global muslim community. %$* 473
and again, what do they want? %$* 473
that’s what we have to remember. %$* 473
they do not want death and destruction. %$* 473
they want hope, they want economic ability, they want education and they want a seat at the table. %$* 473
if we also look to the, where the war against radicals is taking place, it’s almost entirely in the islamic world, between mainstream societies and governments on the one hand and radical minorities on the other hand. %$* 473
just look at what muslim scholars and muslim leaders have been able to achieve in the last few years and then we’ll ask ourselves, why haven’t we heard about it? %$* 473
in 2005 jordan’s king abdullah convened an international islamic conference of two hundred of the world’s most leading islamic scholars from fifty different countries. %$* 473
those scholars unanimously issued a ruling on three fundamental issues – the validity of all interpretations of islam, the eight legal schools. %$* 473
they forbade the declaration of apostasy between muslims and they further provided pre-conditions to issuing fatwas, since they have become such a currency on the international market and have lost their meaning entirely. %$* 473
that’s one example. %$* 473
another is that a hundred and thirty-eight muslim scholars joined together to affirm freedom of expression-- %$* 473
scholars from around the world – and to condemn the negative reactions to the danish cartoons – and which resulted, i think, interestingly, of the fact that there was very little, if – very little reaction to the most recent danish, episode, if you will, of the film fitna. %$* 473
and those same scholars reached out to the pope to establish a historic muslim/catholic forum %$* 473
seeking opportunities for dialogue that they could do on an international scale at the level of leadership and that could also be modeled for their citizens and their countries and for the faithful among them who wanted to see something different take place. %$* 473
internationally recognized leaders are calling for integration, for tolerance and for advancement. %$* 473
and their reach is ten times wider at least than that of al qaeda or any of their associates. %$* 473
just consider those, even in turkey, which has recently elected a new government but has taken the lead in ushering in a historic re-examining of islamic material to cater to the contemporary world. %$* 473
that is just one among countless examples of people who are working day in, day out to re-emerge as the dominant force within their faith and who are crying out for attention on the world stage. %$* 473
just consider this last example, which is that, what – %$* 473
where do the cameras turn? %$* 473
that’s the question. %$* 473
precisely. %$* 473
right. %$* 473
sure— %$* 473
absolutely, but let’s consider also where that comes from, let’s consider the kind of us support that saudi arabia also gets in, you know, in reciprocity. %$* 473
now in no way  %$* 473
do i place any sort of validity or endorsement on the saudi ideology. %$* 473
is it out there, are there’s korans out there that we fight problems with, absolutely. %$* 473
but even the saudi people would disagree in large part with what their government is doing, and there is no foundation whatsoever for the kinds of, you know, of distorted perceptions of faith that they’re spreading on the ground. %$* 473
and that in no way represents the global reality of islam. %$* 473
again, looking at pockets and trying to turn them into global realities, we have to recognize and reinforce the majority. %$* 473
so that is—and that’s precisely what has happened since 9-11 which is the point that i was trying to make, that’s where the reemergence is taking place. %$* 473
one. %$* 33
seeking opportunities for dialogue that they could do on an international scale at the level of leadership and that could also be modeled for their citizens and their countries and for the faithful among them who wanted to see something different take place. %$* 473

just consider this last example, which is that, what – %$* 473
i’m sorry. %$* 33
we’ll have to hear the last example later. %$* 33
thank you very much. %$* 33
where do the cameras turn? %$* 473
that’s the question. %$* 473
edina lekovic. %$* 33
thank you, edina lekovic, for that statement in support of the motion: islam is dominated by radicals. %$* 33
a couple of questions from me. %$* 33
quickly, first for paul marshall. %$* 33
uh, if, as you argue, uh, islam is dominated by radicals, uh, why aren’t indonesia, malaysia, bangladesh, uh, uh, or for that matter, hundreds—tens of millions of muslims in india, all knuckling unto, uh, under to jihadist movements, and creating islamic revolutions in those country, why don’t—why haven’t we seen more islamic revolutions. %$* 33
because most muslims don’t like the radicals’ agenda. %$* 470
but— %$* 470
they’re not dominated by it— %$* 33
precisely. %$* 473
well, no, i think if people have guns, if they have intim—if they intimidate people, if they’re organized, if they have funding, if one sees even in indonesia the increase in radical movements, radical islam— radical imams, who were not there 10, 20, 15 years ago. %$* 470
when you see in indonesia the destruction of hundreds of churches, where 10 years in indonesia, 20 years ago you wouldn’t— would never have seen that, people coexisted. %$* 470
so even in places like indonesia, in places like bangladesh, in places like malaysia, even though most of the people don’t want it, you have the growth of radical movements, and they often win, because they intimidate and scare other people— %$* 470
paul marshall— %$* 471
okay, more— %$* 33
paul marshall knows that those churches are primarily chinese- owned, and the chinese form a socioeconomic community in indonesia that has been at great odds with the majority muslim population there and that a lot of those churches are not religious violence. %$* 471
it’s ethnic, social violence, but more importantly, again, you know, here we go, we’re—we’re talking about this idea of, of domination— %$* 471
by the way, most of the churches are non-ethnic chinese. %$* 470
the majority of christians in indonesia are chinese. %$* 471
are of chinese ethnicity— %$* 471
and you— %$* 470
it is— %$* 471
that laskar jihad does not justify its attacks that way, it, it’s— %$* 470
no, no, of course not— %$* 471
—it’s just not a general religious war against christians— %$* 470
but lots of—but again they don’t dominate— %$* 471
it’s just the primary group responsible for, for that violence— %$* 470
but that’s the point—is that, they do not dominate either the discussion about islam in indonesia, or the society of indonesia or the government, we’re talking— there’s one country in the world— %$* 471
i agree with you and edina that they don’t dominate the discussions, the conferences, when people— %$* 470
then what do they dominate— %$* 471
—get together— %$* 470
right. %$* 473
—but those don’t have much effect. %$* 470
no, what, what— %$* 471
the people— people with professors, every time. %$* 470
what do they dominate— %$* 471
they dominate actions. %$* 472
what i thought was really— %$* 472
asra nomani— %$* 33
—interesting—what i thought was really interesting was that, edina, you even talked about the moderates reemerging as the dominant force in the faith, an acknowledgement that they are not the dominant faith— %$* 472
—i want to hear edina answer the question from asra nomani— %$* 33
i would like to just make the point that, talk is great to point out, this is not a popularity contest of what muslims mostly think. %$* 472
i mean this is about our institutional faith, if you ask me. %$* 472
when we talk about whether islam is dominated by radicals, domination to me is, do they have leadership in our communities, and are they taking action that is representative of a violent strain of islam and i’d say yes. %$* 472
asra nomani, thanks, and edina lekovic— let me ask you a specific question— %$* 33
sure— %$* 473
—by the way you spoke of saudi arabia as a pocket that we shouldn’t take as representative any more than murderers in america should be representative of american life. %$* 33
wouldn’t you concede that the role of saudi arabia, and iran for that matter, on the global stage, is far disproportionate to their numerical position in islam, they have influence beyond their own borders, right— %$* 33
absolutely, but let’s consider also where that comes from, let’s consider the kind of us support that saudi arabia also gets in, you know, in reciprocity. %$* 473
but what does— %$* 472
now in no way  %$* 473
do i place any sort of validity or endorsement on the saudi ideology. %$* 473
is it out there, are there’s korans out there that we fight problems with, absolutely. %$* 473
but even the saudi people would disagree in large part with what their government is doing, and there is no foundation whatsoever for the kinds of, you know, of distorted perceptions of faith that they’re spreading on the ground. %$* 473
and that in no way represents the global reality of islam. %$* 473
again, looking at pockets and trying to turn them into global realities, we have to recognize and reinforce the majority. %$* 473
so that is—and that’s precisely what has happened since 9-11 which is the point that i was trying to make, that’s where the reemergence is taking place. %$* 473
we have much more to come, we still have two opening statements yet to hear, and we’re going to resume those now, speaking for the motion, “islam is dominated by radicals,” is daveed gartenstein-ross. %$* 33
daveed. %$* 33
it’s important before you cast your vote in this debate to think carefully about the resolution, and to think carefully about the way that we defined it. %$* 474
as we said in our very first speech, we support the proposition that islam is dominated by radicals, and we define radicalism in relation to human equality. %$* 474
in the muslim world, is there belief in equality between religions? %$* 474
is there belief in equality between genders? %$* 474
is there support for basic freedoms, like freedom of speech, and freedom of religion? %$* 474
the other side has not addressed these issues. %$* 474
instead they’ve changed the subject, speech after speech, and defined this resolution only with respect to violence. %$* 474
there’s a reason that in neither of our previous two speeches, did we talk about violence, i’ll talk about it a little bit here because they’re bringing it up. %$* 474
but they haven’t refuted any of our basic arguments about how human equality is not being met in the muslim world. %$* 474
we’ve talked about it in two different ways, we’ve talked about equality in terms of freedom of religion, and we’ve talked about equality of gender and they’ve said not one word on it. %$* 474
their last speech, i have to say, is a little late to do so. %$* 474
the reason this is important, is because we need to understand the severity of the problem. %$* 474
the reason we need to understand this, is because, if, in fact, the muslim world is dominated by moderates and neo-progressives who are going to usher in a new era of prosperity and freedom, then there’s not much that we in the west need to do about it. %$* 474
but if on the other hand, radicals are ascendant, then we need to play a bigger role, and we need to put greater emphasis on this corner of the world. %$* 474
so the way we think about it fundamentally matters, and it matters to those who are suffering under totalitarian systems. %$* 474
now, look at the key areas of the debate. %$* 474
look at freedom of religion. %$* 474
this is something that affects people. %$* 474
in 14 muslim countries, right now, it is illegal to change your religion, in eight of these countries, it is punishable by death. %$* 474
that is, you cannot convert out of islam in these countries. %$* 474
that does not support equality between religions. %$* 474
this is supported also, by anti-proselytism laws, laws that prevent people from other faiths from propagating their own faiths, while at the same time saudi money goes out throughout the entire globe, propagating a wahabist version of islam. %$* 474
this also is supported by anti-blasphemy laws. %$* 474
laws that are used to suppress people who have a view of religion that does not conform with the very stringent view that a state might have. %$* 474
now they have a couple of arguments here. %$* 474
one argument they made is polls. %$* 474
now unfortunately, their argument about the polls which is trying to give you a broader view, only deals with violence. %$* 474
well let’s talk about polling a little bit. %$* 474
one recent poll, by policy exchange that was undertaken in britain back in 2006 shows that a shocking 36 percent of british muslims between the ages of 16 and 24, said that someone who converts from islam to another faith, should be punished by death. %$* 474
that’s within the west, you get a 36 percent support for this. %$* 474
now, 36 percent obviously is not a majority. %$* 474
but what it shows, is the hegemony, as we framed it, of radicals, the fact that these ideas are seeping into the west, where people are familiar with western customs, western freedoms, and have had a chance to live in them. %$* 474
now, the odd—but, and another thing about the polls incidentally, is they’re not necessarily as benign as the other side makes them out to be. %$* 474
for example, a recent poll conducted by pew found that 15 percent of indonesians support—believe that violence in defense of islam is justified. %$* 474
well 15 percent isn’t a whole lot. %$* 474
but when you look at indonesia which is the world’s most populous muslim country, you’re talking about 25 million people. %$* 474
i find that number to be a bit disturbing. %$* 474
and it’s out of line with what you’d find comparably christians saying, in terms of whether defense of their faith is justified, whether violence is justified, in terms of defense of christianity. %$* 474
now, that is relevant to assessing whether this resolution is correct. %$* 474
now, moving on to other arguments that they made, edina says, don’t look at pockets, people define the faith. %$* 474
well that’s non- responsive, because from the very first speech onward, we have said, that the majority of muslims do not support radicalism. %$* 474
rather, it’s that radicals enjoy hegemony, via institutions, via the propagation of the faith. %$* 474
and edina actually gives up the game in her speech, because she concedes that saudi arabia is radical. %$* 474
remember, folks, we’re not talking about al qaeda here. %$* 474
the question is not whether muslims support al qaeda, it’s not whether al qaeda has hegemony, it’s radicals. %$* 474
and saudi arabia today, is the biggest country in terms of propagating a view of islam. %$* 474
and one reason that reza, uh, feared that i might talk about my view from the trenches, is that in a previous incarnation before i was in counterterrorism, i was working for a saudi arabian charity and actually got somewhat radicalized by them, it’s in—in a book that you can read somewhere or other. %$* 474
but the point is that, i’ve seen saudi propaganda from the inside. %$* 474
and saudi propaganda does take root. %$* 474
if you look at countries— and this is something that paul talked about in the very first speech. %$* 474
if you look at countries from bosnia to indonesia to somalia, countries that for a long time had a very moderate practice of islam. %$* 474
as saudi money has gone in there, and as you’ve had these institutions, these mosques, these charitable organizations, the practice of islam has fundamentally shifted. %$* 474
things are not gonna get better on their own. %$* 474
because, look at the price of oil. %$* 474
saudi arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of oil, in addition to the being the world’s biggest exporter of radical ideology. %$* 474
and the price of oil is skyrocketing. %$* 474
over $100 a barrel, you have hugo chavez and others talking about how it should be $200 a barrel. %$* 474
that’s not unrealistic. %$* 474
and with this power, with this oil money, you’ll see these radical ideas continue to take shape. %$* 474
saudi arabia is a powerful country. %$* 474
in conceding that saudi arabia is radical, they fundamentally concede that this debate is not about al qaeda. %$* 474
it’s about the radical institutions. %$* 474
and those radical institutions are indeed taking foot. %$* 474
she says look at the muslim scholars. %$* 474
she says that they affirm freedom of expression, and condemned the riots over the danish cartoons. %$* 474
but look at what the organization of the islamic conference did, the oic. in response to the danish cartoons, they— %$* 474
—pushed for a ban in the un.they said that there should be a new law to prevent cartoons like that coming up ever again. %$* 474
these are cartoons that were published in the west. %$* 474
and the islamic countries believe that it’s their right to make sure that the west alters its precept of free speech, to conform with norms that would be more suitable. %$* 474
that is why we’re saying, that radicals have hegemonic power, and that’s why you should vote for this resolution. %$* 474
one. %$* 33
—pushed for a ban in the un.they said that there should be a new law to prevent cartoons like that coming up ever again. %$* 474
these are cartoons that were published in the west. %$* 474
and the islamic countries believe that it’s their right to make sure that the west alters its precept of free speech, to conform with norms that would be more suitable. %$* 474
that is why we’re saying, that radicals have hegemonic power, and that’s why you should vote for this resolution. %$* 474
thank you, daveed gartenstein-ross, for that opening statement in support of the motion and now speaking against the motion, “islam is dominated by radicals,” richard bulliet. %$* 33
good evening. %$* 475
i think we can agree with most of what our opponents have said. %$* 475
just not with the proposition. %$* 475
we can agree that saudi arabia is not a place that most of us would particularly want to live. %$* 475

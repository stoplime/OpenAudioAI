and you have a high minimum wage. %$* 211
problem fixed. %$* 211
you can't-- %$* 212
you can't-- %$* 212
yes, you can do that. %$* 211
and then ron has demonstrated you can do that. %$* 211
if you your own partner here. %$* 211
i think you-- %$* 212
i think you then get into the arbitrage problem, you know. %$* 212
can you explain the term "arbitrage" for folks who don't get it? %$* 13
when somebody is basically taking the difference between a wage here and a wage there and creaming out part of it for their own benefit. %$* 212
this is what happens in international recruitment with these very high fees that are paid by-- %$* 212
ron, you need to respond to your partner. %$* 211
and the reason-- %$* 210
bryan caplan. %$* 13
why that's possible is precisely that it is not legal for them to go under most circumstances. %$* 210
no, this is-- %$* 212
these are legal workers. %$* 212
these are legal workers. %$* 212
under most circumstances, most-- %$* 210
there are very few jobs in sweden where someone would want to hire someone from another country if they're low skilled precisely because the regulations are so strict. %$* 210
again, remember, the whole point of ron's proposal is to price out most people on earth from the u.s. labor market. %$* 210
he says this. %$* 210
so when you talk about the poor conditions of workers of other countries. %$* 210
remember, ron's proposal is designed to keep them poor at home. %$* 210
is that true, ron? %$* 13
that's not-- %$* 213
that's not true. %$* 213
well, not really. %$* 210
in other words, again, it's a very simple issue. %$* 213
it's a very simple issue. %$* 213
when you have billions of workers legally able to come to the united states and take every-- %$* 213
any job they can that they're offered, you're really converting, again, the minimum wage into a maximum wage because basically very few people in the united states under those circumstances who do ordinary jobs would ever get paid more than the minimum wage. %$* 213
no, no. %$* 13
but you've already said that. %$* 13
his question-- %$* 13
his point was that you want to lock out the poor. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 210
that's what he said. %$* 13
and i said, is that true? %$* 13
well, again, it depends what you mean. %$* 213
in other words, if you're talking about preventing tens of millions of people coming here and driving down wages, yeah, that's certainly true. %$* 213
i'm trying to prevent that. %$* 213
even though they are living in total misery back home, and they would be earning five to 10 times as much as they came here. %$* 210
it's perfectly true. %$* 213
if you allow an unlimited number of foreign workers to come to the united states and take a job under any circumstances, those foreign workers would benefit. %$* 213
they would end up being much more prosperous than they are right now. %$* 213
but ordinary americans would be hurt at the same time by a comparable amount. %$* 213
all right. %$* 13
stop there. %$* 13
bryan, is that true? %$* 13
no, it is not. %$* 210
so if you want to get an idea-- %$* 210
well, no. %$* 13
i mean, it sounds extremely plausible. %$* 13
well-- %$* 210
so since we're in new york, let's talk about one of the greatest open borders experiments in history, puerto rico. %$* 210
puerto rico started out as a third world country. %$* 210
when the united states beat spain. %$* 210
there was open borders. %$* 210
what has happened? %$* 210
well, first of all, about half of puerto rico left over the course of a hundred years. %$* 210
secondly, puerto rico is now one of the richest countries in the world. %$* 210
what happened? %$* 210
people in puerto rico, who otherwise would have been stuck in a third world country, not able to use their skills, many of them left and found that there was a better place for them to work. %$* 210
and those remaining found that their wages were higher. %$* 210
a lot of what happened was that puerto ricans went home and turned a third world country into a first world country. %$* 210
there's no reason that america cannot do for the world what it did for puerto rico. %$* 210
the whole world? %$* 213
one difference-- %$* 213
for the world. %$* 210
one difference is-- %$* 213
really? %$* 13
one difference is that puerto rico-- %$* 213
give me-- %$* 210
give me a century, and i will give you prosperity over the surface of the earth. %$* 210
you got it. %$* 13
we will-- %$* 13
we will meet you here-- %$* 13
let's go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
right there in the center, sir, and if you can raise-- %$* 13
stand up when the mike comes from your left-hand side and tell us your name. %$* 13
thank you, this is terrific. %$* 18
my name is gerry ohrstrom , and my question is for the panelists opposing the resolution. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
unz, you asserted that opening labor markets would not only be devastating to local labor but to the general economy itself. %$* 18
and yet economists often advise us that economies are not so much about producers and workers but about consumers. %$* 18
and to the extent that foreign workers are hired at all, it's because it's deemed that they will produce goods and services with higher quality at cheaper prices than the local market that they-- %$* 18
the local labor market that they outcompete, which, in turn, is wonderful for the economy. %$* 18
could you address that, please, and could the other panelists respond? %$* 18
well, it's certainly true. %$* 213
ron unz. %$* 13
the economy would grow, but the benefits-- %$* 213
the growth would be captured by the factors of production that are not based on labor. %$* 213
it would be captured by capital. %$* 213
in other words, it's the sort of thing where if you suddenly have a vast increase in america's population, population of workers, the economy will obviously be larger. %$* 213
in other words, there'll be more goods, more services, more people buying things; and it's also true that those 10s of millions or even maybe 100s of millions of foreign workers would be much wealthier in the united states than they were back home in china or india or africa or wherever they were before. %$* 213
but ordinary americans, the existing-- %$* 213
the current americans would be dramatically hurt by it. %$* 213
they would be much poorer. %$* 213
so what it really comes down to is whether it's important to safeguard the prosperity of ordinary americans even at the expense of decreasing the impoverishment of tens or hundreds of millions of people from overseas. %$* 213
i mean, again, the numbers involved would be gigantic. %$* 213
if we had a policy right now that anybody could take a job anywhere, i think we'd be talking about 10, 20, 30 million people coming to the united states in the first few years of something like that. %$* 213
again, people right now are earning a dollar an hour, 50 cents an hour, 10 cents an hour, and if suddenly they could earn $7 an hour in the united states, it would seem awfully good to them. %$* 213
bryan caplan. %$* 13
the people who employ them would drive down the wages, and ordinary workers would be tremendously damaged by it. %$* 213
bryan caplan, i think he just described your fantasy, come true. %$* 13
yes. %$* 210
so the problem is that ron keeps talking about labor like there's only one kind of labor. %$* 210
so everyone in america is identical to everyone else on earth, so you could be replaced in whatever job you're doing by anyone on earth, but that, of course, is not true. %$* 210
there are many different kinds of labor. %$* 210
rich countries send out much more skilled workers. %$* 210
so you should expect that skilled workers would be among the beneficiaries of the increase in the supply of lower skilled workers. %$* 210
now, does this mean that every american will gain? %$* 210
that is much less clear. %$* 210
that's where i said if it's only a minority of americans who are losing, then it is very feasible to say, "we will charge you an admission fee or a surtax and give you some compensation." but what ron is talking about is keeping out almost everyone on earth and losing all these benefits that we could otherwise have and, of course, trapping most of the world in poverty for no reason. %$* 210
you know, and, ron, i want to bring back to you something that bryan said in his opening statement that we haven't got to, which he talked about the renewal of the society and the economy by virtue of having fresh blood, immigrant blood, both the energy and the creativity and the innovation that can come from that. %$* 13
and you haven't addressed that as a value that they place very highly-- %$* 13
both of your opponents do very highly. %$* 13
i think there's certainly a lot of truth to that. %$* 213
and in other words, over history america has benefitted tremendously from, you know, its large scale immigration, and i think probably the immigration we've had over the last 20 or 30 years has been very beneficial in many ways also. %$* 213
but the numbers really are awfully large right now. %$* 213
america right now has one of the most rapidly growing populations anywhere in the first world, much more rapidly growing than most other countries. %$* 213
in fact, for example, that sometimes is distorted. %$* 213
when the new york times or other people talk about america's growth in gdp and compare it to growth rates in europe or other countries, they're not talking about per capita gdp, they're talking about total gdp.right now america's population is growing at twice the rate of china's. %$* 213
so for example when you look at the growth of america's gdp, if it's 2 percent but if the population is growing by 1 percent, the per capita income growth is only 1 percent. %$* 213
the problem is ordinary americans care about per capita income, not the total gdp of the country. %$* 213
and even if the wealth of america increased by a lot, if we brought in 30 or 40 or 50 million foreign workers, but if the per capita income of ordinary americans dropped dramatically, that would be disaster. %$* 213
if you basically triple this population of a country, but everybody in the country becomes half as wealthy as they were before, the gdp is much larger, but it is a disaster for ordinary americans. %$* 213
but that's not what we're talking about. %$* 211
vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
you keep going to this doomsday scenario where we'll have the mexican hordes coming in here. %$* 211
that's not what we're talking about. %$* 211
let's go to another question. %$* 13
right over there, ma'am. %$* 13
there's a mic coming down the aisle. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you can tell us your name and-- %$* 13
my name is bret popper and i'm just curious-- %$* 19
we've been focusing on foreign workers coming to america. %$* 19
and i'm curious-- %$* 19
should americans be able to take jobs anywhere in the world? %$* 19
why not? %$* 210
yes. %$* 211
that's a great idea. %$* 211
that's the same question that bryan would ask. %$* 211
seeing if we're going to now tell the other-- %$* 211
economies of other counties will rise. %$* 211
things will get better in the rest of the world. %$* 211
there may well be a day when mexico has a stronger economy than the united states. %$* 211
now, imagine flipping it on its head, saying americans can't take a job in mexico because they happen to be north, west, or south. %$* 211
that's the same type of thinking we're doing right now. %$* 211
other than trying to uplift anyone and make the world a more equal-- %$* 211
more fair place where everyone is well off, we're talking about restricting ourselves. %$* 211
we're talking about closing our borders. %$* 211
god knows, we'll have a thousand billion people coming to america and taking our jobs away, decimating our salary, that's not how it's ever been. %$* 211
that's not how it will ever be. %$* 211
and if you create a third world country next door to us, if we keep having these restrictive policies, we'll create problems for ourselves. %$* 211
the solution is to uplift mexico and to have the same initiative as the u.s. and canada, where we don't worry about people going across borders. %$* 211
kathleen, do you want to take the question-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 212
about americans-- %$* 13
of course. %$* 212
traveling or do you want to respond to where vivek got to? %$* 13
well, i think they're related. %$* 212
okay. %$* 13
i-- %$* 212
because i do think that the ability to travel for a job is something that is and needs to be a matter of public policy, you know? %$* 212
there needs to be a better consensus on that within countries. %$* 212
and i think that a polity, self-constituted under a sovereign people, have the right to decide what kind of relationship they want to have with other countries. %$* 212
and i would, indeed-- %$* 212
i wish that we knew how to uplift mexico. %$* 212
i wish that we knew how to eliminate corruption and-- %$* 212
they're doing it on their own, thank you. %$* 211
gang warfare-- %$* 212
mexico doesn't need american handouts. %$* 211
and-- %$* 212
mexico is rising %$* 211
i'm not talking about handouts. %$* 212
well, let's talk about haiti. %$* 212
right. %$* 13
much better example. %$* 212
i wish we knew how to do that. %$* 212
i wish we had the will and the willingness-- %$* 212
to spend in haiti. %$* 212
that would solve all the problems. %$* 212
i couldn't agree with you more. %$* 212
if we knew how and had the will and the resources to level the playing field worldwide, we wouldn't be having this debate, because there wouldn't be a problem. %$* 212
there is-- %$* 210
compare it to another-- %$* 13
an easy solution to nation poverty, and that is, let haitians in, right now. %$* 210
if you can stand up, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i'm jibran sheik i have a question towards the people arguing for the motion. %$* 18
dr. %$* 18
caplan mentioned a moral imperative. %$* 18
and in this country, we can't provide health care for our citizens as it currently stands. %$* 18
education is terribly flawed. %$* 18
we have-- %$* 18
if we were to allow millions and even billions of people, theoretically, to come over here, wouldn't we have a moral obligation, then, to provide them if they were injured here, for example, or if their kids needed education? %$* 18
and if we're not able to address that for our own citizens, how would we be expected to do that for other people? %$* 18
wouldn't it be a little bit morally egregious to-- %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
bryan caplan. %$* 13
it's a very strong question. %$* 210
so i ask you imagine going to haiti and saying, "look, we know that you would love to come here and get a job. %$* 210
we know that there's plenty of people who want to employ you, but unfortunately, if you came, we would feel obliged to give you some other free stuff. %$* 210
and we don't want to give you any free stuff, so you have to stay in haiti earning $1 a day.” that is the kind of humanitarianism that america has right now. %$* 210
i think that is a very poor kind of humanitarianism. %$* 210
the haitians would much prefer someone who would say, "i would-- %$* 210
i'm willing to let you come in and get a job. %$* 210
i'm not going to give you free stuff, but i'm not going to keep you away, because i don't want to look at poverty.” and that is really what our current system does. %$* 210
it creates an enormous amount of poverty and then it keeps it away from us so we don't have to look at it. %$* 210
open borders is an incredible solution to poverty, but it is true. %$* 210
you have to look at poor people, if they were to come in. %$* 210
that is the price we pay for actually gravely producing the problem. %$* 210
kathleen newland, i think that question also went to some of what you said in your opening statement. %$* 13
would you like to take that? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 212
well, i think that-- %$* 212
again, you know, i don't think we want to live in a country where poverty is tolerated. %$* 212
and i don't think we-- %$* 212
and in order not to have poverty in our midst, i think we have to have a framework whereby the immigrants that we do admit-- %$* 212
and we admit a lot, and i'm glad of it. %$* 212
and i would like to see us admit more. %$* 212
but i don't think that we can create the kind of framework for a good society, for the kind of society we want to live in. %$* 212
our immigration policy is only as good as our integration policy. %$* 212
and our integration policy for immigrants that makes them part of our society on equal terms is not something we can do for the whole world. %$* 212
and kathleen-- %$* 210
bryan caplan. %$* 13
so, kathleen, you seem like a very nice person. %$* 210
you've been to calcutta. %$* 210
i am. %$* 212
you know how horrible things there are. %$* 210
i find it very strange to say that it's so important that we not have to look at you, that we're going to keep you living here in horrible poverty because you might come to america and earn minimum wage. %$* 210
it seems crazy to me. %$* 210
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing out this motion: let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and tonight's debate is also being broadcast right now worldwide on our website, iq2us.org and on fora.tv. %$* 13
and i want to tell you that if you're watching the live stream right now, we'd love to hear from you too. %$* 13
if you send us your questions on twitter or facebook, we're watching. %$* 13
and if you have a good question with a hash tag ‘jobs debate,’ that'll get our attention. %$* 13
and if it's a good question, we'd love to bring it here to the lectern and to our debaters. %$* 13
let's go back to some questions. %$* 13
sir, yep. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
dan kim. %$* 18
i am addressing the motion for why should we replace the immigration system and the system for selecting foreign people from coming here and taking jobs and replace it with a radical-- %$* 18
let anyone take a job in the united states? %$* 18
the current system, albeit, it has certain flaws, it is not-- %$* 18
we're not isolationists. %$* 18
we already have a system that selects people to come into our united states and work in-- %$* 18
as mr. %$* 18
wadhwa said, there is already renaissance of innovative technology throughout the world that is going on. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
actually, you put your question first, and then you did your argument afterwards. %$* 13
if you had stopped at the question, it was bingo. %$* 13
it was just perfect. %$* 13
but it's a good question. %$* 13
let's go to this side. %$* 13
thank you for that question. %$* 13
you know, the u.s.system is broken. %$* 211
maybe it worked a long time ago. %$* 211
there was a time when there was no such thing as visas. %$* 211
there were no passports. %$* 211
you could easily come to the united states. %$* 211
and that's when the u.s.developed into the powerhouse that it is. %$* 211
most recently, there has been lots of problems with the number of visas, all these restrictions. %$* 211
we now have a reverse brain drain going on. %$* 211
we have skilled talent leaving the country because we won't give them enough visas. %$* 211
we have this protectionist sentiment. %$* 211
now we have a clogged congress which can't even keep the government open, let alone do rational immigration reform. %$* 211
because why? %$* 211
because you have a small segment of american society which believes that if we open the doors, billions will come in. %$* 211
they'll take our jobs away, and this country will go to the dogs. %$* 211
i mean, this is the problem we have right now. %$* 211
so your answer to his question, when he said we actually have a functioning system, not perfect, but-- %$* 13
system is not functioning. %$* 211
sets priorities. %$* 13
it's broken right now. %$* 211
okay. %$* 13
you do not agree with %$* 13
right now, as of the last two or three years, it's broken. %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
let me take the same question, if you want to respond, ron unz. %$* 13
and if you don't, i can move on to another question. %$* 13
i-- %$* 212
can i just-- %$* 212
kathleen, newland, go ahead, sure. %$* 13
say one thing about that. %$* 212
i think the u.s.system leaves a lot to be desired. %$* 212
i think it does need fixing. %$* 212
but i don't see why we should replace it with a system that's completely employer driven. %$* 212
and that is it, you know, let anyone take a job anywhere means- it means that employers set the terms of-- %$* 212
what are the implications of that? %$* 13
immigration. %$* 212
when you say that the-- %$* 13
essentially you're saying the flow of labor would be completely under the influence of employers. %$* 13
what are the implications of that? %$* 13
well, currently, in the united states, our immigration system is overwhelmingly driven by family reunification. %$* 212
and that means that 70 percent of the people who get a green card, about 10 percent of them are refugees, about 14 percent are selected by employers. %$* 212
14 percent, that's all we have now. %$* 212
and yet we still get the best and the brightest, a larger proportion of the best and the brightest than any other country. %$* 212
now, we may not get them all. %$* 212
we may not get as many as we need. %$* 212
we may not get as many as we could, but we get a lot. %$* 212
they're going back now. %$* 211
we're now in reverse. %$* 211
well, we're not in reverse. %$* 212
and employers are not evil. %$* 211
employers are-- %$* 211
as long as you have regulations and have minimum levels, employers are not going to bring in people from abroad when they can hire equally competent better people here. %$* 211
they don't want the cultural problems. %$* 211
they don't want to have the costs involved with it. %$* 211
they don't have to-- %$* 211
want to have to pay for the health insurance when they don't have to. %$* 211
they will do what's right for them. %$* 211
and there's nothing wrong with letting employers select the people they want to hire. %$* 211
i just want to get back to kathleen. %$* 13
you started answering my question, and maybe that is the answer. %$* 13
but the implications of-- %$* 13
what i think you-- %$* 13
what i thought i heard you saying is you're concerned about throwing out a system that essentially is under the control of a political process, giving it-- %$* 13
giving the control of the flow of labor to-- %$* 13
that's what i'm saying. %$* 212
employers. %$* 13
and i just want to get a clearer picture of what that means and why you are, i guess, frightened by it or-- %$* 13
because it's not the job of employers to pursue the public good. %$* 212
it's the job of the employers to pursue the good of their companies. %$* 212
that's as it should be. %$* 212
that is part of what accounts for the dynamism of our economy. %$* 212
but they don't have a responsibility for the integration of immigration. %$* 212
they don't have a responsibility for the families of immigrants. %$* 212
they don't-- %$* 212
and when you bring people in through a family channel-- %$* 212
and i think we probably overdo it on that. %$* 212
but when you bring them in, you have an integration machine that gets going there. %$* 212
people are coming into a community. %$* 212
they're coming into a family. %$* 212
they're coming into a social system. %$* 212
okay. %$* 13
i see with clarity what you're saying. %$* 13
i've been an employer who has hired foreign workers. %$* 211
i hired lots of people from the uk in the '90s from britain. %$* 211
and i took responsibility for making sure that their families came here and making sure they had health coverage. %$* 211
you're unusual. %$* 212
making sure that they integrated, there weren't cultural issues. %$* 211
but that's what employers do. %$* 211
the employers aren't evil. %$* 211
they're not going to bring in slave labor just to cut some costs. %$* 211
they're going to do what makes sense for them and for their companies, where integration has to happen. %$* 211
i suggest you go to the central valley in california, not just silicon valley. %$* 212
we're talking about the rest of america. %$* 211
you know, we keep coming back to farmworkers. %$* 211
let's not just say because of some abuse in some segments of america we shut off-- %$* 211
we close the doors, and we start-- %$* 211
no, i'm not suggesting that. %$* 212
are going to come in and take farm jobs away. %$* 211
if we have minimum wages, if we have regulations, if we now require them to have-- %$* 211
provide health insurance, these things will not happen. %$* 211
hi. %$* 13
my name is victoria, and i have a question for-- %$* 19
i think your mic's not turned on. %$* 13
can we just double-check? %$* 13
hello. %$* 19
there it is. %$* 13
you said that one of your main concerns is looking at the poor and acknowledging the poor and being right-- %$* 19
who are you addressing, which-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 19
team of the side for. %$* 19
the side arguing for the motion. %$* 13
yeah, sorry. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
but it seems like there is a blind spot for the poverty that exists here now. %$* 19
so i'm wondering how the poverty population here would be uplifted by your plan. %$* 19
and also-- %$* 19
wait, wait. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
i need a little more clarity on what you mean. %$* 13
and i want to make sure it relates to our motion. %$* 13
well, because part of the-- %$* 19
part of the proposal-- %$* 19
part of the reason for letting people in is altruism, because it's wrong not to. %$* 19
it's wrong to say to a poor person, “hey, you know what? %$* 19
we know your poor, and your conditions suck, but we just don't want you in because we don't feel like it.” %$* 19
well, there goes the npr broadcast. %$* 13
so i'm wondering, what about the blind spot for the people who-- %$* 19
the americans, the poverty here? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to respectfully pass on the question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
then, but i have a second part. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
but i need you to get to it. %$* 13
if it-- %$* 19
if it uplifts the country, if it level-- %$* 19
if it’s a leveler for other countries, what about the brain drain, what about the-- %$* 19
the effect on the other countries? %$* 13
yeah, with all of those talented people leaving, how does that uplift their economy? %$* 19
fair question. %$* 13
let's take that to bryan caplan. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
sure. %$* 210
so first thing when you think about brain drain is, when people complain about it, they really are asking us to do to the people in the third world what the soviet union did to its own citizens. %$* 210
it's a scary thought. %$* 210
however, you could say, well, it was very good for the soviet union to keep their smart people in. %$* 210
at least they didn't get to run away. %$* 210
but i would say, you know, more important-- %$* 210
the more fundamental plight is that the-- %$* 210
letting smart people go to other countries actually creates benefits for not only themselves, not only the world economy, but for people back home. %$* 210
so kathleen mentioned remittances. %$* 210
and if you just want to get an idea about how it works, take a look at puerto rico; started out as a third world country. %$* 210
wait. %$* 13
you've done puerto rico. %$* 13
again, i just-- %$* 13
just for the use of time. %$* 13
i just want to give ron unz a chance to respond to the brain drain question. %$* 13
well, i mean, that's certainly true. %$* 213
in other words, if we're talking about the brain drain, we're talking about relatively small numbers of highly educated, highly talented people. %$* 213
and that's very different than allowing anybody to take a job anywhere, where the numbers implied are from a population based on the billions rather than in the hundreds of thousands or maybe in the millions. %$* 213
now, you know, again, there are a lot of pluses and minusess with immigration flows in the united states. %$* 213
i think on balance it's been positive for the united states, but at reasonable levels. %$* 213
hundreds of thousands a year, sometimes getting up to a million a year, that's very different than the proposition, which is talking about unlimited numbers, which i think would be disastrous-- %$* 213
do employers making job offers and then-- %$* 211
and people taking jobs. %$* 211
that's what we're talking about. %$* 211
we're not saying-- %$* 211
well, that's part of the argument, but the motion doesn't say, "let anyone take a job anywhere subject to employers minimum wage." but-- %$* 13
no, but-- %$* 13
come here-- %$* 211
yes. %$* 13
and then look for a job, i mean-- %$* 211
yeah, but-- %$* 13
we're not talking about removing all barriers. %$* 211
we're talking about if you have a job offer, if you find a skilled worker somewhere, you can hire them. %$* 211
you need a mike, come through here. %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 19
hi, my name is tatiana, and i'm an immigrant. %$* 19
i was born in soviet union. %$* 19
now it's moldova, the poorest country on the continent i think in europe. %$* 19
glad to have you. %$* 13
so-- %$* 19
so-- %$* 19
two things i wanted to mention, so, number one-- %$* 19
i need you to ask a question and one-- %$* 13
exactly. %$* 19
just one question, okay? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
pick the best one. %$* 13
only one question. %$* 19
go for it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
so 10 years ago, i-- %$* 19
my salary was $30 a month. %$* 19
five years ago i moved to america. %$* 19
if it took me only five years to get here and get a job and be successful, i think anybody can do it, so i don't think that the laws here limit people. %$* 19
people that are really motivated, that are driven to want to do things, they will. %$* 19
i need a question from you. %$* 13
so my question is-- %$* 19
about the european union. %$* 19
so my question is about european union, there are countries in european union that people that are part of european union have no rights to work in, for example-- %$* 19
i mean they need a work permit-- %$* 19
switzerland is one of them-- %$* 19
it's not a member of the european union. %$* 212
so my question to you would be if we would take european union as an example, i don't think that it economically they have done a really good job, so i wouldn't go by their example at all, and there are austria, germany, and-- %$* 19
wait a minute. %$* 13
i have to stop you-- %$* 13
because you've been talking for two minutes, and i truly need a question. %$* 13
okay, my question is-- %$* 19
if you can do it. %$* 13
i'm a little nervous-- %$* 19
so my question is if european union-- %$* 19
i mean if we are go by european union platform, where would we go? %$* 19
because i don't think they have been a good example-- %$* 19
so, can i rephrase your question this way, that-- %$* 13
"is the european union a good model for something that can work this way? %$* 13
" that would be it? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 19
okay, let's take that to this side. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
you know, i've been doing this a long time. %$* 13
i know how to compress. %$* 13
there's no shame in struggling through a question. %$* 13
i've done a lot of it a lot of times. %$* 13
i just get to edit it out of this broadcast, so-- %$* 13
i'm so glad to have a question from moldova. %$* 212
i've been working there a lot in the last year. %$* 212
i've been there four times so i want to talk to you afterwards. %$* 212
kathleen newland. %$* 13
the-- %$* 212
it's really the other way around. %$* 212
the united states was a model for the european union, and in a sort of fundamental sense of trying to reach the economies of scale, the continental economies of scale, that the european union-- %$* 212
that the united states had by virtue of being one country, so the european union has gradually eliminated first, you know, its tariff barriers, and tried to integrate into its coal and steel industries at the very beginning. %$* 212
and finally this is the last step to integrate its labor markets. %$* 212
so i think they are still struggling. %$* 212
there have been a lot of strains particularly with the broadening to-- %$* 212
at-- %$* 212
with the more shallow preparation efforts for new entrants like croatia and romania and bulgaria compared to italy, france, and-- %$* 212
italy and greece and spain. %$* 212

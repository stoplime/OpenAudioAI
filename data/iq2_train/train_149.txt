you'd like to start all over. %$* 13
and if you did, would you write in whether it's an amendment or in the body of the constitution-- %$* 13
would you write in a basic right to self-defense? %$* 13
i would certainly consider it. %$* 432
it makes a lot of sense. %$* 432
but quite obviously, as i suggested in my opening remarks, it's a very, very capacious right. %$* 432
does it extend to martha stewart, a convicted felon? %$* 432
and to me, it seems the answer should be yes. %$* 432
if martha stewart had knocked over a bank with a gun, i'm not sure that i would say she preserves her constitutional right to self-defense. %$* 432
what about non-u.s. nationals who live in the united states? %$* 432
you know, do they not bleed? %$* 432
do they not have lives that are threatened? %$* 432
and then what about illegal aliens? %$* 432
the fifth circuit, as i'm sure eugene and david both know, split 2-1 on whether or not a federal law that prohibits illegal aliens from possessing guns is constitutional. %$* 432
their argument was that the point of the original second amendment-- %$* 432
and i think they're correct. %$* 432
i didn't do adequate justice to bob rosenkranz's initial introduction-- %$* 432
i think the historical origins of the second amendment really do have to do with citizen militias and organizing to overthrow corrupt governments. %$* 432
and the argument was that an illegal alien isn't part of the american community politically, which is certainly true. %$* 432
that doesn't mean that an illegal alien has no right to self-defense. %$* 432
the right of the people to bear-- %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
arms throughout american history has had a self-defense component as well. %$* 434
we see that in the pennsylvania constitution of 1776, which talked about the right of the people to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves in the states later on was more clearly even changed to each citizen defense of himself-- %$* 434
but that wasn't put in the u.s.constitution. %$* 432
they knew about that and they didn't put it in. %$* 432
but they talked about the right of the people to keep and bear arms. %$* 434
what you're suggesting is that the second amendment-- %$* 434
you're suggesting the second amendment is obsolete in part because it used-- %$* 434
the framers used the term keep and bear arms there in a way that's different from the way that it was being commonly used in the coordinate state constitutions of the time. %$* 434
i think you're creating obsolescence of your own making. %$* 434
you're interpreting it in a strange way as saying well, it wasn't intended to deal with the self-defense, and now you're saying it's obsolete. %$* 434
well, i'm saying it was intended throughout to deal with self-defense. %$* 434
it was also aimed at a means of deterring government tyranny, but the interest of self-defense has been always around, and if you look at court decisions of the early 1800s, all the time-- %$* 434
eugene, let's let alan alan dershowitz. %$* 13
focusing on the wrong words. %$* 305
i'm not denying that the right to bear arms might have some current relevance as part of a right of self-defense. %$* 305
what i am arguing is that prelude to the operative words of the amendment clearly have become obsolete, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security. %$* 305
now, the answer that david gives is you want the deacons of justice to be able to come and have an armed conflict with the ku klux klan. %$* 305
now i was in the south during the civil rights movement. %$* 305
the last thing martin luther king wanted was to arm the people and the civil rights workers. %$* 305
he wanted to confront violence with peace, and a well-regulated militia would've included the ku klux klan. %$* 305
they were the citizens. %$* 305
they were the ones who were worried about the government taking away their civil right to have a segregated community. %$* 305
and the answer that my opponents give is if the ku klux klan is armed, then we ought to arm civil rights workers, and let's have a war. %$* 305
i think martin luther king gets the better of that argument. %$* 305
i mean, alan, david kopel. %$* 13
i don’t hear them saying that or even coming close to implying that. %$* 13
even though it's a great-- %$* 13
that was a great moment. %$* 13
but i want the point is-- %$* 13
david kopel. %$* 13
those who want-- %$* 433
the majorities that want to oppress minorities like the ku klux klan with local police connivance, they're always going to have arms and i applaud your presence in the south. %$* 433
you perhaps might not have been on the summer march from mississippi to memphis led by dr. %$* 433
king where the deacons for defense were there and, in fact, were providing personal security for dr. %$* 433
king himself. %$* 433
all right. %$* 13
i want to move on-- %$* 13
and how did that end up for dr. %$* 305
king? %$* 305
huh? %$* 433
how did that end up for dr. %$* 305
king? %$* 305
not very well. %$* 305
i want to move on to the-- %$* 13
the availability of a gun. %$* 433
i want to move on to another-- %$* 13
i don't understand what you're saying. %$* 434
the assassins are going to have the guns. %$* 434
the question is whether people ought to be able to have guns to defend themselves. %$* 434
the assassins have an easier time getting the guns when they're easily available in society. %$* 305
how do you propose making it hard for an assassin in a country-- %$* 434
how do you propose making it hard for a political assassin who is willing to throw away the rest of his life essentially for his act, making it hard for him to get a gun in a country where there are 300 million guns. %$* 434
that's the point. %$* 305
that there are 300 million guns. %$* 305
i want to live in a country where there are not 300 million guns. %$* 305
all right. %$* 13
i want to stop this for a moment. %$* 13
i want to stop this. %$* 13
we are starting to turn into a gun control debate here, which is not precisely what we're doing. %$* 13
what we're trying to focus on is the function of this power being enshrined in the constitution or not, and i want to return to that by going to something that sandy levinson said where you basically were telling the other side that they don't really need to have this right enshrined in the constitution and protected, because the political process as it is is already tilting, i think was the word you used, towards increasing gun rights. %$* 13
and i want you to take 30 seconds to push that point and then i'd like to hear the response from your opponents, because i think that they said the opposite. %$* 13
okay. %$* 432
ninety percent of the american public, rightly or wrongly, but 90 percent of the american public thought that the senate should at least take a vote on enhancing background checks. %$* 432
it never got to the floor of the senate. %$* 432
last night i think the nra invited people before the debate to chime in with their views, and i was told before we came out that the current vote is something like 43,000 against the motion and-- %$* 432
you mean on the intelligence squared website? %$* 13
yes. %$* 432
yes, we were-- %$* 13
we experienced a blizzard of votes. %$* 13
right. %$* 432
and-- %$* 432
and it's 90-- %$* 13
it's 46,000 against the motion and 700 for the motion. %$* 13
the strongest argument for substantive constitutional rights is when you believe that a vulnerable minority is likely to be victimized by what americans learned to call "the tyranny of the majority." whatever your views are on gun control, at least right now-- %$* 432
and throughout most of american history-- %$* 432
it is so wildly unlikely that the-- %$* 432
however many people own the 300 million guns-- %$* 432
because most people who own guns, i think, own multiple guns-- %$* 432
that they are comparable to jehovah’s witnesses, say, or some other vulnerable minority that they need the special concern of judges, basically, to make up public policy for the entire country. %$* 432
okay. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
so-- %$* 433
well, actually-- %$* 13
did-- %$* 13
i'd like to hear david-- %$* 13
from david on that-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 433
because you raised this point, that in fact, the constitutional amendment was required as a bulwark against the political process. %$* 13
and your opponent is saying that the winds are blowing so heavily in your-- %$* 13
in your direction, that that's not necessary. %$* 13
constitutional rights are not only for persecuted minorities. %$* 433
i don't think abc, cbs, the new york times, and the new york daily news are comparable to jehovah's witnesses either. %$* 433
and it's very important that there be a strong first amendment to protect them. %$* 433
and in nebraska, where the right to arms is culturally strong, the second amendment is still necessary for exactly one of the issues you raised-- %$* 433
the right of legal permanent resident aliens to obtain concealed carry permits to carry handguns for lawful protection as law-abiding american citizens can do. %$* 433
and unfortunately, there are in this large and diverse country just about anything that you can say is nationally popular is going to be nationally unpopular with some local group of people who don't celebrate diversity and respect all rights. %$* 433
and in places like new york city and san francisco and chicago, with their irrationally extreme anti-gun administrations-- %$* 433
absolutely the second amendment-- %$* 433
okay. %$* 13
so, then what would-- %$* 13
look like without the second amendment? %$* 13
everything else being equal. %$* 13
i know it's awkward, but everything else being equal, if the protection weren't there, where would we be in terms of gun ownership in this country? %$* 13
people in washington dc would have no right to defend themselves in their home against a violent home intruder, for example. %$* 433
even if they voted that way-- %$* 305
this is interesting. %$* 305
what you're-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
in argument for diversity, that would deny the people of new york the right to show their diversity by saying, "we don't want to be like montana. %$* 305
we would much prefer to have fewer guns." that argument is rejected in the name of diversity? %$* 305
diversity is not suppressing someone else's rights. %$* 433
that's no part of diversity. %$* 433
diversity is respecting everyone's human rights fully. %$* 433
and respecting them from a point of view of the majority prevails when you have different views, and different cultures, and difference societies, and different attitudes, and different approaches. %$* 305
and if the people of new york city have a different view from your view, why should they not have the right to express that view and have it implemented? %$* 305
because-- %$* 433
isn't there a right to a gun-free society as well? %$* 305
why don't we have that right? %$* 305
is there a right to-- %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
is there a right to a blasphemy-free society? %$* 434
is there a right to a-- %$* 434
no, because blasphemy doesn't hurt anybody. %$* 305
so, but the whole point of individual rights are that they are trumps on majority rule. %$* 434
sandy levinson said, you need to have the right to blasphemy, otherwise the jehovah's witnesses would be prosecuted. %$* 305
the reason abc and nbc have the first amendment rights is we can't distinguish between them and the jehovah's witness handing out a leaflet. %$* 305
the basic right belongs to the jehovah's witness. %$* 305
the derivative right belongs to abc-- %$* 305
that's the only reason we have-- %$* 18
hold on. %$* 13
sandy levinson is much too polite for this debate, so i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm creating an opening for him and you're to step through, sandy. %$* 13
all right. %$* 432
i'm just a texan. %$* 432
i think we ought to be aware that there's something strange. %$* 432
again, what everyone's views are about gun rights in the united states-- %$* 432
there's something strange in referring to them as a human right, because-- %$* 432
and here's, i think, where alan's point comes home-- %$* 432
it really is quite remarkable that among the roughly 190 countries or so that are currently in the u.n., there are a grand total of four that recognize some kind of constitutionalized right to bear arms. %$* 432
and you discover that the mexican constitution allows reasonable regulation. %$* 432
so, it may be-- %$* 432
i mean, this is-- %$* 432
again, topic for a different sort of conversation-- %$* 432
it may be that there is something about american culture that recognizes that it is a right within the united states. %$* 432
it's part of american exceptionalism that guns are treated much more seriously than anywhere else in the world, but human rights arguments really do have a universalistic overtone. %$* 432
we talk about intervening in foreign countries because they don't recognize human rights. %$* 432
so does david suggest that we invade-- %$* 432
but aren't they saying-- %$* 13
one or another of the 108 countries-- %$* 432
just for clarity on what they said. %$* 13
they didn't say that guns are the basic right. %$* 13
they said self-defense is the basic right. %$* 13
but guns are necessary for self-defense. %$* 305
i think that's what david means. %$* 305
eugene volokh. %$* 13
i don't think american rights should be obsolete just because foreign countries don't agree with us on that. %$* 434
no. %$* 432
i'm talking about-- %$* 432
no. %$* 432
i'm not making that argument. %$* 432
i'm simply talking about nomenclature that it's one thing to say we in america are committed to certain rights, some of which look very, very odd to the rest of the world. %$* 432
we could talk about hate speech in this context, and you and i both agree that hate speech is protected by the 1st amendment. %$* 432
most countries around the world don't protect hate speech, and they're decent liberal countries who simply have a different understanding of what free speech means. %$* 432
all i'm saying is that an argument based on the particularities of american culture is very different from an argument based on human rights. %$* 432
all right. %$* 13
david kopel, would you like to respond to that? %$* 13
the united states is unique with its exclusionary rule against illegally seized evidence being used in court. %$* 433
we have much stronger rules against the establishment of religion than most other countries do, but i think the fact that many countries have gone away from what was traditionally their respect for much of their history of the right to arms and of the right of self-defense, does not denigrate that right from it existing at all as a human right. %$* 433
as the united states supreme court said, the right to assemble and the right to bear arms are both found wherever civilization-- %$* 433
which countries have moved away from the basic right of self-defense? %$* 305
oh, england. %$* 433
england? %$* 305
england. %$* 305
self-defense. %$* 305
you mean to have it enacted stand your ground laws? %$* 305
no. %$* 433
it means their guns laws are structured-- %$* 433
no, no, no. %$* 305
i'm talking about self-defense. %$* 305
great britain common law provides for a fundamental right of self-defense. %$* 305
i challenge you to name one country that has abolished the right of self-defense. %$* 305
england has gravely restricted it in practice. %$* 433
fortunately under intense popular pressure they had some reforms a couple of years ago, which restored some of it, but they have the principle of proportionality. %$* 433
of course they do. %$* 305
that makes sense. %$* 305
well, no. %$* 433
not as it works in england, because if you're a woman and a guy who weighs 200 pounds more than you is beating you to death with his hands and fists, under english law you can only-- %$* 433
could only fight back with your hands and fists. %$* 433
you couldn't shoot that person, because then you, the victim, woman, would be escalating. %$* 433
on the other hand, the nra proposes a law whereby if you're in your car and can go from zero to 60 in one second, somebody comes over to you with a knife and you have the option of running away, you have the right to stand your ground, pull out your oozie and kill him in cold blood. %$* 305
that's the nra's position on self-defense. %$* 305
there are absurd nra positions on self- defense. %$* 305
there are reasonable-- %$* 305
all right. %$* 13
again, we're not debating-- %$* 13
i prefer the english rule to the florida rule. %$* 305
the nra's stance on gun control tonight, but we are-- %$* 13
this point did come up in terms of the constitutional issue. %$* 13
your opponent-- %$* 13
speaking out to the side that's arguing that the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness, your opponent said well, you know, the constitution-- %$* 13
the amendment may be there, the right to bear arms may be enshrined in the law, but that doesn't mean that you can't limit gun control. %$* 13
that, in fact, the heller decision specified all sorts of situations, guns in the hands of mentally ill people, felons, et cetera, that as it is your hands aren't tied, in fact, to effect gun ownership laws in the united states, and i just want to have you respond to that and then hear what your opponent says in response. %$* 13
you know, i agree with that. %$* 432
sandy levinson. %$* 13
most americans, if you poll them, believe a) that there is some kind of fundamental individual right to own firearms, and b) that there ought to be reasonable regulation. %$* 432
so, the question is who ought to decide at the end of the day what counts as reasonable regulation? %$* 432
i believe precisely because there's so much difference-- %$* 432
good faith difference of opinion, that this is an america of the 21st century, a subject for legislative resolution. %$* 432
you won't like some of the particular solutions, but that's what federalism and political diversity is about. %$* 432
but none of us on this panel is arguing that the state can never ever limit guns, and at least as a political preference, neither alan nor i would support in the united states in the 21st century a proposal to ban any and all firearms, but we're talking about reasonable regulation and who ought to make reasonable regulation. %$* 432
but they're saying that the existing amendment does not-- %$* 13
is not an obstacle to reasonable regulation. %$* 13
well, but there's a tension here, because-- %$* 432
i mean, for the first 200 years of our history, the second amendment really played no role in american constitutional law, if you define that as judicial decisions, especially at the national level. %$* 432
it's only been in the last six, seven years that it's played any role. %$* 432
so, the debate, in part, as well, should the second amendment now really be invigorated so that five to four majorities of the supreme court will decide whether or not martha stewart should be able to have a gun for self-defense? %$* 432
and it appears, although justice scalia didn't offer even an iota of a reason-- %$* 432
that he said, "no, she doesn't get it." or do you want these-- %$* 432
let's say, hashed out? %$* 432
either the second amendment really has some genuine bite to it or it's an expressive aspect of the constitution-- %$* 432
all right. %$* 13
as it has-- %$* 432
as it was for roughly for the first 200 years of our history. %$* 432
i want to give eugene volokh a chance to respond. %$* 13
but after that, i'm going to come for questions for you in the audience. %$* 13
and the way that will work is just raise your hand. %$* 13
i'll call on you. %$* 13
well, a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
we will ask you to wait until the mic reaches you so that the radio broadcast folks and the folks listening on the live stream can hear you. %$* 13
i'll ask you to state your name and i'll ask you to ask a question that's focused on the topic tonight. %$* 13
eugene volokh. %$* 13
so let me answer sandy's point, and working, also, a point he made about the background checks failing in congress. %$* 434
my colleague, adam winkler at the ucla law school-- %$* 434
i don't think anybody would think as a hardcore nra-supporting, second amendment maximalist-- %$* 434
i think made a very good argument that the thing that probably most defeated background checks was the proposed ban on the so-called assault weapons, which are semi-automatic weapons that are really functionally not much different than other kinds of weapons. %$* 434
but they were singled out for specific prohibition. %$* 434
he said that poisoned the well, that after assuring people, "oh, we're not going to come to take your guns," people said, "whoa, they are coming to take our guns." and that caused people to dig on. %$* 434
you're talking about the functions of individual rights. %$* 434
one of the functions of individual rights is to provide enough of a detente in these kinds of social battles, especially culture war battles, that a side could say, "look, we're confident enough they're not coming to take our guns, that if what is on the table is a background check, it might pass just as it has passed in the past "-- %$* 434
in the early 90s. %$* 434
so, so, that's actually one advantage that the second amendment-- %$* 434
so securing an individual right. %$* 434
but more specifically, the call into question-- %$* 434
the quote is about the right to bear arms, specifically the right to bear arms being recognized as an individual right provides. %$* 434
if that were called into question, if that were repealed or people would say, "well, we would repeal it if it weren't for our better political sensibilities," that's the sort of thing that would poison the well further. %$* 434
so if you want to actually get a background check passed, you're much better off with a second amendment respected and firmly recognized as part our constitution, and then question and said to be something that's ripe for repeal. %$* 434
let's go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
and right there on the end. %$* 13
oh, let me just say one thing, because i need to do this for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
and i appreciate you waiting a second. %$* 13
tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org and on fora.tv. %$* 13
and if you're actually watching the live stream, we want to hear from you, too, during this part of the debate. %$* 13
you can send us questions on twitter or facebook with the hashtag #gunsdebate, so we won't miss it. %$* 13
and be sure to include your city, state, and your first name, at least. %$* 13
and i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters-- %$* 13
two teams of two-- %$* 13
debating this motion: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
we're going to audience questions. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
this question is for those arguing against the motion. %$* 19
when you talked about self-defense being a great spectrum from against personal security and also against the tyranny of the government, and also talking about how the second amendment, in some circumstances, is anachronistic, can you let me know what it looks like today, in the 21st century, for someone to defend themselves with arms against the tyranny of the government? %$* 19
david kopel. %$* 13
well, to start with, it's normal defensive uses when you happen to be in a neighborhood that is politically powerless. %$* 433
in chicago, like a lot of places, there are some neighborhoods that have a very strong police presence and a strong deterrent effect, and there are other neighborhoods that, for whatever reasons, get essentially very little protection. %$* 433
and when the government steps aside so that the rapists and thugs can do to you as they will, that is a form of at least of misgovernment, so people being able to protect themselves matters there. %$* 433
and you can look at the united states, fortunately, we don't need to protect ourselves against government in the sense that we were doing in 1776, but you can look around the world at the various tyrannies that exist and people sometimes using guns successfully protect themselves. %$* 433
now i would point out, every genocidal government of the last century has assiduously disarmed the intended victims of genocide beforehand, and you can say well, if you have handgun what good is that going to do you against a tank? %$* 433
well, they take the view, and they're the ones who are carrying out the genocide, they take the view that if there is any resistance, if even one of our-- %$* 433
out of 100 of our secret police were putting people on cattle cars gets shot, that could really mess up our genocide program. %$* 433
david, let me interrupt you a second, because i feel that you maybe slipped the question a little bit, not overly. %$* 13
no, no. %$* 13
i'm not saying that to be disrespectful, because the part of her question you answered, which was-- %$* 13
her question was related to where in the modern world in the united states would there be a militia resisting its government, and you described a situation in which the government was absent and so it fulfilled the function the government wasn't doing. %$* 13
but she asked a different question. %$* 13
is there a scenario you see in this country, i think, in this country where you would need to take up arms against that absent police force or any other force that represents the established government? %$* 13
not presently, but nobody in the united states in 1760 thought they'd have to be fighting the british 15 years later, and nobody-- %$* 433
no sane person in germany in 1930 thought that the country would fall-- %$* 433
would within 30 years fall into the hands of genocidal maniacs. %$* 433
well, how do you explain the fact that the highest ratio of opposition to free availability of guns are in the communities that have been subject to genocide? %$* 305
the jewish community, the african american community, and other communities that have been subject to genocide are the ones that are most opposed to vigilante people in america having guns. %$* 305
there must be-- %$* 305
either you're smarter than they are or they're self- interest is correct and you're wrong about genocide. %$* 305
you are stereotyping those people. %$* 433
there's far more diversity-- %$* 433
i'm counting them. %$* 305
there's-- %$* 18
i'm polling them. %$* 305
i'm saying majority wins. %$* 305
and if you look at the public opinion polls of the black community, they support gun ownership as a principle. %$* 433
they support the second amendment and they actually have a favorable view-- %$* 433
at much lower ratio than white anglo saxon protestants, right? %$* 305
blah, blah, blah. %$* 433
the point is-- %$* 433
now that's an intelligent response. %$* 305
so your point is blacks are pro nra, but they're not as pro nra as white people and therefore what? %$* 433
therefore it seems to me people know their own self-interests, and if you look at the ratio of people in various ethnic groups, i'm not stereotyping, as i say, i'm polling, you see that gun ownership favorability depends a great deal on cultural background, on background, historical background, and the very people that have been most subject to genocide are the very same people generally that seem to have a lower support for gun %$* 305
which has what to do with our motion? %$* 13
can i-- %$* 434
it has to do with his point about genocide. %$* 434
okay. %$* 13
what does your point have to do with our motion? %$* 13
can i offer a slightly different perspective? %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
i actually, and this is directly related to the motion. %$* 434
i’m not sure to what extent today private gun ownership in a country like america would be effective in stopping government tyranny. %$* 434
there are plausible arguments that by making tyranny more costly it may make it less likely even if ultimately they get super-tyrannical they could crush all opposition. %$* 434
plausible arguments to the contrary. %$* 434
but the question, recall, is whether the right to keep and bear arms has become obsolete. %$* 434
what i'm saying is, there used to be two main functions, one deterrence of government tyranny and one assurance of self- defense. %$* 434
it's possible that today the first function is not really achievable, but the second function is very much out there. %$* 434
i don't see the right as having become obsolete if one aspect of it, given changes in the structure of the military and the security apparatus and changes in modern weaponry, if that function is no longer usable, i'm not sure, but it may very well not be. %$* 434
all right. %$* 13
i want to bring up another question. %$* 13
very, very briefly, because i want to get in more questions. %$* 13
i think we're dancing around the fact that-- %$* 432
sandy levinson. %$* 13
there are at least thousands, and maybe even a couple of million americans who believe we do live in a tyranny, who are organized in militia movements. %$* 432
and all of the focus on self-defense and the idea that the second amendment-- %$* 432
the original second amendment is historically anachronistic, with regard to "oh, everybody believes the current united states is just wonderful," there are some people-- %$* 432
i don't agree with them, in terms of their own politics, but there are some people who don't think it's wonderful and who want to drill and know how to use arms against the possibility of engaging in armed revolt. %$* 432
now, do you support that as a protected second amendment right? %$* 432
that should be constitutional? %$* 432
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 13
eugene-- %$* 13
take-- %$* 13
that's an interesting question. %$* 434
15 seconds on this or-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 434
so-- %$* 434
and the %$* 13
right to drill? %$* 434
militias. %$* 432
i think probably would be-- %$* 434
i mean, if it initially-- %$* 434
if it's a conspiracy to actually engage in revolution? %$* 434
no. %$* 434
no. %$* 432
just to drill. %$* 432
yeah, why don't you stand up? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
probably. %$* 434
you're wearing a button. %$* 13
that makes me nervous. %$* 13
a mic will come down this side. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
and can you tell us your name, or at least your first name? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
hello. %$* 19
my name is lea. %$* 19
and i have a question for all of you, really, is why do you think the second amendment was intended to protect the rights of americans to rise up against a tyrannical government when article 1 in the constitution allows armed citizens in militias to suppress insurrections, not to cause them? %$* 19
the constitution defines treason as "levying war against the government" in article 3-- %$* 19
i'm going to stop you there, because you had a question mark after the-- %$* 13
i did. %$* 19
part. %$* 13
i did. %$* 19
you know, i think there's a deceptively easy answer-- %$* 432
sandy levinson. %$* 13
to your question. %$* 432
the 1787 constitution did not include the second amendment. %$* 432
the second amendment, as alan would emphasize, is part of the bill of rights that were added in 1791 at the behest of people who really were very suspicious of this new national government that was created by the constitution. %$* 432
and, you know, one could quote emerson or walt whitman, that the constitution contains contradictions. %$* 432
and you have put your finger on a very key contradiction-- %$* 432
do you disagree enough with that to want to argue with it-- %$* 13
david kopel? %$* 13
the supreme court justice story-- %$* 433
david kopel. %$* 13
would disagree that there was a contradiction there, as he explained in his treatises. %$* 433
that insurrection is an illegitimate, violent act-- %$* 433
violent action against the government. %$* 433
but if the second amendment militias, led by their state governments, were ever necessary to overthrow a tyranny, that would not be an insurrection-- %$* 433
like in the civil war. %$* 305
that would be-- %$* 433
like the civil war, right? %$* 305
the-- %$* 433
let me talk, please. %$* 433
that would be a restoration of constitutional order. %$* 433
that's what justice story's viewpoint is. %$* 433
it would be a dictatorship that was the insurrection, that was lawless, that was at war with the constitution. %$* 433
so was the civil war-- %$* 305
wait, alan, hang on-- %$* 13
a legitimate %$* 305
no, no. %$* 433
are you-- %$* 13
david, are you done? %$* 13
yes. %$* 433
okay. %$* 13
what-- %$* 13
alan. %$* 13
so, was the civil war legitimate or-- %$* 305
was it a legitimate insurrection or an illegal insurrection? %$* 305
i have an answer to that. %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
which civil war? %$* 434
do you mean the civil war against the federal government or the civil war that was fought between 1775 and 1781, in the u.s.? %$* 434
no. %$* 305
the one that we all refer to the "civil war." %$* 305
so, the answer is-- %$* 434
with a capital t, a capital c, and a capital w.a guy involving abraham lincoln. %$* 305
remember that one? %$* 305
so the answer-- %$* 434
was that a legitimate insurrection? %$* 305
that was lead by state militias. %$* 305
so the answer is-- %$* 434
someone help me out here with the question. %$* 13
that we think the revolutionary war was legitimate, partly because we were the ones on the winning side. %$* 434
but partly because we think it was a just insurrection; that we think the civil war is illegitimate because it was an unjust insurrection. %$* 434
but to return to your question, it's an excellent question. %$* 434
but if you'll look at the framing era documents and the post-framing documents-- %$* 434
and for that matter, the pre-framing documents, sir william blackstone's commentaries on the laws of england-- %$* 434
it was understood that while, obviously, every government must be able to suppress revolutions against it-- %$* 434
and it will, whether it's a tyrannical government or not-- %$* 434
one merit that was seen at the time-- %$* 434
again, i'm skeptical about it today-- %$* 434
but without question, historically seen at the time in an armed citizenry is it would preferably deter tyranny, and if necessary, overthrow it, recognizing that if it fails, that they'll be hung-- %$* 434
hanged for treason. %$* 434
that was understood. %$* 434
all right, sir. %$* 13
my name is john donahue. %$* 18
i thought i heard david kopel say that you were more likely to be shot as a burglar than to go to prison, which must be wildly off, because tens of thousands of burglars are in prison, and very few people are actually shot by homeowners. %$* 18
but my question goes to the question of an anachronism in light of the experience of other countries similar to the united states. %$* 18
so for example, australia, after experiencing-- %$* 18
sir, i just want to ask you to zoom in on your question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
so, to focus on australia, in 1996, they had experienced a horrific mass murder. %$* 18
and 12 days later, they decided to abolish all semi-automatic weapons and to abolish the right to use guns-- %$* 18
sir, i'm sorry. %$* 13
rules. %$* 13
i need you-- %$* 13
not too much premise and just get to the question, please. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
so the question is why, in light of the fact that their murder rate has dropped substantially since that time and is now about one-fourth or one-fifth the rate of the murder rate in the united states, do you parade these horribles as emanating from removing the second amendment if it seems as though the second amendment operates more in the way that alan dershowitz has suggested as an impediment to avoiding homicide? %$* 18
my concern with that question is i think that one of the debaters here said that there's always going to be evidence on both sides on the impact and that we would just get into descending studies. %$* 13
well, the question was asked-- %$* 434
and it would be a wash. %$* 18
well, no, because we have other things that we want to get onto. %$* 13
so, i would like to move on to them. %$* 13
well, i just want to say for the record i'm not sure of the factual assertions behind that question. %$* 434
exactly right and these guys will say it is and you'll have studies and nobody here has read them. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
you were with us before, weren't you? %$* 13
yes i was. %$* 18
how old were you last year? %$* 13
twelve. %$* 18
you were 12 last year? %$* 13
well, 13, i think. %$* 18
i don't remember exactly. %$* 18
you did a great question on our israel debate, and you're with collegiate school, right? %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
this whole row. %$* 13
welcome to our debate, guys. %$* 13
thanks for coming. %$* 13
so you have to be as good as you were last year when you were 12. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
so my question is for the people who are arguing against the motion. %$* 18
and my question is if-- %$* 18
i think-- %$* 18
something that i'm a little unsure of in your argument that i think is a bit of a contradiction. %$* 18
you've argued that you're not going to be able to successfully impede the right-- %$* 18
the ability of criminals to gain weapons. %$* 18
you used martin luther king at being politically assassinated as an example of that. %$* 18
yet, you also sort of stated that-- %$* 18
hey, just because you're 14 doesn't mean you can't zoom in on a question. %$* 13
so go for it. %$* 13
if-- %$* 18
let's see-- %$* 18
how will having political assassins not being able to access guns be related to people able to defend themselves against burglars in their home? %$* 18
if a burglar is able to get a gun, isn't that something a bit different than a political assassin who's willing to throw away their life? %$* 18
and so-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
this sort of self-defense situation. %$* 18
very quickly, david kopel. %$* 13
as your question recognizes, there's a wide variety of criminals with different intensities and motivation, and so a political assassin is sort of at the top of the scale in terms of long-term planning, and you can have other criminals who are much more casual. %$* 433
so, one of the anti-gun control arguments is what you're referring to-- %$* 433
the futility thesis. %$* 433
that nothing you do is ever going to stop criminals from having guns, and that is true for many criminals who are determined to get guns. %$* 433

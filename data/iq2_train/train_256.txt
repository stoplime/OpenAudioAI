sort of public spaces-- %$* 18
that's a really intriguing possibility of a public search facility or public search engine or some sort of non-corporate entity that would help us guide us in certain issues, right? %$* 603
that's a nice idea, and i think it's worth pursuing and experimenting. %$* 603
i'm not willing to predict the results. %$* 603
i think the important thing is that we try everything. %$* 603
the important thing is that we let a few things fail, and we try to learn from our mistakes. %$* 603
but we do so openly. %$* 603
we do so deliberately. %$* 603
and we don't sign away so many important things to a black box. %$* 603
jacob weisberg, your point. %$* 13
i was going to say that the google skeptics-- %$* 126
have you tried bing? %$* 126
there are alternative search engines. %$* 126
but i think-- %$* 126
i don't think it's something the government needs to do. %$* 126
i think the idea of a nonprofit search engine is not a bad one, but i don't think it would fail to do personalization because i think a search engine that wasn't capable of personalization would be tremendously ineffective and disappointing. %$* 126
and nobody would use it. %$* 126
if it didn't know where you were, if it didn't gather any information about what kinds of things you were interested in. %$* 126
i do think-- %$* 126
i don't disagree. %$* 603
i was just talking about transparency. %$* 603
i want to go to another question, but i want to-- %$* 13
i want to confess that i would love to hear a female voice or two more in the mix tonight. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
i may be-- %$* 13
suddenly every hand went down. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i tried. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
oh, right here? %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i didn't see you. %$* 13
let the mic come. %$* 13
stand up. %$* 13
let us know your name and justify my choosing you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i was recently reading an article by ethan zimmerman, i think it was. %$* 19
zuckerman. %$* 18
okay, i'm seeing nods, yes. %$* 19
and suppose you don't know. %$* 19
it's an article about a theory known as cute cat theory, which is basically they applied it to the arab spring and saying that all of these movements, people that might want to watch cute cat videos, that's the majority of the people on the internet. %$* 19
that's what they use it for. %$* 19
there is a small majority who use it for internet activism. %$* 19
now, a site like youtube that uses the majority of people want to watch cute cat videos, but it also posts things like-- %$* 19
like-- %$* 19
i need you to target in on a question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
anyway, as far as maybe you guys can explain the cute cat theory a little better than i can. %$* 19
but cute cat theory, i'm interested to know-- %$* 19
i think that the cute cat theory opens up the possibility for neighbors, when the websites get shut down to talk about political issues. %$* 19
so for those of you arguing against the motion, i would be interested to hear your thoughts. %$* 19
for-- %$* 13
for the people who have to edit this for television-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
could you just restate the question and-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 19
no, no. %$* 13
i think this is actually a great question. %$* 13
and i like the idea that they'll tell you what cute cat theory is. %$* 13
but if you could ask them about cute cat theory. %$* 13
no, yeah. %$* 19
i'm sorry. %$* 19
i'm a little nervous %$* 19
sure. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
my question basically is about cute cat theory and whether those who watch cute cat videos, when a site like youtube gets shut down, if they-- %$* 19
they're more likely to then go find out why youtube got shut down, thus turning them into internet activists. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
eli pariser, tell us what cute cat theory is and whether it's relevant. %$* 13
i'm not-- %$* 670
i don't feel well versed in cute cat theory, unfortunately. %$* 670
who's good on the cats? %$* 13
siva actually got tenure for his work on cute cat theory. %$* 126
if i understand the-- %$* 670
i think this is a question about whether people will rally to support these online media that they depend on when they're under threat. %$* 670
so it basically throws my cats are the opiate of the masses theory. %$* 671
you get home, you watch videos of cats. %$* 671
internet gets shut down. %$* 671
you go and overthrow mubarak. %$* 671
if you think it's a good theory, good luck. %$* 671
we actually know that there-- %$* 603
it's really hard to watch youtube in china right now. %$* 603
and for a while, it wasn't so hard. %$* 603
first of all, youtube comes over really slowly in the people's republic because its servers are hosted in north america. %$* 603
google knows not to put the servers in china. %$* 603
that would be bad news. %$* 603
during the tibetan uprising three years ago, youtube basically went dark. %$* 603
during the olympics, it went dark. %$* 603
and it's been intermittent since. %$* 603
and nobody has banged on the doors of the chinese government saying, "i want my youtube." they're busy with their own video services. %$* 603
they're busy with their own business. %$* 603
they're busy clicking on their own issues, right? %$* 603
so it doesn't necessarily follow in that example. %$* 603
the other thing to remember, when talking about the arab spring, going to a different part of the world, is that only 30 percent of the egyptian population was online at the time. %$* 603
and then 11 days into the protest, zero percent were. %$* 603
sms was a much more important media form for doing anything. %$* 603
and al jazeera was probably the most important media forum for informing people. %$* 603
so what happened in north africa had very little to do with cats, cute or otherwise. %$* 603
okay. %$* 13
ma'am, right down in the front. %$* 13
in the third row, sorry. %$* 13
right behind you, sir. %$* 13
you guys have talked a lot about-- %$* 19
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
debbie. %$* 19
you guys talked a lot about personalization of the internet and why that's bad. %$* 19
but i'm asking those who are for the motion, what about people who go and seek out information in terms of wanting to comment on articles and videos that are against their own beliefs? %$* 19
yes-- %$* 670
eli pariser. %$* 13
again, it's not that it's impossible or even that hard to find information that you disagree with online. %$* 670
there's a great cartoon that someone's staying up late at night and person tries to get them to come to bed, and they say, but someone on the internet is wrong. %$* 670
that's like the experience that a lot of us have a lot of the time, but the question is whether the daily routines that we move through online will tend to bring us into contact more with people who make us feel that way or more with people who actually validate who we feel. %$* 670
and as social networking becomes a bigger phenomenon, and i think in specific facebook, let’s separate facebook from twitter, it's easier than ever to surround yourself with people who mostly agree with you, that's who your friends are. %$* 670
now, just to address twitter in particular, like i agree with these guys that twitter is like a pretty good medium for filtering the internet and i use it to-- %$* 670
i follow karl rove on twitter and i get karl rove's tweets and it's great. %$* 670
and, you know, i also follow him on facebook, and i never see his facebook posts because facebook actually does a lot more personalization than twitter does. %$* 670
now, you know-- %$* 670
is that a relief to you or-- %$* 13
yes, it-- %$* 670
well, twitter's a relief-- %$* 670
do you want more karl rove? %$* 13
twitter's great, but twitter's not how most people use the internet. %$* 670
no, no, i mean, the-- %$* 13
i mean, the lack of karl rove's presence in your facebook feed, do you want more? %$* 13
the fact that he writes boring messages on facebook and facebook doesn't find them interesting doesn't necessarily mean that personalization is so bad. %$* 671
but there are a lot of caveats where you can say, "oh, well, twitter's great, but it doesn't count because it's not big enough." i mean, just to go back to the numbers a minute, twitter claims either, their numbers, 200-- %$* 126
more than 200 million registered users, more than 100 million active users. %$* 126
facebook claims 800 million registered users, 400 million active users. %$* 126
i actually think facebook's definition of an active user is much more generous to itself than twitter, so maybe it is four times users, but, i mean, it's not insignificant. %$* 126
americans spend seven hours a month on facebook. %$* 670
they spend minutes on twitter, like that's just-- %$* 670
you know, if you look at the comscore numbers, if you look at-- %$* 670
i mean, it's just nowhere near as powerful a medium. %$* 670
as i said, people who use facebook frequently, all see all most recent messages. %$* 671
there is no personalization. %$* 671
if you use it not seven hours a day but just one day a month, then -there is personalization. %$* 671
and then there is no justification for you to see every single karl rove message because you only have 30 minutes and you have 5,000 friends and you have one hour a month to spend on it. %$* 671
there is no way for you to do it except for personalization. %$* 671
right, no, i agree with that. %$* 670
i'm just saying that a fact of that personalization-- %$* 670
so for seven-- %$* 671
for people who spend seven hours on facebook every day, there is no personalization. %$* 671
no, that's not correct. %$* 670
there is no personalization whatsoever. %$* 671
i went on edgerank and-- %$* 670
evgeny's right about that. %$* 18
no, it's not true. %$* 670
there's-- %$* 670
all right, we're at an impasse. %$* 13
and that ends round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is, "when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."and here's where we are, we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate because this is their last chance to persuade you that they've presented the better argument. %$* 13
and you'll be asked once again to vote and to pick the winner in just a few minutes. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, "when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." and here to summarize his position against the motion, jacob weisberg, chairman and editor in chief of the slate group. %$* 13
i did like one suggestion eli made which is that there should be buttons other than “like” on facebook. %$* 126
there should be a, "i'm not buying it," button, and i would have been clicking that the whole time i was hearing this argument. %$* 126
the internet doesn't change human nature, it just creates new opportunities for us. %$* 126
and if your view of human nature is that people are naturally inclined to be ignorant and bigoted and extreme, you're going to focus on the way the web lets them become even narrower and more close minded. %$* 126
but if that's your view of things, your problem isn't with the web, it's with democracy, because people like that aren't going to do a very good job of governing themselves. %$* 126
if on the other hand you think people are capable of informing and governing themselves, you have to appreciate the way that the web, which is the greatest trove of open information that the world has ever known, empowers us and broadens our political perspective. %$* 126
evgeny and i have talked about some of those ways tonight, and i think siva and eli have talked about a theoretical problem that just hasn't been supported by the evidence or borne out. %$* 126
does anyone here actually think that our political system would be better off without the web's democratization of information and the multiplicity of voices, if tim berners-lee had never invented the world wide web, do you think we'd be better off if the web or google or facebook and twitter or blogs were somehow magically taken away or regulated in some paternalistic way? %$* 126
and i want to ask you again to think about your personal experience because it may not be an academic study but collectively it's meaningful. %$* 126
do you think the internet is making you more narrow or is it exposing you to ideas, people, and arguments, and points of view that you wouldn’t have access to without it? %$* 126
in closing i just want to say that the idea that you and i would be less narrow in our politics without the web, isn’t just wrong, it’s actually preposterous. %$* 126
and that’s why you have to vote against tonight’s motion. %$* 126
thank you jacob weisberg. %$* 13
our motion is "when it comes to politics the internet is closing our minds" and here to summarize his position for the motion, eli pariser, moveon.org, board member and author of the filter bubble. %$* 13
so i want to read you a quote from two stanford researchers from 1997.they said, "we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. %$* 670
we believe that the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it’s crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm."now, the two researchers were sergey brin and larry page, and this was just months before they launched google as a for-profit entity. %$* 670
i think that version of them was right. %$* 670
i think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put information online have mixed motives. %$* 670
and the motives that they use in creating these filters may not be, and in fact aren’t in our best interests. %$* 670
they’re more likely to surround us with voices that tell us that we’re great and we’re right and we’re good enough and strong enough. %$* 670
and they’re less likely to confront us with the places where we’re wrong. %$* 670
what’s been interesting for me since writing the book is that i’ve actually been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies, amazon, apple, google, youtube, and facebook. %$* 670
i’ve had conversations with people in each of those places. %$* 670
and it’s sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isn’t a big part of what these companies are trying to do. %$* 670
the engineers know that it is. %$* 670
they wrestle with it every day. %$* 670
they wrestle with the mixed motives, with these questions of how they should be building these platforms. %$* 670
and they know as one netflix vice president told me, that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles where they tend to believe the same thing. %$* 670
so if you believe that the companies whose algorithms decide what we pay attention to, will tend to expose us to a broad diverse set of sources, you should vote with them. %$* 670
but if you agree with me that we should scrutinize that, and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view, then you should vote that the internet has in fact, unfortunately, been closing our minds. %$* 670
thank you eli pariser. %$* 13
this is our motion. %$* 13
"when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." and here to summarize his position against the motion, evgeny morozov, author of the net delusion, visiting scholar at stanford and schwartz fellow at the new america foundation. %$* 13
well i wish that don draper had a chance to respond to that 1997 paper from google. %$* 671
again, you may think that advertising is evil, but again, advertising is the kind of evil that’s also inevitable. %$* 671
so eli has mostly avoided the what’s to be done question. %$* 671
in his book, he actually is much more i think straightforward. %$* 671
and he does want google and facebook to intervene and to expose us to more diverse information. %$* 671
more diverse information diet even, that you are normally up for. %$* 671
this second attempt is an utopian dream that is not realizable in practice. %$* 671
do we really want facebook and google to start nudging us to pay more attention to joseph kony in uganda when we are searching for information about our local city council? %$* 671
okay, but then why pay more attention to joseph kony and say not climate change, or syria? %$* 671
who will adjudicate here? %$* 671
do we really think that silicon valley is capable of this? %$* 671
do we really think silicon valley should be in this business? %$* 671
again, you have to think about the proposed solution. %$* 671
often they’re worse than the cure. %$* 671
don’t forget, that in 1995, in that article in the nation, andrew shapiro proposed that the government should re-nationalize the internet, to bring it back to avoid all that advertising evil that you’ve just alluded to. %$* 671
cass sunstein in his book, wanted to force, by government, bloggers to link to their ideological opponents. %$* 671
he wanted them, conservatives to link to liberals, and liberals to link to conservatives. %$* 671
all of those ideas now seem very ridiculous. %$* 671
and that’s what i think we will think about the idea that google and facebook should be in the business of actually preserving us and presenting us with a more diverse information diet. %$* 671
information is not like food. %$* 671
politics is not like food. %$* 671
diversity here is a very political matter that will not be settled very easily. %$* 671
ideological conflict here is inevitable and i think this is why you should vote against this proposition. %$* 671
the sooner we do it, the sooner we can start attacking more important threats like privacy. %$* 671
thank you evgeny morozov. %$* 13
our motion is "when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." and here to summarize his position for the motion, siva vaidhyanathan, chair of the university of virginia's department of media studies and author of the googlization of everything. %$* 13
evgeny has just done a great job to convince me that there is no virtue in the arguments made by people who are not me and not eli and not made during this debate. %$* 603
we have not advocated a government takeover of anything. %$* 603
we have not advocated any cass sunstein-type intervention. %$* 603
we merely want you to be aware of the problem and correct for it. %$* 603
jacob said, what if we had a world without the web? %$* 603
what if we had the world without the web? %$* 603
we might get there. %$* 603
let me tell you why, because facebook and google and microsoft and apple all wish to be the operating systems of our lives. %$* 603
they're explicit about this. %$* 603
they don't just want to be on the web because the web is 20 years old, and it's actually kind of creaky. %$* 603
what they want to do is be there with you all the time in your glasses, in your pocket, in your purse and on your mind always. %$* 603
they want to be your personal assistant. %$* 603
there's quote after quote after quote from every ceo of every one of these companies that that's what they want. %$* 603
and it might make things really cool for us. %$* 603
but it's not going to make things rich and diverse. %$* 603
it's not going to be the wonderful conversation that we could have had on the web if we hadn't instigated these gated communities, these operating systems of our lives. %$* 603
we're on the way to having a balkanized world and a balkanized society because of these gated communities. %$* 603
the fact is, nothing is determined here. %$* 603
we can decide that we like what the web was supposed to be. %$* 603
we can opt out of certain of these practices. %$* 603
we should encourage diversity, encourage other platforms. %$* 603
we should encourage experimentation. %$* 603
we should recognize that facebook and google and yahoo! %$* 603
and bing and apple and microsoft are designed to gratify us immediately. %$* 603
and that's great for pizza, but it's not for politics. %$* 603
thank you very much. %$* 603
please vote for the resolution. %$* 603
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you believe has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote on which side you feel presented the stronger argument tonight. %$* 13
and we will get the readout pretty much immediately. %$* 13
press one if you support the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. %$* 13
press number two if you are against this motion. %$* 13
and press number three if you remain or became undecided. %$* 13
and you can correct your vote if you think you pressed the wrong button, and it will be locked in right away. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
so first, i want to ask-- %$* 13
i want to ask for a round of applause for our debaters, for the quality of-- %$* 13
of the arguments that they brought here tonight. %$* 13
it was witty, and it was informative, and it went places. %$* 13
thank you very much to them. %$* 13
thank you also to everyone in the audience who had the guts to stand up and ask a question and to all the people who i didn't get to answer-- %$* 13
to ask questions, i wasn't able to allow to ask questions, thank you, very much for your contribution to those as well. %$* 13
so going forward, i just want to let you know that our next debate is in may. %$* 13
it's our last debate of the season. %$* 13
and our motion comes down to three words, "ban college football." and we had actually set this debate up quite a while back. %$* 13
it has-- %$* 13
it was not in relation to the penn state scandal. %$* 13
it was actually motivated more by reporting that was done about the business side of college football and the sometimes harsh nature of the sport on the bodies of the athletes who play it. %$* 13
so our debaters will include somebody who wrote one of those articles, malcolm gladwell, who is author of "the tipping point," and "blink," and he will be on the panel arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and he wrote the piece in the new yorker in which he compares college football to dog fighting. %$* 13
his partner will be buzz bissinger. %$* 13
he is the pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author of friday night lights. %$* 13
that served as the inspiration for a movie of the same name and a critically acclaimed television series also of the same name. %$* 13
opposing them, we have a football player, tim green. %$* 13
he is the former atlanta falcons nfl defensive end, and syracuse university all american. %$* 13
he was inducted into the college football hall of fame in 2002.and his partner also debating against the motion, jason whitlock. %$* 13
he is foxsports.com’s national columnist, and he's already as an offensive tackle at ball state university. %$* 13
so that's our last debate. %$* 13
that's on may 17th. %$* 13
and we would love to see you there. %$* 13
also we're trying something new tonight after the debate. %$* 13
any of you want to join us, we are partnering with the new american tavern to host a post debate reception that will be upstairs at amity hall. %$* 13
that's a block away from here on third street between thompson and sullivan. %$* 13
details are in the programs that you have. %$* 13
but our idea was that we noticed a lot of times people walk out of here still kind of energized and revisiting the issues and debating among yourselves. %$* 13
we wanted to give you a place to do it and get together. %$* 13
and to share your ideas across the partisan divide. %$* 13
so that'll be at amity hall, $5 beer and well drinks. %$* 13
and i will be there for a bit as well along with other members of the intelligence squared staff. %$* 13
and finally, you are encouraged to tweet about this debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us. and the hash tag is iq2us. so we'll just wait about-- %$* 13
it's ready already. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so the results are all in. %$* 13
our motion is this: "when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." you have heard the arguments for and against over the course of this debate. %$* 13
we ask you to vote before and again afterwards where you stand on this and how persuasive the teams were. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate, 28 percent voted for the motion. %$* 13
37 percent against and 35 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 53 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that is up 25 percent. %$* 13
36 percent are against it. %$* 13
that is down 1 percent. %$* 13
we have 11 percent undecided. %$* 13
the motion, when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds has carried. %$* 13
our congratulations to that team. %$* 13
thank you for me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

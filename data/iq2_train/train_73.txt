we are now in our fifth season. %$* 13
we've done more than 50 of these debates. %$* 13
and we're delighted to have all of you here. %$* 13
but they all happen because of one man, robert rosenkranz, who is the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, who brought intelligence squared to the city and to this country, in fact. %$* 13
and so i'd like to welcome him to make opening remarks and set the frame for what we're actually talking about here. %$* 13
bless you for coming. %$* 1
intelligence squared is primarily known as a public policy debate series, so i'd like to start the evening by sharing with you the reasons we wanted to do a debate about religion. %$* 1
america has always incorporated complex ideas about religion in its political culture. %$* 1
creationism is invoked in the most famous words of our founding documents, "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights."the first amendment to the constitution begins with the ringing words, "congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." but note these words do not banish religion from the public square. %$* 1
indeed, many of the original 13 colonies had official state religions which the amendment protects from the actions of congress. %$* 1
nor is there any constitutional issue when the president, in his role as commander in chief, hires ministers and rabbis and priests to perform religious duties as member of the armed forces. %$* 1
tonight's debate should prove equally complex. %$* 1
proponents of the motion might cite the violence perpetrated in the name of religion while opponents will counter that most warfare throughout history was totally or primarily about territory and economic advantage. %$* 1
proponents might cite the absence of proof for central religious beliefs, indeed, the repugnance of some of them, while opponents emphasize the utility of faith and ritual and helping believers cope with the challenges of life. %$* 1
but both sides are likely to concur that every well-ordered society needs some key moral principles and that every thoughtful person needs a sense of meaning and purpose in life. %$* 1
the key question for tonight's debate, the complex question, is whether those central needs can be better met in a world with or without religion. %$* 1
we have a very outstanding panelist group tonight with us. %$* 1
and it's my privilege at this point to turn the evening back to john donvan and to our great panel. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i just-- %$* 13
i would really like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this all possible. %$* 13
true or false, the world would be better off without religion? %$* 13
that's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
the world would be better off without religion. %$* 13
two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, one for and one against. %$* 13
and only one team will win. %$* 13
you are live judges. %$* 13
you, our live audience, will be the judges. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
they include on the team arguing for the motion, the great-great-grandson of charles darwin, author and filmmaker, matthew chapman. %$* 13
by his side and on his side, a philosopher who takes a humanistic view of ethics, master of the new college of the humanities, a.c.grayling. %$* 13
them, and here to argue against the motion is one of the most influential conservative thinkers in the nation, president of the king's college, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
and his teammate is the rabbi of sinai temple in los angeles, california, david wolpe. %$* 13
so this is a contest. %$* 13
it's a debate. %$* 13
and you, our audience here at the skirball center, will decide the winner. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, we'll have asked you to vote two times, once before and once again at the end. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds, the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go on to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
you have a keypad at your seat on the right hand side. %$* 13
and our motion is, again, "the world would be better off without religion." and if you agree with this motion, and it's a negative, without, if you agree with this motion, means you want less religion, push number one. %$* 13
it's these guys. %$* 13
if you disagree with this motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other numbers. %$* 13
and if you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
so remember, we're going to let you know at the end of the debate what that baseline number is, and we're going to have you vote a second time after the third round. %$* 13
we go in three rounds, opening statements, a middle round where you're involved, and the debaters address one another directly, and then a closing round of short summary statements. %$* 13
so let's get started. %$* 13
onto round one. %$* 13
our motion is, "the world would be better off without religion." and here to speak in support of the motion, a.c.grayling, anthony grayling, philosopher. %$* 13
put that on your business card, i guess. %$* 13
but it's true. %$* 13
in addition to your current position at the new college of the humanities, the number of books that you have written on philosophy is now approaching three dozen? %$* 13
and i understand that as an undergraduate at the university of sussex, you decided you needed more college, more university. %$* 13
so simultaneously, you pursued a second bachelor of arts degree up in london, so you did college twice at the same time? %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
what else did-- %$* 13
yes, it's true. %$* 278
it's crazy. %$* 278
what did you do in your spare time? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 278
it's crazy, but it's true. %$* 278
ladies and gentlemen, a.c. grayling. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 278
john, thank you very much indeed. %$* 278
i must begin by asking you, if i may, to focus on what the proposition is before us. %$* 278
we're not here to discuss the existence of god. %$* 278
we are not here to discuss whether it's rational, irrational to have faith. %$* 278
we're here to discuss a sociological phenomenon, a man-made phenomenon, religion. %$* 278
you can see the difference. %$* 278
you might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses. %$* 278
but you can't call in question whether or not there is religion. %$* 278
there's plenty of it. %$* 278
history is full of it, and it exists around us all the time today. %$* 278
by the way, i say that religion is man- made advisedly. %$* 278
there are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world's religions, which perhaps has something to do with the point. %$* 278
now, religions are very diverse in nature. %$* 278
they have different interpretations of their deities. %$* 278
they say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when, how many wives we can have, what rituals we must follow. %$* 278
despite the fact that they all take the view that they've got the right story, they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects. %$* 278
and this is why, through the course of history, they've burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness. %$* 278
but i'm not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest. %$* 278
it's a very familiar matter. %$* 278
although it is, of course, in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them. %$* 278
rather, i wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them. %$* 278
they have two things in common with one another. %$* 278
most of the time in history, and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today, they are similar to one another in-- %$* 278
most of them, giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays, in being very opposed to most kinds of progress, especially scientific progress. %$* 278
the reason being, of course, that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago, anything between one and 3,000 years ago. %$* 278
and so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world, they find unpalatable. %$* 278
and so they tend to be very traditionalist, very conservative and rather retrogressive. %$* 278
and that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in. %$* 278
that's one thing that they tend to have in common with one another. %$* 278
but another thing they have in common with one another, a very important point, is that they share a structural feature. %$* 278
in fact, they are-- %$* 278
the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization, what i call a monolithic ideology, a one-size-fits all, top- down, totalizing ideology which says we've got the right story, and you've got to sign up for it. %$* 278
if you don't sign up for our story, if you don't agree, you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another. %$* 278
and during the course of history, those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible. %$* 278
it's in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now, plus in all their manifestations, tend to share with other kinds of totalizing ideologies. %$* 278
so that's why it's no great surprise that joseph stalin, for example, was educated in the seminary. %$* 278
what those totalitarianisms share is very, very common. %$* 278
inquisition in spain in the 15th century and stalin's soviet union in the 20th century say the same thing, "we've got the answer, you've got to agree, and if you don't, you're in trouble."so they have these two features, and the second of them, the structural feature, the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern western liberal democracies are based, the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there isn't one right answer for everybody. %$* 278
it taught us pluralism, taught us individual autonomy, it taught us liberty of conscience, it taught us democracy. %$* 278
democracy is about people having a conversation, the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward, how we organize ourselves in society, and that's very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler, one monarch, whether in the sky or on the ground, who tells us what we should do, and that we mustn't think for ourselves, but we must all be orthodox, and indeed this ethical point is a very important one. %$* 278
there are those people who think that you can't have religion-- %$* 278
you can't have morality without religion, and of course, that isn't true. %$* 278
everything good about religious morality, loving your neighbor, kindness, concern for others, responsibility as a member of the community, is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also. %$* 278
they're very common to all the great ethical theories. %$* 278
i'm an atheist and a humanist, and those values matter deeply to me. %$* 278
if you look at ancient greek philosophy for example, a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before christianity came to command the mind of europe, and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers, not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them. %$* 278
and the final point is this. %$* 278
people say, "what's wrong with moderate religion? %$* 278
" you know, those nice folks who go to church on sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods. %$* 278
and here's the problem with that, moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking. %$* 278
they take the best bits of the religion, and some of the more embarrassing, or difficult, or awkward, or rebarbative bits they leave to one side. %$* 278
i know very, very few christians who give away all they own to the poor, who take no thought for tomorrow, who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything, who don't marry, who stay celibate. %$* 278
i find very few christians actually live the new testament morality, they cherry pick. %$* 278
unkind people would call that "hypocrisy." at the other end of the scale, however, are those who take their religion extremely seriously, the extremists, we call it them. %$* 278
the point about the extremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them, and they stay closest to the text. %$* 278
now, if that's real religion, that's honest religion, the world is very much better off without it. %$* 278
and if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion, why not put the hypocrites in with them, too? %$* 278
thank you. %$* 278
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, anthony grayling. %$* 13
our motion is "the world would be better off without religion," and here to speak against the motion, david wolpe. %$* 13
he's the rabbi of sinai temple in los angeles, california. %$* 13
newsweek magazine named you-- %$* 13
what is this, the way it was phrased, the number one pulpit rabbi in america. %$* 13
i hope we're not voting on that tonight. %$* 279
i just want to-- %$* 13
i mean, do they have playoffs or-- %$* 13
oh, yes. %$* 279
yeah, stadiums, playoffs, national league, american league. %$* 279
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
this pulpit is yours-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 279
david wolpe. %$* 13
the caustic and brilliant philosopher at columbia university, sidney morgenbesser, was once sitting in the back of a lecture where the english philosopher, j.l. austin, said that we know that two negatives make a positive, if i say i will never not miss you, it means i'll always miss you. %$* 279
but he said there's no language in which two positives make a negative. %$* 279
and from the back of the auditorium morgenbesser said, yeah, right. %$* 279
now, i'm going to offer you two positives. %$* 279
i hope not only that they will add to a positive but that you will approach this not in that skeptical frame of mind but at least open to the possibility that there's a lot about religion that you don't hear. %$* 279
you will never see a headline that says religious man feeds hungry man. %$* 279
but it happens all the time. %$* 279
in fact you might be surprised to know what the largest aid organization in the world is. %$* 279
it’s called world vision, with over 40,000 people in over 100 countries. %$* 279
that’s more than care, save the children, the worldwide operations of the united states agency for international development all combined. %$* 279
and if you didn’t know that, it’s because the good that religion does is sort of oft interred with its bones, but you hear about every depredation, every sin, every bad thing. %$* 279
and yet today, all over the world, there are millions of religious aid workers who are sustaining people in places that you’ve never heard of and never visited. %$* 279
right before this conference, both dinesh and i were in mexico in puebla at the festival of ideas, and i rode back to the airport with nicholas kristof from the new york times and we were talking about this issue. %$* 279
and he said, “you know, everywhere i go, i see religious aid workers, day after day, year after year, and the difference,” he said, “between religious aid workers and others is they stay.” they don’t go when the crisis is over. %$* 279
and this parallels my own experience when i was in haiti, helping a friend rebuild an orphanage. %$* 279
almost every person i met was a religious aid worker. %$* 279
i remember going to the market in haiti and i met this man, and i said to him, “what are you doing here? %$* 279
” and he said, “well, i’m a mennonite, and i and my group are building homes in the rural areas outside of port-au-prince.” so i said, “why are you doing this? %$* 279
” he said, “well, i’ve been here for about five or six years, and i came because my son was sent by the church community 20 years ago. %$* 279
and after 15 years of watching my son do this, i thought it’s time for me to go.” this story could be duplicated again and again and again. %$* 279
and, in fact, if tomorrow you took religion out of the world, the world would be tremendously impoverished in terms of the way in which people who are in trouble get help. %$* 279
evangelical organizations were the first ones on the ground after the tsunami in indonesia, and that story could be repeated again and again throughout the world. %$* 279
that’s point one. %$* 279
here’s point two. %$* 279
the oxford handbook of religion and health is about to come out in 2012, the second edition. %$* 279
in case you won’t find the time to read it, i’m now going to save you the time. %$* 279
this is a handbook that anthologizes over 3,000 studies from the new england journal of medicine, jama, lancet, all peer-review journals that are not particularly sympathetic to religion. %$* 279
and this is what it says. %$* 279
religious americans give more to charity, volunteer more, participate in civic processes more, attend more meetings, are more likely to vote, to volunteer, less likely to drink, divorce, do drugs. %$* 279
they are much more inclined to be optimistic and feel meaningful about life. %$* 279
they’re less inclined to depression, less inclined to suicide, less inclined to suicidal thoughts. %$* 279
they are much more helpful in their communities. %$* 279
if you want to measure altruism and empathy, the best measure is not age, gender, income, education. %$* 279
it’s whether you’re involved in a religious community. %$* 279
i’ll give you one study at the university of miami. %$* 279
they studied people who’d been diagnosed with aids, whether they turned to religion or away from religion. %$* 279
those who turned to religion, several months later, had lower viral loads, lower cd4 counts. %$* 279
they were healthier than those who didn’t. %$* 279
in fact, religion, if you’re part of a religious community as measured by attending services and reading scripture and praying, it adds on average seven years to your life if you’re a white american male, 14 years if you’re an african american male. %$* 279
now, the dean of this research, harold koenig at duke university says that he has to point out to you that you may spend those seven years in church, but nonetheless, you have to decide what you want to do with the time. %$* 279
still, you have the time to do it. %$* 279
all of this is a way of emphasizing that religion and being part of a religious community does enormous good. %$* 279
i see it day after day, week after week. %$* 279
the little nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love about which wordsworth wrote, that’s what religious people do and in part because it’s a system that encourages goodness, which is why when a religious person does something wrong, people get particular upset. %$* 279
“how can he do this? %$* 279
” he’s supposed to be religious. %$* 279
every time someone complains about the synagogue, the call begins as follows: “how, in a synagogue, could you %$* 279
” which is a way of saying you’re supposed to aspire to be better. %$* 279
and that’s exactly right. %$* 279
mother teresa was once tending to the wounds of a leper in calcutta. %$* 279
and wiping the separating wounds from this sick and dying person. %$* 279
and a journalist who'd been following her around for several days said to her, "i wouldn't do that for a million dollars." and without looking up, she said, "neither would i." it's true. %$* 279
many people of all different beliefs and no beliefs do good in this world. %$* 279
but if you want to find an organized system that encourages people to be better, to transcend themselves, that seeks to make the world colorful, kind, compassionate, giving, good, a system that often fails but at least aspires to that, not in little enclaves of this class or this school, but worldwide, consistently, the only one we have ever had is religion. %$* 279
the world without it would be a poorer, sadder and crueler place. %$* 279
thank you. %$* 279
thank you, david wolpe. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "the world would be better off without religion."we've heard from the first two speakers, and now onto the third. %$* 13
speaking for the motion, matthew chapman. %$* 13
he is a writer and cofounder and president of science debate, and in a sense is our real renaissance man tonight. %$* 13
you've also directed films, written books, written magazine articles. %$* 13
you were particularly fascinated by a case i also covered of the dover school board wanting to push back against the theory of evolution. %$* 13
and you wrote extensively about that. %$* 13
of course, you do have some vested interest in your-- %$* 13
it's on your mother's side, your great-great-grandfather? %$* 13
my great-great-grandfather on my mother's side, yes. %$* 280
all right. %$* 13
so you have some sparkling dna walking around tonight as you come to this argument. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, matthew chapman. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 280
i am not a professional like these guys, so i'm going to read my notes. %$* 280
i apologize. %$* 280
religion makes two big claims: god really exists, and religion makes us behave better. %$* 280
but does religion make us behave better? %$* 280
to partially answer that question, let me read you a verse or two from the bible. %$* 280
deuteronomy, chapter 25, verses 11 and 12."when men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth a hand and taketh him by the secrets, then shalt thou cut off her hand." roughly translated, this means that if you're in a fight, and your wife tries to help you by grabbing your opponent's balls, you should chop her hand off. %$* 280
it's there. %$* 280
i mean, i can show you. %$* 280
i know it's kind of cheap to poke fun at the bible because it's so easy, but-- %$* 280
but there is-- %$* 280
there is a serious point here, which is that far from making us behave better, religion often complicates and distorts morality. %$* 280
by any reasonable standards, hacking bits off your wife is far worse than her squeezing your enemy's nuts. %$* 280
the thing is that in almost any holy book, you can find something that will validate just about anything. %$* 280
and afterwards, you don't have to defend the humanity of your actions or take responsibility because god told you to do it. %$* 280
believe it or not, there's more atheism up here than faith. %$* 280
a.c.grayling and i are atheists. %$* 280
david and dinesh are too, except when it comes to their own religion. %$* 280
every other religion, they're atheist about. %$* 280
this is why religion is divisive. %$* 280
everyone on earth wants food, water, shelter, love, for their children to grow up to be happy and in a peaceful world. %$* 280
these common desires are so profound they ought to make war an absurdity, a violence against self. %$* 280
religion, however, makes everyone an infidel to someone. %$* 280
but we're no longer ignorant, isolated tribes who think the earth is flat and don't know what lies around the corner. %$* 280
we have photographs of our planet from space. %$* 280
and most of us have met people of many races. %$* 280
we know our world and who we share it with. %$* 280
and we also know that critical worldwide problems will require worldwide unity. %$* 280
in this context, religion's continuing assistance, insistence that my god is better than yours is disastrous, which leads me to credulity. %$* 280
there are literally thousands of gods available. %$* 280
which one you believe in is really just an accident of birth. %$* 280
if david and dinesh had been born in afghanistan, they'd both be muslim probably. %$* 280
or they'd be dead. %$* 280
like most people-- %$* 280
like most believers, however, they have faith in their inherited gods. %$* 280
they haven't tested the rest because there's far too many of them. %$* 280
how then do they know that their god exists and the other gods don't or that their god is better than the other gods? %$* 280
because they've been told by an authority figure. %$* 280
and here's how he did it. %$* 280
he said, our god is supreme, but he's invisible. %$* 280
we have no proof he exists. %$* 280
but if you have faith, if you make a big effort to believe in him, you will believe in him. %$* 280
it's fantastic. %$* 280
they take the weakest point of the argument and make it a condition of entry so you overlook it. %$* 280
but if, in the most important area of your life, your philosophy no less, the first thing you learn as a child is that faith is absolutely essential, and evidence absolutely isn't, how can this not affect the way you think about everything? %$* 280
you've been brain washed to be credulous and submissive to authority. %$* 280
this affects many aspects of life, including the functioning of democracy and the understanding of science, both of which demand that you insist on evidence, question everything and take nothing on faith from anyone. %$* 280
here's an example. %$* 280
evolution through natural selection over billions of years is one of the best supported theories in science. %$* 280
but 40 to 50 percent of americans believe the earth is only six to 8,000 years old and that god made us as we are now. %$* 280
nearly 50 percent-- %$* 280
i mean, it's really extraordinary. %$* 280
it's unheard of in any other culture except muslim countries. %$* 280
i've written widely on this subject and met creationists of all types. %$* 280
often, they have-- %$* 280
i'd say usually they have no idea what evolution is. %$* 280
but they dispute it with passion from a religious standpoint, faith over reason. %$* 280
evidence infuriates them, as does science itself. %$* 280
and this antipathy to science has slowed down stem cell research, continues to harm the health of women and girls and contributes to cynicism about scientific issues like global warming. %$* 280
but none of this captures the human suffering caused by religion. %$* 280
i grew up next to my gay uncle and his partner. %$* 280
when i was nine, i discovered they faced long prison sentences if their homosexuality was revealed. %$* 280
this was justified by leviticus 20:13.and the verse was often quoted by both politicians and the clergy. %$* 280
"if a man lieth with a man as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. %$* 280
they shall surely be put to death." this barbaric verse is still used by christians, including catholics and evangelicals. %$* 280
and violence is only its most obvious consequence. %$* 280
i end where i began. %$* 280
religion claims to provide morality. %$* 280
but as can be seen in its divisiveness, its homophobia and in its almost universal subjugation of women, it just as often deforms morality. %$* 280
the question isn't whether religion can sometimes do good. %$* 280
of course it can and has. %$* 280
the question is, can we come up with something better that does not depend on dangerous and childish faith and thousands of competing gods? %$* 280
can we persuade people that it's possible to live a good, peaceful and happy life guided only by human conscience and modern knowledge? %$* 280
when people who believe in martyrdom and an afterlife will soon get weapons of mass destruction, i think we have to, that we can and that we will. %$* 280
and that's why i ask you to support the motion that "the world would be better off without religion." thank you. %$* 280
thank you, matthew chapman. %$* 13
this is our motion, "the world would be better off without religion." and now here to speak against the motion, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
he's the president of the king's college. %$* 13
he is a leading conservative thinker in the country from a very young age, starting in his college years. %$* 13
as a young man also, he was an advisor to president reagan. %$* 13
you've also written a lot of books. %$* 13
now, your opponent has written three times as many books as you. %$* 13
but i hate to tell you, anthony, that dinesh has written about five times as many best sellers as you have. %$* 13
so i think you trump on that. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 201
it's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers. %$* 201
i must say this puts me an odd position. %$* 201
i feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony. %$* 201
i'm not sure where to begin. %$* 201
i guess i'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually i think help our case. %$* 201
the first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical. %$* 201
but notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to. %$* 201
and this is advanced as hypocrisy, in other words, holding up to a standard and falling short of it. %$* 201
now, that is actually not hypocrisy. %$* 201
if you read the bible, jesus doesn't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high. %$* 201
he calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another. %$* 201
the problem with the pharisees wasn't that they had high principles, is that they didn't have principles but they pretended to be something they weren't, so we've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy, a shift that is advanced by the atheist side, why? %$* 201
to basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves. %$* 201
that i would suggest is a very bad thing. %$* 201
now, matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you're born. %$* 201
if you were born in india, you're going to be a hindu-- %$* 201
actually i was born in india, i was raised catholic, but never mind-- %$* 201
that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you're born. %$* 201
if you're born in afghanistan you're a muslim and so on. %$* 201
well i think this applies to all our beliefs. %$* 201
let's say for example that somebody born in oxford, england is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in oxford, mississippi. %$* 201
somebody who is born in new york city is more likely to have formed einstein's theory of relativity than someone born in new guinea. %$* 201
now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true? %$* 201
nothing. %$* 201
the fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea, so there's a kind of sleight of hand here, you have to judge the ideas by their own merits. %$* 201
now, would the world be better without religion? %$* 201
you can't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world, but you've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion. %$* 201
there's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion, but let me suggest that those crimes, even the worst of them, are infinitesimal compared to the crimes of atheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude, far longer in duration, and actually are still going on. %$* 201
if you consider, for example, a tragedy like the inquisition, a crime, i admit it, and yet over 400 years the spanish inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people, 2,000. the salem witch trials i heard about when i came to america, and then my wife and i a few years ago went to salem, massachusetts, it's a really interesting place-- %$* 201
i do want to report, the witches today are doing great, most of them are tourist guides-- %$* 201
but if you pick up one of their brochures, the number of people killed in the salem witch trials, 19, 19. now, is that 19 too many? %$* 201
yeah, or if you want to add it up, 2,019. but while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion, they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism. %$* 201
now, am i talking about stalin in russia and mao in china? %$* 201
not even really, that's just the tip of the atheist iceberg. %$* 201
if you dig deeper, there is a massive procession underneath. %$* 201
in the soviet union alone, starting with lenin you continue through brezhnev, andropov, chernenko, a procession of soviet dictators, but what about ceausescu and fidel castro, kim jong il, pol pot, i mean, pol pot is such a junior league atheist people don't even mention him. %$* 201
and yet in the aftermath of the vietnam war, his khmer rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people, two million. %$* 201
even bin laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close, but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but richard dawkins in his book, "the god delusion," and he goes, "wait a minute. %$* 201
we've got to make a crucial distinction here."you might've had some tyrants who killed-- %$* 201
who happened to be atheist, but they didn't kill in the name of atheism. %$* 201
the christians killed in the name of christianity. %$* 201
now, richard dawkins is a respected biologist, and i think here you begin to see the problem, when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because evidently the poor man knows no history, all you have to do is crack open the collected works of karl marx, and you will see that the atheism is not incidental, it's not some add on, it's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme, marx famously calls religion, the opium, a kind of drug of the masses. %$* 201
and his point is you’ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality. %$* 201
often when we think of secular society, we think of europe. %$* 201
but europe isn’t really secular. %$* 201
europe is a product of 2,000 years of jewish and christian civilization. %$* 201
even today if there’s a famine in rwanda, while much of the world ignores it, the european countries, the western countries begin to send to food and aid, doctors without borders, the red cross. %$* 201
my point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains. %$* 201
nietzsche once said that if we get rid of god, we’ve got to get rid of shadows of god. %$* 201
in other words, the ideas that judaism and christianity brought into the west and into the world, those will begin to erode as well. %$* 201
dostoevsky said a long time ago, “if god is not, everything is permitted.” and dostoevsky’s point is that when we get rid of transcendence, when we create a world without religion, we license terrible calamities. %$* 201
so, in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of souls who have died, i would say from their point of view, the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 201
thank you, dinesh d’souza. %$* 13
and that concludes round one, opening statements of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
we’ll be right back. %$* 13
okay, so we’re going to do one of our spontaneous bursts of applause by you. %$* 13
to begin our second round, i just want to allow the crew to remove the lecterns. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
let’s all clap. %$* 13
our motion is “the world would be better off without religion.” this is a debate from intelligence square u.s.we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing out this motion. %$* 13
one team, a.c. grayling, anthony grayling and matthew chapman, arguing the world would be better off without religion. %$* 13
they make the argument that religion has been a burden for mankind, that it imprisons the minds of those who participate in it, keeping them within a narrow range of ideas, discouraged from thinking, believing in things that they say are evidentially not evidential, that are not real, also that religion divides us historically in ways that have had terrible consequences. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion that the world would be better off without religion, who are saying explicitly the world would be better off-- %$* 13
is better off with religion, dinesh d’souza and rabbi david wolpe. %$* 13
they are arguing that a world without religion would be a very, very bleak place, in part because of the absence of the sorts of goods that manifestly are carried out in the name of religion around the world, and that in places where godlessness has been established, terrible things, terrible crimes have been committed in the name of godlessness, or, more accurately, in the absence of the name of god. %$* 13
we’re going to go onto round two now. %$* 13
this is the round where the debaters address one another and also take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
we’re going to revisit some of what’s been said already and also get into some new areas. %$* 13
and i want to start with the side arguing for the motion, the side that’s arguing that we would be better off without religion. %$* 13
what does it say about the many billions of humans who embrace religion that they do so given your argument that it is destructive to them and that it is limiting to them and that there is a delusion in it? %$* 13
what do you say about them? %$* 13
why are they doing that? %$* 13
anthony grayling. %$* 13
well, first, of course, matthew is right to point out that the religion that anybody has, tends, on the whole-- %$* 278
in much more than 95 percent of cases to be the religion of your parents. %$* 278
and so, it’s a traditional thing. %$* 278
people are brought up in the religion of their father, and it’s historical. %$* 278
can i just want to ask you to go closer to the microphone-- %$* 13
and you can address the answer out to the audience. %$* 13
it doesn’t just have to be in my direction. %$* 13
and if you could start again. %$* 13
but you asked me the question. %$* 278
i know that. %$* 13
but know that my eyes are boring into the side of your head. %$* 13
okay, so i repeat the answer, which is, of course, religion is pervasive in history at its traditional-- %$* 278
it’s handed down from parents to their children so it remains the case that it’s a very potent force in society. %$* 278
but if you look at the trend in the developed and advanced and educated countries of the world, mainly the western countries, since the 17th and 18th century, enlightenment and the growth of science, you see the numbers are plummeting. %$* 278
they are plummeting even here in the united states of america. %$* 278
you look at the few polling data and it points out to us that the number of people who self- identify as not having a religious commitment or agnostic or atheist is increasing all the time, especially among the young. %$* 278
so the trends are setting in the right direction. %$* 278
all right. %$* 13
let me take that to the other side. %$* 13
and in the argument made by anthony grayling and also earlier by matthew chapman is that that religion kind of gets kids early when they'll believe anything. %$* 13
and then it's set. %$* 13
and then it's set and hard to move off. %$* 13
and i want you to take that point on. %$* 13
sure. %$* 201
remember, we also get kids early with habits like brushing your teeth, learning the mathematical tables. %$* 201
now, here is the point. %$* 201
i think that as a practical matter, we all learn our ethical values from our parents. %$* 201
i learned what i would call “crayon christianity” from my parents. %$* 201
but the fact of the matter is that's my parents' beliefs. %$* 201
when i became a teenager, when i went to dartmouth, that set of beliefs got battered, and crayon christianity became no christianity at all. %$* 201
so it was in adult life that i had to go back to the ideas that had been bred in me as a child and ask, which of my parents' beliefs do i agree with? %$* 201
but do you think you're typical? %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
i do. %$* 201
you went to dartmouth. %$* 13
you're a very bright guy. %$* 13
well-- %$* 201
and brushing your teeth, those are scientific experiments that have determined-- %$* 13
but they're arguing a somewhat different point, that there are lots of people who may not be able to do the critical thinking that you do. %$* 13
well, i think we're making a deep mistake here because just to say we learned it from our parents misses the thrust of why billions of people in the world continue to do it long into old age. %$* 201
in other words, religion delivers practical benefits. %$* 201
it gives us the hope of life after death. %$* 201
you might say that's an illusion, but you don't know. %$* 201
none of us knows what comes after death. %$* 201
we all have to die in any case. %$* 201
either we die with despair facing annihilation, or we have the hope of something else. %$* 201
that's a practical benefit. %$* 201
second, religion is a mode of transmission of morality. %$* 201
you might say there is morality that comes through kant or nietzsche or heidegger. %$* 201
but no one teaches their kids morality that way. %$* 201
people learn their morality-- %$* 201
all right. %$* 13
dinesh, let me bring it over to matthew chapman and bring him into this. %$* 13
and if you can respond to some of what you've heard here. %$* 13
well, i just think it's a distortion of what you actually see in life, which is you see people who grow up in cultures. %$* 280
they become addicted to their particular religions. %$* 280
they disagree with all kinds of other religions. %$* 280
even you, you started as a catholic. %$* 280
you end up as an evangelical. %$* 280
does that mean that you then say the stuff in the catholic part of it was actually wrong, and you were mistaken about that? %$* 280
i think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion, none of which can't be performed by people who don't believe in god because they can. %$* 280
but even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion, and you ended up with a character who is like father christmas, a nice harmless sort of person, would you want to find out that the president of the united states was a devout believer in father christmas? %$* 280
not me. %$* 280
all right, let me take this-- %$* 13
let me take this to-- %$* 13
i want to take it to david wolpe because the issue of whether there's a credulity here that people believe suggests that people's minds aren't growing. %$* 13
so i want to say, first of all, it's so interesting that the side that's quoting the bible is that side and the side that has actually provided evidence of any kind is this side. %$* 279
so let me give you another piece of evidence as opposed to the generalities. %$* 279
in their encyclopedia of wars, okay, the encyclopedia of wars, charles phillips and alan axelrod, they chronicle over 1700 serious conflicts throughout history. %$* 279
do you want to know what percentage actually reduced to religious wars? %$* 279
seven percent. %$* 279
david, david, i-- %$* 13
the reason i'm saying this is because it's not about credulity. %$* 279
no, it's not about credulity. %$* 279
the idea that people who are religious are religious because of some psychological deficit, but people who are not religious are not religious because they reason their way to the lack of religion, not only slights the idea that religious people are capable of thought, but also tries to sort of railroad into this belief that you should condemn it without actually looking at all the statistics, the ideas, the history that we cited. %$* 279
and that sort of slighting of the religious belief makes me think that your argument might not be as sound as you think it is. %$* 279
a.c. grayling. %$* 13
can i come back to that? %$* 278
i hear a certain kind of incoherence on the other side there. %$* 278
firstly, if you're religious, you live longer, that puzzles me. %$* 278
i mean, isn't heaven meant to be a nice place? %$* 278
it's always been-- %$* 278
moses was like 800 years old or something like that. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 278
and then dinesh says that one reason why people stay religious into old age is because they're thinking about life after death. %$* 278
well, that was bernie madoff's mistake. %$* 278
he promised returns in this life. %$* 278
so you know, religion. %$* 278
i'm afraid the things that most people are brought up in a religious tradition, and those people who escape religion do it because they look at the facts, they look at the evidence, they look at the morality. %$* 278
they look at the teachings. %$* 278
they look at the world around them, and they recognize that there is something very divisive and very distorting here. %$* 278
look at small children even in kindergarten, all races and ethnicities and backgrounds and classes and religions. %$* 278
they don't know that. %$* 278
we have to work very, very hard to divide them and tell them what tribe they belong to and what religion they belong to. %$* 278
and that's where the source of the trouble comes in our world-- %$* 278
all right, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
from division. %$* 278
dinesh d'souza to respond. %$* 13
a.c.said earlier that the defining feature of religion is hierarchy and exclusivity. %$* 201
and i think that on both these, he's giving a very narrow and ethno-centric definition. %$* 201
first of all, christianity is the only religion in the world that considers another religion, judaism, to be wholly true. %$* 201
hinduism considers all other religions to be wholly true. %$* 201
there's no sense in the eastern religions of this hierarchy of this exclusivity. %$* 201
so we're seeing here not an attack on religion, but on a very slice of religion, perhaps fundamentalist religion. %$* 201
i think the deeper point here is this: and that is that the religious guy and the nonreligious guy are both responding to the world as it is. %$* 201
charles darwin became an atheist not because he discovered evolution. %$* 201
it wasn't facts. %$* 201
it was when his daughter, annie, died. %$* 201
and charles darwin said, "if there's a hell, lots of the lovely people i know would be in it. %$* 201
i can't bear that kind of a doctrine." you, matthew, in your article in slate magazine talked about nuns or teachers who beat you on the ankles and people-- %$* 201
people who stuck their hands down your pants. %$* 201
my point is, in many cases, we're not dealing with facts. %$* 201
we're dealing with wounded theism. %$* 201
many times when we heard the word "atheism," we're dealing with a person who is angry with god or angry maybe with the representative, the self-appointed representative of god. %$* 201
that's not real atheism. %$* 201
they too are conducting, if you will, an ideological war, otherwise they wouldn't-- %$* 201
all right. %$* 13
be here. %$* 201
that's an interesting point. %$* 13
matthew chapman, are you angry with god? %$* 13
how can you be angry with somebody that doesn't exist? %$* 280
i'm angry with dinesh because he's making these preposterous statements about my-- %$* 280
well, i didn't put my hand down your pants. %$* 201

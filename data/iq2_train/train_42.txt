and as people who have done this, they find they feel more energetic, which is why a lot of athletes are doing it. %$* 223
dental health acts exactly the same. %$* 223
in fact, even the study that he cited, when you looked over the longest period of time, the vegetarians kept their teeth more while the meat-eaters tended to lose them. %$* 223
this is not a reason to have a-- %$* 223
let's let chris respond. %$* 13
and, chris, we're not-- %$* 13
we're not going to make this a debate about your personal history, okay? %$* 13
and i don't at all think that that's the spirit in which neal responded, so he was-- %$* 13
he's making the point on the science, and i'd like you to respond on the science as well. %$* 13
sure. %$* 225
so i think – the science about whether those studies indicate a causal relationship between vegetarianism and mental disorders? %$* 225
no. %$* 13
or all of it? %$* 225
bottom line, you made an argument that you can get sick being a vegan. %$* 13
oh, sure. %$* 225
he's making an argument that there's a whole load of science and statistics that just say you're wrong. %$* 13
right. %$* 225
well, dr. %$* 225
barnard is entirely correct, first of all, that all of the studies that i cited about vegetarianism and mental disorders are observational studies, and they cannot show whether vegetarianism causes mental disorders, mental disorders cause vegetarianism, or there's some other type of-- %$* 225
or there's some other type of relationship. %$* 225
this is-- %$* 225
i mean, it's serious. %$* 225
any of those are possibilities, and they're not mutually exclusive. %$* 225
what we do know is that there is a wealth of information about biochemistry and the effects of the specific nutrient deficiencies that can be most common in vegetarian diets that are all related to mental health. %$* 225
and so biologically, it's very plausible. %$* 225
but i would like to also make the point that dr. %$* 225
barnard cannot have his low- fat, low-glycemic, vegan, chocolate cake and eat it to, because the studies that dr. %$* 225
barnard cited at the beginning about the relationship between eating meat and cancer and coronary heart disease are also observational studies, and they also tell us absolutely nothing about cause-and-effect relationships. %$* 225
and-- %$* 225
well, let me take issue with you there, if you don't mind. %$* 223
sure. %$* 225
neal barnard. %$* 13
i'm going to suggest that, joel, if i went to your farm, and i got one of your chickens who, as i'm sure you'll agree, they are not natural chickens. %$* 223
these are-- %$* 223
these are freaks of breeding over time. %$* 223
they are bred to become obese. %$* 223
and if i took one of them who maybe never had even any chemical given to that chicken, but if i kill them and cooked them, these same heterocyclic amines, these clear- cut carcinogens, would form on your chickens just like any other. %$* 223
so, regardless of whether it's organic or not, cooking skeletal muscle produces carcinogens. %$* 223
and that's why every epidemiologist agrees that vegetarians have less cancer. %$* 223
there's just no question about it. %$* 223
well-- %$* 226
anything, if you're trying to create cancer out of something-- %$* 226
an excess of anything can - - you can drink too much water and get sick. %$* 226
so, you know, in argentina, their per capita consumption of red meat is double what it is in the u.s. in argentina, the average person eats half a pound a day of red meat, and their cancer rate is half of the u.s. why? %$* 226
because it's grass-finished beef. %$* 226
and so there is a huge difference in the nutritional profile. %$* 226
i mean, you know, chris would probably be able to speak to this better, but there are-- %$* 226
you know, there are carcinogens in virtually all foods. %$* 226
and, you know, you can isolate those however you want to. %$* 226
and neal, or gene, the argument that your opponents are making as well, that meat is just really damn nutritious and nothing can match it, and if you want b12 in your diet, which is vital, you're not going to get it without eating meat, unless you take supplements. %$* 13
gene, do you want to take that? %$* 13
yeah, well, i-- %$* 224
gene baur. %$* 13
i’ve been a vegan since 1985, and i have not been very religious about taking b12 supplements. %$* 224
but i get everything i get from plant sources, so the b12 i get is from plant sources. %$* 224
b12 is the only nutrient that you need to think about, and that's made by microorganisms. %$* 224
so it's available in the environment. %$* 224
it's available in the soil. %$* 224
and otherwise you get everything-- %$* 224
so it's in soil? %$* 226
there's soil on vegetables, isn't there? %$* 224
yeah. %$* 226
the thing is, don't wash your kale. %$* 226
joel salatin, and then i'll come to you. %$* 13
joel salatin. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
so the point is, don't wash your kale. %$* 226
no. %$* 13
don't sanitize and don't zap it. %$* 224
neal barnard. %$* 13
vitamin b12 is not made by animals. %$* 223
it's not made by plants. %$* 223
it is made by bacteria. %$* 223
and historically, one theory is that the bacteria on plants, on the soil, on our fingers, in our mouths, give you that 2.4 micrograms, the tiny amount that you need. %$* 223
the other theory-- %$* 223
and people have shown that the bacteria in the human digestive tract actually produce absorbable b12, but in modern civilization, most of those bacteria are gone. %$* 223
they're too low. %$* 223
they produce the b12 so you can't absorb it. %$* 223
but in more primitive cultures, in cultures in developing countries, you do see production of b12 in humans just like in the other primates, and it's fully absorbable. %$* 223
the truth is, nobody really knows for sure. %$* 223
but what we do know is that most b12 people in hematology clinics are meat-eaters. %$* 223
and they are low on b12 because they are not absorbing it. %$* 223
it's hard to absorb b12 from meat. %$* 223
you need good stomach acid. %$* 223
you need intrinsic factor. %$* 223
and the u.s. government recommends that all meat-eaters over the age of 50 take b12 supplements because otherwise-- %$* 223
okay. %$* 13
they are deficient. %$* 223
chris masterjohn. %$* 13
yes. %$* 225
i would like to take this discussion back down to earth for a minute. %$* 225
so to put this in perspective-- %$* 225
what do you mean by that? %$* 13
why do you feel-- %$* 13
well, i mean, no, these are all great points, and it's a fascinating discussion to think about how we could get vitamin b12 from intestinal bacteria or from soil or from feces left on vegetables. %$* 225
but to-- %$* 225
no, that's not what i'm arguing. %$* 223
i think we want to-- %$* 225
i think we want to-- %$* 225
i'm not arguing that. %$* 223
i'm arguing, take a supplement because you don't want to be relying on it. %$* 223
right. %$* 225
okay. %$* 13
that’s good clarity. %$* 13
right. %$* 223
i mean, to put this back into context, we should just look at what are the studies on vitamin b12 deficiency levels in vegetarians, in vegans, and in elderly subjects who have poor digestion. %$* 225
and, so, one of the ways that we can get a bird’s-eye view of this literature is to look at what's called a meta-analysis, which is just a study that looks at all of the other relevant studies and pools the data together. %$* 225
and the most recent study-- %$* 225
the most recent pooled analysis of 18 studies using the highest quality markers of vitamin b12 deficiency found vitamin b12 deficiency in between 30 to 73 percent of vegetarians, between 43 to 90 percent of vegans, and the length of time on the vegetarian diet was also related to the deficiency. %$* 225
so, for example, one study found that 67 percent of lifelong vegetarian children and only-- %$* 225
or 25 percent of other vegetarian children-- %$* 225
were deficient. %$* 225
so it's a deficiency that can take years and years to develop. %$* 225
but studies also show that giving meat to those children doesn't solve the problem. %$* 223
what solves the-- %$* 223
is that-- %$* 13
is that true? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 223
you can take a b12 deficient person, give them meat, and they will still be b12 deficient. %$* 223
what everybody recommends, every doctor always recommends, don't rely on meat for b12.they always recommend a supplement because it's cheap, and it's safe. %$* 223
and that's true whether you're a vegan or a meat-eater. %$* 223
it's a complete red herring. %$* 223
everybody ought to be taking b12.it's been the u.s.government position for years. %$* 223
they say start at 50. i-- %$* 223
well, i certainly believe everything the u.s. government says. %$* 226
it’s joel salatin. %$* 13
you can take your chances. %$* 223
but the other thing to just mention, when you're talking about grass-fed beef, when my grandfather had his heart attack and died, it was grass- fed beef that my family raised, that we all ate because there weren't cafos back then. %$* 223
you know, you're trying to poke fun at this side for not being scientific or anecdotal. %$* 226
what's more anecdotal than when you're dad died? %$* 226
mine-- %$* 226
my mom's 90, independent, drives every day, dances every weekend. %$* 226
she's 90.she's eaten meat from day one, all of her life. %$* 226
the fact is we're different. %$* 226
we are different. %$* 223
we're different. %$* 226
most smokers don't get lung cancer. %$* 223
that's right, yeah. %$* 226
most smokers don't get lung cancer, but so many do. %$* 223
most meat-eaters are not going to get colorectal cancer, and they're not going to get stomach cancer, but so many do. %$* 223
but they're saying that you have a problem in establishing causality. %$* 13
yes. %$* 223
you do? %$* 13
oh, yeah, well-- %$* 223
yes. %$* 226
absolutely. %$* 226
it depends on what we're talking about. %$* 223
with something like cancer, you can't ethically do a randomized trial where you have half the people eat meat, and you track their cancer risk and have the other become vegan. %$* 223
there are ethical issues about doing that because it is so clear that meat is linked to cancer, you couldn't get-- %$* 223
you couldn't do such a study. %$* 223
you couldn't ask half a group to smoke cigarettes. %$* 223
we know cigarettes cause cancer. %$* 223
we know meat is going to increase cancer risk. %$* 223
there are two things that we could look at to improve our perspective on the meat and cancer relationship. %$* 225
one would be to try to control for all the differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians to better understand in those observational studies. %$* 225
the other point would be to go back to the evidence that i brought up in the beginning. %$* 225
and i'd like to start there just very briefly. %$* 225
weston price found, in numerous cases with good data from the same doctor reviewing-- %$* 225
who is weston price? %$* 13
weston price, i mentioned his research in the beginning-- %$* 225
oh. %$* 13
he was the first research director for the american dental association and a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. %$* 225
his approach was to try to look at populations that were actually free of disease. %$* 225
and so what he found was that in some cases-- %$* 225
his data on tooth decay were far better than his data on cancer. %$* 225
but he had some data on cancer, and there were cases of populations that did not have modernized diets but had meat in their diets that were free of cancer. %$* 225
what that means is that even the most vulnerable members of the population were protected. %$* 225
we don't know if they were protected by meat. %$* 225
but if you take a population of smokers, that's not what you find. %$* 225
there is no population of heavy smokers where all of them are free from cancers. %$* 225
so it’s a fundamentally different point. %$* 225
so, you're also saying, you also have the causality problem. %$* 13
yes. %$* 225
yeah, absolutely. %$* 225
so-- %$* 225
okay. %$* 13
so we really don't know whether-- %$* 13
no, i'm trying to establish what we know or not. %$* 13
we do know, and we had exactly the same issue with tobacco. %$* 223
there has never been a study where you bring in people and you give them tobacco to see if they get cancer. %$* 223
once you have such consistent evidence, you have to make this decision. %$* 223
and back in 2007, the american institute for cancer research said, look at hotdogs, bologna, all the processed meats, and colorectal cancer. %$* 223
and they concluded the evidence was so convincing, they said, the amount you should feed a child, the amount you should eat yourself, was zero. %$* 223
you should just not have it. %$* 223
and the evidence has only gotten more convincing since that time. %$* 223
what hasn't changed is the fact that these things are marketed, and they're pushed, and they sound folksy. %$* 223
and isn't it nice to go to a ballgame and have a hotdog with your kid? %$* 223
but i think in the same way as my dad gave us cigarettes once in a while and now we're embarrassed about that, i think our generation is now going to say, "holy cow." %$* 223
all right. %$* 13
"we know food is an issue. %$* 18
we've got to make-- %$* 18
joel salatin. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 226
but the problem is that all of your meat studies are based on toxin-laden meat that's been raised in a factory-farming situation. %$* 226
if you take that out of it, the nutrition and the analysis is completely different. %$* 226
and not only that, but i'd like to ask a question-- %$* 226
you're talking about cooking, cooking, cooking, does that mean-- %$* 226
i'd like to get back to the topic actually-- %$* 226
that if we don't cook it and eat raw meat, then we're okay and it's okay to eat meat with a face if we don't cook it? %$* 226
the point that i made is that when you analyze meat, some of the carcinogens are produced by cooking. %$* 223
the hdas and the phs are just from heating it up-- %$* 223
yeah, same thing happens with vegetables. %$* 226
and good heavens, no-- %$* 223
i want to bring-- %$* 13
gene baur has been the polite guy in this debate so far. %$* 13
i just wanted-- %$* 224
and you get points for that, but come on-- %$* 13
well, in terms of the science, there's the china study which the new york times called the "grand prix of epidemiology," done by t.colin campbell, a biochemist at cornell university. %$* 224
and what he found was that the more animal foods people ate, the more problems they had; the more plants foods people ate, the healthier they were. %$* 224
and these were animal foods that were not necessarily produced in factory farms, so just the animal foods were correlated with human health problems, including cancers. %$* 224
and so that was not factory-farmed meat. %$* 224
it was range-fed meat or grazing animals, and they were still problems. %$* 224
all right. %$* 13
i want to move-- %$* 13
i think we have an impasse on this point. %$* 13
and i acknowledge that both of you have said causality is difficult to prove, but you're talking about trends, and we respect that, but-- %$* 13
the china study has been debunked by so many experts it’s-- %$* 226
it shouldn’t even be brought up in this debate. %$* 226
that’s how bad it is. %$* 226
i don’t want to parse it tediously, but i just would like to say one sentence-- %$* 225
don’t be tedious. %$* 13
just the one-sentence point. %$* 225
if you go to the original data, there is no correlation between meat intake and cancer. %$* 225
if you read t. colin campbell’s book, what he does it make a rather convoluted argument that some things are associated with meat, those things are associated with cancer, and so on, but the actual data doesn’t show a direct correlation like that. %$* 225
let’s go to this question-- %$* 13
the ethics and the values part of this discussion. %$* 13
and by the way, you as audience members can circle back on some of this when we go to you for questions, but i want to go to gene bauer, because where you really stood out in your opening statement was making this-- %$* 13
really, really making this-- %$* 13
strong statement in support of-- %$* 13
i don’t know if the term is oxymoronic, but-- %$* 13
a humanity towards animals. %$* 13
and you have rescued farm animals and arranged for them to have a good, long life, not ending up on somebody’s plate. %$* 13
and one of your opponents, joel salatin, who raises animals in an organic system, basically made the argument that eating and being eaten is part of life, and that the kind of argument that you’re making about wanting to take supplements and eat only vegetables is a privilege of the 21st century and the united states, and that this is new, and that history, evolution, reality, and most of the rest of the world is: you’ve got to eat meat, and there’s nothing wrong with that. %$* 13
take that on. %$* 13
well, i think over the course of our history, we’ve done what we’ve had to do to survive, and often that has been eating meat, but it’s also sometimes been eating other people. %$* 224
and we’ve also done a lot of things over the course of our history that have not been very good, you know? %$* 224
you know, you think of institutions like slavery. %$* 224
and as time goes, we come to look at these things more critically and we start making decisions and choices that are, i think, more humane. %$* 224
and when it comes to animals, they have feelings like we do. %$* 224
they’re not that much different than we are, and there’s been attempts to rationalize and say, well, they are different. %$* 224
they don’t use tools, for example. %$* 224
then jane goodall found that animals were using tools, and we had to change our thinking and say, well, they don’t use language; but now we see that these other animals use language. %$* 224
you know, turkeys and chickens have many different calls for different things, and as we learn, you know, i think our responsibility grows. %$* 224
and the fact is, we can choose not to eat other animals. %$* 224
in the case of a lion, they don’t have a choice. %$* 224
in the case of us, we do have a choice. %$* 224
gene, where do you go on the evolutionary scale, and putting ourselves fairly high up and putting insects fairly low down? %$* 13
i mean, would you swat a mosquito? %$* 13
would you kill a snake? %$* 13
would you trap a rat? %$* 13
to me, it’s about not causing unnecessary suffering. %$* 224
so if i don’t need to cause harm to somebody else, i’m going to try not to do that. %$* 224
and, you know, there’s a difference between dying and being murdered. %$* 224
you know? %$* 224
and even people like e.b.white wrote about this, you know, who wrote charlotte’s web. %$* 224
he said a farm is a peculiar problem for a man who likes animals, because the fate of most livestock is that they are murdered by their benefactors. %$* 224
the creatures may live serenely, but they end violently and the odor of doom hangs about them always. %$* 224
so there’s-- %$* 224
it’s about our relationship with other animals. %$* 224
is it about compassion and kindness or is it about cruelty-- %$* 224
okay. %$* 13
and exploitation and killing? %$* 224
let’s go to the farmer on the other side, who’s arguing against the motion, joel salatin. %$* 13
yeah, well, you know, i don’t have any problem with vegans. %$* 226
i really don’t. %$* 226
they become our best customers when they find out they can get healthy with our meat, but-- %$* 226
where i really get my dander up is when i’m accused of saying you can’t love because you dress the animals. %$* 226
that’s a powerful statement-- %$* 226
did you say “dress animals”? %$* 13
“dress” is a euphemism for slaughter. %$* 226
it just sounds nicer on the radio. %$* 226
it sure did. %$* 13
i was picturing a tutu and a little hat. %$* 13
i’m glad i caught that one. %$* 13
it means like you dress them for the table, you know? %$* 226
nobody wants a live chicken on their dining room table, you know? %$* 226
you want it dressed. %$* 226
you want it, you know-- %$* 226
okay. %$* 13
at our thanksgiving we have live turkeys, actually. %$* 224
we feed them, we don’t eat them so %$* 224
no, but let’s-- %$* 13
joel salatin, the floor is yours. %$* 13
yeah, so the problem becomes-- %$* 226
you know, it’s nice to sit here and say we’re going to rescue all these animals. %$* 226
the problem is that it just doesn’t work. %$* 226
how are you going to fertilize the vegetables that you’re eating? %$* 226
well, there’s actually veganic farms, including one right across the street from us that grows produce without any animal inputs, and there’s another veganic farmer i know of in the uk that’s been in business for 37 years, and there’s several of them-- %$* 224
they’re starting to now develop around the country. %$* 224
so this type of agriculture is possible, and it is a growing area. %$* 224
it's possible on soils that have been built by manure. %$* 226
no, not necessarily. %$* 224
oh, yes. %$* 226
no, green manure. %$* 224
you know, you can grow hay and things like that. %$* 224
cover crops can be used. %$* 224
and there have been people doing this for decades. %$* 224
okay, so how much acreage-- %$* 226
how much extra acreage-- %$* 226
is it going to take to farm that way? %$* 226
well, you need to do rotation. %$* 224
it's going to take about three or four times, maybe five times, the amount of acres we're currently using. %$* 226
well, if we're not having to grow a lot of crops to feed a lot of livestock, we'll have enough land for that. %$* 224
we don't-- %$* 226
well, i don't think his point is whether there was land-- %$* 13
i already said we don't have to grow the crops to feed the livestock because there's that much scavenging and that sort of thing going on. %$* 226
the problem is that we're not using animals in their historically normal role, which is as scavengers, whether it's pigs scavenging acorns in the woods, chickens eating, you know, vegetable scraps. %$* 226
if every household had a couple of chickens to eat their vegetable scraps, there wouldn't even be a factory farm chicken industry, and you wouldn't even have to put the garbage on a garbage truck to send it to a composting facility to go onto your, you know, ornamental flowerbeds. %$* 226
well, i'm not against, you know, somebody having chickens that they feed the scraps. %$* 224
but then where i have the issue though is when somebody goes up and then cuts off their head. %$* 224
you know, that's where the problem is. %$* 224
and, you know, in one of your books, you even mentioned how, you know, “i believe it is psychologically inappropriate to slaughter animals every single day.” %$* 224
that's exactly right. %$* 226
so i mean, it's a harsh interaction. %$* 224
it's a violent, bloody interaction. %$* 224
it is. %$* 226
and it’s not necessary. %$* 224
well, the necessary part is fascinating since there is no animal-less place. %$* 226
so where are we going to put all these animals? %$* 226
you know, if we're going-- %$* 226
are we going to sterilize all of them? %$* 226
are we going to make natural parks? %$* 226
the reason is we're mass producing them. %$* 224
we’re mass producing-- %$* 224
turkeys today can't even reproduce naturally. %$* 224
they're all artificially inseminated. %$* 224
wait, wait. %$* 13
for clarity, let's keep it on the terms in which-- %$* 13
in which joel farms, because the retreat to the farm factory scenario is not one that he's defending. %$* 13
well, i'm not so sure because i’m guessing that you get little chicks that have been genetically bred to get obese, and they live about eight weeks, and then you slaughter them. %$* 223
and i'm guessing they are not grazing freely in the pasture. %$* 223
i'm guessing they're in a tiny little pen, and they grow up to be obese, and then-- %$* 223
and you are-- %$* 223
these are among the animals that add up to about a million animals per hour, bred and killed, bred and killed, bred and killed. %$* 223
and if people were not eating animals with a face, or even years ago, people didn't eat animals anywhere-- %$* 223
anywhere-- %$* 223
like that. %$* 223
i've been doing-- %$* 223
the topic-- %$* 226
the topic-- %$* 226
just one-- %$* 13
i'm not going to let you weeble on that, because the topic is, "don’t eat anything with a face." one of the things that chris and i are committed to is holding you guys to say, “no exceptions,” because that's the topic. %$* 226
it's not about eating less meat. %$* 226
i would even advocate eating less meat. %$* 226
in fact, i think meat should be about three times more expensive than it is-- %$* 226
yeah, agreed. %$* 224
i think that would be a good thing. %$* 226
and that would actually rectify a lot of the issues that i'm sure all four of us agree on. %$* 226
well, i think we have to go one step further-- %$* 223
but the topic-- %$* 226
the topic is that it is morally reprehensible, and you cannot be compassionate if you're eating meat. %$* 226
that's the motion. %$* 226
and it's one. %$* 226
it's not a few less. %$* 226
it's one. %$* 226
now, we're talking about whether-- %$* 223
i want to go to the audience for questions. %$* 13
i'm going to let this comment be made by gene, but after that-- %$* 13
can you hold onto your question for a bit? %$* 13
sure. %$* 225
and i'll come to you. %$* 13
just remember to raise your hand. %$* 13
let me call on you. %$* 13
if you're upstairs, you need to come downstairs and really make it tight and a focused question. %$* 13
go ahead, gene. %$* 13
you know, the motion is, do we eat anything with a face? %$* 224
and we say, we should vote for the motion that we do not eat anything with a face. %$* 224
so it's great that we all agree that we should eat less animals, and factory farming is bad, but again, it comes down to each individual animal who is killed and eaten. %$* 224
i agree with the point that life often comes from death. %$* 224
you know, animals die, plants die, they go back into the soil. %$* 224
but dying is one thing. %$* 224
killing is an entirely different thing. %$* 224
what about-- %$* 13
your opponents argue that vegetables also have sentient existences, that they communicate. %$* 13
well, i mean, i don't know the science about that. %$* 224
i kind of doubt it. %$* 224
but even if that were the case, even if that were the case, eating plants directly, you're causing much less death, because-- %$* 224
that's false, however, because when you-- %$* 225
chris masterjohn. %$* 13
monocrop soybeans and corn, you kill countless animals-- %$* 225
snakes, rodents, insects and so on-- %$* 225
through tillage. %$* 225
so you kill a lot more animals when you eat veggie burgers than you do when you eat beef, because-- %$* 225
no, no, because you're feeding the soybeans then to the cows. %$* 223
i'm sorry. %$* 225
say that again? %$* 225
you're feeding the soybeans to the cows. %$* 223
no, no, no-- %$* 225
we've already agreed soybeans don't need to be fed to cows. %$* 226
we don't need to grow a single soybean. %$* 226
no, no, no. %$* 225
excuse me, when you eat the soybeans-- %$* 225
it is question time. %$* 13
when you eat the soybeans yourself-- %$* 225
you need to kill animals to grow them. %$* 18
that's the point. %$* 18
a mic will come in from this side. %$* 13
thank you very much for the lively debate, and thank you for taking my question. %$* 19
my name is kendra. %$* 19
i have a question for dr. %$* 19
barnard. %$* 19
you mentioned, in your opening statement, about some of the health benefits of a plant-based diet, and one of them was weight reduction. %$* 19
i'm wondering what the prevalence of the high-protein, low-carb diets and the atkins diet, can you speak a little bit about, you know, what your thoughts are on such a diet and the long-term effects and-- %$* 19
i'd like to-- %$* 13
i'd like to see if you could focus this, so that they're actually debating on the point of the motion. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
is a high-protein, low-carb diet a healthy diet, sustainable diet? %$* 19
is that-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 223
the short answer is no. %$* 223
people-- %$* 223
but you're raising an important paradox, is that in some of these fad diets, people would eat what seemed like a lot of meat, but they were still losing weight because they were avoiding all carbohydrate. %$* 223
but in more careful study, it all came down to calories. %$* 223
if people eating that way did not reduce their overall calorie intake, they didn't lose an ounce. %$* 223
and that's why a lot of people on atkins and other diets like that, they just don't lose weight. %$* 223
and that's why almost all of them end up regaining and going beyond later, plus their cholesterol levels go through the roof, and they have-- %$* 223
over the long run, these people do miserably. %$* 223
sir? %$* 225
you can take cracks at these questions each time if it goes to one side. %$* 13
if you want to, you can take the other side. %$* 13
i would like to take a crack at that. %$* 225
sure. %$* 13
chris masterjohn. %$* 13
so i've read a lot of dr. %$* 225
barnard's studies, and i'm very impressed by the way that they're designed and the way that they're reported. %$* 225
but if you look at the data, what i think dr. %$* 225
barnard has clearly shown is that the metabolic effects and the improvements in almost every health measure are due to weight loss. %$* 225
and what dr. %$* 225
barnard has created is a run-of-the-mill, weight-loss diet with mediocre efficacy, where there's lots of positive effects due mostly to the weight loss that occurs in the first three to six months and then starts creeping back up. %$* 225
and if you – %$* 225
no-- %$* 223
wait a second. %$* 225
just let me-- %$* 225
please let me the point, and then you can respond-- %$* 225
you know, chris, i want to stop you. %$* 13
i want to stop you on this, %$* 13
sure. %$* 225
because it's turning into a personal attack. %$* 13
and then he's going to have to spend 15 minutes defending everything that you say. %$* 13
i can do it much quicker. %$* 223
and-- %$* 13
and so i would prefer that we move on and go to a question up here. %$* 13
sir in blue. %$* 13
we just discourage, you know, going after people in terms like that. %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
my name is alex. %$* 18
this is for dr. %$* 18
barnard too. %$* 18
the motion is, “don’t eat anything with a face.” and one thing which may have slipped through the cracks is fish, which has a face as well, and we haven't really-- %$* 18
i got an email from a friend saying, could you please change the motion to, "don't eat anything with an ass." %$* 13
that may work as well. %$* 18
because he wants to eat fish. %$* 13
but go ahead. %$* 13
fish has kind of slipped through the cracks in this debate, and it hasn't really been discussed, and i wonder what your thoughts are about fish, and can you eat a mainly vegetarian-- %$* 18
gene baur, can you-- %$* 13
or a pescatarian diet. %$* 18
let's-- %$* 13
we haven't heard from gene. %$* 13
let's let him take that, and then the other side respond. %$* 13
again, the more that we look at these animals, the more we learn that they have sentience, that fish have feelings, they have memory, they learn from each other. %$* 224
and, again, we don't need to kill them and eat them. %$* 224
so from an ethical standpoint, i say we don't need to. %$* 224
and again, i've been a vegan since 1985, gotten everything i've needed from plants. %$* 224
joel salatin, you're talking about populations that live near the water, that's where they go. %$* 13
well, absolutely. %$* 226
and, you know, i find it fascinating that all of the attributes given to animals plants have too. %$* 226
the dna structure of grasses, for example, when you introduce a species, it nativizes its dna structure to become more climatically nativized to a certain place. %$* 226
that's memory. %$* 226
that's genetic memory and adaptation to a certain place. %$* 226
if that isn't responding to things, i don't know what is. %$* 226
and i just absolutely don't appreciate this false dichotomy that when i take the life of a carrot the carrot doesn't scream. %$* 226
and in answer to the fish question: you're good with the fish eating? %$* 13
i'm absolutely good with the fish. %$* 226
i like fish. %$* 226
down front here. %$* 13
but-- %$* 226
but i will say this: i only eat fish when i'm on the coast. %$* 226
i don't eat fish in oklahoma city. %$* 226
that's part of the local-- %$* 226
the integrity, the nesting in the womb, that creates that-- %$* 226
that food integrity. %$* 226
so i love to eat clam chowder when i go to new england, but i don't want to get clam chowder in st. %$* 226
louis. %$* 226
we skipped over the health issues. %$* 18
let me just-- %$* 18
30 seconds on this. %$* 18
can you make 15? %$* 13
15. %$* 223
go. %$* 13
when we look at fish eaters and compare them to meat-eaters, they are marginally slimmer than people who eat heavy amounts of meat, but they are nowhere near as slim as the vegetarians. %$* 223
the fish eaters as a group have more diabetes. %$* 223
carcinogens form in cooked salmon just like in cooked chicken. %$* 223
and there's nothing like getting the skeletal muscle out of your diet. %$* 223
and fish also have a central system and brains. %$* 225
down front here. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is angela. %$* 19
i'm just wondering, for this side on the affirmative, and not trying to be funny at all, we focused on killing and cooking, so if we have left a chicken to lead a long, lovely life and let it die a natural death, is it okay to eat it raw? %$* 19
you know-- %$* 224
that's a great question. %$* 13

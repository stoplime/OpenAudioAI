really the issue is how long does it take to develop the drugs. %$* 295
on average, it takes about nine years to develop a drug for endocrine disorders, about six years to develop a drug for cancer. %$* 295
it has to go through typically three phases of clinical trials. %$* 295
the first phase is looking for proof of activity; second phase is looking for - - %$* 295
and what you do is you go, and you get a group of patients, maybe 25 patients? %$* 13
depending on the disease, you're either doing it in healthy volunteers or in sick patients in you have a drug targeted to a-- %$* 295
you know, a rare cancer or something that's fatal. %$* 295
you're going to put the drug in phase i in patients who are already sick. %$* 295
but typically if it's a drug targeted at, let's say, hypertension, you're going to put it in healthy volunteers. %$* 295
and in phase i, you're looking mostly at safety, although they're starting to look at issues of efficacy, and you're starting to look at issues of dose. %$* 295
phase ii, you're looking at? %$* 13
phase ii, you're looking at proof of concept. %$* 295
you want to see if the drug works. %$* 295
you're not necessarily assessing the clinical outcomes in the clinical trial, but you're looking at indication that's the drug is having the activity that you anticipated. %$* 295
and that's more people. %$* 13
and that's more people. %$* 295
and depending on the disease you're looking at, it's anywhere from-- %$* 295
it could be a couple of hundred in a cancer trial to, you know, 5,000 in a primary care drug. %$* 295
phase iii? %$* 13
phase iii is the pivotal trial. %$* 295
it's the registration trial. %$* 295
depending on the disease you're looking at, it could be a couple of thousand patients in a cancer trial at a cost of about $100,000 per patient enrolled in the trial. %$* 295
and in some cardiovascular trials, you're looking at trials that enroll 40- or 50,000 patients. %$* 295
and there, you're looking for statistically rigorous evidence that the drug has a clinical effect on the desired outcome. %$* 295
okay. %$* 13
does this side agree that that's essentially the structure of the classic trial since 1962? %$* 13
yes, with the proviso that dr. %$* 296
gottlieb said, something very important, which is how much time does the company take to develop a drug as opposed to the matter at hand - - %$* 296
okay. %$* 13
which is how long does fda take to review it, which is really what we're concerned with. %$* 296
but you can't-- %$* 295
whoa, whoa, whoa. %$* 13
just-- %$* 13
i'm going to let this unleash in just a second. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
so i just-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i personally felt i needed to hear that to understand what the heck it is we're talking about. %$* 13
well, you don't yet. %$* 18
so thank you for that. %$* 13
and i'm glad that you mostly agree with it. %$* 13
but before we debate the specifics, because i think debating the specifics is what we're going to be doing, i just want to take the large question to this side, that this side put to you, which is that that system that they described, they are arguing-- %$* 13
i'm going to call it the slow track. %$* 13
you can object to that language. %$* 13
i just want to distinguish it from the fast track. %$* 13
they're saying the fact that the fast track had to be developed-- %$* 13
and i think this does date to the-- %$* 13
to the midst of the aids crisis and was accepted, and it worked, and drugs got out there, and they saved lives, establishes that that regime, that one, two, three trial thing since 1962, is a problem. %$* 13
it's slow. %$* 13
it's not saving lives. %$* 13
and i want to-- %$* 13
i want to take that point that the existence of a fast track actually wins the debate for them. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
i think it was helpful that mr. %$* 296
huber gave us his views about the fda approval process in that regard. %$* 296
i think it was less helpful when he gave the audience my views about that because he got it wrong. %$* 296
in my book, i indicated that, yes, the fast track did come from aids activists scaring the hell out of the fda because they were so horribly slow. %$* 296
and that was a good thing. %$* 296
and that happened in the late '80s and early '90s, and fda got better because of that excellent pressure from the aids community. %$* 296
and in the presidential panel's report that you mentioned that advocates that fda needs to figure out more creative ways to move forward in that direction, that's also something i approve of because i was on the panel that helped write that report. %$* 296
so indeed, this is something good, and we’ve got to not fight the last war and say it was terrible in 1989.and now we have a fast track and keep complaining about how things were in 1989.the fact that there's a fast track makes sense, because some drugs are really breakthroughs. %$* 296
and you want to use the limited resources that fda has to move things forward. %$* 296
fast-tracking the entire array of drugs make-- %$* 13
be an incautious-- %$* 13
no. %$* 296
thing to do? %$* 13
it would be an unwise use of limited resources, because we don't need to fast-track the next statin of which we already have plenty. %$* 296
i-- %$* 101
forgive me, but-- %$* 101
peter huber. %$* 13
this just isn't an accurate description. %$* 101
and first of all, fast-track is a quite different term used by fda.it is not the accelerated approval. %$* 101
you know, call it whatever you like, but they are different things. %$* 101
okay-- %$* 13
on the accelerated-- %$* 101
look, but this is absolutely unequivocal. %$* 101
under the accelerated approval rule, you cut off a big chunk of what the fda's normal rules do. %$* 101
you actually cut off in the middle of phase iii or phase ii. or-- %$* 101
and some people are pushing to cut off after phase i, because the results are so dramatic there, okay? %$* 101
you are actually not doing what is normally required %$* 101
and peter's-- %$* 296
as-- %$* 101
wait just as second. %$* 101
and who does it, then? %$* 101
because you still have to finish. %$* 101
and the answer is, you do it-- %$* 101
by and large, you do it in phase iv.and a lot of doctors out there are now also using the drug. %$* 101
and they are working completely independently and they are the ones who are using the modern tools to work out how to fit these rather simple drugs to our extremely complex bodies. %$* 101
they're finding the biomarkers on efficacy and safety. %$* 101
these are all emerging later. %$* 101
they are getting the precision medicine. %$* 101
and nowhere else in the fda protocols you get that. %$* 101
it never emerges during the standardized conventional protocols. %$* 101
you are blinded all the way through. %$* 101
there is no bayesian adaption during the trials. %$* 101
there's-- %$* 101
there's what? %$* 13
just wait-- %$* 13
i don't know-- %$* 13
i don't know-- %$* 13
you just don't get the information, okay? %$* 101
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
i'm not saying it to mock you at all. %$* 13
i'm saying it because i don't understand in using terms of art, which, if you took a minute to explain actually would help us all. %$* 13
i put in one word, bayesian. %$* 101
that means that you're actually-- %$* 101
right. %$* 13
that you're-- %$* 101
i was lost. %$* 13
it means you're actually looking at the data as you go and learning from it as you go and adapting to it. %$* 101
and the fda-- %$* 101
okay. %$* 13
is so concerned about something called selection bias, they don't allow it all. %$* 101
okay. %$* 13
i would just add to that the fda has actually been backing away from the accelerated approval rule in recent years, so much that the congress had to re-codify it and reach a legislation to say, “we really meant it. %$* 101
we want you to use this try to”-- %$* 101
okay, so just so-- %$* 13
to understand, because i'm getting the gist of it. %$* 13
you think that's a good thing. %$* 13
this is a good development. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
because i want to-- %$* 13
it-- %$* 101
these guys-- %$* 13
what do you think about it? %$* 13
it is. %$* 101
the only place we are actually developing modern drugs-- %$* 101
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
are-- %$* 101
start at the molecular level. %$* 101
what about-- %$* 13
nowhere else fda. %$* 101
what about their argument for accelerated approval? %$* 13
well, i have trouble with that. %$* 297
unless it's linked on the other end with post-market surveillance. %$* 297
i mean, if you're going to short circuit the safety of the public on the front end of these approval processes, whether for devices or for drugs, then you've got to make sure that you have a credible early warning system on-- %$* 297
you know, to prevent the russians from coming in over the-- %$* 297
from the arctic circle. %$* 297
but an early warning system that will allow the immediate understanding of the various communities involved here to feed back, to get that drug or get that device-- %$* 297
why do you call it-- %$* 13
off the market. %$* 297
why do you call it “short circuit the safety of the american public”? %$* 13
it's very pejorative. %$* 13
that is-- %$* 297
well, if you're going to short circuit on the front end, sure-- %$* 297
but why short-- %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
i think their term would be make it more efficient, save time, save lives. %$* 13
you say “short circuit safety.” %$* 13
i think-- %$* 297
why do you think it's-- %$* 13
you're saying it's dangerous. %$* 13
why? %$* 13
i think it's dangerous because unless you can have early detection of problems on the-- %$* 297
on the post-market side, you are endangering the public. %$* 297
look-- %$* 101
and i couldn't agree more, but let me tell you something. %$* 101
the whole notion that you convene a group of patients of a certain size, and you test them for a certain time, and then you make a declaration of a drug is a pure artifice of the kinds of the statistics that the fda uses in its conventional protocols. %$* 101
it's the frequentest trial. %$* 101
if you-- %$* 101
forgive the jargon-- %$* 101
the alternative i've been discussing is typically called bayesian trials. %$* 101
and those are completely open-ended. %$* 101
no serious bayesian says we will stop after certain time and a certain number of patients. %$* 101
you keep feeding the data into the system forever and you keep refining forever. %$* 101
and you put it in massive computer-- %$* 101
the databases, which people are already doing. %$* 101
and that's the process. %$* 101
and you can have separate calls on when people convene and charging-- %$* 101
they're using the drugs, but that's how you do the side. %$* 101
well, let me go to jerry avorn. %$* 13
jerry avorn, are you a bayesian-- %$* 13
it is my-- %$* 296
or anti-bayesian? %$* 13
actually, i think there's a lot to be said for bayesian analyses. %$* 296
and i know that fda is interested in learning more about it. %$* 296
but that's a little arcane-- %$* 296
yeah, let’s not do that. %$* 13
maybe to give a concrete example of how-- %$* 296
i mean, who could be against rapid assessment of drugs? %$* 296
and i can give you an example of why we can sometimes think that that's not a great idea. %$* 296
there was a drug approved at the very-- %$* 296
in the last couple of days of 2012 for tuberculosis. %$* 296
and the fda approved it based on an accelerated review in which it looked at what we called a surrogate marker. %$* 296
that is, not “did it make your tuberculosis better” but “did it change some lab tests? %$* 296
” in this case, it was about how much tb bug was growing into your sputum. %$* 296
and that seems like a good idea, because the law requires that fdas then have to follow that up with a real clinical trial, where you actually follow patients and ask did their tb get better, besides did their sputum get better. %$* 296
the problem that-- %$* 296
i have a longer article about it in the journal of the american medical association a couple weeks ago. %$* 296
the problem is that the fda sped through that, approved the drug because it made the sputum get more sterile of tb drugs a couple of weeks sooner than placebo did. %$* 296
the only problem was that there was a five- time greater rate of death rate in the people given this new drug than the people given placebo. %$* 296
and most of those deaths were from tuberculosis. %$* 296
what about the follow-up studies that the law requires the fda to do? %$* 296
they told the company, “we want you to come back with a real clinical trial about this drug. %$* 296
and we want it on our desk by 2022.” i think that suggests-- %$* 296
all right. %$* 13
that the fda can sometimes go too far in that direction. %$* 296
that's only the scenario-- %$* 13
a scenario laid out that was very compelling. %$* 13
it's very concerning. %$* 13
can you respond to that? %$* 13
there is no question that fda should have authority after these drugs are approved through trials that try to accelerate the development to continue the studies and then collect information. %$* 295
but when we're dealing with unmet medical needs, life-threatening disorders, patient want access to these drugs sooner. %$* 295
and you talked just about review times. %$* 295
but the real issue here is development times. %$* 295
and they've been going up. %$* 295
and they've been going up because the trials that fda's mandating on drug developers are more and more rigorous. %$* 295
they're larger and larger trials. %$* 295
you're talking about trials that used to be two or 3,000 patients-- %$* 295
now are 10- or 20,000 patients. %$* 295
why is that? %$* 13
because the fda is wedded to an old model of statistics. %$* 295
i know we don't want to talk about it-- %$* 295
no, it's okay to talk about statistics. %$* 13
but why are they seeking more statistics today than they did 10 years ago? %$* 13
more certainty. %$* 295
the more patients you can enroll in a clinical trial, the better the-- %$* 295
but why weren't they-- %$* 13
potential or value. %$* 295
why weren't they interested in more certainty 50 years ago? %$* 13
i-- %$* 101
well, let me just-- %$* 13
i just want-- %$* 13
because i get quite a run, peter. %$* 13
i want to let your-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 101
speak. %$* 13
because they were willing to embrace uncertainty years ago-- %$* 295
why? %$* 13
when it came these drugs. %$* 295
it was a different culture. %$* 295
there was a sense that there weren't a lot of drugs for a lot of these diseases. %$* 295
and now, they have the sense that there is sort of abundance of riches, which there really isn't, when it comes to unmet medical needs. %$* 295
the problem is that the mindset that guides the development of new drug for hypertension, which we might all agree should be fairly rigorous, because we have good drugs for those diseases, infects every other corner of the fda. they don't make distinctions between drugs for very rare, very-- %$* 295
right. %$* 13
difficult disorders. %$* 295
not enough. %$* 295
they do it in the oncology division, to a point. %$* 295
is this a cover your backside thing? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 295
all right. %$* 13
is the fda covering its backside? %$* 13
david challoner? %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
no-- %$* 13
if that-- %$* 13
but that is what-- %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
to make this question actually more serious and legitimate to what scott was saying-- %$* 13
he's basically saying that the need for caution has just gotten out of control. %$* 13
that because more tests can be done, more tests are being-- %$* 13
more patients can be tested, more patients are being enrolled. %$* 13
and that the tolerance of being a little bit uncertain was greater in the past than it is now. %$* 13
and that that's a problem. %$* 13
i have trouble with that. %$* 297
you know, i-- %$* 297
you know, the fda is a public health agency. %$* 297
and the public health is a broadly considered status of the general health of the public, some of which are at risk, many of which are not, and are treated with either drugs or devices. %$* 297
and i think that the fda is required to look to the public health, broadly, in all of its decision-making. %$* 297
now, has it become bureaucratic? %$* 297
has there been slowdowns? %$* 297
i mean, i think my partner jerry mentioned that 50 percent of the salaries of the staff at the fda who are looking at, quote, “our public health,” yours and mine, are now salaried by the industries that they're regulating. %$* 297
now, somehow that doesn't smell right to me. %$* 297
i think there's a built-in conflict there-- %$* 297
structural conflict that the congress has allowed, that we need to look at. %$* 297
but-- %$* 297
we should-- %$* 295
i mean, we should talk a little about medical devices as well here. %$* 295
a lot of the problems that you talked about medical devices are engineering problems. %$* 295
but your solution is more credible data. %$* 295
and you're not going to be able to solve engineering problems with clinical data. %$* 295
you're going to need better engineering, folks at fda-- %$* 295
can you-- %$* 13
to look at these problems. %$* 295
give a concrete example? %$* 13
something like a-- %$* 295
the lead for an implantable defibrillator snapping off. %$* 295
that's an engineering problem and you need to understand the biomechanics of that lead and when it's going to-- %$* 295
in other words, you need to see if the device works-- %$* 13
exactly. %$* 295
and literally, a company will sit with a tester and go like this with it 10,000 million times to see what it looks like. %$* 295
and are you saying the fda would not test it that way? %$* 13
fda would test it that way, but the solution that you're proposing and the solution you proposed with the iom panel was more clinical data for those devices. %$* 295
and i'm saying you're not going to ferret out those kinds of challenges. %$* 295
i mean, some of the challenges you're talking, maybe you would. %$* 295
but many of them, you wouldn't. %$* 295
i'll give you another anecdote. %$* 295
the minimally invasive aortic valve, right now, before a year ago, to have your aortic valve repaired when it became brittle, you had to have open heart surgery. %$* 295
if you went to europe, you could get a catheter to insert a new valve through a minimally invasive procedure, much like a cardiac catheterization. %$* 295
30,000 europeans had that valve implanted in them before it was approved here in the united states. %$* 295
it took us four years since it was approved in europe to finally approve it here. %$* 295
and fda was requiring companies to put it in pigs and sheep when there were thousands of europeans walking around with it in their chest. %$* 295
now, you explain to me why we couldn't learn more from those europeans and the clinical data that was generated there than we're going to learn from pigs and sheep. %$* 295
and another answer-- %$* 295
wait, wait. %$* 13
it's a great question. %$* 13
it's a great question. %$* 13
so less is more. %$* 13
stop when you're ahead because i want to hear from the other-- %$* 13
i want to hear from the other side. %$* 13
it's a great question. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 296
jerry avorn. %$* 13
sometimes the europeans get it right, and we get it wrong. %$* 296
sometimes we get it right, and the europeans get it wrong. %$* 296
there are examples in both directions. %$* 296
it is not the case, as the other side would have you believe, that the europeans or the canadians or the japanese are always getting access to these wonderful new drugs years before americans. %$* 296
we also have drugs that are approved here before they are approved in europe and devices. %$* 296
but on devices, they are. %$* 295
i mean, devices are different. %$* 295
they are getting access to devices before the united states. %$* 295
and medical device companies in the u.s. are moving to europe right now because they can get approved there much faster than they can here. %$* 295
let me-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
i want to move in two different directions. %$* 13
i'll tell you what they are now, and we'll work through them. %$* 13
one is to the side that's arguing against the motion that the fda is overall cautious, your opponents have talked about the fact that people will die waiting for drugs because of this process. %$* 13
and i want to put that to you. %$* 13
and then to the other side, they've gone through a list of horror stories that are real. %$* 13
and i want to-- %$* 13
i want to hear your response to that. %$* 13
first, to the side that's arguing against the motion that the fda is overall cautious, they - - they've laid out a pretty good argument that in fact the slowness of the approval process, which they say is getting worse and worse, means that people are dying when they could-- %$* 13
if they could get into the trials, if they could get the drug released, put on the market. %$* 13
and whatever it is, the way that they could get access to it around the testing process, the more people would be alive today. %$* 13
there's a logic to it, and i'd like to hear your response to it. %$* 13
there's a logic to it, but there's not facts to it. %$* 296
why not? %$* 13
i think laying out a pretty good argument would require that there be data to substantiate it, and i think the data are pretty clear that we are not slower than other countries on earth. %$* 296
on average, we are faster, and we have access to drugs granted in the united states faster than they are in other countries. %$* 296
and so while the concept of a bunch of pointy-headed bureaucrats waking up in the morning in washington saying, "how can i hurt people who are sick? %$* 296
" that's not the way the fda operates. %$* 296
in fact, they are every bit as fast, at least on the drug side, which i'm more familiar with-- %$* 296
all right. %$* 13
let's let the other side respond to your claim that in fact the facts support their argument that the-- %$* 13
it's not a question-- %$* 295
again, we can't talk about review times and who's faster at reviewing applications. %$* 295
it's a question of development times. %$* 295
and you can't say that it - - %$* 295
make the distinction, please. %$* 13
development times are the years it takes to go through those three phases of clinical trials you asked about. %$* 295
and development times are guided by the clinical trials that companies are forced to do. %$* 295
and the clinical trials that companies are forced to do are determined by what the fda asks for because this is the biggest market. %$* 295
you can't develop a drug just for the european market. %$* 295
so if the fda says that they want that outrageous phase iii clinical trial that's going to take five years, the companies do it. %$* 295
and so the drug isn't available here or europe. %$* 295
scott, what is review time, then? %$* 13
review time is the amount of time that it takes fda to actually review the application once it's submitted to the agency. %$* 295
so it could be six-- %$* 295
as short as six months and 12 months-- %$* 295
all right, now i'm following your point. %$* 13
now i'm following your point about this distinction between development time and review time. %$* 13
so i want to bring that question back to you. %$* 13
they're not talking about how long it takes for the paperwork to get done. %$* 13
they're talking about how long the company has to spend getting the drug to the point where they can actually present the paperwork. %$* 13
that process is the one that is bogged down in increasing-- %$* 13
increasingly arduous demands to improve safety statistically. %$* 13
and that's getting worse, and that as a result of that, people are dying. %$* 13
i think it is fair to say-- %$* 296
david challoner. %$* 13
no, go ahead, david. %$* 296
all right. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
jerry's better-- %$* 297
okay, sure. %$* 13
i'll do the drugs; i've been doing it for a long time. %$* 296
and david can do the devices. %$* 296
jerry avorn. %$* 13
i think we need to, first of all, ask, what are we keeping from patients. %$* 296
if-- %$* 296
to speak about this new tb drug, if i were a patient with tuberculosis, i don't think i would want to have accelerated access to a drug that quintuples my risk of death, doesn't treat tuberculosis, and then have to wait ten years to find out if it really works. %$* 296
so a drug that is-- %$* 296
what if-- %$* 13
what if you're in a truly acute situation? %$* 13
you're going to die, and you're willing to try anything. %$* 13
that's a really interesting ethical issue that brings up the issue of laetrile, which many people will have remembered. %$* 296
that was an extract of apricot pits. %$* 296
and a lot of patients wanted to get it because they had cancer. %$* 296
and back in, what, the 1960s or '70s, people thought that cured cancer. %$* 296
i don't think we should give access to treatments that haven't been shown to work to people, however much they want it. %$* 296
now, that may make me a paternalistic person, but if we go back to an era where anyone who wants access to a drug that has not been shown to work can get it, then we're back into the thalidomide era. %$* 296
i don't think they're arguing a drug-- %$* 13
peter huber, i want to bring in because you've been very silent for the last few minutes, and it's your turn. %$* 13
i'm not sure that you're arguing that you want people to have access to a drug that has been shown not to work, right? %$* 13
no, actually-- %$* 101
not shown to work, sorry. %$* 13
my fault. %$* 13
no, i want people to have access to a drug we've developed the science so well that we know it will work in that patient, not in the crowd that exists somewhere in the fda's computers. %$* 101
and that requires the use of the very best tools of modern molecular medicine. %$* 101
and i ask you to think very carefully, where are they being used systematically, okay? %$* 101
they're being used after a drug gets licensed, okay? %$* 101
under the fda's standard protocols, we are not developing that science. %$* 101
we should be. %$* 101
it's the-- %$* 101
the-- %$* 101
i think it's almost required by law. %$* 101
the fda doesn't license a drug. %$* 101
it licenses a drug plus a label. %$* 101
the label is saying, is it safe and effective in these circumstances of use? %$* 101
and the fda is not developing any of that science. %$* 101
during the trial, it scripts every step of the way. %$* 101
the one exception is under the accelerated approval rule where-- %$* 101
david-- %$* 13
it cuts it out and lets the process-- %$* 101
david challoner. %$* 13
let me step in on the drug side, even though i'm not as expert. %$* 297
when you-- %$* 297
with some of these new highly focused therapies that are designed-- %$* 297
specifically molecularly designed for a very small group of identifiable patients because of something we know about their genes, those can be given on a humanitarian exemption. %$* 297
and the patients who are idiosyncratic and small in number can be dealt with by exceptions from the old, large population processes that we've been talking about. %$* 297
so it's not as if the fda is standing in the way of the progress of modern american medical science because of allowing some of these new and highly refined molecular therapies to be used, they can't-- %$* 297
well, that's not-- %$* 295
i mean-- %$* 295
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
there's another elephant in the room here, which is, there is a lessening of a trust in physicians' ability to prescribe drugs appropriately based on the label. %$* 295
and i don't want to misquote your book, but i think you expressed that, too, in your book, that you don't fully trust doctors. %$* 295
and so the problem is that dr. %$* 295

and i want to introduce the gentleman who has brought this program to the stage and has produced now almost 100 intelligence squared debates. %$* 13
we're in the high 90s. %$* 13
so, please welcome the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
so, bob and i always take a couple of minutes to talk ahead of time just a little bit about why we've chosen this debate and a little bit about the timing. %$* 13
and just in terms of timing-- %$* 13
and we plan these several months in advance. %$* 13
but talk to me about where we, you know, where we are on the timing of this one now. %$* 13
well, the timing of this-- %$* 1
i mean, we couldn't have a more timely debate. %$* 1
when you have americans having their heads cut off on video and showed on television, it just so demands a response that the timing is just incredible. %$* 1
and the response is obviously forward-looking. %$* 13
but how much are we actually here, in trying to wrestle with this topic, going to be talking about history? %$* 13
well, i think both sides have a fair amount of history to bring to the table. %$* 1
i mean, there's plenty of history of muscle-flexing, by which we mean military action, that have produced terrible and unintended consequences. %$* 1
and there are also plenty of examples of inaction that have produced pretty bad consequences, too. %$* 1
so, both sides are going to have a fair amount of history to cite tonight. %$* 1
and as you say, for clarification, what we're talking about when we're talking about muscle-flexing, we are talking about the use of military force, the use of american might. %$* 13
it could be broader than that, but for the sake of clarity, we're focusing on that. %$* 13
and to the degree that they both now are going to be making historical arguments, well, what do they need to nail-- %$* 13
to really nail down in order to persuade this audience to vote with them? %$* 13
well, i think one of the debaters that we had on the middle east last year, graham allison at harvard, set out a kind of set of criteria or ways of thinking about foreign policy challenges that i think, if we keep in mind tonight, we're going to have as a good guide to listening to tonight's debate. %$* 1
the first question really is what happens? %$* 1
what is happening? %$* 1
what's actually going on? %$* 1
the second question is, why does it matter? %$* 1
the third question is, it may matter, but how does it rank in importance versus all of the other things out there that matter as claims on our attention, on our resources, and our political will. %$* 1
the fourth question is, what are the risks of inaction, of doing nothing? %$* 1
the fifth question is, what courses of action are actually open to us and available? %$* 1
and the final question is to try to evaluate those courses of action in terms of their risks, in terms of their costs, and in terms of their benefits, and to see if any of them meet the bar of being better than a course of inaction, given an understanding of all of those other points. %$* 1
so, they all seem to shape around this question of action versus inaction, which i think is the crux of what we're going to be talking about tonight. %$* 13
so, bob rosenkranz, thank you very much for the warm-up. %$* 13
and let's please welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
you guys do very good applause. %$* 13
that was excellent. %$* 13
i just want to ask for one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
once upon a time, the u.s.had it all worked out. %$* 13
speak softly and carry a big stick. %$* 13
as we all learned in the seventh grade, those were the words of teddy roosevelt. %$* 13
his wise approach to the world. %$* 13
there was just one thing about it, and that was about the big stick. %$* 13
he didn't say how big it should be and how fast we should swing it and at who and how often. %$* 13
and those are questions that are bedeviling the united states right now. %$* 13
when they're cutting off the heads of americans in a middle east that is in a spin cycle of disintegration. %$* 13
and what is the u.s. supposed to do about this, and with its big stick, which is the strongest military on earth, run away, get more deeply involved, stay on the sidelines? %$* 13
and how is that "speaking softly" thing really working out? %$* 13
well, this sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then you, our live audience here in new york, votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, first welcome aaron david miller. %$* 13
and, aaron david miller, you are at the wilson center. %$* 13
you served for two decades at the department of state helping formulate u.s. policy on the middle east and the arab- israeli peace process, an aspiring peace maker. %$* 13
in 1990, though, you were working with secretary of state james baker who said to you, rather famously, "aaron, if i had another life, i would want to be a middle east specialist just like you because it would mean guaranteed permanent employment." was he right about that? %$* 13
baker-- %$* 138
baker was one smart guy. %$* 138
he had no idea just how right he was. %$* 138
all right, thanks, aaron david miller. %$* 13
and, aaron, your partner is? %$* 13
paul pillar. %$* 138
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome paul pillar. %$* 13
paul, welcome. %$* 13
and you are also arguing for the motion, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
you are a senior fellow at the center for security studies at georgetown. %$* 13
twenty-eight years as an analyst at the cia.during the last five years as national intelligence officer, specializing in the near east and south africa. %$* 13
you once said an interesting thing, that, in major foreign policy decisions, though you were at the cia, you said, "intelligence is not the decisive factor. %$* 13
it's actually something about the leader himself, his own strategic sense, his lessons from history, his personal experience, even his personal neuroses."is that true for president obama? %$* 13
well, the president hasn't invited me to the white house for one of those chats over a beer to talk it over, but like all of our other presidents, he's a human being, and he's a political annual too, and so the answer, john, is yes. %$* 139
all right. %$* 13
thank you, paul pillar. %$* 13
i just got a note in my ear that i said something wrong about paul? %$* 13
what was it? %$* 13
did i say south africa? %$* 13
let me just pretend that i didn't say any of that, and i'm just going to read it so that it can be edited-- %$* 13
wouldn't it be great for everybody if life was like this? %$* 13
you just rewind, and all of your mistakes went away. %$* 13
well, i get to do it. %$* 13
very briefly. %$* 13
i'm just going to say this: specializing in the northeast-- %$* 13
specializing in the-- %$* 13
specializing in the near east and south asia. %$* 13
thank you for your patience. %$* 13
it's so embarrassing. %$* 13
the only way to be-- %$* 13
to handle the embarrassment is to pretend i'm not embarrassed at all. %$* 13
our motion is this: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
and we have two teams arguing against the motion. %$* 13
please, folks, let's welcome michael doran. %$* 13
michael, you're a senior fellow at the brookings institute. %$* 13
and prior to that, you were professor at princeton. %$* 13
you also served as deputy assistant secretary of defense in public diplomacy. %$* 13
you were a senior director for the near east and north africa at the national security council. %$* 13
and we were listening to a recent interview you gave where you actually advised people not to take up middle eastern studies. %$* 13
why is that? %$* 13
because it's so contentious that if you say anything serious you'll be deeply hated. %$* 140
so you have a choice between being boring and anodyne and liked or serious and hated. %$* 140
but you're not going to be boring and anodyne. %$* 13
i'm going to be-- %$* 140
i'm going to be anodyne and loved. %$* 140
all right. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
mike doran, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, mike, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is wall street journal and pulitzer prize-winning columnist, bret stephens. %$* 140
bret stephens, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
bret, you are also arguing against the motion, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
your background has just been described, so i'm going to skip straight to your first book, which was called "america in retreat: the new isolationism and the coming global disorder" coming out in november. %$* 13
and joe lieberman said of this book, "it's worth buying even if you only read chapter 9." what's in chapter 9? %$* 13
well, the other nine chapters are terrific, but in chapter 9-- %$* 141
you get the world as i see it in 2019 when hillary clinton is president and wondering why she ever wanted that job in the first place. %$* 141
so it's a-- %$* 13
it's a prophetic novel? %$* 13
we'll see. %$* 141
all right. %$* 13
i guess not. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
this is the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
so, i want to remind you, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
and one team will win, and one team will lose. %$* 13
and that decision will be made by you, our live audience, by your vote, both before you hear the arguments and again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's get on to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those key pads at your seat on the right hand side, there are a lot of keys on them, but you only need to pay attention to 1, 2 and 3. %$* 13
push number 1 if you agree with the motion at this point that this side's arguing for; and push number 2 if you disagree with the motion, this side; and push number 3 if you're undecided, which is a perfectly honorable position. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you feel you made an error, just correct yourself, and it'll lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and we'll take about another 10 seconds. %$* 13
then at the end of the debate, we do the same thing, and we get the results in about a minute, minute and a half, something like that. %$* 13
they'll be carried out to me, and i will announce them, and i will announce our winner. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
onto round one. %$* 13
round one, are opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are uninterrupted. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
here to speak first for the motion and making his way to the lectern, paul pillar. %$* 13
he's a nonresident senior fellow at the center for security studies at georgetown university and at the brookings institution. %$* 13
he served 28 years in the u.s. intelligence community. %$* 13
he is here to argue for the motion, flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul pillar. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 139
flexing muscles, that sounds like posturing, doesn't it? %$* 139
and posturing doesn't sound like a very good way to conduct foreign policy. %$* 139
it's not. %$* 139
but, look, we know what this motion is all about. %$* 139
it's about the use of the most salient form of muscle the u.s.has, and that's military force. %$* 139
and so that's what aaron and i are going to talk about. %$* 139
we're not pacifists. %$* 139
the military instrument has a legitimate role, carefully used in certain times and places. %$* 139
but unless we carefully consider all the costs and risks and limitations and consequences and reactions to our use of military force, it can, and unfortunately very often in the past has, made things worse. %$* 139
now, aaron's going to talk later about some of the specific issues we've got facing us in the middle east. %$* 139
i want to start by talking about how we ought to think about this question. %$* 139
we hear a lot of "if only" kind of arguments: "if only we used force here or used more force," or "if only we had used more force or put our troops in here or there, something better would happen." lots of speculation, lots of counterfactuals. %$* 139
we don't have to dwell just with speculation and counterfactuals. %$* 139
we have a real record out there of having done a lot of application of military force in this region. %$* 139
data point number one-- %$* 139
in fact, there's a whole string of data points-- %$* 139
was, of course, the invasion of iraq, which extended an expedition for another eight and a half years. %$* 139
that made things a lot worse for the united states, considering the trillion dollars of cost and the casualties and everything else. %$* 139
it made things worse for the region because it was a negative example of the so- called birth pangs of democracy and because it stimulated the kinds of sectarian conflict and consciousness we see in syria and elsewhere. %$* 139
and it was certainly bad for iraq which-- %$* 139
where it touched off a civil war that has never ended and also gave rise to various forms of extremism. %$* 139
that group isis, or islamic states, or isil, or whatever you want to call it that we're so worried about today, it was born under a different name as a direct response to our invasion of iraq and the civil war it touched off. %$* 139
isil did not exist before we went into iraq. %$* 139
and to talk about iraq in the past is not just dwelling in the past, it raises the very issues which aaron will go into more that we're still facing today. %$* 139
now, one thing you hear often in the sort of "if only" category is "if only we had somehow kept troops there beyond the eight and a half years, that somehow things would have worked out differently."now, set aside the question of how that could have been done when we had an iraqi government that was determined to get us out and the previous administration under mr. %$* 139
bush was the one that set the withdrawal deadline. %$* 139
but the fact is we did try to up the ante militarily. %$* 139
we had the so-called surge. %$* 139
you remember that? %$* 139
and it, along with some other factors, like disillusionment with the extremists among iraqi-sunni arabs, temporarily brought down the level of violence. %$* 139
but the surge failed in its more fundamental political objective of providing the space for iraqi politicians to reach an accommodation and build a new and more stable iraqi political order. %$* 139
they never did that, and we have the mess that we see today in iraq. %$* 139
and anyone who thinks otherwise i think has to answer the question: if eight and a half years were not enough, then how many years would be enough? %$* 139
let me just mention one other thing in the past briefly, because it comes under a different administration: the intervention in libya. %$* 139
now, there you already have a civil war going, but we used force to help overthrow gaddafi, and look at the mess that libya's in now. %$* 139
about the closest thing we have in the region to it, total anarchy. %$* 139
and i might remind you, whatever you might have thought of the late mr. %$* 139
gaddafi, years before any use of force or even threatening the use of force, he got out of the international terrorism business and he gave up his unconventional weapons programs, leaving him as a sort of quaint and curious dictator, but, frankly, not much of a threat to u.s.interests. %$* 139
so, what's going on here? %$* 139
why do we have these unfortunate results? %$* 139
well, i think there are several patterns that we've seen again and again. %$* 139
one is military force is good to accomplish a lot of things. %$* 139
it's pretty poor to accomplish a lot of other things. %$* 139
the u.s.military's a great hammer, but some of the thorniest problems we've got in the middle east simply are not nails. %$* 139
building political and social order is not primarily a matter of killing people. %$* 139
one's a matter of construction. %$* 139
the other's a matter of destruction. %$* 139
what has mattered again and again in places like syria and iraq and libya and elsewhere is political will and political culture and the will to reach political accommodation. %$* 139
and that can't be injected through the barrel of a gun. %$* 139
closely related to that is the principle that we need the people in the region and the players in the region to become owners of any solution. %$* 139
if it's just outsiders, whether it's the united states or someone else, then whatever good effect may be brought about, as long as we've got the strength there, like we had 168,000 troops at one point in iraq, is not going to last, just like the benefits of the surge didn't last. %$* 139
another thing that's happened when we flexed our muscle in this way in the middle east is the united states has been taking sides in someone else's internal conflict, which in that part of the world is often defined in sectarian or ethnic terms. %$* 139
and that's no good either. %$* 139
it's an invitation for the other side to get more involved. %$* 139
and for the united states, we have no interest-- %$* 139
no national interest-- %$* 139
in taking sides in someone's sectarian civil war. %$* 139
and finally, again and again, we see our use of our muscle engendering the reaction of hatred and anti-americanism and extremism and terrorism, partly because of the inevitable collateral damage, partly because we're who we are, the superpower, hated, because we come in with our boots trampling on someone else's ground. %$* 139
so, again and again, we see the reaction, including when osama bin laden was initially radicalized as a result of u.s.troops going into saudi arabia, or when isis was born after we went into iraq, or today when isis is committing those grisly murders and justifying it by saying it's in response to something we've done. %$* 139
so, the middle east is a pretty messy place. %$* 139
it can get messier. %$* 139
and to prevent us from making it even messier, we have to ask not what we would hope would happen or wish would happen with the application of military force, but to look at what we've done in the past and how often it has, in fact, made things worse. %$* 139
thank you. %$* 139
thank you, paul pillar. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will make things worse.” and our next debater will be speaking against the motion. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the lectern bret stephens. %$* 13
he is a deputy editorial page editor and foreign affairs columnist for the wall street journal, and author of the forthcoming book, “america in retreat: the new isolationism and the coming global disorder”. please welcome bret stephens. %$* 13
well thank you, john. %$* 141
it's an honor-- %$* 141
and i want to say this with real sincerity-- %$* 141
to be debating two very distinguished public servants, each of whom has done a lot for this country. %$* 141
how distinguished, you might ask? %$* 141
so distinguished that they are prepared to take an intellectual bullet tonight-- %$* 141
if not for their country, then for this audience-- %$* 141
in order to defend an implausible, illogical, and frankly nonsensical proposition that neither of them can possibly believe is true. %$* 141
the proposition we are debating this evening is this: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse, by which we mean, intervening militarily. %$* 141
notice that it falls to paul and aaron to defend that statement categorically-- %$* 141
no exceptions. %$* 141
they must convince you that, no matter what the circumstance, u.s.military intervention in the middle east cannot be the answer. %$* 141
but also notice this: michael and i are not arguing the opposite case. %$* 141
we are not saying, “bomb every time and everything.” we are not saying, “whatever the question, war is the answer.” this is a caricature position, and all of you in this room are, frankly, too smart for that. %$* 141
right? %$* 141
what we are saying is that, in the middle east, as in the world, as in life itself, you take it on a case-by-case basis. %$* 141
you look at the circumstances. %$* 141
you distinguish between the preferable and the necessary; the merely important versus the absolutely vital. %$* 141
what we are arguing is not dogma and not absolutism. %$* 141
we are arguing the case for pragmatism. %$* 141
ladies and gentlemen, ask yourselves this: if you were the president and you were in a position to use force to prevent the massacre by isis of the yazidi people, would you authorize force? %$* 141
would you do what barack obama did? %$* 141
would you send flights of f18s to relieve the siege of sinjar mountain? %$* 141
or would that simply have made things worse? %$* 141
when the other week, tens of thousands of kurds faced death at the hands of isis, would you have used air power, as president obama did, to help them get to safety? %$* 141
or would you have left them to their own devices? %$* 141
would military force in that circumstance make things worse? %$* 141
ladies and gentlemen, if you had been george h. w. bush in the spring of 1991 when saddam hussein was besieging the kurds in northern iraq, would you have launched operation provide comfort to save them? %$* 141
or did that just make things worse? %$* 141
now, i know what you're thinking, and i know what they're going to say: these aren't really military interventions. %$* 141
they're quasi-humanitarian rescue efforts. %$* 141
but that's not true. %$* 141
when bombs are being dropped, that's not humanitarian work. %$* 141
american fighter pilots are not ngo workers. %$* 141
gps-guided bombs are not care packages. %$* 141
all of this is an example of flexing america's muscles; of using the american military in the service of a good cause. %$* 141
so, the question before you tonight is, are you for it, at least occasionally? %$* 141
or are you against it in every circumstance? %$* 141
now, let's take another example: when saddam hussein invaded kuwait in the summer of 1990, and george h.w.bush said this aggression will not stand. %$* 141
was he wrong to oppose it? %$* 141
would the world have been a better place if saddam had simply swallowed kuwait whole? %$* 141
is that the kind of world that you want to live in? %$* 141
maybe if you're vladimir putin, that's the world you would like to live in. %$* 141
but i'm asking you, the audience. %$* 141
aren't we better off that that aggression was opposed, just as bill clinton opposed serbian aggression in bosnia and kosovo? %$* 141
now, we remember the 1990s as this halcyon period for america, and indeed it was. %$* 141
and it was a great period because the world understood the u.s.was prepared to enforce the rules of international order with force when those rules were flagrantly violated by tin-pot dictators with genocidal tendencies. %$* 141
now, you heard from paul, and soon you're going to hear from aaron. %$* 141
and they will tell you, “yes, but what about the intervention in lebanon in 1983, and how did that turn out? %$* 141
and what about iraq, as paul just mentioned, and afghanistan, and maybe the prospect of bombing iran in the event that nuclear negotiations go nowhere? %$* 141
” let me make two points about this. %$* 141
noting that military interventions and wars can go horribly wrong is not an argument in this debate. %$* 141
it is totally beside the point. %$* 141
world war i may have been totally pointless, but world war ii was not pointless. %$* 141
like everything in life, there are just wars and unjust wars, smart wars and dumb wars, smart wars that are badly executed and dumb wars that are well executed. %$* 141
and the second point is this: telling us that actions have consequences, particularly unintended consequences, tells us nothing about the consequences of inaction, because what we are seeing today, contrary to what paul just mentioned, in the middle east-- %$* 141
the near collapse of the iraqi government; mass executions; the fall of cities like mosul, tikrit and fallujah; the vortex in syria; the progressive radicalization of the syrian opposition to the point that even al-qaeda isn't radical enough; the beheading of journalists; millions of refugees straining the resources of lebanon and jordan and turkey-- %$* 141
all this is not the consequence of flexing america's muscles. %$* 141
it is a consequence of a presidential decision in the last four years not to flex those muscles. %$* 141
each of us, in our everyday lives, know that every action carries risks, but there is also a price to be paid when we do nothing, when you don't make the phone call, when you don't challenge your colleague, when you don't make the move to another job. %$* 141
foreign policy is not that different. %$* 141
ladies and gentlemen, it would be nice to live in a world where the best policy is to do nothing, to look away, to always choose the peaceful route, to offer kindness and get kindness in return, to always take the diplomatic option. %$* 141
but you and i and they don't live in that world. %$* 141
we live in the world as it is, not the one we'd like to pretend it to be. %$* 141
and in that world, as it is, you sometimes need to flex your muscles, prudently, discriminately, effectively, yes. %$* 141
but to choose simply never to exercise those muscles at all is an absurd motion. %$* 141
i urge you to reject it. %$* 141
thank you. %$* 141
thank you, bret stephens. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, arguing it out over this motion: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
you have heard from the first two debaters, and now onto the third. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome aaron david miller. %$* 13
he is vice president for new initiatives at the wilson center. %$* 13
he served in the department of state for two decades and has a new book out next week, "the end of greatness: why america can't have and doesn't want another great president." he's debating for the motion: flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, aaron david miller. %$* 13
john, thank you very much. %$* 138
it's an honor and privilege to be here. %$* 138
it's an honor to debate mike and bret, friendly but formidable opponents, and it's wonderful to be here with paul pillar who brings a measure of honesty and clarity to this debate, sometimes controversial, but it is sorely needed. %$* 138
i really do find myself, unfortunately, sadly, paradoxically, in the anomalous position of agreeing with almost everything bret said. %$* 138
and at the risk of never being invited back to iq2-- %$* 138
i have to say at the outset that this is a national conversation that is simply too important to be constrained and confined to simple propositions. %$* 138
i will defend the proposition, but the nuance is clear. %$* 138
and bret made the case, and that is to say there is smart muscle flexing-- %$* 138
the effective application, formidable application of american military power-- %$* 138
and there is dumb muscle flexing. %$* 138
and that anomaly, that inconsistency, has to be reflected not just in the debate but in the actual execution of policy. %$* 138
if the application of american military power had always been smart, we wouldn't be having these conversations, and i'd be applauding michael and bret for everything that they've said in their compelling arguments, nor would i have ever agreed to debate and argue for the proposition. %$* 138
but sadly, that has not been the case. %$* 138
muscle flexing has, on balance, in my judgment, as my inestimable partner, paul pillar, has mentioned, it's messy, and it's, for the united states, been on balance a very unhappy enterprise. %$* 138
and it is likely to remain unhappy as well. %$* 138
this is not to say-- %$* 138
and i want to repeat this for my own personal credibility and what remains of my professional reputation-- %$* 138
the reality is that the application of military power can be effective, can be appropriate. %$* 138
bush 41, for whom i worked, pushing saddam out of kuwait. %$* 138
go read baker's memoir of why bush didn't continue that operation to baghdad. %$* 138
read baker's prescient memoir about the risks, the limitations, and the constraints. %$* 138
bush 43's application of military power in afghanistan, air power, local allies, good intel, managed in a manner of months to defeat al-qaeda and to decimate the taliban, at least for the moment. %$* 138
but in recent years, i would argue to you, respectfully and humbly, we have not been nearly as effective as in years past. %$* 138
in fact, i would argue that the u.s.is like some modern-day gulliver, wandering around in a part of the world that it does not understand, constrained by its own illusions, by smaller powers whose interests are not its own all the time. %$* 138
and in search of hollywood endings to a region that is broken, angry, and dysfunctional, and offers up not solutions and definitive outcomes at all, but just outcomes. %$* 138
and do not let our debating opponents try to persuade you that this is a republican issue or a democratic issue. %$* 138
i worked for rs and ds. %$* 138
i voted for rs and ds. %$* 138
and i can tell you, with some authority, that muscle flexing, dumb muscle flexing, is a bipartisan-- %$* 138
as well as equal opportunity employer. %$* 138
twain quipped, and he was right, famously, that history does not repeat-- %$* 138
it does not repeat. %$* 138
history rhymes. %$* 138
and it's the rhythmic patterns that you need to pay attention to when it comes to smart application of american military power. %$* 138
let me identify four, perhaps five, cautionary tales with respect to why you need to support our rendition of this emotion-- %$* 138
of this motion. %$* 138
number one: there is muscle flexing as overreach. %$* 138
paul has referred to iraq, what i call-- %$* 138
not to trivialize the men and women who served, who died, and who suffered life-crippling injuries from which they will never, ever recover. %$* 138
this turned out to be, in my judgment, with all due respect, a trillion dollar social science experiment that fundamentally failed. %$* 138
it caused 6,000 americans dead, trillions expended, most of our credibility in tatters. %$* 138
and for what? %$* 138
a standard of victory was not, could we win, but when could we leave? %$* 138
and extrication is not a metric that you want to use to judge the performance of the most consequential power on earth. %$* 138
that's muscle flexing as overreach. %$* 138
then you have muscle flexing as bluster. %$* 138
that is to say, talk without action. %$* 138
and i would argue, even though i have supported the president's willful refusal to militarize the american role in syria in order to defeat assad-- %$* 138
isis is a different story now-- %$* 138
that was an example of talk without action. %$* 138
that is dumb muscle flexing because it erodes and undermines credibility. %$* 138
presidential rhetoric has to be rooted in reality. %$* 138
if you say it, you've got to mean it, and you have to follow through. %$* 138
then we have what i call one-off muscle flexing. %$* 138
that's libya. %$* 138
that's where we and nato took eight months to take care of colonel q, but without much regard or thought to the implications of what would come next. %$* 138
and we lost the first sitting ambassador since 1979, chris stevens, as a consequence. %$* 138
fourth, there is split-the-difference muscle flexing. %$* 138
i support the president's strategy in syria, but it is replete with anomalies and contradiction that are going to be extremely difficult to maintain. %$* 138
we strike isis, we essentially empower assad. %$* 138
we try to take out assad, we leave the field open to isis.caliphates in damascus, with baghdad next. %$* 138
and fifth-- %$* 138
and this is why this is deadly serious. %$* 138
what is happening tonight, this conversation is not some sort of academic exercise. %$* 138
the mother of all military interventions may be not far away. %$* 138
if negotiations do not produce a comprehensive accord, if sanctions do not work with respect to the mullahs in tehran, if the mullahs accelerate their program, this president has set his own red line. %$* 138
he will not allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. %$* 138
we have committed ourselves to the israelis repeatedly over the last several years not to preempt, we will do it for them. %$* 138
so i urge you when you vote, think about the consequences and implications, both for and against, of the application of military power. %$* 138
let me conclude by simply saying neither this administration that has been risk averse or the last one that has been too risk ready has got it right. %$* 138
the next time we apply military force, we need to think through how, why, and where. %$* 138
all right, aaron david miller, i'm sorry your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "flexing america’s muscles in the middle east will make things worse." and our final opening statement will be against this motion, like to welcome mike doran. %$* 13
he's a senior fellow in the center for middle east policy at the brookings institution. %$* 13
he served as senior director for the near east and north africa at the national security council. %$* 13
please welcome mike doran. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 140
and thank all of you for coming. %$* 140
it's a great pleasure to be here. %$* 140
it's an honor. %$* 140
it truly is an honor to be debating aaron and paul and to be on the same team with somebody as talented and silver tongued as bret stephens. %$* 140
handsome. %$* 140
handsome, silver tongued, and talented. %$* 140
i thought that what aaron just said was very wise and very gracious. %$* 140
i noted, as you did, that he accepted our victory. %$* 140
he agreed with everything that bret said. %$* 140
and so i would very graciously like, in complete reciprocity and the spirit of reciprocity, i accept your admission of defeat. %$* 140
and i accept your challenge to discuss this in terms other than the motion. %$* 140
look, it's true that we have to have wise use of force as opposed to dumb use of force. %$* 140
i think we can all agree to that. %$* 140
if we're going to say though, as i think paul and aaron are, that we need to have a kind of bias in favor of restraint, then you're saying one of two things. %$* 140
you're saying that action is either going to-- %$* 140
military action is either going to destroy some beneficial process that is ongoing, or you're saying that it is going to generate some new bad process that doesn't exist. %$* 140
and i think that, that proposition, the proposition basically that paul laid out, is the one that president obama accepted when he took office in 2009 and he made policy toward the middle east-- %$* 140
from 2009 up until yesterday or a couple of weeks ago-- %$* 140
on the basis that restraint is almost always better than the use of military action. %$* 140
and i look at the last five years as a kind of referendum on that proposition, and i think it comes up, and it comes up faulty. %$* 140
and i'd like to explain to you why. %$* 140
so, what did we see over the last five years? %$* 140
we saw, first of all, in iraq, we saw the maliki government become increasingly sectarian, increasingly dependent on iraq, and increasingly dictatorial. %$* 140
and it alienated the sunni arabs living in al-anbar province and in the north. %$* 140
now, paul said that the surge did not stop the civil war, it just lowered the violence a little bit. %$* 140
it's not true. %$* 140
it's not true. %$* 140
the surge created a political space that maliki could have used to have created a more inclusive government. %$* 140
it needed, though-- %$* 140
that process needed continued american pressure, which the obama administration would not apply. %$* 140
and so david petraeus handed to the obama administration and he handed to maliki an opportunity that was lost. %$* 140
now, that's what was happening in iraq, so the civil war started up again in a vicious sectarian fashion, alienated the sunnis. %$* 140
meanwhile in syria another civil war started, which had nothing to do whatsoever with the application of american force. %$* 140
it started completely as a result of indigenous processes. %$* 140
but there, too, we have a sectarian shiite government aligned with iran that is destroying sunnis. %$* 140
now, think about the extent of the destruction in syria. %$* 140
syria's a country of around 20 million people. %$* 140
nine million of them, possibly even 10 million of them are now displaced. %$* 140
that's almost half the entire population of the country has been displaced. %$* 140
three million of them have been driven out of syria and are now refugees in the surrounding countries and risking to destabilize those countries. %$* 140
let's not even mention the systematic rape, the torture, the dropping of bombs onto breadlines as women and children wait to buy bread, by the assad regime and supported by iran. %$* 140
so, if you want to say that using military force is going to stop some kind of beneficial process that is ongoing, you can't make the argument, because if you look at what's happening, the middle east is spiraling out of control. %$* 140
and that's why president obama finally had to apply force, because there was this process spiraling out at full force. %$* 140
now, back in 2012, his national security council went to him and said, “you have to apply force. %$* 140
you have to arm the syrian opposition.” this was david patraeus, hillary clinton, leon panetta, and so forth. %$* 140
and president obama said, “no, i won't do it.” now, at the same time that this argument was going on, sarah palin was asked what she thought about this. %$* 140
sarah palin-- %$* 140
the war was going on and she was asked, “should we arm the syrian opposition like the national security council wants to? %$* 140
” and she said, “no.” she said, “my answer is, let allah sort them out, right? %$* 140
let the sunnis and shiites kill each other.” now, that is basically the policy that president obama followed. %$* 140
he didn't call it that, but that's what he did. %$* 140
he let allah sort it out. %$* 140
that is the policy that paul pillar and aaron david miller are calling for. %$* 140
they're saying, “let allah sort it out”-- %$* 140
the sarah palin doctrine. %$* 140
we know-- %$* 140
we now know that the sarah palin strategy does not work. %$* 140
it does not work. %$* 140
we have to use military power. %$* 140
and we have to use military power. %$* 140
now, paul pillar said something interesting. %$* 140
he said, “you cannot-- %$* 140
you can't make people increase their will by use of military force.” this is patently not true. %$* 140
the fact of the matter is that what we have in the middle east are countries run by mafias, basically, or organizations like isis that are first and foremost mafia organizations. %$* 140
if somebody goes to the united states and beheads its citizens on television and the united states says, “i'm not going to do anything,” it sends a message to all of our allies in the region that if we're not going to go take action when our citizens are beheaded, we're certainly not going to come help them. %$* 140
and that encourages them to go and cut a deal with the mafia rather than showing the will to fight. %$* 140
if we don't put skin in the game-- %$* 140
and skin in the game means military force-- %$* 140
then we will not-- %$* 140
then we will undermine the will of our allies whom we need. %$* 140
thank you. %$* 140
thank you, michael doran. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
so, remember how you voted when the evening began. %$* 13
and we're going to have you vote again after the debate concludes. %$* 13
and once again, i want to emphasize that the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is flexing america's muscles in the middle east will make things worse. %$* 13
we have heard from each of the teams now-- %$* 13
two teams of two. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, paul pillar and aaron david miller, made a presentation in which they said they are not against all use of force all of the timethey are against the use of force in a dumb way, that force has a downside, and that downside is unintended consequences that have costs. %$* 13
they ran through situations in history where this has already occurred, most recently iraq and, in 2003, a situation they said that gave us isis.they point out that once the u.s.gets into the middle east militarily, then it's in a situation of taking sides. %$* 13
and that doesn't win us friends, it produces anti-american sentiment and it ends up having the united states pushed around by small time dictators. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, michael doran and bret stephens, argue themselves. %$* 13
they say that inaction also has unintended consequences. %$* 13
and they say, also, that that has been seen in the disintegration of iraq and in the creation of isis.their argument is that a u.s.that is seen to be passive looks weak. %$* 13
it's an invitation to rogue states to act even more roguely. %$* 13
they blame-- %$* 13
they basically say that the argument that restraint most of the time is the right option is actually the wrong option. %$* 13
and they also make a case based on history. %$* 13
so, what i'm finding-- %$* 13
there's a worrying amount of agreement between the two sides here on the-- %$* 13
on the basic-- %$* 13
they're agreement with us. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
the basic-- %$* 13
the basic point that you're-- %$* 13
you're only in favor of force when it's intelligent, and you're in favor of force when it's intelligent. %$* 13
so we can all go home now, except that i do-- %$* 13
i do think that there's actually a debate here. %$* 13
and as aaron david miller pointed out, there's a national conversation about this, and that's what i am here to help us tease out, because there were points that made-- %$* 13
that were made in case-- %$* 13
and examples of specific cases. %$* 13
and i think what we want to do is go look at some of these specifics but we know on them what we're talking about. %$* 13
we're talking about, where do we go from here, and what's happened in the recent past. %$* 13
and i want to-- %$* 13
i want to look at the fact that president obama did indeed take a relatively restrained view on the situation in syria and iraq until august of 2014 at which time he stepped up the military force. %$* 13
and that makes me want to ask the side that's arguing for the motion, did the president-- %$* 13
was the president once on your side on this argument, and then he switched to the other side? %$* 13
aaron david miller. %$* 13
again, we're constrained and confined by a motion that is, in many respects, really not appropriate to the national conversation that has to be had. %$* 138
this president, frankly, is risk averse, except in one area where he has emerged to be george w.bush on steroids. %$* 138
and that is the protection-- %$* 138
that is the protection of the continental united states. %$* 138
he's killed ten times the number of, however you want to describe them, terrorists, militants, extremists, with predator drones. %$* 138
he's expanded the drone war to pakistan, to yemen, to somalia. %$* 138
he killed bin laden. %$* 138
he dismantled al-qaeda core. %$* 138
so, let me stop you before you go too far down that road because i think we see where you're going. %$* 13
so are you saying that he has been a muscle flexor and that it has not made things worse? %$* 13
what i'm saying is the reason he interceded several weeks ago is because the organizing principle of the nation's foreign policy is the protection of the homeland. %$* 138
9/11 was the second bloodiest day in american history, exceeded by only one other day, september 17th, 1862, when more americans were killed in a single afternoon in the battle of antietam, than any other day. %$* 138
that is the organizing principle. %$* 138
that's why public opinion, frankly, has become risk ready, not because we believe, or the president believes, that he is somehow going to put the iraqi and syrian humpty dumpty back together again. %$* 138
all right, then go to bret stephens. %$* 13
he can't. %$* 138
bret stephens. %$* 13
look, i mean, we're all happier in this room, i suspect, as new yorkers, that osama bin laden is dead. %$* 141
what did it require to kill him? %$* 141
it wasn't smart diplomacy. %$* 141

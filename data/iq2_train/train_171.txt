one is unemployed and always has been unemployed, always been on government care. %$* 18
one of them is a-- %$* 18
let's say, somebody who's in jail. %$* 18
and then a third person is someone who has actually been in the system paying taxes and everything else. %$* 18
they get in a car accident, same thing happens. %$* 18
do all three deserve, from government care, the same result? %$* 18
which side would you like to hear answer that question? %$* 13
over here. %$* 18
did you follow it? %$* 13
if you didn't follow it, i want to say, "neither did i." %$* 13
okay, good. %$* 469
well, i didn't. %$* 469
i didn't. %$* 469
it was a lot for me to follow. %$* 13
can you simplify-- %$* 13
you know, turn it into a principle rather than a scenario? %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
thanks. %$* 13
three people-- %$* 18
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
does everybody, regardless of their status and stature in life, deserve exactly the same care when the government is what is going to pay for that care? %$* 18
what a great question. %$* 13
ken connor. %$* 13
well, in america, we've historically said that we're entitled to equal protection under the law. %$* 468
and so the government, arguably, has an obligation to treat everyone the same. %$* 468
now, in the marketplace, it doesn't always work that way. %$* 468
we talk about equal opportunity, not equal outcomes. %$* 468
and so that's what i like about the marketplace, is that decisions can be made in the marketplace. %$* 468
look, the notion that government is more qualified to make decision and to allocate resources than markets, i think, is a foolish notion. %$* 468
the history of the world suggests otherwise. %$* 468
the soviet union imploded on itself because its central managers were not efficient, but in the final analysis, i think we need to understand that the constitution is a hedge against government. %$* 468
it's not a hedge against individuals. %$* 468
it's not a hedge against the markets. %$* 468
bu the constitution limits the powers of government. %$* 468
so if government is going to assume certain responsibilities, it's bound by the chains of the constitution, and i think we want it that way. %$* 468
can i make a quick point? %$* 469
there's another question. %$* 13
your question was, "does everybody deserve the same level of care, regardless of who they are? %$* 13
" and are you talking about extraordinary measures at the end-of-life care, which may need to be rationed because of scarcity of resources? %$* 13
that's what this debate's about. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so your question-- %$* 13
but i think sally pipes said in her opening statement, each of us should have the right to live as long as we can. %$* 13
right. %$* 469
and these people are 72, you said, or 71.they're obviously on medicare, because they're seniors. %$* 469
and i think i'd like to ask art, when someone turns up at an emergency room, they're on medicare, do you ask, "are you an ex-prisoner, or are you unemployed? %$* 469
" i think there's a responsibility in the emergency room to treat these people. %$* 469
and most doctors i know who are er doctors have no idea whether the person is wealthy or poor or whatever. %$* 469
so i think that under medicare they should be treated by art or whomever, in the equal way. %$* 469
no, but they were in the hospital for six months. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
so, over the course of six months. %$* 18
well, that's a new-- %$* 469
you've added something new to your scenario. %$* 469
i'm going to move on, and not as a sign of disrespect, but just as a sign of the clock running. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thanks for understanding. %$* 13
i want to get a couple more questions. %$* 13
sir, right in the middle? %$* 13
my name is ganesh ramani %$* 18
can you-- %$* 13
the mic wasn't on; sorry. %$* 13
my name is ganesh ramani. %$* 18
my question is really for both parties, but i think more so for the side against the motion, because the side for the motion, i think, has more or less answered the question. %$* 18
but the question is, is there a scenario or situation under which you would consider rationing end-of-life care? %$* 18
well, look, i think we're all in agreement that rationing is a de facto matter. %$* 468
rationing occurs. %$* 468
the question is, who should ration? %$* 468
and is government in a better position than others to ration? %$* 468
but you've made that before, but, so, to his specific question, the answer is yes, there are situations-- %$* 13
the answer is yes, and i favor rationing through markets and individuals rather than through government. %$* 468
okay. %$* 13
does the other side want to respond to that .okay. %$* 13
ma'am? %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i'm going to take two more questions, then, if it's a serious question. %$* 13
just let the gentleman go first because that-- %$* 13
because that's who has the microphone. %$* 13
and then we'll-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
yes. %$* 13
so for scarce resources, i view that there's kind of two types: one is hospitals and doctors, and the other is government capital and government money to spend. %$* 18
so i view them as kind of differently when i think of rationing end-of-life care. %$* 18
and so i'm kind of-- %$* 18
first in terms of from this side, i believe i kind of heard that you're in favor of rationing, you know, government spending, while not rationing hospitals and doctors for those who want to pay for it. %$* 18
i'm kind of-- %$* 18
so first i want to know, is that kind of correct? %$* 18
and then also for this side, do you view that, why shouldn't somebody be responsible to save up their money or pay for private insurance so that they can pay for that end-of-life care while the government can ration the government spending but not ration the doctors and the hospitals? %$* 18
i want to take your question as an opportunity to bring up another key point which we spent a lot of time tonight talking about economics, and we spent a little time talking about the uninsured and the underinsured. %$* 466
but there's another group that really suffers under the current system. %$* 466
and those are the folks who are lining the hallways and in trauma centers and ers waiting for the icu bed that they can't get into and are there for two or three days. %$* 466
the ambulances are diverted from a trauma center to a non trauma center because all the beds are full. %$* 466
we are not a country of unlimited money or of unlimited critical care capacity. %$* 466
and so my perspective, and i think my colleague's perspective, is given that we live in a finite world, we want to do the most good for the most people possible. %$* 466
and that should be our fundamental mission. %$* 466
you can call that rationing, you can call it rational use of resources. %$* 466
but every life has worth. %$* 466
and the fact that somebody got there first shouldn't be ultimately the prevailing decision. %$* 466
we've got to maximize the benefit and the value and the system to society-- %$* 466
what's the system then, art? %$* 13
then what's the system that-- %$* 13
the system is, again, you have to make decisions. %$* 466
you work with families. %$* 466
you have to figure out where-- %$* 466
but if it's-- %$* 13
does medicare get to set up a panel to say we're going to provide this particular procedure or not because it's evidence-based medicine suggests it's not cost effective. %$* 13
does medicare get to say we're not going to do that? %$* 13
i think medicare gets to say we're not going to pay for it. %$* 466
that's what i mean. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 466
i think if you say you're not going to pay for it, people will go, "ah, never mind." i mean, we know that. %$* 466
the rand grant has done work for 40 years that showed that if people have to put their money on the table, they tend to make more careful decisions. %$* 466
and that's just human nature. %$* 466
do you want to respond to that, ken or sally? %$* 13
i would, yes. %$* 468
i mean, i-- %$* 468
ken connor. %$* 13
you've made a very good point that i think is a very important point, and that is that when we don't have skin in the game, we're less likely to be good stewards of the resources available to us. %$* 468
and so for instance i think one way that we can promote having skin in the game in the responsible consumption of medical resources is to allow young people, for instance, to have health savings accounts with high deductible insurance policies. %$* 468
and they've got skin in the game. %$* 468
let the government subsidize or provide tax breaks to individuals who purchase health insurance, not just to businesses. %$* 468
the way the current system is set up is that we tend to over consume the resources because we don't have any skin in the game. %$* 468
the employer is paying the bill. %$* 468
the government subsidizes the employer, and there's no skin off our nose. %$* 468
and so if we want to promote good stewardship, good stewardship, then i think we ought to-- %$* 468
ought to cause people to have skin in the game. %$* 468
and that would mean that they have a stake in their own healthcare decisions. %$* 468
if they do, they're less likely to over consume resources than they otherwise would be. %$* 468
and that's a very good point: consumer-driven healthcare, health savings accounts have shown that the cost of care is down because people do have skin in the game. %$* 469
and in fact, art, rand corporation came out with a study on hsas for small businesses showing that that is a way to reduce costs for small business employers. %$* 469
and i think that it was-- %$* 469
they were really good results about 13 1/2 million people in this country have hsas combined with a high deductible plan because if you have employer based coverage it is what ken said, first dollar coverage. %$* 469
people have no idea what the doctor visit costs, they go more often. %$* 469
consumer-driven healthcare is a terrific solution. %$* 469
okay. %$* 13
ma'am, i owe you an apology. %$* 13
if this were the oscars, the music would be playing. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i have to-- %$* 13
i have to stop because this concludes-- %$* 13
because this concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
and if you'll remember, before the arguments began, we asked all of you to vote on this motion. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again after you hear the closing remarks. %$* 13
this is their last chance to try to ease your mind. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
they are two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this: ration end-of-life care. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position against this motion, sally pipes, president and chief executive officer of the pacific research institute. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 469
and you know by now i am against the proposition that end-of-life care should be rationed. %$* 469
the medicare trustees have projected that the program medicare will be bankrupt by 2024 at a cost of $1 trillion, almost double the costs today. %$* 469
one of the ways to reduce the costs of our medicare programs is to deny end-of-life care. %$* 469
i believe it's morally wrong, but the position is supported by my opponent. %$* 469
there are 50 million seniors in this country today on medicare. %$* 469
and that number is going to expand exponentially as the baby boomers retire. %$* 469
and i am one of the baby boomers. %$* 469
doctors are already feeling the financial squeeze. %$* 469
they are reimbursed by government at a rate 20 percent below what they get for treating private patients. %$* 469
it is no wonder that 52 percent of doctors surveyed say they're limiting the access of medicare patients to their practices. %$* 469
unless reformed, this could result actually in bureaucrats setting an age limit for one's life. %$* 469
in order to save medicare for those who truly need it, changes are necessary, including premium support, mean testing and raising the eligibility age from 65. %$* 469
former house speaker nancy pelosi who represents my district, “if the changes suggested by romney and ryan are implemented, seniors will die in the streets.” well, i believe if we don't make these changes, based on the medicare cuts seniors will die in the streets. %$* 469
they won't be able to get doctors or the care they need. %$* 469
don berwick when he was administrator at cmms said, "it's not a question of whether we're rationing care or not. %$* 469
will we ration it with our eyes open? %$* 469
" we do not want a nice system in this country. %$* 469
it's not the american way where a government body determines what is cost effective rather than medically effective. %$* 469
america needs a healthcare system where doctors and patients make decisions about the best kind of care that is needed when their loved ones approach the end of their lives. %$* 469
morally and ethically, this is the only way to proceed. %$* 469
i urge you to vote against rationing the end-of-life care. %$* 469
thank you very much for listening. %$* 469
thank you, sally pipes. %$* 13
and now in support of the motion, peter singer. %$* 13
he is professor of bioethics in the university center for human values at princeton university. %$* 13
we've actually reached a surprising amount of agreement in this debate because both sides agree that rationing occurs. %$* 467
sally said there's always going to be rationing. %$* 467
ken said we are all in agreement that rationing occurs. %$* 467
the question is he went on to say, is who should ration? %$* 467
he says he favors rationing through markets rather than government. %$* 467
but you should read that article that he wrote that i mentioned before on the website about the problems of the elderly because his approach from that article, all-profits nursing homes have on average 32 percent fewer nurses and 47 percent higher deficiencies than their nonprofit counterparts. %$* 467
this increased emphasis on profits has led to a distressing rise in neglected end of use seniors. %$* 467
so i have to ask, why does ken have such confidence in the market, solving the problem of the allocation of medical resources, when he is broadly, i believe, critical of what all-profits nursing homes do to abuse seniors. %$* 467
we think that there has to be a better way than allowing profit maximization to determine how we are cared for. %$* 467
let me just conclude by referring to the case that sally began with, the sad case of her mother, and say that although that is a tragic case, obviously we cannot generalize from a sample of one. %$* 467
i spent most of my life living under single-payer systems, either in australia or in the united kingdom. %$* 467
i or rather my wife, had two of our children in the united kingdom and one of them in australia. %$* 467
i think that the quality of care that we have received in australia has been outstanding. %$* 467
i've obviously had medical care in this country. %$* 467
i don't think that it's better than it is in australia. %$* 467
and i don't think that it's even more a respectful of individual choice because australians can insure themselves in addition to medicare. %$* 467
peter singer your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 467
and here to summarize his position against the motion, ken connor. %$* 13
he is founder and chairman of the center for a just society. %$* 13
one of our founding fathers said, "if men were angels then we wouldn’t need government." men are not angels and we do. %$* 468
markets are not perfect. %$* 468
and they do need regulation. %$* 468
the question is "where do we wind up striking the balance? %$* 468
" and i can tell you to peter’s point that care in our nursing homes in america is america's dirty secret. %$* 468
and it's in part because a-- %$* 468
real estate investors pose as health care providers. %$* 468
and the government doesn't adequately regulate them, plain and simple. %$* 468
and we have a absolute scourge of preventable bedsores, and avoidable malnutrition, and dehydration, falls, and avoidable infections. %$* 468
but let me say this, i think it's important to understand that rationing is not required in order for the health care system to remain solvent. %$* 468
that assumes the fallacy of only one alternative, that either we ration or we're going to go broke. %$* 468
that's not true. %$* 468
and that's why i brought up the point earlier in the debate, which dr. %$* 468
kellermann didn't seem to understand, that there are lots of places from which we can effect savings. %$* 468
but it's work to effect these savings. %$* 468
it's hard work to wrest resources from the hands of the special interests. %$* 468
we should not ration. %$* 468
we should not balance the budget on the back of the sick and the dying. %$* 468
we can provide good health care for all people through and including the end of life. %$* 468
we need to ask good questions. %$* 468
we need to ask, "are the procedures necessary? %$* 468
are they clinically indicated? %$* 468
is the cost reasonable? %$* 468
" what we need is a rational approach to end-of-life health care, not the rationing of end-of-life health care. %$* 468
thank you. %$* 468
thank you, ken connor. %$* 13
and, finally, in support of the motion, arthur kellermann. %$* 13
he is the paul o'neill alcoa chair in policy analysis at the rand corporation. %$* 13
most western democracies have health care systems that provide you with all the care you need, whether or not you can afford it. %$* 466
our health care system has evolved to provide you with all the health care you can afford, whether or not you need it. %$* 466
modern american medicine is a $2.8 trillion a year industry, and it is rapidly outgrowing our economy's capacity to support it. %$* 466
more high tech care is not necessarily better care. %$* 466
sometimes the basics, pain control, bedside attention, love, matter a lot more than the most sophisticated $100,000 medicines there are. %$* 466
that's why, when terminally ill patients came into my er, i did not immediately incubate, immediately start multiple ivs, immediately do anything i didn't absolutely have to do. %$* 466
i stabilized the patient the best i could, i assessed the situation, and i talked to the patient. %$* 466
if they were able to communicate or not, i would bring the proxy-- %$* 466
the son, the daughter of, a brother, the spouse to the bedside. %$* 466
let me tell you what happened one night as an example. %$* 466
i brought a daughter who had cared for her mother for 10 years to the bedside, and i said, "your mom has severe pneumonia. %$* 466
she's septic. %$* 466
this is the third time she's been in the hospital in the last two months. %$* 466
we can do everything we know to do, and she will almost certainly die, but she might pull through. %$* 466
and the best we can hope for is she'll be the way she was a week ago when she didn't recognize you and was in the nursing home. %$* 466
so my question to you is not 'what do you want us to do? %$* 466
' i know what you want us to do. %$* 466
you want us to make your mother the way she used to be. %$* 466
i can't do that. %$* 466
so i want to ask you, 'what would your mother want if she came back now and stood next to you? %$* 466
'" and she said, "mama would say, 'it's time.'" as you vote tonight, i ask you to consider what kind of doctor do you want to take care of your mother, and what kind of doctor will you want to take care of you, and that should guide your vote. %$* 466
thank you, art kellermann. %$* 13
we're going to have the second vote now. %$* 13
so if you go to the keypads in your seat. %$* 13
after hearing everything, we want to know where you stand, whether you have been persuaded to one side or the other. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, "ration end-of-life care," the side argued by this team, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion, with this team, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys. %$* 13
and they will lock in pretty quickly, actually. %$* 13
we'll have the vote probably in about a minute and 45 seconds. %$* 13
and so, while we're waiting, a few things that i want to say. %$* 13
first of all, ma'am, if we're lucky enough to be invited back next year, you find me at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
i owe you the first question. %$* 13
okay? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and everybody else who stood up and asked questions, including the ones that we didn't get to use, it takes a lot of guts to stand up, and a lot of the questions were great, actually. %$* 13
i want to thank all of you for doing that. %$* 13
i also want to thank, despite what i would professionally consider a little bit of meandering in the middle, i think we got into some very important places in this debate where the clash was head-on. %$* 13
we could see the values represented by both of these sides, because he doesn't actually have to think in real time. %$* 13
that's a very impressive thing to see happen. %$* 13
it's difficult to do. %$* 13
i want to thank this panel for what they've brought here to this stage. %$* 13
it's really been a pleasure to be part of chicago ideas week and to be in the city at all. %$* 13
you actually are a very, very lively audience, and you're going to sound great on the radio. %$* 13
afterwards, after the debate, we would be delighted, of course, to have you tweet about the debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us, and the hashtag is the same, #iq2us. %$* 13
i want to thank the ciw team, in particular i want to name some people. %$* 13
brad keywell, carrie kennedy, and jessica malkin who, again, was very instrumental in getting us on this stage. %$* 13
our next debate is wednesday, october 24th. %$* 13
it will be held in new york city. %$* 13
and the motion in this date is, "the rich are taxed enough." in support of the motion, we have glen hubbard, is currently dean of the columbia business school. %$* 13
he is also an economic advisor to presidential candidate mitt romney. %$* 13
his partner is art laffer, who is known as the father of supply side economics, the famous laffer curve is his curve. %$* 13
he was a member of president reagan's economic policy advisory board. %$* 13
he's debated with us before, and he's actually very-- %$* 13
not only smart, he's very witty. %$* 13
he keeps everybody laughing. %$* 13
against this motion, "the rich are taxed enough," we have robert reich, who is former secretary of labor in the clinton administration and professor at the university of california in berkeley, and mark zandi, who is one of the most widely followed economic forecasters and the chief economist of moody's analytics. %$* 13
so, all right. %$* 13
the results are being walked up. %$* 13
so, remember, we had you vote-- %$* 13
this never happens in new york. %$* 13
that was very generous. %$* 13
our motion is, "ration end- of-life care." we now have the results in on your votes. %$* 13
remember, we had you vote before you heard the argument and once again after hearing the arguments, and the team who has changed your numbers the most, who has moved you to their side by the largest percentage, will be declared our winners. %$* 13
so here is how it breaks out. %$* 13
before the debate, 43 percent were for the motion, 22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 38 percent are for the motion-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
after the debate, 81 percent are for the motion, up 38 percent; 12 percent are against it, down 10 percent; 7 percent are undecided. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion carries the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from, me, john donvan, in chicago, and intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

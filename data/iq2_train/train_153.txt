they have to do with interest rates which are too low. %$* 436
credit was too cheap. %$* 436
people get overleveraged. %$* 436
they have to do with overconfidence. %$* 436
people basically are overconfident. %$* 436
we know this from more and more studies of how people make economic decisions. %$* 436
so the first point is we should just-- %$* 436
we shouldn't debate the cause of the crisis in terms of a particular piece of legislation or a particular institution. %$* 436
we should go and look at history. %$* 436
and-- %$* 436
laura, how does your point relate against our motion? %$* 13
my point is about the bailout. %$* 436
my point is about right now we are looking at the size of government at a crisis moment that we have not lived through before, anyone in this room, that occasionally societies go through, that when that happens, governments tend to increase in size. %$* 436
they double, they triple. %$* 436
the government debt as a share of gdp rises by 85 percent. %$* 436
there are huge mop-up operations. %$* 436
and to say a bailout, why did the government step in? %$* 436
you know, frankly, it was not for tears for lehman brothers or bear stearns or any of the banks that received federal money. %$* 436
it was because credit markets had closed down. %$* 436
it is because money market funds were about to go under. %$* 436
it was because things that you relied upon as you put your money in the money market, and it was worth-- %$* 436
put in $500, when you went, there was $500. there wasn't going to be $500. %$* 436
so this was a bailout of the financial system. %$* 436
there was a run on the financial system. %$* 436
capitalist economies cannot run without finance. %$* 436
there was no solution-- %$* 436
so you're saying it was time for the government to act. %$* 13
i'm saying the government had to act. %$* 436
it had to get bigger. %$* 436
we can debate the cause, but we may as well deal with the reality. %$* 436
that was the reality. %$* 436
i have a-- %$* 13
question in the second row. %$* 13
go to a question here. %$* 13
and if you could stand, please, and remember with the microphone. %$* 13
i think it's very interesting that this debate has really revolved around whether tax cuts should happen in the fall or not. %$* 19
but i actually think you really missed the whole question. %$* 19
and that is where should investment whether-- %$* 19
regardless of the size of the government, what areas should our government or-- %$* 19
actually invest in directly or incentivize, whether it's science, technology, is it education, is it oil, is it energy? %$* 19
this is what we're not talking about. %$* 19
if the american spirit is defined as innovation and creativity, you guys haven't discussed it, none of you. %$* 19
so i'm very curious as to what your top three investments would be and how it would happen? %$* 19
can i-- %$* 436
can i say that i thought-- %$* 436
laura, i want to let phil gramm because, see, you had a run. %$* 13
well, first of all, it is hard for me to see government as a driver of creativity and innovation. %$* 435
it is generally an impeder of those things. %$* 435
it's just not true. %$* 436
now look. %$* 435
there are always areas of government you could do more in. %$* 435
everybody talks about education. %$* 435
we have dramatically increased spending in education, and quality has fallen because we let education be dominated by a monopoly, the teacher's union. %$* 435
so we need to make some dramatic reforms. %$* 435
but look, here is the problem, and i agree with laura, we do have a special circumstance. %$* 435
we have a crisis. %$* 435
but when you're looking at the debt burden that we're piling up now, that's not going to go away when the crisis goes away, the problem with saying let's do this later-- %$* 435
phil, i have to interrupt because i thought this question was one that everybody was going to hear the answer to. %$* 13
her question is what areas would you invest in. %$* 13
what would be the three areas where you put direct investment? %$* 13
through government. %$* 435
through government. %$* 13
well, first of all, i think the best investment government can make is to put its financial house in order so that we can have a functioning private system so that we can have more private investment and more job creation. %$* 435
so the first thing i'd invest in is deficit reduction. %$* 435
the second thing that i would invest in is science. %$* 435
science-- %$* 435
basic science, not taking an idea and commercializing it, something government knows absolutely nothing about, and where every day somewhere in the world we see some huge program where the japanese invested in high definition television, invested huge amounts of money, and it ended up the market went the other direction, it was all lost. %$* 435
so basic science, basic knowledge, basic ability to do things-- %$* 435
not just to cure people quicker and better, but to do it cheaper. %$* 435
we have virtually no investment in healthcare in economy. %$* 435
if i bought groceries the way i buy healthcare, where somebody else pays 95 cents out of every dollar, i'd eat different, and so would my dog. %$* 435
and that-- %$* 435
okay, so-- %$* 13
that's the problem in healthcare. %$* 435
so you've got two answers to your question. %$* 13
i want to see if laura tyson has another. %$* 13
i just feel like i need to repeat, and maybe i have indeed failed as a debater-- %$* 436
if you're repeating too much, i'll stop you. %$* 13
my comment in my opening statement was precisely that. %$* 436
i identified exactly where i thought the government should invest. %$* 436
the government used to spend much more on basic science and research. %$* 436
it used to spend much more on infrastructure. %$* 436
those are areas. %$* 436
and it used-- %$* 436
and it must spend much more on higher education. %$* 436
this is not-- %$* 436
federal government doesn't spend much on k through 12.higher education. %$* 436
so i look at the research. %$* 436
90 percent of the growth in labor productivity, which is the driving force of how productive the nation is and what we can afford to pay ourselves, 90 percent comes from investments in those three areas, higher education, research and science, and infrastructure, and the u.s.government used to spend 69 percent of its budget on it, and now it only spends 32 percent. %$* 436
and what is squeezing that out? %$* 436
what's squeezing that out is entitlements and interest on the debt, because we are unwilling to pay for the things we need to pay for. %$* 436
so that's the tradeoff, yes, the u.s.government is not investing enough in your future, in our future. %$* 436
but it's very clear where it should be making those investments. %$* 436
there's a gentleman in an orange jacket, and if you could come around, i'll come to you as the next question, i just wanted to ask you to get into a position for that. %$* 13
and the woman-- %$* 13
yes, you just did if you could rise, the mic will come up to you. %$* 13
and again, short questions are working very well tonight. %$* 13
yes, we-- %$* 19
tonight we heard a lot about this "irresponsible bush tax cut,” quite a bit from nouriel and laura. %$* 19
i just wanted to hear what they think about the recent one trillion dollar entitlement packages the obama administration just passed at the depth of the crisis. %$* 19
and i would think that is a perfect example of big government stifling the american spirit, and i would like to hear what they think about that. %$* 19
why do you think it's a-- %$* 13
let me ask her for clarification, please-- %$* 13
why do you think that that's an example? %$* 13
because i think it changed people's expectation about the government's role in the society. %$* 19
taking much more role and must be much more invasive, and also basically increased people's expectation that it takes-- %$* 19
taxes are bound to go up. %$* 19
okay, thank you. %$* 13
laura tyson. %$* 13
i just need a clarification. %$* 436
the one trillion dollars-- %$* 436
are you referring to healthcare reform? %$* 436
okay, so what we know about this is that again the nonpartisan congressional budget office has basically determined that that package if put in place will actually reduce the deficit. %$* 436
it will reduce the deficit. %$* 436
now-- %$* 436
all right. %$* 436
the reason you don't-- %$* 436
no. %$* 436
the reason you don't believe that if you're laughing-- %$* 436
the reason you don't believe that if you're laughing is because you don't believe that healthcare costs in the united states in the private sector are going to slow down, because the only way, the only way we can get control over the federal government's healthcare spending, which is now more than half of all healthcare spending in the united states, is if private healthcare costs slow down. %$* 436
remember, we're spending three times as much as any other advanced industrial country. %$* 436
there are lots of other models out there. %$* 436
they're not all socialized medicine. %$* 436
we are doing a lousy job in the healthcare sector. %$* 436
sir, can you come down into the-- %$* 13
where the lights-- %$* 13
we'll be able to see you? %$* 13
about five more steps. %$* 13
so i think that the one trillion dollars has basically been credited as something that will pay for itself if we get healthcare costs down. %$* 436
and if you laugh it's because you don't think that will happen to our society, and then we're not going to be better off. %$* 436
sir. %$* 13
as a lonely citizen-- %$* 18
can you bring the mic and start again closer? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
that's great, thanks. %$* 13
as just one citizen, is it fair that i have a right to keep more of what i earn or should i be required to give more? %$* 18
yeah. %$* 18
well, that's red meat to you guys %$* 13
well, first of all-- %$* 435
enjoy. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 435
i'll come back to you. %$* 13
that we define freedom far too narrowly. %$* 435
the question we've been asked is a question about freedom. %$* 435
to what degree should the people be able to keep what they earn? %$* 435
to what degree does a person own and therefore have the right to keep the product of the sweat of their brow? %$* 435
i was always amazed when i was in government at all of the empathy that went to people who were riding in the wagon that were benefiting from government, but no empathy for people that were pulling the wagon. %$* 435
on welfare you can get $17,500 of benefits per child, and under the federal tax code, if you work for a living, you get $1,000 tax credit per child. %$* 435
shouldn't we give people pulling the wagon the same benefits we give people riding in the wagon? %$* 435
this is going to be the end of this section, so it's time for your flourish. %$* 436
end of this section-- %$* 436
this is not the two-minute %$* 436
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
but your response is going to conclude our second round-- %$* 13
the one point we haven't raised tonight because we've talked a lot about taxing the rich and we've talked a lot about the past, so i think it's important to know that the last time the income distribution was as unequal in the united states as it was in 2008 was 1928.that the share of income going to the top one percent the top 0.01 percent is larger than it’s ever been in our country and we need to just think about that. %$* 436
now that goes to the issue and i ended a comment i made before about we need to also think about the fact that now about a quarter of our children live in poverty. %$* 436
this is about the kind of society one wants. %$* 436
it’s not actually about freedom or lack of freedom. %$* 436
it’s about what kind of society one wants. %$* 436
and i think that if you take the idea if you own your own self, the sort of logical conclusion of that is that nobody makes any contribution to the common good unless they feel like it, unless they feel like it. %$* 436
so that means we’d have no justice department. %$* 436
we’d have no defense. %$* 436
we’d have no education. %$* 436
it would basically be what’s mine is mine and i’m going back to my house and taking it with me. %$* 436
i don’t think that is the notion of what most americans think is the fair society they want to live in. %$* 436
thank you, laura tyson and that concludes round two of our debate and here we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statement from each debater. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each and it’s their last chance to change your minds and after they speak you’re going to be asked to vote once again and to pick the winner, just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
but first, round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit,” and here to make her closing statement against this motion, laura tyson, a professor at the haas school of business at berkeley and a member of president obama’s economic recovery advisory board. %$* 13
well i think to a certain extent you’ve heard part of my closing statement. %$* 436
i will just reiterate my main points. %$* 436
i think that citizens look to government to do things. %$* 436
right now the government has been forced to do more than it normally does because of the crisis. %$* 436
i believe the government will get smaller once the crisis-- %$* 436
we’ve gotten through the crisis but i think it’s important to do that. %$* 436
i think it is important for the government to invest in our future and i’ve made that clear how the government should do that. %$* 436
i’ve noted that we haven’t talked at all tonight about, amazingly enough, defense. %$* 436
defense. %$* 436
if we really want to make the u.s. government smaller, do we really want to spend 20 percent of the government’s budget on defense and 43 percent of the world’s spending on weapons? %$* 436
do we really want-- %$* 436
do we think that’s fair? %$* 436
and finally i would say that i do think that we need to, as a society, ask ourselves the question about what kinds of benefits we want, what are we willing to pay for. %$* 436
because what has happened in the starving the beast mentality is we actually have made the tax base smaller. %$* 436
we don’t tax even at the levels of the clinton administration, but we’ve made the government bigger. %$* 436
you know, not only did we fight two wars without financing them under president george w.bush, but we also passed the medicare prescription drug benefit program. %$* 436
that was more than a trillion dollars. %$* 436
no funding. %$* 436
none. %$* 436
the cbo said that would cost a trillion dollars with no funding. %$* 436
the cbo in the trillion-dollar bill that was just passed said it paid for itself. %$* 436
so where was the big entitlement with no funding? %$* 436
it came under george w.bush. %$* 436
my point is if we want that kind of benefit, we’d better be serious about how to pay for it because right now, our government is not that big. %$* 436
it’s not that big. %$* 436
of gdp but we’re funding it-- %$* 436
laura tyson, your time is up and thank you very much. %$* 13
help from the rest of the world. %$* 436
we don’t want to do that. %$* 436
thank you, laura tyson. %$* 13
our motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit” and here to summarize his position for this motion is phil gramm, a former senator and chairman of the banking committee, currently vice-chairman at ubs investment bank. %$* 13
i believe that government is stifling the american spirit and i believe that we’ve reached a crisis point. %$* 435
when we look ten years into the future and we see government taking almost half of all income taxes simply to pay interest on the debt, this is a future that i don’t want for america. %$* 435
now we can avoid this future but we can’t avoid it by waiting for somebody else to fix this problem. %$* 435
we can’t avoid it by taking a poll. %$* 435
we’ve got to have leadership. %$* 435
we’ve got to explain to america what is at stake. %$* 435
and i don’t want to dwell on the past. %$* 435
i was asked about the past versus the future but the past is the only thing we know about the future. %$* 435
when ronald reagan became president, people sensed that we had a crisis. %$* 435
we had wasted ten years of economic growth with stagnation, double digit inflation, high unemployment. %$* 435
and we had to make hard decisions. %$* 435
america made those decisions because they believed there was a crisis. %$* 435
i believe there's a crisis today. %$* 435
and more importantly, i believe that americans believe it. %$* 435
but what they're waiting on is leadership to show them the alternative. %$* 435
it's just like at the end with the medical analogy, you get sick, you go to the doctor. %$* 435
the options he gives you are often not very palatable, especially if you're very sick. %$* 435
but you do it because you believe that you will get better if you do those things. %$* 435
i believe americans can show courage and can show sacrifice if they believe that america will be benefited in the end. %$* 435
and that's what this crisis is about. %$* 435
phil gramm, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
the motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit.” and here to summarize his position against the motion, nouriel roubini, a professor at new york university stern school of business and chairman of roubini global economics. %$* 13
is american spirit stifled because of big government? %$* 163
not at all, because tax revenues today are the lowest level they have been in the last 50 years. %$* 163
15 percent of gdp.it used to be an average of 20.in europe, they're around 40, 50 percent. %$* 163
so the problem is not with too much taxes. %$* 163
is the american spirit stifled because we have a mental recession today? %$* 163
no. %$* 163
we have the worst economic and financial crisis, recession and depression, we've had in the last few decades. %$* 163
and why do we have it? %$* 163
because we tried twice in the ’80s and again in the last decade an experiment in voodoo economics. %$* 163
every time they're in power, they pretend that they want to starve the beast, but increase-- %$* 163
instead recklessly reduce tax rates in a way that's unsustainable. %$* 163
they increase massively discretionary spending and military spending. %$* 163
and then because economic and financial crisis, and then they leave a trillion dollar budget deficit to the next administration. %$* 163
it's just a train wreck for somebody else to take care of it. %$* 163
it happened during the bush-reagan years of the 1980s. %$* 163
and it took clinton to raise taxes and reduce the budget deficit and turn it into a surplus. %$* 163
it happened again with the bush tax cuts of the last decade that led to the worst economic and financial crisis since the great depression. %$* 163
every time they talk, they blame everything on big government. %$* 163
but the true agenda is different. %$* 163
every time they pass reckless and unsustainable tax cuts, mostly for the rich, they privatize in good times, that gains them the profits. %$* 163
and after they cause a massive economic and financial crisis, they socialize all the losses and bail out wall street. %$* 163
they privatize the gains. %$* 163
they socialize the losses. %$* 163
they don't believe in capitalism. %$* 163
they don't believe in small government. %$* 163
they don't believe in the american spirit. %$* 163
they believe in big government, socialist and welfare for the rich, the well connected and for wall street. %$* 163
that's what they do. %$* 163
thank you, nouriel roubini. %$* 13
the motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit.” and our final speaker to summarize his position in support of this motion, arthur laffer, chairman of laffer associates and a former economic advisor to president reagan. %$* 13
if i can just start off by looking at the issue at hand here today, is big government stifling the american spirit? %$* 15
i think that at least three if not all four of us agree that that is the case. %$* 15
i mean, i look at nouriel roubini, what he's been saying, and it's been exactly what we've been saying. %$* 15
laura has been talking about the defense budgets and all of that. %$* 15
that is big government. %$* 15
should we be in iraq? %$* 15
should we be in afghanistan? %$* 15
that's a big government intervention, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. %$* 15
should we socialize all the-- %$* 15
no, but i-- %$* 15
hold that. %$* 15
should we socialize all the losses for these companies? %$* 15
absolutely not. %$* 15
but you can't have a profit and loss system without losses. %$* 15
for people who overborrowed on their income, for banks that were undercapitalized, if they made a play, and it's wrong, let them lose. %$* 15
just let it go and let the system work and go. %$* 15
government is way too big. %$* 15
should we invest in a flat rate tax where the government's not meddling in every single person? %$* 15
yes, we should. %$* 15
we should do all of that. %$* 15
government is way too big, and it is stifling the american spirit as these two and the two of us all agree. %$* 15
if i can-- %$* 15
you know, i think phil gramm, a little story is the correct story. %$* 15
i think his facts are great, but i think you can't have more people sitting in the wagon than you have pulling it. %$* 15
i used to tell my students that if i ran this class like your government runs your country, what i'd do is i'd flunk all the a students out, and i'd give all the f students scholarships. %$* 15
so before you laugh, think about it for a second before you laugh. %$* 15
my a students are a little bit smarter than my f students. %$* 15
so once i changed the rules, my a students are able to get lower grades than my f students because they don't randomly make the mistake of ever guessing a correct answer. %$* 15
the distribution of grades is unchanged, period. %$* 15
there's not one change. %$* 15
but what have i done? %$* 15
i've destroyed the entire quality of the educational process. %$* 15
you cannot change the distribution of income with taxes. %$* 15
but you can change the volume. %$* 15
government is too big, and it's stifling the american spirit, as we all agree up here. %$* 15
thank you. %$* 15
thank you, art laffer. %$* 13
and that concludes our opening statements. %$* 13
and now-- %$* 13
now it is time to learn which side has argued best, because you in our audience will make that decision. %$* 13
we are asking you again to push the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we'll get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
you were asked to vote when you came in, to tell us where you stand on the motion. %$* 13
we're asking you again. %$* 13
and the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is big government is stifling the american spirit. %$* 13
press one if you are for the motion, two if you are against, and three if you are undecided. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in just a minute. %$* 13
so while that's being tabulated, the first thing i want to do is i want to thank all the questioners and the folks who stood up and gave their opinions. %$* 13
the questions were terrific, sometime a little tricky to get the questions answered, but i think we worked that out. %$* 13
so thank you to all of you for your questions. %$* 13
tell me again. %$* 13
oh, i made a mistake in a line-- %$* 13
just now when the debate ended, and i wanted to say that concludes our closing statements, i said that concludes our opening statements, which was a mistake because it was at the wrong end. %$* 13
and it would help me a great deal if you could do one more round of applause, and i'll get the line right. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
no, but i need this to be so spontaneous. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side of the argument fell. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you to all of you. %$* 13
and i also want to thank our panel. %$* 13
you know, when it suddenly dawned on me that we had four phd economists, i kind of thought, oh boy. %$* 13
but no, this was robust and engaged and spirited. %$* 13
and i thank all of you for really bringing your a games to this. %$* 13
so before we announce the votes which are being tabulated, a few things that i want to talk about coming up for us. %$* 13
our next debate will be very soon. %$* 13
wednesday, november 10th, the motion is “afghanistan is a lost cause.” panelists for the motion are matthew hoh. %$* 13
he's a former state department official. %$* 13
he resigned in protest over u.s.strategic policy in afghanistan. %$* 13
also, his partner will be nir rosen, a freelance journalist and author of aftermath, following the bloodshed of america's wars in the muslim world. %$* 13
against the motion, we'll have peter bergen, who he is the gentleman who filmed osama bin laden's first television interview for cnn 13 years ago. %$* 13
and his debating partner will be max boot, a council on foreign relations military historian and a foreign policy analyst and the author of a fascinating book which i have read, called war made new. %$* 13

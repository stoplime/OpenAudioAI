so let's begin now by welcoming to the stage, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
good evening, john. %$* 1
so, bob, we've done debates on gun control issues before. %$* 13
we did a debate where the motion was guns reduce crime. %$* 13
we're visiting it again, but we're phrasing it specifically a different way. %$* 13
why is that? %$* 13
well, let me start by just sort of saying what this debate is and isn't. %$* 1
it's not about whether the second amendment should be repealed. %$* 1
that's just a political impossibility. %$* 1
and it's not about whether the second amendment gives us an individual right to bear arms. %$* 1
the supreme court has decided that. %$* 1
so this is more of a debate about the historical context of the amendment itself and whether it has outlived its usefulness. %$* 1
and the team that's arguing for the motion, in terms of putting it in historical context and reflecting changing times, in fact, i'm assuming that's what they're going to be arguing. %$* 13
well, the world was very, very different when this amendment was passed. %$* 1
it was a world in which state militias were relevant. %$* 1
it was a world in which there were no professional police forces so that the only kind of defense against violence was self- defense, and it was a world in which it was plausible to think that an armed citizenry was a bulwark against tyranny. %$* 1
we had just been through the revolutionary war, after all. %$* 1
and in what ways has the world changed that might make that irrelevant now? %$* 13
well, those who see the amendment as rooted in an historic anachronism are going to feel like we should have the most restrictions we can against gun ownership that the constitution would permit. %$* 1
the other side is going to say no, this is not a historic anomaly at all. %$* 1
this amendment enshrines the ability of americans to defend their security at home, and 47 percent of all americans do have guns at home and see it as essential to their-- %$* 1
the security of themselves and of their families and those people feel very strongly that this is an amendment that embodies values, such as self-reliance, such as independence, and such as kind of collective responsibility for public order that the founders embraced and which they embrace, too, and which are relevant to this day. %$* 1
and our four debaters have really-- %$* 13
some of them have been living this topic for a long time and, as you'll learn, they've been ground-- %$* 13
they've provided some of the groundbreaking thought between-- %$* 13
behind how some of this has actually been argued in the courts. %$* 13
they've actually been players in this debate for some time. %$* 13
so, bob, thank you very much for bringing this and bringing them to the stage, and let's welcome them to the stage now. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i just want to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for doing this for us. %$* 13
this is intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan, and sometimes a regular ordinary guy gets to have his name go down in history in a very big way, and it happened to a guy named dick heller, who happened to be working in security in a government building in washington, d.c., when he sued the government of washington, d.c., over a law that prevented him from legally owning a handgun. %$* 13
and it went all the way to the supreme court and dick heller won. %$* 13
it was district of columbia versus heller and it was the landmark gun rights case of all time where the supreme court ruled only in 2008 that the constitution guaranteed to every american a personal right to bear arms. %$* 13
and if it is that obvious, then perhaps people who aren't happy with how that has turned out might want to argue that perhaps that right never should have been put into the constitution in the first place. %$* 13
and what a debate that would be, as we are about to find out. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufmann music center in new york. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two against two. %$* 13
americans all, but they're divided on this motion: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds. %$* 13
and then our live audience in new york city votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, again, is the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion, trying to convince you that the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
let's welcome, first, ladies and gentlemen, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
alan, you're a professor at harvard law school. %$* 13
you've played parts in these cases. %$* 13
the pentagon papers, bush v. %$* 13
gore, the wikileaks investigations, the defense of oj simpson. %$* 13
we have heard about those cases. %$* 13
but on the back cover of your recent memoir-- %$* 13
you just came out with a memoir called "taking the stand," you quote noam chomsky, who says, "dershowitz is not very bright and strongly opposed to civil liberties." and you quote him. %$* 13
so you've given the whole thing away to the other side here? %$* 13
well, my high school teachers said the same thing. %$* 305
and so-- %$* 305
i think you guys have to give me a little break. %$* 305
these guys are all smarter than i am, so there %$* 305
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
give him a break. %$* 13
and alan, your partner in this debate is? %$* 13
my partner in this debate is the very, very distinguished professor, sandy levinson, who's just written his own great book. %$* 305
ladies and gentlemen, sandy levinson. %$* 13
great book is called "framed: america's 51 constitutions and the crisis of governance." he's a professor of law at the university of texas and a professor of government, there, too. %$* 13
in 1989, sandy, you wrote an article in the yale law journal that is really credited with reshaping the entire debate over gun rights in this country, which was not much of a debate up to that point. %$* 13
so this whole thing is your fault? %$* 13
well, if i get an obituary in the new york times, when the time comes, no doubt that article will be the lead. %$* 432
well, i hope you're not thinking about that right now. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome sandy levinson. %$* 13
our motion is the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and here to convince you to vote against this motion-- %$* 13
i want to introduce, ladies and gentlemen, david kopel. %$* 13
and david, you're research director at the independence institute, co-author of the first law school textbook on the second amendment. %$* 13
and in the case of district of columbia v. %$* 13
heller, the landmark supreme court gun rights case, you were a member of the oral argument team. %$* 13
you are also a member of the nra. you are also a member of the aclu. how do you put dinner parties together? %$* 13
the trick is you make the pre-dinner prayer optional and that makes the aclu folks happy. %$* 433
and then you have a lot of sharp knives around, and the nra people are content. %$* 433
all right. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
david kopel, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and david, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the genial genius, eugene volokh, perhaps the most important first amendment scholar in the united states today. %$* 433
ladies and gentlemen, eugene volokh. %$* 13
eugene, you're a professor of law at ucla. the reason that you were just referred to as a genius is that according to the tuscaloosa news profile done in 1981, when you were 12 years old and you were a sophomore at ucla, the newspaper reported that your iq was 206. and you recoiled earlier when i told you i was going to bring that up, so i thought maybe we could talk about your credit score instead. %$* 13
on a good day it's better than that. %$* 434
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome eugene volokh and all of our debaters. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest of ideas. %$* 13
and our motion is the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and by the time this debate has ended, we will have asked you, our live audience in new york, to vote twice on this debate, because you will be the judges of the winners. %$* 13
before the debate, we will ask you to vote before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go to the keypads at your seat and we'll be getting on to round 1 in just a moment. %$* 13
let's go to these keypads at your seat and we'll have you vote your position as you come in off the street. %$* 13
the motion is the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion at this motion at this point we want you to push number one, and if you disagree, push number two, and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and we're going to lock this out in just a minute and just to repeat this, at the end of the debate, same thing. %$* 13
we have you vote another time and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage points from this starting point will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round one. %$* 13
opening statements by each debater uninterrupted. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
the motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness, and here to persuade you to vote for this motion, let's welcome sanford levinson, ladies and gentleman. %$* 13
you're a professor of law, as well as professor of government at the university of texas, austin. %$* 13
so, ladies and gentleman, let's welcome arguing for the motion, sanford levinson. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 432
i want to begin by repeating a point that bob rosenkranz made. %$* 432
this is not a debate about policy. %$* 432
as it happens, i can't completely speak for my colleague, professor dershowitz, but i would very much oppose, for example, a federal law banning guns independent of the second amendment, because it is very, very clear that there is a critical mass of americans who would be vehemently opposed to that. %$* 432
it would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like, there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced. %$* 432
most enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, i think, in that capacity. %$* 432
it's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed that i have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds, but fortunately we're not here to debate that. %$* 432
nor do i think we are here to debate the one true meaning of the second amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about which indeed i have written. %$* 432
rather, i want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us, the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 432
now, one reason i relish this statement of the question is that i'm one of those relatively rare people, i will admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because i believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness. %$* 432
i wouldn't even say that the second amendment or the right to bear arms is the one that has most outlived its usefulness, but i'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013 the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the second amendment in the bill of rights, which bob rosenkranz summarized, i think, very well, have outlived their usefulness. %$* 432
so, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantive rights, as well as what structures the senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like? %$* 432
would it include a substantive right in the united states constitution to bear arms? %$* 432
and i would argue that the answer is no. %$* 432
let me also emphasize that this is a different question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms. %$* 432
eugene has written one of the definitive articles showing, i don't know what the current number is, but i think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the united states constitution as well. %$* 432
let me give you two principle reasons why a constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners. %$* 432
so, let me give you the two reasons why i think the second amendment has outlived its usefulness in the 21st century. %$* 432
the first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal. %$* 432
that is to say, one of the anomalies-- %$* 432
sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a scorecard-- %$* 432
in the debate about gun rights. %$* 432
there are many people who define themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that believes in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems. %$* 432
well, this is not necessarily what heller decides, but it is what the supreme court decided two years later in the mcdonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line. %$* 432
louis brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation. %$* 432
most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. %$* 432
there are some states-- %$* 432
or cities-- %$* 432
very dense cities, like washington, d.c., that would prefer different experiments. %$* 432
or in new york itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great cities of new york and a very different policy for upstate new york, where there are far, far more hunters than is the case in manhattan, say. %$* 432
and one of the things that a single national constitutional amendment-- %$* 432
as interpreted by the supreme court-- %$* 432
does is to stifle that kind of federalism. %$* 432
and i think that's a mistake. %$* 432
but there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the 21st century. %$* 432
as mr. %$* 432
rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms-- %$* 432
or the second amendment-- %$* 432
had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008.it's not that people didn't write about it. %$* 432
i wrote about it. %$* 432
eugene wrote about it. %$* 432
a number of people found it very interesting. %$* 432
but it played remarkably little role in actual american law. %$* 432
beginning with heller, it does play a role. %$* 432
but what does that mean? %$* 432
it means that you turn over decision-making power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable-- %$* 432
even unreasoned-- %$* 432
distinctions. %$* 432
thus, for example, in heller, justice scalia says that dick heller is protected, which i think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that martha stewart is not, because she actually lied to an fbi agent and is thus a convicted felon. %$* 432
i don't think judges should be making those kinds of decisions. %$* 432
i think legislators should. %$* 432
thank you, sandy levinson. %$* 13
our motion is the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
and now here to try to persuade you to vote against this motion-- %$* 13
let's welcome eugene volokh. %$* 13
he is the gary t.schwartz professor law at ucla and founder and co-founder of the volokh conspiracy, one of the most widely read legal blogs in the country. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, eugene volokh. %$* 13
all right. %$* 434
thank you very much for having me here. %$* 434
and it's such a great pleasure to be on the same panel with david, and alan, and sandy. %$* 434
they're all top scholars and i also reckon all of them as friends of mine. %$* 434
and so let me start with something i think we all agree on, on the panel. %$* 434
and i think probably virtually everybody-- %$* 434
perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, and that is that there's a basic human right to self-defense. %$* 434
and there are, of course, debates about the particular boundaries of that right. %$* 434
but there's a core to that right that every state in the union recognizes. %$* 434
i'm sure it's well-recognized outside the u.s.as well. %$* 434
if somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape, kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself if that is necessary. %$* 434
that is very broadly agreed on. %$* 434
and i think it's agreed on because it is a basic human right. %$* 434
so i think there's little difference about that. %$* 434
but then there's the question-- %$* 434
what does that right entail? %$* 434
and i want to argue that a right to self-defense, like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that are necessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself. %$* 434
let's take an example. %$* 434
the right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether you want to have children or not. %$* 434
imagine somebody says oh sure, i'm all for that right, you can use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method. %$* 434
we wouldn't say that's a serious argument. %$* 434
we'd say it's a parody of an argument, right? %$* 434
we'd say well of course, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools that are reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that. %$* 434
that's not just for that right, it's also for speech. %$* 434
your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it's the right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonably necessary to effectively defend yourself. %$* 434
and guns are reasonably are necessary to effectively defend yourself. %$* 434
our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defend ourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, and even if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficiently ruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with a gun, often not by shooting it. %$* 434
the overwhelming majority of all defensive gun users involve just threatening to use it. %$* 434
just a couple of thought experiments. %$* 434
i'm sure some of you live in places-- %$* 434
in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol. %$* 434
i suspect few of you live in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol. %$* 434
i would be willing to bet that. %$* 434
so in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armed guards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled to essentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves. %$* 434
the right to bear arms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone. %$* 434
if they are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allows people to do. %$* 434
and i think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutions specifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's an individual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism. %$* 434
this dates back from the pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the kansas constitution in i think 2012, and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well. %$* 434
now, some people may say well okay, fine. %$* 434
it's reasonable to say there's a presumption in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be rebuttable. %$* 434
if there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there may be, well, then we should do that. %$* 434
well, interesting argument, but there is no such evidence. %$* 434
so, in 2004, the national research council appointed a committee of scholars, of criminologists. %$* 434
they put out this very nice report. %$* 434
you can read it for free online. %$* 434
the consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer. %$* 434
centers for disease control in 2005, similar study, similar result. %$* 434
the other studies as well from new york's own new york university: james jacobs, looks at can gun control work. %$* 434
his answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what we know. %$* 434
now, of course, sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions, but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges? %$* 434
well, one reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level, questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process. %$* 434
we have set them up as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this question as to whether this makes sense. %$* 434
well, i think the answer to that you have to think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country given the political realities. %$* 434
and so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want? %$* 434
if you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want? %$* 434
now, if what you want-- %$* 434
so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size of large capacity magazines. %$* 434
you have to decide what is it that you want. %$* 434
now, if you want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the second amendment, even if you can persuade people the second amendment has outlived its usefulness. %$* 434
there are going to be lots of people you won't persuade. %$* 434
there are 300 million guns in the country. %$* 434
they're not just going away. %$* 434
criminals will have access to them, and as sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will become criminals because they will insist on retaining them. %$* 434
aha, people say well, but that's not what we want, right? %$* 434
we want modest gun controls, that's what i always hear. %$* 434
probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun controls the second amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way. %$* 434
courts have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges. %$* 434
there's a wide range of modest gun controls. %$* 434
to be sure, there's federal level in many states, though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal constraint. %$* 434
the second amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control-- %$* 434
some people think it should be. %$* 434
but as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't likely to be. %$* 434
but what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the second amendment is your friend. %$* 434
and any attempt to repeal it-- %$* 434
that is what your enemy would be. %$* 434
because all of those people who have been assured, "oh, i'm not going to take away your guns. %$* 434
oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you're just paranoid"-- %$* 434
if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the second amendment, which i think is the implication of the conclusion that it's outlived its usefulness would be, that would turn that all-- %$* 434
make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that's what's going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns. %$* 434
so if you want modest gun controls-- %$* 434
i'm not saying you should-- %$* 434
but if you do, you should be arguing that the second amendment has not outlived its usefulness. %$* 434
part of its usefulness-- %$* 434
besides self-defense-- %$* 434
is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president-- %$* 434
have ensured them.-- %$* 434
thank you-- %$* 13
have ensured them.-- %$* 434
eugene. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters arguing it out over this motion, in two teams of two: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
we have heard two of the debaters. %$* 13
and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's welcome to the lectern alan dershowitz. %$* 13
he is the felix frankfurter professor of law-- %$* 13
at harvard, the bestselling author of 30 books, including "taking the stand: my life and the law." alan dershowitz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 305
what a great and powerful argument. %$* 305
no wonder he is considered a genius. %$* 305
but let's think about his argument for a minute. %$* 305
the argument was really not so much in favor of the second amendment. %$* 305
it was in favor of the right of self-defense. %$* 305
you are right. %$* 305
we all agree. %$* 305
there should be a right of self-defense. %$* 305
so don't you agree with me that it would have been better if the second amendment had been written as "everybody has the right of self-defense"-- %$* 305
then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions. %$* 305
you would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting, because hunting is not part of self-defense. %$* 305
the second amendment reads rather differently. %$* 305
it starts out by saying "a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state," then “the right of the people to bear and keep arms.” so, i think everybody would agree that the first clause of the second amendment, "well-regulated militia," has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
we do not have militias, state militias. %$* 305
they are as anachronistic as the third amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops. %$* 305
now, that doesn't mean that i would want to amend the bill of rights. %$* 305
i don't want to amend the third amendment. %$* 305
i prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the third amendment, sandy will have a constitutional convention. %$* 305
and he'll have people who might start amending the first amendment, and the fourth amendment, and the fifth amendment. %$* 305
so i'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the second amendment, like the third amendment, has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
my point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the constitution, the right of self-defense. %$* 305
then we would have nothing to debate. %$* 305
we would all agree there is a right to self-defense. %$* 305
we would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the fourth amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places. %$* 305
but we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right. %$* 305
the primary right should be the right of self-defense. %$* 305
of course i throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the second amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's home or oneself? %$* 305
should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense? %$* 305
would you rewrite the second amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term "a well- regulated militia," and say, instead, "the right of self-defense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed." it seems to me, from professor volokh's argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the constitution, he would have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being essential. %$* 305
so i think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating-- %$* 305
a new basic fundamental right-- %$* 305
and then deriving the right that's in the constitution from that fundamental right. %$* 305
and so, the question remains, what difference would it make? %$* 305
the difference is fundamental. %$* 305
i agree with you. %$* 305
basic rights should be recognized by constitutions. %$* 305
virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense. %$* 305
four countries in the world, mexico, guatemala, haiti, and the united states, i think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms. %$* 305
it seems to me that that's a relevant consideration, and i agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate. %$* 305
and we should not federalize this constitutional right. %$* 305
we should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms. %$* 305
what do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common? %$* 305
what does mexico, guatemala, haiti, and the united states have in common? %$* 305
they all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates. %$* 305
i don't want to get into the argument because i agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways. %$* 305
you can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way. %$* 305
look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home. %$* 305
it cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates. %$* 305
that just can't be a coincidence. %$* 305
there are cultural differences. %$* 305
to be sure, japan is not the united states, england is not the united states, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and i know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions, but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in? %$* 305
do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns? %$* 305
i’m reminded of the great episode from "all in the family" where archie bunker gets to do an op-ed on television. %$* 305
and he says, "the way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking is very simple. %$* 305
require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun. %$* 305
that way nobody will hijack an airplane." do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a gun? %$* 305
and do you want to live in an america where everyone has a gun? %$* 305
if the answer to that question is no, let's acknowledge that the 2nd amendment is anachronistic, has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
let's not abolish or amend the 2nd amendment, let's construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self- defense, perhaps-- %$* 305
here i'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns. %$* 305
that's my position. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 305
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
our motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness, and here to argue against this motion, david kopel. %$* 13
he is research director at the independence institute, an adjunct professor at denver university stern college of law, and associate policy analyst at the cato institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, please welcome david kopel. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 433
thank you. %$* 433
when i'm not in new york city, i spend just about all my waking hours in one particular case in a civil rights lawsuit in federal district court in colorado where i represent 55 of colorado's elected sheriffs who are suing against the unconstitutional extreme and highly immodest laws pushed down on colorado by mr. %$* 433
bloomberg's successful lobbying last spring. %$* 433
in the united states supreme court i presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement organizations in district of columbia versus heller and mcdonald versus chicago. %$* 433
included in that coalition are the two organizations-- %$* 433
national organizations of police trainers, the police who train the police. %$* 433
my clients, like the vast majority of law enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done, strongly support the second amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in the right hands substantially enhance public safety. %$* 433
what's some of the evidence for this belief? %$* 433
well, in the united states, when a burglary takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home. %$* 433
it's called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary. %$* 433
in contrast, in england, the rate of home invasion burglaries is 59 percent. %$* 433
in the netherlands, it's 45 percent. %$* 433
and this is because, in the united states, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in their home and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in those other nations. %$* 433
studies of working burglars in pennsylvania, massachusetts, connecticut, and st. %$* 433
louis have consistently found that burglars-- %$* 433
most burglars in the united states work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do come in when somebody is home. %$* 433
and in fact, in the united states, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that he will go to prison. %$* 433
and if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary-- %$* 433
and i certainly do-- %$* 433
then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value. %$* 433
the centers for disease control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization. %$* 433
they conducted a national survey in 1994.they found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive gun uses against burglars. %$* 433
usually, without-- %$* 433
in the united states. %$* 433
usually without a shot even being fired. %$* 433
and in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early. %$* 433
now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home. %$* 433
if you simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45 percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million assaults every year in this country. %$* 433
that, by itself, would raise the national crime rate by nine percent. %$* 433
guns are not only useful against burglars and for deterring burglars, but for self-defense in general. %$* 433
this summer the national research council and the institute of medicine-- %$* 433
two federal research centers-- %$* 433
at the request of president obama, put together an expert panel of the leading social scientists on firearms policy issues to provide recommendations for what future topics need to be researched, and also, on what topics has consensus been achieved among social scientists. %$* 433
what they said in their report was that the social science is clear, that when a victim is attacked, using a firearm defensively leads to a lower rate of victim injury, to a lower rate of crime completion than any other protective strategy. %$* 433
it is the safest thing to do for the crime victim on a broadly-- %$* 433
broad-scaled statistical basis. %$* 433
and they also said the social science is clear, that guns are used at least for good, lawful, defensive purposes-- %$* 433
at least as often as they are used for criminal purposes. %$* 433
of course the benefit to law enforcement of this is enormous, in the fewer victimizations; the fewer crimes, the fewer people they have to respond to and help so they can help other people. %$* 433
now, why is the second amendment necessary today? %$* 433
to protect people from local, bigoted governments. %$* 433
it was necessary in the civil rights era, when civil rights workers frequently had to arm themselves in the south for protection against the domestic terrorist organization known at the ku klux klan, when local police were often complicit with the klan. %$* 433
it's why the deacons for defense and justice were formed in bogaloosa louisiana in 1965, to successfully provide armed protection to organizations such as the congress of racial equality. %$* 433
it was necessary in washington, d.c., where dick heller spent every day as an armed guard at the federal judicial center and was not allowed by the d.c.city council to use any firearm in his home, ever, for lawful self-defense against a violent home invader. %$* 433
it was necessary in chicago, where otis mcdonald, a 70-year-old korean war veteran received personal death threats from gangsters because of his anti-gang work. %$* 433
and chicago said, "well, you can have a rifle or a shotgun." he knew how to use a rifle. %$* 433
he had been in the korean war, but for his condition in the apartment he lived in with his physical strength and agility and the current status it was, the handgun was the right choice for him for self-defense, and the bigoted city council of chicago would not allow him to use that, and that's why the second amendment was necessary, and it's necessary in new york city right now. %$* 433
if you have a handgun permit in new york city, you can go on a trip. %$* 433
you can drive from brooklyn all the way to seattle and lawfully carry that gun in your car in every state across the country and it's a good secure thing to have in case your car breaks down in the middle of the night someplace on a deserted road. %$* 433
but the new york city police department won't let you take the handgun out of the city. %$* 433
there is no rational basis for that prohibition. %$* 433
it is purely for the oppression of gun owners to the detriment of self-defense. %$* 433
it is a dangerous law and a second amendment lawsuit will likely be necessary to remove that. %$* 433
i urge you to vote against this deadly dangerous proposition to vote for public safety based on the recognition that today the second amendment remains vitally necessary to the security of a free state. %$* 433
thank you. %$* 433
thank you, david kopel. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening. %$* 13
again, we are going to have you vote right after the arguments are concluded and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round two and round two is where the debaters address one another and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
we have two teams of two. %$* 13
the motion is: the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
the team that's arguing for this motion that it's outlived its usefulness, sandy levinson and alan dershowitz. %$* 13
we have heard them argue that number one they're telling you that they're not here arguing to ban all guns, they're not here arguing to repeal the second amendment, but they are arguing that the right to bear arms has no place in the constitution, that this should be left up to local governments and to states, that judges shouldn't be involved in making these policy decisions. %$* 13
they also are making the argument that the language as written really doesn't talk about a right to self-defense, that the right to bear arms is not the same thing as a right to self-defense, and if we want a right to self-defense, let's put it in the constitution, but right now it's just not there. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, david kopel and eugene volokh are trying to get you to vote against this motion that the right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. %$* 13
they say the right to self-defense is a basic human right and so is access to the tools needed to carry out and execute that right. %$* 13
they say clearly that they believe that guns do deliver that self-defense and went through several examples of that, but they also say that it needs to be in the constitution, because there's a bigotry at the local level against gun ownership and it needs the protection of a constitutional amendment much in the same way as civil rights have in the past. %$* 13
so that's where the two sides stand on this basically. %$* 13
and i want to go to the side that's arguing against the motion, trying to convince this audience that the constitutional right to bear arms remains vital, has usefulness, and to bring to you something that your opponent, alan dershowitz, said, in which he said sure, you guys are arguing the right to self-defense. %$* 13
they concede that's a basic human right, but they also insist it's just not there in the language of the second amendment. %$* 13
it says right to bear arms, not the right to self-defense, and they say that's a difference. %$* 13
which of you would like to take that on? %$* 13
real quick. %$* 433
the second amendment is the right to keep and bear arms. %$* 433
as heller and mcdonald say, it's the right to keep and bear arms for all lawful purposes, self-defense, hunting, target shooting, whatever. %$* 433
it's not limited to self-defense. %$* 433
certainly self-defense is the most important purpose of that right under heller. %$* 433
that's what the supreme court said was the core purpose of the right, but the supreme court didn't say that was the only purpose of the right. %$* 433
the right is for all lawful purposes and modern constitutions, state constitutions say so more explicitly, but their point is the same as the second amendment. %$* 433
okay, so alan dershowitz, i think your opponent david kopel is saying it's pretty obvious that's what everybody means by the right to bear arms. %$* 13
not at all. %$* 305
i think the second amendment historically gives the right of the people the right to use guns against their government. %$* 305
as jefferson said over and over again, we need to have armed citizens in the state to make sure that there are no monarchies trying to take over. %$* 305
it was a right of revolution. %$* 305
there was no debate, as far as i know, about self-defense. %$* 305
it may have been implicit, but the second amendment's language and many of the people who are the strongest supporters of the second amendment are literalists. %$* 305
they go to the original understanding. %$* 305
they look at the words-- %$* 305
why are you prepared to excise the first, whatever it is-- %$* 305
10 words from the constitution? %$* 305
"a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state"-- %$* 305
are you prepared to concede that a well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state? %$* 305
uh, no. %$* 18
david kopel. %$* 13
you want to-- %$* 18
david volokh. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
no. %$* 434
eugene volokh. %$* 13
no, i want neither. %$* 434
i want neither. %$* 434
so the-- %$* 434
i think, on this point, the court was quite right that if you look at the way the word "militia" was understood around the time of the framing-- %$* 434
and actually remains a legal definition of the term, although not a common lay definition-- %$* 434
militia meant the armed, adult-- %$* 434
at the time-- %$* 434
male citizenry, the times being what they were. %$* 434
and "well-regulated" meant basically well-functioning, well-trained. %$* 434
so, really, what they were saying is an armed, well-functioning citizenry-- %$* 434
well-functioning as a body that knows how to use its weapons-- %$* 434
is necessary to the security of a free state. %$* 434
and that because of that, because-- %$* 434
and this is a preamble that explains the rationale or part of the rationale for the right-- %$* 434
because of that, the government shouldn't be able to disarm the people. %$* 434
but-- %$* 434
now there's-- %$* 13
was point to defend the state or to defend your own home? %$* 13
the point was both. %$* 434
and that is one of the things that the court, i think, correctly %$* 434
here-- %$* 433
alan, here's what you're overlooking. %$* 433
if you-- %$* 433
david kopel. %$* 13
read things like stephen halbrook's, "the founders' second amendment" and the other intellectual sources, very clearly they understood self-defense against a lone criminal and self-defense against a tyrannical government as the same thing, except the latter was larger in scale. %$* 433
it's all self-defense, all the way up, all the way down. %$* 433
so, what does "well-regulated" mean? %$* 305
what you're trying to do is now say that everybody who owns an individual gun has to be a part of a regulated militia. %$* 305
they have to come to the green every day and march and-- %$* 305
well, but they're not-- %$* 13
they're-- %$* 13
but they're not saying that, alan. %$* 13
they're not saying that. %$* 13
no. %$* 18
they're saying-- %$* 13
i think what you're saying-- %$* 13
and i'm not taking sides, but i just want to bring clarity to-- %$* 13
i think that's a straw dog. %$* 13
i think they're saying that implicit in the fact that the-- %$* 13
if there were a militia, that the guys have the guns in the house, and they could also defend their house. %$* 13
and they need to have them to use them, whether their purpose was a militia or not. %$* 13
but we don't have a well-regulated militia now. %$* 305
we don't have any kind of militia now. %$* 305
so i think you're conceding that the first part of the amendment has outlived its usefulness. %$* 305
we win at least the first half of the debate, right? %$* 305
david kopel. %$* 13
and i'd like you to respond to what he just said. %$* 13
sure. %$* 433
thomas cooley, the great constitutional scholar of the latter 19th century, addressed your exact point. %$* 433
and he said that the interpretation you're following would defeat the purpose of the second amendment, because that would mean the government, by neglecting the militia, could thereby destroy the right to arms. %$* 433
we might have more public safety if there were something to encourage more regulated, well-trained citizen defense patrols, for example, in communities. %$* 433
but that's up to the government-- %$* 433
like the ku klux-- %$* 305
wait-- %$* 433
like the ku klux klan? %$* 305
well, we can't force them to do that. %$* 433
let me bring in sandy. %$* 13
but this government's neglect does not destroy the underlying right. %$* 433
sandy levinson. %$* 13
i want to return to this issue of the-- %$* 13
of the absence of an explicit right to self-defense in the constitution. %$* 13
you want to-- %$* 13
you would love to draw up the constitution all over again. %$* 13

so, let's now please welcome to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi bob. %$* 13
good evening, john. %$* 1
so, amazon's been around now 21 years or so, and we're getting to this debate now. %$* 13
what's-- %$* 13
give us a sense of what's at stake in this one. %$* 13
well, it's more current than you might think. %$* 1
i was reading an op-ed in the wall street journal yesterday. %$* 1
and the headline was about an economics textbook, one of the most popular ones that kids are required to buy. %$* 1
you know what the publisher's price is, $360. %$* 1
wow. %$* 13
and-- %$* 1
must be a really good book. %$* 13
i glanced through it. %$* 1
most of it's wrong. %$* 1
but that said, you can buy it on amazon for a discount, pay $292, or you can rent it for a semester from amazon for $24, so i'd say in that case i think amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 1
i mean, if it's put in pricing terms, it does seem that amazon is the reader's friend, that it's obvious, that there is no debate in that sense. %$* 13
so, what it-- %$* 13
what is there to debate about on this? %$* 13
well, i think this debate is sort of about first and second order effects. %$* 1
right now it feels fine to be a reader to have the choice and-- %$* 1
that amazon offers. %$* 1
but we're in a process where ultimately amazon has a lot of power, and it affects authors, it affects writers, it affects publishers, and ultimately maybe affects readers in a way that's not obvious right at the moment. %$* 1
but amazon has power also in appliances, and they're putting pressure on the appliance store business. %$* 13
why focus on books and reading? %$* 13
well, because books are so important to our culture. %$* 1
i mean, they represent our intellectual life, our creative life, our cultural continuity. %$* 1
it's just-- %$* 1
it's very different from other kinds of commodities, and frankly the people who write books and are interested in books are a lot more articulate than the people who make appliances for a living. %$* 1
so, books are not widgets. %$* 13
they are not. %$* 1
all right, well, we've got some-- %$* 13
i don't want to say, "widget makers"-- %$* 13
we've got some writers coming to the stage tonight. %$* 13
all of our debaters are writers. %$* 13
they're passionate about this but very, very divided. %$* 13
let's thank bob rosenkranz and welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
welcome. %$* 13
throughout the evening, because we ultimately turn this debate into a podcast and a radio broadcast, i have to take various breaks. %$* 13
but i don't really take a break. %$* 13
i don't go anywhere. %$* 13
i say, "we'll be right back," and you'll notice that i'm still here. %$* 13
so, i want to explain that i'll be doing that and that a number of times i'll say things over and over again like, "my name is john donvan." it's not because i forgot. %$* 13
it's because we're coming back from a radio break. %$* 13
and when those moments come, it would be wonderful if i could sort of subtly prompt you to a moment of spontaneous applause-- %$* 13
such as this, if you could do that. %$* 13
that'll help us begin. %$* 13
welcome to intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
and, wow, that gutenberg guy, 1455, he churns out a bible with moveable type. %$* 13
and how would that be described if it were today? %$* 13
well, we would say that gutenberg was really rocking the religious content space with a platform of innovation and disruption, putting the whole god brand in front of a whole lot more sticky eyeballs for scripture. %$* 13
pardon my buzzwords, please. %$* 13
but now comes amazon and is that perhaps as historic, one-click shopping, ebooks. %$* 13
disruptive? %$* 13
amazon could very well drive traditional publishers and brick and mortar bookstores completely out of the book space. %$* 13
and is that a good thing or a bad thing? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "amazon is the reader’s friend," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters. %$* 13
they are all writers and book lovers, but they are deeply divided on this issue and are arguing two against two over amazon being the reader's friend. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage joe konrath. %$* 13
joe, you are an author known for your bestselling thrillers. %$* 13
you are also one of the leaders and biggest advocates in the field of self-publishing. %$* 13
you did the traditional book publishing route but your real success, and that means millions of books that you've sold, came after you decided to self-publish with amazon. %$* 13
how did readers find you? %$* 13
well, i hope they find me entertaining. %$* 375
i hope we'll find you entertaining as well tonight. %$* 13
joe konrath, who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is the wonderful, the drop-dead sexy editor at vox, matthew yglesias. %$* 375
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome matthew yglesias. %$* 13
matthew is also arguing for the motion that amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
you are, as just mentioned, executive director-- %$* 13
executive editor at vox.com. %$* 13
you write a lot about economics and business and politics. %$* 13
you wrote a book called, "the rent is too damn high," and you come from a family of writers, novelists, in fact. %$* 13
your father, your grandparents, your brother. %$* 13
are they on your side in this debate? %$* 13
well, my father happens to be here live, so i'd like to think he's voting strategically and sort of rigging the grade in my favor. %$* 376
all right. %$* 13
well, we're going to have to check on his vote later on, but let's welcome this team to the stage arguing for the motion. %$* 13
but we have two writers arguing against the motion amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
first please let's welcome franklin foer. %$* 13
author of a book about globalization called "how soccer explains the world" and until recently editor of the new republic. %$* 13
that's a different debate we'll have another time. %$* 13
in the october issue of the new republic you actually wrote that cover story and the title you gave that cover story happens to sum up a lot of your feelings about this debate topic. %$* 13
can you tell the audience what that title was? %$* 13
it might be a touch obtuse for my opponents, but it was called "amazon must be stopped." %$* 377
subtle. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
well, he's the author of "presumed innocent," and tonight you should presume him correct, scott turow. %$* 377
ladies and gentlemen, scott turow. %$* 13
scott turow, you are also arguing against the motion that amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
you're past president of the authors guild and, as mentioned, written a lot of best sellers a lot of us have heard of, and not just because they turned into movies, but a lot of them have. %$* 13
you have been criticizing amazon in the past, particularly in its 2014 struggle with hachette publishing. %$* 13
hachette, you worked for-- %$* 13
hachette through grand central publishing has published your books. %$* 13
we just want to get that out there. %$* 13
but all of this - - does this mean that you are not a member of amazon prime? %$* 13
no. %$* 378
i am a member of amazon prime. %$* 378
but i refuse to buy anything from amazon during the course of the hachette/amazon brouhaha and for many years now and it continues. %$* 378
i refuse to buy books from amazon. %$* 378
point of principle? %$* 13
i would call it patriotism. %$* 378
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, scott turow and the team arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
that amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
now this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be one team winning and one team losing and that decision is made by our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the winning team is that whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms between the first vote and the second vote. %$* 13
so, let's lodge in that first vote. %$* 13
let's register that first vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat you'll see that there's numbers one through zero. %$* 13
that makes no sense. %$* 13
one through nine and zero and you only have to pay attention to one, two, and three. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion push number one. %$* 13
if you're with this side, push number one, the side that's arguing that amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
if you're against push number two, and if you're undecided push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore those other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you made the wrong choice, pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and again, i'll say this one more time and a few more times, it's the team whose numbers have changed the most between now and the end of the debate when you vote the second time that will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's move on to round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this: amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
and here to argue first in support of this motion matt yglesias. %$* 13
he is executive editor of vox.com. %$* 13
he is the author of the book "the rent is too damn high." ladies and gentlemen, matt yglesias. %$* 13
amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 376
in the long-term obviously readers are only going to thrive in a world where author's also thrive and i suspect we're going to spend a lot of time eventually talking about the impact, the long-run impact of amazon on authors and authorship. %$* 376
and my partner is going to be able to speak to a lot of that in a great deal of detail, more depth than i possibly can. %$* 376
but i write about economics. %$* 376
i'm a pretty literal person. %$* 376
so, i’m going to keep it a little bit on the surface level-- %$* 376
amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 376
and i think you can see that amazon is the reader's friend, by just asking, why are we debating this at all? %$* 376
why is this a subject of controversy? %$* 376
it's a subject of controversy because amazon is really big. %$* 376
it's a big company. %$* 376
it's a powerful company. %$* 376
they have 41 percent of all books sold-- %$* 376
i saw a statistic from last march-- %$* 376
and 67 percent of all digital books. %$* 376
that's big. %$* 376
that's a big power player. %$* 376
it's worth talking about. %$* 376
and it naturally raises the question, you know, how did the company get so big. %$* 376
how did they have so much market share? %$* 376
why are they so dominant? %$* 376
my argument is, they're so dominant in this space because they're the reader's friend. %$* 376
who buys books? %$* 376
it's readers. %$* 376
amazon sells books to the vast majority of readers because it's good for readers. %$* 376
another argument-- %$* 376
you know, frank has written that amazon is some kind of a monopoly, some kind of an abusive force that's dominating the marketplace, maybe through nefarious means, something like that. %$* 376
some strategy other than being a reader's friend. %$* 376
and i think that that's just not true, this idea that amazon must be stopped by some kind of external force. %$* 376
it doesn't hold up, because the fact of the matter is even though amazon has an extremely large share of the market, it faces a ton of competition. %$* 376
i don't know about you guys, but i'm the owner of an iphone. %$* 376
i bet a lot of people in the audience may be-- %$* 376
may be iphone users. %$* 376
yes? %$* 376
no? %$* 376
yes. %$* 376
yes? %$* 376
maybe-- %$* 376
maybe some of you have a google, an android phone, something like that, yeah? %$* 376
yeah. %$* 376
so, some people have smartphones. %$* 376
it turns out these phones, they're directed-- %$* 376
they're connected directly to digital stores. %$* 376
you can go on ibooks on your iphone. %$* 376
you can go to the google play store on your android. %$* 376
and you can find “how soccer explains the world.” you can find-- %$* 376
frank edited a book called "jewish jocks" that i've been meaning to check out since i was in a debate in san francisco with his co- editor. %$* 376
and i actually-- %$* 376
i picked it up on my phone on the train. %$* 376
you can find-- %$* 376
i'm not sure if it's every scott turow novel, but a great deal of them. %$* 376
they're there in the google store. %$* 376
they're there in the apple store. %$* 376
these are companies that are competing with amazon. %$* 376
and they're not, like-- %$* 376
these are not small, weak, pathetic, helpless companies, right? %$* 376
they're actually bigger than amazon. %$* 376
amazon is not going to drive apple out of business. %$* 376
they're not going to drive google out of business. %$* 376
what they are doing is beating them badly in the electronic book space. %$* 376
they're selling way more books than those companies. %$* 376
so, how is it that they're doing that? %$* 376
did they do something sneaky? %$* 376
no. %$* 376
they have a better product, right? %$* 376
you can get apple, google on your phone. %$* 376
you get them on your tablet. %$* 376
but it's amazon who invested in creating the kindle, which is a digital device that's really meant for reading, you know? %$* 376
i like to read books sometimes on my ipad. %$* 376
it's fun. %$* 376
but my wife, she's got a kindle paperwhite, and she loves it. %$* 376
and i've been known to borrow it, because it-- %$* 376
it really is a better device for reading books on than what these other companies do. %$* 376
they've also got a superior piece of software. %$* 376
if you download a kindle book, you can read it on your kindle, but you can also use the kindle app on an iphone, on an android tablet. %$* 376
you can read it on the web. %$* 376
apple and google, they both want to make more exclusive, more locked-down platforms that don't give you as much flexibility. %$* 376
and that's fine. %$* 376
different companies have different strategies. %$* 376
but normally, in a market, if you were going to offer an inferior product, you would try to beat your competitors on price. %$* 376
but apple and google don't do that either. %$* 376
in fact, apple tried to team up with book publishers to make prices higher. %$* 376
so, it becomes pretty natural, you know? %$* 376
amazon has this market share because they have a better product, a better product than their digital competitors. %$* 376
and if you compare it to their brick and mortar competitors, you know, there's no-- %$* 376
there's no competition. %$* 376
it's cheaper to get digital books. %$* 376
it's much more convenient to get digital books. %$* 376
it's much more flexible. %$* 376
you can take them along when you're traveling. %$* 376
and amazon also has a store where if you're looking for something-- %$* 376
you know, you put it in there. %$* 376
and if it doesn't exist in a digital form, you can order the paper book, right? %$* 376
that's really neat. %$* 376
it's a good convenience, because when there's something you want to read, you know, you really want to get the text that you want. %$* 376
you don't care as much about the format. %$* 376
the other digital companies don't do that. %$* 376
all of which is you know, it's a long way of getting to the point, but it's to say that amazon has won its market share the best possible way to win market share. %$* 376
it's by doing a better job, offering a better service at a better price. %$* 376
long story short, they're the reader's friend, you know? %$* 376
so, we're debating this in new york city. %$* 376
new york is a great city. %$* 376
i know new york very well. %$* 376
i grew up here. %$* 376
i grew up on 12th street and university place, down in the village. %$* 376
and i remember, when i was a kid, right in the neighborhood, you know, you could go to broadway. %$* 376
there was a shakespeare and company down maybe on 4th street. %$* 376
there was a forbidden planet, which had comic books and specialty sci-fi books. %$* 376
you have the strand, which is this fantastic used bookstore. %$* 376
we had i think it was the original outlet of barnes & noble over a few blocks further north from there. %$* 376
and, of course, you also have here in new york probably the greatest public library system in the world. %$* 376
this is like part of what makes new york an amazing place. %$* 376
but it's important when you're thinking about this issue to not think with these sort of narrow new york blinders on and to recall that you know lots of people live in places that are not as big, places that do not have as many-- %$* 376
did not traditionally have as much diversity in terms of book retailing, where you might be talking about a lengthy drive to one bookstore, a limited selection that's there, a library that, you know, maybe has some capacity to get loans from other places, but, again, it had its own kind of constraints. %$* 376
what you have in the digital space, it's this vast stockpile, you can get any kind of book you want. %$* 376
you can go get public domain books, download them for free off amazon. %$* 376
and this is a-- %$* 376
really like an incredible bounty. %$* 376
i think there's a red herring out there that on one side of this debate is people who love amazon and on the other side of the debate are people who think books are an important cultural artifact. %$* 376
culture matters. %$* 376
books are crucial to our society. %$* 376
and that's exactly why it is so important that amazon has made it cheaper, easier, and more convenient for people all around the country and in a growing number of countries, to access these crucial cultural artifacts. %$* 376
books aren't widgets. %$* 376
books matter. %$* 376
and that's why it's so important that you recognize that amazon truly is the reader's friend and vote for this resolution. %$* 376
thank you. %$* 376
thank you, matt yglesias. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "amazon is the reader's friend." and our next debater will be arguing against it, scott turow. %$* 13
scott turow is an attorney and author of 12 books, including his newest novel, "identical." ladies and gentlemen, scott turow. %$* 13
well, i listened to matt carefully, and i want to begin with a major concession. %$* 378
he is not totally insane. %$* 378
the-- %$* 378
he is right, of course, about certain things. %$* 378
amazon charges low prices. %$* 378
amazon has built a better mousetrap. %$* 378
their software is great. %$* 378
but that's really not here-- %$* 378
all that we're here to talk about. %$* 378
the question isn't whether jeff bezos bears some faint resemblance to lex luthor. %$* 378
the question is whether amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 378
and in defining that-- %$* 378
or i'd like to be a little lawyerly, i'd like to talk about two things and focus on two words. %$* 378
the first, of course, is "reader's," because readers are more than mere consumers. %$* 378
we agree that books are more than widgets. %$* 378
they bear our culture, thought, knowledge with them. %$* 378
and as frank foer is going to talk about when he comes to the podium, amazon is doing great damage to our literary culture. %$* 378
the second word and perhaps one i want to focus on most is the word, "friend." "friend," as we commonly understand the term, means somebody you can rely on to treat your interests as equal to their own. %$* 378
and instead what the record demonstrates is that amazon is nobody's friend but amazon's. %$* 378
they are capitalists of a particularly ruthless breed who, in point of fact, have habitually turned on their business allies whenever it meets their business needs. %$* 378
and, in point of fact, matt, they are beginning to do this now to readers. %$* 378
matt concedes that amazon has a huge market share. %$* 378
i don't-- %$* 378
even sort of waving your hands and saying that i don't think does full justice to the magnitude of the power amazon currently exerts. %$* 378
they sell three-fourths of the physical books that get sold in this country online. %$* 378
they sell at least that many ebooks, especially when you count the market that's starting to grow where joe is-- %$* 378
has been so successful, that is to say, "self-published" authors. %$* 378
there are parts of the book market that amazon literally just owns. %$* 378
they have bought up the two largest producers of audio books. %$* 378
they bought the biggest seller of used and rare books, of books sold to the international market, of print on demand books, of self- published-- %$* 378
physical self-published books, and, of course, they've swallowed up sites like goodreads, or, bookfinder, that might have become competitors to them, another place where readers could have bought books. %$* 378
now, to matt i have to say that anybody who believes that amazon will use this power only in friendship has not read lord acton or machiavelli. %$* 378
amazon already pushes books forward on their site at the expense of others for business purposes, or worse, for political purposes, and their tactics vary between the ruthless to the underhanded. %$* 378
is amazon being the reader's friend, matt, when they alter search results in exchange for promotional payments without acknowledging to their readers that they do that? %$* 378
or consider the subject you talked about, the chokehold that amazon got on ebooks with the introduction of the kindle in 2007. first-- %$* 378
and the only innovation in the kindle, by the way, was not the device. %$* 378
it wasn't e-ink. %$* 378
all-- %$* 378
it wasn't digital books. %$* 378
all of those had existed. %$* 378
the innovation was when amazon convinced the publishers to allow digital books, ebooks, to be sold at the same time that hardcovers went on the sale-- %$* 378
went on sale. %$* 378
the publishers agreed, and as soon as they did that, friendly amazon backstabbed the publishers and began selling ebooks at a loss of $3 to $4 apiece on average. %$* 378
now, people like to say that amazon sold ebooks at a loss to promote the sale of the kindle. %$* 378
that frankly is bologna. %$* 378
if you want to promote kindles, sell them at a loss. %$* 378
amazon sold ebooks at a loss for two reasons, to stifle competition-- %$* 378
they wanted to prevent anybody else, competing device makers, places like bookstores, which would've been a great place to buy ebooks-- %$* 378
they wanted to prevent them from going into the market in competition with them. %$* 378
they artificially-- %$* 378
the second thing they did by selling at a loss is they tilted the market away from physical books, the books published by the publishers who had gone into this business with them, and, of course, in the process, put businesses like borders, not to mention thousands of bookstores, out of business. %$* 378
and this loss selling was not honest free-market competition on a level playing field. %$* 378
it was frankly a mugging sponsored by wall street. %$* 378
for 20 years since the company was established, wall street has given amazon unlimited capital, clearly with the expectation that even though the company didn't report a profit, sooner or later they would reap the immense profits that are bound to come from knocking all the competition aside. %$* 378
then last year, amazon-- %$* 378
wall street finally became concerned. %$* 378
when is this company ever going to make a profit? %$* 378
the amazon share price slid by 25 percent, and amazon reacted by squeezing its suppliers, which is to say publishers and authors, and, of course, readers. %$* 378
this is what led to the dispute between hachette and amazon where amazon punished not only the company but also hachette authors by subverting the sale of hachette books. %$* 378
they disserved authors like joe, self-published authors, by starting a subscription series that undercut the income of authors like joe, who's admitted that in print. %$* 378
and finally, of course, amazon started raising book prices. %$* 378
the company that announced in 2001 it would sell any book over $20 at a 30 percent discount no longer adheres to that practice. %$* 378
all right. %$* 378
thank you. %$* 378
scott turow, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
all right. %$* 378
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 378
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, the moderator, and we have four debaters, two against two, arguing it out over this motion, "amazon is the reader's friend."we have heard from the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's please welcome to the lectern joe konrath. %$* 13
he is author of the bestselling "jack daniels" thriller series that has sold over a million ebooks through self-publishing. %$* 13
joe konrath. %$* 13
wow, i am so happy to be here, and i'm glad you're all seated after listening to scott's monologue because he just proved that amazon is engaging in nefarious acts of capitalism. %$* 375
i'm smiling right now-- %$* 375
seriously, what the heck am i doing on this panel? %$* 375
we've got two journalists on this panel. %$* 375
we've got a lawyer on this panel. %$* 375
we've got a lawyer on this panel who did what all the lawyers wish they could do. %$* 375
he actually saved an innocent man from death row. %$* 375
he did. %$* 375
okay. %$* 375
that's enough. %$* 375
his head is big enough. %$* 375
innocent man from death row. %$* 375
these guys went to harvard. %$* 375
they went to stanford. %$* 375
they went to columbia university. %$* 375
i went to columbia college. %$* 375
it is not affiliated. %$* 375
i majored in budweiser. %$* 375
and you think oh, that's a blow off major, but i still only got a 2.2 gpa. %$* 375
you know what, that may have been a 2.2 blood alcohol level. %$* 375
i couldn't remember the finals at all. %$* 375
i'm telling you. %$* 375
but i am very happy to be up here and i'm going to keep smiling because i really can't believe that i am here. %$* 375
who's seen the movie "the paper chase"? %$* 375
it's about a harvard law student working his butt off, taking classes, studying to actually become a big lawyer, and scott actually did that. %$* 375
and when i went to school i was in my dorm making a sofa out of empty beer cans. %$* 375
so why am i here? %$* 375
i don't know why i'm here. %$* 375
okay, i've sold some books. %$* 375
okay, i like amazon. %$* 375
by a show of hands, how many people here have bought something from amazon? %$* 375
okay. %$* 375
let's tell our listeners that that's everybody in the room. %$* 13
that is everybody in the room. %$* 375
by a show of hands, how many people hate raising their hands? %$* 375
that's meta. %$* 375
you're going to laugh about that later. %$* 375
let's get on topic here. %$* 375
scott brought up publishers. %$* 375
amazon is the big bad guy, but what about these publishers? %$* 375
well, you know what? %$* 375
publishers are the bad guy and i'm going to tell you why. %$* 375
he said earlier we need publishers for culture, for rich literary culture. %$* 375
that's incorrect. %$* 375
publishers don't write books. %$* 375
authors write the books. %$* 375
authors are the ones who impart this rich literary culture. %$* 375
the publishers are just high-priced middle men, okay? %$* 375
let's talk about publishers and all of the books they have rejected. %$* 375
publishers reject hundreds of books for everyone that they publish. %$* 375
now think about that. %$* 375
that's censorship. %$* 375
it really is. %$* 375
there are thousands of books out there that you have never seen because the guardians of culture, those publishers, have never published them. %$* 375
nine of them were mine. %$* 375
i got more than 500 rejections. %$* 375
yeah, i know, every time the mailman came i had to pop a prozac. %$* 375
i eventually did get published after my 10th book and then i learned more about publishers. %$* 375
i learned that publishers charge too much. %$* 375
scott's new book, which i'm sure is excellent, the publisher nicely printed the price right on the cover, $28.00 for a hardcover. %$* 375
wow, 28 bucks. %$* 375
if you can't afford that and you're a huge turow fan you can wait a year and get the cheaper priced paperback. %$* 375
that's called windowing. %$* 375
that doesn't seem like publishers are really friends to readers. %$* 375
they would give them that paperback earlier because the paperback vastly outsells the hardcover. %$* 375
publishers give out advances. %$* 375
they give an author an advance. %$* 375
now, i got a nice advance according to publisher's weekly, $30,000 bucks and i was pleased to get it and i felt i was really lucky because the average advance is $5,000.you're not going to live off $5,000, especially since publishers pay you that over the course of three years. %$* 375
in small payments twice a year, because publishers only pay twice a year. %$* 375
it-- %$* 375
a word on advances before i get off that topic, an advance has to be paid back in copies sold, okay? %$* 375
and it's a very high interest loan. %$* 375
if i self-publish on amazon, which i have done successfully many times, in fact since i started self-publishing on amazon, my income went up 20 percent. %$* 375
oh no wait. %$* 375
that's wrong. %$* 375
it went up 20 times. %$* 375
so it went up 2,000 percent. %$* 375
my best year traditionally published i made 50 grand. %$* 375
last year i made a million dollars. %$* 375
that's still 50 grand after taxes. %$* 375
what it comes down to is publishers are deciding what you read and what you won't read. %$* 375

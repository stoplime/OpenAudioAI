when you-- %$* 13
when you go online and google yourself-- %$* 13
and we know that you do google yourself. %$* 13
i do it. %$* 13
i did it once. %$* 13
i've done it. %$* 13
do you always like what it is that you see? %$* 13
because sometimes some of it can be unflattering. %$* 13
and is that how you want to be remembered, by those links to unflattering things five years from now or 50 years from now? %$* 13
or do you wish that you had the power to get some of those links removed? %$* 13
but if you had that power, what if somebody who had done something bad had that power? %$* 13
what if a doctor who had committed malpractice also wanted to get his links taken down? %$* 13
would that be a good thing or a bad thing? %$* 13
well, in europe, they do have something of a system that allows individuals to do this. %$* 13
they call it the "right to be forgotten." and the question is, should we have that right here? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online," a debate from intelligence squared us.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city with four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online.” as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side ones. %$* 13
the motion again, "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online."let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome paul nemitz. %$* 13
paul, you are the director of this-- %$* 13
of this organization, this agency: the fundamental rights and union citizenship in the directorate general for justice and consumers of the european commission, otherwise known as the frucdgjcec. %$* 13
and in that, you are responsible for the enforcement of privacy rights in europe. %$* 13
and you have been quoted as saying, to google, you have said, "you have no right to see me naked," by which you meant what? %$* 13
i meant that there are limits to snooping, collecting and making my private life public on google. %$* 274
and that's what you're going to be arguing tonight. %$* 13
and tell us who is your partner in that argument. %$* 13
the eminent professor eric posner from chicago university law school. %$* 274
ladies and gentlemen, eric posner. %$* 13
yes, eric, you are a law professor. %$* 13
you've written the book most recently "the twilight of international human rights law." and back in the u.s., when europe passed its "right to be forgotten” law a little while back, most american academics were quite skeptical and even outraged, and you said actually that you thought it sounded perfectly sensible. %$* 13
so, my question is have more of the critics come over to your side now? %$* 13
no, they haven't, but i'm hoping they'll change their minds soon enough. %$* 275
especially after tonight. %$* 13
especially after tonight. %$* 275
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for the motion that "the u.s. should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." %$* 13
and we have two debaters arguing vociferously against this motion. %$* 13
please, let's welcome andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
andrew, you are now the ceo of digg and instapaper. %$* 13
you were an advisor to president obama on internet technology policy. %$* 13
you are a former director of global public policy at google. %$* 13
you have called the eu decision a "travesty." you're no longer at google, but if you were, would you be using that kind of language? %$* 13
well, i’d probably use less restrained language if i were still at google. %$* 276
the effect of the decision on that company is kind of singular. %$* 276
there's really no place in the world that's been so affected by it. %$* 276
but i do think it's a travesty. %$* 276
okay, we're making clear you're not here tonight as the google guy. %$* 13
and tell us who your partner is, andrew? %$* 13
the equally eminent professor jonathan zittrain. %$* 276
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
the eminent jonathan zittrain, you're a professor of law and computer science at harvard. %$* 13
you're a cofounder of the berkman center for internet & society. %$* 13
you looked at the eu's-- %$* 13
europe's "right to be forgotten," and you said that there is a certain elegance to the idea because it-- %$* 13
you're saying something should not follow you around for life. %$* 13
but does that mean essentially you agree with the other side? %$* 13
well, we could end early and just hit the bar, but-- %$* 277
i've described the "right to be forgotten" as a poor solution to a very real problem. %$* 277
and in that sense i have many sympathies not just with the other side but probably with everyone in the room who wants that ability to get something taken down sometimes. %$* 277
all right. %$* 13
we're very interested to see where you go with that argument. %$* 13
again, the motion is, "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online," in this debate, and it is a debate. %$* 13
this is an intellectual joust where only one side will win, and that side will be chosen by vote of our audience here in new york city. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you'll have been asked to vote twice on your view on this motion for or against. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's register the first vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat, take a look again at the motion on the screens. %$* 13
it says, "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online."push number one if you're for the motion, number two if you're against, and number three if you're undecided. %$* 13
and we'll take about 15 seconds to complete that process, and then we'll lock out the voting devices. %$* 13
all right, folks, let's lock out those votes. %$* 13
and, again, we'll have the second vote right after you've heard the closing arguments. %$* 13
and then we'll have the results of the difference between the two votes within about a minute and a half. %$* 13
our motion is this, "the u.s. should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn, and here to argue in support of this motion, paul nemitz. %$* 13
he is director for fundamental rights & union citizenship in the directorate general for justice & consumers of the european commission. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul nemitz. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 274
thank you. %$* 274
so let me say, first of all, i'm not here on an official mission from the european commission to turn america to this notion of law. %$* 274
it's more the academic pleasure and the opportunity to come to manhattan and discuss with these great american thinkers. %$* 274
and i will just report to you how this works in europe and where it comes from. %$* 274
so, first of all, the "right to be forgotten," the words, the natural words, they don't tell you the whole story, because actually it is about a deletion right. %$* 274
it is about you exercising control over personal data, you asking big corporations or the state to delete this data which they have about you. %$* 274
why this is important? %$* 274
it is important because it allows you to control your own life. %$* 274
in the language of the german constitutional court, already from the '70s, this was called informational self-determination, and the judges said in a democracy, in a free country, you as an individual must have the right to control what others know about you. %$* 274
you must be able to ask “what do you have? %$* 274
” and you must be able to ask for deletion, of course within reason. %$* 274
you cannot ask a doctor to delete the medical records, because the doctor must keep them either to show what he has done or she has done in terms of liability. %$* 274
of course you can't ask the press to delete a bad review if you are a concert pianist, or for that matter if you are someone who has done malpractice or if you are a politician. %$* 274
there are limits to this, which are limits which are important in a democratic society, because that's what you will hear from the other side, that this is an attack on democracy. %$* 274
we see that differently in europe. %$* 274
we believe democracy needs both. %$* 274
it needs privacy. %$* 274
it needs the ability of the individual to decide himself or herself what the state in particular knows about them, because if you don't have the privacy, how can you organize dissent? %$* 274
how can you organize a new political party, which maybe wants to if already the government always knows everything about you. %$* 274
so, we need privacy in a free society as we need free speech, and therefore, and now i turn to the recent judgment. %$* 274
first of all, you have to understand this just doesn't fall from the sky like this, but it is application of existing law which we have in europe since 1995.and it is basically a right to ask a big corporation to delete information about you. %$* 274
google argued in the case, “this doesn't apply to us. %$* 274
we are not what we call in europe a data controller.” our judges saw that differently. %$* 274
they said sure, you control data about individuals and you profile them. %$* 274
when you put in the name of an individual, google gives you more than anything else, any other source of information about this person, and our law requires that in the same way that our people can ask data brokers, the bank, you know, they can ask in school after a certain time for things to be deleted, they should be able to ask google for deletion. %$* 274
now, the person in question who brought this case from spain, he had not paid some social contributions and therefore his house had been confiscated and it was a legal obligation in spain to have a publication in a newspaper of this fact in order to make the auctioning of the house to cover the social contributions better and attractive for the spanish state, because if it's in the newspaper there will be more people bidding for this house. %$* 274
so, the court said you cannot ask the newspaper to take down the information because they have a legal obligation to publish, but google you can ask. %$* 274
and this is a principle which also applies when it comes to free speech and democracy. %$* 274
it may well be that google has to put things-- %$* 274
take things down, but it doesn't mean the information disappears. %$* 274
it will stay in the newspaper. %$* 274
it stays on the website of the newspaper of the bbc, of the television station, all this stays around, but google is subject to the same law of self-control of information, of self-determination of individuals, which allows them to ask first what do you have about me and second, please delete. %$* 274
does it work? %$* 274
yes, it works well. %$* 274
i just last week met the chief privacy officer of google. %$* 274
he told me that now they are dealing with these requests in real time. %$* 274
in the beginning there were around 200,000 requests and they had to employ a number of new staff to deal with this, but now it works well. %$* 274
there are practically no complaints which do go to the court. %$* 274
google has understood the european law of balance between privacy and free speech. %$* 274
the decisions, you know, in the beginning very contested. %$* 274
i think in the meantime everybody says this is working well. %$* 274
and finally, this is something which is important for the future, because more and more data about you will be collected in the digital age, in the internet age, in the age of ever stronger censors, wearables, internet of things and so on. %$* 274
so, when you think tonight about the motion, think about these new censors. %$* 274
think about the apple watch. %$* 274
think about the department store in manhattan which now follows you on your mobile phone wherever you stand. %$* 274
all this is collected and recorded and there are address dealers and information dealers which have files on you with between 200 and 2,000 parameters, about every person. %$* 274
and these files, they are sold. %$* 274
for example, in a political campaign. %$* 274
those who have more money, they can buy these files and target you as a voter. %$* 274
if you say, "i as an individual want to have control over my data and what's happening to them and i want my children to have control, and i want to have, as a parent, control over what happens to data of my children, then you should vote in favor of the motion: "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." last remark: you already have it in some parts of the united states, in some parts of law. %$* 274
for example, in california, there is now a law which gives the possibility for parents to say, and children when they become 18, to wipe out everything until they were 18. in the fair credit and reporting act about your credit, information which is older than seven years, you can ask to be deleted. %$* 274
so it is already there in part, and the federal trade commissioner, julie brill just yesterday said, “wes, this is what we need in america, a right to obscurity.” thank you very much. %$* 274
thank you, paul nemitz. %$* 13
and the motion is that "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." and here to make his argument against this motion, andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
he is the ceo of dig and instapaper. %$* 13
he is a former us deputy chief technology officer for the obama administration. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 276
my mission here tonight is not to persuade you that the internet is perfect the way that it is. %$* 276
my mission is to urge you to vote against the resolution. %$* 276
and unlike paul, i am of the view that this so-called "right to be forgotten" in the eu is an epically bad decision, a travesty, an example of great moral and institutional failure on the part of the european union itself. %$* 276
but my mission here tonight is somewhat more narrow, which is to secure your vote against the motion. %$* 276
as jonathan alluded to, the emotional underpinnings of this motion, the emotional rationale that lies behind the "right to be forgotten" is powerful. %$* 276
and it is understandable. %$* 276
there are many people on this planet that have made mistakes in their past, and the internet for them acts as some kind of a permanent record that follows them everywhere. %$* 276
and the fear that it generates is that you will forever be defined by that one mistake that you made, that ended up on the internet or in the press. %$* 276
the problem, though, is the following. %$* 276
and this is what i'm going to try to persuade you of. %$* 276
first, the "right to be forgotten" is, no matter how you try to construct it, censorship. %$* 276
censorship has to clear a very high bar in order to be justified in a free and democratic society. %$* 276
the "right to be forgotten" does not clear that bar. %$* 276
there are vastly better ways to accommodate the emotional rationale for the "right to be forgotten". %$* 276
and that doesn't even really get into the implementation dilemmas, all of the different practical reasons why this thing will never, in any meaningful sense, become a right. %$* 276
so that's the outline of the argument that i'm going to make. %$* 276
let me just begin with a key point, which is the "right to be forgotten" is censorship. %$* 276
note the odd passive voice in the construction of the right: "the right to be forgotten." we call it a right, but really, it's a duty. %$* 276
and paul owned up to this very directly in his opening statement. %$* 276
the "right to be forgotten" is a duty to be able to force other people to forget what they would otherwise remember. %$* 276
that ability, that right to remember is one of the most fundamental rights i think of being a human being. %$* 276
by suppressing true information-- %$* 276
and let's be very clear, that is what we're talking about here. %$* 276
we're talking about the suppression of true information, not libel, not defamation, not hate speech. %$* 276
true information intrudes into our collective memory by trying to suppress the documents that constitute that memory. %$* 276
so, we're talking about the regulation of speech and, really, the regulation of thought which is ultimately what memory is. %$* 276
so, this is the right to force people to forget true information. %$* 276
paul said that this is a-- %$* 276
the way he framed it was that this is a right to control your own life, the right to demand deletion. %$* 276
the problem, though, is that i have the right to control what i remember. %$* 276
i have the right to control what i say. %$* 276
i do not have the right to control what you remember. %$* 276
i do not have the right to control what you say. %$* 276
and so for that reason, we must treat the "right to be forgotten" as it is, which is a form of censorship. %$* 276
so, as i said, censorship in a free and democratic society needs to clear a very high bar to be-- %$* 276
to be justified. %$* 276
the "right to be forgotten" does not meet that bar. %$* 276
first of all, it's way too prone to abuse. %$* 276
it is vague, it is subjective. %$* 276
the language in the european courts' decision is that information should be deleted from searches about the person if it is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer irrelevant or excessive. %$* 276
i challenge you to find a more vague and subjective legal standard anywhere in the law of a free society. %$* 276
it's very clear, by the way, as a practical matter, that this law favors the interests of well-connected elites in europe, those who are wealthy, those who are in office, those who would like to suppress embarrassing facts about their lives. %$* 276
and-- %$* 276
contrary to paul's claim that it's working kind of well, you can google-- %$* 276
well, you can google while you can-- %$* 276
any number of articles. %$* 276
the ones that i found were in the english language press in the uk outlining all of the articles that have been suppressed, because google gives notification to the publisher when an article has been suppressed. %$* 276
and so you will find crimes, you will find criticism, you'll find the case of the piano player who didn't like a 2010 washington post unflattering review of a concert that he gave. %$* 276
but there are many, many examples: a lecturer who was suspended got an article about that discipline-- %$* 276
disciplinary action suppressed; a man who tried to kill members of his own family was able to have those articles suppressed in searches about his name. %$* 276
and these are from like 2010, 2011.these are not ancient history. %$* 276
so, one other point that i want to make is that the "right to be forgotten" undermines our moral standing, vis-a- vis dictatorships. %$* 276
in a society with steady rule of law, i suppose it's conceivable that you could have some kind of court mechanism adjudicate the "right to be forgotten" and come up with a body of case law that would define the bounds of the right, flush it out and so forth. %$* 276
but in most of the world, that's not the case. %$* 276
i guarantee you that the dictators in many parts of the world have a different view about what is relevant and irrelevant about their pasts than we have, and they would gladly use this right to suppress speech and to justify it in their own countries. %$* 276
so, as i said before, there are better ways to accommodate this right. %$* 276
for example, in the american tradition, we believe in not censorship, but more speech. %$* 276
so, for example, if there are links on google, a better solution might be to say that the subject of the search could add a link, add a comment, or add a symbol that would click you through to whatever you want to say about that link. %$* 276
you might have a right to respond as opposed to a right to censor. %$* 276
moreover, we've seen that the internet adapts. %$* 276
we've seen the rise of applications like snapchat, wuut, w-u-u-t, which are applications that are designed to not be searchable and to facilitate communication without a permanent record being compiled and assembled. %$* 276
in other words, rather than scrubbing information embarrassing to a person, we might even think more broadly about, as a society, how do we treat past mistakes and past errors? %$* 276
can we learn to broaden and embrace and allow for the self-reinvention that in so many ways defines what it is to be american? %$* 276
that space for personal development and trial and error as you grow up can be accommodated if, as a society, we learn perhaps not to disenfranchise ex-felons for the rest of their lives, not to penalize them by making it difficult to get a job and so forth. %$* 276
and so finally, i'll just end on this note, which is that, you know, as george orwell said, "he who controls the past controls the future." giving any number of individuals a vague standard by which to control their own pasts and thereby try to control their own futures has incredibly negative effects. %$* 276
this right is not necessary. %$* 276
i urge you to vote against the motion. %$* 276
thank you, andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through this opening round of the intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
and we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." you've heard two of the opening arguments and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's welcome to the lecturn, eric posner. %$* 13
he is the kirkland and ellis distinguished service professor of law at the university of chicago. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, eric posner. %$* 13
i'd like to ask you to cast your minds back 25 years, 30 years. %$* 275
for those of you who are old enough, or some of the younger people here, i'll just have to tell you what it was like then, when we enjoyed something called "privacy." and privacy is a complicated concept, so i want to convey it to you with a few examples. %$* 275
so, imagine a 17-year-old boy, he's arrested for selling drugs. %$* 275
a news item appears in the local paper. %$* 275
the police then realize they made a mistake, and they let him go. %$* 275
that's not published in the newspaper. %$* 275
now, the people around him in his neighborhood may know about this, they may not know about it. %$* 275
they know a lot about this kid. %$* 275
he moves on with his life. %$* 275
it's not a big deal. %$* 275
second example: a single mom is depressed, she has-- %$* 275
her kids-- %$* 275
her hands full with her kids. %$* 275
she sees a psychotherapist, she misses some credit card bills, files for bankruptcy. %$* 275
but bankruptcy gives her a fresh start. %$* 275
she gets back on her feet, and she's able to continue with her life. %$* 275
now, again, her friends and neighbors might know a bit about this, but they also know about her and what she's like and how she is a good mother. %$* 275
so, they know a little bit about what's going on but they still have a relatively complete image of who she is. %$* 275
a third example, a married couple has a terrible divorce. %$* 275
they file for divorce in court. %$* 275
they say terrible things to each other, flinging wild accusations, some of which may contain an element of truth, some of which is exaggerated. %$* 275
they might refer to each other's infidelity. %$* 275
they might allege that the other spouse neglected the children or said bad things about them. %$* 275
eventually the divorce is settled, and they move on with their lives. %$* 275
so, in all these cases, these events happened. %$* 275
they were public to some extent but at the same time they're private. %$* 275
not everybody in the world or even outside this area hears about these events. %$* 275
and the law protects them. %$* 275
there are privacy laws-- %$* 275
there were privacy laws, they still exist. %$* 275
there are even laws called, "expungement statutes," that would have allowed the teenager, for example, to erase his arrest record after a period of time had passed. %$* 275
and although free speech was robust at that time, so were privacy rights. %$* 275
people understood that while other people would have an interest in knowing things about you and talking about you, individuals also have an interest in controlling information about themselves, not necessarily political information, it could just be personal information, things that are embarrassing. %$* 275
now, i want you to imagine back then in 1990 that an academic-- %$* 275
a kooky academic like me or jonathan came up with the following proposal. %$* 275
we would say, "this is a terrible state of affairs that we have," because, after all, if a stranger meets someone-- %$* 275
let's say it could be an employer or a creditor or a future romantic partner-- %$* 275
it's really in the stranger's interest to be able to know as much about this person as possible. %$* 275
maybe a future employer would want to know that this kid had been arrested. %$* 275
even if he wasn't convicted, it's still information that would be useful. %$* 275
so to solve this problem of massive social ignorance, what we should do is record everything that everybody does, put it onto a searchable database, and make this database available to everybody in the world. %$* 275
okay, so if somebody had made a proposal, even someone like jonathan, smart guy, or me, not so smart guy, we would have been laughed out of the room, that-- %$* 275
"what a ridiculous proposal, what a tremendous invasion of people's privacy." but, of course, this is what's happened. %$* 275
it's happened over the last 20 or 30 years, not because of a conscious decision by the public or by the government to implement this crazy recording system, but because of the development of the internet. %$* 275
now, what happened? %$* 275
the law has remained the same, but a very important element of privacy back in the '80s and '90s and before then was simply the physical configuration of the environment. %$* 275
it was just very difficult to collect information about people and disseminate it. %$* 275
okay. %$* 275
that's completely changed. %$* 275
technology has changed. %$* 275
so the law at the time-- %$* 275
the privacy laws at the time could be relatively weak, and yet people's privacy was adequately protected, but now, with this technological change, this old balance between my interest in controlling information about myself and your interest in knowing about me has been upset. %$* 275
and all that the "right to be forgotten" would do is restore this balance. %$* 275
okay, so, if we go through these three people again, this kid, 10, 15 years later-- %$* 275
let's suppose all of this happened, you know, in the last few years-- %$* 275
he applies for a job, the employer puts his name in google, first thing that comes up is this arrest. %$* 275
now, the employer might understand that this is not important, but he might. %$* 275
this is the only thing that comes up about this guy. %$* 275
why not pass him by and hire somebody else? %$* 275
maybe the single mother's friends, you know, in the '90s they would have gossiped when maybe today they would write about it on facebook. %$* 275
maybe she would've written about it on facebook or on a blog. %$* 275
now a potential romantic partner, employer, neighbor, colleague puts her name in-- %$* 275
maybe she moves to a new city-- %$* 275
puts her name in and immediately finds out that she had a mental illness. %$* 275
that's how she's going to be defined to the public. %$* 275
and in the case of the divorced couple, in the old days divorce would be public. %$* 275
it's public information. %$* 275
but it was, you know, put in a file that was stored in the basement of a courthouse. %$* 275
if you wanted to, you could find out about that information, but nobody had any interest at least with respect to ordinary people. %$* 275
nowadays, you know, their children could type their parents’ names into google and out comes these allegations. %$* 275
and, of course, not only their children, but future employers, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, anybody in the world, anywhere they go. %$* 275
so, they've lost control over this information about themselves and it's not just that they've lost this control, they've lost the important context. %$* 275
you know, the neighbors, the people in the neighborhood, they know the context of these events. %$* 275
the strangers who do the google search do not. %$* 275
so, the right to be forgotten would simply restore us, at least partly, to this older period of time. %$* 275
people were happy with the balance between privacy and speech in those days, and i think people would be happy with this balance again if privacy were improved somewhat. %$* 275
so, for that reason you should vote in favor of the motion for the "right to be forgotten" online in the united states. %$* 275
thank you very much. %$* 275
thank you, eric posner. %$* 13
and that is the motion, "the u.s.should adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online." and here to make his argument against this motion, please welcome jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
he is the george bemis professor of law at harvard law school and the kennedy-- %$* 13
school of government. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
thank you very much, john, and thank you all. %$* 277
i guess i should start with some points of agreement. %$* 277
so, if the question is are there problems with privacy? %$* 277
yes, there are. %$* 277
and if that were the motion i would hope you would join us in voting for it. %$* 277
if the question were have problems of privacy gotten more difficult over time? %$* 277
we'd vote for that motion, too. %$* 277
i think i'm comfortable saying andrew would vote for it. %$* 277
if the motion were should everything be recorded at all times and if so, should we do something about that? %$* 277
i would also be in favor, but none of these is the motion. %$* 277
the question is about a right to be forgotten and i want to explain my opening statement that that's a very bad solution to a very real problem. %$* 277
so, let's take an example. %$* 277
imagine that there was something that i could say right now that would be not felicitous for someone in the world. %$* 277
that's not that hard to imagine. %$* 277
and this debate gets recorded, the podcast goes up, and at some point that aggrieved person files a dispute with google over the existence of this recording, the web page hosting it. %$* 277
google will receive that request, that complaint, and it is bound not to tell anybody about it. %$* 277
google then thinks about it. %$* 277
how does google think? %$* 277
companies don't think except with ai.eventually this will be ai, but not yet. %$* 277
so, they have i assume some interns? %$* 277
somebody making $10 an hour that is just getting a stream of those 100,000 requests, it's like time to make the donuts, you're like yes, no, no, and paul's like, you know, they've really learned. %$* 277
they've gotten good at this, and that's because if they don't grant the request, the aggrieved person can appeal in europe to a data protection authority. %$* 277
i presume there'd be something similar here. %$* 277
that's bad. %$* 277
that's more process. %$* 277
if google grants the request, that's it. %$* 277
intelligence squared wouldn't be informed that their page is no longer findable through the world's most powerful information resource? %$* 277
there'd be no appeal by anyone else. %$* 277
at the moment when it is granted google notifies the telegraph, for example, if a story on the telegraph is taken out of the google index as a result of this right. %$* 277
the european union is fighting that notification, because it observes when the telegraph puts it out, here's what was deleted today, it kind of defeats the purpose of deleting it from google. %$* 277
it has to be built into this right that we have no idea what we're actually talking about, which is why, oddly enough, as much as google hates this gift, they're like looking at the box and it's ticking, i'm hoping they don't open it. %$* 277
i'm hoping they continue to fight it, because at some point they may make accommodation with it and when they do it will mean that the one protection we have had, apologies, andrew, to your former employer, against google basically running the world is that even google doesn't know what comes up in google search results. %$* 277
it's a roulette wheel even to them, but once they cross that blood-brain barrier and start hand-tweaking results on request, like a dj taking in what somebody wants, well, why shouldn't they just do it generally to improve things? %$* 277
and at that point the reality we experience will be one set by this company. %$* 277
and that's what's so strange. %$* 277
if there's going to be something taken out, let a court adjudicate it. %$* 277
let it do so in camera. %$* 277
that is to say in secret so the fact that it's adjudicating doesn't spill the beans. %$* 277
that should be extremely rare. %$* 277
it should be for corner cases, maybe for cases of the sort that eric was bringing up. %$* 277
but it cannot be hundreds of thousands of things getting processed because it won't just be ai on google’s side taking it out, it'll be ai on the complainant's side. %$* 277
i'll write a check to somebody every month, a company that will go ahead, and every time it sees my name in what might not be a good light, it'll automatically file a request on my behalf, and i don't even need to be any the wiser. %$* 277
this starts to be eliminating the middle man so much that it eliminates us from the process of understanding the world. %$* 277
now, i think i should end, then, by talking a little bit about the ecosystem in which this ill-considered proposal has its best shot at succeeding. %$* 277
and it's today's ecosystem. %$* 277
and basically, it's just google. %$* 277
i'm like, “bing, how many of you are getting? %$* 277
” they’re like, “we can't tell you.” it's like, “you can't tell us because there's so many or because nobody is bothering to take anything out of bing? %$* 277
” apologies to microsoft. %$* 277
but if we ended up with wikisearch-- %$* 277
with-- %$* 277
do you remember dogpile? %$* 277
it would do searches of multiple search engines at once. %$* 277
does each company now have to start fronting a system to start taking stuff down? %$* 277
what if it is wiki? %$* 277
what if it's a nonprofit? %$* 277
in fact, what if it's a wiki page of wikipedia that's taken down, and the page gets changed so the objectionable material is gone, it's been edited out, it's been improved? %$* 277
who goes back to undelete the hole in the swiss cheese? %$* 277
the answer is no one. %$* 277
until these questions can be answered, and maybe they can, back to you guys, i say, please vote against this motion even as you pluck a violin along with us for the very real problems that the for side is rightfully bringing up. %$* 277
we've got to work on this stuff. %$* 277
maybe court records shouldn't be immediately google searchable. %$* 277
there should be some frame that keeps that cat a little bit in the bag. %$* 277
we can go case by case and try to come up with categories of information. %$* 277
but if we just stick with a generalized right for, in the words of the decision by the european court of justice, "no longer relevant in the view of the complainant," information to be taken out and procedures that must, by their nature, be secret, we will be betraying all of the great things that the information revolution has brought us along with the bad. %$* 277
thank you very much. %$* 277
thank you, jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared us debate, where our motion is the us should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
keep in mind, please, how you voted at the top of the evening. %$* 13
again, we're going to have you vote a second time after you have heard all of the arguments. %$* 13
and it will be the team whose numbers have moved the most who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another in turn and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here at the kaufman center in new york city. %$* 13
our motion is, the us should adopt the "right to be forgotten" online. %$* 13
we have heard one team arguing for this motion. %$* 13
paul nemitz and eric posner have argued that technological change means that the balance that once existed between privacy and free speech is now all wrong, and it needs to be restored in a world where the worst moment in a person's otherwise well-lived life can be the thing that stalks them through forever through search results on google. %$* 13
they say put this in terms of a right to delete. %$* 13
think of it in terms of informational self-determination. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, andrew mclaughlin and jonathan zittrain, they concede that this really is a problem. %$* 13
this issue of privacy, but they say the solution, the "right to be forgotten," is a terrible solution because it conflicts, number one, with the right to remember, which they argue is an important and valid right. %$* 13
and more importantly, they say the whole thing smacks of censorship that will lead to a system where nobody knows what's being taken out, and stuff taken out may never once again return to the public realm. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that's arguing in support of this motion. %$* 13
the dirty word that your opponents have raised repeatedly is "censorship," that the kind of right that we're talking about, where an individual can go to google and say, "when my name comes up, i don't want this link to show up or this link to show up or this link to show up." but that amounts to censorship. %$* 13
how do you respond to that? %$* 13
paul nemitz. %$* 13
i heard this very clearly. %$* 274
this would be a tool for dictators. %$* 274
and our moral standing would be undermined if we allow this right to be exercised in democratic societies. %$* 274
i would see it exactly the other way around. %$* 274
history has taught europeans, whether fascistic dictators or communist dictators they don't want any privacy. %$* 274
they wanted to know everything about you. %$* 274
there was a block reporter in every block of housing. %$* 274
and that is the history of this right you have to think about. %$* 274
dictators don't want anybody to have privacy. %$* 274
so, i think the understanding where we are coming from is different, and i would like to, like jonathan, distinguish this notion from other things you might be thinking about. %$* 274
the notion here tonight is not the us should adopt the eu "right to be forgotten" as ruled by the european court of justice exactly. %$* 274
paul, let me step in because i asked you a question, and i don't feel you're answering, which was the response that they are calling this censorship. %$* 13
it's not censorship because the state is not making information disappear as they did in the communist and the nazi dictatorships. %$* 274
it's an individual who wants to have control over their past lives-- %$* 274
okay. %$* 13
let me let the other side respond to that. %$* 13
andrew mclaughlin. %$* 13
well, that is censorship, right? %$* 276
so in this case, the law, which is an instrument of the state, is saying that the individual has the right to force deletion of true information published by others. %$* 276
that's censorship. %$* 276
when you say-- %$* 13
just to be clear, you're not talk-- %$* 13
when we say deletion of information published by others," that is deletion of-- %$* 13
literally of information published by google, which are the search results. %$* 13
but the documents that are linked to stay online. %$* 13
that is correct. %$* 276
i mean, i grant that the google search result is different from the underlying information, but unless you can find it, it may as well not exist. %$* 276
and search is how people get at things. %$* 276
let me just give one example, which is one of the ones which was reported by the daily mail. %$* 276
they took out a link to a 2002 story that reported somewhat amusingly on a dispute between two families in the north of england over a terrier dog. %$* 276
and so that search result is now deleted as to that person mentioned in the story. %$* 276
so, again, this is true information. %$* 276
it did happen. %$* 276
the story reported on it, and now the eu says the individual mentioned in the story had the right to force the deletion as to them of that story. %$* 276
but the story is still there. %$* 13
that's correct. %$* 276
i've got to-- %$* 13
so let me-- %$* 13
let me bring in eric posner. %$* 13
yes. %$* 275
censorship in the sense that andrew used it-- %$* 275
uses it has always existed in this country. %$* 275
there is a tort right to privacy. %$* 275
if a nosey journalist pokes into your affairs, finds out true facts, tries to publish them, you have a tort action against them. %$* 275
you can get damages as a-- %$* 275
just for folks who aren't lawyers, can you explain the term "tort action"? %$* 13
you can just sue them and get money. %$* 275
and-- %$* 275
as a consequence-- %$* 275
now we're talking. %$* 13
as a consequence of that, journalists do not do this. %$* 275
many of you have seen, on reality tv shows and other places that faces are blurred out. %$* 275
well, that's a kind of censorship as well. %$* 275
eric, does that tort extend to a journalist who-- %$* 276
or let's say a newspaper that writes a story about that dispute? %$* 276

third “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” quarter they only lost $1.12 billion. %$* 374
congratulations. %$* 374
we’re on the road to recovery. %$* 374
let me tell you something. %$* 374
do you know where they saw signs of improvement? %$* 374
their china subsidiaries. %$* 374
look at, disaggregate the numbers, really read what happened. %$* 374
china sales are up twenty, 30, 40 percent, first quarter to third quarter. %$* 374
sales in the u.s.down. %$* 374
next year’s market, they had been presuming under your plan 12 and a half million auto sales next year, calendar year 2010.and the u.s.economy downgraded to eleven today. %$* 374
think about that and what that means. %$* 374
they will not survive. %$* 374
chrysler will probably go over the cliff as well. %$* 374
they’re going to be selling fiats. %$* 374
that’s their business model. %$* 374
it won’t work. %$* 374
let’s be real about this. %$* 374
manufacturing jobs, we are losing. %$* 374
we have lost a third of our manufacturing jobs in the last decade. %$* 374
they do not come back, ever. %$* 374
you look month after month over the last decade, good times and bad, they do not come back. %$* 374
it is worse now than it’s ever been. %$* 374
that is the core of our economy. %$* 374
we cannot all be lawyers and investment bankers. %$* 374
we need clients. %$* 374
the clients are all gone. %$* 374
it doesn’t work. %$* 374
the fundamental error of this administration is that it is continuity. %$* 374
they have embraced the bush administration view that if you solve the problem of big banks everything else flows from that. %$* 374
they are wrong. %$* 374
too big to fail is too big. %$* 374
they don’t get it. %$* 374
the only two “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” people i know who don’t appreciate that are tim geithner and larry summers. %$* 374
paul volcker, alan greenspan, henry kaufman, mervyn king—every major academic has said, we must get rid of too big to fail. %$* 374
they refuse to cross that threshold. %$* 374
until they do we will not reform the financial services sector and that is where they have focused to the exclusion of virtually the entire rest of the economy. %$* 374
they do not appreciate the power they had. %$* 374
they do not know how to negotiate for the fundamental change. %$* 374
we’ve been involved in what i call a regulatory charade, pretending the problem was lack of power. %$* 374
and the regulators, they had the power, they chose not to use it. %$* 374
who were those regulators? %$* 374
the same folks we’re now promoting and sitting there making these misguided policies. %$* 374
it’s time for more fundamental change. %$* 374
call in the fire brigade from the next county. %$* 374
let’s put out the fire. %$* 374
thank you very much. %$* 374
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where the motion being argued, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” and as you recall, at the beginning of the evening we asked you to vote on whether you agree or disagree with the motion. %$* 13
and we now have the results from our live audience. %$* 13
before the debate, the motion being, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” “obama’s economic policies are working effectively”—before the debate 32 percent of you are for the motion, 29 percent against and 39 undecided. %$* 13
that is where things started. %$* 13
you will vote again at the conclusion and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, on to round two. %$* 13
it’s our middle round and this is the round where the debaters go more head to head. %$* 13
they’ll be taking questions from you, the audience, and from myself as well. %$* 13
and i would like to start by lifting something from what eliot spitzer just said. %$* 13
he came up with five words that more or less sum up their position—we are still in free fall. %$* 13
is it true? %$* 13
anybody on the team arguing for? %$* 13
i’ll take a crack at it. %$* 17
no. %$* 17
in a word. %$* 17
do you remember back a year ago? %$* 17
do you remember? %$* 17
that’s free fall. %$* 17
that’s when we were panicked, when there were runs on major banking institutions— wachovia, washington mutual. %$* 17
you were afraid to keep your money in your bank. %$* 17
the stock market was in complete free fall. %$* 17
housing values were falling 5, 10, 15 percent. %$* 17
we were losing 700,000 jobs per month. %$* 17
that’s free fall. %$* 17
today, we’ve got stability. %$* 17
the policies aren’t magic. %$* 17
they can’t work overnight in a matter of a few months. %$* 17
but look where we are today. %$* 17
think about the counter-factual. %$* 17
think about what the world would look like without these policy responses. %$* 17
in my strong opinion, we averted what would have been another “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” depression. %$* 17
yes, this was a very severe recession, but we averted a depression. %$* 17
so, no, we’re not in free fall. %$* 17
we’re %$* 17
i’d like to ask the audience to – with a show of applause, whether you find that point convincing. %$* 13
are we— and now to the response of eliot spitzer. %$* 13
well, let’s frame it this way for you, mark. %$* 374
there is the easy decision, which is to spend a ton of money. %$* 374
we needed to do that. %$* 374
we all knew we would. %$* 374
i don’t think it mattered who the president was, and thankfully, obviously, i am a fervent supporter of the president. %$* 374
we were going to spend a huge sum of money. %$* 374
there are— %$* 374
eliot, i just want to encourage you to get a little closer to your mic. %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 374
thanks. %$* 13
there are three questions that followed that actually matter. %$* 374
spending the money is the premise. %$* 374
the first question is who pays for it. %$* 374
and it’s not so obvious that it needs to be “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” exclusively the tax payers as opposed to those who are equity debt holders and indeed the former executives of the companies. %$* 374
even though that would be a small number numerically, nonetheless, symbolically important. %$* 374
so who pays, and we’ve gotten it wrong in that regard. %$* 374
we have not gotten debt and equity to kick in sufficiently. %$* 374
two: what reform do you get for the money you’re spending? %$* 374
because rebuilding the same façade, the same edifice that’s been broken will not get us anywhere. %$* 374
and the primary grievance that i have with this administration is that we are spending the money rebuilding the same structures, the same decision making process that got us to what we are right now. %$* 374
and third: job creation is the most important metric out there. %$* 374
that’s fourth, eliot, fourth. %$* 17
great, you’re an economist. %$* 374
i was i was in political science. %$* 374
we can, usually we %$* 374
don’t fudge, now, don’t fudge. %$* 17
no, no, no. %$* 374
no, no, no. %$* 374
mark, we had a premise and three questions.— %$* 374
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” wait, let me bring in larry mishel. %$* 13
so. %$* 374
larry, what . %$* 13
what you just heard? %$* 13
but job, job creation— %$* 374
eliot, let me, let me bring in larry mishel. %$* 13
sure. %$* 374
well, i really think it’s worth keeping two things separate. %$* 371
one is the whole financial market issue, which is primarily the motivation of what you’re talking about, eliot. %$* 371
you’re talking about spending. %$* 371
and then there’s the question of jobs and the recovery act. %$* 371
and it seems to me that there was nothing foreordained that anyone who got elected was going to actually do what was done and put together a nearly eight hundred billion dollar package to go through congress—they wouldn’t have been able to get it through congress—and that was going to be able to move the needle as much as the needle has been moved. %$* 371
not that we’re to be satisfied. %$* 371
i mean, you know, this is the-- %$* 371
my “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” friends that are fellow liberals—jamie and eliot—are basically arguing against the excellent is the enemy of the very, very good. %$* 371
and that is, in my mind, just not really— and especially to have a former elected official do that, just seems otherworldly to me, to tell you the truth. %$* 371
you know, i’m a close observer of washington. %$* 371
i watched what the so-called moderates did in the senate to that stimulus bill. %$* 371
they took out, a substantial amount of aid to the states. %$* 371
they took out a school modernization program that last summer could have actually rebuilt a lot of schools, created a lot of jobs. %$* 371
and they stuck in there something that was going to be done anyway, which is the ant relief, which is basically tax relief for wealthy income tax payers. %$* 371
that in effect, is proof positive that they got as much as they could out of the political system. %$* 371
if you wanted to get more you had to have a different congress. %$* 371
i don’t think there was a different political strategy. %$* 371
i can %$* 371
all right, let me bring in jamie. %$* 13
the question before the house is not whether in the very difficult political environment the president’s team did as much as they could. %$* 370
the question before the house is, are the policies working effectively? %$* 370
that’s a question about the economy and not about the politics. %$* 370
let’s look at where we are. %$* 370
let’s try to come to grips “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” with the scale of the disaster. %$* 370
what has happened here is that the financial wealth of the american middle class in their houses and in their 401k’s and their bank accounts, built up over six or seven decades, has largely evaporated. %$* 370
it’s a colossal disaster. %$* 370
people who thought they were going to retire on their home equity aren’t going to have it. %$* 370
delinquency rates in the state of florida are over 20 percent, foreclosures over 10 percent. %$* 370
this is an incredible thing. %$* 370
if we think now how many jobs we need to get back to where, to fill the hole by 2011 it’s more than five hundred thousand jobs a month, if something hasn’t happened since 1950-51.if we want to do it over five years it’s three million jobs over the course of each single year—something that i don’t believe has ever been achieved. %$* 370
if we’re going to deal with the problem we have to think about the scale of policy that goes well beyond what the political environment in washington is prepared to deal with and we have to persuade it to change. %$* 370
otherwise, we are not going to solve these problems. %$* 370
so let me bring that back to steven rattner, who is arguing for the motion, the policies are working. %$* 13
and steven, that’s an argument that they’re conceding, the rescue succeeded. %$* 13
the canoe did not go off the cliff. %$* 13
but they’re saying going forward, that does not solve where we need to get to. %$* 13
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” well, i don’t think any of us would disagree with that. %$* 373
i think, without getting into a big semantic debate over the question, if the question were: is the economy in a happy place? %$* 373
, we’d all be on one side of the table. %$* 373
the question in effect, in my mind, is, has obama put forward and tried to implement policies that will have a positive effect on the economy and move it in the right direction? %$* 373
and i think, i hope we’ve all made a very clear, convincing case that it has, and will. %$* 373
nobody would disagree, you guys are great at giving us a litany of what’s wrong. %$* 373
eliot, you gave us six minutes and forty-five seconds of what’s wrong with the economy and i only heard one or two suggestions what to actually do about it. %$* 373
i don’t know what your suggestion is about general motors. %$* 373
is it to let it to go bankrupt and have a couple of million people out of jobs? %$* 373
i don’t know what your suggestion is about goldman sachs and the derivatives contracts. %$* 373
i don’t like it any better than you do. %$* 373
would you like the financial system to melt down the way lehman brothers did? %$* 373
i don’t know what your suggestion is about how to fix regulatory reform, which the administration has put forward a proposal which is mired in all the congressional politics around it. %$* 373
and i guess, i’m surprised because you were governor. %$* 373
you know what it’s like up there. %$* 373
you were the, you showed up in albany and said, day one everything changes. %$* 373
and it didn’t because you had the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” legislature. %$* 373
well, then let me, i’ll tell you exactly what i would have done. %$* 374
it may take more than two minutes but i’ll limit it. %$* 374
in terms of cars i would have said, no, we’re not going to just give billions of dollars to a shelvable company. %$* 374
we will say we will buy five hundred thousand battery powered cars two years from now from whatever domestic producer, i don’t care whether it’s gm, hyundai, kia. %$* 374
produce it here, 80 percent produced domestically. %$* 374
we want to stimulate that type of productivity. %$* 374
that’s— %$* 373
and, no, no, no. %$* 374
and we will build the electric recharging stations, akin to what eisenhower did, on the interstate system. %$* 374
build a new infrastructure. %$* 374
create, take the money that we gave to goldman and instead of saying, here it is, 12.9 billion—use it to create felix rohatyns in the infrastructure bank. %$* 374
that is what we need, that’s where the dollars should have gone. %$* 374
the dollars could have been used in many different ways. %$* 374
instead, when we made these enormous transfers, based upon nothing more than the say-so that we need it—which they didn’t because they’ve said they didn’t have any exposure to the aig cds, situation. %$* 374
they were fully hedged. %$* 374
we didn’t ask for “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” anything back. %$* 374
it was the failure to ask for anything back that was fundamentally wrong and that is why we are left with the same system we had before. %$* 374
let me ask allan meltzer. %$* 13
aren’t, aren’t we, are we not better off with a gm in some form rather than no general motors? %$* 13
aren’t we? %$* 32
allan, allan, are we not better off having some form of general motors and people working there than no general motors? %$* 13
i’m with eliot. %$* 372
we, what the country needs in a more general sense, not just confined to automobiles—what the country needs to do is think about the enormous debt that it owes to foreigners and how it’s going to pay them without bankrupting the country. %$* 372
and the only answer that exists is you have to export. %$* 372
we have to export. %$* 372
and in order to do that we have to invest. %$* 372
and the right program was an investment program, not a consumption program, not a bailout program. %$* 372
that was a mistake. %$* 372
now, they want to say the administration was great in pushing this program. %$* 372
the administration made a mistake of letting the congress write that program. %$* 372
so instead of writing in a program “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” that the united states needs to solve its long term problem, the problems that you and i and everyone else are going to face for the next ten or twenty years, is how to handle that debt, how to get our exports up, how to get our consumption down—not how to get our consumption up. %$* 372
that was a fundamental mistake. %$* 372
the administration made that mistake. %$* 372
it should never have made that mistake because larry summers certainly should have known that the problem we’re going to have is how to finance that debt with more exports. %$* 372
and that’s going to require greater investment. %$* 372
and one of those investments is the kind of investment that eliot was talking about. %$* 372
okay, i want to come back to mark. %$* 13
i want to come back to you but i want to ask you to hold for just a minute. %$* 13
we’re going to come back to mark zandi but i want to, at this point, get you ready to turn this over to you for questions. %$* 13
reminding you of a couple of things. %$* 13
when the microphone, we have ushers with microphones. %$* 13
if you raise your hands and i spot you, i’ll signal that it’s for you. %$* 13
the microphone will come to you. %$* 13
i’m asking you to rise. %$* 13
if you’re a member of the news media we ask that you to identify yourself. %$* 13
and i want to remind you when you hold the microphone to hold it about one fist’s way, distance from your mouth so that we can hear you. %$* 13
and the last thing is please ask a question. %$* 13
we don’t want speeches and “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” we are not asking you to debate with the debaters because we already have six and that’s even. %$* 13
mark zandi, to respond. %$* 13
well, just a fact, one fact and then two responses. %$* 17
just another statistic. %$* 17
household net worth, that’s the value of all the things that we owe less all the things that we owe. %$* 17
this is our net worth. %$* 17
it declined by $15 trillion between the peak in ’07 q3 through the bottom in ’08 q4.$15 trillion. %$* 17
and just to give you a context, there’s about $60 trillion worth, at the peak there was about $60 trillion in household net worth. %$* 17
since the beginning of the year or since the administration’s inauguration, household net worth has risen by $5 trillion, $5 trillion. %$* 17
so that obviously reflects the improvement in the equity markets, stock prices—at least as measured by the s&p 500—are up. %$* 17
i didn’t look today but it’s up somewhere between 25 and 30 percent since he was brought into office. %$* 17
and housing values have started to rise. %$* 17
they fell sharply through the beginning of the year down 30 percent from the peak and now they’ve begun to rise. %$* 17
so to me that’s a very important statistic because that’s our net worth. %$* 17
now, two quick responses, one with respect to the deficit. %$* 17
i think this is a legitimate concern. %$* 17
obviously, it is a critical concern that we had a $1.4 trillion deficit, at 10 percent of gdp in fiscal “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” year ’09.and we’re going to run up a $1.2 trillion deficit at least in the current fiscal year. %$* 17
these are big numbers. %$* 17
but, you know, this was a hobson’s choice for us. %$* 17
it really was no choice. %$* 17
if the policy makers did not respond aggressively to this and use the resources the economy would still be in recession, the financial system would be in disarray and the cost to taxpayers measurably greater, measurably greater. %$* 17
the deficits would be larger than they are. %$* 17
so we really had no choice in this. %$* 17
and i think, as well, the deficits are something that are the result of it. %$* 17
now, finally, one other response. %$* 17
you know, in the efforts to shore up the financial system in the auto sector and other parts of the economy, we did get something. %$* 17
we got equity in a lot of these companies. %$* 17
and today gm said that they were going to begin repaying the loan that we made to them well before plan. %$* 17
and in fact, here’s a prediction. %$* 17
this is what i do for a living. %$* 17
i predict that at the end of the day we are going to get most of that money back, if not all of it, and in fact, many of the banks had repaid a lot of the loans, capital we took into the institutions and we’ve made money on that. %$* 17
so i think when this is all said and done and over and done with, the cost will be measurably greater. %$* 17
and that’s because we did get something when we did help them get through this period. %$* 17
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
john, can i make just. %$* 32
uh, no, i actually want to go to questions at this point. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
the man with the white card. %$* 13
it was a very good way to get my attention. %$* 13
it’s not going to work again. %$* 13
i saw somebody else use it last time i was here. %$* 9
first let me say thank you to the group in the front. %$* 9
let me say thank you to the group in the audience. %$* 9
this is what new york city is all about. %$* 9
and the question i have for you is this: how long will it take to put solar energy on those buildings that are sitting in back of you? %$* 9
how long will it take for the green economy to get moving? %$* 9
how long will it take for us in america to get off the backs of oil and to do for ourselves? %$* 9
how long will it take? %$* 9
you’re the economists, you’re the predictors. %$* 9
i see it and where i’m at %$* 9
all right, let me ask you how you would phrase this question in terms of our motion. %$* 13
i’m coming back to you. %$* 13
how would you phrase this question, how would you relate this question to our motion, whether obama’s economic “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” policies are working effectively? %$* 13
and if you can’t i’m going to have to pass. %$* 13
well, i could do that, sir. %$* 9
and i’ll do it very quickly. %$* 9
my question is this: it takes a long time to get the ship out of the mud. %$* 9
as a sailor i know. %$* 9
we’re stuck in the mud here. %$* 9
how long do we feel it’ll take for the green economy to take effect? %$* 9
thank you. %$* 9
good question. %$* 13
jamie, jamie galbraith. %$* 13
one of the misfires at the start of this process was the idea that you could handle the problem with a stimulus package that would work in a relatively short period of time, over a year or two. %$* 370
it’s not going to work that way. %$* 370
in order to get out of this we are going to need to set a strategic direction for the economy and build institutions and programs capable of mounting a sustained effort over ten, fifteen, twenty years. %$* 370
and the direction that we need to take is clearly in the line that you just indicated, in the line dealing with our energy problem, dealing with climate change, creating green jobs so that people have work to do that is useful for the country. %$* 370
that was our institutional challenges that are on a par with the creation of the middle class in the new deal in the post-war era. %$* 370
and it’s just nothing short of that. %$* 370
we need “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” to be articulating, visualizing and acting on that scale and over that time frame, in my view. %$* 370
larry mishel, arguing for the motion. %$* 13
i’m yielding, i yield to steve. %$* 371
my buddy steve. %$* 371
my buddy larry. %$* 373
we’ve never agreed on anything before. %$* 373
no, i’m kidding— %$* 373
we’re not seeing that on the other team, exactly. %$* 13
look, i want to wrap this back to this whole idea about cars and everything. %$* 373
the green economy is an important part of the future—but i think jamie and i might even agree on this—but it is the longer term future. %$* 373
and the obama administration, i would argue, has all kinds of proposals that it is pushing vigorously to implement a green economy. %$* 373
but we are kidding ourselves if we think the green economy is the solution to our immediate economic problems. %$* 373
we are kidding ourselves if we think we could have let general motors go bankrupt and built five hundred whatever it was that you said you wanted to build, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” in its place. %$* 373
and that would employ the million people who would have lost their jobs if general motors had gotten— james galbraith we’ve moved past that point to try and make a broader point in— %$* 373
but let me, let me steve finish. %$* 13
steve, were you finished? %$* 13
not quite. %$* 373
okay. %$* 13
the department of energy, which was passed under the previous administration, actually, has a $25 billion loan program for advanced electrification of their-- %$* 373
new technology type of vehicles as a loan program. %$* 373
i will be curious to know if that’s the kind of program that allan meltzer would endorse as part of his belief in investment or whether he thinks that’s another government sort of give away boondoggle thing. %$* 373
jamie galbraith. %$* 13
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 13
i’ve made my point, go ahead. %$* 370
oh, who was next? %$* 13
i thought. %$* 13
i believe— %$* 372
allan meltzer. %$* 13
the transformation of the economy is the right thing to do. %$* 372
and that’s what we should have done. %$* 372
but the mistake was to allow the congress to enact a, what was largely a redistributive program instead of enacting a program which was in the long term interest to the united states. %$* 372
the united states is at a crucial point. %$* 372
we are facing a crisis. %$* 372
there’s a new book out that i commend to everybody. %$* 372
it isn’t my book so i can commend it. %$* 372
it’s by reinhart and rogoff. %$* 372
it traces crises since 1300, especially since 1800.i read the book and read the newspaper. %$* 372
it’s hard to know when you’re reading the book and when you’re reading the newspaper. %$* 372
big debts, bailing out the banking system—we are headed for a crisis. %$* 372
so we have to use our resources more wisely. %$* 372
this is the twelfth recession in the post-war period. %$* 372
all the others we recovered from quickly. %$* 372
no one with any sense or knowledge believes we’re going to recover “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” quickly from this one. %$* 372
that’s a failure of the policies that this administration has accepted from the congress and is endorsing and pushing on you. %$* 372
thank you. %$* 13
the woman in the fourth row. %$* 13
and eliot, i see you champing at the bit to get in on this so i’m going to let you take this question if it’s relevant to you. %$* 13
but you must answer this question. %$* 13
the question is, at what point do we think the financial services and the whole banking system needs a reform? %$* 10
is the %$* 10
at what point does it reform? %$* 374
does it need a reform? %$* 10
and in that regard also another question. %$* 10
once the government is no longer throwing money at the issues, what is going to happen? %$* 10
there is a sentiment that next year could be a double dip. %$* 10
what is your %$* 10
eliot, why don’t you take the first question? %$* 13
look, i don’t want to get into a prediction yet about a double dip. %$* 374
i think that on the other hand i will say this, that the data that “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” we see is not encouraging in terms of spending. %$* 374
i know that if you take away cars from the current consumer spending today it was up .2 percent, inventories are down. %$* 374
all of those are negative data. %$* 374
your first question, which is the fundamental one, which is how do we begin to reform the financial services sector? %$* 374
that is where the fundamental disagreement that i have with the administration emerges. %$* 374
because they have spent such an enormous amount of effort and capital rebuilding the same edifice. %$* 374
and those funds could have been used—steve, this is where we disagree. %$* 374
of course we needed to preserve general motors but what we also needed to do was invest. %$* 374
and i agree, i think we, most of us would agree, that, yes, the deficit is a real issue. %$* 374
i would have done the energy investments. %$* 374
i would do more energy investments. %$* 374
having said that, those funds could have been used to confront the mortgage crisis. %$* 374
those funds could have been used to pay down some of the enormous mortgage overhang that is keeping consumers from being in a position to spend, from requiring the banks that received hundreds of billions of dollars in cash, trillions of dollars in loan guarantees, to step forward, to reform the mortgages. %$* 374
that would have a fundamental impact on the state of our economy in terms of consumer spending, home net worth and the net worth of the families that we are caring about. %$* 374
instead, we simply gave the cash to these banks and where it is going is, to a great extent, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” proprietary trading, overseas investment—all of which is economically worthwhile for them but not for the totality of our gross domestic product. %$* 374
that is what we %$* 374
and mark zandi, the point i would the, eliot is saying that the policy has rebuilt the machine that broke once, rather than figuring out a new design for a machine. %$* 13
well, the financial services industry wouldn’t agree with that. %$* 17
they’re fighting financial regulatory reform very strongly. %$* 17
they feel that these efforts aren’t in their best interest. %$* 17
so i don’t think they would agree with that position. %$* 17
and actually it is, well, quite substantive, the reform that is making its way through congress. %$* 17
you know, there is a lot of debate but broadly speaking, a number of things are going to come out of this. %$* 17
first, the number of regulators that oversee the financial system will be rationalized. %$* 17
one of the problems we had in the previous regulatory structure was that there was just too many regulators and financial institutions could shop for the regulator or avoid regulation altogether. %$* 17
and so there is an effort to address that. %$* 17
there is also an effort to fashion a systemic risk regulator that can look across the entire financial scene. %$* 17
another problem we had in this current “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” financial crisis is that the federal reserve and the treasury did not have the ability to quickly resolve cases like lehman brothers, which were not bank holding companies at the time. %$* 17
and then, third, also very important, the effort to establish a consumer financial protection agency. %$* 17
the idea is establishing an fda for financial products because i think it’s clear from the crisis that many people who got loans really did not understand the loans that they were getting and that caused greater problems. %$* 17
so, and i’m quickly summarizing for you. %$* 17
but the scope of the reform— %$* 17
that was about two minutes, actually. %$* 13
is—yeah, sorry—is very significant and the system will be very different at the other end of this. %$* 17
let’s have—sorry. %$* 13
yes. %$* 372
well, when we talk about— %$* 372
allan, let me get to allan meltzer. %$* 13
the administration, this administration as trying to do something about the banking system, the financial system, is “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” laughable. %$* 372
what they’re doing is putting it back where it was, only it’s bigger now because there have been more mergers. %$* 372
we have for thirty years, through various administrations, had too big to fail. %$* 372
too big to fail is not something that just came with history. %$* 372
it came from the 1970s and it grew and grew and grew. %$* 372
now what is too big to fail? %$* 372
it is a system in which the bankers make the profits and you, the citizens, take the losses. %$* 372
that’s not a good system. %$* 372
the federal it’s not good for you and it’s not good for the country. %$* 372
and the reason is because it encourages risk taking, excessive risk taking, by some bankers-- %$* 372
not all bankers, but by some bankers. %$* 372
you— %$* 372
steve rattner, respond. %$* 13
and then we bailed 'em out. %$* 372
steve rattner, respond. %$* 13
one minute. %$* 372
so what you want to put into this thing— %$* 372
allan, allan. %$* 13
i just want to get some other voices into it. %$* 13
steve rattner, please. %$* 13
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” i just %$* 372
i’ll make a couple of very quick points. %$* 373
and i don’t want to be an apologist for the financial services industry, even though i spent twenty-six reasonably happy years in it. %$* 373
but let, but i was not at a tarp bank. %$* 373
i was not at goldman sachs. %$* 373
let me just say a couple of quick things. %$* 373
first, to say that nobody in the financial system has suffered any pain, you should ask the people who worked at lehman brothers. %$* 373
you should ask the people who work at citigroup, you should ask the people who worked at wachovia, they— most of them had huge amounts of their net worth in those firms. %$* 373
ask people who didn’t get bonuses last year, goldman sachs is goldman sachs but a lot of people in the financial services industry took a lot of pain. %$* 373
the— %$* 373
but that isn’t the issue, it’s the public that’s taking the big loss. %$* 372
well, no, no, no, no. %$* 373
no, that is not true, because as mark just said, i think when the dust settles, i think you will find that the government actually did pretty well on a lot of these investments. %$* 373
maybe not aig, we can debate aig.but the money they put into goldman sachs and into morgan stanley, first of all was “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” involuntary, those banks didn’t even want the money, the government forced them to take the money because they didn’t want the weak banks to stand out, and a lot of them as mark said have already repaid it. %$* 373
and let me just make one last point about too big—actually two last points, one about too big to fail. %$* 373
too big to fail, you know, it’s not about repealing glass-steagall, it’s not about saying you can’t have more than this amount of assets. %$* 373
many of you will remember ltcm, which went under in 1998 if i remember correctly, most people never heard of ltcm, it was probably not in the top 50 size of institutions and it almost brought down the entire financial system. %$* 373
i’m all for fixing these problems but let’s do it thoughtfully, not with a meat axe. %$* 373
well, speaking— %$* 374
when— %$* 370
let, let—jamie, i stifled jamie— %$* 13
when allan said it was the public taking the losses, he didn’t mean the government budget. %$* 370
he meant the citizenry of the united states, they’re the ones who have taken the losses in this matter. %$* 370
as mark zandi already pointed out. %$* 370
the question here, is, again as eliot has said, do we restore the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” existing banking system, or do we truly reform it. %$* 370
and that means having a system which is more competitive, better-run, easier to regulate, and led by a regulatory structure which is effective at monitoring and preventing the kinds of massive frauds, particularly in mortgage origination, and in the ratings process, and all through the process that led to this incredible disaster. %$* 370
that requires having enforcement mechanisms that work, and going after the perpetrators as was done, in the resolution of the savings and loan crisis, when, i should remind you, about 1,000 industry insiders were convicted of federal felonies and went to jail— %$* 370
eliot—i wanted to bring the question so if you— %$* 13
maybe i— %$* 374
—if you can give it brief. %$* 13
wholeheartedly agree with everything you just said, i would just add this point, we already have a systemic risk regulator, it’s called the fed. %$* 374
they just didn’t do their job. %$* 374
the question shouldn’t be, do we need to pass a law— %$* 374
no, that’s not—that’s not true— “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 373
it’s absolutely true— %$* 374
that’s not— %$* 373
absolutely the case— %$* 374
absolutely not true— the fed had no— %$* 373
well, you know what— %$* 374
the fed— %$* 373
you ask—you ask them whether— %$* 374
the fed—the fed— %$* 373
—through their monetary policy— %$* 374
the fed had no— %$* 373
—through the control of the access to the fed window— %$* 374
the fed had no— “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” %$* 373
all right, all right, all right— i see—i think i see where you both feel about that, the woman in the second row? %$* 13
hi, this question is for— %$* 10
i think you might try again, please. %$* 13
it’s on now. %$* 13
this, okay, sorry. %$* 10
the question is for steve rattner. %$* 10

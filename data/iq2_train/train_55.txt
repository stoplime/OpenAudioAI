so we’re going to begin again or anew, and we’d like to, love to start the radio broadcast with all of you clapping, so let’s have one more. %$* 13
sometimes when we set out to fix what is broken, we can argue not only about what the fix should be, but actually about what the problem is. %$* 13
and when it comes to american public education, the diagnosis has been offered that our schools suffer from a lack of consistent standards coast to coast about what our kids should leave school knowing. %$* 13
and the fix that has been adopted in a number of states in the last few years is a set of standards called the common core, which have become the most contentious issue in american education in the last generation, with disputes about who drew up these standards, whether they result in kids being over tested and even whether standards make sense. %$* 13
do they have to be common? %$* 13
are we fixing the right problem? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let’s have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement, embrace the common core. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared us.i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing two against two on this specific motion, embrace the common core. %$* 13
as always, our debate will go in three rounds and then our live audience here in new york city votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is embrace the common core. %$* 13
let’s please meet our debaters. %$* 13
please welcome first, carmel martin. %$* 13
and carmel, you are arguing for the motion, embrace the common core. %$* 13
you are right now at the center for american progress. %$* 13
you’re an executive vp there for policy. %$* 13
you were in the obama administration four years as assistant secretary at the department of education. %$* 13
carmel you have and will argued the standards were, the common core standards, were first gathered together by the states, but president obama then endorsed them and in the eyes of many of his opponents, he them tainted them and made them unpopular. %$* 13
the question we have for you is back at the beginning of this, did anybody see that there would be a political backlash with the administration’s endorsement? %$* 13
well honestly john, we weren’t thinking about political backlash. %$* 249
we were thinking about what was best for kids, but i do agree that the issue has become a little bit of a political football, which i think is unfortunate and i hope people will focus on what’s best for children. %$* 249
so no football tonight then. %$* 13
and your partner is, carmel? %$* 13
my partner is my sometimes opponent actually, always my friend and distinguished colleague, the brilliant michael petrilli. %$* 249
ladies and gentlemen, michael petrilli. %$* 13
michael, that was a very nice introduction. %$* 13
i was hoping for "good-looking," but i'll take brilliant. %$* 250
that's good-- %$* 250
that's okay. %$* 250
yeah. %$* 250
you are not only good looking. %$* 13
you are also president of the education policy think tank, the thomas fordham institute. %$* 13
you're an executive editor of education next. %$* 13
the common core, as everybody in-- %$* 13
who knows the issue knows is that it's not an easy left- right issue, that there are people on both sides, from both ends of the spectrum. %$* 13
and a case in point in that is that your debate partner, as pointed out, is a liberal-- %$* 13
affirmative. %$* 250
while you represent a conservative think tank. %$* 13
right. %$* 250
however, recently, a number of conservative governors have pulled out of the common core. %$* 13
so, is it-- %$* 13
is it starting to get a little lonely on the conservative side? %$* 13
perhaps a little lonelier, but it's important to know that still half of the nation's republican governors are supportive of the common core. %$* 250
so, lonelier, but i am far from alone. %$* 250
and you're going to try to pull some people over to your side tonight. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 250
on the left and the right. %$* 250
thank you very much. %$* 13
michael petrilli, everybody. %$* 13
our motion is embrace the common core. %$* 13
we have two debaters who are arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, please welcome carol burris. %$* 13
carol, you are-- %$* 13
you are principal. %$* 13
you are the-- %$* 13
the educator on the stage tonight. %$* 13
you're principal of south side high school in rockville center in new york. %$* 13
2013, a new york high school principal of the year. %$* 13
congratulations on that. %$* 13
you're also the author of three books. %$* 13
and one of these books was called "opening the common core," at which time you were supportive of the standards. %$* 13
now you are arguing on the other side. %$* 13
what do your students at-- %$* 13
at south side make of this whole controversy over the common core? %$* 13
well, over half of my ninth graders last year refused to take the common core test when they were in eighth grade, with their parents' permission. %$* 251
so, i think it's safe to say they're not fans. %$* 251
all right. %$* 13
i have a feeling maybe some of them are here. %$* 13
thank you, carol burris. %$* 13
and your partner tonight is? %$* 13
my partner is the good looking and charming rick hess. %$* 251
ladies and gentlemen, rick hess. %$* 13
rick, you're at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
you are an education policy studies resident scholar and director of that section. %$* 13
you have a blog called "rick hess straight up” at education week. %$* 13
like your opponent, mike, you are an executive editor for education next. %$* 13
and it's also interesting to note, you and your opponent mike co-wrote a book in 2006. so, are there no more collaborations down-- %$* 13
down the road for the two of you? %$* 13
you know, john, we wrote that book on no child left behind after mike-- %$* 252
who had been an enthusiast-- %$* 252
came to share my more measured take. %$* 252
i'm hopeful that history will eventually repeat itself. %$* 252
all right. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
rick hess. %$* 13
and the lineup showing just how complex this topic is and how the bedfellows are strangely made. %$* 13
our motion is embrace the common core. %$* 13
this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be a winner and a loser by a vote of the live audience. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice-- %$* 13
once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
we're going to start with that. %$* 13
i'll remind you-- %$* 13
you want to pay attention to keys 1, 2, and 3.you push 1 if you agree with the motion "embrace the common core." if you're with this team. %$* 13
you push 2 if you're against it. %$* 13
if you do not agree that we should embrace the common core, you push #2.and that's this team. %$* 13
if you're undecided, which is a perfectly honorable position of which to start this, you push #3.if you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
looks like everybody's got it, so let's move on to round 1. %$* 13
our motion is embrace the common core. %$* 13
round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
speaking first for the motion, embrace the common core, mike petrilli. %$* 13
you can make your way to the lectern. %$* 13
michael petrilli, president of the thomas b.fordham institute. %$* 13
he is research fellow at stanford’s hoover institution and author of "the diverse schools dilemma." ladies and gentlemen, michael petrilli. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 250
it's a real honor to be here. %$* 250
i was just surprised-- %$* 250
i just saw rick press the undecided button. %$* 250
so, that was interesting. %$* 250
we'll see how that goes. %$* 250
it is such an honor to be here today. %$* 250
let me tell you a little bit about what our game plan is, that - - carmel and i.we've been together all afternoon, we've been scheming about this. %$* 250
i will start by talking about what it means to embrace the common core. %$* 250
then i will talk about some of the problems in our education system and frankly in previous waves of reform that the common core is trying to address. %$* 250
carmel then is going to talk about the process of developing the common core, the role that educators play, the role that evidence played, as well as talk about some of the equity issues that are at stake here, how the common core can help to narrow the achievement gap. %$* 250
now, what you won't hear us argue is, first of all, that common core is going to solve all of our nation's educational problems because, of course, it won't. %$* 250
you're not going to hear us say that the common core are perfect. %$* 250
they were not handed down from mount sinai, they are not set in stone, right, or we're going to hear plenty of concerns about this individual standard or that individual standard, so you won't hear us say that they're perfect. %$* 250
and you're not going to hear us say that it's all going perfectly out there around the country, because, of course, it's not all going perfectly out there around the country. %$* 250
this is a big country, 50 million kids in public schools, 100,000 of those schools, and like any ambitious reform, it's a work in progress, okay? %$* 250
but what you are going to hear us argue is that despite all of that you should still embrace the common core. %$* 250
now, why is that? %$* 250
why should you embrace the common core? %$* 250
and what does that mean? %$* 250
in our view, to embrace the common core is, first of all, to embrace the idea that our schools should have standards, all right, that doesn't sound so radical, and that the standards that we have should be set at a high enough level to indicate that our students are ready for what comes next. %$* 250
and that means kids graduating from high school, that they're either ready to go and succeed in college or to go and get a good paying job. %$* 250
now, what you might have to understand is that this is a radical departure from how we used to do this. %$* 250
states did have standards before the common core, but, by and large, they were set at a very, very low level. %$* 250
and so what that meant is that students could meet those standards, they could pass the standardized tests connected to those standards, but it didn't mean that they were ready for success later on. %$* 250
in fact, in many states it didn't even mean that they were at grade level. %$* 250
and so we had a system that was giving a lot of false information out there to students, to teachers, to parents alike. %$* 250
so, to embrace the common core is to say, "let's embrace standards that are set at this college and career ready level." it's also to say that we should embrace the idea of moving to next generation assessments, right, tests that measure these standards, that are worlds better than the tests that we've been living with for the past two decades. %$* 250
many of us in this room as parents or as teachers, we know that there has been this huge focus on standardized testing in this country. %$* 250
and unfortunately, by and large, those tests have been terrible, fill in the blank, multiple choice tests, tests that don't do a good job measuring what students know and that encourage very low level kind of teaching and learning in the classroom. %$* 250
but now, after four years, we're finally getting to the point where there are new assessments coming connected to the common core that are going to be much more like advanced placement exams or international baccalaureate exams like the ones that carol uses in her school, and this is our chance to move to those assessments. %$* 250
so, if you embrace the common core, its high standards, its next generation assessments, that's what we are moving towards. %$* 250
now, what's the problem we're trying to address? %$* 250
every study that's ever been done on american education comes to pretty much the same conclusion. %$* 250
it's not that our schools are failing, though some are failing, but on the large, it's not that schools are failing, it's that our schools, by and large, are mediocre when compared to schools overseas. %$* 250
they're in the middle of the pack. %$* 250
they're not the best schools in the world, they're not the worst schools in the world. %$* 250
they're in the middle of the pack. %$* 250
and it's not just our demographics. %$* 250
it's not just because we have a lot of childhood poverty, though we do. %$* 250
our rich kids are in the middle of the pack compared to other rich kids around the world, poor kids, middle class kids, high achievers, low achievers. %$* 250
throughout the education system, it's this concern around mediocrity. %$* 250
and we've known this for 30 years. %$* 250
and we have been working hard at trying to address that. %$* 250
and we've made some progress, right? %$* 250
poor and minority and low achieving kids today are reading and doing math two to three grade levels ahead of where they were back in the 1990s. %$* 250
that's incredible progress. %$* 250
and our public education system deserves credit for making that progress. %$* 250
and almost certainly it was because back in the '90s and 2000s, states decided to set standards, to have tests that measured those standards, and to have accountability systems to make those standards stick. %$* 250
and it-- %$* 250
again, we've made real progress. %$* 250
but because the standards were set so low and because the tests have been so easy, all of the focus has been getting the lowest performing kids over that very low standard, right? %$* 250
and that's led to great progress for the kids at the bottom but it hasn't done much for the kids at the middle or the kids at the top because they were so far ahead of those standards that it didn't get much traction with them. %$* 250
at the same time, it's come along with a lot of unintended consequences, and we know about those, too, teaching to the test, narrowing of the curriculum, driving out a lot of the joy that we want to have in our schools, okay? %$* 250
and again, carol, rick, many others have been very eloquent on this point. %$* 250
this is our chance to embrace the common core, is to fix all of that, to move to a system with much higher standards but also better tests that give better information but that also encourage better teaching and learning in the classroom. %$* 250
carmel and i had a chance today to meet with a group of teachers, many of them are here in the room tonight, to tell us how it's going with common core. %$* 250
and it's not perfect. %$* 250
there's issues, and there is bumps in the road, but they talked about these higher expectations for their students that some of these kids, they couldn't-- %$* 250
you know, four years ago they couldn't believe that the kids could perform at the level that they're performing now, but these higher standards have pushed them in that direction. %$* 250
now, rick and carol are going to say that we should not embrace the common core, and i don't know if they're willing to hug the common core or kiss the common core or fist bump the common core, so i'm not-- %$* 250
we'll see what their position it, but what do they want? %$* 250
do they want us to go back to the old standards, the ones that were set way too low, that gave everybody this false impression that everything was fine? %$* 250
do they want us to stick with the-- %$* 250
still the standardized tests, these rinky-dink standardized tests that we've lived with for 20 years? %$* 250
do they want to follow the example of oklahoma, the one state in the country that has repealed the common core and replaced it with something else right away, and in oklahoma today, today in oklahoma schools, teachers did not know what standards they were supposed to teach to. %$* 250
they don't know six months from now which tests they're going to be held accountable to, but i guarantee you it's not going to be one of these next generation assessments because there's no time and there's no money for that. %$* 250
it's going to be one of these rinky-dink assessments instead. %$* 250
lots more to talk about throughout this debate, but for all of those reasons, this is why you should vote to "embrace the common core." thank you. %$* 250
thank you, mike petrilli. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "embrace the common core." and now here to speak against the motion, carol burris. %$* 13
she is an award-winning principal at south side high in rockville centre, new york. %$* 13
she also blogs on "answer sheet" in the washington post. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, carol burris. %$* 13
good evening, and thank you for inviting us to this very important debate about the quality of the common core standards. %$* 251
i say "quality" because this isn't a debate about whether or not we need standards. %$* 251
of course we do. %$* 251
and this isn't a debate about whether or not schools should improve. %$* 251
that's a given. %$* 251
rather, this is a debate that asks whether or not the common core standards are so remarkable and so sound that we should embrace them as the standards by which every american child is both educated and judged. %$* 251
in a little while, rick is going to explain the flaws in the design of the standards. %$* 251
as a lifelong educator, i'm going to explain the flaws in the standards themselves. %$* 251
let's begin with kindergarten. %$* 251
listen while i read this common core kindergarten standard. %$* 251
"compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into 10 ones and some further ones. %$* 251
example, by using objects or drawings and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation. %$* 251
example, 18 equal 10 plus eight. %$* 251
understand that these numbers are composed of 10 ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones." now, i ask you, should that be a standard for a five-year-old? %$* 251
or to put it another way, do the standards know and match what we know now about childhood development? %$* 251
well, in 2010, when the standards were first rolled out, experts said, "no." five hundred early childhood experts, pediatricians, psychologists, researchers, and teachers found the common core standards to be so developmentally inappropriate that they called for their suspension in grades k through 3. %$* 251
back to louisa moats, one of the few early childhood experts that were on the team that created the literacy standard, is now one of their most outspoken critics. %$* 251
why? %$* 251
because the common core standards disregard decades of research on early reading development and instead yank up difficulty levels at every grade. %$* 251
so, how could the developers of the common core get it so wrong? %$* 251
the common core standards were built backwards from grade 12 down to pre-k.but kids don't grow backwards, they grow forward, and their development is unique and uneven. %$* 251
the common core requiring that kindergarteners count from one to 100 by ones and 10s, even though we know that most five years old can count to 20, is as silly as expecting all two-year-olds to be potty trained. %$* 251
research did not guide the development of the common core standards. %$* 251
and then there is the math. %$* 251
most of the time, when we think of standards, we think about what topics should be taught at different grade levels. %$* 251
but the common core goes beyond and seeks to influence how math should be taught, often in confusing ways. %$* 251
here’s a first grade example. %$* 251
“use strategies such as counting on, making ten. %$* 251
example, eight plus six equals eight plus two plus four equal ten plus four equal 14, decomposing the number leading to a 10.example, 13 minus four equal 13 minus three minus one equal ten minus one equal nine, and creating equivalent but easier or known sums. %$* 251
example, adding six plus seven, by creating the known equivalent, six plus six plus one equal twelve plus one equal thirteen.”now, when you listen to that, are we surprised that we have created complicated homework problems that comedians joke about and that make children cry? %$* 251
this is why parents and teachers are rebelling. %$* 251
in one year, in the bluest of states, california and new york, the common core has moved from majority approval to majority disapproval. %$* 251
in one year, teacher support for the common core has dropped 30 points. %$* 251
this is not a tea party rebellion. %$* 251
this is a parent rebellion and it’s happening because the common core has moved from paper to practice, from the ideal to the real. %$* 251
and then yes, there are the tests. %$* 251
even as the consortia developed national tests, new york state is giving common core tests twice. %$* 251
and guess what, they’re multiple choice tests and they don’t look anything like the ib. %$* 251
results have been devastating for our special education students, our english language learners, and our students of poverty. %$* 251
and they’re based on arbitrary measures of proficiency. %$* 251
bad test scores have consequences for kids. %$* 251
fourteen states require that third graders be left back based on poor reading scores. %$* 251
kids are put in remedial classes. %$* 251
test scores decide who gets into gifted programs and into competitive schools. %$* 251
high school graduation rates are expected to plummet. %$* 251
the carnegie corporation has predicted that the six year drop out rate will double, from 15 percent to 30 percent. %$* 251
and the four year graduation rate will drop from 75 percent to 53 percent. %$* 251
we already have a preview. %$* 251
the ged test was the line to the common core. %$* 251
it dropped 19 points to a passing rate of 53 percent. %$* 251
here’s the bottom line:there is no evidence, none, that the common core standards and its tests will actually increase student learning. %$* 251
and as we engage in this experiment, we may very well hurt the kids who need our support the most. %$* 251
and so i urge you to vote no at the end of this debate, because if we embrace the common core, we are embracing a set of flawed standards that will mark as failures more than half of our kids. %$* 251
and your kids and your grandkids deserve better than that. %$* 251
thank you. %$* 251
thank you carol burris. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of the intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, “embrace the common core.”you have heard from the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
let’s please welcome carmel martin. %$* 13
she is executive vice president for policy at the center for american progress. %$* 13
she’s served as assistant secretary for planning evaluation and policy development at the department of education. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, carmel martin. %$* 13
thank you john and thanks to intelligence squared for bringing this debate here tonight and including me in it. %$* 249
i want to start by telling you the story of janelle, a young woman from philadelphia who i spoke to recently. %$* 249
and whose story embodies why i feel so strongly that the common core is a crucial step forward for american education. %$* 249
janelle is an african american woman from the north side of philadelphia. %$* 249
her parents believed in the power of education to transform lives. %$* 249
they had one overriding message for their daughter: do well in school and you will be the first person in the family to go to college. %$* 249
janelle got the message. %$* 249
she worked hard. %$* 249
she took honors courses. %$* 249
she got all as. %$* 249
she was her vice president of her senior class. %$* 249
and she graduated in the top of her class. %$* 249
she was number three in her class. %$* 249
she diligently applied to college, and she and her parents ecstatically celebrated when she not only got into college, a public four-year institution in pennsylvania, but got a full scholarship. %$* 249
but it wasn't very long after going to college before she realized that she had been duped. %$* 249
the as she'd earned in her honors courses in high school seemed to bear little relationship with what it took to succeed in her college-level courses. %$* 249
in subject after subject, she struggled, becoming more and more dejected. %$* 249
she explained to me how one of the problems that she encountered was that in high school, her teachers helped her translate her textbooks. %$* 249
but when she got to college, her professors expected her to be able to do that for herself and then analyze the information, as opposed to just understanding it. %$* 249
and her-- %$* 249
she didn't have those skills. %$* 249
they hadn't taught them to her in her high school. %$* 249
as a result-- %$* 249
as a result, janelle's gpa dropped and she lost eligibility for her scholarships. %$* 249
now, the good news is, she did-- %$* 249
she has managed to return to college as a sophomore. %$* 249
she was able to fill the gap left by her scholarships with student loans. %$* 249
many children in her-- %$* 249
in her situation would have given up and dropped out. %$* 249
the common core is for janelle and for the thousands of students who are giving it their all but not getting their money's worth. %$* 249
now, i agree with something rick has said before, which is that standards are meaningless unless they're translated into effective instruction. %$* 249
as mike noted, the common core is not a silver bullet for all that ails our education system. %$* 249
but it is an essential building block. %$* 249
and for students like janelle who, for generations, have been shortchanged by the old, failed system, new standards will help ensure they are never left behind again. %$* 249
we know what we were doing before wasn't working. %$* 249
we see remediation rates as high as one in four college students who are not ready for college-level material. %$* 249
and that translates, just here in new york, to $80 million in wasted resources that could be spent on other supports for our students to be successful. %$* 249
and that doesn't even address the students like janelle who are not in remediation, but are struggling with college level content. %$* 249
some schools, like the one that carol runs, have adopted international baccalaureate programs or advanced placement courses to supplement the old state standards, but we can't rely on visionary principles like carol-- %$* 249
or a patchwork of programs to close our nation's gaping achievement gaps or prepare future generations to compete with china. %$* 249
now, i'd like to cut-- %$* 249
clear up a couple misconceptions about the common core that had been promoted by the glenn becks of the world. %$* 249
first the common core was not developed in secret and was not developed by the federal government. %$* 249
this was an initiative led by democratic governor markell of delaware and republican governor sonny perdue of georgia. %$* 249
back in 2008, virtually all of the governors, with the exception of rick perry and sarah palin, were strongly supportive of it. %$* 249
unlike the previous patchwork of standards, the common core was developed with significant input from educators and content experts, like the national council of teachers of mathematics. %$* 249
the authors consulted teacher unions, the civil rights community, college leaders, and business leaders. %$* 249
the standards were revised based on over 10,000 comments from the general public. %$* 249
and contrary to the assertion of the opposition, most teachers are not opposed to the standards, and indeed strongly support them. %$* 249
now, i appreciate that there has been a great deal of controversy about the way the standards have been implemented and concerns with how test scores are being used in our education system. %$* 249
i think those concerns are real. %$* 249
and we should-- %$* 249
we should address them. %$* 249
but-- %$* 249
and teachers, when asked about the standards in the context of accountability-- %$* 249
particularly accountability for themselves-- %$* 249
their own performance-- %$* 249
they're hesitant about the standards. %$* 249
but despite these concerns, a winston poll in early august revealed that two out of three teachers approved of the adoption and believed they are what their students need to be successful. %$* 249
and when implementation is done well, which i strongly believe requires that you use teachers to help you develop an implementation plan-- %$* 249
teachers feel excited about the standards and believe they have more, not less, freedom in their classroom. %$* 249
john, a high school geometry teacher, said it better than i could: “the old standards gave teachers a set of specific and sometimes constricting direction on where to turn, when to turn, and how fast to go. %$* 249
the common core standards instead give us mileposts to aim for, tell us where we should end up but not how to get there.” and this was something that mike and i heard loud and clear this afternoon when we were talking to teachers from right here in new york. %$* 249
later in the debate, i'm sure we'll talk more about the challenges of implementation and the need for commonsense use of tests. %$* 249
those are important issues. %$* 249
but because we have challenges doesn't mean that we should turn our backs on the incredible work that's been done over the last four years here in new york and around the country to lay the groundwork for the implementation of these standards. %$* 249
i think there are commonsense ways we can and should make implementation go more smoothly. %$* 249
as mike said, i think that the common-- %$* 249
new assessments aligned to the common core will address one of the chief complaints of teachers and students alike, fill in the bubble tests. %$* 249
because the common core requires children become problem solvers and good communicators, the new tests aligned to them will measure complex thinking, reading, writing, communications, and problem solving kids' skills. %$* 249
as a result, teachers will no longer be driven to narrow the curriculum or teach to a bad test. %$* 249
there have always been standards and always will be standards. %$* 249
there have always been tests and there always will be tests. %$* 249
it's time to get them right. %$* 249
for that reason, i ask you to "embrace the common core." %$* 249
thank you, carmel martin, speaking for the motion. %$* 13
and now, to speak against the motion in the final statement of the opening round, please welcome rick hess. %$* 13
he is a resident scholar and director of educational policy studies at the american enterprise institute, author of several books on education including, "cage busting leadership." speaking against the motion, "embrace the common core." please welcome rick hess. %$* 13
it's a pleasure to be here with you this evening to talk about this issue. %$* 252
notice that we-- %$* 252
i am not here to argue that the common core is malicious or atrocious. %$* 252
i am here to argue that we should not embrace it. %$* 252
now, you might wonder why. %$* 252
i heard mike try to recharacterize the common core as meaning that one is for standards, for high standards, and for great tests. %$* 252
well, if that's the common core, then i'm for it, too. %$* 252
but that's actually not the common core. %$* 252
that is mike trying to turn the common core into a vague principle that we like good stuff. %$* 252
carmel talked about janelle. %$* 252
i got to tell you, if you think there was any state in the union, circa 2009, that said, "it's state standards," or, "it's okay to graduate high school as an illiterate," that's actually not the facts on the ground. %$* 252
the standards bear only a passing resemblance to what is asked of kids and what actually gets taught. %$* 252
but that's all kind of a distraction. %$* 252
there's a couple reasons that we should absolutely not embrace the common core. %$* 252
first, the common core does not solve the problem that it was designed to solve. %$* 252
the motivation behind the launch of the common core was what we called the "race to the bottom," after no child left behind, the concern that states were playing games with their test scores in order to make their schools look better than they were. %$* 252
common core was supposed to help address this. %$* 252
it doesn't. %$* 252
it doesn't because in order to get a lot of states to sign on, partly with the inducement of federal money, the advocates for the common core brutally compromised the design of the thing. %$* 252
common core allows every state to set its own cut score, so every state can decide what is or is not passing. %$* 252
the smarter balanced consortium, one of the two federally funded testing consortia, gives states a 12-week testing window. %$* 252
they can decide where in a 12-week period during the spring they would like to test their kids. %$* 252
that means some states can have their kids get 50 percent more learning time than other states. %$* 252
this is a time-tested way to inflate your test scores. %$* 252
and only about 35 to 40 percent of students are actually going to be tested in the spring with the federally funded common core assessments. %$* 252
other states have been bailing in droves, and we've now got a slew of states whipping up half-baked assessments for next spring that certainly aren't comparable and very likely may be lousier tests than the one they abandoned for the common core. %$* 252
so the bottom line is that common core actually not only doesn't solve the race to the bottom problem, it may actually aggravate it. %$* 252
second issue going on here is a number of strident claims were made for the common core. %$* 252
we are told that the common core is evidence based. %$* 252
we are told that it's internationally benchmarked, that it's rigorous. %$* 252
well, that evidence is about as disciplined as mike's reference to the - - his assertion that every study over 30 years-- %$* 252
just no, you can't make statements like this. %$* 252
there are tens of thousands of studies conducted of united states education, and they don't all show anything. %$* 252
the idea that the common core is evidence based? %$* 252
look, what they mean is the folks sitting on the committees that wrote the common core looked at some statistics on the kinds of high school courses that college kids take, and they looked at some surveys of employers and college professors. %$* 252
that's fine. %$* 252
that's good. %$* 252
i'm glad they did that. %$* 252
that's not evidence of what needs to be or not be in the common core. %$* 252
in fact, i'm not sure what kind of evidence one would point to, to prove that children need to learn to multiply fractions at this grade rather than that grade. %$* 252
frankly, these are judgment calls which reasonable people can disagree on. %$* 252
lynn fuchs, professor at vanderbilt, who's got no dog in the common core fight, has pointed out that there's no empirical basis for the common core, that we don't know yet whether it makes sense to have this particular set of standards or not. %$* 252
internationally benchmarked? %$* 252
what they mean is that people on the committees writing the common core looked at some international standards, and they copied some, and they didn't copy others. %$* 252
the idea that the common core's more rigorous? %$* 252
well, frankly, the common core ends high school math after algebra 2.most state standards went beyond that. %$* 252
they included trigonometry and pre-calculus before the common core. %$* 252
now, mike and carmel might say that they don't think that stuff's necessary or useful, but it's hard for somebody to convince me that these are undeniably more rigorous standards when we're jettisoning the last two years of mathematics. %$* 252
now, this would all be interesting enough and a reason to maybe go slow, but there's another piece to the puzzle, which is that common core is actually not just about words on paper. %$* 252
it's also about theories of hypotheses about how kids will learn better. %$* 252
these hypotheses are baked into the common core, into the tests that have been designed to support the common core, and they have received shockingly little debate, given how radical they are. %$* 252
one is a fascination with what common core advocates called close reading. %$* 252
this is the idea that students ought to learn to read by deciphering the text-- %$* 252
preferably nonfiction, by deciphering the text without regard to other knowledge and without any personal reaction to the text. %$* 252
now, i don't have a problem with close reading. %$* 252
it turns out when i taught high school two decades ago, i actually did a fair bit of this. %$* 252
but the idea that this is how every child at every grade level in every subject across an ocean ought to experience reading? %$* 252
i find that a radical proposition. %$* 252
common core embraces something called conceptual math. %$* 252
you may have seen some of the worksheets or the youtube videos. %$* 252
this is the stuff that carol was talking about, the idea that elementary children in particular ought to master math by learning the concepts, not just the arithmetic, and the best way to master these concepts is by composing and decomposing lots of these numbers in various drawing exercises. %$* 252
i don't have a problem with this as a way to teach kids math. %$* 252
i find it shocking that this should be the way all children of all performance levels across the nation ought to learn it. %$* 252
third, the common core embraces something called informational text, informational reading. %$* 252
at the high school level it wants kids to read 70 percent informational text. %$* 252
it doesn't want to do this in english class, which is why we are now looking at children in chemistry classes, for instance, reading epa reports. %$* 252
the idea that you are going to learn science more effectively by reading epa reports than by doing lab is a radical proposition. %$* 252
in some, given that the common core doesn't solve the problem, it has been sold based on exaggerated claim and calls for major changes of a certain value, it seems to me reasonable not to embrace the darn thing. %$* 252
thank you. %$* 252
thank you, rick hess. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "embrace the common core." remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
i want to remind you again that after the debate you'll vote a second time and the team whose numbers have changed the most in your estimation in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another in turn and they take questions from me and from you and the audience. %$* 13
but to remember where we are and where we've been, we have two teams against two, carmel martin and mike petrilli are arguing that you embrace the common core, thereby they're arguing for the motion. %$* 13
their argument's saying, "no," they're saying, "the standards are not perfect." they're saying, "the implementation has had problems." but they say that basically the idea is sound and the need is real, that our schools are mediocre, that they're letting down students, not allowing them to graduate in ways where they're prepared for college or the or the job world. %$* 13
they say that the testing issue is solvable. %$* 13
they say it makes no sense to go backwards at this point because of the chaos that would result. %$* 13
and finally they says “the common core standards are a crucial step forward for american education”.the team arguing against the motion, carol burris and rick hess arguing that you do not embrace the common core. %$* 13
they agree that the standards are not perfect and then some. %$* 13
their argument is that the standards disregard decades of research on child development, on how children learn. %$* 13
that in the testing, children are being presented with questions of such obscurity that it makes them cry. %$* 13
they say that it’s, when the claim that their raising the standard is bogus, when they’re doing things like jettisoning the last two years of mathematics. %$* 13
and they finally come down with this, that there is no evidence that the standards actually will lead to improvements in student achievement. %$* 13
so, i want to look at a lot of this and slice it up. %$* 13
but there’s one point that i want to get to early in this. %$* 13
given that a lot of the controversy about this debate has been of a political nature, i heard the opposition make an argument based on substance, which i welcome. %$* 13
nevertheless, it’s a very political hot potato with the accusation being made that the common core was designed in secret by a small cabal of people directed by bill gates and by the obama administration. %$* 13
your opponent carmel martin, who to some degree was defending against this. %$* 13
you didn’t make that argument at all. %$* 13
i just want to know, do you concede her point? %$* 13
do you take the point that it was a state thing and on the charges that this is a top down obama administration program is one that you concede to that side? %$* 13
i would say yes and no. %$* 251
you know, certainly they weren’t conceived in secret, but they were conceived by a very, very small group of people who were predominantly non- educators. %$* 251
and the input happened after the fact. %$* 251
certainly as an educator, i had really no awareness of any of this going on and i stay very current. %$* 251
until 2010, and then everything was presented in one fell swoop. %$* 251
certainly the president has made it very clear that he is supportive of the common core standards but mostly what happened was race to the top. %$* 251
and that was a federal program. %$* 251
and if you look at some of the writings and went back to 2008, as the governors association were talking about this, they were actually saying these are the kinds of incentives that we need. %$* 251
carol, remind people what race to the top was. %$* 13
right, race to the top was a stimulus program that came into effect shortly after president obama was elected president. %$* 251
the whole idea behind race to the top was that there were going to have to be radical changes in schools, adoption of common core standards or something similar., testing programs, evaluation of teachers by test scores, and other things. %$* 251
and in order to get the money and we all desperately needed the money, states very, very quickly put together applications. %$* 251
okay, let me take that to your opponent. %$* 13
i guess we will touch somewhat on the politics of this. %$* 13
i’m going to take this back to carmel martin between you responded to this in your opening statement. %$* 13
we’re hearing carol burris saying that de facto, the fact that the administration offered prizes, financial prizes to schools, partly for adopting common standards, does suggest that that this was a federally steered, to some degree federally steered effort. %$* 13
well, i would say again, this was an effort that was underway before president obama was president obama. %$* 249
it was led by a democratic and republican governor from very diverse states. %$* 249
they had the support of virtually again, sarah palin and rick perry don’t support much, but the other 48 governors were strongly supportive of it. %$* 249
and the obama administration supported an initiative that was state led, that was driven from, i would argue, bottom up, not top down. %$* 249
and i think what we need to keep in mind though, is even if-- %$* 249
we’ll never know how many states would have adopted the standards but for the incentives provided by the federal government. %$* 249
but then the question before us right now is, given that it was something that was developed, through i would argue, contrary to carol, through a very rigorous process. %$* 249
it brought teachers into the process. %$* 249
it brought the public into the process. %$* 249
and then once each state adopted it, there was process at the state level around the standards. %$* 249
so, then the question before us is, are the standards good for our students? %$* 249
and mike and i think it is. %$* 249
okay, and we will come to that question. %$* 13
i want to see if we want to do one more round on the political issue. %$* 13
rick hess, if you want to respond to what carmel said. %$* 13
yes, i think first off, carmel is playing, her characterization of the timeline is i think loose-- %$* 252
what the governors supported in 2008 was the exploration of the idea of making some standards more common. %$* 252
i think most folks, in 2009, 2010, imagine there were maybe a dozen or 15 states that were, themselves, ready, unprovoked, to move forward and explore the common core. %$* 252
in fact, mike, i'd like to hear your take, because you, for instance, have said that the federal government has been heavy-handed with common core and deserves to be chastened. %$* 252
in fact, you have encouraged oklahoma governor mary fallin to sue-- %$* 252
rick hess-- %$* 13
the secretary of education. %$* 252
i just want to remind you to pull your papers under the mic, because-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 252
we lose you a little bit when you turn away-- %$* 13
my apologies. %$* 252
why don't you-- %$* 13
why don't you rephrase the question again, just so the radio audience gets to hear it? %$* 13
sure. %$* 252
no. %$* 252
absolutely. %$* 252
my apologies for that. %$* 252
mike, i'm curious on your response to carmel, given that you have previously testified to the indiana state senate that the federal government has been heavy-handed with this reform and deserves to be chastened. %$* 252
and that you have, in fact, said that you hope the oklahoma governor, mary fallin, sues the u.s. secretary of education because not through race to the top, but through waivers from no child left behind-- %$* 252
you said, "nothing gives a secretary of education the authority to push states around when it comes to those standards." %$* 252
okay. %$* 13
mike, you got to hear the question twice. %$* 13
extra time to think about it. %$* 13
i did. %$* 250
yes. %$* 250
and it had a question mark at the end. %$* 250
that was good. %$* 250
yes. %$* 250
absolutely. %$* 250
and if we were here to debate the federal role in education, i would move over there. %$* 250
maybe carol would be over here. %$* 250
i'm not sure. %$* 250
but we are here to debate-- %$* 250
to debate the common core, right? %$* 250
it is true. %$* 250
look, the-- %$* 250
i think everybody is in agreement. %$* 250
i wrote an article recently with a strong opponent of the common core. %$* 250
we wrote together. %$* 250
here are the facts. %$* 250
it started out as a state-led initiative. %$* 250
and then the obama administration came in and endorsed it. %$* 250
there's no doubt that it had a big impact in the number of states that got involved. %$* 250
and in my opinion, we would all be much better off if the federal government would now butt out. %$* 250
so, carmel, maybe you can share that view with the secretary of education. %$* 250
all right. %$* 13
let's move on. %$* 13
let's stipulate that this side feels that this was not top-down, that it was-- %$* 13
it started with the states. %$* 13
this side feels it's murkier than that. %$* 13

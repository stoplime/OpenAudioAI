so, spontaneous applause moment number one, please, let's welcome robert rosenkranz to the stage. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 13
so, bob, one thing we wanted to clarify, the motion language is very tight. %$* 13
three words, shorter than we normally have. %$* 13
it sounds very obvious, but we-- %$* 13
we mean something specific when we say, "legalize assisted suicide," whose meaning could be more ambiguous than it sounds. %$* 13
well, i think what we mean is legalize physician-assisted suicide. %$* 1
okay. %$* 13
we want to be clear about that, because it's not broadly used-- %$* 13
so that’s what we’re talking about. %$* 1
and the other thing we were chatting backstage beforehand, a sort of interesting perspective that you have on this topic. %$* 13
you know, you've done a lot of things in your-- %$* 13
you've got-- %$* 13
had a number of careers behind you, and you were talking about that, number one, you've been an insurance executive, and number two, you've been a lawyer. %$* 13
and you, looking at this topic, those two perspectives gave you kind of interesting insight on this. %$* 13
so start with the insurance executive side of it first. %$* 13
well, our insurance company ensures about 8 percent of the u.s.labor force against catastrophic injuries at work. %$* 1
so, i see a lot of case of people who are really, really seriously injured. %$* 1
i saw one just last week, of somebody who is now a quadriplegic and going to be bedridden for the rest of their lives, to 30-year-old who has a life expectancy of 30 years. %$* 1
and a person like that, who might decide that life is not worth living cannot end it except with assistance. %$* 1
and yet the statute doesn't really cover them. %$* 1
the statutes at least in oregon and-- %$* 1
and washington only refer to terminally ill. %$* 1
so, in some ways, you know, the-- %$* 1
the statutory issue is narrower than what i think might be the issues that-- %$* 1
that ought to be discussed tonight. %$* 1
and that gets to the lawyer side of your experience. %$* 13
you went and sat down and read the statute, and you came back with some interesting responses. %$* 13
well, the other-- %$* 1
the other thing-- %$* 1
requirement of the statute besides terminal illness is that person has to be capable of making a decision. %$* 1
and that term "capable" is not defined. %$* 1
and indeed they talk about-- %$* 1
the statute talks about an ability to communicate their decision in ways that imply that the person is barely able to communicate at all. %$* 1
so, you know, maybe just shaking their head or squeezing a hand or blinking an eye or something like that, which the implication is that it would be very, very hard to actually assess their mental acute or their ability to make these critical decisions. %$* 1
so, that just struck me, as a lawyer, as a pretty troublesome bit of legal draftsmanship in this question of who is capable legally of deciding whether to invoke the statute for legally assisted suicide. %$* 1
so, what's interesting in this one is there is this clash of principles that runs right into practicalities and the practicalities, the details leave all sorts of room for interpretation. %$* 13
i mean, the more you think about this, the more complicated it gets. %$* 1
and it is a very, very highly emotional issue for a lot of people, and it's going to touch their lives in very profound ways. %$* 1
but we're talking about legalizing something, which means passing a statute, and therefore you've got to pay some attention to the language of that statute and what the limitations are and what the ambiguities are. %$* 1
well, we do have four debaters who are very, very well versed in this, and they are passionate about it, so let's welcome them to the stage. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for bringing this to us. %$* 13
sometime numbers can tell a simple story. %$* 13
so, here are some numbers from oregon which has had a death with dignity act since 1997, allowing individuals with terminal illnesses to get lethal prescriptions from their doctors to take their own lives. %$* 13
in the first 17 years of that program, the number of people who actually took their lives when they had the pills: 752.94 percent were caucasian. %$* 13
more than half had finished college. %$* 13
median age: 71.roughly divided between men and women. %$* 13
some more interesting numbers: 400 people in oregon got the pills but never took them. %$* 13
and a much larger number asked for the pills but were denied, five out of six were denied according to one early study. %$* 13
so the problem with all of these numbers i've just recited is that they actually don't tell a simple story and they don't answer the essential question of the rightness and wrongness, the morality, and the practicality of what is called "physician-assisted suicide" or sometimes "assisted dying," because it's not that obvious. %$* 13
and getting at it is really something that will take a good solid debate, so let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "legalize assisted suicide," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this motion, "legalize assisted suicide." as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, "legalize assisted suicide," and let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome peter singer. %$* 13
and, peter, you are a professor of bioethics at princeton. %$* 13
you have written some classic books, "animal liberation," "practical ethics." you are often described as-- %$* 13
and wait for this-- %$* 13
"the world's most influential living philosopher."you subscribe to a theory of ethics called, "utilitarianism." if you could explain that in one sentence, what would it be? %$* 13
sure, in one sentence, utilitarianism is the view that the right thing to do is the act that will have the best consequences, all things considered, of the options open to you. %$* 467
you nailed it in one sentence. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 467
thank you, peter singer. %$* 13
did i add-- %$* 13
did i-- %$* 13
did i add an extra syllable-- %$* 13
i said, "utilitarianism." %$* 13
that's correct. %$* 467
that's right? %$* 13
extra syllable. %$* 13
and please tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
my partner is andrew solomon. %$* 467
andrew's a writer who's written very movingly about this issue. %$* 467
he's also a public speaker. %$* 467
and if you look at the talks he's given on ted, ted.com, you will find that eight million people have viewed them, whereas my talk has only been viewed by one million. %$* 467
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew solomon. %$* 13
please welcome andrew solomon. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
andrew, a lot of your story was just told. %$* 13
you are a professor of clinical psychology at columbia. %$* 13
you are an award winning author of several books, including "far from the tree: parents, children, and the search for identity," and "the noonday demon." you have also written about your family's own experience with assisted suicide, and, in an article from 1995, you note that back in the '90s no one wanted to hear about it or ask about it, that the subject was completely taboo. %$* 13
now it's legal in five states and 20 years have gone by, have times changed? %$* 13
is the subject still taboo? %$* 13
well, it's somewhat less taboo, but in a society in which people tend to be in denial about the reality of mortality altogether, getting them to talk about this is still frequently a struggle. %$* 500
but i think speaking about it openly, as we are doing tonight, is one way to help people be less afraid to tell their families or to tell their doctors what they actually think and feel. %$* 500
we will be discussing it tonight, thank you, andrew solomon. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize assisted suicide." and we have two debaters who will be arguing vociferously against this motion. %$* 13
please let's welcome baroness ilora finlay. %$* 13
baroness finlay is a member of the house of lords, and after this she is just "ilora." she has agreed that while she's here in the former colonies she will drop the honorific. %$* 13
she is, more importantly, a palliative care physician. %$* 13
she is president of the british medical association, and she comes to this debate with a personal story that she will share later on as well. %$* 13
but she's also, as i said, a member of britain's house of lords where an assisted suicide bill is being considered. %$* 13
and, ilora, doctors everywhere are for the most part opposed to these laws, but the majority of the public most everywhere support it, how come? %$* 13
well, i think it's important to remember that doctors know the complexities of trying to do assessments as to whether somebody really wants this or not and all the other issues that would have already been touched on. %$* 501
they also know about advances in medicine and that things today are very different. %$* 501
most of the public sees stuff on the media that looks scary. %$* 501
they're scared about their own dying and we're all going to die. %$* 501
and they also often have memories of things that might have happened a quarter of a century ago. %$* 501
i'm going to stop you right there because i think you're getting into your debate material. %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 501
i'm just so enthusiastic. %$* 501
thank you. %$* 13
ilora finlay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 501
and tell us, please, who your partner is? %$* 13
i'd like to introduce the kind, caring dr. %$* 501
daniel sulmasy, who has studied this in-depth-- %$* 501
ladies and gentlemen-- %$* 13
and is a physician. %$* 501
ladies and gentlemen, dr. %$* 13
daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
and daniel, you're-- %$* 13
you wear several hats. %$* 13
you're also arguing against the motion, "legalize assisted suicide," but you wear several hats. %$* 13
you're a professor of medicine and ethics, and-- %$* 13
at the department of medicine and divinity school at the university of chicago. %$* 13
you also have been a member of the presidential committee on the study of bioethical problems since 2010. you have an md and a phd. what we're wondering is, you know, with these hats you wear-- %$* 13
medicine, ethics, religion-- %$* 13
do they clash or do they work well together? %$* 13
i think, in some ways, what it really means is i have too many bosses. %$* 502
but beyond that, they fit together seamlessly for me, really. %$* 502
i mean, doctor, when you think about it, means "teacher." and i try to just be a good teacher for my ethics students, for my medical students, and for my patients. %$* 502
well, we'll be getting some teaching you-- %$* 13
from you tonight, i imagine. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
and those are our four debaters. %$* 13
and to remind you, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest of persuasion with ideas, logic. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here in new york, will be serving as our judges in picking the winners of this contest. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have voted twice-- %$* 13
once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's have the preliminary-- %$* 13
the first vote now. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat-- %$* 13
you see a set of numbers on them? %$* 13
just pay attention to 1, 2, and 3.if you agree with this motion at this point, legalize assisted suicide, push number 1.if you disagree, push number 2.and if you're undecided, push number 3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they are not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong one by mistake, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and we'll lock it out in about 10 seconds. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it looks like we're good. %$* 13
we're going to move forward. %$* 13
we go in three rounds. %$* 13
let's begin with round 1.round 1.our motion is legalize assisted suicide. %$* 13
here we have opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they'll be-- %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and here to make his first opening statement, supporting the motion, legalize assisted suicide, andrew solomon. %$* 13
he is a professor of clinical psychology at columbia university, author of the book "far from the tree: parents, children, and the search for identity." ladies and gentlemen, andrew solomon. %$* 13
because much of modern medicine prolongs not living but dying, we need to rethink death itself. %$* 500
making someone die in a way that others approve, but that he feels is anathema, is an odious form of tyranny. %$* 500
aid-in-dying needs to be tightly regulated, as any life or death matter does, from driving to surgery. %$* 500
but while no one should be pressed into assisted dying, no one should be categorically denied that right. %$* 500
it's about dignity. %$* 500
in his dissent in cruzan, supreme court justice william brennan said, "an ignoble end steeped in decay is abhorrent. %$* 500
a quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme confidence.” and it's about reassurance. %$* 500
brittany maynard, who captured headlines for choosing to end her life at the age of 29 at the end of a battle with brain cancer, said, "it has given me peace. %$* 500
i do not want to die, but i am dying, and i want to die on my own terms." it's not about depression. %$* 500
when hope of recovery is gone, when one achieves relief from physical symptoms only at the cost of mental clarity, when – one’s dignity is lost to physical deterioration, the wish to end your life may be rational. %$* 500
now, there are some people who find great meaning in those very final stages. %$* 500
but there are other people who are not interested in finding that meaning. %$* 500
and from a non-theological point of view, it can be argued that the meaning people attach to that stage of life is an artifact of the human imagination. %$* 500
it's not about suicide. %$* 500
suicide responds to personal disintegration while this precludes it. %$* 500
and it is about the limitations of medicine. %$* 500
it's nothing short of medical arrogance to say that palliative care and hospice can adequately deal with the end of every life. %$* 500
hospice, in fact, can impose an authoritarian, hard, paternalistic view that the hospice way of dying is the only way, and it's rooted in precedent, as john said in the opening, in oregon, where after 17 years, only 752 people have died from lethal prescriptions, which is to say .2 percent of the people in the state who have died. %$* 500
as hillary once hoped for abortion, this is safe, legal and rare, and it has popular support. %$* 500
according to a 2013 gallup poll, 70 percent of americans support legalization of physician assistance in dying. %$* 500
when my mother's friend, sandy, was dying of cancer, my mother visited and saw her in the hospital where she was screaming in pain and so heavily medicated that she was unable to recognize the other people in the room. %$* 500
and when she came home, my mother said, "if i ever get to that state of pain, promise that one of you will shoot me." my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 56. and when her first chemotherapy failed, she said that she would submit to another round of agonizing treatment only on the condition that someone got her those pills. %$* 500
by the time of her third chemo, she was in dilapidated health. %$* 500
she was vomiting. %$* 500
she had a persistent malaise, she had hair loss, she was negotiating surgical adhesions, but she also had the pills. %$* 500
and the agony became unimportant because the symptoms were permanent only until she decided that she could take no more, and then she would be free, and so the disease was no longer in control of her. %$* 500
my grieving father, my mother, my brother and i talked through the logistics as though a dress rehearsal would exhaust some of the pain of the loss in advance. %$* 500
we planned it together, much as we had once planned parties or family vacations or christmas. %$* 500
we were liberated by our newly clarified emotions, but we were entombed in the loneliness of our illegal collusion. %$* 500
my mother went to see a gastroenterologist two years after she got sick, who told her that she had significant tumors in her intestines and would soon be unable to digest food. %$* 500
she called my brother and me, and she said that it was time. %$* 500
it was all very much as we had planned it. %$* 500
she said, "the only thing i still fear is this not going smoothly." and she took the antiemetics. %$* 500
a few nights earlier, my mother and my brother had pulled a wishbone, and my mother had won. %$* 500
and now my brother said to her, "what did you wish for? %$* 500
" and she said, "i wished for this to be over as quickly as possible. %$* 500
and i got my wish, i got my wishes so often." and then she said, "when you were children, i wanted my love to make the world a safe place for you. %$* 500
and my greatest hope is that it will still wrap you up for your whole life." and she said to my father, "i would gladly have given decades of my life to be the one to go first. %$* 500
for 30 years, howard, you have been my life." and then as her voice slowed with the medication, she said, "i'm sad to be going." but even with this early death, i wouldn't want to change my life for any other life in the world. %$* 500
i have loved completely, and i have been completely loved, and i've had such a good time. %$* 500
i've looked for so many things in this life, so many things. %$* 500
and all the time, paradise was in this room with the three of you." i've seen other deaths, and i remember feeling that they belonged to the hospital or the illness or the gun or the catastrophe. %$* 500
this death was my mother's own. %$* 500
she was the same person in death that she had been in life, and it was her right to choose it over a death like sandy's, and it should be everyone's right. %$* 500
the words "liberty" and "dignity" are nearly synonymous in death as they are in love. %$* 500
thank you, andrew solomon. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize assisted suicide." and here to argue against the motion, daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
he is kilbride-clinton professor of medicine and ethics in the department of medicine and divinity school at the university of chicago. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
as you heard, i am a physician. %$* 502
and part of my job is to help people die with dignity and in comfort. %$* 502
but i don't want to help you or your daughter or your uncle to commit suicide. %$* 502
and you shouldn't want me to. %$* 502
i urge you to oppose physician-assisted suicide, because it's bad ethical reasoning, bad medicine and bad policy. %$* 502
i'm going to concentrate on the first of these, and ilora will take up the other two. %$* 502
now we strongly support the right of patients to refuse treatments and believe physicians have a duty to treat pain and other symptoms even to the point of hastening death. %$* 502
but empowering physicians to assist patients with suicide is quite another matter. %$* 502
striking at the heart not just of medical ethics, but of ethics itself. %$* 502
that's because the very idea of interpersonal ethics depends upon our mutual recognition of each other's equal independent worth, the value that we have simply because we are fellow human beings. %$* 502
some would have you believe that mortality-- %$* 502
that morality depends upon equal interests, usually defined by preferences, and of advanced utilitarian arguments based on that assumption. %$* 502
but which is more important: people or their preferences? %$* 502
as aristotle observed, small errors at the beginning of an argument lead to large errors at the end. %$* 502
if interests take preference over the people who have them, then assisting the suicide of a patient who has lost interest in living is certainly something that would be morally praise worthy. %$* 502
but it would also follow that active euthanasia ought to be permitted, that the severely demented could be euthanized without their explicit consent, even experimented upon. %$* 502
and it also follows that infanticide ought to be permitted for children with congenital illnesses. %$* 502
now, many might see these as frightful conclusions, but this is not just the slippery slope. %$* 502
these all follow logically from arguing for assisted suicide on the basis of maximizing our individual interests. %$* 502
so, if you don't believe in euthanizing severely disabled children or the demented, you might want to rethink your support for assisted suicide, at least if you want to be consistent. %$* 502
now, is assisted suicide death with dignity? %$* 502
the word "dignity" has at least two senses. %$* 502
proponents, like the one you heard, use the word in an attributed sense to denote the value others confer on them or the value they might even confer upon themselves. %$* 502
but there's a deeper, intrinsic sense of dignity. %$* 502
human dignity ultimately rests not on a person's interests, but on the value of the person whose interests they are. %$* 502
i don't have to ask you what your preferences are to know that you have dignity. %$* 502
and martin luther king says that he learned this from his grandmother who told him, "martin, don't let anybody ever tell you that you're not a somebody." somebodiness, this intrinsic sense of dignity, was at the heart of our civil rights movement. %$* 502
and the message is that it doesn't matter what a person looks like, how productive that person might be, how others view that person or even how that person may have come to have viewed herself. %$* 502
what matters is that everybody, black or white, sick or well, is a somebody. %$* 502
now, assisted suicide and euthanasia require us to accept that it is morally permissible to act with the specific intention of making a somebody into a nobody, to make them dead. %$* 502
intentions, not just outcomes, matter in ethics. %$* 502
intending that somebody be turned into a nobody violates the fundamental basis of our interpersonal ethics, our intrinsic dignity. %$* 502
we live in a society that worships independence, youth, and beauty. %$* 502
yet we know that illness and aging often bring dependence and disfigurement. %$* 502
the terminally ill, especially, need to be reminded of their intrinsic dignity at a time of fierce doubt. %$* 502
they need to know that their ultimate value doesn't depend upon how they look, how productive they are, or their independence. %$* 502
you see, assisted suicide flips the default switch. %$* 502
the question the terminally ill hear, even if never spoken, is "you've become a burden for you and for us. %$* 502
why haven't you gotten rid of yourself yet? %$* 502
" now, a good utilitarian might think that a proper question, even a moral duty, but as a physician who cares for dying patients, i am much more fearful of the burden this question imposes on the many who might otherwise choose to live, than the modest restriction imposed on a few when assisted suicide is illegal. %$* 502
assisted suicide should not be necessary. %$* 502
if it's pain and other symptoms you fear, they can almost always be alleviated. %$* 502
as evidence, consider that pain or other symptoms rarely come up as the reasons for assisted suicide. %$* 502
the top reasons are: fear of being considered a burden and wanting to be in control. %$* 502
now, you may ask, "why shouldn't i have this option? %$* 502
" and yet we all realize that society puts many restrictions on liberty and for a variety of reasons, to protect others, to promote the common good, to safeguard the bases of morality and law. %$* 502
for example, we don't permit persons to drive drunk or to freely sell themselves into slavery. %$* 502
paradoxically, in physician assisted suicide and euthanasia, patients turn control over to physicians who assess their eligibility and must provide the means. %$* 502
and, further, since death obliterates all liberty, saying that respect for liberty justifies the obliteration of liberty actually undermines the value that we place on human freedom. %$* 502
now, ilora and i live our lives dedicated to supporting patients and families, to listening to patients at the end of life, to relieving suffering, and to valuing them to the end. %$* 502
that's why you shouldn't vote for assisted suicide. %$* 502
daniel sulmasy, i'm sorry your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
that's why you shouldn't vote for assisted suicide. %$* 502
thank you. %$* 13
daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "legalize assisted suicide." you have heard the first two opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the lectern peter singer. %$* 13
he is-- %$* 13
let me just say this, peter singer is the ira w.decamp professor of bioethics in the university center for human values at princeton and laureate professor at the university of melbourne. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, peter singer. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 467
let's be clear what we are debating this evening. %$* 467
it's "legalize assisted suicide." it's not "put utilitarianism into practice," and it's also not anything further to do with other areas in which one may or may not think that sometimes death is preferable and ought to be provided. %$* 467
that is not the topic. %$* 467
you're asked to discuss-- %$* 467
to focus only on this quite narrow question. %$* 467
now, if you think about that question, we are, of course, influenced by the idea that normally death is a bad thing. %$* 467
we often think of it as the very worst thing that can happen to us. %$* 467
but if we ask ourselves why that should be, "why is death a bad thing? %$* 467
" then we can think that there are a variety of reasons in normal circumstances. %$* 467
for instance, people want to go on living, so death is contrary to that very strong wish that people have. %$* 467
it violates their autonomy. %$* 467
if somebody else in particular kills them, it normally violates their autonomy, which is something that we ought to respect. %$* 467
secondly, death ends your life, and most of us think of life as a positive, as a good thing, fortunately. %$* 467
so, it prevents you from continuing to live that life that you find worthwhile, that you find fulfilling and rich, that brings you happiness and other values. %$* 467
and, thirdly, death is a bad thing for those who love and care for the person who dies. %$* 467
it's a source of grief to them that someone they love dies. %$* 467
so that's why normally, of course, we should not promote death, let alone kill people. %$* 467
but there are very special circumstances in which none of these things apply, and that's what we're talking about tonight. %$* 467
there are circumstances in which the person who is considering death wants to die. %$* 467
that is their autonomous choice. %$* 467
so, death is not a violation of their autonomy, or contrary to their strongest wishes. %$* 467
but it's in accordance with them, as andrew described in the case of his mother just now. %$* 467
secondly, there are cases in which a person has no more valuable life to look forward to, valuable by their judgment, not valuable by somebody else's judgment imposing on them the idea that their life is still worthwhile, even though they, having thought the matter through-- %$* 467
perhaps having thought it through for many years-- %$* 467
again, as in the case andrew described, have decided that life would not be worth living for them under some circumstances. %$* 467
and in particular, if they have only a short time to live, as in the case of the statutes in oregon and washington, and now vermont as well, then they know that they cannot look forward to more years of happiness. %$* 467
and as for the grief that those who love them will feel, of course they will feel that grief if they die now. %$* 467
but in the cases covered by these statutes, where people are terminally ill and likely to die-- %$* 467
two doctors certify that they will die, they have less than six months to live, then the family is going to grieve anyway. %$* 467
and the caring family-- %$* 467
like andrew and his brother-- %$* 467
will at least feel that the person they love got to die at a time of their own choosing. %$* 467
and that's important. %$* 467
now, in fact, this idea that this is sometimes a good thing is recognized by our opponents. %$* 467
daniel sulmasy just said that sometimes it's justifiable to relieve patients' pain, if you're hastening death. %$* 467
it's not the hastening death that they object to, because they acknowledge that you can withdraw treatment that would keep patients alive-- %$* 467
sometimes would keep patients alive for a long time. %$* 467
it's the intention of ending a patient's life that they object to. %$* 467
but we don't have to accept that morality. %$* 467
that's a specific morality which daniel sulmasy is free to hold, of course. %$* 467
and if he-- %$* 467
as he said at the beginning-- %$* 467
would not like you-- %$* 467
to help you end your life, that's entirely up to him. %$* 467
nobody is suggesting he should be compelled to end anyone's life against his conscience. %$* 467
but if a different doctor-- %$* 467
and there are such doctors-- %$* 467
is willing to do that, indeed, thinks that that's the best final care that he can give to a patient who he can no longer restore to a situation that the patient considers worthwhile, then i don't-- %$* 467
i don't think we should be hung up by this idea that something is somehow always a wrongful intention, even if in normal circumstances, to aim at someone's death would be a wrongful intention. %$* 467
but not in these circumstances. %$* 467
in these circumstances, it may be the right intention. %$* 467
now, i'm sure we're going to hear from probably ilora finlay, i guess, that there are risks – that this is a dangerous thing-- %$* 467
that it will lead to a slippery slope. %$* 467
that argument has been around in this debate for a long time. %$* 467
i think that when i first became interested in this question-- %$* 467
which now goes back about 40 years. %$* 467
that that was an argument that you had to treat very seriously and had to give a lot of weight to. %$* 467
and i could not be completely sure that it was not justified. %$* 467
but now we have much more experience of the legalization of assisted suicide. %$* 467
we have, in the netherlands-- %$* 467
in fact, more than 30 years' experience of the open practice of-- %$* 467
by the medical profession, with the support of the royal dutch medical society-- %$* 467
not against the doctors' views-- %$* 467
of that practice. %$* 467
and with its full legalization, about 14-- %$* 467
about 12 years ago. %$* 467
and fully supported by the dutch population, so that although there's been a succession of governments-- %$* 467
some conservative, some more liberal, one of them under a roman catholic prime minister-- %$* 467
they have not ever sought to repeal the legislation. %$* 467
and similarly, in oregon, we now have 17 years of experience, a relatively small number of people dying each year. %$* 467
and as you heard, more of them requesting the prescriptions, but not using them, because they want the control. %$* 467
they want to know that they could end their life if they want to. %$* 467
so, with that experience, the experience of belgium as well, which followed the netherlands, its neighbor, and then luxembourg, and then also washington-- %$* 467
the state of washington, the neighbor of oregon, which was watching what was going on there, and decided that was a good system that they wanted, and therefore accepted it-- %$* 467
we have not seen a slippery slope here. %$* 467
we have, in fact, found that these-- %$* 467
this legalization is something endorsed by the populations concerned and supported by it, and they want it to continue. %$* 467
thank you. %$* 467
thank you. %$* 13
peter singer. %$* 13
our motion is legalize assisted suicide. %$* 13
and here is our final debater making an opening statement against the motion. %$* 13
ilora finlay, she is a leading palliative care physician. %$* 13
you can make your way to the lecturn. %$* 13
she is president of the british medical association. %$* 13
she is a member of the house of lords. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ilora finlay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 501
i'm a palliative care physician. %$* 501
for over a quarter of a century, i've looked after dying patients, thousands. %$* 501
i've had countless conversations about death and dying, and supported each in what they tell me they need, not some kind of formulaic death. %$* 501
but i've seen despair return to enjoy life in new found, unexpected and treasured ways. %$* 501
it is through compassion that i see how dangerous it is to license doctors to provide lethal drugs. %$* 501
how much assistance is needed? %$* 501
well, euthanasia, as practiced in the netherlands by and large, more than physician-assisted suicide, is the injection of lethal drugs. %$* 501
here in the u.s., that seems to be reserved for a state execution. %$* 501
it's pretty much the same drugs used. %$* 501
but let me tell you about someone. %$* 501
let me tell you about david, aged 36.his spinal tumor was causing very difficult pain and incipient paraplegia. %$* 501
his surgeon, oncologist, and family doctor all thought his prognosis was three months. %$* 501
and i was asked to see him only because his doctors couldn't give him a lethal injection. %$* 501
he seemed a very clear-cut case for assisted suicide. %$* 501
when i saw him, the distress was palpable. %$* 501
their third child was six weeks old. %$* 501
david fitted every criteria of every bit of legislation i have ever seen. %$* 501
he had a clear, settled wish, had mental capacity, was not being coerced and was very, very distressed. %$* 501
it was october. %$* 501
i thought he'd be dead by christmas. %$* 501
so what happened? %$* 501
after some persuasion, careful, gentle persuasion, he accepted my input. %$* 501
and gradually, he lost the wish to die. %$* 501
11 years later, he phoned me. %$* 501
his lovely wife had pancreatic cancer and was dying. %$* 501
that baby, now 11, sat with his sister, brother, and dad holding his dying mum's hand. %$* 501
is david an exception? %$* 501
no. %$* 501
he illustrates all the problems with proposals for assisted suicide. %$* 501
let's look briefly at what happens in states which have changed the law. %$* 501
over 16 years of oregon's law, assisted suicides have risen four and a half to fivefold. %$* 501
in washington state, which legalized assisted suicide in 2008, the rate of rise is fast deeper; 43 percent in one year alone. %$* 501
when you normalize physician-assisted suicide, the underlying social dynamic changes. %$* 501
laws aren't just regulatory instruments. %$* 501
they send a message. %$* 501
and the message they send is that if you're terminally ill, ending your life is something that you probably ought to think about. %$* 501
indeed, in holland, when they changed their law, they thought their figures had plateaued, but they've actually doubled. %$* 501
and in belgium, the belgians are quite frank about the fact that they know that somewhere around about half are actually happening outside the law. %$* 501
changing the law isn't simple and straightforward. %$* 501
so, what are some of the problems? %$* 501
well, let's look at prognosis. %$* 501
prognoses are notoriously inaccurate. %$* 501
even the most expert have a 50/50 chance of being wrong over life expectancy of six months. %$* 501
oregon's law requires a prognosis of six months or less, yet two years, nine months from request to death has been recorded. %$* 501
pathologists tell us that at postmortem, about 1 in 20 are found to have died from something different to the condition they were being treated for. %$* 501
and how real is a settled wish? %$* 501
40 percent of seriously ill people have some mental disturbance often attributed to the illness or anxiety or treatment. %$* 501
and in 13 to 14 percent, this is a major, treatable depression. %$* 501
yet oregon's own research shows a quarter of those seeking assisted suicide have depression, which is sometimes missed or overlooked. %$* 501
and research into a sample showed one in six of those given lethally-- %$* 501
lethal drugs legally supplied actually had an undiagnosed, untreated depression. %$* 501
the researchers themselves said the current practice of death with dignity act may not adequately protect all mentally ill patients. %$* 501
capacity, it has to be situation-specific, decision-specific. %$* 501
how do you assess capacity commensurate with the biggest decision that you could take; that to end your life? %$* 501
only 6 percent of oregon's psychiatrists feel confident to do it. %$* 501
pressures are harder to pick up than depression. %$* 501
coercion can be subtle, the costs of care, life insurance about to expire or just caregiver fatigue, the person who picks up that their family are stressed and doesn't want to be thought of badly. %$* 501
after all, most parents love their children, but not all children love their parents. %$* 501
and dignity, research has shown that the way that care is delivered enhances or undermines dignity. %$* 501
cicely saunders of the hospice movement said, "dignity is having a sense of personal worth." yet in oregon, 40 percent, and in washington, 61 percent cite concerns of being a burden, and 80 percent are concerned at losing their dignity. %$* 501
are they being made to feel their lives are an inconvenience to be disposed for the sake of others? %$* 501
and what of doctors? %$* 501
like it or not, you rely on your doctor. %$* 501
for the doctor under pressure, it is all too easy to give into the pressure to prescribe. %$* 501
doctors must recognize dying, not impose futile treatments and relieve distress. %$* 501
but i do not think they should be licensed to cut off life by weeks, months or years. %$* 501
remember david? %$* 501
i saw him last weekend, 23 years on from that first referral. %$* 501
and he said i can tell his story. %$* 501
he brought up the children alone, fantastically well. %$* 501
but what would have happened if his doctor had been able to accede to his request? %$* 501
it is too dangerous to license doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for suicide. %$* 501
please vote against this utilitarian motion. %$* 501
and it is utilitarian. %$* 501
thank you, ilora finlay. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "legalize assisted suicide."now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters can address one another directly, and they will take questions from you and from me. %$* 13
our motion is this: "legalize assisted suicide." and in our opening statements, we heard one team arguing for the motion, andrew solomon and peter singer, making the case that we need to rethink death in this country, that the principal here really is one of choice and that if the instruments are available to people who are in the last phases of their life to choose the time and the manner of their dying, then that should be their right. %$* 13
they say that in practice, in oregon and other states, this practice has been demonstrated to be safe, legal and rare, and for the medical physician to oppose this is an act of arrogance. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, ilora finlay and david sulmasy, they're both physicians, by the way, and both want to part of assisted suicide. %$* 13
they make the argument that to assist in taking somebody's life is to make a somebody into a nobody and that that is plainly and morally wrong; that assisted suicide, aid in dying, is bad ethical reasoning, bad medicine and bad policy. %$* 13
they also say that there are alternatives to assisted suicide for people who are suffering in life, such as palliative care and that our knowledge of death is so full of holes that it should not be something that doctors are handing out in the form of a pill. %$* 13
i want to go to the side that's arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and i want to go to andrew solomon who told a very powerful story about your mother and about your argument for personal choice. %$* 13
and i want to ask you-- %$* 13
i want to say to you that i believe your opponents are acknowledging the power and force of personal choice. %$* 13
they're just saying that there are other interests that are-- %$* 13
are larger and greater than that, that the personal choice that your mother made and that today more legally other people are making has social implications that ripple through society and affect all of us. %$* 13
basically, they're saying that there is no such thing as just a personal choice that affects one person, that it's broader than that. %$* 13
i wonder do you concede that point? %$* 13
well, i think that actually we send a very dark message to the society at large when we say to people that they don't have the right to make these decisions, when we say to people that we look at their suffering and their anguish, and we refuse to help or support them. %$* 500
i think that sends a social message. %$* 500
i think people have a difficult time speaking openly and directly to doctors if they know that what they are discussing is illegal, and they don't know what their doctor's legal or ethical position on it is going to be. %$* 500
andrew, can i-- %$* 13
can i stop you there, because to a degree, you made that point in your opening statement, and i don't want to suppress that point of view. %$* 13
but what i'm really trying to get at is whether the negative consequences that your opponents are talking about, do they exist, are they real, and are they simply outweighed by the interest of personal choice, or do they not exist? %$* 13
i think that a shift of this kind always has a range of social consequences, so i cannot say that they don't exist at all, but i would say that to me they are vastly outweighed by the benefits that are gained. %$* 500
okay. %$* 13
and i want to go to the other side and take this to daniel sulmasy, the issue of personal choice, which i think is very much what your opponents' essential argument is, and it's something that obviously we all enjoy and value. %$* 13
and you're making the argument that it's not the only thing that's at stake here. %$* 13
can you go on with that? %$* 13
sure. %$* 502
now, i certainly am a supporter of patients' rights. %$* 502
they have the opportunity to refuse all kinds of treatments that we give them. %$* 502
there's no need, for instance, for your mother, andrew, to have gotten the chemotherapy that she got that was making her sick. %$* 502
all those sorts of choices need to be honored and respected. %$* 502

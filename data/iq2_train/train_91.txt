and now i'd like to introduce, to set up and frame the debate, the chairman of the board of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you and welcome. %$* 1
you know, my own experience of college football consisted of attending occasional games at yale bowl. %$* 1
when i was lucky enough to have a date, she usually knew more about the game than i did. %$* 1
i was a bright, nerdy kid. %$* 1
and when i got into a position to hire people, i looked to hire people like myself. %$* 1
but with maturity and experience, i came to value a varsity football background very highly indeed. %$* 1
often that bespoke the discipline to work very hard, the perseverance to suffer defeat and endure pain, the personality to be part of a team and sometimes the charisma to lead one. %$* 1
a healthy mind and a healthy body. %$* 1
what's wrong with that ideal? %$* 1
well, nothing, except it has very little to do with college football as played at the big state colleges, the texas, georgia, florida, louisiana, michigan and the recently infamous penn state. %$* 1
these are big businesses. %$* 1
they generate profits of 40 to $50 million a year, sometimes more. %$* 1
the coaches are paid more than university presidents. %$* 1
and the athletes are offered all manner of tawdry inducements, often making a sham of their amateur status. %$* 1
they can emerge with little real education, but often with some very real brain injuries resulting in elevated risks of dementia at a young age. %$* 1
libertarians would argue that all sorts of sports and recreational activities are risky; motor car racing, downhill skiing, climbing mountains and on and on. %$* 1
and a decent respect for human liberty dictates allowing adults to assume the risks they choose. %$* 1
but query if a small-- %$* 1
if a poor high school student offered an athletic scholarship to play big-time football is making an informed choice or a mature one. %$* 1
and for the colleges, is big-time football a valuable source of funding for other athletic programs? %$* 1
is it an object of school pride that drives bigger donations from alumni and more generous funding from state legislatures? %$* 1
or is it a corruption magnet, corrosive with the meaning and purpose of the university itself. %$* 1
clearly, there's a huge public interest in these issues. %$* 1
we've rarely had a debate that was sold out so quickly or that garnered so much pre- debate publicity. %$* 1
so let the game begin. %$* 1
panelists, john, over to you. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 13
and i'd like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for-- %$* 13
yes or no to this statement, "ban college football," and jaws drop all over. %$* 13
yes, we are talking about that time-honored sport, football in the place where it first mattered, college. %$* 13
and we are talking about banning it. %$* 13
welcome to intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two. %$* 13
and for a taste of the kind of poetry and passion and pain that comes to bear when we discuss the meaning of football, i just want to give you a taste, a sample of what one nfl player wrote back in 2001 about playing through pain. %$* 13
he said, "to this day, i will encourage people to feel the knob below my neck where the collarbone was sprung free from my sternum in the middle of a game against the 49ers. %$* 13
that was pain." and he loved it. %$* 13
so are we talking about madness, or are we talking about courage when we debate the question of banning college football. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion to ban college football, buzz bissinger, a pulitzer prize-winning writer and author of the book, "friday night lights." his partner is malcolm gladwell, a staff writer at the new yorker and author of four best-sellers, among them "the tipping point." arguing against the motion, arguing not to ban college football, tim green, a college football hall-of-famer and former atlanta falcons defensive end. %$* 13
and his partner, jason whitlock of foxsports.com, national columnist and former offensive tackle for ball state university. %$* 13
our motion is, "ban college football." let's talk to our debaters. %$* 13
let's talk to our debaters. %$* 13
first, buzz bissinger. %$* 13
and buzz, in 1990, you wrote a book called "friday night lights." it is considered a classic of sports journalism about a small town, odessa, texas, and the trials of its high school team. %$* 13
it is considered by sports illustrated the fourth greatest sports book of all time. %$* 13
a movie came from it, a television show. %$* 13
and you have said that you, while critical of what you saw, you have said that you love the sport and that violence is why we like it. %$* 13
so are you on the wrong team here? %$* 13
well, i don't think so. %$* 308
i think violence is why we like it. %$* 308
and, look, nobody has ever accused me of being consistent about anything. %$* 308
i also think there's a vast distinction between what we're arguing here, which is college football versus pro players who are being compensated very, very well for what they do and know the risks going in. %$* 308
college players receive nothing beyond a scholarship that is really of questionable value because of the demands placed upon them. %$* 308
so i think what i've said is very consistent. %$* 308
all right, buzz bissinger, let's meet your debating partner, malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
malcolm gladwell who can't seem to help but writing best-selling books, "blink," "outliers," "the tipping point."in the new yorker, you've written about everything from innovation to ketchup to social media and, of course, your piece that helped inspire this debate, the one where you compared college football to dog fighting. %$* 13
you're also canadian. %$* 13
canada has football. %$* 13
is it any different in canada? %$* 13
well, the difference in canada is that we don't care about football. %$* 309
thank you, malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
our motion is "ban college football." and here to meet the team arguing against the motion in support of college football, tim green. %$* 13
now, i, earlier in the program, read a quote from somebody who said, "come touch the knob on my neck." and that was you, tim green. %$* 13
and we're all going to line up and do that afterwards, but-- %$* 13
this paean to punishment you wrote. %$* 13
i'm not touching his mouth. %$* 18
i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
you're going to go there already? %$* 310
come on, we've got to have some class on this side of the auditorium. %$* 310
jason, i totally deliberately stayed away from that line myself. %$* 13
so this paean to punishment that you wrote, what is that about? %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
why the glory of the pain? %$* 13
it's how much can you take, how much can you take and keep going? %$* 310
and i think that's one of the great lessons of the sport of football, and i think that's why it's great for our youth. %$* 310
it's great in little league. %$* 310
it's great in high school. %$* 310
it's certainly great in college because it teaches kids that life is tough. %$* 310
things are tough. %$* 310
and then you pick yourself up, and you go on. %$* 310
i think it's the greatest lesson in the game, and i think it's the greatest game that we play. %$* 310
thank you, tim green. %$* 13
and let's meet your debating partner arguing against banning college football, jason whitlock. %$* 13
and jason, you are also a former player. %$* 13
you were an all-state offensive lineman in high school and an offensive tackle at ball state university where you got a degree in journalism. %$* 13
you are on record, jason, as saying that you are in favor of paying college players to play the game. %$* 13
so if you were given the choice nowadays back at ball state, would you play for free? %$* 13
if we were playing back in the '80s, early '90s when i played, absolutely, because i thought the exchange was fair then. %$* 311
coaches and football wasn't generating as much money. %$* 311
and i was prepared to take advantage of the currency that they were paying me in education. %$* 311
not all of my teammates were. %$* 311
so yeah, i would do it all again. %$* 311
all right. %$* 13
thank you, jason whitlock. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
so this is a contest. %$* 13
and in this debate, one team will win. %$* 13
the other team will lose. %$* 13
and, our live audience, will choose our winners by your vote. %$* 13
let's go to the first round of voting now. %$* 13
the keypad at your seat will register where you stand on this motion at this point as you come in off the street. %$* 13
the motion is "ban college football." and if you agree with the motion, press number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree with the motion, number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number 3. and at the end of the debate we will have you vote a second time and at that point we will reveal the results of both numbers and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so we go in three rounds. %$* 13
the first round is uninterrupted statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
and speaking first for the motion, "ban college football," like to introduce malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
he is a new yorker staff writer. %$* 13
and, malcolm, you can make your way to that lectern. %$* 13
malcolm gladwell is a new yorker staff writer, chronicler of the counterintuitive, and author of "outliers blink" and "the tipping point." ladies and gentlemen, malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 309
i should say before we start that i haven't debated since college and that was many years ago. %$* 309
and that was in canada, and in canada a debate isn't really a debate, it's simply an alternate mechanism of reaching consensus. %$* 309
so this is all very new and exciting for me. %$* 309
i want to make one thing clear before we start and that is that this is not a debate about banning football nor is it a debate about whether there are merits to playing football. %$* 309
you will hear i'm quite sure from mr. %$* 309
green and mr. %$* 309
whitlock that all kinds of wonderful things happen when you play football, you learn camaraderie and discipline and teamwork. %$* 309
all of those things are true, and neither buzz nor i are going to dispute any of them. %$* 309
this debate is about a very specific question. %$* 309
right now in colleges across the country schools field football teams for the purpose of offering recreation to the players and offering entertainment to fans and students and alumni. %$* 309
and the question is, is that appropriate. %$* 309
buzz is going to say, "that's not appropriate because the players are exploited," and i'm going to say that, "it's not appropriate because schools should not be in the business of encouraging young men to hit themselves over the head." let's talk a little bit about hitting over the head. %$* 309
start with a very simple-- %$* 309
the simple physics of football. %$* 309
the human brain is a mass of soft tissue that is suspended within a hard skull, right? %$* 309
every time you get hit, that soft tissue rattles around inside your skull. %$* 309
and the effect of that rattling around is to stretch and sometimes tear the connections between your nerve cells. %$* 309
in the course of everyday life, that almost never happens. %$* 309
in the course of playing football, that happens all the time. %$* 309
it is not unusual in the course of a game for a player to sustain hits to the head of between 40 and 100 gs. %$* 309
to put that in perspective, if you were to get in your car and not put on your seatbelt and drive at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall so that your forehead struck the dashboard of the car, that would be a hit of 100 gs, right? %$* 309
if you reversed your car and went and did it over and over again so that you hit the brick wall 30 to 40 times at speeds between 20 and 25 miles an hour, that would be the equivalent of a football game. %$* 309
if you reversed your car and over the course of the next three months drove it at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall 1,000 times, that would be the equivalent of a college football season. %$* 309
now, you're going to hear from mr. %$* 309
whitlock and mr. %$* 309
green, they're going to try and tell you that there are ways around this fact, that if we have better rules or better treatment of concussions or better helmets, the effect of that kind of injury can be minimized. %$* 309
that is a fantasy. %$* 309
there are ways to cut down on the number of concussions, but concussions are only a small part of the problem. %$* 309
the real issue is all of those thousands of tiny hits. %$* 309
there isn't a helmet in the world that can be designed that can take the sting out of those hits, and there is no way to play this game of football and remove those hits without turning tackle football into touch football, and the last i checked this was not a debate about whether we should ban touch football on college campuses. %$* 309
i once watched a football practice at the university of north carolina where the players were playing without pads; they were just doing a simple scrimmage. %$* 309
in the course of 20 minutes, one of their running backs sustained hits to the head of 79, 60, and 30 gs. %$* 309
in 15 minutes, he had the equivalent of three car accidents. %$* 309
now, what's the effect of all of that neurological trauma? %$* 309
well, we know. %$* 309
it's a condition called, "cte," which brings about premature death and the equivalent of alzheimer's in people who are as young as 40 years old. %$* 309
i've seen pictures of the brain scans of people with cte and it looks like someone drove a truck across their brain. %$* 309
now, we don't know how many ex-football players have this condition because you can't diagnose it until they die, until you do an autopsy of your brain, but there are people who estimate there are as many as 20 percent of football players who have this condition. %$* 309
and we also know that there are players as young as 18 years old who have been diagnosed with cte. it’s a problem that begins in high school and is made worse during college. %$* 309
now, i have no problem whatsoever with grown men in full possession of the facts and risks of the game choosing to participate in a potentially lethal profession, right? %$* 309
i have no problem with people who smoke cigarettes, i have no problem with people who do deep sea diving, i have no problem with people who want to drive their motorcycle without a helmet on. %$* 309
if you want to play russian roulette with your brain, fine. %$* 309
but college is a very, very different matter. %$* 309
every single college in this country, rich or poor, big or small, is supported by the taxpayer dollars of the people in this room. %$* 309
they are subsidized by us, they are given immunity from taxes, they are supported by laws of congress, by acts of local legislatures. %$* 309
they are in every way funded by the people in this room. %$* 309
and the reason for that special relationship between us and the world of higher education is that they are charged with a sacred trust, and that is to prepare the minds of young men and women to lead lives-- %$* 309
the minds of young-- %$* 309
to lead productive lives as full citizens of the united states. %$* 309
and nowhere, nowhere, in that social contract does it say that it’s okay to promote and encourage young men to hit themselves over and over again in the head in the name of entertainment. %$* 309
thank you. %$* 309
thank you, malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
our motion is "ban college football," and here to speak against the motion, tim green. %$* 13
he’s a college football hall of famer, a former atlanta falcons defensive end, a lawyer, the author of 26 books. %$* 13
he has been called the renaissance man of sports by both sports illustrated and the la times. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, tim green. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 310
can i have the two minutes malcolm didn’t use? %$* 310
okay. %$* 310
when i was first asked to do this, i-- %$* 310
of course i asked permission from my wife, as any good husband will, and when she said, “well, you know, what’s the debate? %$* 310
”i said, “ban college football or not.” she said, “well, that’s ludicrous. %$* 310
you know, you’ll win that debate.” i said, “yeah.” she said, “you can win the debate, can’t you? %$* 310
” i said, “absolutely.” she said, “well, who are you debating? %$* 310
” i said, “buzz bissinger, malcolm gladwell.” she said, “you’ve had too many concussions.” and i have. %$* 310
and i have. %$* 310
and i agree with our opponents, mr. %$* 310
gladwell and mr. %$* 310
bissinger, in a lot of ways. %$* 310
football is a brutal game and i have grave concerns about concussions and the impact of concussions. %$* 310
i also agree that i think college football players, because of the revenues that they generate, should be paid i think a small stipend. %$* 310
i think that they deserve that. %$* 310
and so in some ways i do agree with them. %$* 310
but banning college football-- %$* 310
i mean, so i had to first-- %$* 310
i had to get over my initial horror at the notion because, of course, football for me has done a lot of tremendous things. %$* 310
and then i looked at, you know, just our country, our society in general, and i thought about football and what it does in the colleges and how it’s a unifier. %$* 310
not just the guys on the teams, not just unifying people from different places and different ethnicities and different religions into one solid unit that learns to work together, but unifying a campus, unifying the students, unifying the faculty, unifying the alumni, unifying sometimes entire towns, communities, and whole cities. %$* 310
and so, in that respect, to me, i said, you know, “how could we? %$* 310
how could we ban”-- %$* 310
college football is a wonderful thing. %$* 310
but then i wanted to look at it and i wanted to look at the numbers, because obviously my opponents are highly intelligent men, they’re passionate men, they’re very learned, and i said, you know, “what is it? %$* 310
what’s behind this? %$* 310
”and so i looked into the numbers as far as what does college football-- %$* 310
what are the benefits of college football and what are the detriments? %$* 310
well, the detriments certainly are the head injuries. %$* 310
now, i’ve got to say this because we’ve got to get things straight from the beginning about the concussions and the g-forces, because mr. %$* 310
gladwell talked about 100 g-forces when you hit your head into a brick wall at 25 miles an hour 30 times a game. %$* 310
that does not happen in a college football game. %$* 310
that does not happen in an nfl football game because when you get hit at 120-- %$* 310
at 100 gs, you get a concussion, and when you get a concussion, now more than ever, you are taken out of the game and you are put into some rehab program. %$* 310
now, back when i played, back when jason played, it wasn't like that. %$* 310
it was-- %$* 310
do you know where you are? %$* 310
no. %$* 310
how many fingers do i have up? %$* 310
four. %$* 310
okay. %$* 310
that's close enough. %$* 310
you're ready to go back in. %$* 310
it's not like that anymore. %$* 310
and so the game is evolving to become safer and safer, as safe as it can be. %$* 310
but it will never be completely safe. %$* 310
it won't be completely safe. %$* 310
so what i said to myself is, well, let me look at some things that are maybe as unsafe or maybe even more unsafe than playing the game of football. %$* 310
and so, of course, automobile accidents came to mind because the mortality rate is about a hundred times higher for men in that age range that they're going to die in an automobile accident than they're going to die on the football field. %$* 310
and then i said, well, look, how about-- %$* 310
how about going out and riding your bicycle? %$* 310
that's right. %$* 310
that's more dangerous, or downhill skiing. %$* 310
and then i said, well, let me look at sports. %$* 310
and so i went to the ncaa, and i looked at their sports, and i looked at a study that was done at the university of north carolina. %$* 310
i looked at the study of the fatalities, direct fatalities and the sports that are more dangerous than football. %$* 310
equestrian riding, female downhill skiing, lacrosse, water polo and baseball. %$* 310
and then i went to indirect fatalities, and i looked, and i found that rowing, basketball, skiing, water polo and swimming are all more dangerous than football. %$* 310
and so if we're going to say, well, football has to be banned, then i think it's only right that we pretty much have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and the safety. %$* 310
the other thing that i just have to disagree with, with mr. %$* 310
gladwell-- %$* 310
and i know this is dangerous territory for me-- %$* 310
but he talked about grown men. %$* 310
and to suggest that college football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's-- %$* 310
that's just not true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to afghanistan or wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country. %$* 310
and those are grown men. %$* 310
and so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, i think that they have the-- %$* 310
they have the right to make that decision. %$* 310
so those are the things that are maybe against. %$* 310
and i don't think that it's that dangerous. %$* 310
what are the things that are for? %$* 310
education. %$* 310
mr. %$* 310
bissinger said, well, you know, all you get is a scholarship. %$* 310
all you get is a scholarship? %$* 310
if you go to my alma mater, that's a $250,000 plus scholarship. %$* 310
that's the value of that education. %$* 310
so you do get an education. %$* 310
how many scholarship football players are there in this country every year? %$* 310
23,000. and the surplus from the game of football is used for what? %$* 310
well, maybe it is for research, maybe it is for physical but a lot of it is also used for title 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educations that they might never have had before. %$* 310
and to suggest that football and sports aren't educating, especially football, aren't educating students, i looked at that too. %$* 310
in the general population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, and it's going down. %$* 310
it's of grave concern. %$* 310
nfl-- %$* 310
college football players in the last 25 years have gone from a 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate. %$* 310
so not only are they being educated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers. %$* 310
for me, the game of football-- %$* 310
and i-- %$* 310
well, i was serious about the lessons of football on an individual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance. %$* 310
and i know my partner, jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn. %$* 310
those are wonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves. %$* 310
so i hope that you will all vote tonight to not ban college football. %$* 310
thank you. %$* 310
thank you, tim green. %$* 13
and here's a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion, "ban college football." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third, debating in support of the motion, "ban college football," buzz bissinger. %$* 13
he is a winner of the pulitzer prize for investigative reporting and author of several bestsellers, including "friday night lights," his newest book is called "father's day." it's due out on sunday. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, buzz bissinger. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 308
you know, it seems to me that given that this debate is taking place at a university that is one of the greatest and most innovative in the country that doesn't have football, i think this debate ends right now. %$* 308
our nation is at a cornerstone. %$* 308
there's no doubt about it. %$* 308
we are questioning everything, tax rate, rich versus poor, who are we? %$* 308
what are we? %$* 308
in a very intense— the most competitive global economy we have ever faced. %$* 308
and one of the things that we are looking at and must look at which makes this debate pertinent is the role of the university. %$* 308
it is pivotal. %$* 308
questions over course offerings, allocation of resources in a very difficult era as governors are slashing to the bone, dwindling money, rising tuition. %$* 308
and yet, a recent book by two sociologists, richard arum and josipa roksa says that basically undergraduates embrace college life, and it is shaped and oriented to nonacademic endeavors. %$* 308
the amount of study time has gone-- %$* 308
and this was by two labor economists. %$* 308
study time in colleges has gone from over 40 hours in the 1960s to 20 hours in the 1980s to currently 13 hours of study time. %$* 308
and i believe that at the top of what has become the university distraction, the distracted university is football, is football. %$* 308
it sucks all the air out of the room. %$* 308
the amount of money that coaches make is insulting. %$* 308
it is insulting when a coach is making five to 10 to 15 times more than a college president. %$* 308
what does it say? %$* 308
what does it say about the priorities of a university? %$* 308
it says that the head coach runs the school. %$* 308
and make no mistake. %$* 308
that was the tragedy of joe paterno. %$* 308
he did run penn state. %$* 308
he did run penn state. %$* 308
and i know he ran penn state because when graham spanier went to his house in 2004 and said, "joe, it's time to retire," he threw him out. %$* 308
they never spoke for 10 years. %$* 308
joe ran that school. %$* 308
and when it was his chance to do what was the morally right thing to do, which was to go to the police, the culture of omerta that surrounds football, he did nothing except harbor a suspected child molester. %$* 308
this is what we're dealing with in football. %$* 308
a few facts in what they call the football bowl subdivision, the big 125 schools. %$* 308
spending per student in those schools, $13,471.spending per athlete, $91,053.6.8 times as much for a student athlete. %$* 308
in the famed sec, 11.6 times as much. %$* 308
it's become a facility arms race. %$* 308
$15.2 billion spent on new athletic facilities, in particular, stadiums between 1995 and 2005.20 percent of current spending that by the way is not included in a lot of the revenue statements you'll see in ncaa reports. %$* 308
and that's not from me, that's from andrew zimbalist who is considered the leading sports economic professor in the country from smith college. %$* 308
20 percent of current spending is on facility expansion, which is wonderful except what happens if these teams stop winning? %$* 308
people will not go. %$* 308
they will not go. %$* 308
from usa today june 16, 2011, more than $470 million, more than $470 million, most of it in student fees by students who do not play sports went into subsidized college athletic programs, in particular in football. %$* 308
and this is in the era, a national trend of declining state support, tuition increases and salary freezes. %$* 308
how many football programs have cut their budgets? %$* 308
a few did in 2010, but it's back up. %$* 308
it is back up. %$* 308
it is back up. %$* 308
salaries of coaches, i mentioned it, average salary for a football coach, $1.47 million. %$* 308
that's up 55 percent in six seasons. %$* 308
a professor, 1986 to 2007, his salary went up 30 percent. %$* 308
the college president, 100 percent. %$* 308
the football coach, 500 percent. %$* 308
500 percent. %$* 308
and i defy both of you to tell me why urban meyer deserves, of ohio state, $24 million over six seasons. %$* 308
i defy you to tell me that. %$* 308
i defy you to tell me why mack brown deserves $5.192 million, not to mention the $850,000 bonus he will get. %$* 308
and i can go down the ride. %$* 308
not to mention david cutcliffe at duke, which has a terrible football program, but we're seeing $1.762 million. %$* 308
and there are all these myths, all of these myths, character, character from cbs/si poll in 2011, 7 percent of college football players, 7 percent have criminal records, 7 percent. %$* 308
2,837 players, they studied the top 25 programs, at the top of the list, pitt, pitt, 22 players on the team in 2010 have been charged with a crime. %$* 308
myth, increased alumni giving, myth, 2005, robert frank of the johnson school of management at cornell, existing empirical literature supports that success of big time athletics has little if any systematic effect on the quality of incoming freshmen in institutions able to attract. %$* 308
that's the-- %$* 308
one of the things about football is it attracts better students %$* 308
it does not. %$* 308
it attracts more applications but the students are of low caliber. %$* 308
myth, football gives back. %$* 308
untrue, untrue, and i'll go into that later. %$* 308
graduation rates, graduation rates. %$* 308
ncaa has the most ridiculous formula, the graduation success rate, now they've included the ivy league, it's ridiculous. %$* 308
and 69 percent, and what is worse, what is worse is that the racial gap between blacks and whites is despicable. %$* 308
i'm done. %$* 308
thank you, buzz bissinger. %$* 13
the motion is, "ban college football." our motion is "ban college football," and our final debater against the motion is jason whitlock. %$* 13
jason is a national columnist with foxsports.com, he's a contributor to fox sports radio, he lettered as an offensive tackle for ball state university, and he was the first sportswriter to win a national journalism award. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jason whitlock. %$* 13
see, i mean, if we lose the debate, i should be blamed because i anticipated all of their arguments and if i do it justice, i will prove how ridiculous their arguments are or just-- %$* 311
not ridiculous because-- %$* 311
no, ridiculous. %$* 18
mr. %$* 311
gladwell and mr. %$* 311
bissinger are two of the brightest minds that dabble in sports. %$* 311
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. %$* 311
i did not mean that dismissively. %$* 311
trust me, if you've read their work, if you've read their work, they do much higher end stuff than just sports, and i'm-- %$* 311
they're lending their brains to sports occasionally. %$* 311
but again, i don't mean that-- %$* 311
i mean that with all due respect. %$* 311
we need to keep him-- %$* 311
i will not match buzz's intensity or passion. %$* 311
i think i can match wits with him and mr. %$* 311
gladwell. %$* 311
keep in mind, mr. %$* 311
gladwell is a canadian and you guys are-- %$* 311
i'm not playing this for jokes, i'm being serious. %$* 311
we live in a republic, a democracy. %$* 311
capitalism is our economic system. %$* 311
the thing we value the most is freedom. %$* 311
we're american and if you believe in freedom, you can't have the free without the dumb. %$* 311
you can't have it. %$* 311
they go hand in hand. %$* 311
freedom allows you to do dumb things, things we find reprehensible. %$* 311
and i would agree, you can put football right in there with cigarettes, alcohol, porn, everything else, things that we tolerate and enjoy here in america, but you cannot separate them. %$* 311
and everything in america is connected to freedom and to capitalism and to democracy. %$* 311
and so you can't remove our institutions of higher education from capitalism and from freedom. %$* 311
you can't. %$* 311
we don't do that in america. %$* 311
we let capitalism exploit everything whether we like it or not. %$* 311
and so football has to be tolerated no different than ronald mcdonald. %$* 311
ronald mcdonald has done far more damage to america than any football coach, any of these overpaid coaches that he's talking about. %$* 311
mr. %$* 311
bissinger argues rightfully, these coaches are overpaid. %$* 311
ronald mcdonald was overpaid, hugh hefner’s overpaid, jenna jameson’s overpaid, what-- %$* 311
charlie sheen’s overpaid. %$* 311
that’s america. %$* 311
bissinger argues in the wall street journal and a little bit today that football is removed from the academic experience. %$* 311
he is wrong. %$* 311
people don’t understand football. %$* 311
many football players don’t even understand football. %$* 311
but, and i mean this respectfully, i’m not playing this for laughs, i’m not trying to be dismissive, mr. %$* 311
gladwell, mr. %$* 311
bissinger, some of our brightest minds, have not participated in football. %$* 311
and many of you in this audience have not participated in football. %$* 311
football, whether we like it or not, whether you understand it or not when i say it, but football is america. %$* 311
it is the melting pot. %$* 311
college football is the highest level of the melting pot. %$* 311
football is the statue of liberty. %$* 311
college football. %$* 311
your huddled masses, your poor, your tired, people yearning to breath free. %$* 311
i was one of those kids. %$* 311
football was my access into the mainstream and a better life. %$* 311
my dad didn’t graduate from high school, my mother was a factory worker. %$* 311
i was the first person in my family to go off to college. %$* 311
football brings the poor and the rich, the black and the white, the jews and the gentiles-- %$* 311
it brings everybody together, particularly at the college level. %$* 311
your high school experience, for the most part, is segregated. %$* 311
your little league experience is segregated. %$* 311
once you go all the way up to the pros, it’s more segregated because football is a game best played-- %$* 311
pardon, tim’s an exception-- %$* 311
by the most desperate people on the planet. %$* 311
it’s like boxing. %$* 311
that’s why so many of the football players have hard luck stories in the national football league. %$* 311
they came from nothing, they had no other choices, so they had to be good at football. %$* 311
but on the college level, everybody comes together. %$* 311
and i personally played next to-- %$* 311
i was a tackle, the guy next to me, right guard-- %$* 311
keeping it real, don’t laugh. %$* 311
the guy next to me was a bigot. %$* 311
his mom left his dad for a black man and he couldn’t get over it, and he was a bigot. %$* 311
we were very good friends. %$* 311
we’re still very good friends. %$* 311
we found common ground through football. %$* 311
college football, the bringing together of this diverse cross section of people pursuing one goal. %$* 311
if they understood it on college campuses, they would teach college football, they would come and study college football and learn things so that-- %$* 311
i’m a part of the media. %$* 311
i watch our major broadcast media and i watch the clueless, people that don’t have the diversity of experience that i have through college football and through life and i watch them consistently tear this country apart. %$* 311
i watched them do it with george zimmerman, oj simpson, rodney king. %$* 311
whatever the big media story. %$* 311
barack obama. %$* 311
consistently tear this country apart. %$* 311
the reason why-- %$* 311
and if people have ever read my column and understood my perspective, the reason why i never lose faith in america is because of my college football experience. %$* 311
i have seen people of different backgrounds overcome tremendous differences to compete for one goal. %$* 311
that’s what we allegedly are trying to do here in america. %$* 311
i think the argument to ban college football is being argued by well-intentioned people who don’t clearly understand the sport. %$* 311
america is imperfect. %$* 311
the statue of liberty does not promise perfection. %$* 311
our constitution doesn’t promise perfection. %$* 311
we pursue perfection. %$* 311
college football needs to be reshaped, remade, less games, less practice, less padded practice-- %$* 311
share some of the money with the coaches. %$* 311
it does not need to be banned. %$* 311
i’m sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
jason-- %$* 13
it does not need to be banned. %$* 311
your time is up. %$* 13
let’s give a round of applause. %$* 13
thank you, jason whitlock. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now we go onto round two, which is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two who are arguing out this motion, "ban college football." arguing for the motion, we’ve heard from buzz bissinger and malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
they’re arguing that college football is something like a kind of toxic spill in this society. %$* 13
they make two kinds of arguments, one, the medical argument that it abuses the players, hurts them physically, literally is rattling the brains in their heads, and a financial argument that college football twists universities' priorities so that these schools are less in the education business than they are in the football business, that in these-- %$* 13
on those campuses, football becomes a distraction. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, jason whitlock and tim greenfield, they both played in college, and they are arguing that football is a great unifier for the players and for schools. %$* 13
for the schools, they provide identity and loyalty. %$* 13
for the players as individuals, they provide character and discipline and a shot at education that many of them may not have had. %$* 13
and they also dispute almost all of the medical claims made by the other side. %$* 13
so we want to have them mix it up now. %$* 13
and i want to go to the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
your opponents are making a very broad philosophical argument that college football, as it stands now has no place on university campuses because it makes the schools more about football than it does about education, that this actually causes harm-- %$* 13
you make the argument that it's good for the players. %$* 13
they're making the argument, maybe so, but it's bad for everybody else because it just messes up what the school is supposed to be about, messes up the finances. %$* 13
and they broke this down to a very specific question: why should these coaches be making millions of dollars and millions of dollars more than the president of universities? %$* 13
why shouldn't they be making millions of dollars more? %$* 310
why-- %$* 310
i mean, this is america. %$* 310
and jason said it. %$* 310
this is a country where we allow pop stars and rappers and hedge fund managers-- %$* 310
we allow people to make whatever the market determines that it should make. %$* 310
and i don't understand why we would begrudge anyone any amount of money-- %$* 310
wait. %$* 309
that’s your defense, that hedge fund managers are just as bad? %$* 309
at this point can’t we declare the debate over? %$* 309
what i'm saying is i don't-- %$* 310
i wouldn't begrudge-- %$* 310
i don't begrudge you the revenues from your wonderfully successful books or buzz, "friday night lights." we're all big fans. %$* 310
i don't begrudge you that. %$* 310
whatever you get is what you get. %$* 310
and whatever the market determines, that's what you earn. %$* 310
buzz bissinger. %$* 13
i understand, but first of all, these are not for profit institutions. %$* 308
second of all, athletic departments are notoriously bureaucracy heavy, notorious. %$* 308
ohio state has an athletic department of 478 people which is twice as much as the english department at ohio state. %$* 308
so let's face it. %$* 308
it ain't about capitalism because they're nonprofit institutions. %$* 308
they're not responsible to stockholders. %$* 308
plus, the knight foundation, which has studied football and sports more than any entity in the country in the past 20 years has said there is absolutely no correlation between a winning record and the amount of a coach's salary. %$* 308
you talk about what's wrong-- %$* 310
tim green. %$* 13
with football with academics, right? %$* 310
you talked about-- %$* 310
yes. %$* 308
13 hours a week studying. %$* 310
guess how many hours a week football players study? %$* 310
20. %$* 308
40.40 hours a week. %$* 310
i talked about the graduation rate-- %$* 310
40 hours a week what? %$* 308

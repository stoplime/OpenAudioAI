i believe that’s because information workers here are not unionized and they do not have to worry about the right to work, the advantage of the south, so that they go and do google and the center of gravity will be up there. %$* 463
on the other hand i think that creates hyper-wealthy super classes, not the sort of people that you want-- %$* 463
that will benefit from ta thriving middle class such as you would find in texas and the energy states. %$* 463
let’s let michael lind actually come in and respond to that. %$* 13
yeah well i didn’t mean that housing and affordability is not important. %$* 465
but the point is the one time once in a century housing asset bubble that took place in the blue states, in britain, in spain, and the various parts of the world, that greatly inflated the cost of living in the blue states for macroeconomic reasons, which had nothing to do with policy one way or another. %$* 465
as the housing sector deleverages, you’re going to see a decline in relative housing, not in point tower neighborhood, you know, not in the most desirable part of california, not in central park west, but in other blue states. %$* 465
so what you seem to be suggesting is “yes we’ll accept these other legacy features of which are detrimental in the blue states-- %$* 465
i mean the red states, worse educational outcomes, worse health outcomes and all of that, but you get bigger houses.” if that’s going to be your argument that is a tragic trade off, where you have to trade cheaper housing for worse health care and worse education. %$* 465
you shouldn’t have to trade that. %$* 465
but michael in terms of a dynamic, in terms of education, your opponents pointed out that, in texas for example, that the scores are rising among minority students. %$* 13
that in fact things are moving in the right direction very rapidly, and that in the blue states the reverse is happening. %$* 13
now that’s a compelling argument. %$* 13
that’s not the case in general across the blue states, and certainly not across the red states. %$* 465
they cherry picked one statistic. %$* 465
if you look at graduation rates, for example, in terms of education. %$* 465
the number of blue states with percentage of adults 25-34 with a college degree, the top are massachusetts, north dakota, a red state with energy, minnesota, new york, new hampshire, california, iowa, etc. %$* 465
only north dakota is a red state. %$* 465
of the bottom 10 there are only two blue states in the bottom 10. %$* 465
all right so stephen, is your side’s education argument undone? %$* 13
look you have to then defend the schools in the inner cities, right? %$* 464
i mean how do you explain the abysmal schools in detroit, in chicago, poverty in new york, in boston, i mean the inner city-- %$* 464
and this is really i think one of the fundamental flaws of their argument. %$* 464
if the blue model worked then detroit wouldn’t be bankrupt right? %$* 464
because there are no republicans in detroit. %$* 464
it is a city that for 50 years has been ruled only by liberal democrats. %$* 464
and one of the things i had warned you of is that if you want to move to these blue states, you know, one of the things that they have in those blue states that we haven’t even mentioned yet, is gargantuan unfunded liabilities in their pension. %$* 464
you want to talk about the legacy cost, look at the legacy cost of these blue states. %$* 464
so if you were to move from a red state to a blue state, you are basically condemning yourself and your kids to have to pay a huge amount of your taxes just to pay for the cost of the last 20 or 30 years for retired public workers where you get nothing in return for your tax dollars. %$* 464
you’re saying the blue states are doomed, essentially? %$* 13
i absolutely-- %$* 464
i think-- %$* 464
look, the blue states either have to change or die. %$* 464
become red. %$* 13
they are like east berlin, they are like east germany, and they’re like-- %$* 464
again it’s the trend question, gray david. %$* 13
yeah, listen i believe you have to prove your worth every day. %$* 183
and i give my opponents credit for pointing out some modest increases in performance in texas and other states, but in california 33 percent of the residents have a college degree, in texas 25 percent. %$* 183
talking about the future, the future is being invented in silicon valley, it is not being invented in the southern states, in the plain states, and it’s because of great research universities. %$* 183
alan greenspan told me “you have something no other state has. %$* 183
13 research universities. %$* 183
cal tech, stanford, sc, 10 uc campuses. %$* 183
those states create whole new economies. %$* 183
invest in those states.” i raise the research and credit from nine to 13 percent, and to 20 percent if you use the universities. %$* 183
that is why there’s just a bubbling cauldron of academic innovation marrying up with venture capitalist and entrepreneurs that keep california current and at the leading edge. %$* 183
hugh hewitt-- %$* 13
lets-- %$* 13
you know what they don’t have-- %$* 464
just one quick thing. %$* 464
what they don’t have-- %$* 464
you’re actually right. %$* 464
there is a lot of entrepreneurial high tech stuff, you know what’s disappearing rapidly from california is manufacturing, and that’s because-- %$* 464
we are the leading manufacturing state in america by jobs, and the leading factory state by-- %$* 183
you’re losing them by droves. %$* 464
by $230 billion dollars. %$* 183
you’re talking about infinitesimal change. %$* 183
we are a colossus here, not perfect. %$* 183
sometimes great, sometimes a failure, but little incremental achievement here does not substitute the extraordinary impact that technology has had on our life and technology is driven largely by the blue states, massachusetts and california. %$* 183
hugh hewitt. %$* 13
i want your vote, and i want your vote based on this thought. %$* 463
when stephen illustrates, perhaps a little bit over the top with the north korean explanation, but what he illustrates-- %$* 463
what he's talking about is the inability of california to change its institutions. %$* 463
they're not doomed. %$* 463
they are bankrupt. %$* 463
they are functionally bankrupt. %$* 463
and the inability to change is because there are super majorities in the state legislature and this occurs in new york and in massachusetts and other doomed blue states to bankruptcy. %$* 463
doomed to bankruptcy. %$* 463
illinois, %$* 463
hugh, why is that their blue state-ness? %$* 13
because they've done deals with public employee unions that cannot be paid for. %$* 463
they've written checks that cannot be paid for, except three generations down the road; there are scores, hundred, thousands of six-figure retirees at the age of 50 in california, governor, and i'm sure you can speak to this. %$* 463
it wasn't your fault. %$* 463
you inherited a lot of it, but you've got prison guards walking around at six figures that people have to pay for and the lifespan, and michael, one quick response, we don't have to worry about those uninsured, right? %$* 463
didn't obamacare fix that? %$* 463
michael lind. %$* 13
actually, obamacare-- %$* 465
they took it out of the system. %$* 463
they could log on. %$* 463
let's hear from michael lind. %$* 13
well, i'm not here as a partisan democrat or a defender of the president. %$* 465
i am a defender of the interests of the ordinary people of the red states who are overwhelmingly working class and poor. %$* 465
what we have heard from stephen is that if you are a wealthy enough person to be concerned about progressive income taxation, it's better to live in a red state. %$* 465
if you're a business whose business model is not based on r&d and it's also not a locally-based thing like starbucks that has to be done there, but it's a footloose business that depends on nonunion labor, like labor-intensive chicken plucking, for example, in that case you'd be better off in a southern red state than in a northern or western blue state. %$* 465
i agree. %$* 465
that's why arkansas leads the world in labor-intensive chicken plucking. %$* 465
but that is not your typical 21st century business. %$* 465
let me take you something-- %$* 13
one more point about the taxes. %$* 465
yeah. %$* 13
if you are poor in texas, you pay 12 percent of your income in taxes, because texas, like other southern states, relies heavily on regressive payroll-- %$* 465
regressive property and sales taxes. %$* 465
if you're rich in texas you pay 3 percent. %$* 465
now, what kind of society is it where the poor people pay four times as much of their income as the rich people? %$* 465
it's a libertarian ideal. %$* 465
if you want to get rid of all taxes on the rich and on inheritances and have nothing but a flat tax, but that has a cost, too, in addition to housing-- %$* 465
but, michael, you just said that the middle class people are moving to texas. %$* 464
so, if it's so horrible there in texas with the taxes, why do they move there? %$* 464
and the answer to that question, by the way is j-o-b-s.that three-letter word that joe biden always talks about. %$* 464
jobs are in those states, and that's where-- %$* 464
let's hear-- %$* 13
i want to hear michael-- %$* 13
it's a great question, actually, and i want to hear michael's answer to it, too. %$* 13
yeah, and the answer to that is f-r-a-c-k. they are not moving. %$* 465
all right. %$* 464
i have to address that. %$* 464
you are not seeing california and new york and massachusetts emptying out to go to the flourishing business districts of arkansas and of mississippi. %$* 465
all right. %$* 13
just one second, stephen. %$* 13
if you took out the energy sector from the red states, what do you think you would be left with? %$* 13
well, we have had studies since the crash of 2009. this was reported recently in "u.s.a. today.” the largest contributions to income in the red states in the last few years have come from two things, energy-- %$* 465
my question was slightly different. %$* 13
and federal food stamps for poor southern states. %$* 465
my question was slightly different. %$* 13
if you took out the energy sector, what would happen to the flow of population toward the red states away from the blue states? %$* 13
well, we saw this when the texas energy bubble burst in the early 1980s, and there was a reversal to the midwest. %$* 465
okay, i want to go to stephen moore. %$* 13
stephen moore. %$* 13
first of all, michael, thank you. %$* 464
this is the first time in about five years i've had a liberal talk about how great fracking is, because you are absolutely right. %$* 464
fracking is changing america overnight. %$* 464
we tripled our energy resources overnight, because of this incredible american ingenuity. %$* 464
now i am not going to let the two of you get away with saying it's just happening in these states-- %$* 464
these red states, because they have energy resources, because guess what, ladies and gentleman? %$* 464
guess what state other than texas has the most energy resources of any other state? %$* 464
california. %$* 18
california. %$* 464
california does. %$* 464
california has five billion barrels of oil in the monterey shale. %$* 464
what is different about texas than california? %$* 464
i wrote an editorial about this a few weeks ago. %$* 464
texas is proud to be an oil and natural gas state. %$* 464
california is embarrassed by it. %$* 464
if that's how you create jobs, why in the world, governor, won't you allow fracking? %$* 464
why isn't the state going full speed ahead? %$* 464
california used to be the second most energy producing state in the country. %$* 464
it has been surpassed by north dakota and other states because they choose not to do it. %$* 464
texas-- %$* 464
i mean the state of california, to give you a sense of how crazy they are in sacramento, they actually passed a cap and trade bill, which is basically putting a tax on your own industry. %$* 464
now i don’t care what your opinion is on global warming, whether you think it’s going, you know, the greatest apocalypse for the earth, there’s nothing california can do to change the global temperature-- %$* 464
i know gray davis is going to want to respond to that and i’m going to let you in one second. %$* 13
i want to go to-- %$* 13
i have one more question then i want to go to audience questions after that and i just want to remind you if you raise your hand and if you can stand up and just tell us your name, it can be first name, it’s fine with us. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you or i might ask depending on where you’re sitting, because of where our cameras are located to go to a stand in the aisle. %$* 13
so gray davis, if you’d like to respond to that? %$* 13
yeah, two things, we dropped all the way from second to fourth, steven so we’re still in the top five. %$* 183
the governor has come out in favor of fracking done responsibly, so has obama, this is a great opportunity to rid of ourselves of dependence on the middle east and whether you’re republican or democrat, you should be for responsible exploitation of our natural gas and oil resources and that’s what we’re doing in california, but i do want to make this point: that why do so many people live in blue states? %$* 183
are they all misguided? %$* 183
are they all getting it wrong? %$* 183
they’ve lived there because they have more opportunity, they make more money, they’re healthier, and they enjoy their lives more. %$* 183
do we have high taxes and regulation? %$* 183
yes, but the outcomes are positive otherwise people would move so a margin-- %$* 183
a little .9-- %$* 183
.009 percent people moving here, moving there are just white noise. %$* 183
the fact is blue states are the makers, red states are the takers. %$* 183
almost every red state in america gets more than 100-- %$* 183
no, i don’t mean that in a negative sense, i mean that in the sense of romney, because romney was talking about who takes, who makes the blue states produce gdp, the red states get more money back from the federal government than they send to washington. %$* 183
for example, texas ranks 11th in money back from the federal government, california, 32nd. %$* 183
we make it on our own. %$* 183
and so those statistics actually hold up in terms of where the federal dollars come and go. %$* 13
so i want to go to hugh hewitt, your opponents have now depicted the red states as states that depend on one industry, energy, which if it were gone would blow up the whole thing and that it’s depending on a sort of flow of federal dollars that come more into the red states and the red states the other way. %$* 13
so they’ve taken two reasons that the red state vision you’re depicting is a little bit of a fantasy or is running on fumes-- %$* 13
without both of those things it’d be a different world. %$* 13
i’d just like you to respond to those points. %$* 13
sure, i’m amused by the idea that we can’t count energy, that’s like saying engines don’t matter to cars. %$* 463
they’re there, they’re fixed and they will be there for a very long period of time. %$* 463
it’s like saying california greatest advantage, which is its coast, its extraordinary coast, its harbors, its ability to tap into the pacific rim which they have not damaged. %$* 463
in fact governor davis did quite a lot to advance international trade, that’s its natural advantage and they use that. %$* 463
they do not use their energy but i don’t think we can penalize states that use their energy resources and i’ll also say this, the states which are technically blue but operationally red, michigan, pennsylvania, and my home state of ohio are in fact going to become red over the next 30 to 40 years, which are a time frame that i think we’re talking about the future, we think of our children, our grandchildren. %$* 463
i think you look out there and you see that they become energy producing states. %$* 463
their governors are adopting free market enterprise solutions, and that they will be the future because they’re going red not blue and those under class that you worry about michael, rightly, are going to have greater opportunities to advance under what arthur brooks put forward as earned success but you’re saying-- %$* 463
so you’re saying that you don’t want to entertain the hypothetical question of what the red states would be without energy because the energy is there? %$* 13
well, because your kid has to actually move my framework, you got to pick a place to live, you got to go. %$* 463
we don’t remove the energy boom that steven refers to accurately as the most transformative single event in the economy of the last 50 years. %$* 463
you can’t factor it out for the purposes of the debate. %$* 463
and gray davis’s point also on where federal dollars come and go, hugh? %$* 13
well that’s a variable, federal dollars will not be there for much longer unless we want the country to go as bankrupt as california is. %$* 463
just one quick point about oil and gas-- %$* 464
steven moore. %$* 13
just a really quick point, michael, if you take the oil and gas sector out of the u.s. economy over the last five years, guess what? %$* 464
there’s no recovery at all-- %$* 464
i’m exaggerating a little bit but about 90 percent of the growth of the u.s.economy is due to the oil and gas sector, and by the way that’s under a president who hate fossil fuels. %$* 464
i mean the ultimate irony of this president is he will have presided over the biggest oil and gas boom in the history of this country. %$* 464
so how can you take the oil and gas boom out? %$* 464
i mean one other quick thing, you know, in new york, we’ve been talking about a lot of california-- %$* 464
in new york, governor, they did actually pass a ban on fracking. %$* 464
and you know what, the marcella shale goes into new york, upstate new york in places like syracuse and places like rochester that really need those jobs. %$* 464
so in pennsylvania what they’re doing is the drilling down, they’re going horizontally-- %$* 464
stephen. %$* 13
underneath new york-- %$* 464
stephen. %$* 13
and they’re taking out all their oil and gas and love it-- %$* 464
stephen i just need-- %$* 13
stephen i need you to be interruptible more. %$* 13
because you’re vivacious, and energetic and it’s great, but i-- %$* 13
it’s just in terms of the clock if we had the big clock you would have many more stephen minutes right now than michael lind minutes, so let’s let michael then respond please. %$* 13
i’m glad to find a point of consensus among us. %$* 465
but you seem to have discarded the theory that you had for most of this debate, which is that the key to economic growth is low personal income taxes on business, rather than regulations that allow fracking. %$* 465
so i’m glad that we agree on this. %$* 465
we will continue to disagree about whether absence, the-- %$* 465
geographic accident of energy resources in your state border, the traditional southern low wage, low tax, low investment model is going to lead to prosperity or another century of southern stagnation. %$* 465
let’s go to some questions from the audience and-- %$* 13
but wait, john that’s like absent air, that-- %$* 464
absent-- %$* 464
that’s the whole thing is the ability to go get it. %$* 464
hugh-- %$* 13
do the radio thing, 30 seconds go. %$* 13
if you say absent energy you are creating a world that does not exist. %$* 463
everything depends on-- %$* 463
energy is freedom, it’s everything. %$* 463
gray very quickly. %$* 13
yes hugh was talking california banking, hugh you’re about five years behind the time. %$* 183
all the rating agencies have upgraded california. %$* 183
jerry brown’s got a lot of credit for taking a $26 billion deficit-- %$* 183
i created about $10 billion and it got worse in between-- %$* 183
and eliminated that through $11 billion worth of cuts, economic recovery, and the $6 billion temporary tax that the people voted on themselves. %$* 183
so he’s gotten high marks for getting us out of the mess. %$* 183
he will keep us out of the mess, because there is no more frugal a man. %$* 183
when i was his chief of staff, i came into his office, i said “by the way this hole in your rug is a little unseemly.” about this big, there was a hole in the rug. %$* 183
“so i’ve asked general services to fix it.” this is the 70s. %$* 183
he said “you did what? %$* 183
” “well the governor can’t have a hole in his rug.” he said “do you understand this hole has saved us $600 or $700 million. %$* 183
people can’t come in here and pound on my desk and say, “give me money for mental health, give me money for this” if we have a hole in the rug.” so i guarantee you while jerry brown is governor california’s finances are going to be just fine. %$* 183
ma’am your question? %$* 13
yes linda childers. %$* 19
if you were going to start a foundation would you locate it in a red or a blue state? %$* 19
what a great question. %$* 13
that’s sort of the “where would you send your kid? %$* 13
” question, but with some money behind it. %$* 13
let’s take it to hugh hewitt first. %$* 13
first i’d ask adam myerson, my old friend, about that. %$* 463
but my guess is that you want-- %$* 463
if you were going to start it you would probably go to a blue state, to an intellectual capital. %$* 463
i want to be very honest here. %$* 463
that’s not the proposition before us, but i think you would want to go to one of the great intellectual capitals. %$* 463
there are some contenders in the red states, but i think probably they are overwhelmingly located in los angeles, san francisco, washington d.c., and new york. %$* 463
i have to say i have to congratulate you for not just taking that and turning a point into is, but for sometimes conceding that the other side has advantages is really in the spirit of what we’re trying to do here, so it was great to not hear just hear a talking point. %$* 13
i just want to say thanks. %$* 13
it’s nice that we can make that concession. %$* 18
so you’ve been working with fox lately right? %$* 13
just one really quick point, i don’t know about setting up a foundation, but if you’re someone with wealth you sure as hell don’t want to die in a blue state, or they’re going to take 10 percent of your money. %$* 464
so die in a red state. %$* 464
that would be such a great motion. %$* 13
“if you ought to die” %$* 13
if i have it right “live it in a blue state, but before you die move to a red state.” %$* 463
let’s hear a response from the other side on the foundation question. %$* 13
gray davis? %$* 13
well, i just want to invoke the wisdom of hugh and rest my case. %$* 183
set it up in a blue state. %$* 183
i have nothing to add to the deathbed migration theory of the foundation factor. %$* 465
i still congratulate hugh hewitt for saying what he said. %$* 13
are there are any other questions. %$* 13
yes ma’am please go ahead. %$* 13
i’m sorry mic’s not. %$* 13
one more time. %$* 13
heather, who admits to living in manhattan. %$* 19
the question is for michael and your contention that what we’re seeing is no different than the historical difference between northern and southern states for the blue and the red states. %$* 19
jonathan haidt in his book “the righteous mind” makes the point-- %$* 19
and he’s a liberal democrat-- %$* 19
that “the great problem with the liberal project is that it starts with very good intentions, but never sees the unintended consequences cost” in human capital and economic consequences of these projects. %$* 19
is it not the case that what we are finally seeing is over the time of the progressive project in these blue states, well intended as they may be, that those chickens are finally coming home to roost, and that is what is making the difference between the red and the blue states? %$* 19
michael lind. %$* 13
well i think there are deep flaws within the progressive liberal project as there are within the conservative project and the centrist project, but i don't think that explains the difference. %$* 465
the real difference-- %$* 465
it goes back to the fact that we haven't raised yet, which is this has really been two countries for most of its history. %$* 465
you had the slave states and then later the segregation of states, and they just fell behind. %$* 465
in 1900 the difference in per capita income between the south and the north was greater than between czarist russia and victorian britain. %$* 465
and we've become a much more integrated nation state since then, but you just have a long way to go. %$* 465
and my concern, as a native of the red states, is that the south in particular can get trapped in a permanent semi-developed status if it has an essentially parasitic strategy of trying to use low taxes and anti-union laws to lure businesses from old, more developed parts of the country. %$* 465
we saw what the textile industry-- %$* 465
this can work for a time. %$* 465
in the 20th century, the carolinas, other southern states, lured the textile industry, which was actually created in massachusetts in the northeast. %$* 465
once you have a global economy there's always a mexico. %$* 465
there's always a china. %$* 465
and then with china wages go up you lose factories to vietnam and thailand. %$* 465
so i don't think any states of the union in the 21st century can count on a race to the bottom where we have lower wages than you do. %$* 465
i think all of the states have to have a race to the top. %$* 465
this is one of my fundamental disagreements-- %$* 464
to michael and that kind of left-wing thinking. %$* 464
they think it's worse to have, you know, no job at all at $14 an hour than a lot of jobs at $9 and $10 an hour. %$* 464
and i just disagree with that. %$* 464
i don't think that. %$* 465
i think one of the problems with, you know, the effects-- %$* 464
i think california just raised its minimum wage. %$* 464
there are a number of blue states that are raising their minimum wage. %$* 464
what they're essentially doing is pricing out of the market low-wage jobs. %$* 464
they're going to have higher unemployment rates and, by the way, when you do that what you do is you take away the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, because we all started-- %$* 464
i don't know about you, hugh, but my first job was a minimum wage job at $2.60 an hour, but that was maybe one of the most valuable jobs i had. %$* 464
i just disagree with that philosophy. %$* 464
ma'am, do you-- %$* 13
there's no such thing as a bad job. %$* 464
ma'am, do you feel that your question was just addressed? %$* 13
i'm to the other side. %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
your question was are the chickens coming home to roost for the blue states, and michael started with that but moved in a different direction. %$* 13
i think it's a great question and i'd like to take it to you, hugh. %$* 13
well, i will answer the question with a question, which i will direct to the governor. %$* 463
governor, is the california teachers association a force for the good? %$* 463
are you going to run for a public office again? %$* 463
no. %$* 183
i'm not going to run for public office again, so-- %$* 183
i will be honest. %$* 183
i think we all can remember a teacher or a professor in our lives that sparked our imagination, that helped set us on a different course of action. %$* 183
i remember speaking to my history teacher, who was also my baseball coach when i was in the tenth grade, and i wasn't making the baseball team. %$* 183
i didn't think he even noticed me and he came up to me and he says, "gray davis, you could actually make something out of your life if you just had a little drive and ambition, but you're such a happy-go-lucky kid, i just don't know what's going to happen to you. %$* 183
but if you just get your act together things could be fine. %$* 183
here's my home number if you have any problems with your homework. %$* 183
call me.” %$* 183
and he was a union member? %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 183
no, no. %$* 183
he was not in the union. %$* 183
oh, he was not? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
no union at the school. %$* 183
i just wanted to keep it on point. %$* 13
but my point is i was so blown away that someone was taking an interest in me outside of my family that i understood the power of mentorship and the power of someone believing in you, and there's no substitute for that. %$* 183
okay, but it doesn't actually answer the question. %$* 13
oh, it did. %$* 463
yes it did. %$* 463
i'll tell you. %$* 183
teachers are very important. %$* 183
associations and unions obviously fight for better members, for better pay and better conditions. %$* 183
sometimes i agree with them. %$* 183
sometimes i didn’t. %$* 183
my first year i put in the high school exit exam, the academic performance index. %$* 183
in august of my first year, teachers’ unions were running commercials against me saying “we thought this guy was for education. %$* 183
we don't think he is.” i raised the amount of money that went into education by 30 percent. %$* 183
no governor ever has done that. %$* 183
no governor will be able to do that again. %$* 183
so, i rest my case. %$* 183
so i understand the difference between helping education, telling every kid that they can get better, measuring their progress, and paying the price for it with teacher unions. %$* 183
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion: "for a better future, live in a red state.” sir. %$* 13
i'm frank baxter, a fourth generation-- %$* 18
sir, actually, you're one of the folks-- %$* 13
we would appreciate it if you could-- %$* 13
because of where our camera angles and the light, sorry, if you wouldn't mind just going down the aisle towards where that gentleman is standing and then we will-- %$* 13
the camera can see you and you can start again and thank you for that. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
i'm frank baxter, a fourth generation californian, and i think that with other californians, that it’s a wonderful place to live if you’re rich, live on the coast. %$* 18
if you’re poor and live in the valley where the unemployment rate is 30 percent, where less than half of the children statewide graduate from high school, where we pay the lowest amount per pupil of any state except mississippi, where we’re cutting back-- %$* 18
sir, could you just go to a question, thanks. %$* 13
and the question is, are the blue states a good place for the elite, but where the poor people are oppressed? %$* 18
i want to handle that. %$* 183
gray davis. %$* 13
first of all, ambassador, i want to commend you because you have done more to start charter schools in south central los angeles-- %$* 183
on a bipartisan basis and you know when i was governor we were very close together for more charter schools to make sure they got money out of construction bond issues, and to give them opportunities to succeed so my point is good people will find ways in which to improve a challenge educational system and it doesn’t mean that you have to move to a red state. %$* 183
if you’re good-- %$* 183
you can do it in a red state but-- %$* 183
but governor, i’m only interrupting because we have very limited time and i want to keep on point but his question was is the state better for the elite then for everybody else’s? %$* 13
is california set up that way? %$* 13
i mean obviously elites will do well wherever they are, but california and other blue states work very hard to see that children, minority children have advantages, have extra training afterwards, after school programs, and there is evidence that the gap between minority students and majority students is closing. %$* 183
it’s a constant struggle, you have to be ever vigilant, but progress has been made. %$* 183
is it a difficult challenge? %$* 183
yes, but i don’t think it’s unique to blue states and it’s not unique to red states. %$* 183
i was going to ask your partner, michael lind, is that phenomenon unique to blue states and then i want to go this side. %$* 13
no, and part of the problem with this debate is we have to limit ourselves to state borders. %$* 465
if you actually look at a county by county basis what you have is very affluent blue cities including blue cities in texas like austin and dallas and houston, which are increasingly liberal and very, very affluent. %$* 465
of course it is the case that as areas develop then the middle class and the working class sometimes get forced out because of the cost of living. %$* 465
that is not necessarily a bad thing, because it’s better than not developing at all. %$* 465
and in fact i think there’s good inequality and bad inequality. %$* 465
good inequality is when the wealthy elite is there because they’re entrepreneurial and they’re inventing something. %$* 465
bad inequality of the kind that’s all too familiar in the south is because of a lack of bargaining power on very low income people who have very little leverage compared to their employers. %$* 465
so you know there’s a downside to northern california being the head of the tech industry with billionaires driving up prices and then driving out the middle class, but i would rather be in a state that has that problem than in the other kind of state. %$* 465
okay, i want to take-- %$* 13
i’ve let this side answer two speakers in a row. %$* 13
you can have two speakers in a row if you want but i’m interested in your answer to the same question. %$* 13
is california an example of a state that’s very, very-- %$* 13
it’s great if you’re rich and it’s not so great if you’re not? %$* 13
hugh hewitt. %$* 13
absolutely it is, the agony of the urban core in california is pronounced. %$* 463
that agony is everywhere in every urban setting but it is more pronounced in the super cities. %$* 463
i’ve spent thursday morning last with father gregory boyle who has been running homeboy industries in south central los angeles for 24 years i believe. %$* 463
he’s buried 183 gang kids over the course of his ministry. %$* 463
it is a tough, tough place to be poor, it is a wonderful place to be rich. %$* 463
steven moore, do you want to take it on or move on to-- %$* 13
my statistics show this and by the way unfortunately it’s not just happening now in blue states. %$* 464
you know we are now in the fifth year of recovery, the most animated feature of this recovery is the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. %$* 464
exactly the opposite of what the president wanted to have happen. %$* 464
by the way, i have nothing-- %$* 464
there’s nothing at all wrong with people getting rich. %$* 464
someday i want to be rich myself, but you know the fact is that this has been a dreadful, dreadful recovery for low income people and that’s because we have adopted kind of liberal blue state policies on a national level that have reduced opportunities for those at the bottom. %$* 464
so it sounds like for the purposes of this debate on that point, this is a wash. %$* 13
that none of the red states nor the blue states are better off in this regard. %$* 13
hold on, i just want to make this quite clear-- %$* 464
steven moore. %$* 13
but the blue states make it worse because they take obama’s policies and then add on to them like when california raised their minimum wage. %$* 464
when you raise your minimum rage, you hurt your lowest skilled workers, so you make your poorest workers poorer. %$* 464
we raise our minimum wage-- %$* 183
gray davis. %$* 13
because we’re trying to lift all votes. %$* 183
you may think it’s cool to live on $9 an hour, but we’re trying to allow to be a little better than that. %$* 183
economic literature shows that if there are bad effects, they are slight compared to the greater income the people with the new minimum wage have. %$* 465
it is simply not the case. %$* 465
conservatives and libertarians for 30 years have argued there would be mass unemployment if you raised the minimum wage-- %$* 465
the us raised the minimum wage every few decades. %$* 465
the mass unemployment has not materialized. %$* 465
the mass unemployment we have now, and the weak recovery is not the result of george w.bush, under whom it started, nor is it to be blamed on barak obama. %$* 465
we had the greatest global depression in fact since the 1930s. %$* 465
we call it the recession. %$* 465
this is a global phenomenon that we’re working out over many years. %$* 465
and i just think it’s just kind of petty and partisan to blame it on one president who is being stymied in congress by filibusters and-- %$* 465
he didn’t invent the minimum wage, but the pernicious effects of the minimum wage on the underclass are pronounced. %$* 463
and that is where it’s most devastating. %$* 463
sir? %$* 13
wait, wait. %$* 13
ma’am, i’m moving on to other audience members with respect, just so that we can bring in some other voices. %$* 13
can you tell us your name? %$* 13
yeah i’d like to-- %$* 18
paul marrow i’d like to ask a question that’s a little bit different play on the previous question. %$* 18
i’m from utah where we have a very strong middle class statewide. %$* 18
and as my wife and i were driving in from long beach airport to here we got to kind of this hilly area is, and she says boy you don’t want to live on this side of the hill, do you? %$* 18
you want to live on this resort side of the hill. %$* 18
and so for me, i want to ask specifically does a strong middle class play into your motion? %$* 18
what does the middle class have to do with your motion? %$* 18

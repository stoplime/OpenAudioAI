and we always begin them by having bob rosenkranz come to the stage and talk about our thinking in putting this debate on at this time and what’s at stake. %$* 13
so please, one of these moments, a round of applause for mr. %$* 13
bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 13
so, you know, we’re doing one of these strategy debates. %$* 13
it’s one of those, probably for a lot of people in the audience and myself, it’s one of those learning debates where we’re going to learn from both sides. %$* 13
but you, we were talking before-- %$* 13
earlier in your career, you worked for the rand corporation out in santa monica thinking strategy. %$* 13
during the period of the cold war-- %$* 13
and just what-- %$* 13
you know, in terms of helping us understand what we mean when we say “nuclear strategy.” %$* 13
well, i was at rand in the ‘60s when it was the epicenter of research and thought about nuclear strategy. %$* 1
and, you know, it’s been 70 years since a nuclear bomb was used in war. %$* 1
but in spite of that passage of time, it still has a great deal of relevance as a strategic construct. %$* 1
and in rand’s view then and, frankly, in my view now, the biggest relevance of nuclear weapons is really as a deterrent because countries that possess nuclear weapons can-- %$* 1
can pursue a more aggressive projection of power and a more aggressive foreign policy than they might be able to do otherwise. %$* 1
so if you look at a case like iran, and very often iran’s leaders are disparaged as crazy and nuts, but for them to want to deter, have a weapon to deter doesn’t seem entirely irrational. %$* 13
no. %$* 1
i would argue that it’s not irrational at all. %$* 1
and if you do a thought experiment, imagine if saddam hussein had nuclear weapons when he went into kuwait or prior to 9/11. %$* 1
he would probably still be in office today. %$* 1
so having nuclear weapons does have a strategic value even if they are extraordinarily unlikely to ever be used. %$* 1
so do we think, then, iran, if it gets a weapon, would be not so likely to use it? %$* 13
well, i think the strategic issue is not so much their likelihood to use it because i suspect that they would be deterred by the specter of a counter attack from whomever they used it against. %$* 1
but the more relevant thing is that having nuclear weapons would embolden them to pursue even more aggressively the clear policy that they have of being a revolutionary power in a pretty dangerous neighborhood. %$* 1
i mean, they’re using hezbollah and hamas to project power. %$* 1
they’ve, in effect, destabilized iraq. %$* 1
they are a revolutionary power that seeks regional dominance. %$* 1
in terms of their apparently moving towards making this deal, they get in return now the lifting of sanctions, money. %$* 13
does that have-- %$* 13
is that an asset that, for them, could have as much value as the deterrent power? %$* 13
well, absolutely. %$* 1
and i think the point is that while they might be emboldened by having nuclear weapons, they would also have a much greater ability to project power in the region if the sanctions were lifted because their economy would be much stronger, they’d have much more revenues from oil. %$* 1
they’d have much more investment in their society. %$* 1
the people ruling it would probably be in a stronger domestic position. %$* 1
so, i think that as we listen to tonight’s debate, at least i’m going to be listening not just about whether or not they get nuclear weapons, but whether or not they are in a stronger or weaker position as a result of this deal to in effect act as a regional hegemon and adversely to the u.s. interests. %$* 1
so looking at the whole range of the deal, it’s a very thorny issue. %$* 13
and we have four great debaters to take it on for us, so let’s thank bob rosenkranz and bring our debaters out to the stage. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
and this again is one of those times to formally begin the evening. %$* 13
once more, if you could give a round of applause for bob rosenkranz buying time, that is what president obama’s deal with iran on nuclear weapons does in the first instance. %$* 13
in a sense it’s getting iran to lay aside its activities related to its ambitions to build a nuclear weapon for a set number of years and then the deal ends. %$* 13
it’s kind of like having a kid put his firecrackers up on the top shelf, and you can take them down a few years later maybe with the hope that at that point the kid isn’t going to want to blow things up anymore. %$* 13
and maybe the hope is that in time iran will evolve in such a way that it won’t be a threat to its region. %$* 13
that may be what buying time can deliver. %$* 13
nobody loves this deal, but the white house argues that it is better than nothing and better than all of the alternatives. %$* 13
but is it? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let’s have it, “yes,” or, “no,” to this statement, “obama’s iran deal is good for america,” a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, all firecrackers, on our stage here at the kaufman center in new york to argue for and against this motion, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion again, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” let’s welcome the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome philip gordon. %$* 13
and, philip, you are a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations, but until very, very recently you were at the white house working on these issues. %$* 13
you were a coordinator for the middle east, north africa, the gulf region, a senior advisor to the president. %$* 13
you have been pretty busy and pretty intimately involved with these negotiations the-- %$* 13
whose conclusions we’ll be talking about tonight. %$* 13
we want to know, you know, since you were so close to it, is there anything that you can tell us about being inside the process that would shed some new light on these negotiations? %$* 13
new light, john, i can. %$* 334
after many, many rounds, more than i can remember, of difficult contentious negotiations, i can share with you the insight that people that haven’t slept for five or six days at a stretch get very irritable-- %$* 334
of all nationalities. %$* 334
have you slept before coming here tonight? %$* 13
just before coming here. %$* 334
you just caught up? %$* 13
all right, ladies and gentlemen, philip. %$* 13
hopefully i’m not irritable. %$* 334
hope so, too. %$* 13
philip gordon. %$* 13
and, philip, can you tell us who your partner is? %$* 13
yeah, my partner is one of america’s finest and most experienced diplomats, ambassador tom pickering. %$* 334
ladies and gentlemen, tom pickering. %$* 13
tom, you are also arguing for the motion that, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.”you’re vice chairman of hills & company, and you have had, as philip just said, a long career, five decades as a u.s.diplomat. %$* 13
you were undersecretary of state for political affairs and ambassador to the u.n.you were ambassador to moscow, israel, nigeria. %$* 13
for a number of years, though, in the absence of any formal u.s.-iran relations, you were a participant in what is called, “track ii diplomacy.” for those who are not familiar with the term, “track ii,” can you explain briefly what that is? %$* 13
short answer is, one more than track i. the long answer: it’s non-officials engaged in diplomacy to see if they can find a way to crack the nut. %$* 335
from the inside, we’ll be hearing some of that. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome please tom pickering-- %$* 13
and the side arguing for the motion, and that motion is, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and we have two debaters arguing against it. %$* 13
please, let’s welcome mike doran. %$* 13
welcome back your second time debating with us. %$* 13
you are a senior fellow at the hudson institute, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, a former senior director in the national security council, also an insider in this process. %$* 13
you helped devise and coordinate a lot of u.s.strategies on middle east issues, including efforts to contain iran. %$* 13
you recently tweeted this, “in-- %$* 13
” 144 characters-- %$* 13
“in obama-land, the kiss of the nuclear deal will turn the iranian frog into a beautiful prince,” but don’t you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince? %$* 13
they’re kissing a lot of frogs. %$* 140
it’s true. %$* 140
they’re kissing a lot of frogs? %$* 13
yes. %$* 140
and you’re against that? %$* 13
i’m against that, yes. %$* 140
okay. %$* 13
we’re going to hear why. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mike doran. %$* 13
and, mike, tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
my partner is actually a foreigner. %$* 140
he’s a canadian. %$* 140
he’s my favorite canadian, but he’s also the executive director of the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 140
he’s martin dubowitz, and he’s one of the leading experts on everything financial to do with iran: sanctions-- %$* 140
everything i was going to say. %$* 13
so, let me just cut through the same place-- %$* 13
and mark dubowitz. %$* 13
known to his friends as “dubo.” mark dubowitz is arguing against the motion “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and mark, as just pointed out, you’re with the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 13
your think tank has been described as the political brain trust on iran sanctions so much so that a few years back, a white paper that you co-wrote was adopted by the obama administration, largely without them changing it very much. %$* 13
but they don’t seem to be listening to you now. %$* 13
are they off your mailing list? %$* 13
that is true. %$* 336
that is true. %$* 336
we keep sending them ideas, and the white house keeps saying, you know, “iran sanctions are just so yesterday.” %$* 336
here tonight is your chance-- %$* 13
because i’m sure they’re listening-- %$* 13
to change their minds. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it’s a contest of ideas, well-presented. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers change the most between two votes of our live audience here in new york will be declared our winner. %$* 13
that is to say, we have you vote before the debate, and once again, after the debate, on these motions. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let’s have you register your preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads at your seat-- %$* 13
again, the motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you’re undecided, push number three. %$* 13
the other keys are not live; you can ignore them. %$* 13
and if you make a mistake, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and to remind you one more time, we will reveal the results of this vote you’re doing now at the end of the debate, at the same time as our reveal of the second vote. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared the winner. %$* 13
okay, it looks everybody’s-- %$* 13
it looks like everybody’s good. %$* 13
let’s move on to round 1.round 1 are opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and here to go up first for the motion to the lectern, phil gordon. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations. %$* 13
he was special assistant to the president and white house coordinator for the middle east, north africa, and the gulf region. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, philip gordon. %$* 13
all right. %$* 334
thanks very much, everybody. %$* 334
thanks for coming. %$* 334
i’m really pleased to be here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by tom pickering. %$* 334
also glad to be up here with mark and mike. %$* 334
they play an important role. %$* 334
we disagree on this subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate. %$* 334
let me get straight to the point. %$* 334
tom and i are going to argue that the iran deal of president obama is good for america for three basic reasons. %$* 334
one, it’s important for the united states to stop iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. %$* 334
two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and unpredictable conflict. %$* 334
and three, the alternatives to this deal-- %$* 334
the alternatives to this deal are far worse. %$* 334
and i’m going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third point, because i suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have x, y, and z. %$* 334
what i don’t think you’ll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it. %$* 334
and i remind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, “is this a perfect deal that you would write alone if you didn’t have to negotiate it with somebody else? %$* 334
” but “is it good for america? %$* 334
” and i think if that’s the question, it clearly is. %$* 334
in fact, i don’t even think it’s much of a close call. %$* 334
the first point, i’ll be very brief on. %$* 334
the united states has an interest in stopping iran from getting a nuclear weapon because an iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten the region and some of our close allies, including israel. %$* 334
it could be a precedent and a stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons. %$* 334
and it would be harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region. %$* 334
i just want that to be clear. %$* 334
i don’t think our opponents disagree with that, so i would just want to stipulate it upfront. %$* 334
that doesn’t require a debate. %$* 334
it is important for the united states. %$* 334
what we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that. %$* 334
and tom and i will assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why it’s good for america. %$* 334
the framework agreement that the obama administration negotiated cuts of all of the possible paths for iran to get a nuclear weapon. %$* 334
now, in this brief opening statement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of every provision in the agreement. %$* 334
i suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it. %$* 334
what i would do is underscore some of what this agreement does. %$* 334
and i would ask you to think about it in these terms: imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement. %$* 334
think about those two alternatives-- %$* 334
alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to live in, which one is good for america. %$* 334
i said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an iranian nuclear weapon. %$* 334
there are three basic paths: enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, using plutonium to create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path. %$* 334
and this agreement stops all of those tracks. %$* 334
on enrichment, what does the agreement do? %$* 334
with the agreement, iran would have to take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is around 10,000 kilograms or 12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, as we discussed this, and get rid of 98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms. %$* 334
without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like. %$* 334
with this agreement, they would have to get rid of two-thirds of their installed centrifuges. %$* 334
today they have 20,000 installed centrifuges. %$* 334
with this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years. %$* 334
and they would all have to be the oldest technology, the least efficient. %$* 334
without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges they like. %$* 334
with the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an underground facility called fordow and they could only keep nonoperating centrifuges there. %$* 334
without the agreement, they can use fordow for whatever they like. %$* 334
with the agreement, iran couldn’t use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 years and would have long-term limits on research and development. %$* 334
without the agreement, they can do whatever r&d they want and develop more advanced centrifuges very quickly. %$* 334
with this agreement, iran could not enrich uranium to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the israeli prime minister was here in new york a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing. %$* 334
so if you enrich uranium to 20 percent, it’s a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it for a bomb. %$* 334
the interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent stockpile, this agreement requires iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, closes off all the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb. %$* 334
it also closes off the plutonium path. %$* 334
with the agreement, iran has to get rid of its current heavy water reactor at a place called arak and replace it with one that would not produce any weapons-grade plutonium at all. %$* 334
and it couldn’t do any reprocessing. %$* 334
it has to ship the core out and can’t use this site. %$* 334
without the agreement, they can finish production of that heavy water reactor and start producing weapons-grade plutonium. %$* 334
finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path. %$* 334
with this agreement in place, iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections, forever, with a mechanism for resolving disputes. %$* 334
we would have access to their entire fuel cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a regular basis. %$* 334
that’s what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this agreement. %$* 334
without this agreement, we don’t have any of that, and we have no idea what iran is up to. %$* 334
the bottom line of all that, when you put it all together, is iran’s breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it. %$* 334
i could go on, but you get the bottom line point. %$* 334
when you compare these two worlds that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this agreement is good for the united states. %$* 334
indeed, i think it’s not even a close call. %$* 334
when tom takes the floor-- %$* 334
i’ve made the positive case for this agreement. %$* 334
when tom takes the floor, he’ll be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a good agreement, but all of the potential alternatives to it are much, much worse. %$* 334
thank you very much. %$* 334
thank you, philip gordon. %$* 13
and our motion is obama’s iran deal is good for america. %$* 13
and here to debate against this motion, mike doran. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the hudson institute and former national security council senior director for the near east and north africa. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mike doran. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 140
thank you, john, and thanks to all of you. %$* 140
it’s fantastic to be here. %$* 140
there’s nothing more wonderful than central park in the springtime except the iq2 debate. %$* 140
now, as you know, we’re going to argue-- %$* 140
mark and i are going to argue against. %$* 140
we think this is a very bad deal. %$* 140
let me just get right to the point. %$* 140
to me, this is like-- %$* 140
say you’re a legitimate businessman, and a mafioso comes and you’re in a little bit of-- %$* 140
you’re in a little bit of trouble financially, and he offers you a loan, and you take it, and you tell yourself that this is a temporary thing and that as the mafioso becomes your partner, over time, he’s going to moderate, he’s going to understand what it’s like to get honest profits, and he’s going to change, and he’s going to start abiding by the law. %$* 140
this agreement would be fantastic if we were making this agreement with denmark, but we’re not. %$* 140
we’re making it with iran. %$* 140
we know iran well. %$* 140
we’ve known them for 35 years. %$* 140
we know what they’re like. %$* 140
the iran that we have today is the iran that we had 10 years ago. %$* 140
it’s the iran that we had 20 years ago. %$* 140
it’s the iran that we had 35 years ago. %$* 140
and that’s-- %$* 140
that is actually the single most important question that i want to put to you tonight is, why do we think that this regime is going to abide by this agreement? %$* 140
that’s the-- %$* 140
that is the single most important-- %$* 140
the single most important question, and the administration never, ever-- %$* 140
never ever talks about it. %$* 140
now, there are two stories out there that are being told. %$* 140
one is the story that the obama administration is telling, and the other story is the one that our allies in the middle east are telling. %$* 140
the story the obama administration is telling us goes something like this: back in-- %$* 140
back in april of 2013, there was an election in iran which brought to power this guy rouhani, who is a reformer. %$* 140
and rouhani wanted to change relations with the west. %$* 140
he wanted to change all of this enmity and conflict between iran and the west. %$* 140
and so he started this negotiation with the americans, and he made some very important concessions to the americans, concessions that they had never made, along the lines of the ones that phil was talking about, basically the essence was a willingness to constrain their nuclear-- %$* 140
their nuclear program. %$* 140
and that then has led to this process that we have here before us today. %$* 140
that’s not the story that our allies are telling. %$* 140
they’re saying that this process is not the result of a strategic change in iran. %$* 140
it’s the result of a strategic change in washington. %$* 140
the united states-- %$* 140
the united states started this process with major concessions. %$* 140
it ripped up six security council resolutions that called for zero reprocessing and zero enrichment. %$* 140
it gave iran, in the first step, as part of the interim agreement, it gave it the right to enrich, and it said also that the restrictions on its program would be temporary, right? %$* 140
so the negotiation after that-- %$* 140
after the initial interim agreement and the negotiations were over how long would that period of temporary restriction be? %$* 140
and under what-- %$* 140
how big would the restrictions on the-- %$* 140
on the program be? %$* 140
and what would iran get in return? %$* 140
now, just for signing up to the interim agreement, we started paying iran $700 million a month. %$* 140
we’re paying them to negotiate with us. %$* 140
we’re going to-- %$* 140
when they sign the deal, we’re going to give them $50 billion right up front and shortly thereafter and additional $70 to $90 billion. %$* 140
now, when you ask john kerry, what’s the evidence that there’s been a strategic change on the part of the iranian regime? %$* 140
he says, “well, look, they signed the interim agreement, and they have negotiated for over a year now with us, and they have abided by the terms of the interim agreement during this period of negotiation.” we paid them to do that. %$* 140
we paid them to do that, and we have dangled out a big prize at the end of this signing bonus and the relief from-- %$* 140
and the relief from all sanctions. %$* 140
so, of course, they’re going to be-- %$* 140
they’re going to play nice at the negotiating table. %$* 140
what other evidence do we have other than the fact that they have allowed us to pay them to negotiate with us, that they have made a strategic shift? %$* 140
no evidence whatsoever. %$* 140
they still are the-- %$* 140
they still spout the same anti-semitic rhetoric, they still call for the destruction of israel, they still destabilize their neighbors. %$* 140
they still have four americans who are hostage there. %$* 140
they have a marine, they have a cleric, they have a newspaper reporter, and they have a former fbi agent. %$* 140
they didn’t even have the-- %$* 140
they didn’t have-- %$* 140
they didn’t even have the grace and the good manners to release the hostages during this-- %$* 140
during this negotiation. %$* 140
now, mark and i are going to divide our duties here. %$* 140
mark is going to explain to you why all of those characteristics of the deal that phil went through are basically a fiction, why it’s a fantasy to think that any of this-- %$* 140
that the iranians will abide by any of these-- %$* 140
by any of these terms that phil mentioned. %$* 140
i am just going to make a couple of statements about the broader problem of the deal in the region. %$* 140
mark’s going to talk about the nuclear breakout. %$* 140
i’m going to talk about the regional breakout. %$* 140
we are turning-- %$* 140
with this deal, we are turning iran into the regional hegemon in the middle east, all right? %$* 140
we have turned a blind eye to the expansion of iranian power in iraq, in syria, in yemen, and elsewhere across the region. %$* 140
and when we hand them $50 billion a few months from now, if, in fact, we do, we’re going to see an expansion of those-- %$* 140
an expansion of those activities. %$* 140
that’s one problem. %$* 140
another problem is we have set off with this deal a regional nuclear arms race. %$* 140
the saudis have said openly, explicitly, that they are going to match the iranians capability for capability. %$* 140
they’re not going to wait for this deal to end before they start developing their own capability, and they have made that explicit. %$* 140
there’s no way to deny, absolutely no way to deny, that there is not a regional nuclear arms race underway right now. %$* 140
the other thing is this deal does not make the united states any safer. %$* 140
one of the things that has been left off the table, not part of the negotiations, is the illegal ballistic missiles program of the iranians. %$* 140
so before long we’re going to have an iran-- %$* 140
a nuclear iran with a ballistic missile capability capable of hitting the united states. %$* 140
a good deal, a good deal-- %$* 140
and this is what we need to define-- %$* 140
a good deal is one that stops iran from getting a nuclear weapon, a; b, makes our allies in the region feel safer and stabilizes the region; and, three, makes the united states safer. %$* 140
this deal does not meet that basic criteria. %$* 140
thank you. %$* 140
thank you. %$* 13
michael doran. %$* 13
and a reminder of what’s going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing for and against this motion, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” you have heard the first two opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i’d like to welcome to the lectern tom pickering. %$* 13
he is vice chairman of hills & company. %$* 13
he has served as undersecretary of state for political affairs and as ambassador to the u.n.and several countries, including russia, israel, and jordan. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, tom pickering. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thank you for your warm welcome. %$* 335
it’s a pleasure to be here with phil and also with mike and mark. %$* 335
i have much i think to say tonight in a very short period of time, and i will do what i can to compress it. %$* 335
not too long ago when he was still alive, daniel patrick moynihan said famously that, “you’re each entitled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts.” tonight from mr. %$* 335
doran we’ve heard an extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts. %$* 335
so let me just cover a few of those that i think will be helpful to your understanding of the arrangements that we have to deal with. %$* 335
first and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the moment of signature. %$* 335
the truth is, of course, that until iran complies with four major requirements of the deal-- %$* 335
that they put their centrifuges aside; that they change their stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms; that they, in fact, dismantle the central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium; and that they agree on that the past efforts that they made in a nuclear direction, in a nuclear weapons direction, are fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the international atomic energy agency-- %$* 335
they get nothing out of this deal. %$* 335
no sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to iran. %$* 335
secondly, the notion that iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money, the opportunity to play havoc in the middle east is both strange and unusual. %$* 335
certainly we watch carefully what iran does. %$* 335
and none of us have undertaken the notion that the iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse of the agreement for narrow political advantage. %$* 335
were the iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, they would have far done it well before any receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that they’re doing in the region are high enough, i think, for them to continue to do that. %$* 335
it is important, too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement. %$* 335
both sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority. %$* 335
obviously, a missile-- %$* 335
ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of threat that has been portrayed to you here. %$* 335
and there are plenty of opportunities in the next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that particular effort. %$* 335
now, let me turn, if i can, to the key questions, and they’re important to all of us here. %$* 335
you’ve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop any iranian nuclear weapon. %$* 335
that’s stipulated and agreed. %$* 335
it’s important, however, to understand that the second question-- %$* 335
is this a good deal for america-- %$* 335
is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of reasons that phil set out for you. %$* 335
and the third question is, what are the alternatives to this deal? %$* 335
well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two: no deal at all, or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal. %$* 335
you heard from mr. %$* 335
doran that he would like to have zero enrichment. %$* 335
i would like to have zero enrichment, too. %$* 335
i’d like to be a billionaire. %$* 335
i’d like to believe in the tooth fairy. %$* 335
but for 14 years, previous administrations attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere. %$* 335
and the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspection mechanisms, and with all of its limitations on iran, and that’s extremely important to keep in mind. %$* 335
in addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement? %$* 335
how and in what way would that affect the situation? %$* 335
it would affect it very badly. %$* 335
we would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating. %$* 335
the notion that we could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality. %$* 335
it’s not there and it’s not the third question is, what would happen in the event we had no agreement. %$* 335
iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon. %$* 335
they would have two to three months to breakout time. %$* 335
they would, if they-- %$* 335
they’re so inclined, use that opportunity, as we have a 10-year agreement with a 15-year limitation on the production of more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to hold them in place, and i think that’s important. %$* 335
finally, i think it’s significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in negotiating-- %$* 335
a good agreement. %$* 335
if we were to use force, it would mean, i think, from the best judgment that i can get of military officials, a three to five-year cessation in the iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now. %$* 335
and a situation under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the iranians under that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure. %$* 335
to me, there is no alternative. %$* 335
this agreement is a good one. %$* 335
i hope that you will consider that carefully. %$* 335
and when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order for the right set of arrangements that president obama has put before you. %$* 335
thank you very much. %$* 335
thank you, tom pickering. %$* 13
the motion is obama’s iran deal is good for america. %$* 13
and here to argue against the motion, mark dubowitz. %$* 13
he is executive director of the foundation for defense of democracies, where he also heads its center on sanctions and illicit finance. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mark dubowitz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 336
great. %$* 336
well, thank you very much, john, phil, tom, mike. %$* 336
it’s really a pleasure for this canadian, want-to-be-american, to be in such distinguished company. %$* 336
i’m very humbled to be here. %$* 336
i’m going to discuss the emerging deal’s seven deadly flaws. %$* 336
i support a good deal, but this is not a good deal. %$* 336
i’m also going to suggest to you that this deal will make war more likely, not less likely. %$* 336
and i’m going to actually take phil up on his challenge, and i’m going to sketch out what a better deal looks like. %$* 336
the seven deadly flaws: first of all, president obama and his administration only about 18 months ago committed to, quote, unquote, “dismantle substantial portions” or “a lot” of iran’s nuclear program. %$* 336
this deal will leave iran’s nuclear infrastructure virtually intact. %$* 336
and iran will be a turn of the screw away from developing a nuclear weapon, only a year’s breakout from that weapon. %$* 336
and that year breakout will only last for 10 years. %$* 336
thereafter, the breakout time will diminish significantly, and by year 15, iran will have zero breakout, that’s undetectable breakout. %$* 336
number two, the administration gave up on long-standing u.s.policy and multiple un security council resolutions, and they gave iran domestic enrichment which is the key element it needs to develop a nuclear weapon. %$* 336
now, that was fine, except this most valuable concession wasn’t given up at the end of the negotiation in exchange for other valuable concessions. %$* 336
no, this was given at the beginning of the negotiation, before iran had really done anything significant. %$* 336
and now we’re in a situation where iran is going to have significant enrichment capacity. %$* 336
the administration started off by offering 500 centrifuges. %$* 336
now iran’s going to have 6,000 centrifuges. %$* 336
that’s a 1,200 percent increase in the course of these negotiations. %$* 336
well, here’s a fun fact for you: 6,000 centrifuges, woefully inadequate if you want peaceful nuclear energy. %$* 336
but it’s exactly what you need if you want to weaponize uranium. %$* 336
number three, we’ve heard about missiles quite extensively from the folks over here. %$* 336
let me just talk about an icbm, an-- %$* 336
intercontinental ballistic missile is not for putting monkeys into space. %$* 336
it is for delivering a warhead to new york city. %$* 336
and the iranians said that this was non-negotiable. %$* 336
the administration said, “fine. %$* 336
we’ll take it off the table.” number four, the fordow enrichment facility. %$* 336
this is an enrichment facility that is buried under a mountain on a revolutionary guard military base. %$* 336
the administration promised to dismantle it, then to shutter it. %$* 336
and now it’s going to be left open for 15 years to develop medical isotopes. %$* 336
it’ll be the most heavily fortified, heavily guarded medical isotope facility in the milky way. %$* 336
and the problem is, in 15 years’ time, the iranians can reconvert it to do advanced centrifuge powered enrichment in a heavily guarded, underground bunker underneath a mountain. %$* 336
number five, and this is the serious issue with this deal. %$* 336
it’s the poison pill. %$* 336
many of the restrictions on this deal are going to start sunsetting, in other words, disappearing, after year 10.and by year 15, most of these restrictions are going to go away. %$* 336
iran is going to have an industrial sized military program, with unlimited centrifuge capacity, zero breakout, multiple heavy water reactors, and the ability to actually develop a program that is widely dispersed and very, very difficult to verify. %$* 336
this deal would have converted this iranian regime, this regime, from a nuclear pariah into a nuclear partner. %$* 336
let me talk about verification and inspection because i believe our opponents are going to bet their debate and bet the security of the united states of america on verification and inspection. %$* 336
this is the idea that we will have unprecedented inspections. %$* 336
well, the problem with unprecedented inspections is that ali khamenei, iran’s supreme leader, just last week said, “you are not getting into my military bases, into my revolutionary guard bases.” revolutionary guard commander said anybody who tries is going to be met with hot lead. %$* 336
i looked up “hot lead” in the dictionary. %$* 336
it means a bullet. %$* 336
now, that’s a serious problem because this is a bet on verification and detection. %$* 336
and let’s talk about the u.s.track record in detecting and stopping countries from going nuclear. %$* 336
we missed the soviet union, china, india, pakistan, israel, north korea. %$* 336
we underestimated saddam’s program in 1990.then we overestimated his program in 2003 and went to war to stop a nonexistent wmd program. %$* 336
we have a lousy record of detecting when countries go nuclear. %$* 336
and this is going to be a massive program on a territory more than twice the size of texas. %$* 336
that is what the iaea will have to verify, particularly when this is an industrial sized program. %$* 336
number seven, and finally, the iaea doesn’t enforce. %$* 336
they verify, they monitor. %$* 336
the united states of america enforces. %$* 336
now the only way we’re going to enforce this deal peacefully is through economic coercion, what is known as snapback sanctions. %$* 336
here’s the problem with snapback sanctions. %$* 336
they don’t snap back very well. %$* 336
iran will have a powerful economy in 10 to 15 years. %$* 336
they’re going to get hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief. %$* 336
they’re going to be increasingly immunized against future economic pressure. %$* 336
we’re going to end up in snapback disputes with the russians and the chinese at the security council. %$* 336
in fact, we’re going to end up in snapback disputes with the europeans when we try snapback sanctions against our french and british and german friends. %$* 336
we will hit a wall of intransigence at the security council, and we will hit a wall of human greed in the marketplace. %$* 336
and the problem is as we give up our peaceful enforcement mechanism in order to enforce the deal, this is going to make war more likely, not less likely. %$* 336
iran will be able to creep out, or inch out, or sneak out, or they’ll wait patiently until many of these restrictions disappear. %$* 336
and if we are lucky enough to detect an iranian sneak-out or breakout, war will be our only option. %$* 336
and when that war comes, iran will be much stronger, and the consequences will be much worse. %$* 336
now, what about a better deal? %$* 336
well, let me spell out a better deal in seven quick points. %$* 336
number one, no sunset provision based on arbitrary time period. %$* 336
iran should have to be certified by the iaea as having a peaceful nuclear program without any clandestine nuclear facilities. %$* 336
number two, no long range ballistic missiles capable of carrying a warhead. %$* 336
number three, shut down the fordow facility. %$* 336
there’s only one purpose, and that is for weaponization. %$* 336
number four, go anywhere, go any time, snap inspections into any revolutionary guard base. %$* 336
number five, iran has been stonewalling the international community on its possible military dimensions of its program. %$* 336
iran should come clean before the deal, not after a deal, and certainly before we give them hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. %$* 336
and number six, economic leverage. %$* 336
it should not be dependent on sanctions. %$* 336
president obama said no deal is better than a bad deal. %$* 336
that is not this emerging deal. %$* 336
let’s take time to negotiate a better deal. %$* 336
why are we rushing towards a bad deal? %$* 336
my bet, compared to obama’s deal, hillary’s deal will be much better. %$* 336
in fact, compared to obama’s deal, the leading republican contenders will have a better deal. %$* 336
hillary and the republican contenders are the ultimate snapback. %$* 336
that’s why you should vote against the proposition that obama’s deal is good for america. %$* 336
thank you. %$* 336
thank you, mark dubowitz. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” all right. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
again, we’re going to have you vote right afterwards. %$* 13
and i’ll say this one more time. %$* 13
the team-- %$* 13
well, i’ll probably say it many more times. %$* 13
the team whose numbers change the most between the two votes is how we declare our winner. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
our motion is this: obama’s iran deal is good for america. %$* 13
we have heard philip gordon and thomas pickering arguing for the motion by saying that this deal is not perfect, but that it will contain iran’s nuclear ambitions, that it cuts off all paths to its ability to construct a bomb in a short period of time. %$* 13
they would not be able, they say, to sneak one through the system. %$* 13
they say not having an agreement in place in the near future leaves iran with a freehand to do whatever it wants, that it would be a staggered deal, that iran doesn’t get everything up at once, but it’s through stages of give and take and that a deal that-- %$* 13
that gives the u.s. everything that it wants, to aspire to that is like wanting to believe in the tooth fairy. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, michael doran and mark dubowitz, argue that there’s just no reason to think that the leadership in iran is going to abide by the terms of any deal and that it’s going to change soon; that the united states gave away way too much, way too early in the negotiations, that there is only a future in both ends of this deal in which iran just becomes a bigger power in the region and more of a troublemaker. %$* 13
they have issues with the temporariness of this deal, the fact that 10 to 15 to 20 years from now we would be back where we started. %$* 13
and they point out that basically this deal leaves iran’s nuclear infrastructure essentially intact and that it can be revived with the turn of a screw. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that’s arguing for the motion, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and in a very broad sense, gentlemen, your opponents, they seem to be making an argument that at best, you’re naive, that you-- %$* 13
you’re not-- %$* 13
i don’t think they’re saying you’re willing to trust, because it sounds like you’re not willing to trust. %$* 13
but you trust in the mechanisms of the deal and that you’re just putting way too much hope in bad guys who know how to cheat. %$* 13
why don’t you take that on, philip gordon? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 334
i will start. %$* 334
but, frankly, i don’t know where to start, given what we heard about this agreement, speaking of tooth fairies. %$* 334
i don’t get all of my predictions right. %$* 334
i’m probably wrong most of the time. %$* 334
but when i stood up there a few minutes ago and predicted that what we wouldn’t hear was an alternative path to get somewhere, instead we just hear a litany of the things that we would love to see if we could write it ourselves, i got that prediction right. %$* 334
and, mark, i think you misunderstood my challenge. %$* 334
my challenge wasn’t to describe a better deal. %$* 334
i can describe a better deal, and you did a great job of it. %$* 334
i love your deal. %$* 334
i’d sign it right now. %$* 334
i can describe the salary package that tom would have if he was a billionaire. %$* 334
i can’t do is tell him how to get there. %$* 334

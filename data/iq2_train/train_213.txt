and i'd like to introduce the gentleman who makes all of this responsible, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
good evening and welcome. %$* 1
you know, several years ago an intelligence squared audience voted against the motion, quote, "better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11." i was personally surprised by the vote. %$* 1
but after speaking with audience members, i understood that most people's only experience with counterterrorism is airport security. %$* 1
they take a dim view of it. %$* 1
didn't want those responsible for it to have any additional powers. %$* 1
today's headlines about the tsa's new scanner and pat down proceedings only seem to validate that point. %$* 1
so clearly getting airport security right is important, not just for its own sake, but for the sake of public attitudes toward counterterrorism efforts generally. %$* 1
profiling has the appeal of simple common sense. %$* 1
we know that the vast majority of terrorists are muslim males ages 15 to 30 from a handful of countries and ethnicities. %$* 1
homeland security services have scarce resources. %$* 1
if they don't target the resources they've got efficiently, they're not doing their job, and they're undermining public support for their mission. %$* 1
well, the counterargument is that this sort of profiling cuts deeply against bedrock american ideals. %$* 1
alternatives such as full body scanners in the news today and behavioral profiling are both more effective and less discriminatory. %$* 1
perhaps the vast majority of terrorists fit a distinct profile. %$* 1
but the vast majority of travelers who fit that profile are not terrorists. %$* 1
treating them as if they were encourages resentment and anti-american attitudes. %$* 1
to succeed in the long run, our efforts need to diffuse those attitudes, not create them. %$* 1
so which is the more persuasive view? %$* 1
we have some extraordinary panelists with us this evening to help you decide. %$* 1
but before i turn the evening over to our moderator john donvan, i did want to note that ticket sales cover only a small fraction of the cost of presenting this program. %$* 1
there are a substantial number of charitable foundations and friends who support our efforts as your program notes. %$* 1
and as your own thoughts turn to holiday giving, why not considering joining our friends group or perhaps giving a series subscription to some of those on your gift list. %$* 1
well, that's my pitch. %$* 1
and now, john, over to you. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
and just as in fact the main benefactor of this program is the rosenkranz foundation, i just invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
true or false, u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling. %$* 13
that is what we are here to debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on npr stations across the nation for this intelligence squared u.s.debate on the proposition u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling. %$* 13
we have two teams of three members each arguing for and against. %$* 13
and they're not necessarily who you would think. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, for example, a woman whose brother died as a pilot on flight 77 that crashed into the pentagon is here to argue against the motion. %$* 13
also the gentleman who was the second secretary of the department of homeland security. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, our team includes an american muslim woman who certainly would be one of those pulled off the line if we went into profiling, or at least the male members of her family. %$* 13
so it's not necessarily who you would think. %$* 13
also, we think that you will be surprised by the level of some of the debate. %$* 13
the point here is really that this is a contest, a contest of a well-argued idea, a verbal joust. %$* 13
and you, our audience, are here to listen and to act as the judges. %$* 13
i would like you now to go to the key pads at your seat and register your position on this motion. %$* 13
u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling. %$* 13
your position as you come in off the streets before you've heard any of the arguments. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will register your last vote. %$* 13
and we'll be able to present that vote towards the end of the debate. %$* 13
. .0 %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
once again, as i'm saying, you the audience are the judges. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the arguments and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round one, opening statements by each team in turn. %$* 13
and i would like to introduce as he rises from his table and heads to his podium, deroy murdock. %$* 13
he is a syndicated columnist with the “scripps howard news service,” media fellow at the hoover institution. %$* 13
like me, he does a lot of traveling on airplanes. %$* 13
and deroy, have you been in the system lately? %$* 13
john, i was in the system last night when i flew back from nashville. %$* 556
have you experienced your first pat down? %$* 13
well, i have not yet. %$* 556
and i guess that may come up at some point in the future. %$* 556
but let me be clear, john, if you touch my junk-- %$* 556
ladies and gentlemen, deroy murdock. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 556
let's begin with a thought experiment. %$* 556
just imagine that you work at jfk international airport here in new york city, and you're in a federal express facility inspecting incoming packages that have just been pulled off of a jet that's landed from heathrow airport in london. %$* 556
and you're clearing these parcels that can be taken on across america and delivered to their destinations. %$* 556
and you see a package from somalia, and it's addressed to a synagogue in san francisco. %$* 556
"hmm," you think to yourself, "that's kind of unusual." so you call over your supervisor, you take a look at it, you discuss the package, and you decide that you're going to put it aside until a bomb- sniffing dog can come over and render its opinion on the matter. %$* 556
congratulations, you just engaged in profiling. %$* 556
now, obviously, packages are not people. %$* 556
fed ex boxes have neither civil rights nor emotions. %$* 556
people do and we always must be aware of and sensitive to that. %$* 556
however, in a world of limited time, personnel, and money, we have no choice but to focus on those people who threaten to destroy aircraft and the flying public who ride within them. %$* 556
and that is why my team and i urge you to vote in favor of tonight's resolution, "u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling." let me emphasize that we do not advocate letting airport security personnel cater to their own personal ethnic or ecclesiastical biases. %$* 556
instead, we want the tsa and others to recognize that the current threat to passengers and airliners comes almost exclusively from one source, and we all know what it is, young males between about 18 and 35 who practice a fundamentalist strain of the islamic faith, and generally hail from the middle east, as well as largely muslim nations in africa and south asia. %$* 556
there are exceptions to this profile, but they're quite rare indeed. %$* 556
we learned about this profile on september 11 when all the hijackers who attacked us that day fit the parameters that i've identified. %$* 556
had the security personnel at newark, dulles, or boston-logan airports profiled these hijackers, they might have been stopped and nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11 would be with us here today. %$* 556
in a few minutes you will hear from my colleague, asra nomani. %$* 556
she will demonstrate that this profile did not begin on september 11 and it did not end then either. %$* 556
my colleague, bob baer, a former intelligence officer, will explain that what we advocate is a response to intelligence. %$* 556
he also will show that preventing terror at and through america's airports involves responding to the evolving threat profile that faces us at any given time. %$* 556
now, mind you, we are not arguing that the tsa should send anyone named mohammed to be water boarded somewhere between the first class lounge and the pizza hut. %$* 556
however, if you are a male between about 18 and 35 and are traveling on a middle eastern passport or one from a predominantly muslim country, it might be smart to ask you a few extra questions, carefully peruse your papers, and if things seem unusual we perhaps should take a closer look at your luggage. %$* 556
this really is not religious or racial profiling so much as it is terrorist profiling. %$* 556
we want to increase, not decrease, the probability that our security personnel will stop terrorists before they can board passenger jets, and once again turn them into bombs and missiles. %$* 556
this differs little from what police departments do today to deploy their limited resources in order to raise the odds of successfully reducing crime. %$* 556
if the nypd were seeking a mafia hit man who just flew in from naples to whack somebody, i doubt the nypd would dispatch squad cars to 125th street and malcolm x boulevard. %$* 556
if you set up a sobriety checkpoint, if you’re a police department, you most likely would put it somewhere near bars, not close to churches. %$* 556
similarly, if a wave of bank robberies were committed by a black man between ages 45 and 50, and if he were just under six feet tall, and lived in manhattan’s east village, i would not be shocked if the police stopped me and asked me a few questions. %$* 556
why? %$* 556
i perfectly fit that profile. %$* 556
now, would that leave me thrilled and delighted? %$* 556
probably not, but i would know that these law enforcement officers were doing their jobs, and that, i would understand. %$* 556
does my team advocate violating people’s rights? %$* 556
absolutely not. %$* 556
remember, among the rights that officials need to protect is the right to fly on a plane and assume that it will land at your destination with you and your fellow passengers alive and well at your destination. %$* 556
that right deserves maximum attention from those who we pay to keep us safe from those who want us dead. %$* 556
our opponents might say that the profile we've identified would miss someone like timothy mcveigh, the non-muslim man who blew up the federal building in oklahoma city. %$* 556
however, to look more carefully at someone does not mean that you ignore everyone else. %$* 556
this resolution is not an either/or proposition. %$* 556
terrorist profiling can exist with wisely applied traditional screening measures for other passengers. %$* 556
finally, what if we avoid terrorist profiling? %$* 556
at best, we will keep wasting scarce resources by subjecting everyone to the same time consuming often humiliating searches that have generated such public outrage recently. %$* 556
the tsa can keep checking the prosthetic breasts of american women who have endured mastectomies as happened a few months ago to cathy bossi, a 32-year veteran airline employee. %$* 556
at worst, tsa officers might come face-to-face with a bomb-wielding passenger who fits the terrorist profile but then breezed him through security because they don’t want to make him uncomfortable. %$* 556
the result could be a deadly airborne attack that we all have feared since september 11.my team wants to prevent this from happening and we hope you do, too. %$* 556
please join us in supporting tonight’s resolution, “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” thank you very much. %$* 556
thank you, deroy murdock. %$* 13
well you’ve just heard the motion restated, “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and now heading to her lectern to argue against this motion, debra burlingame who is actually a career flight attendant and you went to law school and you practiced law. %$* 13
on september 11, your brother took off at the controls of flight 77 before the hijacking. %$* 13
he died in the crash into the pentagon. %$* 13
i want to ask you now that you’re no longer practicing law and you’ve left the airline business, what would you say is-- %$* 13
how do you define yourself, your role? %$* 13
well i started off just trying to find out what happened to my brother that day and it evolved into essentially becoming a political activist. %$* 557
but i would just basically say i’m a troublemaker and i hope to cause some troubles for those guys over there tonight. %$* 557
ladies and gentlemen, let’s see how you do, debra burlingame. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 557
thank you. %$* 557
i stand in opposition to the resolution that u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling and i do so not only as the sister of someone who died at the hands of terrorists in the cockpit of his commercial airliner but also as someone who worked in that industry for many years. %$* 557
i did so in the late 1970s into the 80s at a time when aviation became the obsessive focus of international terrorists and trans-national terrorist organizations. %$* 557
it is different now. %$* 557
it has evolved and it has gotten a lot more complicated. %$* 557
the environment up there is basically the same. %$* 557
the reason for my opposition is simple. %$* 557
it simply doesn’t work. %$* 557
it results in a waste of time and resources. %$* 557
it is counterproductive and by that i mean it causes more harm than any good, any putative good. %$* 557
for those of you sitting in this audience who are neither arab looking nor south asian looking, i ask you to contemplate, think back the last time you were at the airport if you were ever pulled out of line when you didn’t expect it and you hadn’t said or done anything wrong and maybe even treated a little peremptory way because the airport recently maybe an unexpected engagement that was quite unwanted and maybe even by your definition quite humiliating. %$* 557
i ask you, for those of you who have been through that who are not arab looking or south asian looking or muslim looking, i ask you to consider what it would be like to experience that every time you go to the airport on every time you fly. %$* 557
it would appear to you, it would feel not like a security measure but a grave injustice because you would be singled out, not for anything you said or did, as i said, you would be singled out simply for the level of melatonin in your skin. %$* 557
and make no mistake, the tsos who are doing this will not know what country you are from. %$* 557
in fact u.s.travel documents don’t indicate that. %$* 557
maybe perhaps if you’re showing your id where you were born. %$* 557
but basically when they’re picking you out of the line, all they’re going by is how you appear. %$* 557
now i frankly don’t know how u.s.airports would profile on religion because religion is something that’s in your heart or on your head. %$* 557
and i believe that there would be a legal challenge if this question were asked at the airport or if it were somehow required to be in your travel documents or your id.i think it would fail the constitutional challenge. %$* 557
so what are they going by? %$* 557
they’re going to be going by, what, head scarves. %$* 557
i will only bring you to the example of the airport security video that was published. %$* 557
you can see it on youtube of the hijackers on my brother's plane going through dulles. %$* 557
they look like your typical american people. %$* 557
they're wearing dress shirts and chinos. %$* 557
and there is nothing in that video that would suggest to you that they are a terrorist or that they are muslim or that they hate infidels and want to kill them. %$* 557
not a thing. %$* 557
and i thank you, deroy. %$* 557
they would thank you, future terrorists, for giving them a blueprint in your description of what not to look like the next time they come to the airport. %$* 557
thank you. %$* 557
i hope i pick up some votes there. %$* 557
i'm in favor of behavioral profiling. %$* 557
and i believe that does work. %$* 557
i think we should stop focusing on things. %$* 557
yes, packages aren’t people. %$* 557
we should focus on behavior because the moment we profile on status, the enemy will seize on it and go in a different direction. %$* 557
i'm going to give you-- %$* 557
try to give you three examples very quick on how behavioral profiling has been very successfully used. %$* 557
there are lots and lots of examples. %$* 557
but here are three that i think are pretty good. %$* 557
i'm going to try and make it under the limit. %$* 557
a guy by the name of benni norris, aka, ahmed ressam. %$* 557
he was the millennium bomber. %$* 557
he rented a car to get from canada on the car ferry over into port angeles, washington. %$* 557
at the state of washington, a very astute customs agent saw him. %$* 557
he had filled out his customs forms incorrectly, so he was singled out, tapped for secondary screening. %$* 557
her colleague says, “oh, diana, we want to go home. %$* 557
it's christmas time. %$* 557
it's the last car, the last ferry, let it go.” she said, “no, there's something wrong about this guy.” and here is what was wrong. %$* 557
he was sweating profusely in cold, freezing weather in december. %$* 557
she asked him some questions. %$* 557
that went badly. %$* 557
she asked him to open up his trunk. %$* 557
bingo, explosives, det cords, a map of lax. he was done. %$* 557
mohammad al-qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker who came in through orlando airport, a saudi national who was, again, brought-- %$* 557
tapped for secondary screening. %$* 557
the inspector asked him questions. %$* 557
his answers were all wrong. %$* 557
he had $2,800 in cash, one way ticket, no return ticket, no hotel, no credit cards, no visible means of managing in six days of vacation travel on 2800 bucks alone. %$* 557
it went downhill from there. %$* 557
but he got turned around. %$* 557
basically he was given the choice of leaving or going through court proceedings. %$* 557
he left. %$* 557
the next time we saw him was at tora bora, the battle of tora bora. %$* 557
he ended up at guantanamo. %$* 557
and the final one i'll give you-- %$* 557
and again, there are many, many more-- %$* 557
that's zacarias moussaoui. %$* 557
he presented himself as a businessman, moroccan born, french accent, businessman from france who wanted to buy simulator time on a boeing 747 400, the biggest passenger plane in the sky. %$* 557
but he didn't make sense. %$* 557
and two very astute flight instructors-- %$* 557
i like to say their names because they're heroes. %$* 557
hugh sims and tim nelson, they thought it was awfully weird that a businessman would be paying for his sim time in a plane that he didn't have any understanding of with 68 100-dollar bills. %$* 557
they pressed their employer to call the fbi, and the rest is history. %$* 557
i could go on and on about the morality or the immorality of doing this. %$* 557
but i'll leave that to my teammates. %$* 557
please vote for us. %$* 557
thank you. %$* 557
thank you, debra burlingame. %$* 13
“u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” that is our motion. %$* 13
and now here to speak for the motion, asra nomani who is a former wall street journal reporter. %$* 13
she now works on a project investigating, still investigating the murder of daniel pearl who was her friend and long-time colleague. %$* 13
she is the only american muslim on the stage tonight. %$* 13
and i presume to say that you're in the position where you would or-- %$* 13
let me say male members of your family, very likely would be, in this time we live in, those who would be pulled off in line. %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
am i being too presumptuous on that, or do you think that's realistic. %$* 13
no, i mean, i was happy to take the train from dc today. %$* 472
all right. %$* 13
looking forward to hearing the rest of the argument. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, asra nomani. %$* 13
i want to first thank all of you for coming to talk about this really important discussion. %$* 472
we all know it's in the news. %$* 472
we know that it is something that matters to us personally. %$* 472
and i want to thank the panel from the other side and my own teammates for daring to talk about something that is so sensitive that oftentimes it is a taboo topic. %$* 472
and it especially is one inside of our muslim community. %$* 472
it is one that hurts us. %$* 472
it is one that causes me great pain to actually come and speak to you about. %$* 472
when i first got the invitation, the assumption was that i would be speaking against the motion. %$* 472
but after several years of pondering on this really difficult topic, i firmly believe that u.s.airports should profile based on religion and racial issues. %$* 472
i came to this country at the age of four in the summer of 1969 on a twa jet from bombay to john f.kennedy airport. %$* 472
ever since then, i have loved travel. %$* 472
i have loved the airline industry. %$* 472
i came from a very conservative muslim family. %$* 472
islam has been a part of my life. %$* 472
it's been a part of my being. %$* 472
but something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of our muslim community and inside of the airline industry. %$* 472
inside of our muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very real interpretation of islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civilian targets. %$* 472
this is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of our community. %$* 472
but it's a truth. %$* 472
and i want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recent years. %$* 472
and inside of the airline industry, we have seen pan am leave us. %$* 472
we have seen twa die off. %$* 472
the airline industry is also under great pressure. %$* 472
airplane crashes, airline security issues have serious consequences, not just on the traveling public but on this really important industry. %$* 472
.and this issue of profiling has been the taboo topic in the midst of all of this conversation. %$* 472
i do come from a muslim family. %$* 472
i am brown, for radio audience members who can't see me. %$* 472
my father has mohammed in his name. %$* 472
he's 80-some years old, but he gets pulled at the security checkpoint. %$* 472
and still i stand before you and i say, profile me. %$* 472
profile my family. %$* 472
profile my father because inside of our muslim community, i fundamentally believe that we have failed to police ourselves. %$* 472
we have failed our country here in america. %$* 472
we have failed our world. %$* 472
i express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to debra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of september 11.and i recognize that we as a nation, both in the u.s.and inside of our muslim communities, have largely not yet even healed. %$* 472
we are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists out there. %$* 472
and religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship with issues of violence. %$* 472
a wonderful study by the state university of new york at albany concluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology. %$* 472
when you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination. %$* 472
we saw that dangerous combination on september 11.it was the manifestation of an interpretation inside of our muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and on airliners. %$* 472
there was a fatwa issued by osama bin laden in 1998 when he had created the international islamic front for fighting the jews and crusaders. %$* 472
and he established very clearly in his marching orders, “bring down their aircraft. %$* 472
have the attack be one of violence that is pitiless.” he was very clear in what his objective was. %$* 472
and i have before me a koran that comes from the kingdom of saudi arabia. %$* 472
and i want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of our community, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want. %$* 472
and in it it says “guide us to the straight way.” it's a very simple message. %$* 472
but what the government of saudi arabia has done is added into here, “unlike the way of the jews and the christians.” and so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makes airports and airliners targets. %$* 472
and it's not just the stuff of rhetoric. %$* 472
bojinka, 1990s, plot by ramzi yousef and khalid shaikh mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from asia to the u.s.scotland, glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the los angeles airport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning had gone out to look out for men of middle eastern origin, and so the customs officials actually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at los angeles airport. %$* 472
and 2007, jfk airport, that airport where i arrived, there were young muslim men who said, "let us attack john f.kennedy international airport because any time you hit kennedy it is the most hurtful thing to the united states, to hit john f.kennedy, wow, they love john f.kennedy, like, he's the man. %$* 472
if you hit that, this whole country will be mourning. %$* 472
you can kill the man twice." this is the stuff of the operations and the actual attacks that are inside of our community. %$* 472
i'm not happy that this is happening inside of our community, but i tell you that we must be honest about it, and i urge you to vote for the motion that u.s.airports should use religious and racial profiling. %$* 472
thank you so much. %$* 472
thank you, asra nomni. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams of three, arguing over this motion, "u.s. airports should use racial and religious profiling." .3 %$* 13
you have heard the first three opening statements, and now on to the fourth. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce and welcome to his lectern hassan abbas, who is from-- %$* 13
comes from pakistan, has been living in the united states since the beginning of 2001.he was associated at that time with harvard. %$* 13
he's now at columbia. %$* 13
beginning of 2001 he was working on his master's. %$* 13
he now holds a ph.d. but in the interim, after the attacks on september 11, he wrote a book that made him very unpopular back in your home country because you said what? %$* 13
because i decided to declassify some of the stuff on my own, and had talked about the militant groups and their linkages with the state, and i criticized the darling of the west, pervez musharraf. %$* 558
and you were for a long time a member of the administration of pervez musharraf. %$* 13
i was part of the police service in pakistan. %$* 558
before you came. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, hassan abbas. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 558
first, it’s a great honor and privilege to be here today. %$* 558
i would like to right in the beginning just be very clear about the topic. %$* 558
and let’s exactly focus on what we are looking at. %$* 558
u.s.should profile based on racial and religious identity. %$* 558
this whole discussion and debate about liberty and security is not a new one. %$* 558
even the cabdriver who brought me here, because i was coming from colombia, it was about 40- minute drive so we started discussing the issue. %$* 558
he was from south asia. %$* 558
and when i was trying to explain him-- %$* 558
i was looking at my notes and trying to explain to him what this debate is about where he was taking me, he said-- %$* 558
he stopped me because he was listening to the npr the whole day, he said, "well, you are talking about these swedish grandma, swedish grandmas who have to be patted down." and i said, "no, this is not-- %$* 558
be focused-- %$* 558
." .2 %$* 558
the central issue i would argue is not about the different ways and mechanisms and the different strategies, that will be used in profiling, there are three fundamental issues, the first and the foremost is about whether it is legal and constitutional, secondly, what law enforcement tells you, what these different police organizations, there are so many people who are involved in the security sector, what is their general consensus, and the third, and i think a very important point, is what is the impact of this policy on the social fabric of society? %$* 558
first, very clearly, it is illegal and unlawful. %$* 558
why? %$* 558
when we are saying that a person of a certain religious identity, certain religious belief will be checked, how will you do that? %$* 558
you'll ask them-- %$* 558
as debra rightly pointed out, whether you'll ask them to bring their id cards, or you will ask, muslims within the united states about five million or so and all muslims from around the world to bring an id, whether they are muslim. %$* 558
so by that definition, and i’ll have to ask them to also to bring this id whether they’re christian, whether they’re jewish, whether they’re hindu. %$* 558
my argument is that is in principle a violation of the constitution. %$* 558
let’s leave even this argument on the side and let me move on to something which is more profound which is that this kind of religious profiling and racial profiling is not something which is an isolated thing at the airport. %$* 558
this is something which transcends, you start looking at that community in a way that is “okay these are the guys who are always stopped at the airport because they pose a certain threat.” it has an impact on the job opportunities for that community. %$* 558
it has an impact on their status in society. %$* 558
it has an impact on the kids. %$* 558
and i give you a few examples also about how perhaps later on, examples which tell you what the kids from these communities, muslim community here we are talking about, go through because then there is a threatened environment where you blame the whole community and to asra with all due respect. %$* 558
i am absolutely not ready to apologize for all the bigots and the narrow-minded people who conduct terrorism. %$* 558
i would argue, just look at the data bases. %$* 558
there’s a new study which is not mentioned, only in the academic circles, but was mentioned in 2010 on cnn.it tells you very clearly that the whole threat about extremism coming from the muslims is an exaggerated thing. %$* 558
look at the latest rand study, it’s a major think tank, it’s not some small research institute in some corner. %$* 558
it’s a major think-tank getting funding from u.s.government also. %$* 558
rand corporation says the total number of terrorism incidences which involved radicals from the u.s. .6-- %$* 558
were 46.in some cases there was only one person involved, in other cases, about three people. %$* 558
it’s another matter how many of them were convicted. %$* 558
but just compare this data set which is on the fbi’s website. %$* 558
compare the total number of terrorist attacks within the united states from 1970 to 2009.it is so very clear. %$* 558
the number of terrorist attacks, for example, those that were happening in 1970’s where much more lethal, from much more diverse communities. %$* 558
so the larger argument i am making is we need smarter strategies. %$* 558
we need strategies which will be able to utilize with limited resources. %$* 558
another issue, related to this is, this often is a cover-up, a cover-up for bureaucratic incompetence and their failures. %$* 558
it’s very easy for them to say because we our intelligence has failed because of all the different ways we could have profiled those terrorists have failed, if you cannot distinguish between a pakistani taliban or an afghan taliban and so many other groups. %$* 558
the tendency is to just call all of them al qaeda, on one side, just call-- %$* 558
on the other side are people who are taliban. %$* 558
it is very important to note how many of these groups are posing a terror threat to the united states. %$* 558
i’m not interested in the total number of terrorist attacks all over the world. %$* 558
the suicide bombers in sri lanka or what’s happening with the islamic movement in uzbekistan in central asia or the suicide attacks in pakistan for that matter. %$* 558
i am as a pakistani-american interested in those people who are attacking or who are posing a direct threat to the united states. %$* 558
look at the data set in the last nine years and it will make it very obvious. %$* 558
one last personal anecdote and there are many other arguments about the legality of the whole issue that i’ll come to later, i would even argue that racial and religious profiling is already taking place. %$* 558
just a brief anecdote. %$* 558
i have hardly a minute or so to tell you. %$* 558
i am an academic. %$* 558
i teach at columbia, previously at harvard as was mentioned. %$* 558
about six, seven months ago i was invited to go and give a lecture to the nato officers in germany who were about to be deployed to afghanistan. %$* 558
and on the way back and by the way the last 10 years despite all my academic work and my work about militants, i always am screened and that’s fine. %$* 558
as a former law enforcement officer, here i agree i’m absolutely fine with that. %$* 558
but if i am stopped every time. %$* 558
the last time the question i was asked “so what were you teaching.” i said “about terrorism.” they said “really? %$* 558
so did the nato officers pay you? %$* 558
” i said yes. %$* 558
“whether that cash is in your bag? %$* 558
” i said “no, that cash is not in my bag.” but i was stunned. %$* 558
i would like to tell you and i am about to be done with my time, my question is i’m fine when i’m profiled. %$* 558
but when i’m traveling with my family and every time my daughters ask me, after four hours of waiting that “baba, dad, are you a criminal? %$* 558
have you committed some terrorist attack? %$* 558
” i would like to-- %$* 558
hassan abbas, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and here to argue for the motion, robert baer, a former cia agent making his way to the lecturn. %$* 13
bob there is the cia guy journalists love to interview because he really did it in the late '70s, through the '80s into the '90s. %$* 13
he really was a spy in the middle east and wore disguises and jumped out of airplanes. %$* 13
and then he wrote a terrific book about it, a little bit naughty because he told a lot of secrets. %$* 13
it was turned into the inspiration for a movie called “syriana.” and bob, apparently you inspired the george clooney role. %$* 13
did you see the resemblance all along? %$* 13
i guess so. %$* 559
i was starting to get thick around the middle, yes. %$* 559
it's true. %$* 559
ladies and gentlemen, robert baer. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 559
you know, all these arguments are telling. %$* 559
but i'm going to approach profiling from-- %$* 559
first i'd like to say that i have a daughter from pakistan. %$* 559
and i have a lot of pakistani visas. %$* 559
and she's from faisalabad, it's from a center of terror, a lot of terrorists have come there. %$* 559
and i would fit that profile as well. %$* 559
and i'll say it now. %$* 559
i don't mind being stopped. %$* 559
and i have been stopped. %$* 559
but we have-- %$* 559
you have to look at this-- %$* 559
what i think is a mistake is if we let this devolve, this argument, into islam against the west or the united states against the west. %$* 559
let me take an example. %$* 559
it may seem a bit facetious, but it's a very real one. %$* 559
the secret service has a source inside the aryan brotherhood. %$* 559
a source says there's going to be an attempt on a black american president. %$* 559
it's going to take place inside washington, d.c.and that's all the details i have. %$* 559
maybe it's going to be a rocket. %$* 559
maybe it's going to be a service to air missile that can hit a helicopter. %$* 559
the d.c.police are informed, the fbi, homeland security. %$* 559
and all we know at this point is it's probably going to take place in a week. %$* 559
what does the secret service do the fbi.they do triage. %$* 559
they are going to be looking for white males with tattoos, short haircuts, frequenting certain places of a certain economic stature. %$* 559
those people are going to be profiled. %$* 559
so i think it's important to get away from this is a crusade against islam because that's not what it is. %$* 559
let's take the israelis. %$* 559
whatever side you come down on that, they have a certain experience in the middle east. %$* 559
call it profiling, call it what you will. %$* 559
i was in lebanon in the '80s. %$* 559
and their assumption when they invaded in 1982 is they were going to have a problem with palestinian muslims. %$* 559
by 1987, the problem was not with palestinian muslims. %$* 559
it was with christian women. %$* 559
first suicide bombers were christian and women. %$* 559
their profile went from religion to a fairly light maronite and orthodox christians. %$* 559
the whole idea of profiling has to do with triage. %$* 559
if you're tsa or the fbi or the cia, you have a limited amount of time, and you have to understand the background and the religion of people. %$* 559
let's take iran today. %$* 559
everybody calls it a terrorist state. %$* 559
but give me one example when an iranian has committed suicide either on a plane or a car bomb or anywhere else. %$* 559
they just don't do it. %$* 559
look at the history going back to 1980.yes, they did on the front. %$* 559
but they were never involved in terrorism. %$* 559
if i am the tsa supervisor, and you have a plane and a threat, and you can only check a certain amount of people, i would write off the iranians first of all. %$* 559
within islam, there is profiling in saudi arabia. %$* 559
they can pinpoint the cities, the villages and the school of islam that is likely to commit suicide bombings. %$* 559
when's the last time there's been a bombing on a saudi airline? %$* 559
hasn't been one. %$* 559
they know who's getting on. %$* 559
and they can identify the religious school which happens to be hanafi, that has a proclivity for this. %$* 559
yes, they profile. %$* 559
but at the end of the day, we-- %$* 559
the problem is we are a liberal society. %$* 559
our intelligence, having served 21 years in the cia and having tried and failed many times, is not good. %$* 559
we are not the israelis. %$* 559
the israelis know every single palestinian, who gets on, who's safe, who needs to be searched, who doesn't. %$* 559
scanners don't do it. %$* 559
you can take petn and you can insert it in a cavity, and the chances of a scanner picking this up are remote. %$* 559
behavior, look at the 9/11 bombers. %$* 559
they went to bars the night before. %$* 559
they were drinking. %$* 559
if the fbi had been after them, they wouldn't have fit a profile for-- %$* 559
nothing in their behavior before-- %$* 559
they didn't go to the mosque. %$* 559
they didn't do any preaching, anything like that. %$* 559
and once they got on the airplane, i have seen the film. %$* 559
they looked pretty normal to me. %$* 559
but had tsa been around, and had they looked at this, they could have figured out where those-- %$* 559
the muscle 15 came from in saudi arabia, and say, yes, that school of islam had a proclivity for doing suicide bombings. %$* 559
another thing, we go back to triage and why this profiling is in a sense repulsive because it is based on a certain amount of racism. %$* 559
let's face it. %$* 559
but there isn't a choice. %$* 559
and because the triage changes from day to day, you look at the tamils, there's still a war going on. %$* 559
if you're at jfk, and you get a threat to air india, it's going to be a suicide bomber, and air india and tsa have to go through triage. %$* 559
they are going to be looking at people who are darker, because the tamils are. %$* 559
they're hindus. %$* 559
they have certain names. %$* 559
and in no way is this-- %$* 559
you are selecting them out for a secondary search. %$* 559
this will happen in almost any good airport in the world. %$* 559
i just came back from sydney. %$* 559
they stopped me. %$* 559
they wanted to know who i was. %$* 559
i'm white, middle class. %$* 559
don't look like a suicide bomber. %$* 559
but they did a credit check at the airport, pulled me aside because i was an american. %$* 559
i realize it doesn’t have anything to do with religion, but they profiled me. %$* 559
they established who i was. %$* 559
i was let on that airplane. %$* 559
so this is why i urge that as difficult a decision it is, that we have to profile to help our intelligence services. %$* 559
and there isn't a choice. %$* 559
thank you, bob baer. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and speaking finally against the motion, i'd like to introduce michael chertoff. %$* 13
when september 11 happened, and the u.s.responded by creating the department of homeland security, he was its first secretary. %$* 13
and i want to ask michael, at that time, was there an internal debate about making profiling policy? %$* 13
actually, john, i was the second secretary from the time of 9/11.i was the head of the criminal division of the department of justice. %$* 306
and it was my responsibility to track the hijackers and be part of the first efforts to prevent this from happening again. %$* 306
and, of course, i carried that on when i was secretary of homeland security, where my top priority, frankly, was making sure it didn't happen again. %$* 306
and i am pleased that it didn't, and it hasn't yet. %$* 306
but it's a constant struggle. %$* 306
my correction, it was tom ridge. %$* 13
but i get back to the question. %$* 13
was there-- %$* 13
the answer is-- %$* 306
was there a debate? %$* 13
there was a debate. %$* 306
and we sat at various times with the professionals, people with lots of experience at border protection and aviation protection and the fbi. .6 %$* 306
and there was a unanimous belief that racial and religious profiling would be not only ineffective, but counterproductive from a security standpoint. %$* 306
all right. %$* 13
let's hear your argument. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael chertoff. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 306
i want to praise my adversaries because they've done on eloquent job of arguing for a different proposition than the one you were asked to vote on a few moments ago. %$* 306
the proposition here is, do we engage in racial or religious profiling? %$* 306
and the answer to that, i submit, is no. %$* 306
the proposition they argued for is do we engage in behavioral profiling. %$* 306
do we look at characteristics of people's behavior, where they went to school, where they traveled, things that they might have done, people they might have known. %$* 306
and do we use that as part of the basis for determining whether we need to take a closer look at them. %$* 306
and i think the answer to that is yes. %$* 306
that's good law enforcement. %$* 306
it's good intelligence. %$* 306
but it's not based on race or religion. %$* 306
it's based upon things that people do, places they go, schooling they've had, people they associate with, people they communicate with, people who buy their tickets. %$* 306
you know, robert baer talked about the 9/11 hijackers not being susceptible to behavioral profiling. %$* 306
i had the responsibility for investigating that and for authorizing the prosecution of moussaoui, and i can tell you, had we in fact examined their behavior going back over a period of time, we would have seen the connections to radicals and extremists that would have tipped us off, that we should have taken a closer look. %$* 306
that's a great argument for behavioral profiling, it's a lousy argument for racial or religious profiling. %$* 306
you know, deroy talked about the class of people that he thinks we ought to be looking at, what race and what religion, and the problem is that it's the wrong set of principles to apply here. %$* 306
what is the race we ought to look at? %$* 306
he said, "well, we ought to look at people who are arabs or people from muslim countries." .7 %$* 306
well, does that mean indians, for example, most of whom were hindu, some of whom were buddhists? %$* 306
does it mean people of asian descent who live in south africa? %$* 306
what about africans and african-americans? %$* 306
abdulmutallab came from nigeria. %$* 306
does that mean deroy ought to be pulled aside because he's an african-american? %$* 306
the sad reality is that there is no single group, ethnicity or a group signified by its appearance, that you can identify by looking at them in a way that will tell you that they are an extremist or not an extremist. %$* 306
let's talk about some of the more notable terrorists that have been apprehended in the last nine years. %$* 306
there's jose padilla, not from south asia, a converted muslim, came from chicago. %$* 306
there's bryant neal vinas, came from long island, his parents were catholic, he converted, he went to pakistan, he trained, he came back to try to blow up subways. %$* 306
daniel maldonado went to somalia. %$* 306
he was born in new hampshire, again, catholic parents, converted. %$* 306

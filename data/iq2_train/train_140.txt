this was a facebook revolution, youtube revolution, twitter. %$* 412
it was about communications on the ground. %$* 412
the islamists then hijacked the revolution. %$* 412
and now you want to hand it over to them as if there're no liberals on the ground. %$* 412
and i think it's insulting to the middle east population to say that there're no liberals-- %$* 412
that there're no liberals on the ground. %$* 412
i've read hundreds of those leaders and scholars. %$* 412
but they've just either been in jail or suppressed by both of the ones you want us to believe. %$* 412
brian katulis. %$* 13
well, i think the notion that we could work with dictators today in 2012 and pressure them and things like this, it's quaint to me. %$* 411
it sounds like the cold war. %$* 411
it sounds like a 20th century idea that worked back then but doesn't understand statecraft as it is today, doesn't understand power as it is today. %$* 411
and i think we see this on full display with our colleagues here who are debating against this motion. %$* 411
zuhdi equated fighting against theocracy with fighting against elected islamists. %$* 411
and iâ€™ve got to tell you, there's a big gap between those two. %$* 411
and i also got to tell you that i think when i listen to them present their arguments, not only do they think that the people of the middle east are foolish and will just listen to elected islamists and reelect them blindly, i think they think you're foolish tonight because i think the biggest argument that could be made is-- %$* 411
and it's not about the leaders or what morsi says and what he might not say-- %$* 411
when i see egypt today, egypt after mubarak is an egypt where there're multiple centers of power that are competing for this. %$* 411
and they're fighting with each other. %$* 411
and, yes, islamists did well in the first round of elections. %$* 411
but guess what? %$* 411
i actually think in the next round of elections you're going to see even more competitive space here. %$* 411
you stick with dictatorships, you don't let islamists go out there and make fools of themselves in the way that i think elected democracies open up that space-- %$* 411
all right. %$* 13
then we're going to have the same old, same old. %$* 411
daniel pipes. %$* 13
you see an egypt that's got lots of contending centers of power. %$* 413
i see an egypt where the coptic population is increasingly being repressed, murdered, emigrating as it never has before. %$* 413
i see a population where women are being repressed as they never have been before. %$* 413
i see a country where the sharia, a medieval law code, is being dredged out and applied. %$* 413
and you call us "quaint"? %$* 413
you're advocating for a medieval code. %$* 413
can i-- %$* 411
let me let marc address that. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, one, the sharia has been the rule of law for much of the egyptian population all over the place for decades now. %$* 410
wait, can you-- %$* 13
one sentence, on what do you mean by that. %$* 13
in the sense that the central governing structure had collapsed. %$* 410
it wasn't there. %$* 410
i mean, one reason the islamic fundamentalists were to come-- %$* 410
able to come in and have such growth is because the social order from the central government, it just basically ceased to exist and also because there are a lot of egyptians out there who don't have a problem with much of the holy law. %$* 410
and i don't think you get to take the holy law, as tried-- %$* 410
as you tried to do in other places in the middle east, and just suddenly throw it-- %$* 410
ben ali tried to do it, just take it, throw it away-- %$* 410
you have to have it organically evolve. %$* 410
there is no other way, and i think you will. %$* 410
i mean, you suggest with mubarak that you could have nudged him. %$* 410
but every time we tried to nudge mubarak-- %$* 410
and the american government did try to nudge mubarak-- %$* 410
he would say, "if not me, then the islamists." %$* 410
so, reuel-- %$* 412
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
the way to make that organically evolve is not for the united states to side with the islamists. %$* 412
the way to make it evolve is to side with the liberals that want democratic change that speak out against theocracy. %$* 412
i mean, actually, i think what you've all been ignoring from-- %$* 412
if you're for the motion, what you're ignoring is the fact that the islamists you want us to support are byproducts of these dictators. %$* 412
the fact that mubarak housed the brotherhood, al azhar university flourished under him, the wahabis flourished under the monarchy of saudi arabia, hamas had headquarters under assad and syria. %$* 412
so to say that somehow these people just sort of accidentally got along pretty well with dictators until their revolutions happened, and now that the islamists found a way in, they're finally turning over the dictators that used to feed them for so long. %$* 412
in fact, it's the third path. %$* 412
if you really want liberal democrats to rise, you can't as the most powerful country-- %$* 412
let me ask this side, something that zuhdi just said, he said that these islamists, that you want us to support. %$* 13
is that accurate? %$* 13
you want us to support islamists? %$* 13
it's absolutely incorrect. %$* 411
we're not saying vote for these islamists. %$* 411
we're saying, "vote for the possibility of competition in these politics." and that's an oversimplification right there. %$* 411
and i think it's an oversimplification to say that this current u.s.administration supported islamists over any other thing. %$* 411
they've supported the openness and people having a voice in their own debates. %$* 411
is there a distinction-- %$* 13
let me go to this side-- %$* 13
if people will vote for islamists, is that the will of the people being expressed? %$* 13
i don't believe so. %$* 412
you can't know what the will is. %$* 412
sayid ibrahim said in the wall street journal-- %$* 412
he said, "please give us four or five years until we have elections because the liberals need time to get infrastructure, to get institutions, and the people that would get legs now are only more of the old. %$* 412
and the islamists came out of mubarak and all the dictators before-- %$* 412
make a quick response to that. %$* 410
my old friend and teacher, olivier roy, made the-- %$* 410
i thought the pithy remark where he said, "if france had to wait for the development of a democratic culture, france would still be a monarchy." the notion that you are somehow going to push off into the distance four or five years, and you get to four or five years, another four or five years, that you're going to have suddenly liberals become strong and the dominant party i think isn't serious. %$* 410
daniel pipes. %$* 13
ayman nour couldn't win an election in egypt right now if the cia had paid every single egyptian $5,000. %$* 410
daniel pipes. %$* 13
it wouldn't have happened. %$* 411
i find it curious that zuhdi and i are celebrating-- %$* 413
let's call them the liberals, the moderns, in egypt and the rest of the middle east, and you two are denigrating them and ignoring them. %$* 413
these are the hope. %$* 413
why don't you put your faith in them? %$* 413
'why do you put your faith in people who have a code and a vision that is as antithetical to ours as could-- %$* 413
i don't think-- %$* 13
let me just-- %$* 13
let me just clarify something. %$* 13
i don't think i hear them saying-- %$* 13
that's why i asked the question before, that they're putting their faith in the islamists, but that they're putting their faith in the openness of the process, which is different. %$* 13
brian just said that when the islamists come to power, they moderate, to which i would say, "yeah? %$* 413
tell me about iran." where's the moderation in iran? %$* 413
i see no moderation. %$* 413
i see, in fact, a more vicious government-- %$* 413
well, iran came to power through a revolution. %$* 410
it was a revolution against the shah. %$* 410
i mean, it was a complete, total overthrow, in fact, within a very short-- %$* 410
the thing that you would want to ask in iran is, have the individuals who initially supported khomeini, who supported the idea of theocracy, had an enormous change? %$* 410
you have. %$* 410
you can't find a halfway intelligent cleric who actually supports the idea of-- %$* 410
that's very nice, reuel. %$* 413
but, in fact, we have a government headed by one of khomeini's lieutenants, namely khamenei, who has a government that-- %$* 413
i think you'd agree with me-- %$* 413
is at least as vicious as khomeini's. %$* 413
where is the moderation? %$* 413
where have these people improved? %$* 413
no, but they didn't-- %$* 410
they haven't arrived. %$* 410
they have stopped elections. %$* 410
the evolution would have been in 1997 and 2009.each and every time, they've stopped it. %$* 410
now, if-- %$* 410
daniel, let him finish. %$* 13
daniel, let him finish. %$* 13
if, in the future-- %$* 410
we have to get there first. %$* 410
what you're doing is closing down the option. %$* 410
you're basically saying, "you don't get to have the right to have a democratic process." and by the way, the western democratic process, if you recall, was not terribly pretty. %$* 410
it was really ugly, took a long time. %$* 410
they'll have to go a really long distance before they actually have as bad a time as we did. %$* 410
all right. %$* 13
daniel pipes. %$* 13
i would like to point out that brian argued that the nonviolent islamists are the antidote to the violent islamists, that al-qaida had not much of a role, had no role in egypt and tunisia. %$* 413
well, what about syria? %$* 413
i believe al-qaida has a role there. %$* 413
and if not al-qaida itself, al- qaida types. %$* 413
what we see in syria is the bringing in of violent islamism, and-- %$* 413
which is the result of a dictatorship. %$* 411
if i take your formula-- %$* 411
and i respect your formula. %$* 411
i don't agree with it. %$* 411
but if i take your formula, zuhdi and daniel, you got to rely on the goodwill of bashar al-assad to sit down with secular liberals and give up power and actually open up the political system. %$* 411
that's your formula right now. %$* 411
you've been relying on that for years. %$* 411
i'm going to rely on the goodwill-- %$* 412
and the al-qaida elements which i'm worried about in syria, in the opposition, are the product of decades of that dictatorship that you're arguing for tonight. %$* 411
all right. %$* 13
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
i'll tell you the reality-- %$* 412
i'll tell you the reality of this motion. %$* 412
the reality, brian, is, in this motion, for example, in syria, you had the snc, the syrian national council that was really a conglomeration of expatriate islamist that got together. %$* 412
and the question is, this is relevant to america, because do we tip towards those islamists or do we tell the syrians on the ground, who were a majority non-islamist a year ago, that they will get the backing of america and the west, true defenders of freedom that will not push their oppressors, the new oppressors instead of the old oppressors. %$* 412
and that's what islamists are. %$* 412
and our opposition, i think, one of the things you're forgetting-- %$* 412
i've yet to hear from them one example of islamists that have moderated, whether it's the taliban or the wahabis in saudi arabia or the islamists in iran. %$* 412
every one of them seems to dig their heels in more and more. %$* 412
okay. %$* 13
here is their chance. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
brian katulis, go ahead, sir, brian. %$* 13
yeah, i started out my presentation talking about the vast majority of muslims living in south asia. %$* 411
indonesia, the number one largest muslim country in the world. %$* 411
prime examples of where islamists ran as political parties and they failed. %$* 411
they failed. %$* 411
and their populations actually voted them out. %$* 411
you have-- %$* 411
they are weakened, because they didn't deliver, and i think the central premise that you guys have is that elected islamists don't change or morph, or somehow don't become like other politicians. %$* 411
well, guess what-- %$* 411
they do, when you actually have open systems. %$* 411
we see this in turkey too. %$* 411
and i think there-- %$* 411
steps forward and steps backward on turkey's democracy, but by and large, turkey, i think, is a much more sustainable proposition than what daniel was talking about back in the cold war era, back in the 20th century. %$* 411
we're in the 21st century. %$* 411
okay, can-- %$* 13
we've got to deal with these realities. %$* 411
daniel, daniel, i-- %$* 13
jumping up and down here. %$* 413
all right, go ahead then. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
i have a question, but you go ahead. %$* 13
turkey, the first five years under erdogan and the akp was very careful because it was the military, and they didn't want to make any missteps. %$* 413
and now that they've gotten rid of the military, oh, they're going with guns blazing, and they're investigating, and they're enjailing, and they're indicting. %$* 413
and there are hundreds of people who have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy are put away for life. %$* 413
you name it. %$* 413
this is an increasingly authoritarian government. %$* 413
so i stick by our position which is that the islamists, when they get to power, whether in iran or turkey or egypt or tunisia, just get worse with time. %$* 413
and you mischaracterized our position. %$* 413
it's not that assad will be having negotiations with the liberals in syria. %$* 413
it's that we will be advocating for the liberals. %$* 413
we will be pushing assad. %$* 413
we have enormous power, implicit in this motion is u.s.policy. %$* 413
what do we want the united states government to do? %$* 413
and the worst thing we want the united states government to create space for the liberal, free minded modern people to enter in. %$* 413
and you're saying you want the u.s. government to invite the medieval types to come in. %$* 413
but does creating that free space-- %$* 13
does creating that free space continue on some level of support for dictatorship, to create space for the liberals? %$* 13
no. %$* 413
look, take mubarak. %$* 413
he was there for 30 years. %$* 413
no way do i want to help mubarak. %$* 413
i want to push mubarak. %$* 413
or take an actual government today. %$* 413
i want to push the algerians. %$* 413
i don't want to help the algerian government. %$* 413
i want to open up algeria. %$* 413
i want the liberals, the moderns in algeria to have more of a voice. %$* 413
that should be our role. %$* 413
that is the american role through history, is we are the advocates of democracy understood as liberal democracy around the world. %$* 413
let's do it in the middle east, not just in south america and africa and south asia and east asia. %$* 413
let's do it in the middle east too. %$* 413
reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
i think that's all great and fine, and we should support liberal democrats everywhere. %$* 410
i'm-- %$* 410
you know, i've been in favor of covert action programs all over the place. %$* 410
but i just don't see that you've got the traction. %$* 410
and i don't see if you go to mubarak-- %$* 410
mubarak made a real hobby out of squashing liberals like he made a hobby of squashing everybody else. %$* 410
and mubarak says, no, i don't want to do that. %$* 410
and what's the united states going to do? %$* 410
all right. %$* 410
take the money away. %$* 410
take the money from the military, and then he says, all right, you're going to weaken me. %$* 410
the islamists are coming. %$* 410
you've already said the islamists did come. %$* 410
so i don't think you can create liberals in the middle east out of sand. %$* 410
there has to be a process, an evolution. %$* 410
in the west, liberals were not born overnight. %$* 410
they came into being. %$* 410
it was-- %$* 410
i don't want to go through occidental history here. %$* 410
it was a very ugly process. %$* 410
what he is saying is that, no, you don't get to have that process. %$* 410
we had that process, but no, not you. %$* 410
muslims don't get to evolve. %$* 410
you have to be born liberals now. %$* 410
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
reuel, i'm sorry, you're living in this academic bubble that is so far removed from the reality on the ground that, you know, the reality on the ground is, as a muslim, the islamists never want debate, never allow debate. %$* 412
they suffocate liberal movements. %$* 412
and if you even look-- %$* 412
let's take turkey. %$* 412
the secretary general of the oic is turkish. %$* 412
give me one statement that man has made criticizing any other islamic regime, islamists from iran to the taliban, et cetera, to the saudis, the wahabis, not one, because together they seek a neocaliphate. %$* 412
they seek islamic hegemony around the world. %$* 412
and the islamists don't allow debate. %$* 412
i can tell you this from experience, and it's no better than the dictators. %$* 412
and actually, american influence, if we want to help the liberals, and if they see us saying, oh, well, the islamists are a little better, they're going to throw us aside and say, geez, there the americans go again caring not about us. %$* 412
zuhdi, daniel, your partner likened islamists to nazis. %$* 13
do you agree with that? %$* 13
and i want to bring that to the other side, nazis. %$* 13
they can't be reformed, and they're all the same. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
brian katulis. %$* 13
oh, absolutely not. %$* 411
i mean, especially elected islamists. %$* 411
and again, we're at the early stage of an experiment here in many of these countries. %$* 411
but just look at the facts. %$* 411
look at countries that are muslim majority. %$* 411
and again, i hate to bring up indonesia again. %$* 411
but bring that up again, and they change. %$* 411
they morph, they modify. %$* 411
i see it in egypt already. %$* 411
and again, we're in the early stages. %$* 411
it's hard to game this out. %$* 411
but you have different strands of islamism even within the muslim brotherhood, which we paint islamists. %$* 411
and this is sort of like a nice tactic people like to do is lump 1.6 billion muslims all together and talk about sort of political islam in some sort of way and make us believe that these people, the constituents, are fools and that they'll just blindly follow some sort of theology here. %$* 411
and you're saying not all islamists are the same. %$* 13
they're not at all, and modify-- %$* 411
i want to bring that point to the other side. %$* 13
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
i mean, john, the issue is, brian, indonesia was never islamist to prove your point. %$* 412
i mean, president wahid has been-- %$* 412
who is now passed away, but wrote a book called "the illusion of the islamic state," in which he, as a previous president, had the-- %$* 412
the bully pulpit of his presidency to fight against this islamism, the identity principles of islamic state, principles of sharia, et cetera. %$* 412
and still to this day, the islamist movement in indonesia is very potent, but they've never been in control. %$* 412
if they were in control, that might prove your thesis. %$* 412
but your thesis is that somehow we should allow them to tip towards islamism because that's the pathway to some type of better system. %$* 412
and they are nazis. %$* 412
why? %$* 412
because this is a supremacist idea. %$* 412
look at the-- %$* 412
what this country came out of. %$* 412
i think you're forgetting american history. %$* 412
our history was that christianity reformed and separated church and state, not through really a simple process. %$* 412
it was revolutionary with hundreds of thousands dying in europe for the enlightenment and then the american revolution. %$* 412
do you think that the islamic world is going to separate mosque and state in any less violent type of a revolution? %$* 412
it's going to be major. %$* 412
and the islamists aren't going to just sort of hand it over. %$* 412
reuel. %$* 13
i'm not sure i followed that at the end. %$* 410
there are islamists out there who are hell on earth. %$* 410
and i can't think of a single good islamist. %$* 410
it's impossible. %$* 410
that's really not the point. %$* 410
the point is how you bring about-- %$* 410
we rest our case. %$* 412
how do you bring about a political system where you have evolution, where you have some chance-- %$* 410
if you are going-- %$* 410
you're not going to get a situation-- %$* 410
and i think we've seen that since the arab-- %$* 410
great arab revolt started. %$* 410
you're not going to get a situation where liberals are going to win an election. %$* 410
people of faith are going to win the election. %$* 410
islamist parties are going to win the elections. %$* 410
so you're going to have to take that as a given. %$* 410
you're not going to be able to have the united states come in there and dictatorially essentially say-- %$* 410
i mean, kissinger made the great line, "democracy is great, but i really want to know who gets to win." you don't get to know who gets to win. %$* 410
you've got to go through the process. %$* 410
you have to set up a system where you have a jousting ethic. %$* 410
fundamentalists have to fight with fundamentalists. %$* 410
in egypt, the nour party of the salafis is absolutely morally repugnant, all right? %$* 410
no doubt about it. %$* 410
but they are actually in the process of collapse right now because they haven't figured out how to handle the pressure of democracy yet. %$* 410
the muslim brotherhood is having serious internal debates because they haven't figured out how to handle-- %$* 410
this is all new terrain for them. %$* 410
that's what we want. %$* 410
we want them to fight it out. %$* 410
it's not going to produce something pretty in the short term. %$* 410
but what they're suggesting, having dictatorship and somehow having the united states, oh, i'm going to create a liberal here and a liberal there and a liberal here, it makes no sense. %$* 410
all right. %$* 13
i want to let daniel pipes respond but in a-- %$* 13
but i just want to-- %$* 13
before i say that, after daniel's response, i'd like to go to questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
and the way that will work, if you raise your hand, and you catch my attention, and i can pretty much see everybody, i won't be able to take questions from upstairs. %$* 13
so if you want to ask one, you should come down. %$* 13
there will be people in the micro-- %$* 13
in the aisles with microphones. %$* 13
stand up, please. %$* 13
tell us who you are. %$* 13
and hold the microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth for the sake of the radio broadcast. %$* 13
i urge you to ask a question that is actually a question. %$* 13
i'll have to stop you if you're debating with the debaters. %$* 13
but i'm fine if you state a very, very short premise to your question. %$* 13
but when i say very short, i mean in 17 words or less. %$* 13
daniel pipes. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 413
i think what this difference boils down to is that our opponents do not apologize for islamists. %$* 413
you just heard it. %$* 413
i can't think of a single good islamist we just heard. %$* 413
and we sure don't apologize for dictators, assad, mubarak and the rest. %$* 413
so nobody likes anybody. %$* 413
the difference is you just saw reuel scornfully, "liberals, we're creating liberals. %$* 413
liberals, we're creating liberals."we think that this is the hope of the future. %$* 413
we think they do exist. %$* 413
we saw them. %$* 413
we saw them in tunisia and egypt and syria. %$* 413
we see them throughout the region. %$* 413
we believe they're the hope. %$* 413
and so we're trying to find a way to build them. %$* 413
they have given up on the liberals and are willing to go with the-- %$* 413
they're not happy about it, i gather, but they're quite ready to go with the medieval totalitarian order, medieval style totalitarian order. %$* 413
well, no thanks. %$* 413
let's be hopeful. %$* 413
let's try for a better middle east. %$* 413
let's work with the people who have a decent vision of the future. %$* 413
all right. %$* 13
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
my name's barbara arfa of the new york-- %$* 19
i'm sorry? %$* 13
barbara arfa-- %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
of new york city. %$* 19
i understand the premise of those of you who are speaking for the motion. %$* 19
and it's very enticing to believe that the islamists will morph. %$* 19
what i don't understand is how will they morph if there's so much violence that once they begin to change they are in tremendous danger of being killed by other islamists? %$* 19
there's so much murder, so much violence as part of that culture, aren't they afraid to morph? %$* 19
perfect question. %$* 13
this side. %$* 13
this side. %$* 13
brian katulis or reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
brian katulis. %$* 13
look, i think they have a greater possibility to morph now than if they were facing saddam hussein who killed hundreds of thousands of people, more possibility in places like tunisia to morph than they did in libya under muammar gaddafi, when you had organized mass murder. %$* 411
and let's be clear about this. %$* 411
i want to stress this. %$* 411
the transition in the middle east is in the very early stages, sorts of violence that we saw and we've been talking about, that killed our ambassador in libya, those extremists that killed him and murdered him, those sorts of things-- %$* 411
we need to recognize that those threats have not been completely eradicated. %$* 411
we also need to recognize that the large protests against those extremists in libya would never have actually happened under muammar gaddafi. %$* 411
we need to recognize that there's a space there, that i'm not in favor of elected islamists or liberals or anything. %$* 411
i'm in favor of systemic change that has legitimacy. %$* 411
and i think this is a key distinction between what reuel and i are saying and what the other team is saying. %$* 411
we can't implant this. %$* 411
we need to recognize the reality that because of the dysfunction caused by dictatorships for decades, you're going to have this first early result. %$* 411
and, yes, there's still going to be violence and risks, but i actually think it's less than what we saw in terms of the hundreds of thousands killed by the dictators in these countries. %$* 411
and i actually think the more that you have popular reaction of the sort that we saw in the streets of benghazi against those murderers, you have i think a possibility then to push them and further marginalize them in that debate. %$* 411
other side, do you want to respond? %$* 13
yes. %$* 412
i think-- %$* 412
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
i think, again, one of the core things that they're missing, and if you are for this motion you're missing the fact that islamism cannot be morphed. %$* 412
we have a muslim liberty project where we have youth that work with us from the young ages of 15 to 30, and we realized that we had to do it at a young age because once an islamist looks at the world through an islamic lens, that governments and everything should be looked at through islam and through cleric and through imams, not through reason, not through independence, not through the separation of mosque and state, and that their identity doesn't come from a national liberal identity but through a faith based islamic state, they are done. %$* 412
you can't reform them away from that. %$* 412
zuhdi, when-- %$* 13
and that's what we've got. %$* 412
when millions of people vote for an islamist party, what are they voting for? %$* 13
they're voting for a whim, they're voting for this sense that morality will come when corruption was before them. %$* 412
why did the-- %$* 412
some of the palestinian populations vote for the terrorist, hamas, when they had fatah? %$* 412
they saw fatah as corrupt. %$* 412
so this binary equation has created two evils that fed off of one another, and elections are not democracy. %$* 412
democracy is about principles of freedom and liberty, of representing the minority, and-- %$* 412
would you want to discourage an election if you felt that islamists were going to prevail in that election? %$* 13
no, no, i mean, and we fought communism without preventing the communist party from existing, et cetera, so i wouldn't want to outlaw. %$* 412
i think you can-- %$* 412
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
my question isn't really that. %$* 13
my question is are the paradox of these-- %$* 13
of encouraging a democratic election and then the election produces results that are anathema to you, do you go back a stage and wish that you hadn't had the democratic election? %$* 13
no. %$* 412
i think it should at least-- %$* 412
they shouldn't become our allies-- %$* 412
we should at least make a stance that just because they were elected doesn't mean that we have to share their vision or treat them any differently than we would a dictator. %$* 412
okay. %$* 13
another question. %$* 13
right down front. %$* 13
just wait for the mic, sir. %$* 13
it's on its way. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
and just-- %$* 13
i just want to give the camera a second to catch up with you. %$* 13
okay, go ahead. %$* 13
the name is russ, hi. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
pipes, you had said that part of the whole process and as, basically, u.s.involvement, that democracy is part of our job to spread. %$* 18
it's what we do. %$* 18
i'm kind of wondering why a 236-year-old system should be superimposed over thousands of years of a system that's already existed there and why it's our job to do that. %$* 18
it seems to me that we have always been able to effect change through the back door and not through the front door. %$* 18
by giving them popular culture, by giving them the things that we embrace as a country and that we love, you work through the youth of the countries that we're talking about-- %$* 18
can you wrap to a question on this? %$* 13
i think you do have a good one here. %$* 13
well, i guess the question really is, is the answer not necessarily to, you know, try to go through the front door and work on changing the leadership in those countries and getting them to change their minds, but rather in the up-and-coming youth of those countries by giving them all the things that have changed other countries, like russia and japan and-- %$* 18
you know, popular culture. %$* 18
daniel pipes. %$* 13
thank you, ross. %$* 413
i don't think american popular culture these days is particularly politically liberal or democratic. %$* 413
but i accept the basis of your point, which is that the united states is-- %$* 413
has unique instruments of influence, including its popular culture, beginning in the 1920s, which nobody else ever had before, and we have the most of, including its financial clout, including its military, its extraordinary range of tools. %$* 413
so here we are, as americans, saying, "well, how should we use these tools? %$* 413
" and our side is saying, let's use them with the goal of bringing to office people who think as we do, who believe in democracy, et cetera, liberal democracy. %$* 413
and this has been our career. %$* 413
woodrow wilson came up with the 14 points 100 years ago. %$* 413
and we had in japan and germany and austria and italy and other countries, we forcefully imposed it, and look, it worked. %$* 413
it can be imposed. %$* 413
in tiananmen square in 1989, they had a version of our statue of liberty as the representation of what they sought in freedom. %$* 413
we are-- %$* 413
the united states is the symbol of freedom, of liberty, of democracy. %$* 413
we are that. %$* 413
and it is something particularly noble about this country. %$* 413
let me take this to the other side. %$* 13
i'm enjoying daniel being the neocon. %$* 410
i'm enjoying this enormously. %$* 410
you know, the-- %$* 410
that's very snide. %$* 413
no, i agree with him. %$* 410
for me, that's a compliment. %$* 410
you know, i have to say this. %$* 410
it's not a question of imposition. %$* 410
i mean, what we're talking about here is, in fact, people in the middle east have absorbed, profoundly, western ideas. %$* 410
they haven't, by any means, absorbed them perfectly, ideally, to the level that we would like. %$* 410
but one of the things i'm arguing is, in fact, the idea of popular sovereignty has been absorbed through a wide body politic, including the faithful, including within those that we call islamic fundamentalists. %$* 410
if you can-- %$* 410
when i was in najaf in iraq and i was having discussions with one of the elder sons of grand ayatollah hakim, and we were discussing what democracy was, i mean, he understood to be, in his own conception, ma'ruf, that it something that was sacred, that popular sovereignty was sacred. %$* 410
now, in the next breath, he said, "i don't know where the red lines are." he had no idea where they are. %$* 410
we have red lines, too, in democracy, whether they be about abortion or other issues. %$* 410
we're not quite sure where certain issues in our ethics collide, where we don't want to compromise. %$* 410
they have, for the very first time, this problem. %$* 410
it is great that an elder son of one of the senior clerics in iraq has this problem. %$* 410
that's where you want to take this. %$* 410
and it's not a question of imposition. %$* 410
it's a question of they, themselves, taking the imports that they have voluntarily taken in and trying to figure out how they work out a more humane society. %$* 410
in their case, it's easy, given where they came from with saddam hussein, because they could screw up for a long time and it would still be more humane than what they had before. %$* 410
all right. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing this motion: "better elected islamists than dictators." right down in front, ma'am. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
dr. %$* 19
ahmed, the author of "in the land of invisible woman." i've lived in sharia law in saudi arabia, and i'm of pakistani heritage. %$* 19
so to my colleagues, i'd like you to say, "better elected islamists," comment on pakistan's 65-year history where it's advocated to be the world's first muslim democracy where there is no functioning democracy unless you are an islamist sympathizer. %$* 19
please comment on that. %$* 19
but-- %$* 19
and let me also add-- %$* 19
wait, wait, i'm-- %$* 13
let me add, as a muslim woman and someone who's lived and has friends and relatives in the middle east, i'm offended that you think there are no innate liberals. %$* 19
brian katulis. %$* 13
actually, i didn't say that there are no innate liberals. %$* 411
and i lived and worked for five years in the middle east. %$* 411
i go to pakistan frequently. %$* 411
i talk to them all of the time. %$* 411
they're fighting that struggle. %$* 411
and i'll tell you right now, pakistan's at an interesting moment that everybody's negative about pakistan and what's going on. %$* 411
there's an interesting dynamic that's been underplay there. %$* 411
and you've seen this. %$* 411
and i was there in 2009 when there was sufi mohammed, the head of pakistani taliban group, extremist group. %$* 411
he said that courts are un-islamic. %$* 411
he said that elections are un-islamic. %$* 411
and this was at a time, a territory called swat, about an hour outside of islamabad, was taken over by those very same extremists. %$* 411
and i was on the ground there. %$* 411
and the national outcry against sufi muhammad and the national protests against a video of a woman being beaten in that very same territory, the liberal and democratic response was there. %$* 411
and you saw it in the previous elections in 2008, the mma.you know it very well, an islamist party that said that they were going to ban cable television in northwest frontier pakistan. %$* 411
you know what? %$* 411
you know what a lot of men love watching wwe wrestling in pakistan. %$* 411
these parties tried to rule theocratically and by a basis of religious ideology, and they failed. %$* 411
they were voted out in the ballot in 2008.and as you know, not end of story, not end of story at all, because pakistan is at a dangerous place. %$* 411
but yes, there are liberals there. %$* 411
and they are fighting against those radical islamists. %$* 411
they are going to have an election. %$* 411
guess what? %$* 411
next year. %$* 411
and they are having an open debate. %$* 411

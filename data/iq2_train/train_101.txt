and now i would like to introduce the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., who makes all of this possible, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
welcome, and thank you all for coming. %$* 1
my task in these evenings is to frame the debate. %$* 1
and in this particular case i want to start by quoting george w.bush often proclaimed that “islam is a religion of peace” and it is one of the few things with which president obama agrees. %$* 1
it is doubtless true that the vast majority of muslims around the world live peacefully, and do not condone violent acts. %$* 1
their secular concerns are dominant—making a living, raising families, educating their children. %$* 1
their religion provides spiritual comfort, and a source of meaning, even transcendence, to their lives. %$* 1
on the other hand, just today the new york times reported that faisal shahzad, the times square bomber, said in court prior to sentencing “brace yourselves, because the war with muslims has just begun.” certainly in the past decades the vast majority of terrorist activity has been undertaken in the name of islam. %$* 1
in some respects, islamism resembles the totalitarian movements of the first half of the twentieth century: the ruthless use of violence in pursuit of ideology and power by hitler, stalin and mao. %$* 1
just as most of their victims were their own people, most victims of islamist terror have been muslims. %$* 1
history is replete with examples of violent minorities who have held sway over peace loving majorities. %$* 1
perhaps the relevant question for this evening is what the majority of muslims believe. %$* 1
but perhaps it is whether islam, viewed as an ideological force, is in direct opposition to western interests and western values. %$* 1
should we respect islam as a religion of peace, or should we accept samuel huntington’s view that we are engaged in a clash of civilizations? %$* 1
or might this be a false dichotomy? %$* 1
can we honor our own traditions of pluralism and free exercise of religion, and accept that for the vast majority of muslims it is indeed a religion of peace, without compromising our ability to defend ourselves and our values against the ruthless few that wish us harm? %$* 1
well, these are subtle and complex questions, and we've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts this evening to explore them. %$* 1
it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to our moderator, john donvan, but before i do so i'd like to invite a round of applause to congratulate him on his third emmy award. %$* 1
thank you, and i was going to ask for another round for robert rosenkranz, and there it is. %$* 13
welcome everyone, to another debate from intelligence squared u.s. i’m john donvan of abc news, and once again it is my honor to act as moderator as the four debaters you see sharing this stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university-- %$* 13
four debaters, two against two, will be debating this motion: “islam is a religion of peace.” now, this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be winners and losers, and you, our audience, will be acting as the judges. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended you will have been asked to vote twice, once before and once again after the debate, on where you stand on this motion, and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let’s go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads on your seat, our motion is “islam is a religion of peace.” if you are for the motion, press number one. %$* 13
if you are against the motion, press number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided, press number three. %$* 13
you can correct any mistake just by repressing, and ignore the other numbers. %$* 13
and we will present the results of both votes for you at the end of the evening, and that’s how we will know who our winner is. %$* 13
so, opening round-- %$* 13
sorry, let me put it this way: round one is opening statements by each side, seven minutes in turn, and i would like to begin by introducing our first speaker for the motion “islam is a religion of peace.” i’d like to introduce zeba khan, the only american on our panel and quite possibly the youngest debater ever to take part in an intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
welcome, zeba. %$* 13
i know that i first became aware of you when the washington post was running a reality game show to name america’s next pundit. %$* 13
they had 1,400 entrants, and what place did you come in? %$* 13
they had 4,800 entrants, actually. %$* 330
4,800. and you came in %$* 13
i came in second. %$* 330
second. %$* 13
well, look where you are now. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, zeba khan. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 330
i want to express my deepest gratitude to mr. %$* 330
rosenkranz and the intelligence squared forum for allowing me to speak tonight alongside such well-known and far more distinguished co-panelists. %$* 330
this is particularly an honor for me because, let’s be honest, i haven’t written a book, i’m not a regular on national t.v.or radio. %$* 330
what i have is my story. %$* 330
i am a muslim american woman born and raised in toledo, ohio by two very loving indian muslim parents. %$* 330
my sister, brother, and i were raised in a middle-class american home. %$* 330
we went to mosque on sundays, attended sunday school classes, and prayed the community prayer with our community of pakistanis, lebanese, and syrian muslims. %$* 330
when i was in high school, our mosque president was a woman, who did not wear a headscarf. %$* 330
and it may come as a surprise to some of you, but for the entirety of my life men and women have prayed side by side at our mosque, and both can enter the prayer hall using the same door. %$* 330
my parents are both very religious people, but they express their faith in different ways. %$* 330
my father emphasizes the devotional, and he tends to spend his time praying and reciting the koran, whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach. %$* 330
she uses community service and volunteering to express hers. %$* 330
but what they both share is fundamental islamic principles. %$* 330
first and foremost, seek knowledge. %$* 330
they urged their children, all three of us, to question, to have critical minds, and to doubt. %$* 330
they wanted us to engage fully with our faith and to question everything. %$* 330
they lived out the koranic commandments that there is no compulsion in religion, and also that god said, in the koran, “i made you into many tribes so that you might know one another.” and as such, they enrolled me and my siblings in a hebrew day school for nine years, where we learned hebrew, read the torah, and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning. %$* 330
they always wanted us to learn about other faiths, and they always made sure that we knew the difference, though, between islam and judaism. %$* 330
but they also made sure we also respected our jewish sisters and brothers in faith. %$* 330
my story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries. %$* 330
the muslim population is one of the most diverse and eclectic in the world. %$* 330
we are sunnis, we are shias, and even in the shia tradition there are zaidis, ismailis, ismasheries there are numerous madhhabs, or schools of thought, and sufi mystic orders. %$* 330
like christians and jews, muslims can be observant, nonobservant, performist, humanist, secularist, extremist, mainstream, and there are even some muslims who consider themselves culturally muslims but are actually atheists. %$* 330
now, the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether islam is a religion of peace. %$* 330
and at first blush, that might seem a bit tricky to decide. %$* 330
after all, the koran and the hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love. %$* 330
but there are other verses that are violent, are about violence and about violence against specific people. %$* 330
so how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses? %$* 330
how then do we decide whether islam is a religion of peace? %$* 330
the only way to answer that question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how they interpret it. %$* 330
according to gallup's ground breaking study on what a billion muslims think, 93 percent of muslims around the world are peaceful, mainstream muslims. %$* 330
seven percent are what gallup determines as politically radicalized. %$* 330
and within that seven percent, there's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence. %$* 330
any percent is too much. %$* 330
but we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivated by politics, not religion. %$* 330
as gallup concluded, what distinguishes the politically radicalized muslims from the mainstream muslims is their politics, not their piety. %$* 330
robert pape, a university of chicago political scientist, further confirmed this in his book, dying to win, in which he came to the same conclusion, that the actions of terrorists are politically motivated, not through religion. %$* 330
the tamil tigers, for example, which are predominantly a hindu group, used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing, did so far secessionist reasons, not for religious goals. %$* 330
our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all, no winner clash between islam and the west, and that muslims who try to balance their western values and islam arrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internal struggle. %$* 330
that distribution description doesn't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends or for my community, because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict with each other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other. %$* 330
i didn't realize that there were people out there who wondered whether people-- %$* 330
muslims like me existed or could exist until after 9/11. %$* 330
let me be clear. %$* 330
there are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist our faith to justify their hate and their violence. %$* 330
but i am here to tell you they don't speak for islam. %$* 330
mohammad hamdani a first responder who died on 9/11, speaks for islam. %$* 330
hassan askari, a brooklyn muslim who stepped in on the subway and saved a complete stranger who was being physically attacked because he was jewish, he speaks for islam. %$* 330
zainab salbi, through her organization women for women international, has assisted forever a quarter of a million women across the world. %$* 330
she speaks for islam. %$* 330
and the entire muslim community of india, who, when the authorities asked them to take the militants who attacked mumbai in 2008, said resoundingly and collectively no. %$* 330
we will not let the terrorists be buried with us. %$* 330
the media and those who profit from the narrative of islam versus the west are never going to tell you my story or the stories of these muslims who constitute the vast majority of muslims around the world. %$* 330
but just because you may not hear us, it doesn't mean we're not speaking out. %$* 330
and just because you may not see us on tv, it doesn't mean we don't exist. %$* 330
if you vote against the motion, i would argue you're voting against the moderate voices of mainstream islam and telling the terrorists that you agree with their version. %$* 330
i urge to you vote for the motion. %$* 330
thank you. %$* 330
thank you, zeba khan. %$* 13
our motion is, “islam is a religion of peace.” you have heard the opening statement in support of this motion. %$* 13
now to speak first against the motion that islam is a religion of peace, i'd like to introduce ayaan hirsi ali, a very, very well-known dissident, born in somalia, fled to the netherlands, where she was a member of the parliament, the dutch parliament. %$* 13
now she is in the united states, once again on a case of asylum because-- %$* 13
ayaan? %$* 13
well, because i had to live with-- %$* 331
basically, i was afraid for my life. %$* 331
ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
in the 21st century, in a free country. %$* 331
ladies and gentlemen, ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, i am surprised by the motion itself. %$* 331
when i first heard it, it reminded me of the academic question, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? %$* 331
and i think, well, if you do the salsa or the cha cha, not many. %$* 331
why are we not having a motion on is christianity a religion of peace, is judaism a religion of peace, et cetera? %$* 331
because those would be academic motions. %$* 331
unfortunately, the motion, “islam is a religion of peace” is not academic. %$* 331
i respect and admire zeba khan. %$* 331
and i want to acknowledge the fact that you indeed are a demonstration of the assimilation of a muslim individual, a muslim woman into western society, into an american society. %$* 331
but you come from a middle class family that was very eclectic and respected pluralism. %$* 331
i respect that very much, and i admire you for it. %$* 331
and i think you are an example to others. %$* 331
however, i disagree with you that you represent islam or that you speak for islam. %$* 331
the problem that is inherent in islam from the time of its foundation up to this moment is who speaks for islam. %$* 331
and i’ll get to that later on. %$* 331
is it zeba khan or is it faisal shahzad? %$* 331
he was also a middle class man, went to business school, married an american woman, had two children, lived just like you, like many of you. %$* 331
and yet, he made a different choice based on a combination of piety and politics. %$* 331
and that's what islam is. %$* 331
and before i go on, let me define the key terms of the motion. %$* 331
first, religion. %$* 331
the most common definition of religion you will find is the universal quest of humans in search-- %$* 331
in search of the sacred or the holy. %$* 331
that search is expressed intellectually. %$* 331
it's expressed in practice. %$* 331
it is expressed in fellowship. %$* 331
and you look at the religion like islam, on an intellectual level it was expressed by the founder of islam as a demolition of all other gods. %$* 331
polytheism had to end, and all humanity had to be united under one god. %$* 331
from those of you who are familiar with history, and i think a crowd like this is, you know that no monotheistic religion can be a religion of peace. %$* 331
no monotheistic religion is a religion of peace, and definitely not islam. %$* 331
monotheistic religions know periods, lengthy periods of peace, but they also know lengthy periods of war. %$* 331
in times of practice, yes, in islam, you practice charity, you go to hajj, you pray, all of that. %$* 331
but in terms of practice, there is also the expression, there is the concept of jihad. %$* 331
and i find it a pity that zeba khan did not mention that concept, which is central to islam's conquests and islam's success. %$* 331
the founder of islam, mohammad, in his lifetime, conducted 65 campaigns of war that were all successful. %$* 331
and that militaristic history of islam is well documented. %$* 331
just go google it. %$* 331
and if you don't find it on google, go to all those former empires that were conquered. %$* 331
the combination of a history of empire, of conquest, also leaves a legacy behind. %$* 331
and that legacy is the thrusting together of people of different ethnicities, languages, et cetera. %$* 331
so even if that empire declines, the likelihood, the likelihood of conflict, of war, is probable. %$* 331
it's high, especially where there is a fault line. %$* 331
that's where samuel huntington had a point. %$* 331
that history of militarism, combined with the legacy of empire, those two points alone belie the motion tonight, that islam is a religion of peace, but that's not all. %$* 331
when empires decline, those who are defeated, and the muslim empire declined, those who are defeated sometimes themselves in a state of victimhood. %$* 331
that state of victimhood is exploited by the leadership or the self-appointed leaders of islam. %$* 331
and what do you see? %$* 331
you see a number of people, and i concede it's a minority, who believe that islam is under siege. %$* 331
a mentality of victimhood tells those who are conquered, who are vanquished, that the problem was caused by external powers, not by us, and that systematic denial within islam after the 19th century to blame only outsiders exempts islam from blame, from the explanation what went wrong. %$* 331
yes, it was external, yes, muslims were humiliated, yes, they were conquered, yes, they were colonized, but how much was also because of the flaws of islam? %$* 331
and that takes me to the point of absolutism. %$* 331
when the west went into its scientific revolution, why wasn't it muslims? %$* 331
muslims were the first scientists, arithmetic, logic, et cetera. %$* 331
they were great; why didn't they get into that scientific revolution? %$* 331
why were they left behind? %$* 331
was it only because of external factors or were there internal flaws? %$* 331
that combination of a status of victimhood and the absolutism-- %$* 331
the demand that you can never revise or reflect on the koran, that you can never, never ever refute what mohammad said, you can only follow his example-- %$* 331
that absolutism combined with that status of victimhood also enlarges the likelihood of conflict, and those two combined like the other two factors like-- %$* 331
thank you. %$* 331
that belies the motion. %$* 331
i'll keep my last two factors for the time i have remaining, thank you. %$* 331
all right, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 331
that belies the motion. %$* 331
i'll keep my last two factors for the time i have remaining, thank you. %$* 331
thank you. %$* 13
are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "islam is a religion of peace." you have heard from the first two debaters in their opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce maajid nawaz, who is director of the quilliam foundation, and he has an amazing biography, and several years back, would have been america's nightmare. %$* 13
he was a radical, he was imprisoned in egypt while on a trip there, though he's born in the u.k., was in egypt and tortured for being a radical, and something happened to you in prison, 180-degree turn-- %$* 13
in one sentence, what was it? %$* 13
in one sentence. %$* 332
yeah. %$* 13
you're talking about four years now. %$* 332
yeah. %$* 13
amnesty international. %$* 332
well, i'll explain that and hopefully %$* 332
fair enough. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, maajid nawaz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 332
can i indulge the audience and just ask for a round of applause for zeba's mom, she's just over there, i think she did a wonderful job. %$* 332
to raise your daughter to speak hebrew in the current climate is amazing and i applaud you. %$* 332
so, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity. %$* 332
i want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about. %$* 332
this debate is not about making excuses for terrorism. %$* 332
basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the west and also in muslim majority countries. %$* 332
i've just flown right in from pakistan where i've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in pakistan. %$* 332
and i'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on facebook. %$* 332
so this debate-- %$* 332
this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside israel. %$* 332
we make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism, for extremism, and for people who kill innocent civilians, including inside israel. %$* 332
this debate acknowledges, we, on our panel, zeba and myself, acknowledge that muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it, and more muslims need to do that more actively. %$* 332
we acknowledge that muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those-- %$* 332
the minority who have hijacked islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of islam. %$* 332
we acknowledge that, and i am in my own person a manifestation of that effort, as is zeba in the way she was raised. %$* 332
so we acknowledge that as well. %$* 332
this debate, in fact, is an appeal. %$* 332
it’s not-- %$* 332
also, before i move to the fact that it’s an appeal, it’s also not a threat. %$* 332
so, we’re not going to argue here tonight that if you don’t vote for the motion, that somehow muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting islam. %$* 332
that’s not the case. %$* 332
this is an appeal. %$* 332
and it’s an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you. %$* 332
this is not a debate for islam at all. %$* 332
this is a debate for peace. %$* 332
and we are not arguing for islamic peace; we’re arguing for islam to be-- %$* 332
with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith-- %$* 332
to be part of the effort to create peace in the world. %$* 332
so this is a debate for peace. %$* 332
it’s a debate, and i’m asking you all to vote tonight not for islam, but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace. %$* 332
because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred. %$* 332
i used to believe that islam is not a religion of peace. %$* 332
in fact, i used to believe that islam mandates war. %$* 332
i used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest. %$* 332
i called it jihad. %$* 332
i believed that islam was not a religion of peace because i adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after i was released from prison when i was 28 years old. %$* 332
by that time i had established this ideology in pakistan and in denmark and contributed to its growth in egypt. %$* 332
but i learned in prison two things. %$* 332
one was what i’m appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch, it does work. %$* 332
people i’d considered my enemy, people i’d considered the enemy of my people, amnesty international with their advocation of human rights that i believed was a tool to colonize the minds of muslims, adopted me as a prisoner of conscience. %$* 332
and by handing me that olive branch, i recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless of the provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate. %$* 332
and that’s what i’m asking you to do here tonight. %$* 332
because by redefining the debate, and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me, they changed my heart. %$* 332
i went on and took that message forward and helped establish the world’s first counter-extremism think tank in the west, then went into pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in pakistan. %$* 332
and as i said, we had 10,000 supporters before we’d even launched, of muslims in pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that this should be a world of war, not just islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds. %$* 332
whether that’s because they want to fight or because they don’t believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis. %$* 332
and so i make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate. %$* 332
and the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that i had the opportunity-- %$* 332
i won’t say good fortune because it wasn’t really that-- %$* 332
but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an egyptian prison, ironically built by the british. %$* 332
and what i learned was that i had been extremely arrogant. %$* 332
i had suffered from the failure that i saw here tonight in my respected colleagues’ presentation. %$* 332
i had failed to contextualize history, and when i was this young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, who’d been stabbed at multiple times growing up on the streets of essex, who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling-- %$* 332
i was a very angry young man. %$* 332
but i went to men in prison, who had been in prison since i was three years old, and then i met them at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and i had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didn’t understand that true islam was a religion of war. %$* 332
and they said to me, “young lad, come and sit down. %$* 332
we’ll tell you a story or two.” and over the course of the four years, after having learned arabic, after having memorized half of the koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not being too much of a religious man, i came to the conclusion that islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that i now refer to as islamism, the modern ideology that owes more to post world war i european fascism than it does to the traditions of islam. %$* 332
and these former jihadists, among them the assassins of egypt's former president, anwar sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions. %$* 332
and so i appeal to all of you as my time runs out-- %$* 332
there is much more to say-- %$* 332
to vote to help us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change. %$* 332
and that's exactly how the civil rights movement in america tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past. %$* 332
thank you for your patience, and thank you for your time. %$* 332
our motion is, “islam is a religion of peace.” and now to speak against the motion, douglas murray. %$* 13
he is a best selling author and founder and director of the center for social cohesion, also a citizen of the united kingdom, a member of the church of england until recently. %$* 13
you said that your study of the koran-- %$* 13
you said this in print-- %$* 13
made you an atheist. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 333
i said mohammad made me an atheist. %$* 333
the publisher said at the time that it's a pretty provocative headline. %$* 333
i said, “well, get somebody to do the next one.” she said, “i could find a catholic who could say mohammad made me a catholic.” i said, “how about trying to make a three-part article and get a third one of somebody saying mohammad made me a jew.” and that one would be the trouble. %$* 333
douglas murray, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 333
it's a great pleasure to be here tonight. %$* 333
i'm sorry to make this panel rather brit-centric after my colleague maajid. %$* 333
it isn't an attempt by us to have a british takeover of the old colony or anything like that. %$* 333
but i was coming earlier from my own fallen empire, going back to my friend and colleague ayaan's comments earlier. %$* 333
and i was reading the paper, as i'm sure all of you were doing all yesterday. %$* 333
maajid finished his comments by talking about the importance of changing paradigms. %$* 333
i'm not sure it is about paradigms. %$* 333
i think it's about facts. %$* 333
here are some facts. %$* 333
in my newspaper earlier, the times square bomber, of course, a man just up the road from here, who tried to kill thousands of people, only, by the way, didn't manage it because he set the 24-hour timing device at 7:00 a.m. %$* 333
instead of 7:00 p.m., 1900 hours was what it was meant to be. %$* 333
if he had to have got that bit right, thousands of new yorkers would have died earlier this year, again. %$* 333
i see further in the paper 12 suspects arrested in france in a network trying to recruit people to go in to fight american and other troops in afghanistan. %$* 333
i turn to another page of the newspaper, in the city i had just flown off from this morning, a muslim london underground worker who was-- %$* 333
had written to his wife who was off to - - tried to become a martyr for allah, as he said. %$* 333
he said, “more than anything i wish allah to grant me martyrdom." ladies and gentlemen, we have to look at facts. %$* 333
we should also, just quickly-- %$* 333
if i may refer something to the wording of tonight's debate, ayaan's already mentioned it. %$* 333
but let me put it this way. %$* 333
you're, i'm sure, a liberal minded new york audience. %$* 333
at least i hope you are. %$* 333
we will see. %$* 333
but i imagine that if the motion we had here tonight was “christianity is a religion of peace,” we get to the q and a, perhaps even before, and somebody would say if the other side were arguing for that, somebody would say, "what about the crusades, hmm? %$* 333
what about that? %$* 333
" then there'd be some other clever clarks who'd say, “i-- %$* 333
what about that florida pastor the other week? %$* 333
there was a nasty business. %$* 333
that's christianity for you.” if we'd have had tonight judaism is a religion of peace, the other side would try to argue that. %$* 333
sure as anything, there'd be people popping up in the hall tonight saying, “oh, there's this bit in one of the old testament books, really, really bad, all sorts of massacres going on. %$* 333
why don't you talk about that? %$* 333
” there might even be people trying to say that religion-- %$* 333
the argument that judaism was a religion of peace couldn't be argued because people would say look at what israel is doing. %$* 333
and isn't that a direct and so on. %$* 333
so let's not have a debate about islam and whether or not islam is a religion of peace without talking about the facts to do with islam. %$* 333
it's an absurd situation we're in, where nothing that anyone does whilst being muslim is any responsibility of islam. %$* 333
yet anything anyone does whilst being a christian or a jew is the responsibility of all christians, all jews. %$* 333
let's make this as straightforward as i can. %$* 333
take the categorization that eminent scholars like bernard lewis and ibn warraq have made. %$* 333
let's say islam is a very, very complex thing. %$* 333
and the best way i can do this in the very short time i have, is say you have three islams, islam one, two, and three. %$* 333
islam one, the koran and the life of mohammad and the hadith. %$* 333
islam two, the tradition of the sharia. %$* 333
islam three, what muslims do now. %$* 333
the first of those things, islam, the koran and so on, is bad. %$* 333
it is bad. %$* 333
there is a lot of violence in it. %$* 333
and what's worse, the peaceful verses are superseded by the violent verses. %$* 333
the violent verses also sadly are more numerous in number. %$* 333
then you've got the life of mohammad. %$* 333
again, a bad man, a very bad man. %$* 333
it happens to be that not a great role model if you look at it. %$* 333
takes child brides, abuses a small girl, multiple wives, himself a warrior, himself a war criminal, himself beheads jews. %$* 333
this, i would have thought, would be a signal of not great peacefulness. %$* 333
then you've got the tradition of the sharia, again, not great peacefulness, still no schools of sharia that people in this hall would want to submit to. %$* 333
and thirdly, what muslims do now. %$* 333
thankfully, there is some hope in that one, because most muslims, thank goodness-- %$* 333
i almost said thank god, but-- %$* 333
old habits die-hard. %$* 333
most muslims don't do what those texts say because they exercise their judgment as moral beings without having to refer to defunct holy books. %$* 333
now, look, i wish that zeba and maajid were the spokespeople of islam. %$* 333
it would be lovely. %$* 333
although in maajid's case, it would have taken rather too long if everyone had to go 14 years of preaching the downfall of america and then said no, not so much. %$* 333
but we are where we are. %$* 333
anyhow, i wish they spoke for islam. %$* 333
it would be great. %$* 333
but the fact is that tonight, the organizers of this debate asked a number of clerics, none of them which showed, specifically they wouldn't show and debate against ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 333
myself, i don't think they cared. %$* 333
but no, it's very interesting. %$* 333
they will not debate. %$* 333
time and again, muslims-- %$* 333
the actual leaders of your religion will not debate this. %$* 333
and you are left with people-- %$* 333
now here, the reasons why of course is the leaders of the religion show such terrible-- %$* 333
terrible lessons. %$* 333
it is not a small thing. %$* 333
it's not as if it were a detail. %$* 333
it's not like a wacky florida pastor. %$* 333
but you've got the largest sunni state of saudi arabia, the most important sunni state in the world, the most extraordinary closed prison of a society. %$* 333
it's not a detail. %$* 333
it's not a one-off nut job. %$* 333
the shiite republic of iran is what it is, led by the people it's led by. %$* 333
that is not an accident. %$* 333
it's not a detail. %$* 333
the thing that worries me is that although tonight we hear from the panelists here about how islam is a religion of peace, the fact is that the people who are making the decisions in the religion, the people who are preaching the religion, the heads of that religion, people like sheikh qaradawi who broadcasts anti-semitic-- %$* 333
the most appalling filth every week on the main network, that is the faith that is speaking for you guys. %$* 333
i wish that zeba, you were on every week on al jazeera, but you are not. %$* 333
qaradawi is. %$* 333
the problem is that islam is an unstable component, as a religion, an unstable component. %$* 333
a thousand years ago, the mustabalites tried to reform the religion. %$* 333
they were wiped out. %$* 333
the fact is that islam is many things, many, many things. %$* 333
but to say it's a religion of peace is nonsense. %$* 333
it's to ignore reality. %$* 333
it's to ignore very difficult but necessary facts, not paradigms, but facts. %$* 333
to say that islam is a religion of peace is to say something based entirely on hope. %$* 333
it's to elevate a hope into truth. %$* 333
and i hope, as you will note, history teaches us that's a very bad thing to do. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 333
thank you, douglas murray. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
we have heard opening statements. %$* 13
we're going to move into round two. %$* 13
remember how you voted in the beginning. %$* 13
we're going to move into round two, in which the debaters address one another directly. %$* 13
they will be taking questions from me and then questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
so, i just want to state where we are. %$* 13
this is an intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i am john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have two teams of debaters arguing out this motion: “islam is a religion of peace.” the side arguing for the motion, zeba khan and maajid nawaz, have been arguing-- %$* 13
make the argument that the extremists do not define islam. %$* 13
take away the extremists, and you have a religion of peace. %$* 13
the side arguing against, ayaan hirsi ali and douglas murray, argue it's not about extremists. %$* 13
it's inherent. %$* 13
it's inherent in the tradition. %$* 13
it's inherent in the scripture, and it's inherent in the history. %$* 13
and so the question of the notion, ayaan hirsi ali, of this not just being about extremists, you can see that there are extremists, but that's, you say, not the problem, what about your opponents, what about your parents, what about muslims you know who do not adhere to a violent form of religion, are they-- %$* 13
if there's something about the faith themselves, are they embracing spiritually something that is morally an illusion? %$* 13
well, my parents and people like my respectful opponents here are ignoring the basic tenets of their religion. %$* 331
when mohammad, the founder of the religion, called out to all muslims-- %$* 331
and that's how he won most of his wars, by saying, "i have been ordered and all believing men have been ordered to attack and kill and maim anyone unless they testify, unless all men testify to the fact that allah is the one and only, mohammad is his messenger, my father disobeys that. %$* 331
well, maajid nawaz tried to obey that first and then stopped obeying it. %$* 331
but the fact that that scripture is there and that history of militarism is there belies the motion that islam is a religion of peace. %$* 331
the point i want to make is islam is a religion, when you take the scripture, that can be employed to wage war, and islam as a civilization has known periods of peace, but you cannot-- %$* 331
if you pay attention to that history, pay attention to the evidence-- %$* 331
continue to say that islam is a religion of peace. %$* 331
no monotheistic religion is a religion of peace. %$* 331
no monotheistic religion is only a religion of war. %$* 331
it is both. %$* 331
but in islam, and that's why we are debating it in the 21st century, there are more occurrences of violence and war and strife and subjection of women then there are in other religions. %$* 331
and my point-- %$* 331
our point is, let's not deny it, because by denying it we don't solve the problem. %$* 331
let's admit it and then as intelligent people take it from there. %$* 331
what is to blame on external factors, what is to blame on the inside? %$* 331
let me just hear opponent maajid nawaz, who was an extremist, now an anti-extremist, maajid, respond. %$* 13
so, forgive me for the assumption, ayaan, it's a pleasure to be on the panel with you, by the way, but forgive me for the assumption, but do you speak arabic? %$* 332
have you studied arabic grammar? %$* 332
and i'm asking for a purpose, which if you do give me the chance to explain i will, but that first of all just let me ask you that question. %$* 332
i don't speak it as well as you do. %$* 331
and i want to know where the question is going before i give a full answer to that. %$* 331
if you want me to quote the koran i will. %$* 331
you may be surprised, i don't know if i speak well or not, but the reason i'm asking is that you just quoted hadith, of the prophet, and you actually really did exaggerate what he said, and i'll quote to you the exact hadith in arabic and then translate it. %$* 332
now, what you quoted was-- %$* 332
it’s actually the koran, but go on. %$* 331
well, hadith is %$* 332
it’s chapter 2, 191 to 193-- %$* 331
wait, just %$* 13
now, what you quoted and in the translation was, "kill and maim," and you went on and explained. %$* 332
now actually means "to fight." now, i'm not saying that that's a good hadith. %$* 332
what i'm saying is when we're translating, let's try and be accurate. %$* 332
and that brings me to the point, and that is that i just thought of a word to describe this, and it's just come to me so thank you because i want to use it forever onwards, and that is suspended intelligence. %$* 332
there's a tendency when discussing islam to suspend the tools that we have learned and studied, and that you have studied as well, that we use to analyze every other piece of scripture and literature in the world, and that is that we recognize that texts do not speak for themselves. %$* 332
we recognize that when we interpret scriptures and texts and books and poetry that they are contextualized, that we have methodologies to approach them, when we're reading shakespeare, when we're reading anything. %$* 332
we recognize that there's a way to interpret text and there are schools of thought and differences over how to approach texts. %$* 332
now, if we contextualize martin luther, and say the reformation was a good thing, despite the fact that he said, "kill and slay the peasants wherever you find them," when they follow thomas muntzer-- %$* 332
when he was calling for not just breaking away from the papal authority but also for rebelling against the monarchies and the dictators that they found themselves in-- %$* 332
martin luther sided with the tyrants against muntzer, and said, "kill the peasants wherever you find them." despite that, i'm prepared to say the reformation was a good thing. %$* 332
and the reason i'm prepared to say that is that martin luther must not be judged by the standards of civilization that we, after an accumulation of thousands of years, have arrived at. %$* 332
he must be judged by the standards of civilization that were around during his time. %$* 332
and that's how society evolves. %$* 332
i-- %$* 331
hang on. %$* 13
and we recognize that for every other faith and for every other piece of literature, yet when it comes to islam somehow we want to suspend. %$* 332
but we learned about that and quote the %$* 332
yes, we read things in their context. %$* 333
i mean, you read chaucer in context. %$* 333
chaucer doesn't have followers, doesn't have 1.4 billion people who believe every, or are meant to believe %$* 333
sorry, i quoted martin luther not chaucer. %$* 332
i suppose martin luther does have followers-- %$* 332
if you allowed me to speak, i would address your lesser point. %$* 333
i will get there i promise. %$* 333
you don’t-- %$* 333
we don’t have followers of shakespeare who insist on, going to insist on following line-by-line everything shakespeare did and believing everything he wrote. %$* 333
that’s because it’s literature. %$* 333
actually what’s happening, maajid, you put your finger on the problem. %$* 333
it’s not us that’s not applying the rigorous critical faculty. %$* 333
we’re applying it to the koran as we would to any other work of literature. %$* 333
you’re not because you can’t. %$* 333
and the final thing is, maajid, because maajid knows very well that-- %$* 333
he is a believer and believers are not allowed to contextualize the text. %$* 331
is that true? %$* 13
because if you were allowed to contextualize, you would say some of the things that mohammad did is crap. %$* 331
you would say some of the deeds-- %$* 331
maajid, is it true that you cannot-- %$* 13
you cannot contextualize. %$* 331
maajid, is that true? %$* 13
no, that’s not true. %$* 332
what do you think of mohammad taking a six year old as a bride? %$* 331
what do you think of that? %$* 331
i don’t think that’s a particularly good idea. %$* 332
however, what i would say-- %$* 332
glad to hear it. %$* 333
there were many, many people in history that have done such a thing and what we’re talking about here is a failure to contextualize actions for the standards of their time. %$* 332
and i’ll come back to the point i made, because douglas, you didn’t address it, despite your protestations-- %$* 332
let me just ask you again. %$* 332
martin luther was a fundamentalist, wasn’t he? %$* 332
absolutely. %$* 333
if there were currently lutherans, and there are lutherans around. %$* 333
you meet them occasionally in scandinavia and so on. %$* 333
very nice people. %$* 333
nice people and peaceable guys they are by and large. %$* 333
if, however, there was a large proportion of lutherans somewhere in scandinavia that started blowing up non- lutherans-- %$* 333
or no, sorry absolutely right-- %$* 333
started massacring peasants, do you think that people would say, hang on a minute, “let’s not criticize martin luther. %$* 333
he did that by the standards of his time. %$* 333
we shouldn’t criticize his followers all that much. %$* 333
we shouldn’t point out that what he said.” no. %$* 333
we just say, “you know, don’t go and massacre peasants. %$* 333
full stop. %$* 333
it was rubbish at the time and it is now.” it’s the same with the koran. %$* 333
you’re missing the point. %$* 332
you’re failing to judge-- %$* 332
i just wanted to point out, when we’re talking about the koran and saying that we can’t contextualize it, that’s simply not true. %$* 330
that is a debate that’s hot in the community amongst muslim scholars and amongst muslims themselves. %$* 330
we’re debating that very question. %$* 330
is the koran a living document? %$* 330
much like-- %$* 330
it’s similar in comparison to the constitution and the debates that happen around that. %$* 330
the fact is scholars say that when you look at the koran in arabic, there can be two, three, four, five, six interpretations for every word. %$* 330
there’re only certain things in the koran that scholars agree are concrete, like the concept of god, afterlife, things like that. %$* 330
but beyond that there is a wide, wide range of interpretation, which is why there is a history that not many people look at, and that’s part of the problem. %$* 330
that nobody’s actually looked at the history of debate within islam about every sort of aspect that can come to mind. %$* 330
i disagree with that. %$* 331
the reason i disagree with that-- %$* 331
it would be more accurate, zeba, if you said the scholars that you find attractive say that. %$* 331
but there’s a bunch of scholars, a great number of following in islam, take-- %$* 331
all of them are self-appointed by the way, because there is no higher education, there is no seminary of islam, except the university of al-azhar, we know the products of al-azhar, but there are scholars like bin laden who say we have to take-- %$* 331
he’s not a scholar by anyone’s measure. %$* 330
well he has the greatest following. %$* 331
he has the greatest following. %$* 331
that’s not true. %$* 330
the islamic brotherhood, hassan al-banna, when you to look at the sunni islam. %$* 331
when you look at the ayatollah khomeini in the 20th century, the most influential guy of shia islam is another self-appointed scholar. %$* 331
sheikh bin baz, he has the greatest following. %$* 331
sheikh al qaradawi. %$* 331
maybe these are individuals that are not attractive to you, but then it would be more accurate if you stated that. %$* 331

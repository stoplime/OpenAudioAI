christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
but the opposite of male dominance is not female dominance. %$* 519
it's mutuality. %$* 519
that's fine. %$* 518
men are still finished. %$* 518
i mean, men are finished as the dominant sex. %$* 518
i'm not-- %$* 518
they are not finished. %$* 519
that's absurd. %$* 519
you agreed to it in your opening that you didn't want to say men are finished. %$* 519
you thought there might be inklings of a suggestion that it may be happening. %$* 519
but what you're defending now is that men are finished. %$* 519
i'm saying it's absurd. %$* 519
i'm saying that some men are in trouble. %$* 519
but rather than declare their extinction, we should be doing what we can to help them. %$* 519
and that is-- %$* 519
totally. %$* 518
not happening in our schools. %$* 519
our schools are-- %$* 519
i'm not saying we should crush them further. %$* 518
i mean-- %$* 518
well, let's talk about-- %$* 13
dan abrams. %$* 13
you say we need to-- %$* 520
we need to do that in our schools, and yet that's exactly what universities have tried, which is to have affirmative action for men. %$* 520
it's gotten that bad. %$* 520
and the problem is that the civil rights-- %$* 520
wait. %$* 518
why are they laughing? %$* 518
this is true. %$* 518
yeah. %$* 520
schools have affirmative action for men. %$* 518
no, and the civil rights commission actually investigated this, and may investigate it again because the situation has gotten so dire at our universities that we feel the need to discriminate against women. %$* 520
is that the solution? %$* 520
that's frightening. %$* 520
christina. %$* 13
the civil rights commission chose not to investigate it. %$* 519
it never happened, but-- %$* 519
no, they did investigate it. %$* 520
they-- %$* 519
they did not. %$* 519
they did not. %$* 519
they-- %$* 518
i know-- %$* 518
however, they-- %$* 519
as to why they shut down the investigation and-- %$* 518
it doesn't matter. %$* 519
believe me-- %$* 518
they shut it down. %$* 519
you don't want to get into why they shut %$* 518
because they did not want to get into it and-- %$* 519
all right. %$* 13
let's move forward on the impasse. %$* 13
let's move forward. %$* 13
let's not have an impasse. %$* 519
but if you look at the early grades as how young men are treated in our schools, it's a very girl friendly environment. %$* 519
and boys are not keeping up with-- %$* 519
with the girls. %$* 519
but does that mean boys are finished? %$* 13
we had massive effort-- %$* 519
well-- %$* 519
but seriously, is that-- %$* 13
is that not-- %$* 13
christina, is that not indicative of-- %$* 13
of their argument that the system is set up in such a way that males, let's say, are on a bad track? %$* 13
males aren't on a bad track. %$* 519
but our system is rigged against them. %$* 519
and if you look into the average classroom, it's a male averse environment. %$* 519
schools, for example, now don't allow rough and tumble play. %$* 519
there is zero tolerance for male rambunctiousness. %$* 519
you have schools where they don't allow them to play tag where anyone is out. %$* 519
they have to replace it with games like circle of friends, tug-of-war. %$* 519
tug-of-war has become tug of peace. %$* 519
this is not-- %$* 519
this is hostile to the interests of young men. %$* 519
and it gets more serious if you look at the readings. %$* 519
a friend of mine at harvard graduate school of education did a content analysis of textbooks, readers for eighth and-- %$* 519
seventh and eighth grade social studies class. %$* 519
she said you'd think the american west was settled by teenage girls traveling with parents. %$* 519
so male heroes have been taken out. %$* 519
boys are badly neglected. %$* 519
well-- %$* 13
now-- %$* 519
just one last point. %$* 519
we did a lot to help girls and to strengthen them in math and science. %$* 519
at the same time, we did nothing to help boys with their reading and writing skills and their college matriculation-- %$* 519
but it seems like you're-- %$* 520
dan abrams. %$* 13
conceding that men are finished. %$* 520
i mean, what you're doing is you're saying, yes, men are finished, and here's why we need to change it. %$* 520
i said men are in trouble. %$* 519
that's not the same as saying they are finished. %$* 519
david-- %$* 13
david zinczenko. %$* 13
i mean, i would just say that-- %$* 521
david, could you move just a tiny bit to-- %$* 13
i mean, what's happening here is what needs to happen. %$* 521
they are on the ridiculous side of this issue. %$* 521
so they have to attempt to redefine it. %$* 521
if the issue is that the stranglehold on men is coming to the end or men omnipotence is finished, well, two things would be happening. %$* 521
we would be conceding right off the bat that men's omnipotence is finished, and this debate would be taking place in 1962, okay. %$* 521
the fact is that, at this point, we have come to accept a shared power structure between men and women. %$* 521
and it really doesn't matter. %$* 521
it's not the issue that we're really discussing here, which is why you have to vote against this motion. %$* 521
wait. %$* 518
what was that phrase you used, surviving off the fumes of sexism? %$* 518
i think we are our finest example there. %$* 518
well, i'm-- %$* 521
david zinczenko. %$* 13
oh, you want to concede to hanna rosin. %$* 13
i think you scored on that one. %$* 13
i want to make another point about police officers which christina made a reference to consistently, and i think it's indicative, actually, of the larger issue, which is people like to think, oh, you know, men will be the better police officers because they're bigger and stronger. %$* 520
and if i was out there, and i needed someone, i'd want a big, strong police officer. %$* 520
well, okay in certain cases. %$* 520
but what if i told you that there is solid evidence to demonstrate that women can defuse a violent situation better than men can? %$* 520
hmm. %$* 520
okay. %$* 520
now instead of having to tackle the guy, you can get the guy to a-- %$* 520
you can avoid a conflict altogether and then avoid taxpayer lawsuits and have less corruption within your police force. %$* 520
hmm. %$* 520
suddenly we're looking at police officers in a totally different way. %$* 520
does that mean that there's no advantage to being faster or bigger? %$* 520
no. %$* 520
but the number of times in real life as opposed to the movies where people are actually sort of running down across the street to catch the guy jumping over the fence is actually pretty far-- %$* 520
you know, it's pretty rare. %$* 520
all right, well-- %$* 519
christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
first of all, don't trust dan and-- %$* 519
and his statistics. %$* 519
he is-- %$* 519
he has a fairly serious case of-- %$* 519
and he's a columnist for men's health magazine. %$* 521
he has the hardest time getting his pieces through our fact-checking department. %$* 521
dan-- %$* 519
he is so fired, yeah, yeah. %$* 521
it's ridiculous. %$* 521
did you not say-- %$* 519
didn't you not claim in your book that women have better physical endurance? %$* 519
did you not claim that women could take pain better than men? %$* 519
yes. %$* 520
both of these things are false. %$* 519
there is a vast library of literature-- %$* 519
childbirth. %$* 518
childbirth. %$* 518
childbirth. %$* 518
epidural, epidural, invented by men. %$* 519
yes. %$* 520
sorry. %$* 520
what's the question? %$* 520
endurance, physical endurance. %$* 519
yeah. %$* 520
you think that women have better physical endurance. %$* 519
that's that there is an advantage that women have with estrogen and fat that provides them an advantage-- %$* 520
fat? %$* 519
it's true, yes. %$* 520
it's true. %$* 520
i rest my case. %$* 519
it allows-- %$* 520
i rest my case. %$* 519
it allows women to engage certain endurance activities better and longer than men. %$* 520
that does not mean they're faster. %$* 520
name one activity. %$* 519
i'll tell you one. %$* 520
in the-- %$* 520
in the ultra marathons is the only race where women can beat men, okay? %$* 520
this is-- %$* 520
don't clap. %$* 519
he's just wrong. %$* 519
he's got to be-- %$* 519
it's not true? %$* 520
am i making it up? %$* 520
you are making it up. %$* 519
that a woman won the ultra marathon. %$* 520
it's the only sport where men versus women, that women-- %$* 520
i didn't say always win. %$* 520
women can win. %$* 520
oh, one woman won in the mojave desert a couple of years ago. %$* 519
but wait a sec. %$* 520
wait a sec. %$* 520
there's a-- %$* 520
there's a huge record-- %$* 519
fact that a woman beat a man in an athletic competition is unheard of. %$* 520
the bottom line is men are still better athletes than women. %$* 520
men are stronger than women, and they're faster than women. %$* 520
but the one area where women can compete is in areas where it requires excessive endurance. %$* 520
and these ultra marathons are 135 miles plus. %$* 520
just to stop this discussion, there's some very good articles that have come out in recent years. %$* 519
just look at richard coast at northern arizona university who did a definitive study to undue this myth that was born in the '90s where they predicted women-- %$* 519
it came in nature magazine. %$* 519
they predicted women were going to win the marathon in 1998.it came and went. %$* 519
women didn't win. %$* 519
they're not going to win the marathon. %$* 520
they're not. %$* 520
the bottom line is men are-- %$* 520
and they're not winning the ultra marathon. %$* 519
no, it's not true. %$* 520
and what coast and other experts say is the longer and the-- %$* 519
the test of endurance, the greater the gap favoring males. %$* 519
you've just got it wrong. %$* 519
you've got your facts wrong. %$* 519
it's not wrong. %$* 520
the reality-- %$* 520
all right. %$* 13
we're going to move past on that one. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
what about billiards? %$* 13
sorry? %$* 520
billiards. %$* 19
oh, billiards. %$* 520
billiards, yes. %$* 520
christina, i want to put a question to you-- %$* 13
a question to you. %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
you talked about fields where men's, i would say, brawn is relevant; firefighters, the people who protect us, soldiers. %$* 13
you mentioned loggers. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
and they're kind of creating a world where they're saying it's-- %$* 13
it's more important now to be a blogger than to be a logger, that-- %$* 13
that there is-- %$* 13
that it's a facebook world, and the facebook world works better for women in many different ways, the social skills, et cetera. %$* 13
so i just wanted you to take on that notion that structurally we're changing so that the relevance of female characteristics to the economy, their economic value has become enhanced, while male so-called characteristics, brawn, for example-- %$* 13
i don't disagree with dan or hanna that there-- %$* 519
there's a female ascendancy which i find as exciting as-- %$* 519
both as a woman and grandmother of eliza. %$* 519
i like to see these opportunities for women and women moving into centers of power. %$* 519
but again, i insist that what they're doing is forging a partnership with men in running the world. %$* 519
they're not taking over. %$* 519
and-- %$* 519
and women are men are equal but different. %$* 519
and i think women are dazzling but in different ways. %$* 519
and so if i had been allowed to finish when i was up there instead of-- %$* 519
now-- %$* 13
now you-- %$* 13
only a woman was not allowed %$* 519
no, no, now you've got that moment, so i would take it. %$* 13
when i talked about the boys and girls with the doll house, and the boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof, even when-- %$* 519
when men and women get older, there's this complementarity. %$* 519
we still need the catapulters. %$* 519
we still need the nurturers. %$* 519
typically if a parent-- %$* 519
you know, a father and mother go to a park with a child and there's a jungle gym, the mother will say, "be careful." the father will say, "can you get to the top? %$* 519
" i think that we need both the nurturers and the catapulters and that the idea that we're going to have one over the other is unknown and can-- %$* 519
but the notion that the-- %$* 13
that so-called feminism qualities which would include what, hanna, become more relevant economically? %$* 13
you know, i'm so reluctant to enter this waw women are wonderful-- %$* 518
how do we say it-- %$* 518
debate? %$* 518
i mean, i don't know that women are particularly awesome, like when i enter this bloggers versus loggers conversation, this isn't a value judgment like loggers are losers, it's not the-- %$* 518
that's not the motto-- %$* 518
the loggers are going to be so relieved to hear you. %$* 13
loggers are not losers, we'll make the t-shirt after this debate, that's not what our side represents, it's just that they're an incredibly shrinking part of the american economy. %$* 518
it just is. %$* 518
it's really not a value judgment; it's like whatever it is that women have-- %$* 518
you know, people have called it so many things. %$* 518
they've called it grit. %$* 518
they've called it emotional intelligence. %$* 518
they've called it focus. %$* 518
nobody really knows what it is. %$* 518
some people try to say, like, oh, it's in the hardwiring of the brains of women. %$* 518
i'm not sure it's in the-- %$* 518
it might be that women have been behind all these years and now they're catching up the way immigrants do, it might be that, but it's just an economic fact that whatever it is %$* 518
i just have a question for hanna-- %$* 518
david, and then go-- %$* 13
well, if you look at all of the relevant stats, what you see is this is not the case, that when you look at concentrations of wealth, when you look at poverty in the united states and elsewhere, the deck has been stacked against women. %$* 521
that is not good. %$* 521
we need more gender equality. %$* 521
but in their world they have to twist what this debate means. %$* 521
and the fact is if men adjust to the work life realities, they are emasculated and feminized and therefore they lose. %$* 521
if they don't adapt to the new reality, men are emasculated and unnecessary and irrelevant and antiquated, and they lose. %$* 521
so i think women can become ceos, they can become stay at home moms, they can be considered masters of the new universe, and it is easy to structure in your mind the decline and fall of men when in your own mind when all the rules are stacked against your opponents, but here in the real world there is no truth to the facts. %$* 521
well, let me put the questions here aside then, in this-- %$* 13
we're talking about a process and we're talking about possibly being in the early stages of the process of male loss of dominance to women, so what is the endgame? %$* 13
thirty years from now if this process continues and accelerates, where are men as you imagine it, i mean, are we all wearing diapers in a closet somewhere or-- %$* 13
where are we in the picture if this continues? %$* 13
where did the diapers come from? %$* 518
infantilization. %$* 13
i get it, infantilization, well, i mean, you want to talk about the saddest part of this? %$* 518
when you guys say something like "logger," you make it sound like it's a very tiny minute percentage of the population. %$* 518
we're actually talking about 60 percent of the population that's not college educated, okay? %$* 518
so you keep mentioning bill gates. %$* 518
this is the american middle class, okay? %$* 518
you tap into the american middle class, i've done a lot of reporting on this issue, it is actually sad. %$* 518
i mean, you see that women are holding up these families, they're in community colleges, the men are struggling, and for some reason they're not getting the message that they have to go to school. %$* 518
so i think we can be in one of two different places. %$* 518
the men could start getting the message that they have to retool themselves, that the factories that their fathers worked for are not going to be there anymore and that they have to do something different, and then we'll end up in a situation that's closer to parity. %$* 518
or you could end up in a situation where it gets worse and worse and worse and the income-- %$* 518
you know, you have a sort of little upper class of people that these guys are talking about that consists of bill gates and maybe the people in this audience and not very many more people and everybody else is sort of struggling with the women holding the bag, it's called the last bag theory where the woman because she's raising the child is also going to school and making the money and the men are just sort of struggling and out of work. %$* 518
i would just add to that, the bigger problem i think for men is the unwillingness to take what have been viewed as classically female jobs, teachers, nurses, or healthcare professionals, et cetera, and that's the area where if you want to talk about how do we make this better, how do we end-- %$* 520
how do we reverse men being finished, which they are-- %$* 520
how do we reverse that? %$* 520
well, part of it has got to be that men are going to have to start accepting some of these jobs that have not been classically viewed as male. %$* 520
and i mean think about-- %$* 520
oh, may i say something that i-- %$* 519
think about the ben stiller movie where he plays a male nurse, right, and everyone's like well he's a male nurse, ha, ha. %$* 520
about six miles, seven miles from here is a high school called aviation high school, and it's got 2,000 students approximately, you go into that school, whereas at most schools, kids are detached and not paying attention, at aviation they are enthralled. %$* 519
you walk into that high school and you think all the kids are gone because it's so quiet. %$* 519
it's the quietest place in new york city. %$* 519
it's there the kids have to do academic courses, but they can spend half the day working on airplanes. %$* 519
they build mainframes and so forth. %$* 519
now it has one defect. %$* 519
it’s 87 percent male. %$* 519
and so the women’s lobby in washington has put it on a hit list. %$* 519
aviation high school has one of the best graduation rates. %$* 519
most of the kids going there are from-- %$* 519
their african american and hispanic kids living under the poverty line, and their chances of graduating are vastly higher than in any other school, very high college matriculation rate. %$* 519
that is a school that is working, but it now more likely to be investigated rather than replicated. %$* 519
people come to study this school from finland and ireland, but in the united states they’re more likely to be visited with a title 9 lawsuit because we’re not helping young men find jobs that they might find interesting and be suited for. %$* 519
the-- %$* 519
and i’m not talking about feminists. %$* 519
feminists are-- %$* 519
in my book, i talked about lots of different styles of feminism, and they’re not in favor of this. %$* 519
this is the women’s lobby in washington, which is carried away with a very hostile agenda and working against helping young men. %$* 519
that’s the problem. %$* 519
young men aren’t getting the help. %$* 519
but how does that not help their argument? %$* 13
yes, yes, because what christina is saying is proof-- %$* 518
the system is rigged against them. %$* 519
they haven’t been defeated. %$* 519
yes, because they’re finished. %$* 518
no, no, no. %$* 13
christina, finish-- %$* 13
let christina finish the point. %$* 13
no, to say that the system is rigged against them is not to say they’re finished. %$* 519
it’s saying they’re operating under a very severe handicap. %$* 519
and instead of using all of your creativity and energy to argue for this absurd proposition that men are finished, you should be doing something to alleviate the problem that’s leading to their struggle. %$* 519
well, acknowledging that this true would be the first step to helping them. %$* 518
it wouldn’t be that, you know, we would want them to be down-- %$* 518
look, if men are finished, we’re all finished, so let’s not go there. %$* 519
david zinczenko. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 521
you know, i was just going to add that it’s kind of silly too to say that men will need to learn how to adopt female characteristics to survive, whether it’s moving into jobs like interior decorating or health care providing or these counselors. %$* 521
i mean, i think that sigmund freud and nate berkus and dr. %$* 521
christian bernard would disagree with the assertion. %$* 521
the guys are moving too-- %$* 521
the men will be unemployed. %$* 520
i mean, it’s a simple choice. %$* 520
they will remain then unemployed. %$* 520
in a world where men do, say, fill the positions of school teachers and nurses such as they don’t now, in the vision that you’re saying would be the solution, would they still be dominant? %$* 13
well, look, the bottom line is dominance. %$* 520
how do we define that? %$* 520
i will tell you that health care will become a dominant industry. %$* 520
it’s becoming-- %$* 520
it already is-- %$* 520
but it’s becoming an even more dominant industry in our country and in our world. %$* 520
if men are simply saying “i’m not playing in that industry,” and women are saying “i’ll play in any industry, i don’t care what it is. %$* 520
i’m going to do what it takes to make it work,” then men are going to be at a distinct advantage and are going to remain finished. %$* 520
but this also gets to the heart of the problem. %$* 518
i mean, historically what’s happened is that women have operated pretty flexibly. %$* 518
they’ve gone in a very short period of time from not being able to work when they were married to not being able to work when they had little kids, to being able to work whenever they wanted in a vast number of professions. %$* 518
i can name a number of professions that have gone from entirely male to entirely female. %$* 518
and you can’t name any that have gone the other way around. %$* 518
why? %$* 518
because men operate in a narrower range at this point in time. %$* 518
that doesn’t mean that they always will, but at this point in time, they’re just not that flexible about their identities. %$* 518
okay. %$* 13
i want to come to the audience for questions shortly, but first i want to mention this, as i mentioned before. %$* 13
we’re very pleased to have slate as our media partner, and they’re streaming this debate-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and they’re live streaming this debate on their site, and we have a question from a william nitrous of new york city who i’m going to slightly paraphrase. %$* 13
he’s saying is this just a natural consequence-- %$* 13
i’m thinking what he means to say is this perception that perhaps men are finished, is it just a natural consequence of the assumption of superiority among men who, unlike females, didn’t have the pressure of needing a college degree to succeed? %$* 13
and the more interesting part of his question, he says, “does this apply outside of america? %$* 13
” so i want to put to both sides the cultural aspect of that question. %$* 13
to what degree are we talking about an american phenomenon here and to what degree is it more global? %$* 13
well, men are languishing academically throughout the world. %$* 519
in most countries in europe, far more women go to college-- %$* 519
i mean, more women go to college than men in iran, so it’s not only the united states. %$* 519
but what’s true is that the united states, we’re having a hard time finding ways to help young men. %$* 519
hanna rosin. %$* 13
men are languishing in all countries of the world. %$* 518
academically. %$* 519
academically, their language-- %$* 518
oh, no, no, not politically, no way. %$* 519
well, what-- %$* 518
you know, so here's an interesting statistic. %$* 518
so we always think-- %$* 518
male preference is something that comes up a lot. %$* 518
you know, preference for the first born son. %$* 518
one of the first things i did when i started this research was, on a lark and a tip, i went to go visit fertility clinics because, you know, we all understand that people prefer sons. %$* 518
and it turns out that, no, 75 percent of couples are actually requesting girls. %$* 518
so then i started to ask, well, is this true in these very patriarchal places like south korea, china and india? %$* 518
well, you look at the charts, and here's what happened. %$* 518
at some point, technology allowed them, you know, to easily choose a son. %$* 518
and then by the mid '90s, this plummeted. %$* 518
women started to go to school. %$* 518
women started to get jobs that they could never have before. %$* 518
and all these strict patriarchal structures started to break down. %$* 518
so you can see all over the world that different things are happening. %$* 518
i mean, china, for example, has a higher percentage of female ceos than the u.s.does. %$* 518
why? %$* 518
i think it's because childcare is easier. %$* 518
i think it's because families take care of children. %$* 518
there's all sorts of reasons why culturally that's true. %$* 518
chinese men finished? %$* 13
eventually. %$* 518
okay, let's go-- %$* 13
no, take it, christina, go ahead. %$* 13
i’m sorry, do you think that americans prefer to have female children? %$* 519
well, the difference is when you poll them and ask them what they want, they say we want a son. %$* 518
when they actually choose, they choose girls. %$* 518
it's amazing. %$* 521
this is the consistent theme again-- %$* 521
no, no. %$* 519
wrong, wrong, wrong, because she's overlooking something. %$* 519
when they actually choose, you're talking about women who go to fertility clinics. %$* 519
but that's the only place that keeps statistics. %$* 518
but-- %$* 519
but-- %$* 519
fertility clinics have to write down for the fda exactly what everybody else-- %$* 518
exactly what everybody does. %$* 518
and they keep the only reliable statistics. %$* 518
i mean, you can ask them, well, what do people want, and they'll say a certain thing. %$* 518
but-- %$* 518
but it's mostly-- %$* 519
it's not recorded. %$* 518
that's kind of-- %$* 519
that's led by women and slightly older women and the gallup poll kept records for-- %$* 519
since 1941, and you found a distinct preference for males. %$* 519
it hasn't changed since 1941. %$* 519
that's what people say. %$* 518
it's just not what they do. %$* 518
okay. %$* 13
but let's go to the audience for some questions now. %$* 13
what you do is, if you raise your hand, i'll find you. %$* 13
wait until-- %$* 13
please stand up. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
hold the microphone about a fist's distance away from your mouth so that the radio can hear you. %$* 13
and identify yourself. %$* 13
and if you're part of a relevant organization, you know what i mean by that, or news organization, please let us know. %$* 13
we'd just like to know that. %$* 13
and please make it a question that's terse, focused and on topic and that has a question mark at the end. %$* 13
you didn't have to sit down because i was making that long speech. %$* 13
hello. %$* 522
my name alicia bonner, and i am a graduate of a girl's high school, a women's college. %$* 522
and i earn a percent more than my fiancé. %$* 522
i am interested in a couple of the things that david and christina posed and hearing, dan and hanna, your responses. %$* 522
david, you spoke about financial inequality and how-- %$* 522
whatever, 92 percent of the world's resources are in the hands of men and x percent of the countries in the world are governed by men. %$* 522
christina, you seem to allude to the fact that anything that women are able to do, it's because men are there to earn money to fund it, which i think might be a little bit more problematic. %$* 522
but dan, you also mentioned that people on the whole-- %$* 522
could-- %$* 13
i'm getting there. %$* 522
focus it to a question shortly. %$* 13
the-- %$* 522
the-- %$* 522
they say that, um, you know, they say, yes, i like the way women sound, but i like male news casters better. %$* 522
how do we overcome this, yes in the middle class, you know, women-- %$* 522
women are holding the bag, as you say. %$* 522

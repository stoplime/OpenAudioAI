and once-- %$* 224
and once that animal is dead, do they still have a face? %$* 224
i mean, i would say that from an ethical standpoint, if somebody has lived and then they die, they're going to be eaten by somebody, either worms or bugs or another animal. %$* 224
so from my standpoint, ethically, you know, you've not taken the life of somebody with a face in that case. %$* 224
right in the middle there. %$* 13
did anybody come downstairs by any chance? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
and just wait for the mic to come up. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
this is a question for joel. %$* 19
so peter singer talked about speciesism, which is that-- %$* 19
as humans we practice this-- %$* 19
we put our species over other species, so i kind of just wanted talk about this from an ethical standpoint, regardless of what's-- %$* 19
what is our-- %$* 19
the historical process or health or any of that, how is speciesism any different than racism or sexism? %$* 19
as humans we fight for equality between humans all the time, and it's not about-- %$* 19
okay, i'm going to stop you, because you actually put the question right in the middle there. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
how is speciesism, which is the elevating of humans above other species, any different from racism? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 19
you said it. %$* 13
it was good. %$* 13
joel salatin. %$* 13
humans are part of the ecology. %$* 226
you know, we can't wake up one day and say, "i'm not going to participate in this, like a frog can't wake up on the edge of a pond one morning and say, "you know, i'm just not going to practice being a frog today." we are the caretaker species. %$* 226
humans are the only ones who can decide to procreate and not. %$* 226
animals don't, animals just do. %$* 226
you know, we tend to not eat each other. %$* 226
you know, if a chicken dies in the yard, why, you know, the others eat it right up. %$* 226
pigs the same way. %$* 226
i always tell my kindergarteners when they come out for farm tours in the pigpen, you know, "keep moving, guys. %$* 226
these are omnivores." you know. %$* 226
so i would simply say that instead of viewing what i would call our role as caretakers, as some sort of an elitist dominion idea, rather take it as, "heavy rests the head that wears the crown." therefore, we must exercise the greater responsibility in massaging our ecological umbilical, so that it actually attracts more solar energy in the biomass than it would in a static state. %$* 226
and that's exactly what pasture-based agriculture does. %$* 226
and, chris masterjohn, you wanted to add? %$* 13
joel and i essentially agree on this, so i'm not going to add too much, but i do think one of the things that the other side needs to articulate is a way to approach this harm reduction in a way that is economically and ecologically sustainable. %$* 225
so one of the things that i wonder-- %$* 225
and this could be taken as an open-ended question, definitely not a criticism-- %$* 225
one of the things that i wonder in reading your book, for example, gene, which i really love and i agree with you on, you know, 95 percent of it, is-- %$* 225
what i'm wondering is, if we are to say we should have a world without animal farming, what does that post animal farming world look like? %$* 225
for example, on your farm sanctuary, you sterilize the male mammals and make sure that you don't have any reproduction, so we're exercising some responsibility in minimizing harm to those animals by keeping the population size down. %$* 225
so when we shift to a post-animal farming world, do we move towards eradication of the domesticated, farm species, or do we have something like your sanctuary on a larger scale? %$* 225
okay. %$* 13
and if it's a larger scale, how is it economically sustained? %$* 225
gene baur. %$* 13
well, as i mentioned, there are some veganic farms now that are forming, and i think that's a very good model. %$* 224
i think it's also important to recognize that all species of farm animals, with the exception of the turkey, have been imported into the u.s.so cattle, for example, are now ranging where bison used to range. %$* 224
and so i think bison should be back there. %$* 224
and when we're growing plants and eating them directly, it requires far less acreage. %$* 224
so a lot of wild space could be left wild. %$* 224
and veganic farming is not necessarily no animals. %$* 224
there are wild animals. %$* 224
and you're interacting with animals but in a less harmful way. %$* 224
and that's what it's about, it’s doing as good as you can, causing as little harm as possible, and this is an evolving process. %$* 224
so i think there's some good signs, like-- %$* 224
i would disagree vehemently with the fact that it takes-- %$* 226
joel salatin. %$* 13
more area to grow this food this way. %$* 226
that, again, is coming straight out of the united nations, which i don’t trust as far as i can throw a bull by the tail, which isn’t very far. %$* 226
and these are studies paid for by the industrial food system-- %$* 226
wait a sec-- %$* 223
which is assuming-- %$* 226
when i go back to fargo and see acre after acre, as far as the eye can see, of corn and soy beans, and not one ear of that corn is going to be eaten by a human being-- %$* 223
i know, and-- %$* 226
all of the irrigation, all-- %$* 223
yeah, and you know what-- %$* 226
of the pesticides-- %$* 223
if all that land were growing prairie under intensive grazing management, it would be building soil, bringing springs back, replacing the aquifers, and growing far more nutrition per acre than corn and soy beans. %$* 226
as gene said, you could let it go-- %$* 223
you’re-- %$* 226
wild. %$* 223
assuming-- %$* 226
you’re assuming an inappropriate model. %$* 226
you’re looking at this saying, you know, most marriages are dysfunctional so i’m not going to participate in marriage. %$* 226
you know, we don’t solve problems by just walking away from the issue. %$* 226
we embrace it, we participate in it, and offer an alternative, and what i’m suggesting is that a biomimicked-- %$* 226
like the bison and the wolf – system. %$* 226
you know, the u.s. 500 years ago had more pounds of animals on the u.s. than are here today with all of our intensive agriculture. %$* 226
you know, you also speak about dominion-- %$* 224
that’s the truth. %$* 226
you know, we have dominion, as you mentioned, and we have-- %$* 224
we can play a role and either be kind or kill, you know? %$* 224
and we don’t need to kill. %$* 224
so-- %$* 224
and there are ways to grow food with plants without using animals. %$* 224
there’s veganic agriculture. %$* 224
it is coming. %$* 224
i need to say this. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: "don’t eat anything with a face." sir? %$* 13
thank you, guys. %$* 18
i’d like to frame this-- %$* 18
the health aspect of this debate. %$* 18
i think when you’re exploring-- %$* 18
can you keep the mic just a little bit closer? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
when you’re exploring optimal health, especially for the human genome, you have to look at anthropology and evolution. %$* 18
so, what role-- %$* 18
you guys touched upon this a little bit-- %$* 18
what role has animal protein played in the evolutionary success of homo sapiens? %$* 18
and what proof of that, if any, is left over in today’s modern humans? %$* 18
does any-- %$* 13
is that a question that anybody can answer without being wildly speculative? %$* 13
it’s a really interesting question, but i don’t know if we have-- %$* 13
go ahead, try it. %$* 13
try it, chris masterjohn. %$* 13
sure, i just want to make two really quick points. %$* 225
one: since you bring up-- %$* 225
since you bring up evolution and dr. %$* 225
barnard brought up primates, i just-- %$* 225
worth pointing out that chimpanzees according to dr. %$* 225
craig stamford, whose expertise is in that area-- %$* 225
eat 50 to 100 grams of meat per day. %$* 225
they hunt it and they use it as a commodity to trade it for food and sex, and also for their sustenance. %$* 225
but on evolution, i think, the lesson that evolution gives us is that there’s variation in the population. %$* 225
that variation changes over time. %$* 225
and so i’m not arguing that no one can be healthy on a vegan diet. %$* 225
i think gene proves that you can, but the point is the motion doesn’t say, “some people should not eat anything without a face.” it says, "don’t eat anything without a face,” and what we see is that there are genetic variations, like i mentioned in the beginning and many others, where not everyone can get the nutrients from plant foods as well as other people. %$* 225
some people will do well; some people won’t. %$* 225
that’s the lesson from evolution is that variation. %$* 225
okay. %$* 13
i was actually past-- %$* 13
sorry, sir. %$* 13
there was-- %$* 13
i was going for youth on this one. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
not that that’s a comment on you. %$* 13
i didn’t mean it that way. %$* 13
you’ll see what i mean. %$* 13
sir, can you tell us your name? %$* 13
hello, my name is max allendy and i have a question for the proposition side. %$* 18
the-- %$* 18
the motion is that you cannot eat-- %$* 18
nobody should eat anything with a face. %$* 18
why has factory farming been abandoned in this, because people still eat animals from factory farms, so why has that been abandoned? %$* 18
i’m going to pass on that question, because as i explained earlier, they all agree already that that’s not what they’re debating about, but thank you for your question. %$* 13
and sir, i’ll come down to you. %$* 13
my name is paul strauss meat is inexpensive, and i wonder what those in favor of the motion would say to those who cannot financially afford a meat- free diet? %$* 18
there’s actually a book out on-- %$* 224
gene bauer. %$* 13
eating vegan on four dollars a day. %$* 224
so eating vegan does not necessarily have to be very expensive. %$* 224
you can get beans and rice and-- %$* 224
you know, cooking also is something that we’ve lost sight of, and it’s another part of this process-- %$* 224
is preparing food. %$* 224
instead of just going to the store and getting a bag of potato chips, we can go get a sack of potatoes and work with that. %$* 224
and-- %$* 224
meat is very expensive. %$* 223
you have to raise the corn or whatever that you're feeding them, you have to irrigate it, do all these things. %$* 223
you feed it to the animal. %$* 223
the reason it's cheap at the store is that your tax dollars are going to subsidize the feed grains. %$* 223
and if those subsidies were ended suddenly, a burger-- %$* 223
the price of a burger would be through the roof. %$* 223
dried beans are-- %$* 223
cost pennies. %$* 223
okay. %$* 13
dried rice costs pennies. %$* 223
the reason-- %$* 13
the reason i want to-- %$* 13
the reason i want to move on is this side agrees with that argument, and it goes to the young man's question that we're not actually arguing the farm food system. %$* 13
ma'am right there. %$* 13
yeah, thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm victoria moran with unity online radio. %$* 19
my question is for dr. %$* 19
barnard. %$* 19
we know the research that was done about reversal of heart disease with the plant-based diet. %$* 19
has anything been done with an animal-based diet that shows that this number one killer in this country can be reversed or prevented? %$* 19
no. %$* 223
and in fact, when dean ornish did that work that i was describing, he had a control group that was allowed to eat meat, leaner cuts and that kind of thing. %$* 223
but by and large, they got worse, not better. %$* 223
and when we started seeing cases of reversal of diabetes, we couldn't do that with the meat-based diet. %$* 223
it just-- %$* 223
it just doesn't work at all. %$* 223
same with-- %$* 223
that's, of course, meat from a factory farm. %$* 226
no, no-- %$* 223
i just want to point that out. %$* 226
no, it doesn't matter. %$* 223
and the same with-- %$* 223
the study wasn't used pasture-based meat, was it? %$* 226
did it? %$* 226
no, it didn't! %$* 226
sir-- %$* 13
up until relatively recently-- %$* 223
let’s move on on this point. %$* 13
none of it was cafos. %$* 223
the reversal of erectile dysfunction that we've seen took a-- %$* 223
always occurred with vegan diets. %$* 223
it never occurred with a meat diet. %$* 223
okay. %$* 13
the answer to the woman's question was no. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
hello? %$* 18
my question is for the side arguing for the motion. %$* 18
you cite meat-eating as a major health hazard. %$* 18
but isn't it a question about balance and moderation? %$* 18
i mean, excessive amount of vitamins can be harmful to one's health as well. %$* 18
so isn't it about balance and moderation? %$* 18
well, the fact is that, you know, we can live without eating animals. %$* 224
and if you eat some animal products, it probably won't kill you, but it will kill the animal. %$* 224
and that's a key issue here. %$* 224
and, you know, even as a vegan, it's good to eat a variety of foods, like anybody. %$* 224
it's good to eat a variety, like beans, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and things like that. %$* 224
but, you know, with factory farming, to the point that was raised earlier, most people in this country who are eating animals are eating factory-farmed animals. %$* 224
so that should be, i think, a very strong point for voting for the measure-- %$* 224
why we should not eat anything with a face-- %$* 224
because almost everything with a face is coming from a factory farm. %$* 224
but, gene, how would it change things if the world were joel salatin's world everywhere, for you? %$* 13
there is still a relationship there with animals that is violent, and bloody, and it's unnecessary. %$* 224
we don't need to kill other animals to live. %$* 224
how many animals-- %$* 226
joel salatin. %$* 13
how many animals do you kill when you plant a tomato plant? %$* 226
plant a tomato? %$* 224
not that many. %$* 224
i mean-- %$* 224
a lot! %$* 226
it's pretty easy to plant. %$* 224
every-- %$* 226
every meter of soil-- %$* 226
every tablespoon of soil-- %$* 226
every tablespoon has a million living organisms that are communicating, reacting, exuding auxins, creating dna memories, having little, you know, mitochondria dances and, you know-- %$* 226
but they don't have a face. %$* 224
they're probably-- %$* 226
they don't have a face. %$* 224
you don't think they have a face. %$* 226
i don't think they do. %$* 224
i've not seen it. %$* 224
they don't have a nervous system. %$* 224
what constitutes a face-- %$* 226
they're very small. %$* 13
just because it's not a face like you, why is it no less important? %$* 226
only things that look like you are more important? %$* 226
you know, that's-- %$* 13
that's-- %$* 13
no, i think that it's good to be respectful to all. %$* 224
gene, i'm sorry that i interrupted you because i didn't mean to talk over you. %$* 13
i'd love to hear your answer to that question, so go for it. %$* 13
it's about being respectful to others. %$* 224
and there are lots of little bugs that live in the world-- %$* 224
and live in our bellies even-- %$* 224
that we interact with without an intentional harm being caused. %$* 224
when we're raising animals to kill them and eat them, there's an intention to kill them. %$* 224
and that is the difference between planting a tomato plant and going and slitting the throat of a chicken. %$* 224
there's a big difference. %$* 224
but, but-- %$* 225
chris masterjohn. %$* 13
five seconds. %$* 225
the millions and millions of animals that die during tillage for large-scale plant operations that are needed to-- %$* 225
that would be needed to provide calories and protein for human beings do have faces. %$* 225
i don't think we need those factory crop farms either. %$* 224
we're looking at small-scale, local-- %$* 224
i mean, we're kind of on the same page with that type of agriculture, and it could be plant-based, so it doesn't have to be these massive compounds where-- %$* 224
you like what he's doing with plants on his farm. %$* 13
you don't like what he's doing with animals, period. %$* 13
that's right, yeah. %$* 224
okay. %$* 13
well, you're assuming-- %$* 226
you're assuming-- %$* 226
joel salatin. %$* 13
that we can get the-- %$* 226
i mean, two-thirds-- %$* 226
two-thirds of the planet's surface is not arable. %$* 226
this is the-- %$* 226
what we call the nooks and crannies, the fringes, you know, where - - that's why herbivores are all over the planet, because they are not only pruning the biomass, but they are actually stimulating photosynthetic activity, and they are-- %$* 226
they're doing all these wonderful things. %$* 226
and they are, by and large, not living on areas that are corn and soybeans. %$* 226
you guys keep bringing up corn and soybeans, and i'm suggesting we don't need any of that either. %$* 226
it’s not about all of the wonderful things that they’re doing-- %$* 224
what we need is a balanced approach of plants and animals that mimics the kind of complex, relational interactions between plants and animals that the ecology illustrates. %$* 226
ma'am? %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
this is really interesting. %$* 19
my name is rosa matar i'm a swedish journalist over for two weeks to improve my english, and this is great. %$* 19
i just want to change focus a little bit because we're talking a lot about ethics and farm animals. %$* 19
and i come from an area in sweden where we hunt a lot of moose, deer, wild boar, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 19
i know that a lot of hunters, they think they're doing an ethical job keeping down the numbers of animals, because if they didn't, the animals would get sick-- %$* 19
just for time, i need you to zoom into your question. %$* 13
okay, sorry-- %$* 19
go out into the roads and get, you know, like road killed and all. %$* 19
how do you look upon that? %$* 19
is it more justified to kill wild animals, like moose-- %$* 19
through hunting, through hunting. %$* 13
through hunting, yes. %$* 19
i’ll put it to both sides. %$* 13
gene baur. %$* 13
i think it's really all about the relationship, you know. %$* 224
and in this country, you know, the deer populations are actually managed so we can have people go out and kill them. %$* 224
so the hunting is actually used as an excuse to go kill. %$* 224
we've removed all the natural predators. %$* 224
so i'm in favor of a more natural ecosystem and then for human beings to interact in a humane way and to not cause harm if we don't need to. %$* 224
and hunting is certainly harm. %$* 224
other side like to respond to that? %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 226
chris masterjohn. %$* 13
i guess, isn't this a matter of the directness of our complicity rather than our complicity? %$* 225
so if we move towards a world that has more wild animals with more predators, where those animals are not-- %$* 225
i know there are issues with humane slaughtering now-- %$* 225
but those animals will suffer the same fate of factory-farmed animals, where they can get ripped apart where they're still alive. %$* 225
you still have those animals dying. %$* 225
the slaughter is less humane than it could be with humans. %$* 225
so aren't we just removing our directness in the complicity rather than our actual complicity? %$* 225
pre-14-- %$* 226
one thing i have to do-- %$* 224
pre-1491, there were 100 million bison in the u.s.and 1 million wolves. %$* 226
that doesn't count all the other herbivores, beavers, and birds. %$* 226
let's let gene baur answer that question. %$* 13
you know, you can't control others. %$* 224
you can only control yourself. %$* 224
and other animals, you know, have the world they live in. %$* 224
and, you know, we talk about dominion and hubris and human arrogance, in a sense. %$* 224
and, you know, we're part of this planet. %$* 224
and saying that we need to go there to save those animals is, i don't think, a very good way to look at it. %$* 224
we interact with other animals. %$* 224
it's about the relationship. %$* 224
what is that relationship going to look like? %$* 224
and if we can live with other animals without killing them, without exploiting them, without putting them in small cages, and, you know – ‘cause once we start doing that, it tends to go pretty badly. %$* 224
and i've been to your farm, joel, and, you know, i really appreciate that it's open, and people are allowed to visit, but some of the conditions were pretty bad. %$* 224
all right. %$* 13
let's not go in that direction either. %$* 13
let it go. %$* 13
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are: we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater, in turn. %$* 13
these closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the arguments began. %$* 13
right after this, your second vote, and that will decide the winner for us. %$* 13
on to round 3: closing statements. %$* 13
here to summarize his position against our motion, "don’t eat anything with a face," he's against this motion, chris masterjohn, a nutritional sciences researcher and author of the blog the daily lipid. %$* 13
large-scale, epidemiological evidence that has been recently published shows that vegetarians who shop at health food stores, or otherwise health conscious, have no benefit over meat-eaters who shop at health food stores, or otherwise health conscious. %$* 225
and this tells us nothing about causation because it's a correlation. %$* 225
dean ornish showed that a program limiting sugar, sugar derivatives, corn syrup, white flour, fat, alcohol, smoking cessation, peer-support exercise and stress management, through meditation, stretching, and visualization, along with the exclusion of meat, reverses heart disease, perhaps, but hasn't shown that reversing meat, specifically, does. %$* 225
what this means is that science is very complex, so i'd like to offer a way to synthesize the information in a way that embraces the uncertainty as a source not of frustration and confusion but of empowerment. %$* 225
we should take as our baseline the spectrum of traditional diets associated with population-wide freedom from degenerative disease, where even the most vulnerable members of the population were protected. %$* 225
these diets all lacked refined foods and all contain nutrient-dense animal foods regardless of whether they ate a little or a lot. %$* 225
we should build on this with our scientific understanding of physiology which shows that animal foods provide nutrition and that dietary needs vary from one individual to another, and it may, in the same individual, vary from one period of life to another. %$* 225
we should-- %$* 225
this emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning our dietary approach to achieve what makes us personally as individuals healthiest. %$* 225
the motion tonight fails to prevent the death and suffering of animals in an ecologically and economically sustainable way. %$* 225
it's inconsistent with traditional diets not validated by modern science and reduces our ability to individualize our diets as needed. %$* 225
because its particular form of absolutism is so lopsided, it's even more harmful than the converse proposition to always eat something with a face. %$* 225
so i urge you to vote against it. %$* 225
thank you, chris masterjohn. %$* 13
and that is our motion, “don’t eat anything with a face.” and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, neal barnard, a clinical researcher and president of the physicians committee for responsible medicine. %$* 13
if your teenage son or daughter were to say to you, "mom, dad, i made up my mind. %$* 223
i'm going to eat my fruits and vegetables, and i'm going to have veggie burgers and things, but i'm just not going to eat anything with a face. %$* 223
i-- %$* 223
don't worry, i know how to do it. %$* 223
i know where to get my protein." if you then looked at the numbers and you realized that your child's risk of becoming obese or having a heart attack or developing cancer just plummeted, you would be thrilled. %$* 223
and if you were part of an insurance group where your costs were dependent on the health of that group, and if every other member said, "i'm not going to eat any meat," you'd be thrilled, because you're going to save a huge amount of money. %$* 223
the world's strongest man is patrik baboumian, who recently lifted 1,210 pounds on an entirely plant-based diet. %$* 223
the world's greatest ultra long distance runner is scott jurek. %$* 223
he runs 100 miles, 125 miles, 150 miles at one stretch faster than any living human being on an entirely plant-based diet. %$* 223
this past monday, the world memory championships were held in london. %$* 223
and contestants there can memorize a pack of cards in 30 seconds. %$* 223
and the winner was 25-year-old jonas von essen, of sweden, who-- %$* 223
was powered by an entirely plant-based diet. %$* 223
and, arguably the world's greatest brain, albert einstein wrote some words i want to share with you, "in my view, that the - - “-- %$* 223
it's my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind." and einstein continued, "so i am living without fats, without meat, without fish. %$* 223
and i'm feeling quite well this way. %$* 223
it always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore." a generation ago we tackled tobacco, and while everybody is free to smoke we just know that we're not going to do it. %$* 223
and today the issue is food-- %$* 223
for yourself, but most importantly for that animal who is your child or your neighbor's child. %$* 223
this resolution makes the most health sense, “don’t eat anything with a face.” %$* 223
thank you, neal barnard. %$* 13
again, that is our motion, “don’t eat anything with a face.” and here to summarize his position against this motion, joel salatin. %$* 13
he's a third- generation alternative farmer in virginia's shenandoah valley. %$* 13
you know, it's fascinating how you can just kind of trade study for study for study. %$* 226
and that's i think what's happened tonight. %$* 226
the fact is that science is subjective based on the prejudice of the researchers. %$* 226
they set up the experiments this way. %$* 226
and so you got to look at who finances them, where the money goes, and decide what to do. %$* 226
that's how monsanto got the, you know, gmos through. %$* 226
they used geriatric rats. %$* 226
when the same experiments were repeated in scotland with juvenile rats, all sorts of problems came up with gmos. %$* 226
so i kind of, i kind of go philosophical on this, you know. %$* 226
we can trade dead bodies and thin people and heart attacks all night, alright? %$* 226
so, i find it fascinating that gene says that jesus and muhammad could not show compassion. %$* 226
that's a powerful statement. %$* 226
neither one of them was vegans. %$* 226
they both advocated eating meat. %$* 226
and if there certainly was an ethical dimension to this, one of those prophets should have said something about it, don't you think? %$* 226
the anatomy of a human is predacious. %$* 226
our eyes are in the front of our heads. %$* 226
we have incisors. %$* 226
we're not built like prey. %$* 226
we are predators. %$* 226
and remember, there are no exceptions in this topic. %$* 226
so remember my initial point about the poor and why 60 percent of the world keeps livestock: because it’s portable wealth for the landed poor, and it’s real-time nutrition for those who can’t afford the high-fertility soil necessary to grow kale, and it’s not subject to vermin infestation like grain is, or like spoilage when you don’t have refrigeration. %$* 226
this motion, when you vote for the motion, is an unbelievable disrespect and dishonor of this world’s poor people who rely on real-time livestock for nutrition, and survival. %$* 226
so-- %$* 226
joel salatin, i’m sorry. %$* 13
you’re time is up. %$* 13
yep. %$* 226
leave and legacy-- %$* 226
thank you very much. %$* 13
and vote against the motion. %$* 226
and our motion is, "don’t eat anything with a face,” and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, gene bauer, the president and co-founder of farm sanctuary. %$* 13
voting for this measure is voting for sustainability. %$* 224
it requires far fewer resourses to grow plant foods as opposed to animal foods. %$* 224
it is the way people with few resources have eaten for thousands and thousands of years. %$* 224
our massive, animal-consuming lifestyle is fairly recent. %$* 224
we all agree that factory farming is bad, and we need to look at that because most of the animals who are killed and eaten today come from factory farms. %$* 224
if we think that that is unacceptable, we need to vote yes on the motion not to eat anything with a face. %$* 224
and going more philosophically, this is ultimately about our relationship with other animals. %$* 224
historically, humans have eaten other animals, and as i mentioned, in tough times people have eaten other people. %$* 224
we’ve done a lot of very bad things, but when we have choices, when we have options, when we can live in a way that does not cause harm, why wouldn’t we? %$* 224
the word “humane” and “slaughter” don’t go very well together, and when you try to rationalize that these animals are there to be killed and eaten by us, many other bad things do happen. %$* 224
and i have been to a number of factory farms, i have been to a number of small farms, where animals are put in small areas, where they’re put in cages even, at these so-called “humane” farms. %$* 224
when the animals are seen as commodities, and as edibles, they are not treated with respect. %$* 224
that is bad for the animals, and i would also suggest it is bad for us. %$* 224
i’m not saying everybody who eats animals is a mean person. %$* 224
you know, we all grow, we all learn, we evolve, and when we learn, we can do better, and that’s what it’s ultimately about. %$* 224
it’s about intent. %$* 224
and if you vote yes on this, that doesn’t mean you’ve got to be vegan tomorrow. %$* 224
this is a principle that we should not eat anything with a face. %$* 224
these are other animals. %$* 224
they have feelings just like our cats and dogs. %$* 224
they deserve to be treated with respect. %$* 224
please vote yes on the motion. %$* 224
thank you, gene bauer. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements, and now it’s time to learn which side has argued the best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat to register your vote on this motion after having heard all of these arguments. %$* 13
the motion is, "don’t eat anything with a face." if you now embrace this motion, as stated, push number one-- %$* 13
if you’re with this side, push number one; if you’re against it, with this side, push number two; and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we will have the results in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
before that happens, one thing i’d like to do, first of all, is to ask all of you to show your appreciation for four debaters who took this into really interesting areas. %$* 13
and, as an audience, asking audience questions, they were all really good tonight, and to the young man whose question i passed on, i just want to say, i apologize that i couldn’t take it, but for you to get up took a lot of guts. %$* 13
so congratulations to you. %$* 13
and we always like it when former debaters come back to sit in the audience, and we have sheldon krimsky here, who was here last year arguing-- %$* 13
he argued one of our toughest ethical debates, where the motion was, “prohibit genetically engineered children,” and i bet sheldon fixed it-- %$* 13
a bow. %$* 13
i bet it’s a lot easier to-- %$* 13
a lot easier to watch from there than to be up here. %$* 13
we’d love it if you tweeted about this debate tonight. %$* 13
remember our twitter handle is @iq2us, and our hash tag is #vegdebate.our next season starts back here in january. %$* 13
we're starting on the 15th. %$* 13
the motion that night will be, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." for the motion, dr. %$* 13
scott gottlieb-- %$* 13
he's a practicing physician and former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
his partner is megan mcardle, a columnist for bloomberg view, who writes on economic business and public policy. %$* 13
opposing them, and supporting the rescuability of obamacare, jonathan chait-- %$* 13
he's a commentator and writer for new york magazine-- %$* 13
and dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow. %$* 13
he is a professor of family medicine at georgetown and a former assistant surgeon general. %$* 13
the rest of our spring topics, going from january through may, will be-- %$* 13
we're going to cover labor unions, affirmative action on campus, targeted killing of u.s.citizens, russia, moocs (massive online open courses), where we're looking at whether online is the future of universities, millennials, and death. %$* 13
tickets for all of our spring debates are on sale now through our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and for those who can't join our live audience, there are a lot of other ways to catch the debates. %$* 13
you can watch the live stream, as i mentioned a few times tonight, on iq2us.org or on fora.tv. %$* 13
and you can listen to the debates on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
you can check your local listings for air dates and times. %$* 13
and make sure to visit our website for up-to-date information. %$* 13
stay in touch with us on twitter and facebook, because we welcome your feedback. %$* 13
and we do take ideas. %$* 13
we put debates on stage that have come from audience members. %$* 13
and one other thing, i only wanted to mention this after the vote was in because i wasn't sure how, if at all, it might sway your vote. %$* 13
but joel salatin's neck tie, it looks like just polka dots to you. %$* 13
those are all little piggies. %$* 13
each one of those. %$* 13
but it can't change anything now. %$* 13
because the results are all in. %$* 13
you have now heard the arguments. %$* 13
you have voted twice, once before the arguments and once after. %$* 13
and as we count this, the team that has changed the most minds in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so here are the results: the motion, "don’t eat anything with a face." before the debate, in polling the live audience, 24 percent agreed with this motion, 51 percent were against, and 25 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you have to have beaten-- %$* 13
you have to have moved your number in percentage point terms by the most in order to win. %$* 13
so onto the second vote, on "don’t eat anything with a face.” the team arguing for the motion: their second vote was 45 percent. %$* 13
they went from 24 percent to 45 percent. %$* 13
that means they picked up 21 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see, the team against the motion, their first vote was 51 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 43 percent. %$* 13
they lost 8 percentage points. %$* 13
that means the team arguing for the motion, "don’t eat anything with a face" is our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

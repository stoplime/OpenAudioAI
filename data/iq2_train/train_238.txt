and that’s why you can't make a permanent decision and stamp it in stone as those speaking against the motion would basically like to do. %$* 615
they’d like to say, this, the sum cost in this war is so high that nothing that could conceivably happen would be worth it, therefore the war was a failure, and lost. %$* 615
and bush is a word that i can't use on the air. %$* 615
and the problem is the story doesn't end there. %$* 615
the question is, what will happen in the years to come, and we don’t know. %$* 615
right now it appears to me that the trends are positive to have quite a profound impact on the middle east. %$* 615
and what impresses me is that it is iraqis who are engaged in this process actively, who are saying so. %$* 615
and this isn’t—i’m not talking about ahmed chalabi and other folks like that who’ve been discredited. %$* 615
i’m talking about people who are actually engaged day to day, in running their country. %$* 615
this is what they’re saying. %$* 615
if that is in fact the case and i think that it is, then, not only will those deaths not have been in vain as—as no military deaths are, but they will have served a tremendous interest of the united states of america and the world. %$* 615
gentlemen— question from the audience. %$* 13
i’m ed thompson with the ayn rand institute. %$* 617
i find sir malcolm’s assertion, that, because they are iraqis or arabs, that there will be violence, i find that a racist statement. %$* 617
i feel compelled to point out— i’ll get to that. %$* 617
i feel compelled to point out that it was the iraqi troops that went into bosnia, to clean up the mess that was left behind by the british troops. %$* 617
now %$* 617
the question that i have is how the opposition can deny or ignore the evidence of the proponents that we’re winning the war %$* 617
and state that, iraq will fall into disarray when the, when the americans leave, when %$* 617
mr. %$* 617
kagan states, that iraq will be a—it’ll be a watershed situation, that iraq will be a rival to saudi arabia because it’s a democracy. %$* 617
now, the question really is, what makes you think that, sir rifkind, what makes you think that iraq will fall into violence, as opposed to becoming a civilized country, like some of the other middle eastern states such as the us—uae, kuwait, and— %$* 617
i’m gonna cut you off because i think the question is clear. %$* 13
sir malcolm, i think the question if i can— %$* 13
i think you clearly misunderstood what i said and that may have been my fault and i’m sorry if you did. %$* 616
but at no time do i suggest that the iraqis as a people, as a culture are any more prone to violence than anybody of any ethnic background. %$* 616
what i did say, is that if you go into somebody else’s country, who has not attacked you, if you remove their government and if you destroy their political system, then you create a political vacuum. %$* 616
and in the circumstances of iraq, where rightly or wrongly, the sunni minority had had power, not just under saddam hussein, for a hundred, 200 years, and the shia majority suddenly see an opportunity to assert power, and the sunni seeing that they’re losing it resist that, you get effectively a civil war. %$* 616
and when you, as a result of having created this political vacuum, you give people like al-qaeda an opportunity to get in on the act, encouraging separatist violence, helping mosques being blown up in order to get people to commit acts of revenge in return, then you get all the terrible trauma, of what has happened in iraq. %$* 616
now i do not say that that is the direct responsibility of the american or the british governments, of course, they were not responsible for violence committed by al-qaeda, or by sunni or by shia. %$* 616
what i do say, is that that explosion of violence which has led to tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of terrible deaths, simply would not have happened, if the foolish decision to go to war had not been taken in the first place. %$* 616
sir malcolm, fred kagan— %$* 13
and so ultimately, we have that responsibility— %$* 616
fred kagan would like to jump in on that. %$* 13
i’d just like to make a point that has been lost in this discussion so far which is to begin with, there was a small al-qaeda presence in iraq before 2003, that’s an established fact. %$* 615
abu musab al-zarkawi was already in baghdad in 2002.i do not regard that as sufficient justification for invading iraq, i don’t think that. %$* 615
i’m not trying to make that case, i am stating a fact that there was an al-qaeda presence in iraq before we invaded. %$* 615
al-qaeda then took advantage of our failed strategy and our inappropriate methods and the variety of the mistakes that have been highlighted here, repeatedly, to seize control in anbar province, and areas of ninewa and particularly salahaddin province and areas of diyala and of course baghdad. %$* 615
what has been lost, is that, iraq is now the first place in the muslim world, where a sunni arab population, that had embraced and supported al-qaeda and provided fighters to its ranks, rose up against al-qaeda, joined with the military of the united states of america, fought tooth and nail to defeat the insurgents, threw them out of their country, and now you can hardly find an iraqi anywhere, who will say anything other than, al-qaeda are foreigners, they’re evil, they’re bad people and we will never let them back into our country. %$* 615
if you want to talk about effects in the war on terror, this is an unintended consequence %$* 615
let us say. %$* 615
it’s not as though there was an al- qaeda group in iraq that was large that we went in and defeated. %$* 615
however. %$* 615
if you watch what the jihadis say, if you watch the al- qaeda websites, nothing that has happened in the past seven years has distressed them more, with the exception of losing afghanistan initially— nothing has distressed them more than the awakening movement in iraq which they see as a mortal threat to the success of their ideological movement within the muslim world, and i think it’s very important to recognize that. %$* 615
thank you, fred— that was fred kagan, speaking for the motion. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, this is intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating, on america’s shores, we have four panelists on the program. %$* 13
two for, and two against the proposition, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” we are in our mix-it-up section in which we are taking questions from the audience, and i understand that we have an iraqi war vet who’s had his hand up for some time far in the back. %$* 13
sir, the mic is yours. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 618
my name’s jose vasquez, i’m a former staff sergeant, us army, i’m also a member—thank you. %$* 618
i’m also a member of iraq veterans against the war, my organization just recently published a series of testimonies called winter soldiers: iraq and afghanistan—eyewitness accounts of the occupations. %$* 618
over 150 members came forward to testify about things like— %$* 618
i need a question from you— %$* 13
—indiscriminate fire, into civilian occupied areas, ongoing torture, and corporate pillaging, my question for the folks that are for the motion is, given the systemic nature of these types of atrocities, do the panelists for the motion support a military victory at the price of moral and legal failure. %$* 618
is that victory at all. %$* 618
thank you. %$* 618
the—the factual basis of atrocities which exist in all wars, as it pertains to iraq, are far lower than any experience that the united states or western countries have normally had in wars in the past, and, to— i’m not suggesting they don’t exist, they exist. %$* 614
the difference is this also. %$* 614
is that, when the united states and its western allies, when their soldiers do wrong and harm others, there’s accountability for that. %$* 614
those soldiers and those leaders that are involved in that, are brought very quickly into a judicial process for accountability, that’s what a democracy does, and that’s what we have always been doing throughout our history, we’re not perfect in this. %$* 614
but it’s certainly, that is, the realistic issue here is the fact that they have been committed, but they are much lower than our experience has been on a per-capita basis, and always, there’s been accountability for that horror when it’s inflicted and when the chain of command is, is made aware of it— %$* 614
all right, general— %$* 13
and it ignores the overwhelming good and sacrifice and compassion, that we have seen our soldiers display on a day-to- day basis, on the one, one moment %$* 614
putting their life right on the line for iraqi families and iraqi citizenry, and then in the next moment, having tremendous compassion, and helping and assisting them with— %$* 614
general, with due respect— %$* 13
—the values of the country— %$* 614
—to your passion on that and to the question itself, it’s actually off our point of whether the us is winning the war in iraq and i would like to get back to that point with a question from the woman— %$* 13
hello, i’m dina temple-raston with national public radio. %$* 619
and i wanted to quibble a little bit with your version of events in basra. %$* 619
muqtada al-sadr’s forces there weren’t defeated. %$* 619
i was there for npr reporting at the time. %$* 619
and the mahdi army just disappeared. %$* 619
al-sadr told them to disappear, and they left with their guns. %$* 619
and we really haven’t seen much of them since. %$* 619
on the same point, similarly, there are enormous issues right now surrounding the sons of iraq. %$* 619
and the ability of the iraqi government to fold them into the iraqi army, and pay them as the americans have. %$* 619
so— %$* 619
and your question is— %$* 13
my question is %$* 619
how can you say america is winning the war in iraq when we have these two enormous problems that have been left unresolved, muqtada al-sadr, and the awakening commission. %$* 619
and, how do you suggest we tackle these problems going forward. %$* 619
and aren’t they just waiting us out? %$* 619
fred kagan, for the motion. %$* 13
with due respect, i don’t denigrate what you saw when you were there, but i have also spoken with many people who participated in that operation, shortly after it occurred. %$* 615
and they did not simply disappear. %$* 615
many of them were killed. %$* 615
and, many of them particularly in sadr city where they fought harder, were killed. %$* 615
and many of their top leaders were killed, which is one of the key reasons why they broke. %$* 615
and if you look at what is actually going on within the shia community now, and you look at what sadr has done, and you ask the question, are there sadrist networks that remain in iraq, the answer is, of course there are. %$* 615
then the next question, will they take sadr’s order, if sadr tells them to rise up again and do this or do that or the other thing, and what we have seen repeatedly is, the answer is, yes and no, but increasingly more no than yes. %$* 615
for the excellent reason that they have come to fear, not only the american military, but also the iraqi army. %$* 615
and, there was an interesting and very poignant moment, when some of those— actually i think it was probably iranian special groups rather than sadrists who did this—spray- painted on a bridge, across the border into iran, “we’ll be back.” and the iraqi army, iraqi army soldiers spray-painted right under it, “we’ll be waiting.” and that message has gone out. %$* 615
and so i’m sorry, it simply is not the case that sadr is just waiting us out, sadr’s son has said for the moment it may rise again, he’s a young man, we’ll see. %$* 615
what will not happen, is that you will have an uprising on the scale of 2004, 2005 or even 2006 when the sadrists were poised to take control of the country. %$* 615
sir malcolm, i— %$* 13
that’s not %$* 615
—i hear in that response an answer to your point earlier, well, maybe they’re just lying low, and insurgents rise and fall again, what about that, fred kagan is saying he thinks this is permanent, it’s gonna last, or very likely to last. %$* 13
i think it is entirely possible that the insurgency will permanently, slowly, come to an end. %$* 616
we’re not there yet, there is a lot of truth in the argument that muqtada al-sadr is simply biding his time. %$* 616
but he’s weaker than he was in the past. %$* 616
and if that is happening, if the insurgency is being brought under control—i would welcome that, any reasonable person would welcome that. %$* 616
but that doesn’t mean we’ve won the war. %$* 616
to win the war, or to be even winning the war, means we are approaching the stage where we can say this whole operation was worthwhile. %$* 616
the last five years was right and justified. %$* 616
that’s a very different question. %$* 616
may i make a brief comment about this? %$* 555
charles ferguson. %$* 13
look, it is possible that iraq will stabilize and the insurgency will, fall away gradually. %$* 555
however, this idea, this portrait of an incipient paradise that mr. %$* 555
kagan paints is unfortunately just not right. %$* 555
there are enormous tensions still inside iraq. %$* 555
there’s a three-way, at least a three-way— %$* 555
charles, with respect, i haven’t heard as the moderator fred kagan promise an incipient paradise— %$* 13
fair enough— %$* 555
right— %$* 13
—excuse me. %$* 555
i, fair enough, i retract that and i apologize to mr. %$* 555
kagan. %$* 555
but— %$* 555
or even anything close. %$* 13
also fair enough. %$* 555
but the idea that we are reaching and it’s within sight that we have a stable situation in iraq, simply is not true. %$* 555
there are enormous tensions over kirkuk, which could erupt into military conflict. %$* 555
that issue remains entirely unresolved. %$* 555
there’s at least a three-way, possibly a four- or five- or six-way, fight among various shiite groups for control of the south including basra. %$* 555
it is true that the sadrist movement remains fairly strong. %$* 555
the integration of the roughly hundred thousand sunni awakening council concerned citizens, uh, members, into the security forces and into iraqi society remains extremely unclear and uncertain and is largely being forced by the americans onto an extremely unwilling central government. %$* 555
so, it’s not—this country remains very fragile, and none of the proposals for withdrawing american troops have envisioned anything more than a withdrawal of roughly one-third of total us forces. %$* 555
withdrawing all us combat forces would withdraw only about 25 percent of total us forces in the area, not even counting the private military contractors. %$* 555
charles ferguson, thank you, we’re gonna go to another question in the rear? %$* 13
my name is ross sandler, i’d like to look to the future a bit, and ask both groups %$* 620
what events or circumstances or milestones or trends would cause you to moderate your view. %$* 620
i love that question. %$* 13
and it’s— and it’s what i asked before of charles, what would be victory, when—when would you say, well i might’ve been wrong, it’s working out. %$* 13
or the reverse, i might’ve been wrong, it’s not working out, jack keane. %$* 13
well, i’ll start it off. %$* 614
one is the provincial election law itself, which was the most crucial in our view, because it’s decentralized government and it’s empowering people at local levels, and there’s a lot of that there right now, but now it’ll be formalized and it’ll be a structure for them to vote for, and a structure for them to receive budget money from as well. %$* 614
that’s number one. %$* 614
certainly, there’s issues that surround the kurds. %$* 614
there’s article 140, i don’t wanna get into the details of it because we don’t have enough time. %$* 614
and that is of a concern for us in the future, we’re not—fred and i are not suggesting that there are not challenges ahead in iraq—of course there are. %$* 614
but the good news that we are bringing to you is that there’s been significant progress here, and we’ve moved into another phase. %$* 614
we’re moving out of a security phase into a political phase, where people are using the political process to address their grievances as opposed to armed violence, and that’s what we have to be hopeful for. %$* 614
i don’t think that could be turned back easily. %$* 614
and certainly, the second thing that would concern me are the iranians themselves, they are up to huge mischief here. %$* 614
this is of significant strategic interest, their number-one strategic interest in iraq, is the removal of the united states. %$* 614
they want a weak central government in iraq, so that they can have influence over that government. %$* 614
and that is their strategic interest when it pertains to iraq, not the region itself. %$* 614
brigadier general suleimani, who was the quds force commander, who engineered the operation in iraq, in southern iraq on behalf of the iranians, he is the quds force commander, who defeated the israelis in southern lebanon. %$* 614
he has been in his position over 10 years. %$* 614
he is intelligent, experienced, and ruthless. %$* 614
he works for one person, and one person only, and that’s the supreme leader of iraq. %$* 614
of iran, excuse me. %$* 614
despite the major setback that we have had in the south, for that leader and for his forces, his proxy forces, he is still in command. %$* 614
sir malcolm— %$* 13
which tells me, that they have not given up on their strategic objective. %$* 9
we believe because of the anti-iranian attitude that is in the south among its people, and the—and their commitment to move to a greater iraq, aligned with the united states, that we will be okay. %$* 9
but if you ask me, am i concerned about it, i am, because of their determination. %$* 9
could it change things in iraq? %$* 9
it could. %$* 9
sir malcolm. %$* 13
general keane rightly says that the iranians have a strategic objective of wanting to see a very weak iraqi government, in order that iran will be the unrivaled power in the region. %$* 616
he conveniently forgets or ignores, that iraq did have a very strutting central government, not just under saddam hussein, but for the last 50 years under successive iraqi governments. %$* 616
it is because of the war, that he is supporting, that iraq as a strong centralized state has been destroyed, and that iraq today has exactly that weak, decentralized government, with a kurdish autonomous region in the north, with the shia and sunni constantly battling for influence and power, and with the central government having little real power, that is exactly what the iranians wanted to achieve, and it is american and british policy that has helped them achieve it. %$* 616
sir malcolm, are you saying that the war makes victory impossible? %$* 13
i am saying that the only way in which you can test whether victory has been achieved, is not to simply look at whether the insurgency is going up or going down, as if the—the war is simply about the insurgency. %$* 616
the war is about the invasion of iraq, the destruction of a regime, the creation of a political vacuum, and whether the overall effects of that strategy, pursued by america, by britain, and by the coalition, whether that has been net plus for the iraqis and for the region, or whether it has been a net minus. %$* 616
fred kagan. %$* 13
i’d like to take a minute to address one of the historical myths that seems to me to be embedded in this backward-looking definition of whether we’re winning or not. %$* 615
which is, how exactly was iraq doing in the 1990s after the liberation of kuwait which was generally agreed to be a good war, led to an international- sanctions regime, led to an oil-for-food program that became incredibly corrupt, not only on the iraqi side which was to be expected, with saddam hussein, but also on the un side unfortunately. %$* 615
which created significant problems, and i’ve heard iraqis explain to me, even now, some of the problems that are persistent in the corruption that you see in iraq date back to structures and practices that were established under the oil-for- food program. %$* 615
iraq was not exactly a wonderful buffer against iran in the 1990s when we, the united states and great britain were compelled to maintain forces which looked like forever, in that circumstance, conducting overflight and periodically bombing iraq. %$* 615
and there was no end in sight to that particularly either, now, if you think that this war is going to drag on and be miserable for decades obviously it was preferable to do what we were doing in the ‘90s than that. %$* 615
if you think that there’s a prospect as i do of actual success, then, this is something that can end, in a way that that wasn’t, but the notion that we were the ones who destroyed in 2003 a very effective system of dual containment i think is problematic. %$* 615
but i’d like to answer the question that was asked, because it’s an excellent question. %$* 615
and i think as an analytical matter, it’s something that’s very important to put on the table, and i’m willing to put this on the table, and i’m willing to be judged against this and you can throw this up to me two or three years hence, and we can talk about whether it worked out. %$* 615
what would make me change my mind about the analysis? %$* 615
to begin with, i already changed my mind. %$* 615
as i told you, i had been fairly pessimistic going into the passage of the provincial election law. %$* 615
i’ve changed my view as a result of that. %$* 615
if the provincial elections are not held, are not seen to be legitimate, or badly marred by violence, that will be a very negative indicator, and it will make me revise my view. %$* 615
if the subsequent council of representative elections are not held, are not seen to be legitimate, or badly marred by violence, that will be a very important negative indicator. %$* 615
if the sunni arab community in iraq decides that it is not going to participate in the political process in these elections, in subsequent elections, or in any way thereafter, that will be an extremely negative indicator, and we’ll have to revise our view. %$* 615
if the iranian backed and controlled special groups are able to reestablish themselves in a coherent fashion through the country and conduct the sort of coherent, widespread campaigns that they were able to conduct before the surge, that will be a negative indicator. %$* 615
if a sunni-arab insurgency reforms coherently to conduct large scale attacks, and i'm distinguishing that, because i'm not claiming that iraq will be a paradise. %$* 615
there will continue to be violence, there will continue to be inter-sectarian violence, there will continue to be ethnic violence, and there will continue to be terrorism. %$* 615
the question is, is there a coherent enemy organization on the sunni or shia side running it. %$* 615
if al qaeda actually returned and reestablished significant safe havens, i would say that that was an extremely, uh, negative indicator. %$* 615
and lastly, if large scale, as distinct from periodic, as i say, smaller scale violence and terrorism, if large scale violence between kurds and arabs erupts, that will be a very negative indicator. %$* 615
right now i would say i'm most concerned about the elections, about their legitimacy, particularly of the cor elections, after we’ve drawn down even more forces. %$* 615
i think the reestablishment of special, iranian baath special groups, is ongoing, and we will have to see how that plays out. %$* 615
the other, other indicators right now seem to me to be pretty positive. %$* 615
but i think that’s, those are the things that i would look at to evaluate as we move forward. %$* 615
thank you, fred kagan. %$* 13
and that concludes our q&a section. %$* 13
i want to remind you once again of the numbers. %$* 13
we’re going to take the final vote very shortly, and we would really like you, because it’s establishing our base line, to stay and vote, and we’ll have the results very quickly. %$* 13
all four of these people have argued very strenuously, and we would like to register, to the extent possible, every single, every single mind up there in the seats. %$* 13
reminding you that, coming in, twenty percent of you, with the motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” twenty percent of you were for the motion, fifty-four percent of you were against the motion, and twenty-six percent, nearly a quarter, more than a quarter of you were undecided. %$* 13
we’re now going to move to final statements by each of the panelists. %$* 13
these statements last for two minutes each, and once again the bell will single time being up. %$* 13
and the first to wrap up %$* 13
the first speaker to offer a summary statement will be charles ferguson, director and producer of the award winning iraq war documentary no end in sight. %$* 13
charles ferguson. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 555
let me begin my concluding remarks by answering the last question that was asked about what would constitute victory, as has already, i think, been made clear, sir malcolm and myself both share the view that we’ve long passed the point at which anything approaching victory really is achievable. %$* 555
but let’s suppose for the moment that we magically forget about all the damage done, and we simply focus on starting at this moment. %$* 555
if it were possible for all us troops, not just the twenty-five percent that are combat troops, all us troops to return from iraq, for that to occur with iraq remaining stable, and without further violence: if the five million iraq internally displaced persons and external refugees then returned to iraq, also without violence: if iran abandoned its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and if iraq gets just to number one hundred and fifty in the corruption index, i would consider that we would have made enormous progress. %$* 555
nobody believes these things are going to occur. %$* 555
nobody. %$* 555
nobody. %$* 555
let me unfortunately conclude with an email message i received a few days before my film was happily nominated for an academy award by someone who had seen the film: my son, noah charles pierce, served two tours in iraq, and in your film you showed a scene of kids throwing rocks at trucks, and you can hear the soldiers wanting to shoot the kids. %$* 555
which is true. %$* 555
shortly after the invasion, my son was in baghdad, cleaning up the dead civilians who were being pelted, while being pelted with rocks. %$* 555
the kids grew braver and became more effective until orders came down to shoot them. %$* 555
charles, i'm sorry, i have to cut you off. %$* 13
i'm sorry, i'm going to finish. %$* 555
i'm sorry, i have to— %$* 13
the soldiers gunned them down— %$* 555
charles, i'm sorry, i have to cut you off— %$* 13
last july my son committed suicide— %$* 555
i'm sorry, i'm sorry. %$* 13
was that the end. %$* 13
well, since i talked all over it, and the audience is saying let you finish it, read the last sentence again. %$* 13
ok.my son watched in terror as his fellow soldiers gunned them down. %$* 555
last july my son shot himself. %$* 555
i'm sorry, that's it. %$* 555
charles ferguson. %$* 13
summing up for the motion, general jack keane, a retired four star general, and former vice chief of staff of the us army, a member of the secretary of defense’s policy board, summing up for the motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” %$* 13
as we’ve tried to indicate, iraq, we’ve tried not to re-fight the beginning of the war in iraq, because that was not the purpose here. %$* 614
we’ll also have opinions about that ourselves. %$* 614
and we have admitted openly that we had a failed strategy in iraq for three plus years. %$* 614
but we do have a winning strategy now. %$* 614
and i look at iraq as an opportunity. %$* 614
it is clearly in the united states’ national interest to have an arab muslim country with a duly elected democratic government aligned with the united states in a region of the world, like it or not, that we will spend the next thirty to fifty years involved in. %$* 614
and it will continue to be ideological and serious struggles there. %$* 614
this is a step forward for the national security interests of the american people to have that kind of a relationship with a stable government. %$* 614
we are not there yet, but the signs are clearly there, and they were not there in the past. %$* 614
and with the investments that we are making in resources, and in, certainly with our soldiers’ commitment, and yes, with their lives, that is absolutely worth the sacrifice, in my judgement, in terms of the security of the united states, and what that region, that troubled region of the world will be. %$* 614
there is not a single sunni arab state that surrounds iraq that will not change as a result of the stable, duly-elected democratic government in that country. %$* 614
and the iranians will have to change and be influenced by it as well. %$* 614
and that is the opportunity that is in front of us, and that is why we are so committed to it. %$* 614
and regardless of all the mistakes in the past, that is in front of us right now. %$* 614
thank you, general keane. %$* 13
summarizing his position against the motion, sir malcolm rifkind, former foreign secretary, and a former defense secretary of the united kingdom. %$* 13
sir malcolm? %$* 13
general keane has just said that in his view what might be achieved in iraq is worth the sacrifice that has been made. %$* 616
i think you know that’s a very easy challenge to test. %$* 616
i think we just have to ask ourselves if five years ago we had known that by going to war over a hundred thousand iraqis would die, two million would be refugees in other countries, the internal economy would collapse, the sunni and shia communities would get into sectarian conflict, and we would have helped make iran the real power in the gulf, would we have thought that achieving an iraq government, which was elected, but which is not a true democracy yet and may never be, that that was on balance a sacrifice worth making? %$* 616
i don’t believe that the hundred thousand iraqis who have died, or their families who have survived them, will believe it was a sacrifice worth making. %$* 616
iran is the real winner of this conflict. %$* 616
the iraqi people have been the losers. %$* 616
the fact that they may now have a government which is better than saddam hussein, but what a terrible price they have paid for it. %$* 616
and we know that we’re not going to invade any other country knowing what now know happens when you carry out such a strategy as you have carried out in iraq. %$* 616
thank you, sir malcolm. %$* 13
finally, summing up for the motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” resident scholar in defense and security studies at the american enterprise institute, fred kagan. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 615
i’d like to start by noting for the record that a number of people left, and i have psychic abilities, and i know that all of those people would now vote for the proposition, and i hope that their votes will be counted. %$* 615
look, vote however you want to vote %$* 615
let me step back from that for a minute and just say, this issue is too important for us to continue to be the bird that flies backwards, always looking at where it was, and never looking to where it’s going. %$* 615
and i'm deeply distressed by the tendency in our political class, our political discourse, and unfortunately the presidential race as well, to focus again and again on re-fighting mistakes that every single person up here agrees were made. %$* 615
and every single person up here criticized. %$* 615
the issue is not did we make mistakes. %$* 615
the issue is, where are we now, and where are we headed? %$* 615
and that is what we need to focus on as a nation, because the world will not stop and stand still while we flagellate ourselves, or as some of us flagellate others, for mistakes that were made, and we cannot go through the entirely self-referential exercise of beating ourselves up for what we did wrong, and assume that the world will wait till we get through that, and then do something. %$* 615
the stakes are too high, and we can't have a conversation like that. %$* 615
as for effect on the region, let me simply end with a little story. %$* 615
i went to the border post opposite mehran, which has a major quds force base in iran. %$* 615
and i stood on the border and i spoke with an american officer who, every day, met with and spoke to some of the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of iranian pilgrims who come to iraq every day to go to the holy shrines of najaf and karbala, and in baghdad. %$* 615
fred, i have to cut you off, you have ten seconds. %$* 13
ok. they say three things to him— %$* 615
no, i’ve got to give you ten seconds. %$* 13
this is ten seconds. %$* 615
thank you, we love america, and come visit us soon. %$* 615
thank you, fred kagan. %$* 13
so now we see how this turned out. %$* 13
once again we’d like you to turn to the keypads that are by each of your seats, and reminding you what our motion is, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” if you support the motion press number one, if you are against the motion press number two, if you remain undecided press number three. %$* 13
and within a few seconds, actually, we will have the results. %$* 13
as they are being calculated, i want to remind you of what’s coming down the road. %$* 13
first of all, i want to thank all of you in the audience for really excellent questions. %$* 13
i apologize to the numbers of people, there was a forest of hands up, to the numbers of you who were not able to ask your questions. %$* 13
but i just want to ask you to settle down just a little bit. %$* 13

the motion for moved more of you, thirty-six percent are now for the motion, fifty-three percent are against, eleven percent remain undecided. %$* 13

and you can't point to a single member of congress, to a single independent expenditure where they have felt this kind of pressure. %$* 265
it hasn't happened. %$* 265
and it's not going to happen. %$* 265
now, we can argue about the rules we may need to ensure the independence of these groups. %$* 265
but we think these groups should be able to independently raise as much and speak as much to the american people. %$* 265
the difference between americans getting together and speaking to other americans is one thing. %$* 265
americans and contributing directly to candidates may be a separate issue. %$* 265
i'd also like to point out that before the speechnow decision and the citizens united decision, there were many states, in fact a majority of states in the country that allow unlimited contributions not only to independent expenditure committees but to the candidates themselves. %$* 265
i think what we should be looking at is the quality of the government in those states. %$* 265
and pew, along with governing magazine, pew charitable trusts and governing magazine, rated the states for quality of governance, efficiency of providing services. %$* 265
and the states, six of the best managed states in the country were states where there were unlimited contributions allowed to these types of super pacs, and most of these states also allowed unlimited contributions to the candidates. %$* 265
so good government, efficient government is consistent with people having full free speech rights. %$* 265
all right, so two attacks have been made on your argument that money is corrupting. %$* 13
number one, they said there's no evidence that politicians are-- %$* 13
once in office are arguing-- %$* 13
- are operating as agents of the people who funded them, and, secondly, that there is superior or equally good government in states that have unlimited contribution. %$* 13
so let's-- %$* 268
jonathan soros. %$* 13
go back to the first one for a second. %$* 268
i think in the first instance, i think mr. %$* 268
keating is fighting yesterday's battle as it relates to whether groups are allowed to gather together and form super pacs. %$* 268
they are. %$* 268
the question is should there be rules around that and what should those rules be. %$* 268
our principal argument in ours is that those rules are virtually nonexistent now, and that's a real problem. %$* 268
you're suggesting that there is no evidence of independent expenditures corrupting. %$* 268
i would say we're at the early stages. %$* 268
this is kind of like the year after they invented television, we're looking at television ads, right? %$* 268
we're seeing the first wave of these independent expenditures, and so not clear that that's true, but we're actually not even arguing that, that shouldn't happen, we're not arguing that people shouldn't be allowed to come together in groups and speak in a collaborative voice, in a collective voice. %$* 268
we are arguing that if the evidence presents itself that that is, in fact, corrupting, that you might want to go back and consider regulating that activity as well, but what we are saying is that the rules around independence and separation from the candidates are clearly not there. %$* 268
jacob sullum. %$* 13
could i just ask just a quick question? %$* 265
so do we now have unanimous agreement on the panel that super pacs should be permitted-- %$* 265
are we all in agreement on that? %$* 265
that would be great, because then-- %$* 265
what we just said was that we are starting the first year of this wave of money in federal elections. %$* 267
we don't know yet what the effect is going to be. %$* 267
and what jonathan just said was, "if we find out that they have the same corrupting potential that contributions have been found to have, found by the supreme court to have, based on lengthy trials, that then they, too-- %$* 267
we will have to look at whether they should be limited." one of the things that the court did, as i explained in my opening comment, is to say there's a difference between our own independent speech and a contribution to something. %$* 267
the supreme court has never faced this question of what happens when you take your own money and you contribute to one of these super pacs and somebody else then decides how to spend the money and what to do on the advertising, is that really your own independent speech which the court has said can't be limited, or is that a contribution to a group, and they have found contributions can be limited to prevent the demonstrated danger of corruption. %$* 267
jacob sullum. %$* 13
i think there's-- %$* 266
there's a problem here with the definition of "corruption." i mean, if you take a very broad definition of it, it's basically any inappropriate consideration, right, that causes you to vote a certain way. %$* 266
well, some of it is actual quid pro quo corruption where you hand the guy a pile of cash and you say, "vote my way," and that's definitely illegal, if you can prove it. %$* 266
but if what you're saying is that politicians tend to be grateful for people who support them, or to people support them, then it's true, but that would apply to celebrity endorsements, that would apply not just to super pacs but obviously also to rich people spending their own money independently, which has always been legal, it would apply to voting a certain way because you like the way the lobbyist from that corporation dresses, you think she's pretty. %$* 266
i don't think that's illegal, but it seems improper. %$* 266
you can vote for terrible policies for all kinds of reasons. %$* 266
i think we should be focused more on the policies. %$* 266
i mean, people vote for terrible policies because they have crazy ideologies that drive them to do it, you know. %$* 266
so i don't know why we're focused on this one particular area where there's potential for improper considerations when there are all kinds of other considerations that people might deem improper, and shouldn't we be focusing more on the results, the performance that people actually deliver once they're elected. %$* 266
is it a good performance, is it bad? %$* 266
and part of that whole process is being able to speak on both sides of that. %$* 266
i want to move on and i-- %$* 13
just give me a second and i'll-- %$* 13
i'm going to ask your permission for this-- %$* 13
i want to move on to the second point that david was raising before when i interrupted him. %$* 13
so do you want to respond to that point? %$* 13
and then i'm going to go back to where david was talking before about the actual execution of the rules and regulations. %$* 13
sorry, which one was that? %$* 268
no, you can answer-- %$* 13
you can say what you want to say. %$* 13
but let's stop after that. %$* 13
okay, sure. %$* 268
so just in responding to this question of corrupt-- %$* 268
i think that there are important features that distinguish the different types of influence from the influence of money, right? %$* 268
in the first instance, with money and we're talking about a class of individuals who have a disproportionate and clear influence over the political process. %$* 268
you made a comment in your opening statement that the increase of money and sort of the increase of spending has generated more diversity of thought. %$* 268
well, i don't think that we can rely for political diversity on disagreements between rich people. %$* 268
that's not a political process that allows for a full and open debate. %$* 268
and so let's talk about results-- %$* 268
being rich people. %$* 18
let's talk about results for a moment, right? %$* 268
because when we talk about corruption, we talk about the appearance of corruption, what we're talking about is the integrity of the system of representative government. %$* 268
it's about the belief that citizens have that the people who they elect to office are representing them. %$* 268
and the evidence shows that less than 10 percent of americans in a gallup poll believe that their elected representatives are actually working in their interest. %$* 268
that's a dangerous place for a democracy. %$* 268
okay, let's keep going on this. %$* 13
jacob sullum. %$* 13
the problem with this standard-- %$* 266
this crazy standard-- %$* 266
and i grant you, it was endorsed by the supreme court, but it's still insane-- %$* 266
the appearance of corruption, that we need to prevent the appearance of corruption. %$* 266
so that means the more that jonathan and trevor go around talking about corruption and how horrible it is and how everybody's corrupt and, of course, money buys votes and everybody knows it, even if it's completely false, they go around talking about, now everybody's worried about corruption. %$* 266
that justifies whatever regulations they're proposing. %$* 266
it has this sort of circular quality to it. %$* 266
i don't think it should hinge on the appearance of corruption. %$* 266
maybe it should hinge on the reality of corruption, although i don't buy this argument at all that the fear of even actual corruption, quid pro quo corruption, justifies restrictions on speech. %$* 266
and the supreme court has basically said it does. %$* 266
i think they were wrong. %$* 266
i think that they're moving in the right direction now. %$* 266
but i just don't buy it. %$* 266
is there some kind of, you know, codicil that's attached to the first amendment that says, "except when you're worried about corruption, you know, then you can restrict speech"? %$* 266
david keating. %$* 13
i'll come back to you. %$* 13
david keating. %$* 13
you know, one of the benefits of all this new regulation and all these new laws that we've had basically since the mid-1970s is we've been able now to track how attitudes about government have changed. %$* 265
and what has been found is the states that have the strongest laws, the most restrictive contribution limits, the people have no more faith in those governments than the states where there are unlimited contributions. %$* 265
this has no affect in the people's opinion about the appearance of corruption or the corruption of policies at the state level. %$* 265
so it simply doesn't work. %$* 265
if the idea is that people are going to have more faith in their government from these restrictive laws that are very complicated, burden speech, and prevent grassroots groups from forming easily, they simply don't work. %$* 265
one more point on this. %$* 13
trevor potter. %$* 13
on that, i think we have to recognize-- %$* 267
it's not a reach at all-- %$* 267
that there is, in this, a fundamental difference between the federal government in washington and what is happening at the state level. %$* 267
the federal government has this enormous power. %$* 267
the libertarians in the room will be happy i'm saying this. %$* 267
but it has this enormous power over the purse, the tax system, the way much of american life works. %$* 267
and so it makes sense that if you were seeking a major tax break, if you want your aircraft carrier bought, the big money that you would be trying to influence what congress does, that, it seems to me, is why we see the amount of money being spent on federal elections, and it's vastly more than is going to be spent in state elections, because the benefits of that extra money, if you get your aircraft carrier, your special tax break, the bill that hurts your opponent and saves you, that's huge for the interests that need that. %$* 267
all right. %$* 13
i want to move to the point, david, when i interrupted you at the beginning in your opening comment. %$* 13
your opponent jonathan soros has described the tangle of federal election laws as a swiss cheese of loopholes that's ineffective. %$* 13
i don't know if cheese can be effective or ineffective, but you know what i'm saying. %$* 13
in other words, he's saying there are regulations, but they're not regulating. %$* 13
it's not working at any level. %$* 13
and i want you to take that point on. %$* 13
well, i would agree that we need to have more clarity about what's permitted and what is not about fundraising, candidates, and these single-issue pacs, and, i think, single- issue-- %$* 265
single-candidate super pacs. %$* 265
and i think part of the problem is no one has asked the question whether a candidate can raise money for one of these single-candidate pacs. %$* 265
my view is the candidates cannot do that, and they should not be doing that. %$* 265
and i think it would be helpful if that was made clear. %$* 265
but the laws-- %$* 265
so, just to be clear, do we have agreement on this panel that there should be more regulation of super pacs? %$* 268
no, that's-- %$* 265
i'm not talking about regulating the people. %$* 265
i'm talking about regulating the candidates. %$* 265
to me, that's a different thing. %$* 265
when people-- %$* 265
let me say, the laws on coordination are actually-- %$* 265
they're not as weak as you make them out to be. %$* 265
it's not just a matter of sharing inside information, although that's part of it. %$* 265
there-- %$* 265
and it covers much more than independent expenditures. %$* 265
it's any communication that's run within 90 days of an election is covered by the laws on coordination. %$* 265
and a communication is considered coordinated if it meets one of just any one of five different tests. %$* 265
one is if the communication is requested or suggested by the candidate or if you suggested it somehow to the candidate, and the candidate agreed. %$* 265
you don't need formal collaboration or formal agreement to this from the candidate. %$* 265
if the candidate or their committee or their party is materially involved in the decisions in any way; if someone creates the communication after one or more substantial discussions about the campaign's plans, projects or needs; or if they employ a common vendor and use any of that information, or they use someone who is previously employed by the campaign in the previous 120 days. %$* 265
so-- %$* 265
these are all rules that you-- %$* 13
that are in place that you think are being enforced and that are effectively limiting speech already? %$* 13
that they're-- %$* 13
that they're having effect? %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 265
this is part of maintaining the independence. %$* 265
i don't have a problem with that because i've said i think independent groups-- %$* 265
i think americans should be able to get together and independently of the parties and the candidates, be able to speak about where the country should be headed, what candidates should be elected or what candidates should be defeated. %$* 265
but in a-- %$* 13
i'm just a little unclear on the point that you were just making. %$* 13
were you going through a list of rules that you feel you're good with? %$* 13
these are the rules that exist today. %$* 265
okay. %$* 13
i think a lot of people say, oh, there really aren't any laws against coordination. %$* 265
i mean, the idea that someone used to work for a candidate, it wouldn't be surprising that they would support the candidate. %$* 265
they probably worked with them. %$* 265
they've seen the candidate as a good person, maybe a good leader potentially. %$* 265
it wouldn't be surprising-- %$* 265
okay. %$* 13
they'd want to get involved. %$* 265
so trevor potter and jonathan soros, what david keating has said is there are rules in place, and they're-- %$* 13
there is regulation. %$* 13
and some of it they're okay with, and that your argument that there's a swiss cheese of loopholes is a great exaggeration. %$* 13
well, i heard david say-- %$* 267
trevor potter. %$* 13
it gives me great hope in the outcome of the debate because i heard him say that there are rules in place. %$* 267
we may need more rules, and that would seem to support our side of the proposition. %$* 267
but let's talk about the rules that are actually here. %$* 267
you know, david-- %$* 267
i think david has to say that it's important that these groups be independent because the supreme court said, in allowing these independent groups to exist, that the reason they wouldn't corrupt and therefore could take unlimited money, they're totally independent of candidate and party committees. %$* 267
as i think jonathan did a good job of saying, totally independent of candidate and party committees? %$* 267
you do have former campaign aids, lawyers, fundraisers for the candidates running these things. %$* 267
unfortunately, one of the few times the fec has not dead locked in the last couple years was actually agreeing that candidates could raise money for these super pacs as long as they did so within only limited amounts. %$* 267
we have incidents this year of the candidates traveling with the principal funder of a super pac, candidates thanking the super pac when he left the race saying he couldn't have done it without them. %$* 267
this seems to me not to be totally independent of candidates and parties. %$* 267
jacob sullum. %$* 13
yeah, i think, you know, there is an issue here. %$* 266
i mean, it does look-- %$* 266
get rid of these limits on contributions to candidates then you can raise whatever money you want to raise for your own message, and you will be responsible for your own message, and you can't play this game of saying, oh, we can't coordinate. %$* 266
i can't talk to them. %$* 266
and you have to be responsible for your own speech. %$* 266
that's not to say that you get rid of the genuinely independent voices. %$* 266
but i think if what you're worried about is this sort of sneakiness, you know, it's kind of like, you know, a prostitute who pretends she's an escort, or you go into a head shop, and they got all these fancy water pipes, and it's for-- %$* 266
you know, for use only with tobacco or other legal herbs. %$* 266
and you might say these are very dishonest people. %$* 266
but in fact, it's bad laws that produce that kind of dishonesty. %$* 266
so we've got bad laws we should get rid of. %$* 266
all right. %$* 13
i want to go in a moment to you in the audience to take questions from you and to remind you that i encourage you to-- %$* 13
to be terse in your questions, to try to really make it a question that's related to our topic. %$* 13
and i'm fine with you stating a short premise, but i really don't want you to make a speech because these are the guys who have to make the speeches. %$* 13
and what will happen is if i call on you, there will be a microphone in the aisle passed over to you. %$* 13
please stand up. %$* 13
we would appreciate it if you will tell us your name and then hold the microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth. %$* 13
so as that is getting set up, i just want to take one more question-- %$* 13
one more point back to the side that is arguing against super pacs from your opponents. %$* 13
it was very much a thrust of their argument that there is a first amendment here-- %$* 13
issue in this. %$* 13
and you haven't addressed at all whether in fact there is a valid core at all to their argument that there is a free speech issue here. %$* 13
and, you know, you may-- %$* 13
you may feel that there are other interests that outweigh it, or you may feel there is no free speech and just-- %$* 13
but i want to hear your view on it. %$* 13
is there anything to it? %$* 13
jonathan soros. %$* 13
i actually think that trevor acknowledged that in the first line of his remarks. %$* 268
that there is a free speech interest here. %$* 268
but what i-- %$* 268
and i wanted to-- %$* 268
i guess we're not going to go back and have time, but i was really startled by the comment about corruption not being a sufficient logic for countervailing some of that. %$* 268
so to focus on "congress shall pass no law," that's just not true. %$* 268
we have lots of laws that curtail our speech in favor of some other public interest. %$* 268
and here there's a clear public interest in protecting the integrity of our electoral process from the possibility of corruption. %$* 268
all right. %$* 13
but it is a curtailment of speech, regulation of money and politics would be-- %$* 13
can be, yeah. %$* 268
and again, as trevor indicated-- %$* 268
the supreme court actually didn't do a terrible job with this when they addressed the question in buckley, to say there are different considerations when you are speaking yourself that has a stronger interest than when you are giving money to other folks, when you're making a contribution. %$* 268
and so the limits and the rules that you put around that have to be appropriately tailored to how strong the interests are. %$* 268
but to your partner's point on that, trevor. %$* 13
well, i mean, the answer is, of course. %$* 267
when you're talking about the first amendment and political speech, you're going to have a free speech issue when you are regulating money in politics. %$* 267
but that doesn't-- %$* 267
that just starts the question. %$* 267
it doesn't answer the question. %$* 267
the supreme court itself, in citizens united said government can't choose among speakers. %$* 267
listeners have the right to hear every speaker. %$* 267
the government's role is not to decide who speaks. %$* 267
great absolutist language. %$* 267
the next case that comes along is a group of foreigners who say, good, i want to speak. %$* 267
i live in new york. %$* 267
i happen to work here. %$* 267
i'm not a u.s.citizen. %$* 267
there's a law that says i can't speak. %$* 267
people should hear me. %$* 267
it's a first amendment right of the american people to hear me. %$* 267
the court throws them out on their ear. %$* 267
so this is not a clean-cut issue. %$* 267
you look at this in balance among other things, as the court has done: the integrity of our government, the importance that people have confidence in the decisions being made, and then you look at where the money is spent, how it is disclosed, what we know. %$* 267
those are all aspects of this. %$* 267
all right. %$* 13
so jacob sullum, they're saying the free speech-- %$* 13
it's another example, or free speech is not an absolute right. %$* 13
well, i mean, this particular exception was just kind of pulled out of thin air. %$* 266
but there are other kinds of restrictions like those that prevent fraud. %$* 266
i mean, that's a kind of speech restriction, but it has to do with preventing a right violation. %$* 266
and other-- %$* 266
you know, other exceptions like obscenity that i don't necessarily agree with. %$* 266
but i just never-- %$* 266
have never bought this particular argument. %$* 266
seems invented from whole cloth. %$* 266
and i want to say one thing in favor of disagreeing rich people. %$* 266
is that how you put it, jonathan? %$* 266
yes. %$* 268
i mean, don't knock them. %$* 266
i mean, first of all, you have people of more modest means, as david pointed out, who can pool their money as a result of having super pacs. %$* 266
but there is something to be said for disagreeing rich people. %$* 266
you've got billionaires, you know, who favor democrats, and you have billionaires who favor republicans. %$* 266
you've got a bunch of rich guys who got together and put together a group called "the campaign for primary accountability," which i love, because what they do is they go around the country. %$* 266
they look for entrenched incumbents of both parties, and they target them for defeat. %$* 266
and i think this is a great thing. %$* 266
and just to give you one example of what most people will consider to be a progressive outcome, there was a congressional race in texas where sylvestre reyes, who was a long-time congressman, very comfortable, terrible on the war on drugs. %$* 266
he was challenged by a guy named beto o'rourke. %$* 266
i think that's his name. %$* 266
he's a former city councilman. %$* 266
and he got help from the campaign for primary accountability. %$* 266
and i don't know how much it helped him, but it presumably helped him somewhat, and he won. %$* 266
so you now have a guy who is written in favor of legalizing marijuana, written a book about it in fact. %$* 266
it says we need serious drug policy reform, replacing a hard line drug warrior. %$* 266
both democrats, right? %$* 266
so that's an example of how rich people-- %$* 266
disagreeing rich people can-- %$* 266
can aid progressive causes. %$* 266
and of course in the republican presidential primaries, you had rick santorum and newt gingrich-- %$* 266
these are not the greatest examples, but they did hang in there a lot longer than they would have, thanks to rich guys who gave money to super pacs supporting them. %$* 266
mitt romney had challengers who were different in some particular ways from him, not identical, in some ways better than him on certain issues, you know, it's not a great group to pick among, but-- %$* 266
but it-- %$* 266
very clearly they could stay in that race. %$* 266
that race was more competitive than it otherwise would have been, thanks to the super pac money. %$* 266
i want to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters arguing it out over this motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." let's hear from our audience. %$* 13
that was-- %$* 13
i'm considering using that applause, that was-- %$* 13
we could make that a moment. %$* 13
i'm going to pass, though. %$* 13
any hands up. %$* 13
on the far-- %$* 13
gentleman on the aisle there, and if you wouldn't mind rising so that we can see you, thanks. %$* 13
yes, my name is jay lipow i've always believed that a fundamental right like free speech can be abrogated only if you can show a compelling state interest. %$* 269
and i haven't seen any evidence that the presumption or the likelihood of corruption is satisfactory to prove a compelling state interest. %$* 269
there hasn't been shown any actual corruption, has there? %$* 269
all right, challenge to the side that's arguing against super pacs. %$* 13
trevor potter. %$* 13
as i think i tried to explain earlier, there has. %$* 267
there are people who have gone to jail for actual corruption proved at trials. %$* 267
in the mccain-feingold litigation, former members of congress were interviewed by the other side who objected to the law, saying, "did you ever see actual corruption? %$* 267
"the answer was, "yes, i saw that money changed what happened in the congress of the united states." either the desire to fundraise and get money from particular interests or the facts that they had given money to party committees and, therefore, party leaders said, "we can't go after that, we can't do this-- %$* 267
can you give us an-- %$* 13
"-- %$* 267
because of-- %$* 267
a concrete example, not quite hypothetical of the sort-- %$* 13
you know, do you recall any specifics of any sort of deal that was done that way? %$* 13
sure, senator mccain testified that in the republican caucus when the subject came up of tobacco legislation the republican leader said, "they've just given us hundreds of thousands of dollars. %$* 267
this is something we really can't support." %$* 267
that's worrisome. %$* 13
jacob sullum. %$* 13
can i push-- %$* 266
i want to push this definition of corruption a little bit because i think-- %$* 266
no, no, but can you respond to that case? %$* 13
to that example? %$* 13
if that happened, does that-- %$* 13
you're talking about soft money, is that the deal? %$* 266
correct, sell contributions to party committees. %$* 267
yeah, yeah, i don't think that should be happening. %$* 266
is that the question? %$* 266
yeah, it should not be happening. %$* 266
yeah, yeah, that's the question, yeah. %$* 13
but seriously think about what you have in mind when you say, "corruption." there's a guy, a state senator in new york, roy mcdonald, who voted in favor of the gay marriage bill and the primary's tomorrow, right? %$* 266
so he is up for reelection, or he's up for renomination tomorrow, and before he decided to vote in favor of the gay marriage bill, he had assurances from gay rights activists that they would help him raise money to support his campaign. %$* 266
is that corruption? %$* 266
and i think that your idea of whether that is corruption is going to hinge on your policy views to a large extent. %$* 266
so keep that in mind. %$* 266
i'm-- %$* 266
you know, just think about it. %$* 266
sir, on the aisle, yep. %$* 13
mic is coming to you from behind you. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
jamie weinstein, senior editor of the daily caller. %$* 270
jacob kind of stole my thunder at the end with my question, but i would like to get your side to answer it. %$* 270
he pointed to the republican primary this year, and it actually seems to be more competitive because of the super pacs. %$* 270
gingrich and santorum were able to stay in the race longer and gave mitt romney a challenge where he otherwise may have been able to mow down them much more easily without his super pacs. %$* 270
isn't that a positive? %$* 270
more competitive elections? %$* 270
well, what you had was-- %$* 267
trevor potter. %$* 13
huge contributions to what romney referred to as "my super pac," what gingrich clearly saw as his super pac, as a way of getting around the normal contribution limits. %$* 267
i don't know that, that was a particular benefit to anybody, that all the sides were armored up significantly larger than they normally would be in a primary. %$* 267
you're right, the primary went on longer because instead of having to worry about for gingrich whether they were donors who would support him and how he could keep going when he kept losing primaries, all he had to worry about was whether he made one man happy or not-- %$* 267
and under these coordination regulations he could go meet with that man and talk to him. %$* 267
i just want to-- %$* 268
jonathan soros. %$* 13
so i want to echo that. %$* 268
i mean, i think that the issue is, what would have happened if newt gingrich had won the primary? %$* 268
would we have been asking about what he owed to sheldon adelson for the support that he got during the primary? %$* 268
and also, how could we have done this? %$* 266
so i just want to-- %$* 268
you know, we keep talking about the question of corruption, and i want to go back to this notion a little bit of integrity, briefly, that what we're talking about, in part, when we talk about corruption and the appearance of corruption is whether or not people believe in the integrity of the political process, that people are representing them. %$* 268
and i'll just comment that there's actually nothing in our current limit system to give people a lot of confidence. %$* 268
as i said in my opening, when you've got contribution limits of $2,500, those are out of reach for most people in america. %$* 268
and $25,000-- %$* 268
so you end up with a very, very small fraction of people who are contributing as it is. %$* 268
it seems like the system's actually designed to maximize the amount of time that candidates spend with rich people, right? %$* 268
that's one of the reasons that i said, at the end, we really need to be focused on an alternative as well, to focusing on a system where candidates can run for public office where they're not dependent on these contributions. %$* 268
there's a gentleman in a white-- %$* 13
fully white shirt. %$* 13
could you-- %$* 13
sir, could you stand forward a little bit, just into the more lit area so the camera can see you? %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
this question is for the in the affirmative of the motion. %$* 18
you still maintain that money in politics is still overregulated. %$* 18
so i'm just wondering where you find it to be still overregulated and what the right amount of regulation should be. %$* 18
david keating. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 266
jacob sullum. %$* 13
yeah, just briefly, i did mention, i think, that they should get rid of the limits on contributions. %$* 266
i think a lot of the false independence you're worried about, this apparent dishonesty, the evasions and so forth, come out of that. %$* 266
and what happens historically with campaign finance regulation is, they impose one rule, people find a way around it; they propose a new rule, people find a way around that; and so on, and so on, and so on. %$* 266
and speech gets more and more restricted. %$* 266
regulations get more and more complex and intimidating for the average person who might want to get politically involved. %$* 266
and i think we need to-- %$* 266
we cut our losses and make things as simple as possible. %$* 266
i don't buy the distinction between giving versus spending. %$* 266
i think if spending is speech, giving is also speech, or it amounts to speech if you restrict giving. %$* 266
so there should be no limits on giving. %$* 266
i am sort of on the fence about disclosure rules. %$* 266
i think it's legitimate to require candidates, as a condition of running for office, to disclose donors, but i don't think it's necessarily legitimate to require disclosure for independent spenders. %$* 266
there's an argument to be made that that chills speech. %$* 266
in fact, it's designed to chill speech. %$* 266
david keating, would you add any other gripes to that list? %$* 13
well, there's-- %$* 265
first of all, i would agree with a lot of that. %$* 265
i do think it makes sense to allow candidates to decide when they file, as a candidate, what the contribution limit will be, if any, and let the voters decide. %$* 265
so if they want to accept unlimited contributions, the candidates can do that. %$* 265
if the candidates will agree with each other to accept a limit, whether it's today's limit of $2,500 or some other limit of, say, $10,000, let them do that, and let the voters decide. %$* 265
"do i trust this person taking these kinds of money from these kinds of people? %$* 265
" so i think that makes sense. %$* 265
now, there are lots of other laws and regulations. %$* 265
as i said, there's-- %$* 265
the laws and regulations have 376,000 words. %$* 265
for a lot of small grassroots groups that just want to say something about their member of congress, as soon as they spend $1,000, they have to file with the federal election commission. %$* 265
a lot of people just can't navigate these forms and these regulations. %$* 265
and then it's not clear what they're allowed to say and what they're not allowed to say. %$* 265
there are regulations describing what's express advocacy that's regulated by the federal election commission. %$* 265
but people look at the regulation and they don't know what it means. %$* 265
and, in fact, we helped a group that had a question about a number of ads. %$* 265
they submitted nine ads to the federal election commission, and the commission itself couldn't agree whether it was regulated speech or not. %$* 265
this is not a situation that is good for our country, where people want to speak out about what's going on in the election, and they have to hire a lawyer to do it. %$* 265
we've got to simplify the thing so the election law is not more complicated than the tax law. %$* 265
all right. %$* 13
you know, i'm just thinking that, so far this evening, counting myself, the debaters, the questioners, bob rosenkranz, we have heard eight men speaking. %$* 13
are any women going to raise their hands with questions? %$* 13
because i'm looking, but i'm not seeing. %$* 13
right in the middle. %$* 18
have you been doing that the whole time? %$* 13
oh, you're in the dark. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i can't see you. %$* 13
i just want to ask, is that okay for the camera, that you're in the shadows there? %$* 13
yeah, you can pick it up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i was just wondering for the proponents of free speech, without regulation, how do you differentiate between me supporting a candidate with my voice or me going to the store and buying scott's miracle-gro and having my support of green lawns representing a political concern? %$* 19
because that company is supporting a particular cause, you mean? %$* 266
yes. %$* 19
scott's miracle-gro recently-- %$* 19
well, actually, i mean, that's an issue that hasn't actually come up. %$* 266
but that was one of the arguments that the obama administration used in favor of keeping the regulations that were overturned in citizens united. %$* 266
they said there was not only this concern about corruption, but also a shareholder interest. %$* 266
and i guess you're talking about a consumer interest, but it's somewhat similar. %$* 266
i think the answer in both cases is the same. %$* 266
if you're a shareholder in a company, you don't like their political speech, you can-- %$* 266
you can sell those shares, or you can object at a shareholder meeting. %$* 266
if you're a consumer, and you don't like the political speech of the company you're buying from, you can stop buying from them. %$* 266
i mean, you can protest as well. %$* 266
but you have the power to decide where your money is going based on that consideration. %$* 266
jonathan soros. %$* 13
so i'm glad-- %$* 268
thank you very much for raising that. %$* 268
i'm glad that this came up because we haven't talked at all about the corporate question which is actually what citizens united was originally about. %$* 268
so that's an interesting theoretical argument. %$* 268
the problem is scott's miracle-gro decided, voluntarily, to fund a super pac, which is one of the few instances of a public company doing that. %$* 268
so if they decide to give their money in a way that's not disclosed, then as a consumer, you have no idea about it and as a shareholder, you have no idea about it. %$* 268
the second thing is that as a shareholder, you may very well have no ability to do anything about it anyway. %$* 268
so let's-- %$* 268
the issue of corporate democracy, we could go on for a long time. %$* 268
but let's just stick with somebody who owns those shares through a pension fund, right? %$* 268
forty-seven states in this onion, if you're a public employee, you're required to put your money into a pension fund. %$* 268
that money can go anywhere. %$* 268
it can go into any company, and you have no control over it. %$* 268
so there is a problem with corporations speaking because they're speaking on behalf of other people that don't have the ability to give their consent. %$* 268
and you can also suggest maybe you shouldn't have to give your consent in order to participate in the modern economy of owning shares. %$* 268
another question? %$* 13
i'm still gender hunting. %$* 13
right in the center. %$* 13
you were the only woman from seats and seats around. %$* 13
but then i'm going to go back to gender blind after that. %$* 13
do you mind standing up too, please? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
debra jerkerson no. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 13
and we'd just like to ask your name. %$* 13
okay. %$* 271
my name is debra jerkerson. %$* 271
and just going back to david's point that people have a right to sort of organize themselves, or people have a right to change their government, it seems that we're getting into this long conversation about how to regulate money. %$* 271
but on the other hand, you're kind of saying that money doesn't really influence politics. %$* 271
i wanted to go back to what mr. %$* 271
soros is saying, what could we look at as a different system such as campaign finance reform, or public funding of campaigns, and how do you think about that? %$* 271
david keating. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 265
the question is whether we should have tax funded campaigns. %$* 265
and it's very hard to design such a system. %$* 265
i think there are a lot of problems with it. %$* 265
i mean, we talk about disconnecting candidates from the people. %$* 265
if they don't have to raise money for their campaigns, we're disconnecting them additionally. %$* 265
but there's also real questions of how you design such a system so that it's attractive so the candidates will even want to do it. %$* 265
we have tax funded campaigns for the presidential candidates. %$* 265
and in this election, both candidates have decided to forego that financing. %$* 265
in other states where they've designed these tax funded campaign systems, they've designed them in such a way as to penalize independent groups that speak out. %$* 265
now, the supreme court has struck down those provisions. %$* 265
but it makes it even more difficult to design such a system. %$* 265
so i don't think it's terribly workable, for one. %$* 265
second, i don't think it's politically possible to pass, either. %$* 265
when you put together the words basically "tax funding" and "politicians" together, it's not popular. %$* 265
people don't like paying taxes. %$* 265
they don't like their money going to politicians. %$* 265
they don't like politicians generally. %$* 265
so i think if we're looking for solutions to try to make our government more accountable, to provide cleaner government, that that's not something that's probably going to work politically. %$* 265
sir on the aisle? %$* 13
yes. %$* 272
thank you. %$* 272
my name is stanley fish, new york times, professor of law and author of a book called "there's no such thing as free speech, and it's a good thing too." i had a question for mr. %$* 272
keating who said, at the beginning of his address, that the issue is, do we value the first amendment and keep it as it is, which suggested that there was a first amendment that was libertarian in the form that he likes it. %$* 272
but in fact, as i think you know, that's a product of the last 35 years. %$* 272
as early as 1942, in chaplinsky versus new hampshire, there was a paragraph listing all of the forms of speech that do not deserve constitutional protection-- %$* 272
mr. %$* 13
fish, can-- %$* 13
can you land this as a question? %$* 13
sure. %$* 272
thanks. %$* 13
in '71, made the argument that only political speech could be protected so that-- %$* 272
i'm sorry. %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i need you to bring the mic in and just do that last part again. %$* 13
your first amendment is a very recent invention. %$* 272
in fact, an invention that began with new york times versus sullivan which i think is one of the worst cases ever decided. %$* 272
okay. %$* 13
you don't have to respond to that because it wasn't a question. %$* 13
that was a speech. %$* 13
that was one of those things i don't want to have happen. %$* 13
in that case, can i go back to that last point because i think it-- %$* 268
yeah, sure, jon, i'm sorry. %$* 13
because i think it's an important one. %$* 268

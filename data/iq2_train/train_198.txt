i’d now like to bring to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., who brought this to the united states, who has staged them now for over six years in new york, and who has helped bring it here tonight. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
and what bob and i usually do for a couple of minutes beforehand is talk about the purpose of doing this debate and the timing of this debate. %$* 13
and bob, let me get right to the question: why do this debate now? %$* 13
well, the debate is timely because president obama in his state of the union message made one of his centerpieces a policy suggestion, the idea of raising the minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $9. %$* 1
and why do you think the president decided to do that now? %$* 13
well, increasing the minimum wage is very tempting for politicians, because it’s conferring a benefit and the government is not paying for it. %$* 1
so it seems like a popular thing to do. %$* 1
and besides that, the beneficiaries, at least the way he characterized them, are hard working people who are struggling to support a family on a minimum wage. %$* 1
so if it is that attractive. %$* 13
where is there a debate in this? %$* 13
well, the debate is really about second-order effects. %$* 1
economists like to say there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and if we raise the minimum wage, it has consequences; it means that people who go to mcdonald’s are going to have to pay more because those costs are going to be passed along to consumers. %$* 1
it means that companies that hire minimum wage workers are going to make smaller profits; invest less in their businesses, and spend less. %$* 1
but the biggest argument, i think, is sort of, economics 101. if you raise the price of teenage labor, there’s simply going to be less demand for it; and if there’s less demand, it means fewer kids get on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, fewer kids learn how-- %$* 1
the demands of the workplace and responsibility of showing up. %$* 1
and those are the real cost of a rise in the minimum wage. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
so there i’m hearing basically the argument for abolition. %$* 13
what is the other side? %$* 13
well, i think what the other side is going to say is that the effects that i’m talking about are relatively modest in the way they’re going to play out, and the benefits outweigh those costs, and the people who do benefit from this are deserving, hardworking people. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
let’s bring our debaters to the stage, and thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
i’d just like to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making all of this happen. %$* 13
two bits, 25 cents an hour. %$* 13
that is what the minimum wage paid back in 1938.that is 1/29th of what it pays today. %$* 13
and whether you’re working a job to get through college, or whether you’re greeting customers at a super store to make ends meet, at some point that minimum has been or is going to be your wage. %$* 13
and how well has that worked out for the economy, this 75-year experiment? %$* 13
well, it sure sets up a good debate, so let’s have it. %$* 13
“yes” or “no” to this statement: “abolish the minimum wage”? %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan; i will be moderating. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for and against the motion, “abolish the minimum wage.”our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is, “abolish the minimum wage.” and let’s meet the team. %$* 13
arguing first for the motion, ladies and gentlemen, welcome james dorn. %$* 13
james, you are the cato institute vice president for academic affairs; you are also editor of the cato journal. %$* 13
you have in the past referred to a potential minimum wage hike as, quote, “a case of zombie economics.” that’s a phrase you borrowed from paul krugman, who used it an article. %$* 13
for audience members who are not familiar with your work, if paul krugman is at one end of the spectrum, where does that put you? %$* 13
well, i work in the cato institute, so that puts me at the opposite end of the spectrum. %$* 532
i think the minimum wage is zombie economics. %$* 532
all right. %$* 13
thank you, james dorn. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the great rapper russell roberts. %$* 532
ladies and gentlemen, russell roberts. %$* 13
russell, you are also arguing for the motion, “abolish the minimum wage.” you’re a research fellow at the hoover institute; you are host of the podcast, “econtalk,” and a former george mason university economics professor. %$* 13
and the word rapper came up; in fact, you wrote and produced-- %$* 13
co-wrote and co-produced a rap song on economics that sounds something like this. %$* 13
wow. %$* 13
it’s called “fight of the century.” how many people have seen that? %$* 533
we actually-- %$* 533
with john papola, we produced two of them, two rap videos. %$* 533
and i want to make it clear on the record i’m not singing in either one of them. %$* 533
6.3 million people have viewed them on youtube, or maybe a few less than that, because people have kind of seen it 4- or 500 times. %$* 533
you’ve gone viral. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, russell roberts. %$* 13
our motion is to abolish the minimum wage, and we have two debaters here to argue strenuously against it. %$* 13
first, let’s welcome, ladies and gentlemen, jared bernstein. %$* 13
jared, you’re a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities; you are former chief economist to vice president biden. %$* 13
you are now known as one of the top progressive economists in washington, d.c., but before you were invited to the obama administration you were on a different career path, one that informs your work today. %$* 13
tell us what it is. %$* 13
well, i was also a rapper. %$* 534
no. %$* 534
i was social worker in new york city, and as i’ll comment later throughout the discussion that was where i first learned how important the minimum wage is to low income working families. %$* 534
so social work and economics-- %$* 13
very much-- %$* 534
very-- %$* 534
i mean, if i had my way, every economist would have to be a social worker for a couple of years before they got to be an economist. %$* 534
okay. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is my old friend and wonderful policy analyst, karen kornbluh. %$* 534
ladies and gentlemen, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
karen, you are also against the motion, “abolish the minimum wage.” you started your career as an economic analyst; you worked, actually, with alan greenspan. %$* 13
you were also an ambassador to the organization for economic cooperation and development. %$* 13
you got started in politics working for a senator named barack obama. %$* 13
you have been described as “obama’s brain,” a phrase that you’re tired of hearing, and you were the chief architect of the 2008 democratic party platform. %$* 13
and, actually, i understand that you got your start in the public side of this based on something that your dad did? %$* 13
yes, my dad was involved in local politics. %$* 535
he served in a couple local positions in new york city. %$* 535
this was before take your daughter to work day? %$* 13
yes, yes, yes. %$* 535
i was very lucky he could take me to work. %$* 535
i got to see a lot of fascinating meetings and somehow decided to work with politics anyway. %$* 535
the meetings were that fascinating? %$* 13
that fascinating. %$* 535
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
so our motion is “abolish the minimum wage.” and we-- %$* 13
as i said before, what we do is we have you vote two times, once before the debate and once again after the debate, and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
it-- %$* 13
we’ll just have you go to the preliminary vote now. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion at this point, push number one; if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
i’ll put it in a different way: if you’re for the motion, this team, push number one; if you’re against the motion, this team, push number two. %$* 13
and if you’re undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can avoid-- %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys, they’re not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
while you’re doing that, i just want to, once again, thank wamu for partnering with us on this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
so, it looks like everybody's complete. %$* 13
interestingly, that always turns out to be a very complicated process in new york. %$* 13
there's a-- %$* 13
there's a lot of-- %$* 13
so that was pretty impressive. %$* 13
so remember how you voted. %$* 13
we'll vote a second time after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
so onto round 1, opening statements from each team, each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, “abolish the minimum wage.” and here to speak first for the motion, russell roberts. %$* 13
he is a research fellow at the hoover institution. %$* 13
he is host of the award-winning podcast “econ talk.” he blogs at “cafe hayek” and is a former professor of economics at george mason university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, russell roberts. %$* 13
we need to abolish the minimum wage. %$* 533
and there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument. %$* 533
does the minimum wage make the world a better place? %$* 533
and does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest american families and the workers who are in those families? %$* 533
now, those americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades. %$* 533
they find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers. %$* 533
their job opportunities have shrunk. %$* 533
their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people. %$* 533
it attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes. %$* 533
and by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help. %$* 533
you don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work. %$* 533
now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are-- %$* 533
that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up. %$* 533
but in reality, most of us don't need that extra help. %$* 533
95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million americans-- %$* 533
95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already. %$* 533
and that includes my cleaning lady, who i pay over two times the minimum wage. %$* 533
now, why do i do that? %$* 533
because i'm an incredibly nice person. %$* 533
well, that's what i like to think. %$* 533
but i really know better, because i'm an economist. %$* 533
the reason i play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if i don't, she doesn't show up. %$* 533
she has other alternatives that she will turn to if i don't meet her market wage. %$* 533
it is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers. %$* 533
and alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force. %$* 533
but the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million americans. %$* 533
about half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24.they get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage. %$* 533
but those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience. %$* 533
this is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent. %$* 533
and for african americans-- %$* 533
young african americans, it's over 29 percent. %$* 533
almost one in three. %$* 533
now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment. %$* 533
but who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs? %$* 533
that's why employers replace workers with machines. %$* 533
that's why they send factories overseas. %$* 533
and that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture. %$* 533
and by the way, the u.s.manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving. %$* 533
but in employment terms, it's struggling. %$* 533
and those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job. %$* 533
those opportunities are shrinking. %$* 533
why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school-- %$* 533
why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off? %$* 533
why would it have no effect on their employment? %$* 533
consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship. %$* 533
the internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage. %$* 533
you pay zero. %$* 533
you're allowed to pay zero. %$* 533
you're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero. %$* 533
how strange is that? %$* 533
but we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing. %$* 533
it's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their-- %$* 533
at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace. %$* 533
and thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero. %$* 533
does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people? %$* 533
others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small-- %$* 533
the employment effects. %$* 533
small? %$* 533
when you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent. %$* 533
so it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work? %$* 533
we're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many. %$* 533
i don't accept that tradeoff. %$* 533
that's a tragedy. %$* 533
i reject it. %$* 533
it's a bad bargain. %$* 533
the irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end. %$* 533
it reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them. %$* 533
the best argument for the minimum wage is that our school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom. %$* 533
but this is the wrong way to fix it. %$* 533
it's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of america, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education, the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career. %$* 533
i beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results. %$* 533
abolish the minimum wage. %$* 533
let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper. %$* 533
thank you very much. %$* 533
thank you, russell roberts. %$* 13
our motion is "abolish the minimum wage." and now here to speak against this motion, jared bernstein, he is a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities, also served as chief economist to vice president joe biden, and executive director of the white house task force on the middle class. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jared bernstein. %$* 13
well, i'm glad to see all of you here and that you've chosen this over other d.c.options you had tonight. %$* 534
you could be looking at the cherry blossoms or seeing the nationals play, but you've come to talk and debate the minimum wage, so you're my kind of people. %$* 534
so i'm glad you're here. %$* 534
here is my main point. %$* 534
luckily, for our side, strongly against abolishing the minimum wage, almost everything you just heard from russ is shown to be false by a large body of compelling research. %$* 534
so let me start with my main point. %$* 534
abolishing the minimum wage would be a terrible policy mistake that would needlessly hurt millions of low wage workers. %$* 534
it's not a policy, this idea of abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 534
this policy is nowhere near the current agenda. %$* 534
in fact, as you've heard, the current debate asks whether the minimum wage should be increased. %$* 534
now, it is true that during the republican primary, michele bachmann and herman cain endorsed the idea in the republican primary of abolishing the minimum wage, but that idea of abolishing a policy that's been in place since the 1930s, helping low wage workers, is about as far out of the mainstream as you can get, and let me explain why. %$* 534
now, this gray hair i have, i got through a lifetime, as was mentioned earlier, of analyzing social and economic policies, beginning as a social worker in new york city with the poor, and i worked my way-- %$* 534
i don't want to say up, sideways, wherever it is i am now-- %$* 534
to whatever it is i'm doing today. %$* 534
and, you know, over those decades, i focused on two things, what's gone wrong in our economy and which policies could help give less advantaged folks a shot, a fair chance? %$* 534
it's through that simple agenda that decades ago i became interested in minimum wage policy. %$* 534
as globalization, and technological change, and a lot of other stuff that we can talk about throughout the evening have evolved, economic growth no longer reaches working families the way it used to. %$* 534
and the further you go down the pay scale, the less growth you're likely to see. %$* 534
the minimum wage partially helps offset that problem. %$* 534
and, in fact, you will be hard pressed to find a policy that does what it sets out to do, raising the pay of low wage workers, more effectively or more efficiently. %$* 534
and importantly, and this is why i stressed it when i started, and we'll have lots of time to get into this, i hope, reams of high quality research shows that it does so with the minimum of the type of side effects that you heard russ emphasize. %$* 534
consider this, just start here with a little commonsense thought experiment. %$* 534
the american minimum wage, as you've heard, has been in place since 1938, 75 years ago. %$* 534
it has been raised 22 times. %$* 534
nineteen states now have their own minimum wages above the federal level. %$* 534
if this policy was so damaging, as damaging as russ claims, that it needs to be abolished, how could it be that citizens and legislatures in 19 states decided not to abolish it, but to raise it above the federal level? %$* 534
if it was anywhere near as damaging as our opponents claim, how could the minimum wage not only have survived this long, but have flourished and expanded? %$* 534
the answer, once again, is because it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers, and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelmingly support the policy-- %$* 534
that's very important, i'll come back to that-- %$* 534
as doing what it's supposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way. %$* 534
now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, would figuratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many of whom-- %$* 534
and karen will emphasize these points-- %$* 534
depend on the minimum wage to support their families. %$* 534
it's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers’ issue. %$* 534
it's not. %$* 534
for these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in the federal-- %$* 534
in the federal minimum wage. %$* 534
now, that's what we ought to actually be debating. %$* 534
i firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debates about that kind of a proposal-- %$* 534
should the minimum wage be increased or not? %$* 534
but that's not what we're arguing about. %$* 534
that's not what you're voting on on the resolution. %$* 534
our opponents think that america should have no minimum wage at all. %$* 534
to me, a better question than that-- %$* 534
than the one on notice tonight, should be-- %$* 534
should the minimum wage be abolished? %$* 534
the better question is why anyone would even suggest such a bad idea? %$* 534
so, why would you-- %$* 534
why would you even think that? %$* 534
and i think the answer comes down to two factors. %$* 534
first, common misconceptions, ones that should have been banished by the research. %$* 534
and second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense and empirical evidence. %$* 534
now, a word about this evidence. %$* 534
there's probably no question that's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers. %$* 534
and the conclusion is that it raises the pay of low-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects. %$* 534
of literally thousands of estimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, the vast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers-- %$* 534
the benefits to low-wage workers-- %$* 534
exactly the opposite of what's-- %$* 534
of what russell claims-- %$* 534
the benefits for low- wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss. %$* 534
now, recall that i mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levels exist. %$* 534
that's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rare in economics-- %$* 534
pseudo-experimentation. %$* 534
the best way to test the impact of an intervention like this is to compare places that are as like-- %$* 534
as-- %$* 534
in terms of economic variables as you can find. %$* 534
yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't. %$* 534
these studies, this pseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistently found results, job loss effects, that hover around zero. %$* 534
sometimes a little bit below. %$* 534
i will grant the other side that. %$* 534
sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive, but hover around zero. %$* 534
so we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed to do with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects. %$* 534
abolishing it makes absolutely no sense at all. %$* 534
thank you. %$* 534
thank you. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
thank you, jared bernstein. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, “abolish the minimum wage.” you have heard two of the opening statements, and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating in support of the motion, to abolish the minimum wage, the vice president for academic affairs at the cato institute, editor of the cato journal, and professor of economics at towson university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, james dorn. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 532
it's a pleasure to be here. %$* 532
i hope you will keep an open mind and vote for abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 532
jared gave some evidence-- %$* 532
there was just a new study out by david neumark, written for the nber, national bureau of economic research, one of the foremost research organizations in the united states, with top scholars. %$* 532
he refutes much of what jared just said. %$* 532
actually, the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the fact that the minimum wage does destroy jobs. %$* 532
why? %$* 532
because if anybody believes in the law of demand, it means when prices go up, there's less of it that people buy. %$* 532
and nobody's ever disproven the law of demand, not even jared. %$* 532
nobody in congress has disproven the law of demand. %$* 532
so, i think we should keep that in mind. %$* 532
hong kong never had a minimum wage. %$* 532
i've been over-- %$* 532
i've been visiting china since 1988, every year, just about. %$* 532
hong kong started to develop in trade in 1938 and it was just a bunch of shanties and everything. %$* 532
hong kong rose up to be one of the most prosperous places in the world without a minimum wage. %$* 532
so the minimum wage is neither necessary nor sufficient for prosperity; what prosperity requires is opportunities. %$* 532
the minimum wage destroys opportunities. %$* 532
i had a friend of mine, his mother was working at a department store up in new hampshire. %$* 532
after the kids grew up, she was making close to the minimum wage. %$* 532
the minimum wage went up, she lost her job. %$* 532
she enjoyed this job; it changed her whole life. %$* 532
and she was denied the opportunity to go back and offer her labor services at the pre-minimum wage; that is, the wage that she was agreeing to work at freely. %$* 532
the minimum wage interferes with individual freedom and economic freedom. %$* 532
and that's what's wrong with the minimum wage to a large extent. %$* 532
it reduces-- %$* 532
it reduces-- %$* 532
it doesn't increase workers' bargaining power because it makes it illegal for the worker to offer her labor services for less than the minimum even though she's willing to do so because that's a better opportunity for her. %$* 532
and it makes it illegal for the employer to hire that worker. %$* 532
also, it should be obvious that if you increase the wage rate above the going market wage rate, if it's only a little bit above, it's not going to have much of an effect. %$* 532
but if it's quite a bit above, as happened in new york state in the early 2000s, then it led to a about 20 percent decrease in the unemployment rate in new york state for teenage workers aged about 16 to 24 without a high school diploma. %$* 532
they kind of cut off the bottom rung for the ladder. %$* 532
they couldn't get in the market. %$* 532
there was a surplus. %$* 532
there's lots of jobs when the wage rate is lower; when if goes higher, there's fewer jobs. %$* 532
but many workers want to get those jobs at the minimum wage. %$* 532
the government promises people a minimum wage, but the politicians can't keep that promise because there's two sides to the market. %$* 532
the employers will not hire as many workers when the wage rate goes up. %$* 532
and in the short run, there may not be much unemployment. %$* 532
but in the longer run, as russ pointed out, the employers will substitute skilled workers for unskilled workers. %$* 532
they might use a computer and have one worker rather than ten, or they may substitute labor-saving devices. %$* 532
and there's lots of evidence to show this. %$* 532
just an article in the wall street journal over the weekend, woman was running-- %$* 532
she runs bakeries, cupcake bakeries. %$* 532
she hires-- %$* 532
she has about ten young workers working for her. %$* 532
she said because of the anticipated increase in the minimum wage and the indexation, that she's going to replace those ten workers with some tablets and a skilled worker to run the operation so that they can order using the tablets. %$* 532
another person that owns some restaurants and so forth, he's going to go to use his new app called squared, which basically makes it easier to clear checks and process credit cards. %$* 532
and he will displace about 30 out of his 75 workers, he said in that interview. %$* 532
so this is a reality. %$* 532
the woman that lost her job in new hampshire, that's not just a statistic, that's a personal story. %$* 532
we can play games with statistics. %$* 532
and there's a preponderance of evidence, as i said, that the minimum wage has these detrimental effects. %$* 532
in fact, neumark in his study, after looking at all these other studies, said his conclusion has not changed. %$* 532
and it's a very, very rigorous study. %$* 532
what else happens? %$* 532
employers use temporary workers rather than full-time workers. %$* 532
they might make one worker do the job of four because after all, there's a surplus of labor now. %$* 532
there's unemployed workers that are looking for these jobs so they can just, you know, lay somebody off and make the other workers work that much harder. %$* 532
it also destroys jobs, jobs that used to be done in the united states. %$* 532
when i was a kid, they had elevator operators in buffalo, new york. %$* 532
you won't see those anymore. %$* 532
you might see them in argentina. %$* 532
they don't have baggers at the grocery stores. %$* 532
those have become full-time jobs, in many cases, unionized. %$* 532
and it slows job growth. %$* 532
there was just a new study out by texas a&m showing that the minimum wage has slowed job growth, which we should expect. %$* 532
how do you explain these huge unemployment rates among black male teenagers that are, you know, over 30 percent? %$* 532
in spain, they have a very rigid minimum wage. %$* 532
and the unemployment rate there is 26 percent, the national rate. %$* 532
the unemployment rate among younger workers-- %$* 532
unskilled workers who are typically younger workers, is double that. %$* 532
how do you explain that? %$* 532
the minimum wage, also, by the way, does not reduce the poverty rate. %$* 532
poverty rate has actually increased a little bit because of the minimum wage. %$* 532
doug adie and other people have looked at that; neumark as well. %$* 532
and if you can't get a job-- %$* 532
because, remember, the law-- %$* 532
what does it do? %$* 532
it increases the wage rate, but if you don't get a job, your income is zero. %$* 532
that's what a lot of people don't understand. %$* 532
the difference between the wage rate, which is the price, and income, which is the price of labor times the hours worked. %$* 532
if you can't get a job, your income's zero. %$* 532
so we found that the people that this affects are low skilled workers in low income families, and that's why the poverty rate is affected. %$* 532
okay, so-- %$* 532
james dorn, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
okay, so-- %$* 532
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is "abolish the minimum wage." and our final speaker here to speak against the motion to abolish the minimum wage, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
she is the former u.s.ambassador to the organization for economic cooperation and development and former policy director for then-senator barack obama. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 535
i want to return to the moral question that we started with because the moral question is all on our side. %$* 535
let's talk about what would happen to real people in real families if the u.s.were to go down this untested and quite radical path of eliminating the minimum wage as our opponents urge. %$* 535
what i want you to understand is that roughly one quarter of all children in the united states, more than 17 million children, have a parent earning the minimum wage or just above. %$* 535
another way to think about this, only-- %$* 535
almost one of three of those who benefit from the minimum wage, so they're just at the minimum wage or they're just above it, and so they're what we think that their wages are bumped up because of the minimum wage, are parents. %$* 535
one in three. %$* 535
that means that today, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage because of the low level of our minimum wage is still living below the poverty line at today's level of the minimum wage. %$* 535
these families, as jared and i have actually studied, work more and more hours and yet still have to make terrible choices every day. %$* 535
they have to choose, "do i pay for childcare or leave my little child alone? %$* 535
can i afford healthcare? %$* 535
can i afford to put anything aside in case i lose a job? %$* 535
" what our opponents are asking is to get rid of the minimum wage that keeps those families barely afloat today. %$* 535
how can they even consider that? %$* 535
i want to think beyond that family and what the implications of pulling out the rug under them would mean for the rest of us. %$* 535
first of all, let's think about the knowledge economy. %$* 535
our opponents have been talking about teens and letting them work for less money, but we're talking about a knowledge economy where we want to compete for high-wage jobs, and the people who are going to take those-- %$* 535
the children growing up in those families are the ones who are going to be the human capital of our society going forward. %$* 535
they're going to pay your and my social security. %$* 535
they're growing up in those families, earning those very low wages. %$* 535
they'd be worse off. %$* 535
there would be less to invest in those children. %$* 535
social mobility in the u.s.-- %$* 535
the u.s. used to be the home where, if you were brought-- %$* 535
born into a poor family, you could make good. %$* 535
that's less and less true. %$* 535
the american dream is under more and more threat. %$* 535
we're behind every country-- %$* 535
this is oecd data. %$* 535
we're behind every country except the u.k.now in terms of social mobility. %$* 535
we're behind france in social mobility. %$* 535
so do we really want to go backwards, get further away from the american dream? %$* 535
no, i don't think so. %$* 535
i think we want to restore the american dream, not turn this country into a dickensian nightmare. %$* 535
inequality, closely related to social mobility-- %$* 535
inequality is approaching record levels. %$* 535
and we think that half of the increase in inequality is a result of the falling minimum wage, half of the increase in inequality for those at the lower end. %$* 535
then there's the issue of our economic recovery-- %$* 535
our fragile economic recovery. %$* 535
if the minimum wage - - if abolishing the minimum wage had any effect at all, it would surely take money out of the economy. %$* 535
in fact, it would act as a reverse stimulus. %$* 535
so let's think very carefully before we go down this road as a society. %$* 535
i'd like to bring up women, as the only woman on this panel. %$* 535
over half of those who earn the minimum wage are women, and these women obviously already face disadvantages. %$* 535
if you look at the data, women are poorer than men at every age, and in old age the gap is tremendous because of the low wages that they earn. %$* 535
if we eliminate the minimum wage, this will especially hurt women. %$* 535
now, can we afford the minimum wage? %$* 535
it's a big question. %$* 535
yes, absolutely we can afford the minimum wage. %$* 535
as jared said, we've had it for over 75 years, hasn't hurt overall economic growth. %$* 535
the wealthiest americans are doing extremely well. %$* 535
corporate profitability is growing; as we know, the stock market just broke new records. %$* 535
but the families at the bottom end are not sharing in this increasing economic growth. %$* 535
we can afford to let them share a little bit of that. %$* 535
there's no evidence that the minimum wage costs jobs. %$* 535
there was a famous study two decades ago by alan krueger, now the chairman of the council of economic advisers, and berkeley's david card. %$* 535
they studied new jersey's fast food restaurants and they found a slight increase in employment as a result of the minimum wage being raised. %$* 535
and countless economists have poured in to try to refute this and they haven't been able to. %$* 535
they've done all kinds of studies. %$* 535
and as jared said, there's just no evidence that employment is hurt. %$* 535
and this applies to studies not just carried out in the u.s., but those in the united kingdom, australia, and other countries. %$* 535
we heard about hong kong. %$* 535
let's talk about hong kong. %$* 535
hong kong is a city-state of 7 million people, smaller than new york city, where i grew up. %$* 535
i don't think we want to gamble the united states' economic future on an experiment in hong kong. %$* 535
in china, however-- %$* 535
thanks. %$* 535
in china, however, the provinces actually have something like a minimum wage. %$* 535
it's a monthly floor. %$* 535
but in beijing, they actually have a minimum wage, and guess what? %$* 535
the central government in china just decided to raise that wage across the country so that it will be 40 percent of the average salary, which is higher than we have - - what we're talking about that we have right now. %$* 535
i just-- %$* 535
i just want you to think about the maid who makes your bed in the hotel when you're out of town, the person who serves you that salad when you go to the fast food restaurant at lunchtime. %$* 535
most of these people do not earn enough today to feed themselves, house their kids, and take care of their families. %$* 535
we-- %$* 535
they cannot afford to see their incomes fall. %$* 535
the moral argument is absolutely on our side, to not pull the rug out of low-income families. %$* 535
please vote no on abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 535
thank you. %$* 535
thank you, karen kornbluh. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is “abolish the minimum wage.” now we go on to round 2, and that's where the debaters address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here in washington d.c.we have two teams of two arguing for and against abolishing the minimum wage. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion, russell roberts and james dorn, have said that the minimum wage actually should be abolished. %$* 13
it should be abolished actually because it hurts the people that it's trying to help, that it makes workers artificially more expensive, and that that is something that kills jobs. %$* 13
the team arguing against abolishing the minimum wage-- %$* 13
in fact, they're saying that it should be raised, say that few policies have worked better as designed, over 75 years, than this one. %$* 13
and they say they are making the moral argument, that to abolish the minimum wage would pull the rug out from under millions of american families who are depending on it. %$* 13
i want to put a question to the side that is arguing to abolish the minimum wage in terms of impact. %$* 13
and either of you can take this question: if the minimum wage were abolished today, effective tomorrow, and employers could adjust wages, what do you think would happen? %$* 13
how many people would see their wages go down drastically and immediately? %$* 13
well, we can't answer that precisely. %$* 533
russell roberts. %$* 13
i certainly wouldn't abolish it tomorrow. %$* 533
i'd want to phase it out. %$* 533
but as i said earlier, about 3.5 million workers today earn the minimum wage or less. %$* 533
some of those, by the way, are-- %$* 533
about a million of them are in the food service business. %$* 533
and many of those make tips that boost their wages higher than what they're listed in the data. %$* 533
but it's about 3.5 million workers. %$* 533
so some of those would have lower wages. %$* 533
and the real question is, what else would employers do? %$* 533
what else would happen in the workplace if workers didn't have to be paid a legal minimum? %$* 533
and i think there'd be a lot more opportunity for those 3.4 million unemployed 16-to 24-year-olds that have had the rug pulled out from under them, because we have a policy in place that makes them expensive. %$* 533
and i think that's a terrible mistake. %$* 533
russell, in the very short term-- %$* 13
i'm just trying to-- %$* 13
i'm trying to hone in on the point that karen kornbluh is making, that she says it would pull the rug out from people who depend on it now. %$* 13
is that-- %$* 13
is that accurate? %$* 13
do you think that-- %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
i think you're talking about a longer-term process, where employers adjust, but in the short-term, would a lot of people be hurt very quickly? %$* 13
well, i don't know. %$* 533
i think some employers would take advantage of the change in the law to lower wages. %$* 533
and they would have lower income. %$* 533
the question is, what's the right way to help people who have low skills or who are struggling for all kinds of reasons, many of which are not their fault? %$* 533
we have a horrible school system. %$* 533
we ought to fix our school system instead of trying to help people through this artificial method. %$* 533
if the artificial method worked, i'd be-- %$* 533
it'd be great. %$* 533
it'd be great. %$* 533
when karen says we can afford it, we can afford it, this group, because we all make more than the minimum wage. %$* 533
and i would guess that most of the people in this room-- %$* 533
because 95 percent of the american workforce does earn more than the minimum wage, it would have very little effect on us. %$* 533
it's the people that we don't see, people who have the toughest time finding work, who are punished by this good intention-- %$* 533
well-intentioned law. %$* 533
all right. %$* 13
jared bernstein. %$* 13
yeah, i'm going to respond to that. %$* 534
first of all-- %$* 534
and i think we have a disagreement about the numbers. %$* 534
3.5 million hourly paid workers? %$* 534
that's correct. %$* 533
correct. %$* 534
you're leaving out at least 2 million salaried workers. %$* 534
salaried workers are not exempt from the minimum wage, so that number is wrong. %$* 534
here's-- %$* 534

so please welcome me-- %$* 13
please join me in welcoming to the stage mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
hi. %$* 13
so, just to begin-- %$* 13
to begin on this, bob, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you had recently been at an interesting dinner at yale. %$* 13
well, i was invited to a dinner at yale, and it's called “an invitation to a disinvitation.” and it was organized by a conservative group, and the people who were invited were a group of people who were disinvited to speak at other campuses, including, ayaan hirsi ali, condoleezza rice and christine lagarde. %$* 1
so, it touches very directly on the topic we're talking about. %$* 13
now, we're at george washington university. %$* 13
i want to make clear this is not-- %$* 13
we're not talking about george washington university per se in this debate. %$* 13
no. %$* 1
this is a much, much broader thing. %$* 1
we're just happy to be here because this is a splendid facility. %$* 1
and great students. %$* 13
terrific guys. %$* 1
and the-- %$* 13
talk to me a little bit about what's-- %$* 13
what are the tensions that are inherent in this topic that we're talking about, about intellectual diversity. %$* 13
well, i think intelligence squared was sort of started with the idea that you want to hear both sides of arguments. %$* 1
you want them-- %$* 1
the truth comes from the competition of ideas. %$* 1
and that critical thinking skills involve listening to both sides of-- %$* 1
of ideas before you formulate an opinion. %$* 1
and that's what we're hoping that the audience is going to do here tonight. %$* 1
and yet we do set limits. %$* 13
we set – we have rules and-- %$* 13
we certainly do, and our goal is civil discourse. %$* 1
and i underline "civil." and i think that campus speech codes, for example, are trying to assert a degree of civility. %$* 1
and the question is, are they doing that, or are they, in a sense, squelching free speech? %$* 1
campus speech codes being one of the topics that i suspect will be touched on tonight. %$* 1
and i think both sides are going to stipulate probably that by and large, at most american universities, most of the faculty is liberal. %$* 13
and i wonder, does that, all by itself, mean, well, there's no debate here if it's through the faculty? %$* 13
well, i don't think so. %$* 1
and i think anybody in the audience that’s a parent would know that people of college age do not believe what their elders tell them. %$* 1
oh, so it may not be relevant. %$* 13
it may not be relevant. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
well, we'll see. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
let's see what we hear from our debaters, and let's welcome them all to the stage. %$* 13
and thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 13
he was meant to shake your hand, so i'm going to do it. %$* 13
come on in. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
hi. %$* 13
see what happens when we get out of new york? %$* 13
we lose all the cues. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so one more time to remind you that we're-- %$* 13
we're going to go for about an hour and a half. %$* 13
and we ultimately turn into an hour- long radio broadcast and podcast. %$* 13
and hearing from you is critical, so that-- %$* 13
this is not like a presidential debate. %$* 13
we absolutely are delighted to hear your response to the things you're hearing. %$* 13
it's fine to applaud points you like or to chuckle at jokes you like. %$* 13
we discourage hissing and booing, and we really do discourage hissing and booing. %$* 13
we want to keep it in a positive way. %$* 13
but that does not mean that you have to remain silent throughout. %$* 13
and in a way, it helps the debaters know how they're doing, and it totally helps the people at home know that you're here. %$* 13
so, we're going to launch now. %$* 13
and to do that, i'd like to ask for one more round of your spontaneous applause to get us launched. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
this is intelligence squared u.s.it happened to the director of the cia, it happened to the head of the international monetary fund. %$* 13
it happened to comedian bill maher. %$* 13
all of these people within the past few years, and several others, were offered honorary degrees or chances to speak at universities and then protesters from the left demanded that those offers be rescinded and the speeches canceled. %$* 13
and in some cases, that actually did happen. %$* 13
and what was that? %$* 13
was that censorship, or was that the left also exercising its right of free expression? %$* 13
and are conservatives, when given the chance, going to do exactly the same thing? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus," a debate from intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at george washington university in washington, d.c.we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, arguing for and against this motion, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience here at the jack morton auditorium will vote to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
our motion is this, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus," and here to argue in support of that motion, please welcome greg lukianoff. %$* 13
greg, welcome. %$* 13
and you are president of the foundation for individual rights and education, that is fire, and you were the inaugural recipient of the playboy foundation's freedom of expression award. %$* 13
the wall street journal described you as "born to fight college censorship" in part because of, quote, "your unruly red hair," fire again. %$* 13
but my question is this. %$* 13
you know, it's-- %$* 13
for those who are listening who can't see your hair, how are they going to know how fiery you are? %$* 13
i-- %$* 257
it's funny. %$* 257
i actually think of myself as fairly mild-mannered. %$* 257
i mean, besides free speech, which i do get very worked up about, i mostly only get worked about how bad the "star wars" prequels were, the canceling of "firefly," and, of course, that people really don't appreciate beyoncé enough. %$* 257
all right, thank you, greg lukianoff. %$* 13
and tell us, who are you debating side-by-side-- %$* 13
who's your partner? %$* 13
the fabulous kirsten powers. %$* 257
ladies and gentlemen, kirsten powers. %$* 13
kirsten, you are also arguing for the motion, "liberals are stifling diversity on campus." you began your career in the clinton administration. %$* 13
you became a deputy assistant u.s.trade representative. %$* 13
you served as a consultant to the new york state democratic party. %$* 13
but you have a book coming out now, "the silencing: how the left is killing free speech," and you're on fox news. %$* 13
so, our question is, do your friends from the old days still talk to you anymore? %$* 13
they do. %$* 258
they call me up usually to tell me they saw me-- %$* 258
you know, cheer me on for brawling with bill o'reilly. %$* 258
and they always claim that they accidentally saw fox news when they were flipping through the channels. %$* 258
yeah, of course it was an accident. %$* 13
all right, that's our team arguing for the motion, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." %$* 13
and we also have a team arguing against the motion, two debaters, first, please, let's welcome angus johnston. %$* 13
angus, you founded the website, studentactivism.net. %$* 13
you are-- %$* 13
you're an historian of student activism and student life. %$* 13
you teach at the city university of new york. %$* 13
you yourself were an activist as an undergraduate. %$* 13
you took part in sit-ins and in demonstrations. %$* 13
in your own words, you yelled and screamed plenty of times and you even got arrested once for something like really exciting. %$* 13
actually, i was sitting quietly in a student lounge discussing blood donation policy. %$* 259
oh, you were-- %$* 13
that was radical. %$* 13
angus johnston, thanks very much. %$* 13
and who is your partner? %$* 13
the incredibly erudite jeremy mayer. %$* 259
ladies and gentlemen, jeremy mayer. %$* 13
jeremy, you are also arguing against this motion that "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." you are an associate professor at george mason university. %$* 13
you are coauthor of the book, "closed minds? %$* 13
politics and ideology in american universities." a new york times article cited your book's findings, and in it you are quoted as saying that, "when it comes to shaping a young person's political views," quote, "professors are among the least influential." so, as a college professor, how does that make you feel? %$* 13
hey, it makes me feel pretty good. %$* 260
a college professor should not tell you what to think. %$* 260
he should give you-- %$* 260
he or she should give you the tools to think for yourself. %$* 260
and debaters as well. %$* 13
all right, ladies and gentlemen, that's the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a clash of ideas, and you, our live audience at the jack morton auditorium, will be serving as our judges. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before you've heard the arguments and once again after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
and the teams whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
it's the difference between the two votes. %$* 13
let's get the first vote registered. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, you'll see a set of numbers. %$* 13
just pay attention to one, two, and three. %$* 13
those are the only ones that are active. %$* 13
look at the motion, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
if you made a mistake, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
the other keys are not live. %$* 13
and we'll lock it out in just a second while i pick up this piece of paper. %$* 13
i'll pretend i didn't drop it. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 13
that did not happen. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so, remember how you voted. %$* 13
we've locked it out. %$* 13
remember how you voted. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to vote after you've heard the arguments, and again, it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round 1.our motion is this: liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
opening rounds. %$* 13
opening statements in the opening round are six minutes each. %$* 13
and here to make his opening statement in support of the motion, greg lukianoff. %$* 13
he is president of the foundation for individual rights in education and he was the inaugural recipient of the playboy foundation's freedom of expression award. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome greg lukianoff. %$* 13
let me start by whisking you back to a magical time-- %$* 257
2001.a conservative would have dismissed me as a liberal cliché. %$* 257
i was a floppy-haired, burning man regular, san francisc-ite who turned down big law salaries to work for social justice. %$* 257
i had worked in refugee camps in eastern europe, for an environmental justice mentoring program in d.c., and for the aclu of northern california. %$* 257
and most of all, i loved the first amendment, the quintessential liberal cause-- %$* 257
or so i thought. %$* 257
2001 was also the year i started working at fire, which proudly defends speech and academic freedom for speakers of any political stripe. %$* 257
as soon as i started at fire, however, i was inundated with hundreds of pleas for help. %$* 257
it wasn't long before i learned this unfortunate truth: if you're going to be censored on the modern college campus for your opinion, chances are you're going to be censored by the left. %$* 257
and this is what we mean by the left, and most americans mean when we say "liberal" these days, either people on the left side of the political spectrum or people who self-identify as liberals, and people to their left. %$* 257
i have been-- %$* 257
i have seen so many crazy examples of politically- correct censorship. %$* 257
a student at indiana punished just for publicly reading a book, a sorority sister forced to publicly repent for insensitivity for a taco tuesday event, and yale students banned from calling harvard students "sissies" on a t-shirt, which was a quote from f.scott fitzgerald by the way. %$* 257
this is heartbreaking to me and my teammate, since both of us consider ourselves liberals. %$* 257
of course there are many, quote, good liberals out there who still support free speech, both on and off campus. %$* 257
these include former aclu president nadine strossen, the nation's michelle goldberg, renowned first amendment attorney floyd abrams, and many more. %$* 257
but one thing all of these liberals have in common is that they also believe that the campus liberals have become distressingly intolerant of dissent. %$* 257
take any hot topic in america today and i can point you to examples of students and faculty members getting in trouble for being on the conservative side of the issue. %$* 257
take abortion. %$* 257
while fire has proudly supported the free speech rights of pro-choice students, we are far more likely to have to come to the defense of pro-life students. %$* 257
how bad is it? %$* 257
at northern kentucky university, a professor actually led her students to destroy a pro-life display. %$* 257
the display was only dozens of little white crosses to protest roe v.wade. %$* 257
at dartmouth, a similar pro-life display-- %$* 257
this time involving tiny american flags, was considered so offensive that another student ran it over with his car. %$* 257
that reckless censor-- %$* 257
have you any guess about what his politics were? %$* 257
he had a coexist sticker on the back of his car. %$* 257
or take immigration. %$* 257
at ucla, a student group faced ferocious protest and a massive fine when they simply attempted to invite someone to come to campus to debate against their pro-immigration stance. %$* 257
and though i'm an atheist, i have been horrified by repeated attempts to censor campus evangelicals. %$* 257
kirsten will tell you more about those cases. %$* 257
last year, campus liberals made national headlines for demanding that speakers they did not like be disinvited from campuses across the country. %$* 257
this problem has been growing for years. %$* 257
according to extensive research by fire, if you're going to face a disinvitation push arising from campus, it's about three times as likely it's going to come from your left. %$* 257
this is especially shocking when you consider how rare it is for a conservative to be invited in the first place. %$* 257
last year's commencement season saw 25 democratic political figures speech-- %$* 257
speak at the commencements of 60 of america's top universities. %$* 257
and how many republicans were invited to speak? %$* 257
zero. %$* 257
and this statistic comes from nate silver's decidedly non-conservative fivethirtyeight website. %$* 257
some conservatives were invited to talk at universities outside the top 60, including rutgers. %$* 257
however, even there former secretary of state condoleezza rice bowed out after months of pressure from faculty and students. %$* 257
even mild satire from conservatives isn't tolerated. %$* 257
take the case of omar mahmoud, a muslim conservative at the university of michigan. %$* 257
when this past december, he wrote a satirical column poking fun at micro aggressions and privilege theory-- %$* 257
very mild. %$* 257
he was not only fired from the student newspaper, but his dorm room door was vandalized. %$* 257
this prompted famous liberal writer jonathan chait to criticize the rise of a new wave of political correctness. %$* 257
if angus and jeremy concede that there is a problem with free speech on campus, they may blame the massive corporatized modern university. %$* 257
and on this we agree. %$* 257
much of the censorship does come from out-of-control administrators. %$* 257
however, we must understand that liberals so thoroughly dominate the current academy, as kirsten will show, that if they were serious about freedom of speech on campus, this kind of administrative outer-- %$* 257
overreach would not be possible despite liberal dominance on campus or maybe because of it. %$* 257
55 percent of over 400 colleges surveyed last year maintain wildly unconstitutional speech codes while only 4 percent maintain codes that fully meet first amendment standards. %$* 257
and this in spite of nearly three dozen lawsuits against politically correct speech codes since 1989, successful lawsuits. %$* 257
and we can't forget that the tools that are most often to silence dissent on campus are the brain children of professors, including katherine mckinnon, mary matsuda and richard delgado, all of whom were liberal leaders of the speech code movement in the 1980s. %$* 257
though it gives me no joy to say it, you must vote in favor of the motion, yes, liberals do stifle intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 257
thank you. %$* 257
thank you, greg lukianoff. %$* 13
and that is our motion: liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
and here to argue against this motion, jeremy mayer. %$* 13
he is an associate professor in the school of policy, government and international affairs at george mason university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeremy mayer. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 260
the picture that greg drew is a common one. %$* 260
it is the conservative picture of the modern university. %$* 260
perhaps best summarized by former pennsylvania senator rick santorum who called universities "indoctrination mills." in this picture, we are-- %$* 260
higher education is infused with an overly liberal professoriate, biased classrooms and stifled campus debate. %$* 260
if this picture is true, it is indeed very serious. %$* 260
if it is an accurate portrait of higher education in america, then we should all be alarmed, and we should all donate money to greg's group. %$* 260
is it, though? %$* 260
i will handle those first two, are professors liberal? %$* 260
and why? %$* 260
is the classroom a biased place? %$* 260
and mostly leave the third to angus. %$* 260
so, are professors liberal? %$* 260
well, yes. %$* 260
when we did the research, a national random sample survey for our book, we found that 61 percent of college professors are left or liberal. %$* 260
but this is nothing new. %$* 260
the very first time we looked at college professors in a structured survey in 1933, we found almost the same number. %$* 260
so, it isn't like the '60s: radicals all went into faculty positions and moved young minds to the left. %$* 260
so, why-- %$* 260
what explains this? %$* 260
well, the conservative explanation for the overwhelming liberal campus is simple: conservatives are squeezed out of grad school, convinced that their ideas aren't worthy of a phd. %$* 260
and those few that escape this thought police then find it very hard to get a job because liberals discriminate and won’t hire conservatives. %$* 260
and then those few conservatives that get through this gauntlet are denied tenure by bitter liberal colleagues. %$* 260
this simply is not so. %$* 260
when we surveyed faculty members, 85 percent argued that ideology played no role in tenure in their department. %$* 260
and this was true of 87 percent of conservatives we surveyed, so-- %$* 260
of the very conservative. %$* 260
so, it is not the case that conservatives need not apply for jobs. %$* 260
why aren't there more conservative professors to fight the good fight? %$* 260
well, the first answer i’d give you is money. %$* 260
if you are someone who believes in the market uber alles, you might want to make more than $29.5k, which is what i made my first year as a young college professor in 1996. %$* 260
if you work four years for a phd like i did, you might think you deserve something better. %$* 260
that's what we got. %$* 260
so, i think the market keeps conservatives from wanting to be in the academy. %$* 260
i also think there's a pocketbook issue here. %$* 260
professors depend on two sources of government for their income. %$* 260
one is those many professors like myself who work for state government. %$* 260
if conservatives win, you may not get a raise for four years. %$* 260
and a lot of professors also work on federal grants. %$* 260
the republican party is not the republican party of 1955, which was very supportive of higher education. %$* 260
it is a party that is devoted to cutting government spending. %$* 260
we aren't surprised when oil executives vote republican. %$* 260
it's in their economic interest. %$* 260
the same is true for college professors. %$* 260
we also have seen the conservative movement have a hostility to science which it didn't have 40 years ago. %$* 260
so, in our survey, we found, contrary to earlier ones, that natural science professors were moving to the left. %$* 260
well, if a party attacks evolution, you're going to lose a lot of natural and social scientists because we happen to believe in the scientific method. %$* 260
it's good politics for republicans. %$* 260
i give them that. %$* 260
there's a lot more people who think the world was created in seven days than people with phds. %$* 260
so it's a good move, but it hurts them on college campuses. %$* 260
there's also another thing that we found is conservatives on college campuses are pretty much like other professors. %$* 260
they're also very, very pro gay rights. %$* 260
while one party has embraced that social movement, the other party is fairly fervently against it. %$* 260
so, that is again moving professors away from any tendencies to be republican or conservative. %$* 260
finally, an anti-intellectualism is occupying certain wings of the republican party. %$* 260
it used to be that that was more the democrats that were anti- intellectual. %$* 260
anyone remember george curly wallace? %$* 260
when george wallace ran for president as an independent after being a democrat, he almost got no faculties’ support-- %$* 260
in '68. %$* 260
the inheritors of the wallace movement today are in the republican party. %$* 260
it is that kind of anti-intellectualism that turns off college professors. %$* 260
so, i don't think that college professors are becoming liberal out of a viewpoint discrimination. %$* 260
is the classroom biased against conservatives? %$* 260
i would argue no, that if you ask students, do you feel that your viewpoints aren't welcome on your college campus? %$* 260
in survey after survey, the majority of students say no. %$* 260
so, i think this portrait of an overly liberal campus can be discredited with greg's own research, that in his work where he identified the 12 worst campuses in 2013, and he said, "these are examples of liberal viewpoint discrimination, conservatives being squelched." well, in fact, of the 12, three were nonpolitical, entirely conservative, small “c” conservative administrators just saying, “oh, i don't want people talking about sex on my campus. %$* 260
we might lose donations.” three of them were conservatives squelching liberals. %$* 260
and finally, there were four of the classic where liberals were being-- %$* 260
were squelching conservatives. %$* 260
there is a place in this very city where i would not be allowed to speak on any topic at all. %$* 260
it's catholic university. %$* 260
catholic university, like many conservative campuses, is very explicit about not allowing liberals to speak. %$* 260
i'm not exactly a liberal, but i am pro choice. %$* 260
catholic university has an official policy: no one who has ever publicly advocated for the right to abortion is allowed to speak. %$* 260
yep. %$* 260
thank you. %$* 260
jeremy mayer, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
yep. %$* 260
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 260
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is “liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus.” you've heard the first two debaters, and now onto the third. %$* 13
let's welcome to the lecturn kirsten powers. %$* 13
she is a columnist for usa today and the daily beast, a network contributor on the fox news channel, where she is also a panelist on the program, "outnumbered." ladies and gentlemen, kirsten powers. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 258
thanks to intelligence squared for doing a debate on such an important topic. %$* 258
and i'm always happy to be anywhere where bill o'reilly can't interrupt me, so i'm happy to be here. %$* 258
our opponents are telling you that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on campuses. %$* 258
sadly, this could not be further from the truth. %$* 258
a perfect example of this is a 2013 case that happened at the university of alaska, fairbanks, where i'm from. %$* 258
my parents were professors there. %$* 258
a feminist professor filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against the student university-- %$* 258
the campus university there-- %$* 258
because of an april fool’s day issue of an article that was mildly mocking feminism. %$* 258
the professor filed another complaint after the newspaper published an article that was critical of hate speech. %$* 258
the university's repeated investigations dragged on for almost nine months and-- %$* 258
and it only really ended when fire had intervened and informed them they were violating the first amendment. %$* 258
ironically, the editor-in-chief, who wrote this article, was herself a feminist and thought she was doing a very mild, mocking, april fool’s day story. %$* 258
and she told fire that the chilling investigation that was launched by the university of alaska prevented her from publishing stories on important issues, including sexual assault. %$* 258
recently, at milwaukee's marquette university, a political science professor there, john mcadams, blogged about an exchange where a marquette philosophy professor had told a student that debating gay marriage in class was, quote, "not appropriate and homophobic."for this, marquette suspended the professor, mcadams, who blogged about it, banned him from campus, and they are now in the process of trying to revoke his tenure. %$* 258
greg and i both support gay marriage, but this is an extremely chilling way for marquette to handle this issue. %$* 258
as jeremy acknowledged, the decks are stacked against those who express non-liberal views on campuses. %$* 258
and i would just point out, to the point that campuses have always been liberal, liberals are very-- %$* 258
liberals-- %$* 258
the liberals in the past actually supported free speech, and i think that would be the big difference of today, is that the liberals that we're talking about today are enacting very hostile policies against free speech. %$* 258
and so there's a big difference. %$* 258
they may be voting for the same people, but they are behaving in a very different way. %$* 258
and many studies will back up the fact that there are vastly more liberals on campuses. %$* 258
there was one study that found that 72 percent of college professors identify as liberal, while only 15 percent identify as conservative. %$* 258
it's gotten so bad that several prominent social psychologists have written an article recently arguing that the field of psychology is being badly hurt by the lack of political diversity. %$* 258
one of the papers-- %$* 258
and, by the way, none of them are conservatives who wrote this-- %$* 258
one of the paper's authors is nyu professor jonathan haidt. %$* 258
at a 2011 social psychologist symposium, he asked the audience to show hands for their political leanings. %$* 258
out of a thousand people only three raised their hands to say that they were conservative. %$* 258
and haidt points out that, of course, there were more conservatives in the audience-- %$* 258
that can't be the actual ratio-- %$* 258
but they were too afraid to identify themselves, which speaks for itself. %$* 258
he explained that this gross political and ideological disparity is evidence of a, quote, "tribal moral community that actively discourages conservatives from entering."he explained that there were-- %$* 258
in preparing for his speech, he wanted to talk to some non-liberal graduate students. %$* 258
he was able to only identify two in the-- %$* 258
of social psychology graduate students, and that he said that he-- %$* 258
they reminded him of closeted gays from the 1980s. %$* 258
and he referred to them as "closeted conservatives" because they were-- %$* 258
they felt that they were forced to hide their identities and-- %$* 258
from their colleagues and from their professors, and it really affected the research that they did. %$* 258
and so haidt argued that more ideological diversity would lead to, quote, "better science and freer thinking." the ideological slant, it's not just a passive preference. %$* 258
during the 2012 election, 96 percent, which is almost 100 percent as we all know, of political contributions from ivy league faculty and staff went to the obama campaign. %$* 258
and during the 2004 election, professors donated $19 to john kerry's campaign for every dollar that went to george bush. %$* 258
and as sociologist neil gross has pointed out, our colleges and our universities are one- party campuses. %$* 258
last year at the university of california at santa barbara, one of the worst cases probably that we'll talk about tonight, a feminist professor's study-- %$* 258
she was found guilty of grand theft, vandalism, and battery after a physical altercation in which she stole and destroyed a 16-year-old pro-life demonstrator's sign. %$* 258
the professor claimed she was triggered by the poster's graphic images, called the demonstrators "terrorists," and told police she had a moral right to her behavior and was just setting a good example. %$* 258
she still has a job and was basically defended by scores of professors. %$* 258
we've also seen discrimination against christian groups on campuses – it’s getting much worse at vanderbilt. %$* 258
fourteen campus groups lost their organizational status in 2012 because they wanted to choose their own leaders based on religious belief. %$* 258
and there are just many more campus fellowship groups from university of-- %$* 258
state university of new york or the cal state system who've lost-- %$* 258
have been driven off campus. %$* 258
and, you know, harvard professor and former obama administration appointee cass sunstein has warned that when a group becomes ideologically homogenous, it tends to drift farther and farther in that direction and become more hostile to outsiders. %$* 258
but it's reason %$* 258
yep. %$* 258
kirsten powers, i'm sorry, your-- %$* 13
but it's reason %$* 258
your time is up. %$* 13
yep. %$* 258
okay, thank you very much, kirsten powers. %$* 13
and our motion is, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." and here to argue against this motion in his opening statement, angus johnston. %$* 13
he teaches history at city university of new york and is founder of the website, studentactivisim.net. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, angus johnston. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 259
my adversaries have made some really cogent points this evening, and so as an actual campus leftist, i look forward to denouncing them as bigots. %$* 259
but before i do that, i'd like to take a step back and talk a little bit about the campus. %$* 259
what the actual, average american campus is like today. %$* 259
the american campus today, as it has been in the past, is a site of robust and passionate debate. %$* 259
and that's true not only because it's a place of learning, but also because it is a haven for young people. %$* 259
and the reality is that most of us, at some point in our lives, give up on debating people we profoundly disagree with. %$* 259
we decide that it's too hard, it's too uncomfortable, it doesn't usually work. %$* 259
and so, we give up. %$* 259
but college students haven't given up yet. %$* 259
and so, they argue, incessantly and angrily. %$* 259
but here's the thing. %$* 259
in my experience, on campuses across the country-- %$* 259
and this is backed up by my opponent's own data-- %$* 259
where free speech is curtailed on campus, it's overwhelmingly not by students or campus liberals, but by administrators who are motivated not by ideology, but by opposition to disruptiveness and clamor. %$* 259
a perfect example of this is a case that many critics of campus leftism and campus liberalism have talked about-- %$* 259
the case of robert birgeneau, the former chancellor of the university of california berkeley, who, as berkeley chancellor, presided over the arrests of dozens of peaceful, non-violent student protestors on multiple occasions, including one occasion in 2011, where students who were demonstrating peacefully were beaten viciously by campus police with batons. %$* 259
after he stepped down as berkeley's chancellor, birgeneau was invited to give a commencement address at haverford college in pennsylvania. %$* 259
and some haverford students were understandably not so happy about this. %$* 259
so, what did they do? %$* 259
did they burn down the building? %$* 259
did they lock him out? %$* 259
did they beat him with batons? %$* 259
no. %$* 259
they did none of those things. %$* 259
what they did is write a letter. %$* 259
they wrote a long letter expressing their concerns in which they offered suggestions for how he could repair the harm that he had done to civil liberties at berkley. %$* 259
and they urged-- %$* 259
that was their word-- %$* 259
"urged" him-- %$* 259
to-- %$* 259
as they put it, "confront the issues before you." if he didn't do that, they said, they would ask the college to withdraw his invitation, a request that they had no power to enforce. %$* 259
in a two-line reply, birgeneau said that he would not respond to what he called their “violent verbal attacks." period. %$* 259
he wouldn't meet with them. %$* 259
he wouldn't respond to the claims that they had made. %$* 259
he wouldn't debate them. %$* 259
and in fact, he wouldn't even come to their campus. %$* 259
he withdrew his decision to come and speak at their commencement. %$* 259
now, fire has written about this incident many times. %$* 259
op-ed writers all over the country have written about this incident. %$* 259
and every time they do, birgeneau-- %$* 259
an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protestors-- %$* 259
is portrayed as a free speech martyr. %$* 259
well, the students who had just wanted to talk to him about that-- %$* 259
are portrayed as his oppressors. %$* 259
and i say that that is absolutely wrong. %$* 259
i say that is absolutely backwards. %$* 259
now, i'm not asking you to embrace every argument made by every member of the campus left, because frankly, some of their arguments are really bad arguments. %$* 259
but speech that nobody opposes is not speech that needs protecting. %$* 259
and there's a recurring tactic that we see in critics of the campus left in which students who are engaging in free speech are condemned as violent or condemned as censors. %$* 259
and you know, hyperbole is free speech, whether it's the hyperbole of students calling a speaker who said something unfortunate a racist or the hyperbole of an administrator calling a polite letter a violent attack. %$* 259
demonizing your opponents is free speech. %$* 259
but so is refusing to demonize them. %$* 259
and that's what i'm asking you to do today. %$* 259
i want you to vote against this motion, because it's not liberals who are stifling free speech on the american campus, but bureaucrats. %$* 259
bureaucrats who are scared by the rowdy, messy vitality of the marketplace of ideals-- %$* 259
ideas. %$* 259
so, what i'm asking you to do here is to stand up for free speech on campus-- %$* 259
the freedom of speech of the left and the right and the center by voting against this ill-conceived and prejudicial motion. %$* 259
and i'd just like to close by saying one thing. %$* 259
a few days ago we lost a champion of speech and debate and dialogue in this country, david carr, who wrote for the new york times. %$* 259
and on the stage at the intelligence squared debates a couple years ago, he said something that i would just like to quote to you now. %$* 259
he said, "i urge you to vote against, against, against this motion which is per se dumb." thank you. %$* 259
thank you, angus johnston. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
they're all wearing black so that you don't see this happening. %$* 13
it's working, right? %$* 13
yeah? %$* 13
okay, round of applause for these guys. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here at george washington university. %$* 13
the team arguing for this motion, kirsten powers and greg lukianoff, we've heard them argue that socially conservative views are the ones that are most being suppressed on america's campuses, that they are the-- %$* 13
the censorship is three times as more likely to come from the left. %$* 13
they say is that the decks are stacked because the high rate of liberal representation in faculty and administration, and they were the ones who drew up the speech codes that are affecting speech. %$* 13
that's certain groups in particular, not just politically conservative groups, but evangelical groups also are having their views suppressed through a sort of social pressure as well as enforcement of these speech codes that are aimed to silence them. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, angus johnston and jeremy mayer, they're risking a rather nuanced response to this. %$* 13
they're conceding that in fact the campuses are by and large overwhelmingly liberal in terms of their faculty makeup. %$* 13
61 percent, they cite. %$* 13
but they also are making the argument that conservatives also, when they have the opportunity, on campuses that are overwhelmingly conservative, also try to suppress speech. %$* 13
they make the strong argument that criticism in itself is not censorship that the tilt towards liberal faculty has to do with self-selection among conservatives. %$* 13
they don't particularly want to go work in these places and that, by and large, there are debates still on campuses. %$* 13
there's just not that much stifling going on altogether. %$* 13
i want to take this question to the side arguing against the motion, to angus johnston and jeremy mayer. %$* 13
your opponents are saying that-- %$* 13
let's talk about speech codes, and i think we all know what those are, certain rules enforced on some campuses that there are certain topics that cannot be discussed, and certainly, certain words, formulations in language that cannot be used. %$* 13
and your opponents are making the argument against your argument that this is a big corporate thing, that it's affecting both sides, that the roots of these speech codes, their actual content was drawn up-- %$* 13
were drawn up by liberals to satisfy their political agendas, and their sensibilities, and they've stayed in place. %$* 13
and therefore, that-- %$* 13
they feel nails their argument that it's a liberal dominance over conservative thought because of who got to write up these codes in the first place. %$* 13
which one would like to take it? %$* 13
angus johnston? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 259
i think there are a few things that need to be said in response to that. %$* 259
first is, the folks who draw up these speech codes are not intending to impose ideological conformity. %$* 259
i just want to say, i know that i asked the question-- %$* 13
oh, yeah, sorry. %$* 259
you need to persuade these people. %$* 13
i will do that. %$* 259
that's right, you are-- %$* 259
you are my actual audience as well as "the" audience. %$* 259
so, okay, so the folks who have drawn up these speech codes are for the most part not intending to impose ideological conformity. %$* 259
they are trying to keep trustees happy, they are trying to keep alumni happy. %$* 259
they are trying to avoid having parents feel like their kids who they think of as still children are living in a den of iniquity. %$* 259
and so there is certainly a tremendous amount of pressure from the top to keep things calm on the campus. %$* 259
but that's a very different thing than an attempt to impose ideological conformity. %$* 259
and in fact, in the 2015 speech code report that fire just produced, they cite that the setting aside speech codes which are not currently being enforced, they cite 15 examples of freedom of speech violations and 12 of those are nonideological, things like people getting-- %$* 259
students getting written up for passing out constitutions on campus. %$* 259
that's not anti- conservative. %$* 259
let's let-- %$* 13
that’s anti-free speech. %$* 259
your opponents respond to it. %$* 13
who would like to take that? %$* 13
i'll-- %$* 257
i think i can start with that. %$* 257
greg lukianoff. %$* 13
i mean, it was interesting to have your own research sort of cited, because when we watch how these codes are written, you know, as i said, they came from liberal thinkers, they came from the catherine mackinnons. %$* 257
they are used disproportionally against conservative points of view consistently. %$* 257
and the idea that, yes, absolutely, administrators are largely the big problem, and they have been, and i'd be willing to say that. %$* 257
but the administrators themselves lean overwhelmingly left. %$* 257
it's 96 percent donations to the obama campaign came from-- %$* 257
when you take staff and faculty together. %$* 257

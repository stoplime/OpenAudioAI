so we know people had their policies outright canceled. %$* 295
we know many millions more had them changed in substantive ways, where it's no longer affordable to them. %$* 295
i have a question from twitter, from jerry weinstein or weinstein-- %$* 13
or weinstein or weinstein. %$* 13
no, it's two i-- %$* 13
e-i-e-i-- %$* 13
jerry weinstein he asks to the side that is opposing the aca, which is actually the side arguing for our motion that obamacare is now beyond rescue-- %$* 13
"tell us, how successful was the romney care law in massachusetts and where is that program now? %$* 13
well, it's-- %$* 300
megan mcardle. %$* 13
in some ways it lowered the number of the uninsured. %$* 300
it did it in its first year, which i'm not clear we're doing now. %$* 300
but in other ways, it didn't do what it was expecting to do. %$* 300
for example, they had expected to really lower the rate of uncompensated care, which was something that you hear a lot about. %$* 300
and they did lower it somewhat, but it came in at only about 40 percent lower than the projections-- %$* 300
instead of the 100 percent lower than they’d basically been expecting. %$* 300
costs are still going up. %$* 300
medical bankruptcies don't seem to have abated nearly as much as you would think, given how much insurance-- %$* 300
you know, they've now-- %$* 300
they're now the-- %$* 300
by far the lowest rate of uninsured people in the nation. %$* 300
but massachusetts is also a little bit hard to compare to the rest of the country. %$* 300
they already had the lowest rate of uninsured people in the country before they started this. %$* 300
they've got a weird mix of employers-- %$* 300
you know, a lot more employer-based insurance than you're going to get in texas. %$* 300
there's many fewer illegal immigrants-- %$* 300
and even legal immigrants, which is one of the big areas where you see uninsured people for kind of understandable reasons-- %$* 300
go ahead, %$* 13
and we also-- %$* 295
we've seen costs go up in massachusetts. %$* 295
and massachusetts was a market that was saturated with providers. %$* 295
so it was easy to get leverage on them and burn them down. %$* 295
it's going to be a little harder to do that in obamacare, but i think they'll get there. %$* 295
would this side like to take the massachusetts question. %$* 13
i don't think that they need you to make your point-- %$* 13
so in the front row there. %$* 13
oh, no, i-- %$* 18
oh, jonathan's going to-- %$* 13
i see-- %$* 13
i would like to, actually. %$* 301
there's a huge amount of data. %$* 301
it contradicts what the others are trying to say. %$* 301
let me cite one. %$* 301
two urban institute researchers published a study finding that the number of adults reporting that they skipped care because of high costs in massachusetts fell 17 percent to 11 percent for the first two years of the law. %$* 301
so i think of all the things it's trying to do, is-- %$* 301
quit-- %$* 301
stop people who can't get healthcare because they can't afford it. %$* 301
that was the main goal of the law and it succeeded %$* 301
yeah, you can stand up %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm erica. %$* 19
i'm just wondering what aspects off the law were put into effect that lowered costs by 2012 of overall health insurance. %$* 19
jonathan, sounds like it's yours to-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 302
oh-- %$* 302
you-- %$* 302
there are a number of things. %$* 302
and one of those is getting people into care so they don't have-- %$* 302
you could go ahead-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 301
there were a lot of cost reforms in the way that hospitals were compensated, that happened before 2012, right? %$* 301
so, instead of paying people based on more care-- %$* 301
the more medicine you perform, the more money you get-- %$* 301
it changed the model where people get paid based on providing quality of care and actually in measurable ways of improving patients health. %$* 301
so, one way is it penalized hospitals that have high rates of infections. %$* 301
because previously, hospitals-- %$* 301
if your patients get an infection, that's a bonus for you. %$* 301
they have to go back in the hospital and get treated again. %$* 301
and you make more money. %$* 301
so, instead the law changed and said, "no, we're going to penalize you if you have a high rate of infections.” and the rate of infection has actually fallen. %$* 301
there's a wide series of reforms like this changed the cost structure of american medicine. %$* 301
and i think a lot of researchers have looked at this and concluded they're actually working on changing the cost model and making people try to provide quality instead of just more and more care for more and more money. %$* 301
jonathan-- %$* 13
looks like your opponents want to challenge that? %$* 13
so, there's a lot of-- %$* 300
megan mcardle. %$* 13
there's a lot of changes in the law that were supposed to control coststhere are some that take effect immediately, like hospital remission. %$* 300
but that was only in medicare. %$* 300
and the cost reductions have been occurring across the board, not just in medicare, a recent paper at brookings suggests it's probably due to a combination of the recession and technological slowdown, we haven't had a lot of innovation for whatever reason in the last few years. %$* 300
going forward, there are things like accountable care organizations that think they're not looking as great as they thought that they were. %$* 300
other issues with electronic medical records, also not looking as great as we had hoped. %$* 300
and some medicare pilot programs. %$* 300
and eventually, the comparative effectiveness for slow medicare costs and it doesn't come down on its own. %$* 300
but all-- %$* 300
most of that stuff hasn't really-- %$* 300
either hasn't finished being implemented or isn't expected to return dividends or is going to be started being implemented this year. %$* 300
most of the cost control provisions in this law form transfer risk to providers. %$* 295
that's how the law seeks to control cost. %$* 295
that's what accountable peer organizations bundle payment share savings. %$* 295
it's all forms of capitation, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. %$* 295
that's why doctors are selling them back to hospitals, so they can form larger entities and take that capitated risk. %$* 295
if you think that's a good idea, then you're more than welcome. %$* 295
all right question right there? %$* 13
we’ll get a mic to you. %$* 13
hi, i'm dave. %$* 18
thank you so much, intelligence squared, and thank you to the debaters. %$* 18
2.7 million people under the age of 30 out of seven million enrollees is what hinges obamacare's success. %$* 18
social security and medicare, $66 trillion in deficits, what provisions decide against-- %$* 18
what provisions in the law ensure obamacare does not result in financial failure like social security and medicare when it hinges on taking from the young to get to the old when the demographics clearly suggest this is unsustainable. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
and it's just sort of a big philosophical question which wraps up everything that we've been talking about, but i think we should take it. %$* 13
i think so. %$* 18
that's exactly-- %$* 302
that's exactly what insurance is about. %$* 302
and so if you don't want to have a system where people contribute so that the entire population benefits, then you don't have a system like that. %$* 302
but as a youngish person, i can't quite see, yourself, you know, you may feel that this is a big problem. %$* 302
guess what? %$* 302
there's a future you, and the future you is going to be much older, and it's going to be-- %$* 302
if he walks carefully in traffic. %$* 13
megan mcardle, you want to respond? %$* 13
you know, i think that, that is a political issue. %$* 300
we already on net transfer a lot to older people and a lot of the set up here is transferring more and more to older people and to sicker people, which is a kind of a separate issue. %$* 300
it's actually kind of interesting how few people-- %$* 300
how little the transfers are until you get to be about 50. and i know we're all hoping to make it there, but is that politically sustainable when that's the minority of the voting base and when they're already getting most of the transfers and growing every day? %$* 300
and when the budget is under strain, when we have to find ways to cut, i do question that. %$* 300
i question whether in 20 years we're still going to be gung ho about giving money to people over the age of 50 instead of people over the age of 65. %$* 300
all right, a great question because it really wraps up what this whole debate has been about. %$* 13
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is "obamacare is now beyond rescue." so we're going to have you vote shortly. %$* 13
we're going to have closing statements in a moment, and we must remind you that you'll be voting again immediately afterwards for the second time. %$* 13
and it's the difference between those two votes that determines our winners. %$* 13
we do this section seated. %$* 13
so on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be three minutes each, and here to summarize his position against this motion that says, "obamacare is now beyond rescue," dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow, a family doctor and former assistant attorney general. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, douglas kamerow. %$* 13
brief correction, never been an attorney or an assistant attorney general. %$* 302
what'd i say? %$* 13
it's okay. %$* 302
do you want to be the-- %$* 13
you're a surgeon general. %$* 13
do you want me to say that you're an attorney general? %$* 13
you know the magic-- %$* 13
no offense to the attorneys out there. %$* 302
the magic of editing. %$* 13
i'm going to say it again so that the radio producer can make me seem a lot smarter than i am. %$* 13
here to summarize his position against the motion, douglas-- %$* 13
dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow, a family doctor and former assistant surgeon general. %$* 13
thank you very much, john, and thanks to you and the iq2 sponsors, and to megan and scott for a spirited debate. %$* 302
i want to thank the audience as well. %$* 302
the motion that we're talking about is, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." we've had a lot of fun throwing statistics back and forth and trying to make clever remarks, but it seems to me this really comes down to a very personal question. %$* 302
given where we are, what’s come before, and likely to happen in two scenarios. %$* 302
we keep obamacare or we dump it, what should we do? %$* 302
and like most of us, i could cite personal stories about health care coverage and access, recent ones about friends who had trouble getting coverage because of preexisting conditions, and now with the obamacare see their insurance and drug costs decrease markedly to 75 percent, or about young people like two of our kids who've already gotten affordable insurance coverage between college and their first jobs. %$* 302
but i think really the most telling story that i want to mention in conclusion is about medicaid, much maligned in this discussion today, but 35 years ago, my first job for the public health service was working as a gp in the national service board, the community health center in an urban underserved part of town, but because that city was in this state, that is, in new york state, the state that had and still has a generous medicaid program, most of our patients had insurance. %$* 302
most of our patients had access to care. %$* 302
they were poor. %$* 302
they were working or disabled. %$* 302
but they had health care, they had a medical home, and they had prescription drug benefits. %$* 302
and they benefitted from this, despite what you've heard here today. %$* 302
a lot of good care is delivered to medicaid patients. %$* 302
when i later moved to washington, d.c. and looked for a job in virginia, i asked about medicaid-- %$* 302
douglas you have 10 seconds left. %$* 13
i'll give you an extra five, so-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 302
cut to the chase. %$* 13
i want to say that because of obamacare, a lot of people are going to have medicaid, but also a lot of doctors are going to be paid more to take care of medicaid, and there's more money for the national service corps with doctors like me taking care of them. %$* 302
all right. %$* 13
thank you, doug kamerow. %$* 13
our motion is "obamacare is now beyond rescue." and here and to summarize his position in support of the motion, dr. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
he's a practicing physician and a former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
if i were to-- %$* 295
if i were asked to distill downobamacare's essential flaw, it would simply be this, the law tries to exert so much control over aspects of medicine and health care that it's subject to so much heterogeneity and individualism that nobody should ever have thought that they could be micromanaged from a remote bureaucracy in washington in a big piece of legislation. %$* 295
the result is what you're seeing, an over- engineering that may have started out elegant on someone's flowcharts but became undone when it was subjected to political realities and the marketplace. %$* 295
and it has-- %$* 295
and the marketplace had to conform to its rules. %$* 295
and the result is a massive exercise in unintended consequences and a health insurance product that clearly people don't want. %$* 295
people are saying this is just a rough start, but i will tell you this will get worse as this scheme unfolds. %$* 295
there’ already evidence plans aren’t entering the market in 2015, premiums certainly will rise next year, probably not as much as we thought because of the reinsurance pools, but those pools eventually go away. %$* 295
small businesses will dump people once their grandfathering is up at the end of this year, and you're going to see small businesses' cancellation notifications. %$* 295
networks and drug formulators will have to be narrowed further next year as this whole market gets repriced off the second cheapest plan in every state. %$* 295
and these structures in obamacare that are so unappealing will start to evolve into the commercial marketplace just like the part d structures involved in tier commercial drug plans. %$* 295
2014 was the high water mark for this scheme. %$* 295
the insurance part will only get worse from here. %$* 295
and this is hardly the ambition that is that its architects had in mind. %$* 295
obamacare surely will help some people. %$* 295
those below 200 percent of the federal poverty level will be helped by this i think, but a lot more will be hurt as they find themselves spending more money than they previously did to buy their way out of this scheme. %$* 295
we didn't have to hurt some people to help some people in this country, but that's precisely what we did. %$* 295
thank you, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
our motion is "obamacare is now beyond rescue," and here to speak against the motion in his summary statement, jonathan chait. %$* 13
he's a daily columnist for the new yorker magazine. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan chait. %$* 13
let me let you in on a secret. %$* 301
when we set up this debate back in the fall, it was a while ago, it looked like obamacare might really collapse. %$* 301
the website was broken. %$* 301
we didn't know when it would be fixed. %$* 301
we didn't know if it would be fixed. %$* 301
some people thought it would never be fixed. %$* 301
it looks like it's possible the law would actually not come into effect. %$* 301
but now it has come into effect. %$* 301
now we're actually living the experience of this law. %$* 301
so the position that was an outlandish and somewhat exaggerated fear three months ago, is now kind of silly. %$* 301
and i think if you look back into the history of libertarian anti-statism in america, there's a long tradition of these kinds of fear mongering predictions, senators who were opposed to child labor laws a few years ago saying that children would refuse to do chores in their household, ronald reagan saying, "if we pass medicare the government will tell doctors they can't live here, they can't live there, and one day we'll look back at a day when we had freedom in america and wonder what happened to it." so this is a constant recurring pattern, social security, all kinds of civil rights laws, labor laws. %$* 301
the american far right lives in terror of government, and it's ideologically understandable that they would oppose these laws, but they translate this ideological terror into a series of verifiable predictions about what will happen if these laws come into effect. %$* 301
and one day we're going to look back at the kinds of predictions they've been making about obamacare, and those will go in the time capsule, and they'll look just as silly as the predictions that were made by all these other reforms, which is not to say that it works perfectly. %$* 301
it's not to say those other things that work perfectly. %$* 301
believe me, child labor was a big part of the economy a hundred years ago and when we banned it it actually imposed a lot of disruption and pain on people. %$* 301
right now it seems obvious and back then it was really hard. %$* 301
families lost an income. %$* 301
but these changes did fundamentally work. %$* 301
the market responded. %$* 301
people responded and i think when we look back time we'll see that the people who were saying the law must fail were really just people who didn't agree with its goals in the first place. %$* 301
thank you, jonathan chait. %$* 13
our motion is: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position in support of this motion, megan mcardle. %$* 13
she's a blogger and columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, megan mcardle. %$* 13
so, i don't want to go into an anecdote; we can talk about people who just got coverage and there are people who have and couldn’t get it before and i’m happy for them, or i could talk about the people who have written me and said now i can't afford coverage and i had it before what do i do, and i don't have anything to tell them. %$* 300
that's not really the assessment of the law. %$* 300
they're just individual stories. %$* 300
it doesn’t tell us how it’s going. %$* 300
and the question isn't whether the status quo was bad, or anyone on this stage is a bad person. %$* 300
i think we all didn’t want the status quo. %$* 300
we're all good people. %$* 300
we all want to help the other americans to be as healthy as possible. %$* 300
the question is whether the law is undermining its own goals. %$* 300
and to think about going forward, we, you know, mr. %$* 300
chait says it’s now here. %$* 300
in fact, we still have a long way to go with a bunch of unpopular stuff that is going to happen. %$* 300
small businesses are starting to get a wave of cancellations that are going to come through the year, and they're being asked for a lot more money. %$* 300
a lot of that is due to obamacare. %$* 300
the cadillac tax, 40 percent surcharge on generous health insurance is especially hard on companies with old sick people, but a lot of benefits managers are saying basically everyone is going to have to go to light plans and scale down rather than get hit by that tax. %$* 300
we’ve got comparative effectiveness research which is going to start determining what sorts of things medicare will reimburse at what rates. %$* 300
we've got the individual mandate. %$* 300
people aren't going to pay it this year. %$* 300
they pay it in 2015.as each of those things comes due, there will be an outcry from people who are affected. %$* 300
and the administration has so far shown no willingness to stand up. %$* 300
yes, you may have to break an omelet to make eggs, but the administration is not going to tell the eggs that, and the republicans certainly aren't going to make the eggs crack itself. %$* 300
so, if we are not willing to impose the pain, and so far we haven't, this law cannot survive. %$* 300
it is set up as a giant piece of interlocking machinery. %$* 300
you can't just rip the carburetor out and hope that it’s still working. %$* 300
that is why obamacare is beyond rescue, because we are not willing to face the hard choices the law made necessary. %$* 300
thank you, megan mcardle. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued best. %$* 13
we want you to go again to the keypads at your seat and vote now a second time after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
the motion is: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and remember it's the difference between the opening vote and this vote that determines our winners in percentage point terms. %$* 13
we’ll the results locked out in just a couple of minutes. %$* 13
give me a few more seconds before we lock it out. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
we have locked out the votes and i just want to say a couple of things. %$* 13
if i could have your attention, please. %$* 13
this is something that really is important for us to say, because the whole purpose, goal, and culture of intelligence squared is to raise the level of public discourse to get people on the stage to argue about the ideas and not about each other’s characters and personalities, just as megan mcardle said, everyone up here is good, they all basically in the long run want the same thing. %$* 13
i just want to congratulate these debaters for bringing that spirit to this conversation-- %$* 13
and i don't think this has ever happened before, but all of the questions were good tonight. %$* 13
they were all really, really well phrased and i want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
i just wanted to ask scott gottlieb, i thought during the middle of the debate i saw your smartphone open on the desk and you were watching a twitter feed. %$* 13
is that your lifeline coming in there? %$* 13
i just wanted to see how i was doing. %$* 295
yeah, well, watching a live tweet about myself sounds like something i would do. %$* 13
we’d like you all to tweet about this debate. %$* 13
use the twitter handle @iq2us, the hashtag is obamacare. %$* 13
we want to also talk about our upcoming debates. %$* 13
we've made a change to our lineup. %$* 13
our debate next month-- %$* 13
it's on february 12th. %$* 13
the topic was going to be on labor unions. %$* 13
that has been moved to our fall 2014 debates. %$* 13
taking its place-- %$* 13
we're going to do it here at the kaufman-- %$* 13
the motion will be grant snowden clemency. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, we'll have ben wizner. %$* 13
he is snowden's legal adviser and director of the aclu's speech privacy and technology project. %$* 13
he'll be for the motion. %$* 13
against the motion, ambassador james woolsey. %$* 13
he's chairman of the foundation for defense of democracies and former director of central intelligence. %$* 13
his partner, also against this motion, andrew mccarthy, the former top federal prosecutor and contributing editor at national review. %$* 13
the remaining seat on that panel arguing for the motion has not been filled yet. %$* 13
we will announce it on our website shortly. %$* 13
it's not who you think it is-- %$* 13
you know-- %$* 13
the rest of our spring topics are these: putin's russia. %$* 13
we'll be doing universities and online education. %$* 13
we'll be doing millenials in the workplace. %$* 13
and we'll be doing death. %$* 13
going to be traveling up to harvard shortly to debate affirmative action on campus, and to the national constitution center in philadelphia, where we will be debating the targeted killing of u.s.citizens abroad and its constitutionality. %$* 13
tickets for all of our spring debates are on sale through our website www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and for those of you who can't be in our live audiences and those of you who are watching now on our website or on for a.tv-- %$* 13
we can be seen that way. %$* 13
and as i've said, all of these debates will be available on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we have the final results in. %$* 13
our motion is this: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
we've had you vote before the debate and had you vote a second time after hearing the arguments on this very motion. %$* 13
and remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in your judgment-- %$* 13
in percentage point terms-- %$* 13
will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, the initial vote on the motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue-- %$* 13
before the debate, 16 percent agreed with the motion. %$* 13
53 percent were against. %$* 13
31 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you voted a second time. %$* 13
the winner is the one that has changed the numbers the most in percentage point terms. %$* 13
so, here are the results of the second vote. %$* 13
obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their vote went to 32 percent. %$* 13
that's an increase of 16 percentage points-- %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, they went from 53 percent. %$* 13
second vote, 59 percent. %$* 13
that's only six percent. %$* 13
it is not enough. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue has triumphed in this debated. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

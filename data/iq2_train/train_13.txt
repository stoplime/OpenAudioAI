uh-- %$* 9
art dealer. %$* 170
art dealers. %$* 9
art dealers, i thought, were all missing the same chromosome. %$* 170
okay, now, i don’t know. %$* 9
is that the same chromosome that is missing in the stock market, of people involved in the stock- %$* 9
no. %$* 13
can i take that as your question? %$* 13
it’s a good one. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 9
well, we see your point. %$* 13
so do you want to take that, jerry? %$* 13
very quickly. %$* 170
that’s jason kaufman, a very good writer. %$* 170
i’m going to say that i don’t. %$* 170
look, of course, there’s unethical behavior in the art market. %$* 170
i want to go back to this question. %$* 170
i would never say there isn’t. %$* 170
i mean, i’m sure people want to make money. %$* 170
but if, just because there is unethical behavior, i ask you, is it behavior less ethical than the stock market? %$* 170
i’m, again, asking for your better angels, to understand that of course this exists. %$* 170
so the second you feel like, oh god, yeah, there’re people manipulating the prices-- %$* 170
well, that’s true. %$* 170
i don’t think our side is arguing against that idea. %$* 170
but we’re saying that’s not what it is. %$* 170
that does not become the definition of it and make it worse than the worst thing that’s happened in the united states in forty-five years, for god’s sake. %$* 170
if you really want to make that comparison, whoa, you really hate the art world. %$* 170
right. %$* 168
you think, we are really khomeini or something. %$* 170
which is fine— %$* 170
question from the rear. %$* 13
he’s sadistic to be here. %$* 168
does the panel feel that, in fact it’s debating a issue that’s not a debate? %$* 9
that basically, are you voicing that we’re really talking about people, and whether the people are in the stock market, whether in the art market, whether in the garbage market, it really doesn’t matter. %$* 9
the question of what is ethical behavior, as an individual, in whatever market you’re in, would seem to be the, can i say the basic premise that, going here is all manufacturing. %$* 9
and i just, i don’t hear enough people talking about the fact that they’re really on one side or the other. %$* 9
and that you’re really struggling with the same issue, of, it’s a personal matter. %$* 9
and you can have good ethics, bad ethics, anyplace, it’s really a personal question, it’s not a question of regulation—i’m sorry, i’m going on. %$* 9
it’s not a question— %$* 9
no, actually i think that’s a really excellent question— %$* 13
—i’ll cut you off ‘cause we get your point but %$* 13
adam, that sounds like it’s meant for you— %$* 13
we don’t agree with you, we are for this proposition. %$* 169
we wanna win the debate. %$* 169
they are against. %$* 169
so, we’re not all together here, we’re for the proposition, they’re against. %$* 169
so if you agree with us, you wanna vote over here. %$* 169
that being said, it was very interesting that, richard was saying something against the auctions %$* 169
but chuck was chiming in, and so i feel obliged to say something for the auction houses, just to balance it out here. %$* 169
remember, if something sells at auction, somebody bought it. %$* 169
that is a fact. %$* 169
doesn’t matter if they chandeliered it, doesn’t matter if they advertised it, i don’t care if they shined it with shoe polish. %$* 169
somebody bought it, and we can actually see that. %$* 169
that is not possible in the private market, so %$* 169
for better or for worse, this market wouldn’t exist without the auction houses, and we need them as collectors, i think as dealers, and i think, artists often don’t understand that, the auction market, the auction house actually makes this a market and is ultimately to everyone’s benefit. %$* 169
question from the far back. %$* 13
as a lawyer who defends other lawyers who get into ethical trouble, and actually, yes, but it’s not an oxymoron, i—attorney ethics. %$* 9
the question is we have rules, you can’t lie, you can’t steal. %$* 9
there are actually defined rules. %$* 9
why can’t everybody on this panel just agree, that in fact you do need a set of rules, that define what you can and can’t do within your own industry? %$* 9
can i ask you then, i will answer your question in the form of a question. %$* 170
i don’t know if that’s bad. %$* 170
i have a painting here i say is worth a thousand dollars. %$* 170
what’s—how are we gonna put a rule on that. %$* 170
professor charles wolfram said it’s puffery. %$* 9
there is a subjective view, however— %$* 9
yes— %$* 170
—the moment i ask you the question, do you have a valuation in your bag for less than that amount, if you do and you say you don’t, that is a false statement and therefore it is sanctionable. %$* 9
i could never go to trial. %$* 170
‘cause i kinda lost you, all i know %$* 170
all i know, is that, i just sold one of these for a thousand dollars this morning, and this is by the same woman, and it’s a thousand dollars. %$* 170
and there’s no rule on that. %$* 170
there is no rule, you could sell it for 1200, which is fine with me, or you could sell it for 800, if you decided to discount it now that the economy’s a little, ehh-ehh-ehh. %$* 170
it’s fine, there should not be rules in this. %$* 170
not the rules you’re looking for. %$* 170
but shouldn’t there be black-and-white rules regarding what you can and can’t do— %$* 9
this is not an age of certainty, my friends— %$* 169
yeah, the black-and-white rules are take care of the art— %$* 168
we’re in— %$* 170
—be a good custodian— %$* 168
—an age of uncertainty— %$* 170
that’s all— %$* 168
—again. %$* 170
like the renaissance. %$* 170
amy cappellazzo— %$* 13
we do have rules, we have— %$* 165
no, i’m just say— %$* 168
—we have very strict rules. %$* 165
richard feigen— %$* 13
on authenticity, when i make an invoice out and it says this is by pablo picasso, it is and if it’s proven otherwise— %$* 165
yes. %$* 170
—then i am subject to penalties. %$* 165
of course. %$* 170
if i say this is oil on canvas and it’s something else, if i say it’s this size and it’s that size, we have rules. %$* 165
yes— %$* 170
has to be— %$* 168
and if anybody has a problem they go to the art dealers association of america and complain, and feigen gets blasted, i mean i, i have very strict rules and we have very strict codes of ethics. %$* 165
what i’m saying is, that— %$* 165
so you’re ethical. %$* 170
well, yes. %$* 165
okay— %$* 170
we’re ethical. %$* 165
that’s what— %$* 170
but i don’t believe in lying %$* 165
me neither. %$* 170
and so i don’t believe in saying— %$* 165
uh, me neither— %$* 168
—that this guy over here bid when he didn’t, or it was the chandelier bidding against some poor innocent guy that comes along and thinks he has a competitor. %$* 165
a man who pays a million dollars for a painting because the under-bidder said 950 and he figures his exposure is $50,000, that’s his risk. %$* 165
he thinks there’s a willing and able buyer at 950. what happens if the willing and able buyer was the chandelier? %$* 165
that would be unethical. %$* 170
well, it— %$* 165
ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the head-to-head section of our debate. %$* 13
we only have a few minutes left, i wanna remind you where we are, we are going to hear closing statements shortly, from each of the panelists. %$* 13
you were polled when you came in this evening %$* 13
with the motion, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market,” 32 percent of you were for this motion, 30 percent were against, and 38 percent were undecided. %$* 13
we will poll you again shortly, but we now want to have closing statements of two minutes each from each of our panelists beginning with artist chuck close arguing against the motion. %$* 13
it was not me but dave hickey who said works of art have no intrinsic value. %$* 166
all their value is extrinsic, it is invested from without and over a period of time. %$* 166
and that is truth. %$* 166
it’s not what any—the reason it can’t be regulated is it’s a kind of consensus. %$* 166
a consensus that’s formed, between art critics and art dealers, and art historians, and artists themselves. %$* 166
you can hype something for a while, you can spin it, you can try and produce, you can try and put it up for auction and manipulate it that way. %$* 166
but finally, it is—the art world is not hog futures. %$* 166
when you lose money in the stock market as i just did, i’m not gonna hang my stock certificates on the wall. %$* 166
if i bought something i like, and no one else in the world thinks it’s worth anything anymore, i at least having something i like. %$* 166
and that is what makes it different from other kinds of investments. %$* 166
you can’t just look at it as hog futures or pork bellies or anything else. %$* 166
it is ruled by passion, and it is a consensus that’s formed amongst art-world professionals of all kinds, and most important by artists themselves. %$* 166
and you can manipulate it up to a point, what good is trying to regulate it when it is a self-correcting process. %$* 166
when the hype and everything else falls away, you’ll be looking at the work, and if there is not support for that work, if the professionals in the field, those people who know it and care about it whether in the auction houses, whether they’re dealers, whether they’re critics, or collectors or artists, that consensus is what forms value and nothing else matters. %$* 166
thank you, chuck close. %$* 13
making his summary statement for the motion, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market,” richard feigen, an art dealer and collector, founder of richard l. feigen and company. %$* 13
i don’t quarrel with anything that chuck says except, i do not believe that it addresses the point of this debate. %$* 165
i believe that nothing else has much val— intrinsic value than art. %$* 165
i don’t believe in anything else, i don’t believe in green pieces of paper that they print in washington, ad infinitum to the trillions of dollars. %$* 165
i believe in art. %$* 165
however %$* 165
there is an art market. %$* 165
this was created by the press, publicizing these huge prices, and by the financial institutions, who are lending money on it, who have set up departments to advise their clients on buying art. %$* 165
it has become, it has been transformed, metastasized, into a financial market. %$* 165
and because it is a financial market, for better or for worse, although i would prefer that it were not, because i am passionate about buying art, i’d rather buy it and this makes it more difficult for me, and more expensive for me, the fact is, that it is a financial market. %$* 165
and as such, it is totally unregulated. %$* 165
and in my view things go on in this market that could not happen in the securities markets. %$* 165
people would go to jail. %$* 165
okay, you can’t pretend that there’s a buyer when there isn’t, there’s no transparency at all. %$* 165
and what i’m saying is, i’m not saying to regulate the prices of art because, that is between the artist and his dealer as chuck says. %$* 165
but the fact is nobody is saying—nobody is saying, something that’s not true. %$* 165
i’m saying that, in the auction market, and i agree that auctions are indispensable to establish values and for people that wanna go in and acquire art— in that market, there is no transparency, and there is deception, deliberate deception. %$* 165
and i do believe, that it ought to be regulated. %$* 165
that this kind of activity %$* 165
now, i wish all of you to vote for our position here. %$* 165
thank you, richard feigen. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, amy cappellazzo, deputy chairman and international co-head of post-war and contemporary art at christie’s. %$* 13
feel it’s very important to address richard directly here in his, clear dislike of the auction houses. %$* 168
richard, if it weren’t for the auction houses bringing liquidity and transparency, what you would do all day would be a mere curiosity. %$* 168
so, the market depends on the liquidity and transparency that the auction houses bring, and remember that the area of the market you’re calling the most unethical or potentially corrupt is the only area that’s regulated, in fact. %$* 168
positively, i make the proposition, that this is way too specific an argument, that auction is an ancient art form and a completely legitimate way to sell something in the world and there’s a sort of ancient rhythm and dance to auction that, people seem to accept and understand. %$* 168
and there’s many ways for consumers to become informed. %$* 168
to go back to the proposition, i think my hypothesis is anybody who signs up for the art world, signs up to participate by a certain set of values and ideas about how we look after and take care of the art, i mean %$* 168
some of us are compensated well but no one’s in it for the dough. %$* 168
there is definitely another motive to be involved. %$* 168
and art exists with this larger art world that is the kind of moral and ethical conscience of what the market does. %$* 168
if you don’t have street cred, and soul, you ain’t gonna go very far in the art market. %$* 168
so i argue the proposition that, in fact the art world is at least as ethical as the stock market if not vastly more so, that individual people are unethical in their behavior and we all know them in every single industry, and the system of the art world, in fact, stands to be potentially more ethical because, there are all sorts of various motives to be involved but primarily it’s for the—for the love of the art itself. %$* 168
thank you, amy cappellazzo. %$* 13
summarizing for the motion, michael hue-williams, founder of the albion gallery. %$* 13
i wanted to remind you, the idea that regulations are what force ethics, and in an unregulated market like the art market, it is hard to force people to adhere to ethical principles. %$* 167
without ethical principles however, and with the manipulations of market, we can look, for instance, to the tulip market in 1636.we create bubbles, and these bubbles are intrinsically unhealthy. %$* 167
you may all know charles mackay’s extraordinary book, extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds. %$* 167
people follow each other, because they feel that there are financial opportunities. %$* 167
especially when these markets are unregulated. %$* 167
the tulip market crashed, but it was regulated by the dutch government, rather too late. %$* 167
but, the point here is, that the art market is unregulated, it is open to unethical behavior because it’s unregulated. %$* 167
not how often is it unregulated, but the fact that it, it is intrinsically unethical because it is, as i said before, it is not regulated, it is not transparent, and there are, most importantly, absolutely no barriers to entry. %$* 167
so that anybody may come in and manipulate the market. %$* 167
whether we like them or dislike them, whether we admire them or not, is absolutely irrelevant. %$* 167
the important point here, is to remember that, the market is intrinsically open to manipulation, and intrinsically unethical. %$* 167
whether it’s actually happening or not, is not important to the debate tonight. %$* 167
what is important is to understand, that the market is intrinsically unethical. %$* 167
thank you, michael hue-williams. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, jerry saltz, columnist and art critic for new york magazine. %$* 13
art first, everything else follows. %$* 170
there has been an art market since the renaissance. %$* 170
right now, we’ve just finished a time of the biggest art market on the face of the earth. %$* 170
and now that art market is contracting. %$* 170
and in the coming years, a lot is going to change. %$* 170
things will herniate out, other dealers, critics, collectors %$* 170
et cetera, that we can’t yet see. %$* 170
i would say that, art is a way of knowing the world, and a way of knowing yourself. %$* 170
art will have— the art market, became content for the art world. %$* 170
it’s content for a lot of you right now—i want you to vote for our side, for us %$* 170
but also for you, if i can say something that’s egotistical, because %$* 170
if you’re only seeing art for its value, and saying that it’s %$* 170
of course it’s going to be unethical. %$* 170
the people that buy and sell it. %$* 170
that almost goes without saying. %$* 170
but is it really more unethical, than what’s going on out there? %$* 170
real pain? %$* 170
real serious stuff, world-changing economic stuff? %$* 170
if you think that, then you really—i just wanna say when you go to an art gallery or museum %$* 170
that could be in your way. %$* 170
that you think that all of this is unethical. %$* 170
that unethical. %$* 170
yeah, it’s unethical, but %$* 170
no more than you are. %$* 170
thank you, jerry saltz. %$* 13
finally summarizing for the motion that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, adam lindemann, an entrepreneur and a major collector of contemporary art. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 169
the, jerry, i just wanna say— to all of you over there, i do feel for you, and i’m with you %$* 169
but, of course, i’m with my teammates here and— i appreciate the difficult time you’ve had tonight %$* 169
and i love— %$* 169
the feeling is mutual— %$* 170
—everything that you said, you know, but the real—a minute 30, okay. %$* 169
art is based on two things as far as i can tell, and, jerry said we’re all learning on the job, and i—you know what, i couldn’t agree more. %$* 169
i’m learning right now. %$* 169
but the two c’s are consensus and confidence, and these are there, things that the art market is built on, so what makes a great artist. %$* 169
it’s sort of this platonic concept, is there such a thing as great art? %$* 169
perhaps, but, in whose mind, the thing that makes art valuable is consensus, what makes picasso picasso, because everyone thinks he’s great. %$* 169
someone thinks he’s crap and that doesn’t really matter because people are still paying a lotta money for it. %$* 169
so, consensus is what makes the art market, and then we need that extra thing that often the auction house brings, a dealer can bring, which is confidence, and, those are the two things that, that make us feel comfortable with art being valuable. %$* 169
the reality is though that the ethical side is up to the individual that you’re dealing with. %$* 169
there is no way to guarantee that anything is worth anything. %$* 169
and so, when we’re speaking in terms of dave hickey’s intrinsic and extrinsic value, the intrinsic value of art, is perhaps infinite. %$* 169
but the extrinsic value is really something that is almost impossible to measure on any given day. %$* 169
thank you, john. %$* 169
the, jerry, i just wanna say— to all of you over there, i do feel for you, and i’m with you %$* 169
but, of course, i’m with my teammates here and— i appreciate the difficult time you’ve had tonight %$* 169
and i love— %$* 169
thank you, adam lindemann. %$* 13
and thank you to our panelists who have now concluded their portion of the evening. %$* 13

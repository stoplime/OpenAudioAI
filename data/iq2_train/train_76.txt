it started with founder and chairman robert rosenkranz-- %$* 13
normally, before our debates in new york, bob and i chat for just a couple of minutes about a sort of framing of the evening that's ahead for us. %$* 13
and in this case, the basic question i wanted to ask you is-- %$* 13
you know, the language-- %$* 13
“the u.s. has no dog in the fight”-- %$* 13
could be interpreted a lot of different ways. %$* 13
what is-- %$* 13
what do we intend by that language, this debate to be about? %$* 13
well, let me start off by saying what we don't intend. %$* 1
this is not a debate about whether syria is consequential. %$* 1
it's clearly iran's sole ally. %$* 1
it's a site of a humanitarian disaster of huge proportions. %$* 1
there will be no debate about that. %$* 1
so, what-- %$* 1
put me in mind of this language-- %$* 1
“the u.s. has no dog in the fight with syria”-- %$* 1
was a dinner i attended in singapore. %$* 1
and my dinner partner was the former head of the kgb, ambassador chebrikov. %$* 1
and i was-- %$* 1
charming. %$* 13
a charming guy. %$* 1
very well-informed. %$* 1
so, i said, “what are you guys doing in syria? %$* 1
you can't like the idea of an islamist regime like the iranians getting stronger. %$* 1
what are you doing there? %$* 1
” and he said, “look, we don't like assad any better than you do. %$* 1
but we think that the alternative to assad is, at best, an islamist state. %$* 1
and at worse, a new al-qaeda stronghold. %$* 1
so, we think assad is the best of the bad lot of choices.” %$* 1
so, the russians have picked their side. %$* 13
they picked their guy. %$* 13
yes. %$* 1
they picked their guy and he seems to be doing better, with their support. %$* 1
a few days later, i happened to have dinner with henry kissinger. %$* 1
and i essentially posed the same question to him. %$* 1
and his view was unless the united states sees a clear way to influence an outcome and a clear way to make that outcome better suited to our national security interests, we should stay out. %$* 1
and in a sense, this language-- %$* 1
the u.s. has no dog in the fight with syria-- %$* 1
is asking whether those two opinions are correct or whether there is an identifiable income that we can get behind, that serves our interests at least reasonably well, and is worth a commitment of u.s. military involvement or other kinds of involvement to try to bring it about. %$* 1
yeah. %$* 13
but we do a lot of debates where it-- %$* 13
there's a clear dividing line between the two sides. %$* 13
you know, one that comes to mind is “ban college football.” that was easy. %$* 13
yes or no. %$* 13
this one is one of those debates that's full of nuance and gradation. %$* 13
well, that's absolutely right, john. %$* 1
i mean, in a debate like this, nobody's going to say, “we should be all in with all the military resources, full-on involved, boots on the ground to try to create an outcome.”and nobody's going to say, “this is a matter of no real consequence to the united states. %$* 1
we can kind of ignore it.” so, it's all going to be matters of degree. %$* 1
but i think, ultimately, there are going to be real differences between these sides and their discussion is going to be very illuminating. %$* 1
and robust. %$* 13
and let's bring on our robust debaters. %$* 13
now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
and this is one of those times. %$* 13
may i invite one more round of applause, please? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
are times when, for a president, there is nothing to debate. %$* 13
we are attacked. %$* 13
you go to war. %$* 13
pearl harbor. %$* 13
september 2001.other people's wars, those are trickier. %$* 13
the u.s.intervenes to put an end to the killing in bosnia and was glad that it did. %$* 13
the u.s.was passive about mass killing in rwanda and ended up regretting that. %$* 13
so now, there is syria. %$* 13
and it is a mess. %$* 13
a death toll that is crossing into six figures. %$* 13
millions of people homeless. %$* 13
a dictator who is suspected of using chemical weapons against his own people. %$* 13
and fighters-- %$* 13
thousands of them, from all over the world, descending on the chaos with a vision of creating an islamist state. %$* 13
so, does it behoove the u.s., urgently and immediately, to get more involved in syria? %$* 13
up to and possibly including military action. %$* 13
or is the wiser thing for the u.s., when it appears there are no good options, to stay back and maybe this time, let somebody else mostly sort out the problem? %$* 13
now, that sounds like a debate. %$* 13
so, let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are in aspen and on the stage of the paepcke auditorium at the aspen institute. %$* 13
and in partnership with the aspen strategy group. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters-- %$* 13
two against two-- %$* 13
who will be arguing out this motion-- %$* 13
for and against-- %$* 13
the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
as always, our debates go in three rounds. %$* 13
and then the audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side can win. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and first, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome graham allison. %$* 13
graham, you are the director of harvard's belfer center for science and international affairs. %$* 13
you served in the reagan and the clinton administrations. %$* 13
you were assistant secretary of defense under clinton. %$* 13
as a youth, before all of that, you wrote a book called “essence of decision” on the cuban missile crisis that forever afterwards changed the way the people understand decision-making. %$* 13
you also, as a youth, at age 31, made it to full professor at harvard. %$* 13
so, graham allison. %$* 13
what took you so long? %$* 13
well, i was young and even more foolish. %$* 283
ladies and gentlemen, graham allison. %$* 13
and graham, your partner tonight in this debate is? %$* 13
is the handsome richard falkenrath. %$* 283
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
richard, you're also taking the position that the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
you are a principal of the chertoff group. %$* 13
you're an adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations. %$* 13
you served in several capacities during the george w.bush administration, including deputy homeland security adviser, deputy assistant to the president. %$* 13
but you recently told bloomberg-- %$* 13
and i quote-- %$* 13
“the cold hard facts are that as a global economic matter, syria just doesn't matter that much.” that is about as blunt as it gets. %$* 13
is blunt your style? %$* 13
yes. %$* 119
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and here to argue against the motion-- %$* 13
it means that they do believe that the u.s. has a dog in the fight in syria-- %$* 13
i'd like to introduce and welcome nicholas burns. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nicholas burns. %$* 13
nick, you're a professor at the harvard kennedy school and director of the aspen strategy group. %$* 13
your career as a foreign service officer-- %$* 13
done a lot of stuff, undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005 to 2006, lead u.s. negotiator on iran's nuclear program, ambassador to nato, ambassador to greece, special assistant to president clinton, director of soviet affairs under president h.w. bush. %$* 13
back in 1980, you were stationed in mauritania as an intern. %$* 13
so, you are here to tell the young people of america that a good internship can get you someplace. %$* 13
in 1980 i was the lowest ranking person in the history of the united states government in mauritania, but it was a great experience. %$* 284
thank you. %$* 284
nick burns, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and nick, your partner is? %$* 13
ambassador nigel sheinwald. %$* 284
ladies and gentlemen, sir nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
sir nigel, you have agreed that while you're here in the colonies, and for the purposes of this debate, you will be nigel? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
you are also arguing against the motion, that the u.s. has no dog in the fight-- %$* 13
it means you think the u.s.does have a dog in this fight. %$* 13
you were british ambassador to the united states. %$* 13
you were foreign policy and defense adviser to prime minister tony blair. %$* 13
and also, as u.k.ambassador and permanent rep to the european union, in 2006, you went to syria. %$* 13
you held secret talks with president bashar al-assad. %$* 13
the guardian said you offered assad a choice: continue an alliance with iran or enjoy a normalization of relations with the west. %$* 13
he made his choice. %$* 13
we know that. %$* 13
what we want to know from you-- %$* 13
what's the guy like? %$* 13
not something i'd want to do every week, i think. %$* 285
but it was a very tough conversation. %$* 285
and i'll talk a bit more about it later. %$* 285
all right. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
at this intelligence squared u.s.debate, you, our live audience here in aspen, act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again at its conclusion. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have changed the most-- %$* 13
in terms of your vote, in terms of percentage points-- %$* 13
will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
there's a keypad at your seat. %$* 13
and you want to pay attention to numbers one, two, and three. %$* 13
i'm going to give a visual on this because this is a tricky motion because of the negative in it. %$* 13
if you feel that the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria, if you're with these guys right now, that means you push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion that the u.s. has no dog in the fight in syria, in other words, you think it does have a fight in the-- %$* 13
with syria, you're voting with these guys, that's pushing number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, which is a perfectly honorable position in this one, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys, and you can also-- %$* 13
if you push the wrong one, just correct yourself and the system will lock in the last vote. %$* 13
once we lock out the vote, we have instantaneous results, means at the end of the debate, second vote, within a minute or two we'll be able to tell you who's won the debate according to our rules, which, once again, is the team that has picked up the most percentage points from its starting position. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
on to round one. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and here to speak first for the motion from the lectern, graham allison. %$* 13
he is director of the belfer center for science and international affairs, professor of government at the harvard kennedy school, and former assistant secretary of defense. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, graham allison. %$* 13
so thank you very much, john. %$* 283
and it's an honor for rich and i to appear even in a debate with two such distinguished colleagues. %$* 283
but i want to warn you at the outset that this is a bit of a mismatch. %$* 283
rich and i are academics and think tank types. %$* 283
nick and nigel are two of the most effective public advocates we've seen in recent times. %$* 283
nick is one of my colleagues and friends at harvard, our offices are about 20 feet apart. %$* 283
i introduce him as often as i can to harvard audiences because i would prefer him to speak than me. %$* 283
and always i say, which is what i truly believe, that the u.s.has had no more effective public spokesman in modern times than nick burns when he was assistant secretary for public affairs. %$* 283
nigel is a legend-- %$* 283
nigel is a legend in washington as the british ambassador to the u.s., who is an extremely, again, effective public spokesman. %$* 283
so as you listen to the discussion tonight, i hope you'll think about the evidence and the analysis presented and not the eloquence because if-- %$* 283
if that was the case, you can vote now and be done. %$* 283
so the motion is about a dog in the fight. %$* 283
let me just ask, how many people here have a dog? %$* 283
okay. %$* 283
so i just want to see if it's a dog friendly audience. %$* 283
i think aspen is usually fairly dog friendly. %$* 283
so as you think about the argument tonight, consider this, you go around a corner, you confront dogs in a fight, and you think what to do. %$* 283
and compare that with a second case in which you're confronting a dog fight in which one dog has its mouth around the other's throat and you discover that it's your dog. %$* 283
now, the question is, "is this america's dog in this fight? %$* 283
" so as the moderator reminded us, this assignment tonight is not whether the u.s. should care about the dogs that are tearing each other apart in syria tonight. %$* 283
it's tragic and anybody who looks at it without having their heart torn ought to have a-- %$* 283
you know, an mri to see if their heart's turned to stone. %$* 283
the question is, "how much should we care and what should we do about it? %$* 283
" so in the language of national security, the question is, "does what's happening in syria so impact american vital national interests that we're compelled to do everything we can including military actions to secure our interests? %$* 283
" that's what it is to have a vital national interest. %$* 283
and, secondly, if the answer to that is, "yes," or even if you're a little shaky on that one, "has anybody been able to identify a feasible american military intervention that would likely make the situation better over the long run than-- %$* 283
after we had acted than in the case we did not act? %$* 283
"so if you think about this be clear and let me be as unambiguous as we can. %$* 283
our answer to these questions-- %$* 283
these two questions are no and no. %$* 283
no, the u.s.does not have a vital national interest in what's happening in syria, and two, no. %$* 283
no one, is at least to my satisfaction, or rich's or indeed to chairman dempsey, chairman of the jcs, identified a feasible american military intervention, which after the fact would likely make the situation over time better than the alternative. %$* 283
so, it's to our opponents, i think, to explain how and why they disagree with these judgments, and suggest to us what evidence leads them to that conclusion. %$* 283
in these opening comments, i'm going to just make some general comments-- %$* 283
general big points, big picture, that bear on the question you have in front of you, and then my colleague, rich, is going to drill down in more detail. %$* 283
four quick points. %$* 283
first, sam nunn who is a member of the aspen strategy group, which we're all here as part of, insists that we draw the distinction between vivid and vital. %$* 283
because he says whenever something is vivid, especially if it appears on tv over and over and people are being killed, americans, or many americans, imagine well, we must have a vital interest there because it's impacting our interests and since we're the world's greatest military super power, maybe there's a military intervention we could undertake to make things better. %$* 283
in our view, that's not the case here. %$* 283
this is a vivid, painful, but not vital. %$* 283
vital in the dictionary, read it, says essential for survival and well-being. %$* 283
in the mantra of national security it says essential for the preservation of the u.s.as a free society with our fundamental institutions and values intact. %$* 283
syria does not meet that test. %$* 283
now some of you are saying well, maybe that's too high a test. %$* 283
i mean, could anything threaten our vital interest? %$* 283
and i would say in 1990, when saddam tried to annex kuwait and threatened the whole possibility of the flow of oil from the persian gulf, president bush, the father, chose military action and that was the right choice. %$* 283
graham allison, i'm sorry, your introductory remark time is up and concluded. %$* 13
thank you very much, graham allison. %$* 13
i want to point out our introductory remarks last six minutes each. %$* 13
i gave graham seven because he spent the first time saying such nice things about the other side, and-- %$* 13
although it might have been a sneak attack. %$* 13
i'm not sure. %$* 13
also, your timers will say six minutes from this point forward. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria, and here to speak against the motion is our next debater, nick burns. %$* 13
he's professor at the harvard kennedy school, director of the aspen strategy group, and former undersecretary of state for political affairs. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, nicholas burns. %$* 13
john, thank you very much. %$* 284
good afternoon everyone. %$* 284
it's a pleasure to be here. %$* 284
pleasure for nigel and i to be with richard and graham. %$* 284
they're both good friends. %$* 284
i won't try to butter them up anymore. %$* 284
i need my time, but i will say this. %$* 284
we've been asked to address one question. %$* 284
does the united states of america have a dog in the fight in syria? %$* 284
the question wasn't whether it's vital. %$* 284
the question wasn't whether it's feasible. %$* 284
do we have an interest in who wins in this fight in syria? %$* 284
and the answer is unequivocally of course, yes, without any question. %$* 284
because americans should be supporting the syrian people who have been brutalized by the syrian dictatorship of bashar al-assad. %$* 284
and we should oppose the assad regime because it's being supported by iran and hezbollah and russia. %$* 284
so that's the dog in the fight for the united states. %$* 284
and what happens in syria really matters to our country for our national security. %$* 284
i would say it matters to every american. %$* 284
let me give you three reasons why. %$* 284
first, there's a humanitarian imperative. %$* 284
i think everybody knows what's been happening. %$* 284
there's a catastrophic humanitarian situation in syria. %$* 284
more than 100,000 syrians have been killed in the last two and a half years, all civilians, 1.8 million syrian refugees outside the country in iraq and turkey and in jordan in refugee camps, 6.8 million people in need of humanitarian support and of those people, 4.5 million have lost their home in syria. %$* 284
they're on the roads. %$* 284
they're trying to find a place to live. %$* 284
they've lost their jobs. %$* 284
secretary of state-- %$* 284
former secretary of state madeline albright is here. %$* 284
and she and i were in morocco a couple of months ago. %$* 284
we met with the u.n.envoy for syria, lakhdar brahimi. %$* 284
he told us something i don't think-- %$* 284
i won't forget. %$* 284
it was very arresting. %$* 284
he said, “syria is melting away because of this humanitarian crisis.” so, do we have a dog in the fight? %$* 284
we want to help the syrian people who have been brutalized by their own regime. %$* 284
that's the first reason. %$* 284
the second reason is geography. %$* 284
look at the map. %$* 284
syria is a neighbor to very important friends and allies of the united states. %$* 284
it's a neighbor to israel. %$* 284
it's a neighbor to turkey, to iraq, to jordan, and to lebanon. %$* 284
so, its central strategic position in the levant, in the heart of the middle east, in the heart of the arab world-- %$* 284
it means that what happens there really matters to the united states and especially to our ally, israel. %$* 284
and third, syria matters to the united states because who is arming and aiding and financing this regime? %$* 284
it's our enemy, iran. %$* 284
and its partner hezbollah. %$* 284
and it's our adversary, russia. %$* 284
so, if assad wins, iran and hezbollah become infinitely stronger. %$* 284
and that puts israel, the united states, and all of our moderate arab friends at a distinct strategic disadvantage. %$* 284
do we have a dog in this fight? %$* 284
you better believe we have a dog in this fight. %$* 284
nigel and i support what president obama has been trying to do, what the united kingdom government has been trying to do, the coalition of countries: the united states, the european countries, turkey, nearly all the arab countries, supported by israel-- %$* 284
who all want to see the following happen-- %$* 284
no one wants to put american troops on the ground in syria. %$* 284
president obama has said resolutely he won’t do that. %$* 284
but this coalition is trying to do the following. %$* 284
they're trying to launch an intensified international effort. %$* 284
it has been too weak so far. %$* 284
it needs to be strengthened to support the moderate rebels and the majority of the syrian population who support the rebel movement. %$* 284
they're trying to organize more effective humanitarian aid. %$* 284
we the americans have given a lot. %$* 284
others need to do more. %$* 284
but it needs to get to the refugees. %$* 284
this group is trying to illuminate-- %$* 284
for international judgment and inspection-- %$* 284
assad's war crimes, his brutalization of his own people and his use of chemical weapons. %$* 284
and this coalition as well, is seeking now to build a transitional government-- %$* 284
formed by the rebel movement-- %$* 284
that would be a government that can compete with the assad regime for political support through which we can give humanitarian aid. %$* 284
and president obama's former syria coordinator, fred hoff, testified before congress on july 17th that that should be now the central objective of this coalition. %$* 284
they want to support a political process that eventually-- %$* 284
over time-- %$* 284
and it's going to take a long time-- %$* 284
to make sure that assad can leave, that a new and more stable transitional government can take his place. %$* 284
it won't be perfect. %$* 284
they'll go through all sorts of ups and downs and frustrations. %$* 284
but at the end of the day-- %$* 284
and maybe it's a year or two or three from now-- %$* 284
there's a better, more humane government in power in damascus. %$* 284
what are the advantages to what president obama is trying to do? %$* 284
it helps the refugees. %$* 284
it supports the great majority of the population in syria who are opposed to assad. %$* 284
it has wide international support. %$* 284
it opposes iran, hezbollah, and russia. %$* 284
it has america leading-- %$* 284
but politically, keeping our troops out of harm's way. %$* 284
this is going to be difficult. %$* 284
it's going to be enormously complex. %$* 284
i think we'll see a lot of setbacks. %$* 284
it is not - - and i'm sure graham or richard will point this out-- %$* 284
without its risks. %$* 284
but there is a greater risk of inaction. %$* 284
the status quo is unacceptable. %$* 284
i've got 30 seconds? %$* 284
the status quo is-- %$* 284
thank you. %$* 284
thank you, john. %$* 284
we concede back the eight seconds of the-- %$* 284
the status quo here that i've just described-- %$* 284
is unacceptable for americans. %$* 284
we cannot stand by and let this happen. %$* 284
no american troops on the ground. %$* 284
but yes to america having a dog in this fight. %$* 284
thank you. %$* 284
thank you, nick burns. %$* 13
the status quo is unacceptable. %$* 284
i've got 30 seconds? %$* 284
no, no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
the status quo is-- %$* 284
oh, you do. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 284
thank you, john. %$* 284
you know, now you got 45 seconds. %$* 13
we concede back the eight seconds of the-- %$* 284
the status quo here that i've just described-- %$* 284
is unacceptable for americans. %$* 284
we cannot stand by and let this happen. %$* 284
no american troops on the ground. %$* 284
but yes to america having a dog in this fight. %$* 284
thank you. %$* 284
thank you, nick burns. %$* 13
the jury will disregard my interruption of nick burns. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i confused myself with that seven minute clock before. %$* 13
so, a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters. %$* 13
two teams of two. %$* 13
fighting it out over this motion-- %$* 13
the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
you've heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
speaking in support of the motion, that the u.s. has no dog in the fight in syria, i want to introduce richard falkenrath. %$* 13
he is a principal with the chertoff group, adjunct senior fellow for counterrorism and homeland security at the council on foreign relations. %$* 13
former deputy homeland security adviser. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 119
i must just start by saying, this is an immensely difficult and tragic problem. %$* 119
and it's very hard to take clear positions when something is so difficult and hard to solve. %$* 119
i will say, however, that there are some things that divide the two sides of the debate. %$* 119
and one, as my colleague graham said, is really what it means to have a dog in the fight. %$* 119
and we stand for a view which says it means you have a vital and national interest at stake which makes it so compelling that you lead and do whatever is necessary to make sure that your vital interests are protected. %$* 119
and we don't think that exists in syria. %$* 119
graham made the case in summary for us. %$* 119
there are many things that we are doing as a country, that we could do, that we should do. %$* 119
we heard some of those from nick. %$* 119
we may hear some more from nigel. %$* 119
but the real question before us is is the interest engaged in syria so vital that we must lead and be centrally involved and possibly intervene militarily to remove assad from power? %$* 119
and we think the answer to that, unfortunately, is no. %$* 119
graham made the argument in summary. %$* 119
i want to elaborate it in three ways. %$* 119
first, to give you a little bit of ground truth about this conflict. %$* 119
second, talk about chemical weapons. %$* 119
and third, the issue of supplying light arms. %$* 119
on the ground truth in the conflict-- %$* 119
this is not a simple conflict of good versus evil, though assad certainly is evil. %$* 119
and it is not a single conflict. %$* 119
this is many different conflicts. %$* 119
and frankly, a fatal flaw in nick and nigel's position here is there is no opposition for us to support. %$* 119
you'd think that if you had a dog in the fight, you could at least have a name for the dog on the other side. %$* 119
but it's not good enough to say the syrian people or the syrian opposition, because the fact is, there is no unified opposition. %$* 119
and there is no connection between the mostly exile-based political leadership and the fighters on the ground. %$* 119
i-- %$* 119
we're so draconian on time. %$* 119
i can't really go through all the different factions of syrian fighters and political entities at the moment. %$* 119
but there's the syrian free army, the syrian liberation front, the syrian islamic front, the al-nusra front, various kurdish groups, independent groups-- %$* 119
all of whom are, in fact, umbrella groups of smaller numbers of fighters out there in the field running their own operations. %$* 119
and in that context, we-- %$* 119
there are also organizers, the national coalition, who are mostly outside of the country, not connected to the fighters on the inside, and not able to dictate what happens on the ground. %$* 119
and so, this is a real problem. %$* 119
if you want to have a dog in the fight, to not have the slightest idea who it is, and to hope that it will come together. %$* 119
and in fact, the most effective and vicious and aggressive fighters in this conflict are ones with whom we would never side. %$* 119
the one-- %$* 119
the last one i mentioned was the al-nusra front. %$* 119
this is a wing of al-qaeda. %$* 119
it has sworn allegiance to ayman zawahiri. %$* 119
so, yes, we-- %$* 119
now, so we have-- %$* 119
we really have two dilemmas in syria. %$* 119
we've got assad aligned with hezbollah, a shi'ite extremist terrorist group. %$* 119
and the most effective and operationally effective opposition group being one who is completely anathema to us to the point that we've designated them a foreign terrorist organization. %$* 119
so, how can you have a dog in the fight when you can't even identify the dog? %$* 119
second, on chemical weapons-- %$* 119
assad has a massive chemical weapons arsenal-- %$* 119
comprised primarily of nerve gas-- %$* 119
sarin, dx, and mustard gas. %$* 119
can't go into the details of what it is, where it is. %$* 119
it's not in a condition that can be easily and quickly used, but it is very dangerous. %$* 119
one of the dilemmas we face here is that it is currently controlled by the assad regime and the alawite sect. %$* 119
and we do have-- %$* 119
maybe a vital interest-- %$* 119
certainly a very strong interest in ensuring these weapons are not transferred to hezbollah and they are not used against israel, turkey, our allies in the gulf, our own forces. %$* 119
and unfortunately, this is actually a sort of restraint on our power. %$* 119
most of the more aggressive forms of intervention and keeping the military balance in the favor of the rebels will lead-- %$* 119
at least temporarily-- %$* 119
to a loss-- %$* 119
a higher risk of loss of control of the chemical weapons. %$* 119
we cannot forget that. %$* 119
finally, on-- %$* 119
and i want to say something about what i'd call the moral hazard of half- measures. %$* 119
we have-- %$* 119
as an unfortunate leitmotif in american foreign policy-- %$* 119
which is every so often, we give support and comfort to groups with which to rise up against an autocrat. %$* 119
and then we get cold feet and leave them dangling. %$* 119
and we did that in hungary in 1956. we did it in the bay of pigs in '61, in prague in 1968, in southern iraq in 1991. %$* 119
and we need to be very careful about small half measures in steps which are-- %$* 119
really have no prospect of success but do make us complicit in the violent outcome which we really cannot control and cannot dictate. %$* 119
and so for that reason it strikes me as that, yes, of course, we should stay involved and engaged diplomatically, and politically there is room for that, but to begin a process of arming a number of rebel groups we can't even control, and don't know, and, frankly, don't trust, i think, is a very dangerous first step since we really are not ready to go the distance. %$* 119
and, in fact, very few people, and certainly none of them on this panel i think, are truly ready to go the distance, which, by the way, we all would be if it were a vital national interest. %$* 119
and that's the essence of the problem here. %$* 119
we want to make it better but it really is not so vital to allow us to be ready to do everything it takes to get the outcome that would be better for us and the region. %$* 119
thank you. %$* 119
thank you, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and here to speak as our final opening statement debater against the motion, nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
he served as british ambassador to the u.s.and as foreign policy and defense advisor to prime minister tony blair. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
well, thank you very much, john, and my thanks to intelligence squared for initiating an important debate. %$* 285
and it's a great honor for me to be here with my three distinguished fellow panelists. %$* 285
now, i just want to go back to the motion. %$* 285
i'm a brit, and i think i know something about the english language. %$* 285
and to me having no dog in the fight in syria means something very simple. %$* 285
it means that you don't-- %$* 285
you're not concerned. %$* 285
you don't have an interest, and you won't be affected by the outcome. %$* 285
that's my dictionary definition, and i think if you look it up, that's what you'll find. %$* 285
i agree that the other side want to do something in syria. %$* 285
the question is, "how important is this issue? %$* 285
how much does it affect american interests, european interests, world interests, and is there some sensible way through in a world where things are much more complicated than they were in 1990 when we had the kuwait conflict, where we have to deal in gray as much as in black and white, and where we risk paralysis if we don't try to do something rather than be paralyzed. %$* 285
so my suggestion would be that the united states does indeed have a strategic interest in what happens in syria. %$* 285
i don't know that i can meet the very high bar that graham and our other colleague have mentioned in relation to an american intervention, whether this is important or not. %$* 285
and the proposers of this motion do want america to stand back. %$* 285
i would say that in today's world you're dealing with complex changes within countries, you're dealing with situations of extremism, instability, you're dealing with a humanitarian tragedy here in syria, and you have to work out whether there's some recipe which has a reasonable chance of success. %$* 285
and the best need not be the enemy of the good in deciding that. %$* 285
i don't think, too, that we can wait for the perfect opposition party, some jeffersonian democratic ideal to be formed in syria. %$* 285
we don't have perfect opposition parties in our own countries, let alone in syria or elsewhere in the middle east. %$* 285
we've got to go with the situation on the ground in the middle east at the moment, where there is a huge amount of uncertainty, and we have to decide whether we understand that dictators like assad will at some point or other be swept away. %$* 285
and whether we’re prepared just to sit it out, and do very little to achieve a much better outcome. %$* 285
as nick said earlier, the status quo really isn’t sustainable for the united states, for britain, and for our other allies, and that’s where i really part company with graham and with richard. %$* 285
if assad stays in power, iran, russia, and hezbollah are going to win. %$* 285
the vast majority of the syrian population are going to be in revolt. %$* 285
the longer this goes on the conflict in syria is going to spill over into the rest of the region. %$* 285
the split between the sunni and the shia within islam is going to expand. %$* 285
and speaking certainly for my country, we've seen a radicalization of our muslim population because of syria. %$* 285
it's become a recruiting sergeant for radicals around the world. %$* 285
and those young men and perhaps women are going to go to syria and pick up a whole load of skills in violence and in terrorism, which will be re-imported into our own countries and threaten us very directly. %$* 285
and i think that's a real risk for the u.k., for the u.s., and for others. %$* 285
i spent nearly 36 years in the british diplomatic service. %$* 285
i believe in the transatlantic partnership. %$* 285
i think that there's little good that happens in the world if europe and america are not standing together. %$* 285
and i and my compatriots are friends of this country. %$* 285
but i do worry about america's credibility and standing if we just sit this one out. %$* 285
president obama talked last year about red lines and a game changer if syria were found to have used chemical weapons. %$* 285
we now know that chemical weapons were used by the assad regime in the conflict. %$* 285
this administration, my government, many other governments have said unequivocally over the months that assad must go. %$* 285
so what happens if he stays? %$* 285
is that without any consequence? %$* 285
at the very least iran is going to be watching and is going to draw a conclusion about american resolve and determination. %$* 285
russia and china will be watching. %$* 285
if this audience wants to sustain american leadership of a new kind after the difficult decade that we've had, then i think we need an active, concerted, comprehensive policy in syria, and not be defeated by the fear that anything we do will suck us in militarily. %$* 285
and as nick has said, that does not need to happen. %$* 285
we've got a program which addresses the humanitarian problem, which accepts that this opposition is not perfect, but there is a national coalition which has formed, which-- %$* 285
with which the u.s. government recognizes as the alternative government of syria, which the european governments and arab league governments see in that role as well. %$* 285
and there are still moderate rebel forces in the form of the free syria-- %$* 285
channel arms through as a way of changing the situation on the ground, which is what we've got to do. %$* 285
assad will not move by himself. %$* 285
it will require persistent determined pressure over a range of areas, diplomatic, humanitarian, and then with these limited arms supplies from the united states and indeed from other arab countries. %$* 285
so to my mind that is a dog in the fight. %$* 285

that’s number one, people vote for double negatives when they think they’re voting for the triple negative. %$* 182
there is, it is in california %$* 182
this is not a statement against representative democracy as the founding fathers of the nation said. %$* 182
i’m—this is a statement against direct democracy as practiced in california, where the legislature is hobbled, because it cannot amend initiatives, and it is unique in that respect. %$* 182
in california it is the least informed way of making decisions. %$* 182
other people have said tonight, it is curious how often the tough-on-crime voters vote for longer prison terms but forget the taxes to pay for larger prisons. %$* 182
vote for faster trains, for smaller school classes, for all these things and somehow forget, not only to vote for the taxes, but then also vote for prop. %$* 182
13 so that they can’t even be raised. %$* 182
taxes can be raised in california— %$* 187
lawrence o’donnell— %$* 13
—property taxes are the only taxes affected by proposition 13 and what it tells you is how much they can be raised. %$* 187
when proposition 13 came along and said you know what, you’re sitting here, you’re living in your house, you might be on a fixed income, your house may have gone up in value dramatically over the years while you’re sitting in—living on that fixed income. %$* 187
and now we cannot just come in and raise your property taxes 25 percent next year, they put a limit in how much you could raise them. %$* 187
proposition 13 allows them to be raised, and the income tax, is sitting there, ready to be legislated at any time and the income tax is the fair way to fund government because it is based on your ability to pay. %$* 187
property taxes are not based on your ability to pay, and california does make a mistake in not raising its income taxes and making them more progressive, raising top- end income taxes significantly, because, those income taxes are deductible on federal income tax returns which means at the top rate, 50 percent of that money is actually being pulled out of what the federal government would’ve taken for taxation. %$* 187
and you can, through a higher top-end income tax in california rebalance this relationship to the federal government’s take on california’s wealth. %$* 187
taxes can be raised— %$* 187
okay— %$* 13
—they’ve never passed a bill saying taxes— %$* 187
bobby— %$* 13
—cannot be raised— %$* 187
—bobby shriver to respond. %$* 13
i just want to make one small quibble, actually it’s a large quibble with gray which is—he used the phrase, “voters put these initiatives on the ballot.” the real harsh truth i’m afraid is that voters do not put the initiatives on the ballot. %$* 186
there’s an—in fact a huge industry, which are in effect sort of semi-private legislatures %$* 186
you really have to think about that. %$* 186
there are people who are very well-financed, may not even live in california, who can hire teams of people, which is a business, a big business, to write legislation for the state. %$* 186
they’ve had every conceivable, you all probably know, ridiculous things that have been put on and defeated. %$* 186
and some ridiculous things have been passed because people as andreas was saying, can’t figure out the syntax, i’m a lawyer, and i can’t figure out some of them, the book that comes to you when you vote is that big, and you’re expected to read in very fine print those documents. %$* 186
and the correlative to this idea is the deprofessionalization honestly of the legislature itself which is to some extent the function of the term limits law which is going to be extended— %$* 186
passed by initiative. %$* 182
indeed. %$* 186
but the point there is that you have these permanent, semi-private, or entirely private groups of people, whose business it is every year, to make law for the state, who— %$* 186
so are you making the argument— %$* 13
no, and i want to say a second thing now that i hear van’s dulcet tones. %$* 186
we’re— switching gears a little bit to the— %$* 186
i’m just shocked to hear a california— %$* 185
—it—i just want to say that, what is the state, and i thank you for saying that the “first” point is a frivolous point which i entirely agree with. %$* 186
what is a state if it’s not the creator of the vision of the state. %$* 186
when van says we’re having a crisis, i—to me, i was ready to get up and walk because we win. %$* 186
no, no, no. %$* 185
if there’s a crisis, that requires— %$* 186
—a constitutional— %$* 186
—resolve the crisis— %$* 185
—a vision we have not yet agreed what the state of california is, that’s a—that’s the ultimate political failure. %$* 186
because—and that’s why a constitutional convention probably will pass and that’s why— i mean, here’s the thing, that i always loved, was in the declaration of independence, not a constitutional convention but an important document nonetheless. %$* 186
everybody knows the first sentence. %$* 186
right? %$* 186
“all men are created equal,” very few people remember the last sentence, which is, “to these truths we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor”— %$* 186
and our sacred honor. %$* 185
that’s the last sentence. %$* 186
and i defy you, today, to get— and the people who signed it, george washington, richest guy in the country. %$* 186
thomas jefferson— %$* 186
let’s, let’s bring in van— %$* 13
no—i’m just saying, i want to finish— can you get the citizens of california to sign a pledge— %$* 186
bobby, let’s hear from the—let’s bring in the other side— %$* 13
—today, to lives and fortunes, lawrence maybe would sign it— %$* 186
gray davis— %$* 13
my good friend bobby who i appointed to the parks commission before his relative, kicked him off the parks commission— %$* 183
and my relative fired me. %$* 186
bobby, i want you to know that— %$* 183
thankfully he also fired clint eastwood on the same day— %$* 186
—the entire— the entire %$* 183
it’s true. %$* 186
group in favor of this proposition— %$* 183
and governor davis did in fact appoint me, thank you— %$* 186
the entire group on my right in favor of this proposition all lives in bobby shriver’s district, so %$* 183
little cabal over there %$* 183
i want to make two points. %$* 183
the constitutional convention is proposed by the bay area business council. %$* 183
yes. %$* 185
apple. %$* 183
google. %$* 183
hewlett-packard. %$* 183
facebook. %$* 183
because they think, sacramento is not acting properly. %$* 183
and to get the constitutional convention on the ballot, they have to get the signature of several hundred thousand californians. %$* 183
so people do put initiatives on the ballot. %$* 183
now is it a perfect system, no, and do we have a lot of shysters out there, misrepresenting what’s on the ballot, absolutely. %$* 183
my, one of my %$* 183
a sister of a dear friend of mine signed the recall petition against me. %$* 183
and i said how could that be and she said because— %$* 183
she voting here tonight? %$* 186
signature gatherer said oh, this is good for teenagers, this is good for teenagers. %$* 183
so, you know, there are flaws in the system. %$* 183
but people do put the initiatives on the ballot, people will solve the problem through the open primary and the constitutional convention, and i have great faith that van will wisely use the remainder of our time. %$* 183
well, i just wanted to point out this is classic california. %$* 185
here you have the people who are saying, the ballot initiative is terrible, it’s awful, we’ve gotta get rid of it. %$* 185
so we’re going to use the ballot initiative to get the constitutional convention that we want. %$* 185
that’s exactly the beauty of the system that we have. %$* 185
is that we, in california we have big problems but we also have big tools to solve those problems. %$* 185
and, i would, i’m shocked to hear— %$* 185
are you, are you really defending the— %$* 184
yes— %$* 185
—the legislative system— %$* 184
i—first of all, first of all— %$* 185
—the—and the initiative system, really— %$* 184
i’m shocked to hear a california politician arguing publicly that the people of california should give up their ability to participate in california’s governance which is basically what you’re saying. %$* 185
we— %$* 185
not exactly but go ahead— %$* 186
— so— %$* 185
sophistry. %$* 182
not exactly but go ahead— %$* 186
i would be happy and i think most of us here would be happy to see some curtailment of some of the abuses of the initiative process but i think, in california we should be proud. %$* 185
you say that people are ill-informed, et cetera, well that’s true about, you know, people going into the malls and making purchases. %$* 185
there’s no such thing as perfect information, but in california, every time we have one of these moments, people know their voice will matter, they will get a chance to vote directly on some of these issues, and we could not solve the problems that you’re describing, without the best thinking of all the people in california— %$* 185
let me go to another— %$* 13
not an impasse— %$* 186
—let me get— %$* 13
—can i just, i have to say one little thing. %$* 186
it’s gotta be really, really little— %$* 13
i—it’s really— i didn’t say the people were ill-informed. %$* 186
i said i %$* 186
am ill-informed. %$* 186
i can’t read. %$* 186
i went to yale law school with you. %$* 186
i can’t read %$* 186
the thing that comes in my post office box, i’m ill-informed. %$* 186
so— %$* 186
i want to stipulate that this side of the panel agrees with bobby’s last statement. %$* 187
we rehearsed that, we rehearsed that. %$* 186
i want to go to another que—also i want to point out that lawrence o’donnell’s tactic of playing with the word “first” has been tried here before, we had a debate on whether george w.bush was the worst president of the last 50 years, here in new york city. %$* 13
karl rove spent the whole night talking about jimmy carter. %$* 13
and he won the debate. %$* 13
so whether it works tonight is up to you, one more question, just down, this gentleman, yeah, with the laser. %$* 13
i’d just like to ask both of you whether you think california will go bankrupt. %$* 9
and if it does go bankrupt does that mean it’s a failed state. %$* 9
great question. %$* 13
i’ll answer that— %$* 183
gray davis. %$* 13
i can say with no fear of contradiction that it won’t, because, it can’t. %$* 183
it can’t legally go bankrupt but more importantly %$* 183
it’s technically true. %$* 183
more importantly— it’ll work its way out of these problems and if you’re thinking of buying a california bond, i can assure you that the legislators understand the importance of lending to get them through these tough times. %$* 183
bonds come not after schools, the first dollar goes to schools, that comes in the door, the second dollar goes to pay go bonds, the third dollar’s the school, the fourth dollar— so as long as we have about 60 cents on the dollar in sacramento we probably have about 85 to 95 percent extension now. %$* 183
your bonds are in good hands. %$* 183
buy california bonds. %$* 183
andreas kluth. %$* 13
vote no in the proposition. %$* 183
he just made a— %$* 182
i hope he’s covered for his investment advice. %$* 186
andreas— %$* 13
you just heard a great answer if you were wondering whether you should buy municipal bonds in california then you might. %$* 182
remember—because, it’s true, technically, legally a state cannot go bankrupt. %$* 182
the order of payments is indeed correct. %$* 182
remember that california has the worst credit rating of the 50 states %$* 182
that is a superlative. %$* 182
it has just been lowered to one notch above junk, by the time this debate is over it probably is junk, so— even in the order of payments that you’ve just heard which was correct, it may indeed go, you know, the bonds may indeed default, which we don’t even need to prove, to carry our motion. %$* 182
well, dana—i just—i want to—dana, do we have time for one more? %$* 13
okay, i’d like to get to one more question with your indulgence be—just to hear from the people. %$* 13
anybody high, i %$* 13
arbitrary left side, right side, right here, sure. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i’d like to get the panel to focus on the task at hand and i think the task at hand is ours. %$* 9
we are being asked to cast a one-word answer, a vote, to a six-word question. %$* 9
and the six-word question is, “california is the first failed state” and i’d like to focus the panel on the word “is.” are we being asked to decide whether california at eight p.m. %$* 9
on january 19th, 2010, is failed, now, or are we being asked to cast a vote on whether you think, the proposition is that california is now and will be irredeemably or for some time to come, a failure— %$* 9
sir, can i just ask you to do something because this’ll be broadcast in different times and different places and rather than say, at eight p.m., would you mind just restating, the—in a very short way— and i might suggest you could say right now at this moment as we stand here, or something along that— %$* 13
you’re in show business now. %$* 187
you’re in show business. %$* 186
let me do another take— %$* 9
show business. %$* 186
everybody’s a director. %$* 9
right now as we stand here. %$* 9
do—should i just say that, or do you want to repeat the whole thing— %$* 9
you know what? %$* 13
i give up, let’s go to the question. %$* 13
which side would like to take this first, lawrence o’donnell— %$* 13
well, i just want to check up here where it was determined that concentrating on the word “first” is frivolous. %$* 187
what’d you make of that one. %$* 187
it depends on what the meaning of “is” is. %$* 13
no, i think, i— not at all, i— %$* 184
sharon waxman— %$* 13
we’re clearly saying, from a position of people who live in california, who believe in california, who’ve spent—who have decided to spend our lives there, that california is currently a failed state, it makes me very sad to hear the other side of the panel %$* 184
giving, paying truly lip service to the notion that yeah, it has some problems. %$* 184
talk—that’s about the understatement of this century, this early part of the century or the new decade. %$* 184
if you live in california and you read the news every day, it is a litany of failures, rogue laws, gridlocks, budget %$* 184
pick your billion, 20 billion this week, 30 billion last— three—six months ago, whatever the hole is that has to be filled, the latest service to be cut, the latest milk and cookies that will not be served. %$* 184
it is— this is the lives of the people of the state of california, it’s not a joke. %$* 184
it’s not, how bad is new york or how bad is arkansas. %$* 184
it is—this is where we are spending our lives, and for us to be arguing this, it is because we believe that california does hold the promise of being the greatest state in the nation, not because we believe it is irredeemably failed and cannot be saved. %$* 184
but to hear people who are in our government, on the other side of, of the panel, suggesting that it’s all cheer, cheery and roses, is very disheartening i have to say for me as a resident of the state, the state is stuck. %$* 184
and it is not working, and if you live there, and if you pay attention at all, you have to know that. %$* 184
i’d like to respond to that— %$* 183
gray davis. %$* 13
i have a lot of respect for sharon. %$* 183
you do? %$* 184
but i want to— but i’m— %$* 183
i’m so touched— %$* 184
—i’m married to one out there, with me, sharon davis, but, sharon waxman, but %$* 183
you are the reason— i have a lot of respect for sharon davis. %$* 183
and a lotta love for sharon davis. %$* 183
as do we all. %$* 187
but you’ll still vote for our side— %$* 184
but here’s the point. %$* 183
i think you can see it in your first sentence. %$* 183
we live in california. %$* 183
we believe in california. %$* 183
we know it will solve its problems and get better. %$* 183
from 1998 to 2008, according to the wall street journal two days ago, california’s economic growth was 25 percent, the rest—the national average was 16 percent, that’s real after inflation adjustments. %$* 183
everywhere you look, people are doing their best to make this world a better place in california, and they’re doing it in other states as well. %$* 183
we are doing the best we can, in a very difficult time. %$* 183
i’m sure sharon has noticed that there’s a national recession. %$* 183
we have 10 percent unemployment, there are problems all over america. %$* 183
we are bigger than other states and the problems sometimes are bigger in california. %$* 183
but they’re not too big for us to solve, and along the way, we are contributing enormous productivity and innovation to america. %$* 183
and i suggest to you, as we get more global, we’re going to rely more and more on states that can innovate. %$* 183
because you can’t out-source an idea, until someone invents it. %$* 183
and that concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are, we are now about to go into round 3 where we will hear brief statements, closing statements from each of the debaters in turn. %$* 13
they’ll be two minutes each. %$* 13
and this is their last chance to change your minds before you vote again. %$* 13
from the live audience vote beforehand, we know where you stood before the debate began, here again are the results, the results before the debate on the motion, “california is the first failed state,” 31 percent of you agreed with the motion, you were for it, 25 percent were against it, and 44 percent were undecided, you’ll be asked to vote again in a short, few minutes from now, but, on to round 3, closing statements from each of the debaters in turn and speaking first, against the motion, lawrence o’donnell, senior political analyst for msnbc and former democratic chief of staff of the us senate committee on finance. %$* 13
first failed state— %$* 187
oh, lawrence, you can—the—we sit on all of these. %$* 13
okay, sorry— %$* 187
sure, no problem. %$* 13
i thought %$* 187
i’m sorry, i’m from the state where words matter. %$* 187
same with you. %$* 187
so some people have doubts about what does “is” mean, that’s a familiar question. %$* 187
some people have doubts that “first” should be in here which is to say, it’s allowable then if we drop “first” that there are other states doing things much worse than the california government is doing things. %$* 187
in the fiscal years that cover this current recession, 2009 through the 2010 fiscal years, states have faced $256 billion in budget gaps %$* 187
nationwide, $256 billion. %$* 187
they’ve solved $73.1 billion of those budget gaps so far. %$* 187
they have a lot of work to do to close those gaps, this is one of those states, where we sit right now. %$* 187
now, california, in its riches, just like new york in its riches, has been generous. %$* 187
it has a medicaid formula that is more generous than other states. %$* 187
if you’re on medicaid in california you get more benefits at a higher level of income, the high—the income cutoff is a higher level than in these other states. %$* 187
and so if you want to say to alabama, go ahead, alabama, keep it up %$* 187
keep it up, don’t let people have medicaid—or if they make as much as $15,000 a year for a family of four, don’t let them have it. %$* 187
if you want to vote that way, and say, i’m going to penalize the state that has tried and in its trying, has to struggle then in this anti-tax environment in this country of raising the money to pay for what it has promised, and then ends up in this very difficult fight every year about how do we balance this budget that doesn’t seem to be balanceable— which is exactly what happens in this state every year, exactly what happens. %$* 187
if you want to penalize those governments, those liberal governments over generations of liberal advance in social programs, for overfunding health care for the poor if you want to call it that, because now it has to be cut back, or overfunding public education because now it has to be cut back under these burdens that they face today, then go ahead. %$* 187
penalize those states. %$* 187
declare here tonight, that alabama has done a better job than california— %$* 187
okay, sorry— %$* 187
first failed state— %$* 187
lawrence o’donnell, your time is up, thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion, “california is the first failed state,” summarizing his position in favor of this motion, the economist’s west coast correspondent, andreas kluth. %$* 13
i don’t want to summarize it because, i don’t think i need to, i want to say thank you to you, sir, for focusing our, our attention again on the proposition that you’re now deciding in this binary way, “california is the first failed state,” you wanted me to focus on “is” and “first.” california is the first failed—failed state means simply that tonight as we speak it is a failure. %$* 182
it does not mean that, five years from now, it cannot have made a fresh start. %$* 182
in fact, the most important prerequisite for making a fresh start and insuring, just as it came up earlier-- %$* 182
in pat brown’s day, california was not a failure, today it is. %$* 182
things can change, however, you have to take a a vital step first. %$* 182
you have to admit that something has failed for you to change it. %$* 182
this is sort of a microcosm of two organizations in california, one called california forward, one called repair california. %$* 182
the names will tell you nothing what they stand for, one wants to deny that the failure is fundamental and wants to fiddle, wants to fiddle here, fiddle there, muddle along, and hope that it’ll get better, the other is repair california which is the organization now pushing the initiatives for the constitutional convention. %$* 182
they want you to say that the failure is fundamental, and therefore we need a new constitution because ours is unmanageably complex, with 500 amendments %$* 182
in half the time that it took america’s constitution to have 27 amendments, all because of initiatives. %$* 182
the people of california will pass those initiatives calling for a constitutional convention %$* 182
in any poll, opinion poll that you may now read. %$* 182
and that is because the people of california take it for granted, they just assume, there is a consensus that the failure is as of today, in fact there, that california has failed, and that we must start fresh with a new constitution, to prevent it, finally, “first” simply means, the other states, the other 49 have to watch out so they don’t repeat our mistakes. %$* 182
thank you, andreas kluth. %$* 13
making his summarizing statement against the motion that “california is the first failed state,” van jones, former white house special advisor for green jobs and co-founder of the ella baker center for human rights and green for all. %$* 13
well, first of all i just want to say, i do think that the question is properly stated about the present moment. %$* 185
i want to say that, it’s been posed that if you don’t believe that we are in  %$* 185
sub %$* 185
collapse, that we don’t care about the people who are suffering in california, that’s not true. %$* 185
people are suffering in california right now. %$* 185
there are people who are suffering in prisons, way too many people, we’re spending way too much money, they have way too little hope and way too little help when they get out. %$* 185
but, i also know that we have great ideas, we have people throughout the state of california moving restorative justice ideas to fix that. %$* 185
even the governor now says maybe we should make it unconstitutional to spend so much money on prisons, more than we spend on our four-year colleges and universities. %$* 185
when you are looking at how you evaluate any situation in your own life, you look at your problems, you look at your deficits, but you also look at your assets. %$* 185
and as long as you are breathing, as long as you have the ability to confront your problems, you’re not a failure. %$* 185
and, i’m going to say, anybody in this room going through anything, you’re not a failure, until you quit. %$* 185
people in california have not quit, we are moving forward, we are coming together in ways that are extraordinary, and we will solve these problems. %$* 185
and i ask you to vote to support us, to encourage us and say, that we’re not failures, you’re not failures, this country is not a failure, we have problems that we have to solve and we will solve them together. %$* 185
thank you, van jones. %$* 13
making her summarizing statement for our motion, “california is the first failed state,” sharon waxman, editor-in-chief of the wrap.com, an entertainment and media business news source. %$* 13
well, i believe the other side has actually made our point this evening. %$* 184
they’ve said that california is full of innovative people, it’s full of ideas, its culture is rich, that invention is still vibrant in the state and the lifestyle is beautiful. %$* 184
all of that is true and that’s why we all choose to live there. %$* 184
but all of that is despite the fact that the state has failed. %$* 184
and it’s not bec—and we stay there for all those reasons because, we continue to push forward, but not because the state lends a hand, plays its role in providing education, transportation, security, a prison system, a medical system, the things that are the state. %$* 184
that is what we’re here to talk about tonight, it is a very serious matter for those of us who live and who have engaged our lives in the state. %$* 184
and to hear van say that we are coming together in ways that are extraordinary, it sounds really lovely, i have no idea what that means. %$* 184
we’re not coming together, and there’s nothing extraordinary about what’s happening to california as a state except extraordinarily bad, i’m sad to say. %$* 184
so i ask you all to vote for this proposition as a gesture, of not only that we have proved the case, but as a gesture of helping take the step of consciousness, and of moving california toward the right future, which is not the path that it’s on. %$* 184
thank you, sharon waxman. %$* 13
the motion is, “california is the first failed state,” and summarizing his position against the motion, gray davis, the 37th governor of california, also served as lieutenant governor, state controller, and state assemblyman. %$* 13
i want you to vote against the proposition, because the proposition is what it purports to be, california %$* 183
supposedly is the first failed state. %$* 183
by any measure, we are more generous than virtually any other state, i was proud to provide health care to 900,000 youngsters that didn’t have it when i became governor. %$* 183
occasionally there’s talk that maybe we have to reduce that by a little bit. %$* 183
i don’t like it, but we’re living in tough times. %$* 183
as mr. %$* 183
o’donnell said, we’re more generous in our calworks program, we have our own separate welfare program to tag onto what the federal government does. %$* 183
we’re more generous on our health care programs, we supplement what the federal government does. %$* 183
so sometimes in tough times, we’re not able to do all the things we would like to do. %$* 183
but we’re not sitting around moaning and groaning. %$* 183
we’re solving our problems, the people are taking matters into their own hands, i’m confident that they will adopt an open primary, i’m confident that they will give voters the chance to go out and make recommendations to change %$* 183
what’s happening %$* 183
because of the shortcomings of 121 people in sacramento. %$* 183
but i just want to assure you that you’re going to be in very good company if you vote no, time magazine would have you vote no. %$* 183
wall street journal two days ago said, california, failed state, it’s such a big subsidizer of the other states that are in trouble in this country, it oughta secede. %$* 183
now i don’t want us to secede because i don’t think we’re in great shape today. %$* 183
but we’re on our way to being in great shape again, and we’re going to be a very important part of america, going forward in our global economy. %$* 183
so i would ask you to look at the proposition and say to yourself, california’s doing a lot of things better than most other states, i’m not going to say it is the first failed state in america. %$* 183
please vote no, which i think is number 2 on your list. %$* 183
very good, gray davis, thank you. %$* 13
our final speaker, summarizing for the motion that “california is the first failed state,” bobby shriver, santa monica city councilman, and co-founder of one.org and red. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 186
i also appreciated the “is” question. %$* 186
because, and i appreciate also sharon’s seriousness about this matter, i mean we’ve had a little fun, which is great. %$* 186
but the truth is tonight, at this moment, people are suffering in really unimaginable ways, and this is a pretty wealthy crowd, a powerful crowd, we’re here in new york, it’s all good. %$* 186
the people that the government and the sense of political compassion is created to serve are really, really bad in california. %$* 186
calworks that gray mentioned’s about to be defunded entirely. %$* 186
the reason that we have a lot of homeless in people is not because la is big as lawrence suggested. %$* 186
it’s because the policies of the state, don’t work. %$* 186
mental health financing is with the county, housing is with the city. %$* 186
they don’t work together, they haven’t worked. %$* 186
there’s been no progress made, enormous progress has actually been made in new york, on homelessness. %$* 186
despite what other things new york hasn’t done well. %$* 186
i want to reiterate, we’re the optimistic people, we’re not moaning and groaning. %$* 186
we’re not, oh, woe is us, california doesn’t have a lot of brilliant people, a lot of venture capital, a lot of cool companies, we acknowledge all that. %$* 186
we’re not talking about that, we’re talking about the state which is a revenue-collection mechanism. %$* 186
it disperses money to people, to do things that the community wants done. %$* 186
if that isn’t happening, the state, not the people, not our energy, not our optimism, not our tools, none of that, is relevant. %$* 186
it’s a revenue- collection thing based on principles. %$* 186
we are not collecting and distributing the revenue to the most vulnerable people in the state today by an immense margin. %$* 186
the suffering %$* 186
here, is immense. %$* 186
and that’s why you have to vote, to give a wake-up call, to the people who hold the power in the state and the people of california, so that they can feel comfortable to say you know what, we’re optimistic, we’re going to get it done, but we got a problem. %$* 186
thank you, bobby shriver, and that concludes round 3 of our debate. %$* 13
and now it’s time to find out who our winners are, you in the audience will choose our winners, i’m going to ask you to go again to the keypad on the right arm of your seat, at each seat you will register your vote. %$* 13

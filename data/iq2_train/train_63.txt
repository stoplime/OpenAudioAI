without trigger warnings just last week. %$* 260
well, so where does it fit? %$* 19
should it be on campus at all? %$* 19
that my question. %$* 19
no, it shouldn't be. %$* 260
it's a ridiculous-- %$* 260
uh-oh. %$* 13
perversion of-- %$* 260
oh, i think we have a division on the against side. %$* 13
awkward. %$* 13
were you about to say %$* 18
i think i actually am the nation's most prominent faculty supporter of trigger warnings at this point. %$* 259
i use trigger warnings in my classes. %$* 259
i think they are absolutely appropriate. %$* 259
i think they should never be mandatory. %$* 259
but i also think that it is absolutely crucial to create an environment where everybody can participate in a classroom discussion. %$* 259
and part of that is recognizing that we all come into the classroom as whole people who have our own experiences. %$* 259
and so if i am talking about the murder and the desecration of the body of emmett till, i would kind of like to know whether one of my students has just lost a son. %$* 259
and if one of my students has just lost a son, i would talk about emmett till in a different way than i would under other circumstances. %$* 259
i don't think that my free speech is being violated if i make that choice. %$* 259
and so what i do in my classrooms is i say, "a, we're going to be discussing some really hard, difficult stuff. %$* 259
and if that brings up emotional issues or psychological trauma, let's talk about that." %$* 259
so, your partner made the big-boy pants argument, and you're making the opposite of that i think or are you not? %$* 13
are you not? %$* 13
no, i think that-- %$* 259
i think that it's absolutely crucial that people have the-- %$* 259
i-- %$* 259
well, let me put it this way, i think that being called a "racist" is not the worst thing in the world. %$* 259
it's something that has happened to me. %$* 259
i have been on the receiving end of that, and i dealt with it. %$* 259
you can address that. %$* 13
oh, yes, sorry. %$* 259
i-- %$* 259
you know, i've had that experience, and sometimes the people calling me a "racist" were kind of right and sometimes they were kind of wrong. %$* 259
and in either situation, i learned something from it. %$* 259
and i would-- %$* 259
if somebody thinks that i'm a racist, i would far rather have them tell me that than not. %$* 259
all right, let me let your opponents respond to the-- %$* 13
to your argument for those limitations on-- %$* 13
well, do you call those a "limitation on speech," by the way? %$* 13
do you call them a "facilitator" or an "enabler of speech"? %$* 13
which are they? %$* 13
yeah, no. %$* 259
i think that i-- %$* 259
what i call it is a "content note," and i-- %$* 259
it's a way of-- %$* 259
okay. %$* 13
enhancing discussion. %$* 259
it should not be mandatory, and on that we agree. %$* 260
okay, kirsten powers. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 258
i-- %$* 258
well, i mean, this reminds me a little of eric posner, who is a university of chicago law professor, just wrote an article for slate magazine basically arguing that-- %$* 258
in defense of a lot of these different-- %$* 258
of speech codes in particular, and he didn't-- %$* 258
i don't know if he mentioned trigger warnings because he said that what people don't understand is that students today are really our children and that they need to be protected. %$* 258
and that's sort of what is behind this idea-- %$* 258
which, to me, doesn't seem like something that's really encouraging a robust sort of intellectual debate. %$* 258
but look, if you want to do trigger warnings, you can do trigger warnings. %$* 258
the problem that has been raised has been with professors who have been told that they must provide trigger warnings. %$* 258
so, at oberlin, for example, a lot of professors revolted. %$* 258
and the-- %$* 258
university of california, santa barbara, there-- %$* 258
the students were demanding them. %$* 258
and i think that that is a very different thing, especially because, if you look at the list of the things that could potentially trigger something-- %$* 258
students, at oberlin, they said it could literally be anything. %$* 258
and so, how that-- %$* 258
you know, how does that not chill a professor-- %$* 258
of living in fear that they're going to trigger anybody? %$* 258
angus johnston. %$* 13
do trigger warnings make you rage-filled? %$* 18
do you need trigger warnings about? %$* 18
yeah. %$* 258
i guess, two things-- %$* 259
first of all, in terms of the idea that this is infantilizing people-- %$* 259
the person who did the most to make me think about the importance of trigger warnings is actually in the audience here tonight. %$* 259
and she's a combat veteran. %$* 259
so, i don't believe that it's infantilizing. %$* 259
secondly, i would say that in oberlin, there was never a-- %$* 259
it was never proposed as mandatory. %$* 259
yes, students at santa barbara suggested that it should be mandatory, but students suggest things that are not that great of an idea all the time. %$* 259
and in fact, in fact, the student who was behind-- %$* 259
one of the students who was behind the proposal at santa barbara wrote to me privately much later, saying that she thought that my solution was an excellent one, and she thought that the way that i had approached it, which was not mandatory, had advanced the debate in exactly the way she wanted it to be. %$* 259
do we have time for one more question? %$* 13
sir, there. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
you can go ahead, sir. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
i'm casey given with students for liberty. %$* 18
and my question is about-- %$* 18
tonight, a lot of the discussion has been about administrators stifling free speech, but what about students? %$* 18
at my alma mater, the university of california berkeley, recently, members of the occupy movement actually raided a speech by peter thiel, the venture capitalist, and not just raided the speech, but also raided the stage, causing him to flee. %$* 18
so, is this-- %$* 18
is there also not liberal students stifling free speech? %$* 18
i think we somewhat covered it, but if-- %$* 13
because i took that question to kirsten a little bit ago. %$* 13
but do you want to very quickly respond to that? %$* 13
hecklers veto is a horrible thing, and it shouldn't happen, and frankly, it's pretty rare. %$* 259
i would also note, though, if we're talking about the hecklers veto, that one of the situations that springs to my mind is an israeli ambassador a few years ago, at uc irvine, who was not actually prevented from speaking. %$* 259
students heckled him, but they didn't actually succeed in creating a veto. %$* 259
11 students were arrested and charged with misdemeanors for engaging in free speech in that incident. %$* 259
okay. %$* 13
so-- %$* 259
so, one thing i would-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
we're going to conclude this round in a second. %$* 13
but i want to do one thing, since we devoted this time to trigger warnings-- %$* 13
is to relate it to our motion. %$* 13
i just want to go back to the side that's arguing for the motion, that liberals are stifling intellectual diversity, and tell us why trigger warnings-- %$* 13
if trigger warnings actually support your argument, their existence and their implementation-- %$* 13
oh, they absolutely do. %$* 257
greg lukianoff. %$* 13
they absolutely do. %$* 257
they're a liberal idea based on sensitivity. %$* 257
i think they're well- intentioned. %$* 257
i think a lot of speech codes ideas are well-intentioned. %$* 257
but here's my problem with trigger warnings. %$* 257
i wrote a short book called "freedom from speech," and i'm afraid that's kind of where we're headed. %$* 257
and but-- %$* 257
and here's-- %$* 257
and i can go to philosophical reasons why i think trigger warnings are dangerous. %$* 257
but here's the practical reason. %$* 257
because seven humanities professors wrote inside higher education, saying, "oh, my god. %$* 257
these are becoming expectations. %$* 257
they're not mandatory yet, but because they're becoming expectations, i am receiving angry e-mails and angry letters from students and from administrators saying i better provide these." but guess what? %$* 257
it's impossible to know what actually might trigger them-- %$* 257
but why are they liberal? %$* 13
why is it a liberal thing? %$* 13
because it's sensitivity-based-- %$* 257
it's a sensitivity-based warning idea that is absolutely in line with all of the speech codes we've been talking about-- %$* 257
kirsten. %$* 13
the entire time. %$* 257
yeah. %$* 258
well, there was also a new yorker article that was written by a harvard law professor, about the fact that she-- %$* 258
she teaches rape law. %$* 258
and she has been-- %$* 258
had students demand that there be trigger warnings-- %$* 258
or that she not teach it-- %$* 257
and-- %$* 258
well, and the-- %$* 258
and has ultimately sort of culminated with the idea. %$* 258
and she says specifically that this is, you know, perpetrated by left-wing groups who are advising the students, to tell them that they shouldn't have to sit in a rape law class if it's upsetting to them, to the point that she said, surveying various professors across the country, that they are now giving up teaching rape law because of the fear-- %$* 258
okay. %$* 13
of the backlash from-- %$* 258
the students. %$* 258
but let me-- %$* 13
let jeremy mayer respond to-- %$* 13
but could i ask her a question? %$* 260
sure. %$* 13
if a campus said, "we are going to be the campus of sensitivity"-- %$* 260
yeah. %$* 257
and they said that "we're going to do trigger warnings"-- %$* 260
sure. %$* 18
"because of the danger"-- %$* 260
you'd be fine with that, right, because we have, again, in this town catholic university, where students are so sensitive to prochoice. %$* 260
right. %$* 18
that if anyone goes there, even if they're there to talk about acting or cooking have they ever been publicly prochoice? %$* 260
that speech is banned. %$* 260
and what was really ironic about catholic is that they actually used to have relatively good policies on freedom of association. %$* 257
and they tried to start an naacp chapter there, and fire came in trying to-- %$* 257
defending the naacp and holding them to their promises, and then they rescinded all those promises. %$* 257
so it was one of the times where it actually ended up backfiring. %$* 257
but by your own principles, if a campus said we are sensitive to university pc plays, you'd allegedly be okay with that because you're okay when right wing groups set up a campus and say, all right, no pro choice can say-- %$* 260
they can. %$* 257
but if you really take this to its logical extreme, then they couldn't be universities because they literally couldn't talk about anything. %$* 257
but-- %$* 18
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
and now we move on to round three, round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus, greg lukianoff, president of the foundation for individual rights in education. %$* 13
this evening, kirsten and i have provided data and real examples demonstrating how liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 257
but you don't have to take it from us. %$* 257
just ask the professors themselves. %$* 257
in a 2012 study, a representative sample of about 300 social psychologists were asked if two job candidates with equal qualifications were to apply for an opening in your department, and you knew one was politically conservative, would you be inclined to vote for the more liberal one? %$* 257
82 percent of liberal social psychologists said they would at least be a little bit prejudice against the conservative applicant. %$* 257
this is shocking, especially when you consider that social psychologists are so often concerned about the harm of unconscious bias. %$* 257
it can be very hard to get respondents to concede that they might be prejudice. %$* 257
not-- %$* 257
not so apparently with conservatives and christians. %$* 257
it's a well-known rule of social science that the more politically homogenous a group is, the more radical in that direction it tends to become and the more the group begins to act as a tribe that sees outsiders as enemies who are either stupid or simply bad or greedy. %$* 257
unfortunately, we're seeing this play out within our colleges and universities. %$* 257
too many liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus and in doing so, they are encouraging people just to talk with those who they already agreed. %$* 257
there are endless rules for collect speech-- %$* 257
correct speech are encouraging people to keep their opinions to themselves. %$* 257
this only makes the tribalism problem worse and the walls of the echo chamber thicker. %$* 257
it's not supposed to be this way, and it doesn't have to be this way. %$* 257
but the first step towards recovery is admitting you have a problem. %$* 257
and on our campuses, we have a problem. %$* 257
and i hope you will all recognize tonight that liberals sadly are stifling intellectual diversity. %$* 257
thank you. %$* 257
thank you, greg lukianoff. %$* 13
and that is the motion, liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, jeremy mayer. %$* 13
he is co-author of "closed minds, politics and ideology in american universities." %$* 13
a long time ago, i was a republican at brown university. %$* 260
and that was a tough gig. %$* 260
there was social ostracism sometimes. %$* 260
people called me a racist. %$* 260
there are things that you go through with a libertarian-minded republican that i sympathize with. %$* 260
but i don't believe, overall, that liberals are stifling intellectual kinds of diversity. %$* 260
i think a lot of these ideas, even the idea of trigger warnings are creating discussions about trauma and how we talk about it. %$* 260
when i was at college, my first month, a gay student group had a kiss-in in the mailroom. %$* 260
and back in-- %$* 260
'80-- %$* 260
and today that's pretty normal at gw. that happens a lot of-- %$* 260
thursday i think is the gay kiss-in. %$* 260
but in '86, that was revolutionary to see boys or men and men and women and women kissing deeply. %$* 260
it really created a discussion. %$* 260
that's free speech. %$* 260
and was it offensive, was it dangerous? %$* 260
did people-- %$* 260
yeah. %$* 260
but that's what a campus should be. %$* 260
a lot of the things we've heard tonight are anecdotes. %$* 260
the plural of anecdote is not data. %$* 260
there are things that happen on college campuses that i don't approve of, that i don't think a good liberal or for someone committed to free speech should approve of. %$* 260
but you know what? %$* 260
that's what happens when 18 and 21-year- olds are passionate about their beliefs and they engage in a debate that we must desperately have. %$* 260
so, at the end of the day, i think a lot of conservatives are worried that their children are going to change to the left. %$* 260
and i have good news, we don't change children to the left. %$* 260
jennings and stoker in a longitudinal study found that college had absolutely no effect on political views of college students. %$* 260
mariani and hewitt found a small leftward change over time in college students that was exactly mirrored by what happened with the same age group that didn't go to college. %$* 260
so, please consider well that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on college campuses. %$* 260
thank you. %$* 13
jeremy mayer. %$* 13
and that's the motion: liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position supporting this motion, kirsten powers. %$* 13
she is author of "the silencing: how the left is killing free speech." it's due out in may. %$* 13
if you're part of the dominant culture, which, on university campuses-- %$* 258
as we've established-- %$* 258
is primarily liberal-- %$* 258
it's easy to mistake your beliefs for objective truth. %$* 258
it's also easy to imagine there are no reasonable or intelligent people who think differently on important topics, because you're not encountering them. %$* 258
i know this because i've lived most of my life in the liberal bubble. %$* 258
there were two experiences that took me out of this. %$* 258
one was becoming a contributor at fox news. %$* 258
and the other was a later in life conversion to christianity. %$* 258
i can remember actually saying to somebody that i was debating at fox that harriet miers-- %$* 258
who george bush was-- %$* 258
had nominated for the supreme court-- %$* 258
didn't count as a female appointment, because she was a conservative and an evangelical christian. %$* 258
i'm embarrassed, frankly, that i ever thought that. %$* 258
it was a prejudiced view, and unfortunately, i wasn't alone in my prejudice. %$* 258
a 2007 study of faculty on college campuses found that 53 percent had cool or negative feelings towards evangelical christians. %$* 258
these levels of disapproval raise curious questions about how evangelical students are treated on campus. %$* 258
the only way that one could believe that liberals aren't stifling intellectual diversity on campuses is if they never visit fire's website and if they don't have any friendships with non-liberals. %$* 258
at a dinner party a couple weeks ago, i met a retired stanford professor and a harvard law school student-- %$* 258
both evangelicals - - who described to me how they felt they had to hide their beliefs, lest they be ostracized or punished. %$* 258
a third person, who was a former professor at a dc area university, was passed over for a position because she was suspected-- %$* 258
correctly-- %$* 258
of being a conservative. %$* 258
and this was in writing. %$* 258
these stories are all too familiar. %$* 258
i hear them regularly, but people are too afraid to speak publicly. %$* 258
they don't want to lose their jobs or academic careers, and fire receives calls from people like this nearly every single day. %$* 258
i believe you must vote "yes" on this motion tonight: liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campuses. %$* 258
thank you, kirsten powers. %$* 13
the motions, liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion-- %$* 13
angus johnston. %$* 13
founder of the website studentactivism.net. %$* 13
when i was an undergraduate student, involved in various student organizations, i remember feeling afraid to talk about certain issues. %$* 259
i remember feeling like if i said the wrong thing, that i might get yelled at, or maybe somebody would even stop liking me. %$* 259
i remember that that scared me. %$* 259
and i remember that what it did sometimes is make me keep my mouth shut-- %$* 259
which, as a 19, 20, 21-year-old white guy, was maybe not the worst thing that could happen to a person. %$* 259
but the other thing that it did is it made me think more seriously about what i was going to say. %$* 259
it made me chew on the stuff. %$* 259
and sometimes i did think seriously about what i was going to say, and i still said something that offended somebody else. %$* 259
and they let me know it. %$* 259
and here i am today, still alive, still doing okay. %$* 259
part of free speech on campus is people being passionate about the degree to which they abhor what you say. %$* 259
i absolutely think that we need more free speech on campus when we're talking about administrators, and faculty imposing their own values, whether ideological or not. %$* 259
but i also absolutely think that we need to stand up for the right for people to engage in rowdy, obnoxious debate, because rowdy, obnoxious debate is what made me what i am and it's what made a lot of you what you are. %$* 259
so, in standing up for free speech, and standing up for rowdy, obnoxious debate, i would encourage you all to avoid stereotyping who are the people who are censoring and who are the people who are silencing. %$* 259
and the best way-- %$* 259
i was going to say the best way you could do that is vote against this motion, but i don't want to pressure you. %$* 259
i don't want you to feel silenced. %$* 259
so,-- %$* 259
do whatever will make you feel that you are whole and that you are a part of this community, because this is a hell of a community. %$* 259
thank you very much. %$* 259
thank you, angus johnston. %$* 13
and that concludes-- %$* 13
our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you, our audience, feel has argued better here. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat and once again to vote, and we'll get the readout almost immediately. %$* 13
again, the motion is, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." if you agree with this motion, have been persuaded to it, push number one. %$* 13
if you've come out against it, push number two. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll lock it out in about 15 seconds, and we'll have the results in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
while we're waiting for that to happen, i just want to say this, that this was a great exercise in free speech, number one. %$* 13
i know it's a cliché, but it really was-- %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
everybody on this panel-- %$* 13
both panels absolutely believes in that value, and despite your disagreement, which was quite visceral, you brought respect to one another and civility and yet it was robust and it wasn't boring ever. %$* 13
so, congratulations for the way you did that. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we've had a great time at george washington university, and we hope to come back again. %$* 13
and i also want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question in the audience, including the gentleman's question i didn't take. %$* 13
i don't-- %$* 13
i don't mean any disrespect by that at all. %$* 13
in fact, in a-- %$* 13
again, in the spirit of free speech, i hated saying, "no," but come on down afterwards and chat with us because i think that would work. %$* 13
so congratulations, and thanks for everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
so one more round of applause for them. %$* 13
our next debate will be in new york at the kaufman music center. %$* 13
that's our usual home. %$* 13
it's going to be on march 11.that's a wednesday. %$* 13
we're going to be debating whether the u.s.should adopt europe's right to be forgotten online principle. %$* 13
and we'll be debating, having on our stage a global public policy former director from google. %$* 13
we'll have law professors from harvard and the university of chicago, and we'll have the european union commission's director of fundamental rights in citizenship. %$* 13
we really do mean it when we say, "come on up." and if you can't, we'll be livestreaming and of course it'll live on as a podcast and as an npr broadcast. %$* 13
you can find our podcast. %$* 13
we have a really lovely app that we launched this year. %$* 13
it's available in the apple store and the google-- %$* 13
the google store as well for android. %$* 13
and it contains-- %$* 13
you can hear all-- %$* 13
we've now-- %$* 13
this is our 101st debate, and 100 of them are on there. %$* 13
enjoy both the video and visual, and you can also vote and do research, et cetera. %$* 13
so, please take a look at that in our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
and to everybody who joined our live stream today, from wherever you are in the world, thank you. %$* 13
okay, so i have the final results now. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
the motion is this, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus." and, again, reminding you that the way this works is that the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms between the first and second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's look at the first vote on the motion, "liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus," and the first vote, 33 percent supported this motion, 21 percent were against, 46 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
looking now at the second results, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 59 percent. %$* 13
they went from 33 to 59 percent. %$* 13
that's up 26 percentage points, and that is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote was 21 percent, second vote, 32 percent. %$* 13
that's only an 11 percent increase. %$* 13
it means the team arguing for the motion, "liberals are stifling the intellectual diversity on campus," are our winners. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13
thank you, everybody. %$* 13
it was really a pleasure to have-- %$* 13
to be doing this in washington, and, again, it's a cliché, you were a terrific audience, but actually you were a terrific audience. %$* 13
so, thank you. %$* 13

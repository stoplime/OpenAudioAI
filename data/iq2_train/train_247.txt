okay. %$* 13
my sister married a dutch guy. %$* 650
and they were-- %$* 650
their wedding was in amsterdam, about seven or eight years ago. %$* 650
and none of the dutch people at the wedding could care less about pot. %$* 650
all the americans there, including myself, the first thing we did was go to the coffee shops and smoke a bunch of pot. %$* 650
none of the people that lived there were interested at all because it seemed like, you know, they took the excitement out of it. %$* 650
it's been available-- %$* 650
so turn this into a question. %$* 13
turn this into a question. %$* 13
so it's been available to them their whole lives, and it seems to have taken some of the - - some of the thrill away from it. %$* 650
do you think that that would hold true here? %$* 650
would pot stop being cool-- %$* 13
yeah, you know, you take some of the coolness-- %$* 650
you know, if your parents are smoking pot-- %$* 650
let me-- %$* 13
i'm going to take the question first to asa hutchinson. %$* 13
would it take the thrill away and the attraction away? %$* 13
well, perhaps. %$* 448
to legalize it, yeah. %$* 13
i mean, sure, if becomes very common. %$* 448
but let's look more carefully. %$* 448
and i've been to the netherlands, and i've been to the coffee houses. %$* 448
and-- %$* 448
but you know, you-- %$* 448
where you drank coffee. %$* 13
you've got to-- %$* 448
you've got to investigate carefully. %$* 448
but the dutch governments had second thoughts after years of expanding the cannabis cafes. %$* 448
i think they realized that it became a tourist mecca for that purpose, and what you just described. %$* 448
and so the number of dutch marijuana coffee houses dropped from almost 1,200 in 1997 to 782. and so they decreased maybe-- %$* 448
i don't think the-- %$* 448
i think the dutch government-- %$* 448
and in fact many of them-- %$* 448
73 percent of the dutch towns do not allow cannabis cafes. %$* 448
and so i think it was a mistake, the path that they went down. %$* 448
they recognized it. %$* 448
they've retreated from that both in terms of their reputation in the commercial enterprise but also i just think it's the direction that the dutch towns did not want to go down. %$* 448
so i hope we can learn something from that. %$* 448
you talk about availability because it was available. %$* 448
i was actually going through a dutch town with the chief of police, and i had people pulling on my sleeves-- %$* 448
i'm with the chief of police. %$* 448
i'm head of the dea. and they're pulling on my sleeve saying, "do you want some ecstasy? %$* 448
" and i'm saying, "hey, don't you know who i am, who i'm with? %$* 448
" and it doesn't make any difference, because it was available and was legal. %$* 448
paul butler come in. %$* 13
and so there are fewer coffeehouses because there's less of a demand. %$* 645
it turned out in amsterdam, when they made smoking pot legal, fewer kids wanted to do it. %$* 645
it wasn't as cool. %$* 645
so, respectfully, dr. %$* 645
theodore and asa, if you really want kids to stop smoking pot, you should go on tv yourselves and fire up a big juicy blunt. %$* 645
we're being live streamed, and we have a question that's come in to us from washington state via facebook. %$* 13
tom glassman writes, "i’m someone who lives in washington state." he asks, "is the legalization of a drug, for example, marijuana, something that should be left to the states to decide? %$* 13
" who would like to take that question on? %$* 13
nick gillespie. %$* 13
yeah, you know, this is a fascinating political question that the obama administration in particular is going to have to deal with because traditionally the democrats are at least over the past 30 or 40 years and barack obama and actually presidents in general assert the primacy of federal law over every matter no matter what, whether it's funding, or regulations, or whatnot. %$* 646
i would actually-- %$* 646
i guess it's the second best answer to say that drug legalization should be left to localities or to states as opposed to a one size fits all federal solution. %$* 646
by the same token, i do actually think that pharmacological freedom, which includes what a friend of mine calls culinary freedom-- %$* 646
i mean, the right to ingest what you want is pretty fundamental and should probably be respected across the board rather than parceled out, but as a second best option, let's let the states and localities be laboratories of democracy-- %$* 646
asa hutchinson. %$* 13
and what happens to the experiments? %$* 646
asa hutchinson. %$* 13
no. %$* 448
well, we're-- %$* 448
addressing even the washington state situation. %$* 13
whenever arizona experimented and thought they ought to be engaged in enforcement of our immigration laws, president obama's administration filed suit against arizona, asserting the supremacy clause. %$* 448
and so if you-- %$* 448
believing there should be a national standard for such an issue as immigration, i think they're going to have a difficult time not making the same argument in reference to the state's choices on marijuana or other drugs. %$* 448
so it's difficult in our society for states to make choices on that particular issue whenever you have an overriding federal law. %$* 448
i think there's going to be a lawsuit, and i think it'll be resolved in the courts. %$* 448
think we have time for one more question. %$* 13
hi, my name tatiana martushev. %$* 651
i'm in the health care profession. %$* 651
and i mostly deal with pain management. %$* 651
and i have a lot of clients who are getting treatment for cancer, and they actually tell me that their doctors say to them, "listen, the best thing for you is actually just go buy some pot because it's actually much more effective in managing the pain, it's cheaper than the drugs, it's less destructive on their physical bodies than the medically prescribed drugs, and-- %$* 651
and what is your-- %$* 13
what do you think of-- %$* 13
so my question is-- %$* 651
but actually what do you think of that answer? %$* 13
well, when you see people in that kind of pain, you really don't want them to be in that kind of pain, and if the drugs that are legally available aren't really helping them to eat, to manage their pain, et cetera, why not give them something that is readily available to them if they just walk down the street-- %$* 651
okay. %$* 13
and pay someone? %$* 651
okay. %$* 13
take the side arguing against legalization, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
well, i mean, any time a doctor or the american medical society says a patient needs something for pain management, i'll be the first one to sign up for it, i mean, in terms of supporting that position. %$* 448
doctors in the medical profession should determine what's appropriate pain management and care. %$* 448
at this point, the ama has not approved that. %$* 448
maybe they will someday, but they have not done that at this point. %$* 448
and so that's the answer. %$* 448
i don't think that relates to the overall debate question, but it's certainly an appropriate question to ask. %$* 448
other side, response? %$* 13
i had a-- %$* 645
paul butler. %$* 13
a member of my family go through the same experience. %$* 645
he was dying of lung cancer, and his doctor told him that marijuana would be the best thing. %$* 645
he didn't live in a state where medical marijuana was available, and so our family faced the difficult choice of becoming lawbreakers, risking arrest and prosecution, or watching my relative live and die in pain. %$* 645
asa hutchinson, just take 20 seconds to do one thing. %$* 13
you just said that you don't feel that that question relates to the motion, and you've said that a few times on a few questions. %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
why not, for example, the question of medical marijuana? %$* 13
marijuana use for medical uses, which would require-- %$* 13
which would involve legalization of that particular drug. %$* 13
why does that not relate to the motion? %$* 13
well, medical marijuana is a separate and distinct issue. %$* 448
some states put medical marijuana on the ballot, which takes a doctor's prescription or authorization, and so that's not a legalization issue, it is a physician issue and pain management and doctor's care, and giving doctors the ability to prescribe marijuana if they believe that's beneficial, so it's really a separate medical issue versus the legalization across the board. %$* 448
you can decide they need it for pain management, that doesn't need mean that everybody should have marijuana. %$* 448
and the motion does imply all drugs, we're not-- %$* 13
i just want to clarify. %$* 13
can i just ask, quickly, though, because these are lengths, i think, in some significant ways. %$* 646
but when you were the head of the dea, did you support the federal government going in an raiding medical marijuana dispensaries in places like california where it was legal under state law to prescribe or to give a doctor's note for-- %$* 646
and if so, why? %$* 646
i don't actually think that that is on point for the debate, so i'm going to pull that one. %$* 13
you can answer-- %$* 13
come up and approach him afterwards. %$* 13
i don't think it's on the question of whether we should legalize drugs or not. %$* 13
and i can take one very, very, very, very short question and short answer. %$* 13
sir, mic is coming to you down left hand side. %$* 13
could you stand up? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name is now, that statistic you provided in the brochure, that 50 percent decrease in drug use, my question is: how can you say that that's a causal relationship based on the-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
we get the question? %$* 13
asa hutchinson. %$* 13
good question. %$* 13
i mean, i think you can argue it either way, you can say that that's the result of education, it's a result of enforcement efforts. %$* 448
i personally believe that it's the result of all of our community efforts combined. %$* 448
but the point is, you're not going to ever eliminate 100 percent usage of illegal drugs and addicting drugs. %$* 448
and the reason is we have young people, we have addictive personalities. %$* 448
the question is, what is the best way to keep the usage and the abuse at the lowest point for our society? %$* 448
and i think the present mechanisms, while we can tweak it, we can adjust it, we can change our enforcement policies, has worked pretty good in terms of keeping it-- %$* 448
a 9 percent level of use in the last 30 days for all of americans. %$* 448
that's making some progress. %$* 448
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and this is their last chance to try to change your minds. %$* 13
remember you voted before the debate and you will be asked to vote again right after these closing statements and to pick the winner. %$* 13
the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
but, first, onto round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn; they are two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is legalize drugs. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, asa hutchison, former administrator of the drug enforcement administration. %$* 13
thank you for incredible attention to this important topic. %$* 448
today, as i prepared for this debate, i received a call from a family friend in arkansas who is a grown mother, actually has two 30-year-old girls, and she said both of them are on methamphetamine and she simply asked, "what do i do about it? %$* 448
" and so i started asking questions, and one of them actually knew she had a problem and wants to get off; the other one just is going down this path, she's got a supplier, she's got a dealer. %$* 448
and, of course, i started thinking through, "how does legalization impact this very real tragedy that is destroying this home and this family? %$* 448
" and one of the 30 year old daughters has children being neglected. %$* 448
and i could not think of a system of legalization that would make this better, because this person that has a problem will never get the treatment necessary in order to get over that addiction unless they're confronted with it, and probably from a legal standpoint. %$* 448
it is that officer that will say, "ma'am, you've got methamphetamine in your car. %$* 448
you need to get help. %$* 448
we're going to arrest you, or you're going to go to drug court. %$* 448
something's going to happen. %$* 448
and that will change their life. %$* 448
now, if it's not illegal, all that officer can do is say, ma'am, we're going to have to take your children away from you. %$* 448
but you've got a right to keep your methamphetamine. %$* 448
you've got a right to go get some more. %$* 448
you've got a right to continue your abuse pattern. %$* 448
and this could be multiplied over and over again. %$* 448
ladies and gentlemen, this is about legalizing drugs. %$* 448
if you send a signal to our youth of our nation, the next generation, as president barack obama wants to do, that it is illegal, then usage will stay at a modest level, hopefully a declining level. %$* 448
if you legalize it, usage will go up. %$* 448
if you believe it is harmful, then you should vote no on the proposition. %$* 448
thank you very much. %$* 448
thank you, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize drugs." and here to make his closing statement in support of the motion, paul butler, georgetown law professor and former federal prosecutor. %$* 13
thanks first to my great partner and my very worthy opponents. %$* 645
it sounds, though, like i was wrong about how asa would respond to someone who he cares about who has a drug problem, because it does sound like he thinks the best thing to do is to call the police, because he said that's the only way that they'll get help. %$* 645
i just fundamentally disagree with that. %$* 645
i don't think that in order to get treated for a drug problem you should have to admit that you're a criminal. %$* 645
i agree with president obama when he said, during the first campaign, that it's blind and counterproductive to lock up nonviolent drug offenders. %$* 645
if it worked, if it got drugs off the street, then maybe i'd support it. %$* 645
but we know that it just doesn't work. %$* 645
clarence thomas, before he became the first african-american on the supreme court, was a judge in d.c.and he said, when he would look out of the window of his chambers and see all these young black men filing into the criminal court in chains, he would think, "there but for the grace of god go i." my friends, the determination of who goes to criminal court in chains should not be so fortuitous. %$* 645
it should not depend so much on the color of your skin or how much money your parents make. %$* 645
as long as it does, we need to legalize drugs. %$* 645
thank you, paul butler. %$* 13
and that is our motion, legalize drugs. %$* 13
and here to make his closing statement against the motion, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
he is a former prison doctor and the dietrich weissman fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
well, ladies and gentlemen, first, let me just remind you that amsterdam is by far the most violent city in western europe, with a murder rate between 2.5 and 3 times higher than that of paris, for example. %$* 647
and the mayor of amsterdam recently said that he wanted to reinstate the coffee houses because he had this idea that the one and a half people who go there to take cannabis every year, they would go rampaging through the streets if they couldn't get it. %$* 647
i don't think anyone would have said that about smokers, for example, who couldn't smoke in bars. %$* 647
so this suggests that there's a big difference here, a cultural difference. %$* 647
to give you an idea of the-- %$* 647
the utopianism that is behind this motion, let me tell you that the head of the drug agency of the united nations once said that the drugs trade was corrupting west africa. %$* 647
now, if you can believe that, you can believe anything, because when i arrived in lagos airport, the first time i arrived in lagos airport, the customs officer said, have you brought any presents? %$* 647
i said, i don't know anybody in nigeria. %$* 647
he said, "for me." and i soon got the general view. %$* 647
crime is not caused by the illegality of drugs, nor is there illegality that causes the problems to which they give rise. %$* 647
if you vote for this motion, you're saying that the british were the heroes of the opium wars because they opened to the chinese the freedom to take opium. %$* 647
and which they then did on a famous or notoriously large scale. %$* 647
and they stopped actually when mao tse-tung threatened to shoot them. %$* 647
if you believe that the british were liberating the chinese, then you will vote for this motion. %$* 647
but remember that genies do not go back into the bottles when they are commanded to do so. %$* 647
so please vote against the motion. %$* 647
thank you, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
our motion is legalize drugs. %$* 13
and here to make his closing statement in support of the motion, nick gillespie, editor in chief of reason.com and reason tv. %$* 13
let me suggest, contra the opposition, when you consider about legalizing drugs, that in fact it does increase your freedom to be allowed to take lexapro, or to take lipitor or to take lsd.it will not destroy you. %$* 646
i will not turn you into a fried brain, lesser son of timothy leary. %$* 646
it just might make your life a little more interesting, or it's an experience worth having. %$* 646
the status quo in the drug war is untenable and destructive for all of the reasons that my partner outlined. %$* 646
it is always going to be prosecuted. %$* 646
the drug war is always going to be prosecuted against blacks in america, to bring it back to dear old blighty, blacks in america and the drug war are what australians were to the english in world war i. they are human fodder, and they will be ground up and used as-- %$* 646
their bones will be the basis for the next bunker. %$* 646
there is no way around it. %$* 646
the drug war has always been prosecuted along racial lines, along class lines and other discriminatory practices. %$* 646
that's not going to change. %$* 646
it's not going to get better in the second hundred years of drug prohibition. %$* 646
more to the point, i want you to think about, as you think about legalizing drugs, recognize, “is use the same as abuse? %$* 646
”, because that's the underlying kind of premise of the anti-legalization movement, to say, you know, marijuana use might go up, so what? %$* 646
if it's not bad, if it's no different than taking a beer-- %$* 646
if it's not qualitatively different than having a beer or a martini, maybe that's not such a bad thing, especially because people who are high on pot are less antisocial and less destructive and less criminal in general than people who are hopped up on a cosmo-tini or something like that. %$* 646
in the end, the legalization movement is a movement for personal responsibility where we criminalize bad behavior but not arbitrary substances. %$* 646
so please, legalize drugs. %$* 646
thank you, nick gillespie. %$* 13
legalize more drugs. %$* 646
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat. %$* 13
and i'm going to restate the motion and see where you stand now after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
our motion is, "legalize drugs." push number one if you agree with the motion, two if you disagree, and three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
anybody need more time? %$* 13
just call out. %$* 13
no? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so we'll have the results in about 45 seconds or a minute. %$* 13
first of all, i just want to-- %$* 13
i just want to thank the level of debate we heard here tonight. %$* 13
i really appreciated that these two teams respected one another, appreciated one another. %$* 13
it was forceful but friendly. %$* 13
so congratulations to them for the way they did this. %$* 13
and to all of the people who had the guts to get up and ask questions, and even the ones that didn't get through and people i didn't call on, thank you very much for participateding and a round of applause for them. %$* 13
so this is our fall season. %$* 13
we have one more event in our fall season. %$* 13
and that will be coming up on-- %$* 13
december 5th, okay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
it's december 5th. %$* 13
even in the room knew that but me. %$* 13
the upcoming debate is called the-- %$* 13
the motion is "science refutes religion." “god.” boy, you people-- %$* 13
can i sit there? %$* 13
and all of you come up here. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
science refutes god. %$* 13
and the team arguing for the motion includes lawrence krauss-- %$* 13
i'm back on script. %$* 13
lawrence kraus. %$* 13
he is professor of physics at the school of earth and space exploration at arizona state. %$* 13
his partner is michael shermer who is the founding publisher of skeptic magazine. %$* 13
and arguing against the motion that science refutes god, ian hutchinson, who is professor of nuclear science and engineering at mit. his partner is dinesh d’souza, the best selling author of "what's so great about christianity? %$* 13
" tickets for this debate are available for our website, that is www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
our next season begins in january. %$* 13
five more debates coming up. %$* 13
we start on wednesday, january 16.that will be here at kauffman. %$* 13
topics and debaters are being worked on still, but they will be posted on our website next month. %$* 13
if you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, there are a lot of other ways to catch them. %$* 13
i talked about some of them at the beginning, but you can watch the live stream on fora.tv. %$* 13
you can listen to the debates on npr, wnyc here in new york. %$* 13
you can download them as a podcast or watch them on wnet and the world digital channel. %$* 13
again, if you would like to tweet about the debate, we would love that. %$* 13
we read them all. %$* 13
the twitter handle is @iq2us, and the hash tag for this debate was drugdebate. %$* 13
all right, so here come the final results. %$* 13
all right, so remember, we've asked you to vote twice, once before the debate, and once again after the debate, where you stand on this motion before you hear the arguments and afterwards, and the team that has changed its number-- %$* 13
the team that has changed its results by the largest percentage will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so here was the motion, "legalize drugs."before the debate, 45 percent agreed with the motion, 23 percent were against, and 32 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, let's go first to the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
their second vote was 58 percent, 45 up to 58 percent. %$* 13
that is a move of 13 percent. %$* 13
that's what needs to be beaten. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote was 23 percent, the second vote was 30 percent. %$* 13
they've only gone up 7 percent. %$* 13
it is not enough. %$* 13
the team-- %$* 13
debate goes to the other side. %$* 13
our winners, the team arguing in favor of the motion, "legalize drugs." our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. where we like to say, "think twice." %$* 13

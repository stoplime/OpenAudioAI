they’ll be flexible. %$* 598
they’ll meet the quartet conditions. %$* 598
hamas, in 2006 until our conflict with them in 2008, 2009, didn’t move and still haven’t moved. %$* 598
your answer is no. %$* 13
no, no, i’m not-- %$* 13
your partner wants to bring in a point %$* 13
daniel’s response to this-- %$* 138
aaron david miller. %$* 13
question, to me, is an indication of the fundamental problem. %$* 138
it isn’t thought through, daniel. %$* 138
your response to this young woman is simply not rigorously thought through. %$* 138
you're assuming that we can create-- %$* 138
go on. %$* 597
help me with my lack of rigorous thinking aaron-- %$* 597
no, no, that is not my-- %$* 138
i’m out of that business. %$* 138
i’m not here to help you think it through cleanly, but you are dispending a proposition that will in effect set into a motion a set of consequences over which you will have absolutely no control. %$* 138
this is the fundamental problem. %$* 138
just because negotiations are stuck, and i am the first person to acknowledge just how stuck they really are-- %$* 138
doesn't mean that in an effort to maintain hope, to diffuse desperation and to accommodate some measure of urgency, we need to pursue an idea that i would argue to you-- %$* 138
and you've, in my judgment, failed to demonstrate where the real upsides are. %$* 138
the downsides of this are very, very real. %$* 138
in july 2000, we decided to recommend to bill clinton to go to camp david to try to create a conflict-ending solution between israelis and palestinians. %$* 138
do you realize that a dozen years after that summit, we are still paying for the lack of wisdom and the recklessness of that decision? %$* 138
israelis and palestinians have not yet recovered from the trauma of those ten years, because we believed in an effort to do something in the face of a desperate situation, that we could make it better. %$* 138
this notion-- %$* 138
okay. %$* 13
is reckless, and it's not well thought through. %$* 138
daniel levy to respond quickly. %$* 13
with all due respect-- %$* 597
with all due respect, aaron, to american omnipotence, i think we can allow israelis and palestinians just a little bit of agency for what happened-- %$* 597
they can have all the agency they want. %$* 138
in the last dozen years. %$* 597
and i'm sorry, aaron. %$* 597
what you have failed to demonstrate is what is the negative impacts of having two states at the un. what you've failed to-- %$* 597
what have you said? %$* 597
because you-- %$* 138
no, sorry. %$* 597
you've said this may harm obama's re-election. %$* 597
well, i don't think it's realistic-- %$* 597
no, that's not the major point. %$* 138
okay. %$* 597
let's go on then. %$* 597
you have said-- %$* 597
you have said that it might lead to more settlements. %$* 597
you know what? %$* 597
if the israeli goal is to make this territory indivisible-- %$* 597
and i hope it's not, but if that's the goal, let's start dealing with that reality. %$* 597
i don't want to go there. %$* 597
you've said it would undermine negotiations. %$* 597
negotiations have gone nowhere. %$* 597
you're the one who wrote that it was america acting as israel's lawyer that undermined that very camp david effort that you just reminded us about. %$* 597
so come on. %$* 597
give us a constructive proposal to move forward because we've explained why this helps, and you haven't explained why it doesn't. %$* 597
on the aisle here. %$* 13
could you stand-- %$* 13
could you stand, please? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
quick, yes, another question for daniel levy. %$* 18
is it fair for the israelis and the international community to expect that in return for what you support, the membership in the un, that hamas will say publicly and clearly and consistently, forevermore that they disavow violence in an arms struggle against israel. %$* 18
yes or no? %$* 18
daniel levy. %$* 13
do you want to concede to mustafa on that, or do you want to take it, or share? %$* 13
i do not think that the palestinian right to self-determination, and therefore, by extension, palestinian membership at the un should be contingent on that. %$* 597
what i do think-- %$* 597
and i made clear here tonight-- %$* 597
i do not think that. %$* 597
i don't think that israel's right to self-determination should be contingent on certain things that i believe israel should stop doing, okay? %$* 597
not that i'm drawing the %$* 597
mustafa. %$* 13
what i do think-- %$* 597
what i do think is we should use this, vis-a-vis hamas. %$* 597
and i want to make another point here, because we've spoken an awful lot about hamas. %$* 597
and anyway, as people have noticed, there's something going on in the middle east. %$* 597
the muslim brotherhood, political islam, of which hamas is a part, is kind of popular when people get the chance to vote democratically. %$* 597
this is a reality we have to deal with. %$* 597
now, we can bury our heads in the sand and say, there's a charter, and you have to stand up and publicly disavow x, y or zed, or we can work, work day in, day out, to try and create a new reality that hamas relates to, to try and create a new reality that the muslim brotherhood relates to, to work with this new reality in the middle east. %$* 597
and the more israel buries its head in the sand and says, you have to tick boxes x, y and zed before we do anything, the worst we are going to make are predicament. %$* 597
all right, mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
but on one side, we are told we would not be able to progress because palestinians are divided. %$* 596
but then the same people, israel and mr. %$* 596
gold, are against palestinian unity. %$* 596
what we are working on, what we have achieved, actually, through the most recent negotiations is that hamas officially declared, on the words of khaled meshal, that they are committing to nonviolence. %$* 596
i am trying to explain that to you, and you-- %$* 596
you don't want even to hear it, because if change is happening in the positive direction, what you see today is-- %$* 596
there is no violence in-- %$* 596
but mustafa, let me make this point. %$* 13
and-- %$* 596
no, no, but just one last point. %$* 596
if you-- %$* 596
what mr. %$* 596
miller is reporting is just specifically a continuation of the status quo. %$* 596
and we are saying this is dangerous, because today you have the whole palestinian camp ready to accept nonviolence. %$* 596
if nothing changes, if a solution is not found, if we don't move forward, then things will get worse. %$* 596
is that what we want? %$* 596
we want to find a solution. %$* 596
and when we say we are admitting-- %$* 596
we are committing to nonviolence, we are doing diplomatic resistance, israel should be happy about that, because that opens the road for a solution. %$* 596
but-- %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
just staying on the same course means-- %$* 596
okay, mustafa, i'm interrupting because you've made this point. %$* 13
but dore gold has left hanging out there several very alarming statements made by hamas. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 18
very recently that do not suggest a commitment to nonviolence. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
so i just need you-- %$* 13
i just need you to-- %$* 13
i just need you to tell us, what do we do with those statements? %$* 13
what is the %$* 13
what did you do in iraq? %$* 597
what did you do in iraq? %$* 597
what was the sunni awakening that you worked with? %$* 597
were these people who were shooting americans, did you ask them to make all kinds of pretty statements? %$* 597
you faced a tough situation. %$* 597
what are you doing now with the taliban? %$* 597
sometimes you have to mix it with unpleasant, unsavory elements. %$* 597
this isn't a lesson in how to primly have nice tea parties. %$* 597
this is a hard reality-- %$* 597
aaron david miller. %$* 13
daniel, if you-- %$* 138
if you-- %$* 138
aaron david miller. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
let him respond, and then i'll come to you. %$* 13
the fact that mr. %$* 596
zahar and others came out against meshal is proving my point, because that means that a division is happening there. %$* 596
but the official spokesperson, the leaders of this movement are admitting this. %$* 596
if this positive change is creating opposition within that organization, that is another proof that this is serious. %$* 596
okay. %$* 13
and at the end of the day, the palestinians are coming to the united nations and saying, we are committed to nonviolence as the plo and as palestinians. %$* 596
aaron david miller. %$* 13
look, in a negotiation, at least this negotiation, even if you were admitted as a member state, the logic of your analysis just isn't good enough. %$* 138
you are going to need a monopoly over the organized forces of violence in your society, even to induce the israelis or even by extension the americans. %$* 138
but isn't that what you praised in the west bank today? %$* 596
to help broker a solution on-- %$* 138
aren’t you praising the government in the west bank for having done that. %$* 596
can i finish? %$* 138
on the four core issues that drive the conflict, you will need one gun, one authority and one negotiating %$* 138
isn't that the case here? %$* 596
but you don't have that. %$* 138
and the presumption is that you should be admitted into the united nations as a full member state without it. %$* 138
but he's saying that they do-- %$* 13
that you do have it. %$* 13
in the west bank, and he is praising it. %$* 596
he is praising mr. %$* 596
fayyad on-- %$* 596
on this point, he's saying that in fact that controls in the west bank. %$* 13
isn't that the case today in the west bank? %$* 596
sadly, as a consequence of the oslo process, the area that you do control, you've actually done it as a consequence of intimate security cooperation with the israelis and assisted by the united states and the jordanians quite a lot, yes. %$* 138
so why are you unhappy? %$* 596
and you're building the institutions of statehood. %$* 138
but it's a far cry to assume that your national movement right now is unified and cohesive enough to warrant what it is you seek. %$* 138
right now-- %$* 138
and i don't mean to trivialize this. %$* 138
the palestinian national movement is literally like noah's ark. %$* 138
there are two of everything. %$* 138
there are two constitutions. %$* 138
there are two sets of security services. %$* 138
there are two polities. %$* 138
there are two independent entities-- %$* 138
at least we have a constitution. %$* 596
israel does not have a constitution. %$* 596
neither does great britain. %$* 598
on this narrow point-- %$* 138
on this narrow point-- %$* 138
daniel-- %$* 13
daniel, the noah's ark point. %$* 13
what i'm hearing is that a case has been made. %$* 597
what i'm hearing is a lot of obfuscation from the other side. %$* 597
what i'm not hearing is, how do we advance this in a different way? %$* 597
what i've not heard-- %$* 597
that's not their-- %$* 13
i know. %$* 597
i know. %$* 597
i know. %$* 597
but we're making a case. %$* 597
we're making a case for how you can begin to lay down a marker on a rapidly evaporating two-state prospect. %$* 597
and all we've heard-- %$* 597
and i thought we'd hear it. %$* 597
and even-- %$* 597
i do think there's some onus on the other side to do a little more than give us an hour and a half of nay saying. %$* 597
i'm sorry, but i really-- %$* 597
if the proposition-- %$* 138
john, can i-- %$* 138
can i respond? %$* 138
yes. %$* 13
yes, you can. %$* 13
if the proposition that iq2 us wanted to sponsor was, is israeli-palestinian peace possible, then we could have had a discussion. %$* 138
but the assertion that is made here-- %$* 138
the motion is-- %$* 138
you are asserting that palestine should be admitted as a member state. %$* 138
and it is our-- %$* 138
it was our objective-- %$* 138
we may not have succeeded to your satisfaction-- %$* 138
okay. %$* 13
perhaps even to the audience's, demonstrate why in fact that course of action-- %$* 138
what you are suggesting, mr. %$* 596
miller, is that we give israel the time to finish the settlement project. %$* 596
i'm not suggesting that at all. %$* 138
you premised a lot of your argument on-- %$* 18
who's the question for? %$* 13
mr. %$* 18
barghouthi. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
you premised a lot of your argument on claims about the balance of power between israel and the palestinians. %$* 18
the last negotiation in my mind is one in which the israelis traded one soldier for hundreds of palestinian terrorists-- %$* 18
thousand-- %$* 18
excuse me. %$* 18
and i'm wondering, given the willingness on one side-- %$* 18
on behalf of one side of the debate, namely the palestinians, to send in young boys and girls to kill themselves, how can you argue that the piece of cheese is entirely on the side of israel and that the palestinians are left with nothing to do? %$* 18
it seems like the willingness to commit suicide leaves them with a lot to do and transforms radically this balance of power which you're arguing has completely shifted to the side of the israelis. %$* 18
you are a young man. %$* 596
you are a young man. %$* 596
and i think as a young person-- %$* 596
i'm responding to your question-- %$* 596
no, i'm saying as a young person, and i admire young people, you should look into the reality today, not keep talking about the past. %$* 596
what you are describing-- %$* 596
what you are describing is something that is a long time disappeared. %$* 596
and if we keep going back to the past, we will not find a way to the future. %$* 596
you're asking why israel exchanged one prisoner for 1,000 palestinian prisoners, because palestinians had only one prisoner. %$* 596
and, by the way, by the way, by the way, there are still 5,000 palestinian prisoners in israeli jails. %$* 596
do you know how it feels-- %$* 596
do you know how it feels-- %$* 596
what is strange to me is why when the oslo agreement was signed, not all of the palestinian prisoners were released, why did it take hamas to capture an israeli soldier so that spent 33 years in jail had to be released? %$* 596
why couldn't they be released? %$* 596
because of the peace agreement. %$* 596
this is the mistake. %$* 596
one last question. %$* 13
little far from the u.n. can we keep it on the issue? %$* 18
can you come forward? %$* 13
come forward into the-- %$* 13
so the camera can see you. %$* 13
i'd like to address my question to daniel levy and dr. %$* 18
barghouthi. %$* 18
this is a question of context, gentlemen, which i don't think we've heard in this debate. %$* 18
the last legitimate democratic election in palestinian areas was won by the hamas convincingly in 2006.the palestinians, the plo, fatah as the lead faction of the plo has failed to conduct negotiations in january 2010 and subsequent. %$* 18
so the only legitimate government in the eyes of the palestinian people today is the hamas. %$* 18
on the basis of mr. %$* 18
haniya in gaza, he is the legitimate palestinian leader in the eyes of the palestinian people. %$* 18
all right-- %$* 13
so how do you argue that the israelis should be-- %$* 18
that the israeli public should be comfortable with a legitimate sovereign called the "plo" when in the eyes of the palestinians, the majority of the palestinians, it is only the hamas that was the sideline and jailed and tortured by the fatah, legitimate palestinian leadership? %$* 18
mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
let me clarify one point here. %$* 596
when hamas won election, they got 44 percent of the votes and fata got 41 percent. %$* 596
it was the stupidity of fatah, who did not accept full proportional system that led to hamas getting a majority in the parliament. %$* 596
today i assure you there is a growing number of palestinians that want to see a third alternative, which i think we represent. %$* 596
and i do not think that either hamas or fatah will get an absolute majority in any future elections. %$* 596
what you should encourage is that palestine becomes a full state democracy with pluralism. %$* 596
i always believed and i still believe that the only way to have a peaceful-- %$* 596
a lasting peace between both sides is if we have two democracies negotiating an agreement and not to have an agreement enforced from one side to another. %$* 596
all right. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are. %$* 13
we are about to give brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
those closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and after those statements, we will ask you to vote on this debate and choose the winner. %$* 13
our motion is “the u.n. should admit palestine as a full member state.” and here to summarize his position against this motion, aaron david miller, a former u.s. mideast peace negotiator, advisor to six secretaries of state, author of a book coming out in september of 2012 called, “can america have another great president? %$* 13
” aaron david miller. %$* 13
yeah, thank you very much. %$* 138
i realize that in the last 90 minutes that perhaps one of the most astute things that i’ve done, one of the best decisions i’ve made was to leave the arab-israeli negotiating process. %$* 138
and i say that with tremendous respect and affection for everybody on this panel. %$* 138
if the goal is achieving statehood, if that is really the goal, then it seems to me that u.n. admission simply doesn’t make much sense. %$* 138
you alienate the two countries that palestinians will need-- %$* 138
israel and the united states-- %$* 138
to produce meaningful and legitimate palestinian sovereignty. %$* 138
you will kill salam fayyad’s nation-state building effort. %$* 138
there’s no question about that. %$* 138
and you’re putting your hope in an international community that has never ever abandoned you, actually, but isn’t capable of delivering your sovereignty. %$* 138
and i would argue that even though, dan, you persist in saying that we haven’t demonstrated what the downsides are, i think given, in my judgment, the risks of admission and the uncertainties that will certainly follow, other than hope, which is extremely important, and diffusing a measure of desperation, even more important, you haven’t demonstrated how in effect u.n. membership will bring mustafa barghouthi and his people any closer, any closer to negotiating jerusalem borders, security, refugee into meaningful statehood. %$* 138
maybe the strategy has more to do with internal palestinian politics with mahmoud abbas’s exit strategy, with the arab spring and the arab winter, with a full reconciliation with hamas. %$* 138
in effect, if that is your objective, well then maybe you should seek u.n.admission but not if you want to facilitate the negotiations. %$* 138
my good friend, daniel levy, wrote the day before yesterday, the plo strategy-- %$* 138
the plo has a bad case of strategic combobulation. %$* 138
and the u.n-palestinian effort was a weak-- %$* 138
a damp squib, a damp squib-- %$* 138
damp squib-- %$* 138
aaron, i have to set you-- %$* 13
one more sentence, please. %$* 13
if daniel levy doesn’t believe it, which i don’t think he does, then why should-- %$* 138
no subordinate clauses. %$* 13
then why should we believe it? %$* 138
thank you, aaron david miller. %$* 13
our motion is “the u.n. should admit palestine as a full member state,” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, daniel levy, former israeli peace negotiator and senior fellow at the new america foundation. %$* 13
what i said was right. %$* 597
i think the palestinians should pursue this in a different way, and it’s going to take time, but there’s a strategy for getting there. %$* 597
we’ve spoken a lot here about hamas. %$* 597
but i think the way you further empower hamas and discourage change in hamas is to close all nonviolent diplomatic options in the face of the palestinians. %$* 597
i know people here. %$* 597
and i also don’t like to hear the word “apartheid.” here’s what the israeli minister of defense, ehud barak, said in february 2010, “the simple truth, there is one state including israel, the west bank and gaza. %$* 597
it’s either bi-national or undemocratic.” that will be an apartheid state. %$* 597
that’s the tragedy that we want to prevent. %$* 597
and you know what? %$* 597
our toolbox is an impoverished one because we have tried so much already. %$* 597
but sticking exclusively with negotiations really must be the dumbest idea. %$* 597
so what do we have left that’s nonviolent. %$* 597
let’s use the international tools of diplomacy that are at our disposal to make a statement. %$* 597
we haven’t heard negative consequences that can come from this. %$* 597
and mostly we haven’t heard what else to do except to blindly continue to place our faith in negotiations or that the palestinians somehow should only be ingratiating themselves without creating any leverage with israel and america. %$* 597
it’s been tried. %$* 597
it hasn’t worked. %$* 597
the risk is the status quo. %$* 597
the risk is the continued dissent of israeli democracy to a place where it will be unrecognizable and an inability to reach a two-state solution. %$* 597
we need to send a signal here from this room that palestine should be admitted to the un. %$* 597
and the un needs to send a signal to israelis and palestinians that there's going to be a two-state solution, otherwise the next debate will be about equal rights in one indivisible territorial unit. %$* 597
i'm not against equal rights in democracy, but i want an israel, an israel that's different, that changes. %$* 597
but i want an israel. %$* 597
and i'm sure mustafa wants a palestine. %$* 597
and we should have both of those as member states of the un. %$* 597
daniel levy, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is, "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." and here to summarize his position against the motion, dore gold, former israeli ambassador to the un and former advisor to prime minister netanyahu. %$* 13
these are-- %$* 598
this is a very important issue. %$* 598
and i am sorry that at certain points in this discussion we got heated. %$* 598
but the stakes are not just winning a debate in this very nice auditorium in nyu. this is about issues that relate to our very existence. %$* 598
i started, before i was cut off earlier on, telling you that when we withdrew from the gaza strip in 2005, we had great hopes that we were removing a cause, an irritant, and therefore, prime minister sharon, whom i knew very well, decided to take that risk and pulled out unilaterally. %$* 598
and instead of rocket fire dropping as a result, it increased between 2005 and 2006 by 500 percent. %$* 598
the state of israel is obligated to make sure that whatever arrangement we make on the west bank doesn't replicate the conditions in the gaza strip. %$* 598
unfortunately, unfortunately, mahmoud abbas has decided on a course of action that he actually began at the end of the olmert government. %$* 598
it's a course of unilateralism. %$* 598
and with this unilateralism is an effort to get recognized as a palestinian state with un membership, without having to address our concerns, without having to address the security of israel, without having to recognize my people's right to a nation state, even though i'm being asked to recognize his people's right to a nation state. %$* 598
and finally, to predetermine the outcome of negotiations by going to the un and saying, the borders will be june 4, even though the un back in '67 said we weren't going back to the exact '67 lines. %$* 598
and therefore, i suggest to you, particularly in light of the fact that we're seeing an effort to sell you an unreformed hamas, and unreformed islamic jihadist part of the palestinian political community, to reject the notion that the palestinians should be accepted as a member state until they change. %$* 598
thank you, dore gold. %$* 13
our motion is, "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, mustafa barghouthi, member of the palestinian parliament and leader of the palestinian national initiative. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 596
mr. %$* 596
gold has repeated practically what weisglass, who was an advisor to mr. %$* 596
sharon when he said that we withdraw from gaza so that we can put peace in formaldehyde. %$* 596
we can put peace to sleep. %$* 596
unfortunately, creating fear is not a solution. %$* 596
and everything that mr. %$* 596
miller and gold have suggested today is nothing but wasting time and using time. %$* 596
and i am telling them, you can maybe afford to lose time because you haven't lived for 44 years under occupation. %$* 596
you haven't lived in this position for a long time. %$* 596
and you haven't been humiliated every day by occupying forces. %$* 596
you can maybe even afford to be sarcastic, gloomy, and even depressed. %$* 596
but that will not bring change. %$* 596
yes, the peace process has become a substitute to peace, and that's why we need to change the situation. %$* 596
i cannot afford to lose time because this is about my life, about my daughter's life, and it's about the lives of the palestinians and israelis. %$* 596
and the israelis themselves cannot afford it. %$* 596
when i ask people, what do you want? %$* 596
they say we want jobs, we want education, and we want health care. %$* 596
we could not have had that-- %$* 596
we couldn't have that because we have occupation. %$* 596
and this needs to end. %$* 596
what the israelis want is also security. %$* 596
but that also cannot be available as long as palestinians are insulted and humiliated. %$* 596
where azizi in tunisia created a revolution because he brought the issue of dignity to people's minds. %$* 596
and every day, thousands of palestinians dignity is harmed. %$* 596
what we are trying to say to bring light in the end of the tunnel. %$* 596
when you vote today, don't take away hope. %$* 596
don't take away light at the end of the tunnel. %$* 596
and let me remind you here with what plato said. %$* 596
he said, “we can easily forgive children for being afraid of dark. %$* 596
the tragedy is when grown people are afraid of light." %$* 596
thank you, mustafa barghouthi, very much. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side this audience feels has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat and to push the keypad whose number corresponds to the side that you feel argued best. %$* 13
our motion is "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." if you feel this side, the side in support, argued best, push number one. %$* 13
if you feel the side against, this side argued best, push number two. %$* 13
if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and as i said before, just correct it, and you'll get the last one come in correctly. %$* 13
so i want to-- %$* 13
there is no need to apologize for bringing a little bit of heat to the conversation tonight. %$* 13
in fact, it was justified and passionate. %$* 13
but i also have a thing for light. %$* 13
and so i like to bring as much light as heat. %$* 13
and i think that ultimately this team-- %$* 13
both teams rose to that. %$* 13
and i want to thank you for hearing each other and for hearing me. %$* 13
and debating this honestly and fairly. %$* 13
and i also want to thank members of the audience who had the guts to get up and ask questions. %$* 13
and the vast majority were very good and very on point and really did move this along. %$* 13
so a round of applause to those of you who are able to get up and ask questions. %$* 13
so we'll have the vote-- %$* 13
the results of the vote in just a minute. %$* 13
what i'll do is i'll read off the preliminary numbers for, against and undecided, and then the final numbers, for, against and undecided. %$* 13
and the team with the largest difference will be declared our winner. %$* 13
in the meantime, very briefly, i want to tell you about our next debate. %$* 13
it's coming up on february 7th. %$* 13
and in light of the fact that there is a health crisis in this country of many, many varieties, but we're going to be talking about the obesity epidemic, with 33 percent of adults in this country, and 17 percent of children obese, we thought it was time to find a way to look at this issue as a matter of debate. %$* 13
and the way that we're looking at it is whether-- %$* 13
where is the issue of personal responsibility and government responsibility in this in terms of, are people obese simply because they eat too much, or are they obese because they're being advertised to because of what's in food, and additives, the proliferation of fast food. %$* 13
and does government have a role in that or not. %$* 13
basically, whose fault is it? %$* 13
and who should do something about it? %$* 13
arguing in support of the following motion: "obesity is the government's business” will be pamela peeke, also a medical doctor. %$* 13
she's a nationally renowned physician, a scientist and an expert in the fields of nutrition and fitness. %$* 13
and on web md, she is the chief lifestyle expert. %$* 13
the team arguing against this, that's saying obesity is not the government's business, is paul campos. %$* 13
he is author of "the obesity myth." he's a constitutional law professor who came to this issue in an unusual way. %$* 13
he was watching all of the coverage of the monica lewinsky story back in the late '90s, and he became obsessed with the obsession in the news media over monica lewinsky's weight. %$* 13
and he just started thinking. %$* 13
and he ended up writing some books and has strong points of view on this issue. %$* 13
and his debating partner, also arguing that it is not the government's business, but a matter of personal responsibility, john stossel, an emmy award-winning journalist. %$* 13
he is host of fox business network's stossel, a weekly program that highlights consumer issues. %$* 13
he is a contrarian. %$* 13
if you know him, who would like government to stop meddling in people's business. %$* 13
and he is himself a very, very slender television correspondent. %$* 13
and i can-- %$* 13
i can only admire him. %$* 13
so we'll take just about 30 seconds more. %$* 13
and the results will come to us. %$* 13
but thank you very much for your patience. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i've got them. %$* 13
i've just been given the results. %$* 13
remember now, we had you vote twice. %$* 13
you've heard this debate, this argument, the arguments for and against this motion, "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." we asked you to vote before and again afterwards. %$* 13
the vote afterwards telling us which side you feel presented the better argument. %$* 13
before the debate, 37 percent were in support of the motion that the u.n. should admit palestine as a full member state, 30 percent were against, and 33 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 55 percent support this motion, that is up 18 percent, 37 percent are against, that is up only seven percent, the undecideds went down by 25 percent to eight percent. %$* 13
that means the motion has carried, the side arguing the u.n.should admit palestine as a full member state has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

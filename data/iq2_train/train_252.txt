" so, i want to take that to you. %$* 13
i like the roll‐back question. %$* 13
you want-- %$* 13
if you want to take away the territory that isis has, which is its main asset, really-- %$* 13
it's what gives it the basis for claiming a caliphate, and its best advertisement for being authentic and legitimate to its adherents. %$* 13
if you're not going to take away their territory, what is it that you are going to be doing? %$* 13
take that to michèle. %$* 13
i think that it's something that-- %$* 664
it's important to understand-- %$* 664
is in order to break their narrative of victory, you have to roll‐back territory. %$* 664
you have to take territory away from isis. and the way in which we're arguing to do that is to look to the actors who do have the political will to fight, but have not been given the support or conditions. %$* 664
so, for example, this is not about trying to retrain a largely shi'a iraqi security forces to go into sunni areas. %$* 664
what we need to do is, first, with a political strategy, push the iraqi government towards a policy of inclusion of the sunnis. %$* 664
if the exclusion and the persecution of the sunni populations-- %$* 664
that has created the fertile soil for a group like isis to come in. %$* 664
they are willing to fight because it's their home territories. %$* 664
but they need two conditions. %$* 664
one is they need to know that after they fight and shed blood to kick isis out, they will be in a different iraq, that they will have some prospect for self‐governance and support, and that re‐inclusion in the iraqi society. %$* 664
and number two, they have to know that they're fully supported, that we have their back, that someone has their back. %$* 664
and here, it's not a matter of u.s., you know, brigades and divisions. %$* 664
it's a matter of giving them not only trainers on a base, but combat advisers who will help advise them when they're in contact with isis. %$* 664
all right. %$* 13
let's let anne‐marie slaughter-- %$* 13
air support-- %$* 19
anne‐marie slaughter-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
dov zakheim. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 667
a couple of things on that. %$* 667
first, we've been promising this to the sunnis for a long time in iraq. %$* 667
why should they believe us? %$* 667
number one. %$* 667
we haven't done it until now. %$* 667
and who knows if we can do it? %$* 667
dov, that's not true. %$* 665
we did it in 2007 and 2008. %$* 665
absolutely right. %$* 667
i saw it. %$* 665
you saw it. %$* 667
and where are we today? %$* 667
we walked away from it and-- %$* 667
wait-- %$* 13
the problem is-- %$* 667
wait. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
dov, you go and then-- %$* 13
this is problem is-- %$* 667
and this is our problem in the middle east-- %$* 667
you know, remember we backed the shah 1,000 percent? %$* 667
ask the shah where he is these days. %$* 667
pushing up daisies. %$* 667
the fact of the matter is we have made promise after promise. %$* 667
and let me tell you something else. %$* 667
this whole fight we have with the israelis? %$* 667
do you think the arabs look at that and say, "my god. %$* 667
they double‐crossed mubarak. %$* 667
they double‐crossed the shah. %$* 667
they're double‐ crossing the israelis. %$* 667
can we really trust them? %$* 667
" yes. %$* 667
you were right. %$* 667
what you did in '07 and '08 was absolutely right. %$* 667
what has happened since then? %$* 667
and by the way, let's look at syria. %$* 667
who did the syrians want to fight first? %$* 667
isis or assad? %$* 667
dov-- %$* 13
we-- %$* 667
dov, 15 more seconds to relate this to the motion. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 667
the point is that if you're talking about bucking up people to fight against isis, you don't have the people to buck up because we don't have the credibility to buck them up. %$* 667
does that come to the point? %$* 667
and you're saying that the roll‐back that they proposed, by using those forces, will not happen? %$* 13
can't happen. %$* 667
okay. %$* 13
i would-- %$* 666
all right. %$* 13
let me bring it to the other side, and then i'll come back to you, anne‐marie. %$* 13
philip. %$* 13
philip zelikow. %$* 13
we're not saying the status quo works. %$* 665
the resolution is not supporting the status quo. %$* 665
so that's a-- %$* 665
but what we're saying is to change the status quo you have to lead with a different political strategy. %$* 665
so, that promises the sunnis the self‐government. %$* 665
yes, many of them feel betrayed. %$* 665
they feel betrayed because the u.s.did not have their back after 2008, for various reasons. %$* 665
and so, you have to give them a situation in which they are the dominant population in syria. %$* 665
that's majority rule in syria. %$* 665
and then in iraq, therefore, a protected minority, up in the north and in the south. %$* 665
and that's doable. %$* 665
in fact, the iraqi prime minister, for the first time, with the council of ministers, has moved forward, with u.s.pressure, and the laws that would actually put in place the devolution of power down to the provinces to an unprecedented level combined with a constitution that would give those provinces the money proportionately to their population out of the iraqi budget. %$* 665
combine that with the kind of military support michèle refers to and then you have a strategy that's realistic. %$* 665
but think about the alternative. %$* 665
okay, but‐‐ %$* 13
do you give up on them and let it go? %$* 665
anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
phil, i feel like i'm back in 1965, although i was very young in 1965, but i really-- %$* 666
i feel like you're saying i'm sure we can find these folks and i'm sure they can fight our fight just as long as we give them what they need to do. %$* 666
and if they don't, well, we'll give them a little more and then we'll give them some advisors on the ground. %$* 666
and then guess what, because we really got to get this done because we really do have to roll it back, we're going to send in the troops. %$* 666
it's not as if the obama administration is not pushing as hard as it can on the iraqis to be inclusive. %$* 666
that has been our strategy. %$* 666
they're working as hard as they can. %$* 666
it's not as if they're not trying to find people in syria who will fight isil.it's not as if they haven't been pushing turkey to fight isil.everybody wants to fight isil, but they want to fight someone else more and we can't do it for them. %$* 666
tom friedman said, "any strategy in the middle east that starts with i, we, or us, is doomed to fail."it's got to be a strategy that starts with them, they lead, we stop-- %$* 666
we don't let isis expand, but they have to do the fighting and we can back them if they want to, but we're not going to roll it back. %$* 666
but the point was can they fight? %$* 665
yeah, they can fight. %$* 665
if you give them the kind of support, they've proven it. %$* 665
what they want above all is to fight to control their own homes. %$* 665
is that a realistic goal? %$* 665
yeah. %$* 665
that's a realistic goal. %$* 665
that's the goal of national liberation. %$* 665
that's not what we were fighting in vietnam-- %$* 665
i'm having difficulty understanding where you two disagree with each other. %$* 13
unless they're saying that your vision of for a long time leaving isis with the pieces of territory it has now is crazy because it's such a terrific advertisement for recruitment. %$* 13
they get their legitimacy as a caliphate from having the territory and they're saying the patience you're willing to show the situation is a crazy idea, which will lead to disintegration and ultimately an invasion. %$* 13
i’d like you to take on that point, because i think that's where i see some disagreement. %$* 13
dov zakheim. %$* 13
well, first of all we're not talking about patience here. %$* 667
i thought anne‐marie laid it out very well. %$* 667
we do want to keep pushing them. %$* 667
nobody said to stop even the bombing. %$* 667
we continue with that. %$* 667
we arm the kurds. %$* 667
we do train. %$* 667
the point is all of that is not going to defeat isis.it's going to contain isis.that's the point and it's going to take time. %$* 667
it's going to take time to recover from the fact that since 2008 when you were last there and doing what you did, we are now in 2015.seven years and by your own statement in those seven years we have not progressed. %$* 667
it takes time and you have to contain and do the things we're talking about and that you're talking about. %$* 667
i'm still convinced that the reason we sound so similar is they're making the best case for us. %$* 667
michèle flournoy. %$* 13
no we aren't. %$* 664
tell me why you're not. %$* 13
i mean, i think that-- %$* 664
because i think anne‐marie said, containment is really holding them where they are and we are saying holding them where we are is not enough, because as long as they have the territory they have they will continue to have momentum. %$* 664
they will continue to recruit. %$* 664
they will have a basis from which to launch operations and eventually there will be attacks of significance on the united states. %$* 664
the containment is a recipe for increasing risk and cost to the united states. %$* 664
so yes, the containment may be an initial phase on the way to defeat, but we have to proactively roll-- %$* 664
keep-- %$* 664
prevent them from spreading elsewhere and roll them back where they do spread. %$* 664
not by going in by ourselves, all by ourselves, but by empowering the local populations who have the political will, the legitimacy, but maybe not the means and support they need to be effective. %$* 664
and, michèle, with a u.s. brand on that effort? %$* 13
and i ask that because you're opponents are saying the minute we see-- %$* 13
i don't think we need to have a u.s.brand. %$* 664
i think the most legitimacy-- %$* 664
the people we should be supporting in the fight against isis are the sunni-- %$* 664
the vast majority of sunnis in the world who are just as appalled by them and find them just as abhorrent as we do except they're living with them. %$* 664
oh, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
that is the crux of our disagreement, right, that we're saying you hold them. %$* 666
we all agree on that. %$* 666
you're saying you can only win if you roll it back, but what you won't do is actually adopt the only strategy that would roll them back, which is massive u.s. troops, because we have been trying to get afghans and iraqis-- %$* 666
we have not adequately resourced-- %$* 664
and syrians and everyone else to fight for us and they won't do it in part because they've got other enemies, other concerns. %$* 666
we can't fight it for them, but you won't adopt the strategy that will actually get you to where you want to go. %$* 666
there are two key flaws in this argument. %$* 665
first, we have not adequately resourced or tried advise and support. %$* 665
so before you get to that argument the only thing that will work is a u.s.invasion. %$* 665
can we at least just try a proper strategy of advice and support? %$* 665
and give it a try because the second flaw in their argument is this, they assume that this is a stable equilibrium, that a devastated syria with half the population displaced and millions of people in refugee camps in all the surrounding states-- %$* 665
that can be stably maintained for who knows how long to come. %$* 665
they can just stand on that tightrope for hours and hours. %$* 665
we're saying they know they can't stay on that tightrope. %$* 665
eventually they're going to fall off that tightrope and then you ask yourself which way do you think that goes as the middle east descends into all out religious war. %$* 665
look. %$* 667
look. %$* 667
resources, $500 million bucks to train 60 people. %$* 667
that's a tremendous payout. %$* 667
because we wouldn't fight assad. %$* 665
that's why we could attract new recruits. %$* 665
okay. %$* 667
so do you want to fight assad? %$* 667
now you want to fight a two‐front war. %$* 667
syrian civil war. %$* 665
you want to fight both sides. %$* 667
that's great. %$* 667
well, i hope we figure out which side we shoot at first. %$* 667
that's how you bring the sunni coalition together. %$* 665
hang on. %$* 667
you want to put-- %$* 667
first of all, how much money should we fund the saudis whom we want to fight for us? %$* 667
i mean, the last time i checked they weren't going around with a tin cup. %$* 667
that's not what we're arguing, dov. %$* 664
so it's not the saudis. %$* 667
it's not the emirates. %$* 667
it's just these people themselves. %$* 667
again, how did the iraqi army that we were training, and we poured billions into these guys, what a great job they did. %$* 667
so they weren't fighting for their homes, you say. %$* 667
okay. %$* 667
what do you think would happen if we poured billions into the sunnis in iraq? %$* 667
do you think the central government would let us? %$* 667
they won't even let us pour money into kurdistan. %$* 667
so you really think they're going to let us pour money into the sunnis? %$* 667
and one other thing, you're making the assumption, and you've said it, the sunnis are appalled. %$* 667
i don't know that the sunnis are appalled. %$* 667
i know that english‐speaking cambridge and oxford educated sunnis are appalled. %$* 667
absolutely right. %$* 667
i will not quarrel with you, but how many people are funding these guys? %$* 667
this is just like the canadian ira-- %$* 667
okay. %$* 13
you get to the argument-- %$* 13
frankly you get to a tangle. %$* 665
it's just so hard. %$* 665
they're so mixed up. %$* 665
let's just leave them be and it'll be okay. %$* 665
we're not saying leave them be. %$* 667
and even if we we're still not saying leave them be. %$* 667
wait. %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
when this region disintegrates you don't think we will be called back in? %$* 665
do you think the day after a thousand americans are killed in a mass casualty attack that the president-- %$* 665
you're going to go to the president of the united states and just tell him doing more about it is too hard? %$* 665
i went through 9/11. i saw what happened after 9/11. saying afghanistan was the least accessible place on earth for u.s. forces, but man, it was not too hard after 9/11. %$* 665
anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 667
can i just say-- %$* 666
dov. %$* 13
dov. %$* 13
dov. %$* 13
dov. %$* 13
anne‐marie slaughter is talking now. %$* 13
all right. %$* 666
so,-- %$* 666
all right. %$* 666
i'm not going to go back to 9/11.i want to go back to the sunnis and what they want to do. %$* 666
we've heard over the past two days from professor haykel, again, somebody who spent his entire life studying islam, studying sunni islam, studying the theology. %$* 666
he estimates that roughly half of the saudis, half of the saudis, actually are sympathetic to isis. he says that the saudi government will not send its troops against isis because they are co‐tribes people and so that they are worried that the saudi military will not fight against their co‐tribes people. %$* 666
we're not asking for the saudi military to come in and fight in iraq and syria. %$* 664
well then who are we asking to fight? %$* 666
we're asking for the support to the sunnis who live in iraq, who want to be self‐ governing and to be included in the iraqi society. %$* 664
look at the number of sunni groups on the ground who are fighting isis now in syria without adequate support. %$* 664
no one's talking about bringing in the saudi arabian military or the uae. we're talking about helping the people who live on the ground in iraq and syria to reclaim their own lives and communities and— %$* 664
‐‐so the very people that the iraqi government-- %$* 666
should we just let them go? %$* 665
no, but-- %$* 667
fifty percent of the saudis now sympathize with isis.that's the product of the status quo and we should therefore say gee, this really is too hard. %$* 665
i guess saudi arabia is going to go down the tubes, too? %$* 665
where do you stop this? %$* 665
phil, you said-- %$* 666
dov zakheim was talking about-- %$* 665
the saudi government was-- %$* 666
so-- %$* 665
going to fight them. %$* 666
dov, take it. %$* 13
you're letting me talk. %$* 667
yes. %$* 13
the-- %$* 667
i've let-- %$* 13
i think there's been a fair amount of dov zakheim letting talk and going on-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 667
so-- %$* 13
thank you very much, mr. %$* 667
moderator. %$* 667
yes. %$* 13
i happened-- %$* 667
mister-- %$* 13
to be in the pentagon when they were picking up body parts in 9/11.so, i don't need to be lectured about 9/11.look. %$* 667
do you honestly think that even if we got rid of isis, we would get rid of a 9/11? %$* 667
there was no isis in 9/11.and al‐qaeda is still there. %$* 667
and there are all these franchise terrorist groups-- %$* 667
some of whom call themselves "isis," some of whom don't, who could-- %$* 667
who are just as intent on going after us. %$* 667
that is not the issue. %$* 667
to throw up the bugaboo of some individual bomber going after us, and therefore, we somehow defeat isis-- %$* 667
it just doesn't work. %$* 667
but this is where i-- %$* 664
i'm going to let michèle answer, and then-- %$* 13
i am bothered by-- %$* 664
i'm going to go to-- %$* 13
michèle, can you hang on just one second? %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 664
i'm going to let you answer. %$* 13
i just want to go to questions from you after that. %$* 13
and when that comes, the lights will come up. %$* 13
the way it will work-- %$* 13
just raise your hand. %$* 13
stand up. %$* 13
a mic will be brought to you. %$* 13
please wait for the mic before asking your question. %$* 13
go ahead, michèle flournoy. %$* 13
you know, you're right in the sense that there will always be violent extremists of one sort or another. %$* 664
what we need to focus on is trying to address the conditions that make whole communities vulnerable to being with them. %$* 664
and there, we have an approach that has not been tried and has not been fully resourced to do that in iraq. %$* 664
and i think that's a much harder problem in syria. %$* 664
but there are things that we have not tried that can also do that in syria. %$* 664
and so, i think getting wrapped around the axle about how much military intervention are we talking about is a very important question. %$* 664
but the fundamental issue is what can and should we do to address those fundamental conditions, because if we don't address them, this threat will reach out and touch america. %$* 664
but do you really disagree with that statement? %$* 13
no. %$* 666
i mean, no-- %$* 666
there is-- %$* 666
i don't think there's anyone in this entire audience who has fought as hard as i have, over the past three years, to try to use force to bring the civil war in syria to a political conclusion. %$* 666
so, we are-- %$* 666
you know, if it's a question of what do we do to end the civil war in syria, i've got a whole another strategy. %$* 666
but what we're talking about here-- %$* 666
of course we're with you in terms of pushing the iraqi government to be more inclusive. %$* 666
we're with you diplomatically. %$* 666
we're with you again on the digital strategy, which is a huge piece of isis. what we're saying, though, is-- %$* 666
what you're saying is we have to push them out of the territory they hold. %$* 666
and we are saying there is no way to actually do that that does not actually involve massive u.s.troops on the ground, and that we can talk about supporting others. %$* 666
we've been trying that for a long time. %$* 666
that's not going to get us there. %$* 666
did your syria-- %$* 665
did your strategy to intervene aggressively-- %$* 665
philip zelikow. %$* 13
to end the syrian civil war require lots of u.s. troops on the ground? %$* 665
no. %$* 666
it did not. %$* 666
it required-- %$* 666
so, you ought to just come on over here now. %$* 665
no. %$* 666
nope. %$* 666
nope. %$* 666
but we'll-- %$* 666
that's a separate debate. %$* 666
let's go to questions. %$* 13
right down in front here. %$* 13
please stand up and let the mic come to you. %$* 13
and if you could tell us your name as well. %$* 13
it's coming from-- %$* 13
it's coming down the aisle, behind you, to the right. %$* 13
this is peter feaver. %$* 668
and i have a question for the nattering nabobs, the negativism, over here on this side. %$* 668
you've invoked the example of containment. %$* 668
but the only example of it working in history that you've mentioned is against a superpower, the soviet union. %$* 668
can you tell me a time when containment of a terrorist organization worked? %$* 668
and if you're willing to do the soviet union containment model, are you willing to continue with, leader‐to‐ leader, summits between the-- %$* 668
baghdadi and maybe even ping‐pong diplomacy with-- %$* 668
how far down the containment-- %$* 668
okay. %$* 13
a‐la soviet union are you willing to go? %$* 668
thanks. %$* 13
good question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 666
sure. %$* 666
anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
so, you just-- %$* 666
you thought we were containing a superpower. %$* 666
we were not. %$* 666
we were containing an ideology. %$* 666
and what is vital about understanding isil is it's just the latest manifestation of an extremist ideology that says, "the only way to purify islam," just as once there were arguments about the only way to purify christianity, "is to revert to an extreme version of the religion." so, the beginning round of this is 1979, with the attack on the great mosque in mecca. %$* 666
and similarly, actually, the iranian revolution. %$* 666
then you see the taliban. %$* 666
then you see al‐qaeda. %$* 666
then, as you've heard, you see boko haram. %$* 666
you see manifestations of what is a decades‐long fight. %$* 666
the arab spring is another version of it, that says, "this religion is deeply, deeply corrupt. %$* 666
it is impossible to have a decent government. %$* 666
we want to purify the religion and we want decent governments. %$* 666
and it's just going to keep happening until muslims fight it out. %$* 666
and our argument is we can contain it. %$* 666
we obviously have to protect ourselves. %$* 666
but we are not going to be the ones to actually win this fight. %$* 666
i want to let the other side respond to the initial question, if you would like to. %$* 13
michèle flournoy. %$* 13
i think the-- %$* 664
you know, the reason why-- %$* 664
one of the reasons why containment works, vis‐a‐vis a superpower in a state like the soviet union, was because it was coupled with a robust policy of deterrence and the threat of massive retaliation. %$* 664
these concepts are not operative when you're dealing with isis. what are we going to do to deter-- %$* 664
i mean, isis-- %$* 664
deterrence of the cold war sort does not operate when-- %$* 664
sure it does. %$* 666
you're dealing with a transnational terrorist organization. %$* 664
what's an example of what's worked with a terror organization? %$* 665
quite the contrary. %$* 666
the example is, as we've also heard from the experts on isil, is that isil thinks that al‐qaeda's strategy was a failed strategy because they caused a catastrophic attack and precisely because we then went in and wiped them out. %$* 666
and their strategy is not to do that. %$* 666
so, we of course are still going to protect ourselves. %$* 666
if there is such an attack, we are going to respond. %$* 666
and then the american people will support sending in troops. %$* 666
and we will do what we have to. %$* 666
but our point is that is not their strategy. %$* 666
their strategy is to hold territory. %$* 666
we're going to contain them there and ultimately let the muslims fight it out. %$* 666
you know, it's interesting-- %$* 665
philip zelikow. %$* 13
when someone said today that, "maybe we didn't need to worry so much about a catastrophic threat," it turned out that the recently retired head of the british secret service was at the table. %$* 665
and he said, "when i was listening to you say that, i was thinking that neither i nor any leader of any security service i know of would have understood what you are talking about." if the-- %$* 665
the threat picture that they are seeing, the threat picture that caused the director of the fbi to publicly say two weeks ago that isis is now the leading threat on his agenda, the reason the fbi has been picking up isis supporters in all 50 states of the united states during the last month-- %$* 665
that's because of the threat picture that they are seeing. %$* 665
and that's this year. %$* 665
that's not 2016. that's 2017. you just think about the way this develops in time, because this is a much larger safe haven than al‐qaeda ever had. %$* 665
a question down front here. %$* 13
and the mic is coming down this way. %$* 13
my name is ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 19
and michèle and philip, you made a fantastic moral case to defeat isis.and i completely agree with you. %$* 19
last year this time, september, our president stood in front of the world and said, "we're going to degrade and defeat isis." our vice president told the world, "we're going to chase them to the gates of hell."you made a fantastic case. %$* 19
and i'm with you. %$* 19
i voted for it and i think i'll vote for it again. %$* 19
i need you to-- %$* 13
but there's a question-- %$* 19
i-- %$* 13
here's a question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
and here's the question. %$* 19
and the question that you have to answer and you have to deal is really, is this debate about isis or is it about american leadership? %$* 19
is the united states of america prepared to take the lead in this? %$* 19
and for the two of you, what case would you make to the presidential candidates and to the american people to take that lead and keep that lead? %$* 19
i think the – %$* 664
michèle flournoy. %$* 13
this is about both. %$* 664
i think we have to make the case that isis is a threat that will directly, touch-- %$* 664
threaten americans, whether we want that to be true or not, and that the kind of political strategy, the kind of coalition, the kind of effort that is going to be needed to actually turn the president's and the vice president's words into actions-- %$* 664
which has not fully happened yet-- %$* 664
that will require u.s. leadership. %$* 664
and nobody else but the united states can lead that coalition to beat this organization. %$* 664
okay. %$* 13
the other side does not need to respond. %$* 13
right down in front there, sir. %$* 13
and the mic is going to come down-- %$* 13
you see. %$* 13
great debate. %$* 283
graham allison. %$* 283
if this is such an imminent threat, why is it that our israeli allies are so relaxed about it? %$* 283
we have a track two conversation‐‐ %$* 283
you actually did ask a question. %$* 13
that was perfect. %$* 13
so i'm going to go with that-- %$* 13
because i think these people know the background on it. %$* 13
so i'll take it to anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
so, i would ask exactly the same question. %$* 666
i mean, israel's our closest ally in the middle east. %$* 666
they are certainly every bit as much enemies of isis as we are. %$* 666
as i said, isis fights the crusaders, the zionists, the sufis and the shiites and, yes, israel looks at this, i think, and understands that to get in there to the extent that it would take to roll them back from their territory is immediately to strengthen them, because then they're fighting the zionist enemy and so i-- %$* 666
i think israel is very wise on this. %$* 666
response from this side? %$* 13
phil zelikow. %$* 13
the presumption that israel is relaxed about isis-- %$* 665
which would-- %$* 665
you know, any member of isis if he were to encounter an israeli citizen in isis territory, there's going to be a really gruesome video the next week, okay? %$* 665
so the notion that‐‐put yourself in israel's position. %$* 665
they have a lot of things going on in their world right now. %$* 665
palestinians. %$* 665
they're attacking hezbollah in syria, which is also fighting on assad's side. %$* 665
so, the notion that gee, let's see if we can attack and bomb isis so that jewish airplanes are bombing isis and that helps us recruit sunni muslims? %$* 665
so i think the israeli's have kind of figured out that that's not the path to a successful coalition strategy to defeat isis. %$* 665
hang on just one second. %$* 13
i'm going to let you respond. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
somebody needed i thought to tell me something. %$* 13
they want me to point to her. %$* 13
anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
maybe the other reason the israeli's are not quite so upset is that isis is actually attacking both hezbollah and hamas. %$* 666
let's go to another question. %$* 13
down front here. %$* 13
sir, if you could stand up. %$* 13
the mic's coming. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
stefan edlis short statement. %$* 18
very short, please. %$* 13
very short. %$* 18
when the irish-- %$* 18
excuse the expression, not irish, but the arab spring. %$* 18
i want to know the free association that got you there. %$* 13
they were secular. %$* 18
it turns out to be they're actually a religious revival. %$* 18
so, a religious revival. %$* 18
my question is very simple directed to you. %$* 18
where would the money come from to undertake that gigantic effort that you propose? %$* 18
well, as i said, i don't think-- %$* 667
dov zakheim. %$* 13
i don’t think that right now we have the national will to do this and frankly even if we started spending the money and, you know, we do spend money on these sorts of things, this takes time. %$* 667
in effect what you're doing when you-- %$* 667
if we were to do what you suggest, we would be containing them. %$* 667
we wouldn't be rolling them back at that point. %$* 667
they wouldn't lose an inch of territory because of that. %$* 667
it takes time. %$* 667

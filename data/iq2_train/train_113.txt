can i just say this-- %$* 347
all right, but very quickly. %$* 13
i think this is a part of the false premise of the other side. %$* 347
we have never taken the position nor does the resolution require us to take the position that in the give and take of a legislative process or a negotiation between a governor and legislature that you compromise. %$* 347
you don't get off that easy. %$* 347
that's not what this resolution says. %$* 347
what this resolution says is that the republican party should cease to be the party of unalloyed, authentic, unapologetic conservatism and should instead try to split the difference between where it is and where the democrats are. %$* 347
let me just let you in on a little secret, a, that won't work politically; and, b, it ain't happening. %$* 347
ralph, we-- %$* 13
it's not going to happen. %$* 347
ralph-- %$* 13
the democrats are on the left. %$* 347
the republicans are on the right. %$* 347
and there are lots of reasons for that that we could get into. %$* 347
ralph, i feel we now need from you, if you can do it in 18 seconds, talking about defining your terms, defining "conservatism." what are the tenets? %$* 13
what are the pieces of it? %$* 13
because i think that's where a lot of this disagreement is coming. %$* 13
well, i think conservatism in a nutshell is a philosophy that argues that as government gets bigger, that freedom necessarily constricts. %$* 347
and we believe people are best able to rise as high and as far as their god-given talents, abilities, ambitions, and desires will carry them when government gets out of the way and allows free men and women to do those things that are best left to them. %$* 347
government should be small. %$* 347
it should be limited, and it should be confined to specific enumerated purposes. %$* 347
where do the social issues fit in? %$* 13
well, i'm happy-- %$* 347
wait a minute. %$* 13
i am not trying to zing at all. %$* 13
media-- %$* 346
well, i'll chime in here. %$* 346
laura ingraham. %$* 13
it's the idea of ordered liberty. %$* 346
jefferson wrote about it. %$* 346
madison, mickey's favorite framer, wrote about it, that liberty without virtue is really meaningless because my idea of liberty could conflict with your personal space or everyone does what everyone wants to do in his or her own time, and obviously you'll have natural conflicts. %$* 346
so ordered liberty is obviously the best. %$* 346
and a moral core, encouraging moral behavior, society changes, maybe society will change what the meaning of the world "moral" is, and i understand that. %$* 346
but the morality has a place. %$* 346
we see it playing out today with the reaction to what happened in the horrible attack in boston. %$* 346
morality is around us. %$* 346
we can try to ignore it, we can try to say that-- %$* 346
okay. %$* 13
government has no role in it. %$* 346
but reality actually matters. %$* 346
by the way, it fits in in the same place that the civil rights act of 1964 fits in, okay? %$* 347
i'm not allowed to deny you the right to sit at a lunch counter simply because of the color of your skin. %$* 347
and we believe that if you take, for example, the issue of abortion, that an unborn child is a person for purposes of the 14th amendment of the constitution; therefore, to take their life without due process, as we're seeing unfold in this gruesome trial in pennsylvania, with this doctor who systemically executed children who could perform outside the womb, violated their god-given right, and by the way, their constitutional right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. %$* 347
all right. %$* 13
let me bring it back to the other side. %$* 13
mickey edwards, you want to respond to the-- %$* 13
as we move into the part of conservatism being involved with socialism. %$* 13
yeah, i have some thoughts here, but i kind of got stunned here by this definition of liberty. %$* 345
so in the case of the civil rights and you cannot deny african-americans, obviously you shouldn't, these rights, you know, that's a good thing. %$* 345
but denying gays rights, that's different, right? %$* 345
so, i mean, there’s a point where you're not being consistent, are you for liberty, or are you for restrictions on liberty? %$* 345
are you for a workable government, or are you against it? %$* 345
are you for limited government or not? %$* 345
i mean, you're on every side of everything. %$* 345
that doesn't work. %$* 345
can i respond to that? %$* 347
i'd like to go-- %$* 13
i'm going to give one note to the audience, then you can respond. %$* 13
i want to now go to, for questions after ralph responds to that. %$* 13
and how it works is if you raise your hand, a mic will be brought to you down the aisle. %$* 13
just please wait till the mic reaches you. %$* 13
if i call on you, please stand up so that we can see you with the camera. %$* 13
tell us your name, and pop out a question, you know, a really focused question that's on this-- %$* 13
on this topic. %$* 13
we're-- %$* 13
we know that a lot of people have passions on this on one side or the other. %$* 13
we don't really-- %$* 13
really not really looking for you to tell us how you feel about one side or the other. %$* 13
we believe you do. %$* 13
we really want you to throw something into the mix that gets these guys talking to each other. %$* 13
and i will pass on questions, respectfully, that don't meet that standard. %$* 13
ralph, go ahead. %$* 13
well, i would say, first of all, gays and lesbians have not experienced the same level of jim crow-like invidious historic discrimination that african-americans did. %$* 347
they've not-- %$* 347
wait a minute. %$* 347
they've not been denied the right to vote. %$* 347
they've not been prevented to run for political office. %$* 347
if you believe that gays and lesbians were subjected to slavery and segregation and denied the right to vote for over 100 years after the 13th amendment granted them the right to vote, that has never happened in american history. %$* 347
so they are free in a free society to make moral choices with which i may disagree. %$* 347
just by the way straights are. %$* 347
there are straight men and women who live together outside of wedlock, do so every day, and they're free to do so in a free society. %$* 347
i'm not going in there to try to interfere with their personal decision. %$* 347
the issue before the country is whether or not that relationship should be defined as the institution of marriage. %$* 347
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
right down in the front. %$* 13
and i want you to wait for the microphone. %$* 13
it's coming from your right-hand side, just being passed down. %$* 13
if you could stand up and tell us your name. %$* 13
and also, you need to hold the microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
that's all you have to remember. %$* 13
bella cohen. %$* 348
my question is really for mrs. %$* 348
ingraham. %$* 348
i'm not married, but i'm glad-- %$* 346
is there a husband out there-- %$* 346
oh, great. %$* 346
sorry. %$* 348
"ms." is fine. %$* 346
i'm bought into that now. %$* 346
oh, so-- %$* 348
yeah, i've evolved. %$* 346
things have changed. %$* 348
i'm centrist, david. %$* 346
centrist, yeah, like bush. %$* 344
what can i say? %$* 346
so now it's all four on one side. %$* 347
and you didn't die. %$* 13
i'm a little too old for the "miss" at this point, so go ahead. %$* 346
my question is, why has the republican party failed-- %$* 348
what do you see as the failure-- %$* 348
because you have to admit there have been many, many failures in the last %$* 348
so how do you define what the failures-- %$* 348
i was-- %$* 348
by the way, that was a really great model for a question. %$* 13
do that, and it's going to work. %$* 13
well, done. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i was a-- %$* 346
very briefly, i was a kid growing up in connecticut. %$* 346
my mom was a waitress. %$* 346
i had a middle class lifestyle. %$* 346
i kind of gravitated toward reagan. %$* 346
i didn't really have any reason to be political. %$* 346
but this guy was kind of an older guy, but he seemed to love america, and he thought government was kind of out of control. %$* 346
i saw my parents in these gas lines, and interest rates are really high. %$* 346
parents couldn't make much more money. %$* 346
listened to him and thought that message made sense. %$* 346
the reagan experience was not without its pitfalls. %$* 346
reagan did compromise on some issues. %$* 346
but that vision of conservatism, which was a happy warrior conservatism, which was unyielding in the face of the soviet threat, which understood that the power of the individual, individual prosperity, was best achieved with a government that didn't get in the way. %$* 346
those messages were clearly stated, mostly optimistically stated. %$* 346
but he could throw the punches when necessary. %$* 346
reagan was a great example for me as a young person. %$* 346
i think as time went on, they had some successes obviously in the '90s. %$* 346
republicans took the house of representatives for the first time in 50 years in 1994.seemed like we were back on track. %$* 346
and george bush-- %$* 346
i mean, i sound like i'm beating up on george bush, but george bush comes along, i like him very much. %$* 346
we had an idea that republicanism-- %$* 346
laura, i-- %$* 13
needed to expanded. %$* 346
laura, just in terms of-- %$* 13
the republican party turned its back on core conservative principles. %$* 346
conservatism was never about remaking the world in its image. %$* 346
conservatism was not about starting wars that we didn't have clear exit paths with. %$* 346
and it wasn't about running up big deficits. %$* 346
conservatism became that sadly during the bush years. %$* 346
and it nearly destroyed the republican party. %$* 346
it wasn't the tea party in 2010. it was bush from 2004 to 2008. %$* 346
does the other side want to respond to that? %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
i just want to respond to the reagan revisionism which i knew would come up. %$* 344
it took a lot longer than i thought. %$* 344
so reagan raised taxes 14 times. %$* 344
he included the biggest tax hike in american history to that point. %$* 344
reagan signed the therapeutic abortion act, which was one of the bigger liberalizations of abortion laws. %$* 344
that didn't make him a moderate. %$* 344
it made him someone who was practical politician. %$* 344
and he fought for what he could and tried to get things done, but he was willing to address real problems and not govern on the basis of a prefab ideology. %$* 344
was he a centrist? %$* 346
no. %$* 344
but he was someone who was willing to govern. %$* 344
he took on the republican orthodoxy which was made up of centrists. %$* 346
from 1976 onward and years before that, he debated everybody from rfk to republican-- %$* 346
rockefeller republicans, many of whom would probably agree with a lot of the points you're making and you're making well. %$* 346
it sounds like where you're disagreeing on reagan is a question of substance and style. %$* 13
right. %$* 344
so, well, maybe two ways. %$* 344
ronald reagan adjusted to the problems of his day. %$* 344
in the late 1970s, there was a stagflation. %$* 344
there was a global shift of overregulation. %$* 344
there was a global shift of government which really did stagnate the country. %$* 344
and ronald reagan, i think, responded very intelligently, along with margaret thatcher, to the problems of those days. %$* 344
the problem is the problem of 2013, it's not 1980, and the problems are different. %$* 344
and if you stay with some mythical, pure reaganism, which includes no tax increases ever, small government all the way, which is mythical, then you are not responding to the problems of today. %$* 344
where are the centrists winning, and where are there centrists making a difference in government today? %$* 346
what centrist republican has won and changed the face of the republican party? %$* 346
where? %$* 346
where is it happening? %$* 346
it didn't happen in california. %$* 346
okay. %$* 13
i want him to answer the question because, i mean, that's a great question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 344
well, we're sitting in new york city. %$* 344
at the bloomberg? %$* 346
we just had a couple of mayors of new york city who were, i would say, moderate republicans, probably pretty good for new york. %$* 344
i'd say governor chris christie would be good for new jersey. %$* 344
he won with the tea party, david. %$* 346
i would say outside the washington, d.c. and some of the red states, it's impossible to become a centrist because-- %$* 344
let me go to another question. %$* 13
they're not winning. %$* 346
that's the whole point. %$* 346
let me go to another question. %$* 13
can i-- %$* 347
can i quickly-- %$* 347
there down in the front. %$* 13
respond to what dave said before we go to the question? %$* 347
i want to move on if you don't mind. %$* 13
okay. %$* 347
all right. %$* 347
and you can save a little bit for your-- %$* 13
right. %$* 347
closing remarks. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
jamal thomas. %$* 349
i thought david started out everything excellent when he talked about the little girl. %$* 349
and i haven't heard a lot from the other side. %$* 349
and i think the center would love to hear-- %$* 349
when there's a parent who is on drugs and various different things of that effect that can't take care of the child, who's responsible for that? %$* 349
and again, i think the-- %$* 349
wait, can you frame your question more towards-- %$* 13
to something that feeds into our motion? %$* 13
rather than saying, who's responsible for the vulnerable? %$* 13
well-- %$* 349
in terms of what are you saying that's-- %$* 13
what is-- %$* 13
how does that question relate to the republican party that you see today? %$* 13
well, i mean, i'm somebody who would consider myself a moderate. %$* 349
i look at the right, i look at the left, but i can't completely move in that right direction because i don't feel the level of compassion for that little girl that david spoke to. %$* 349
and i-- %$* 349
all right. %$* 13
can i-- %$* 13
i didn't hear the other side-- %$* 349
rephrase your question to-- %$* 13
of course. %$* 349
and i think-- %$* 13
it seems to me as to this side-- %$* 13
and i may be wrong-- %$* 13
can i rephrase your question to ask this side, is does the party have a reputation for not connecting to the-- %$* 13
to the problems of-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 346
yeah. %$* 347
ordinary people? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 346
yeah. %$* 349
can i just-- %$* 349
i want to make sure that i'm clear about it. %$* 349
it-- %$* 349
when their parents cannot take care of them, who is, then, responsible? %$* 349
well, that's a different question from our debate. %$* 13
if i can respond-- %$* 347
the party does have that reputation. %$* 347
it is an undeserved reputation, but it nonetheless is the case. %$* 347
but the fact of the matter is that what the republican party stands for, what it fights for and what it seeks to advance, is policies that will strengthen marriage, family, childbearing and rearing, so that young people are not left behind in circumstances where this young girl could end up finding herself. %$* 347
we seek policies that strengthen the family, because we know that if somebody gets married and stays married, bears children within the institution of marriage, and gets a job, any job, and graduates from high school-- %$* 347
that person that i just described, in the united states of america, you know what that-- %$* 347
what chance that person has of living in poverty? %$* 347
two percent. %$* 347
you do the opposite of those four behaviors, you don't graduate from high school, you don't get your first job, you bear children outside the institution of marriage, you have an 85 percent chance of living in poverty. %$* 347
and i read “losing ground.” and charles murray's exactly right. %$* 347
but the sociology and pathology of poverty in america today is largely as a result of government policies that don't strengthen those institutions. %$* 347
can i just ask for detail? %$* 344
you mentioned you support-- %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
policies that support child-rearing. %$* 344
what exactly are those policies? %$* 344
well, i can give you a number of examples. %$* 347
number one, school choice, which we know dramatically increases parental involvement in a child's education, david. %$* 347
all the social science shows that if a parent can choose the school, that they're going to be more involved in that child's education. %$* 347
secondly, we supported the $500 per child tax credit, which became $1,000 per child tax credit, which we made fully refundable. %$* 347
david, that is the most successful anti-poverty program in the last 30 years. %$* 347
it lifted 9 million people out of poverty last year. %$* 347
that was in the contract with america. %$* 347
ralph-- %$* 13
so, the idea-- %$* 347
ralph, can i just ask you-- %$* 13
ralph-- %$* 13
can i-- %$* 347
let me give you one more. %$* 347
let me give you one more-- %$* 347
are those policies-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
with respect to this debate. %$* 13
are those policies non- centrist? %$* 13
i've been trying to give an example-- %$* 347
are those policies that you just listed non-centrist? %$* 13
what? %$* 347
do those policies belong to the conservative party or-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 347
they're non-- %$* 13
no, they're non-centrist? %$* 13
i agree with him. %$* 18
if you think that-- %$* 347
i will tell you this. %$* 347
i mean, bill clinton vetoed our budget with the child tax credit in it two times. %$* 347
do you think welfare reform was a moderate idea? %$* 347
we helped move 2 million people from welfare to work in the 1990s. %$* 347
and people said they would end up homeless. %$* 347
these are conservative ideas-- %$* 347
it's not-- %$* 346
the-- %$* 346
that lift people out of poverty-- %$* 347
and washington-- %$* 346
and give them hope. %$* 347
and instead of their hope being in government dependency, it allows them to move to dignity and self-reliance, work, stronger marriages, and families. %$* 347
and that's what's going to lift people out of party, not government programs out of washington, d.c. %$* 347
all right. %$* 13
let me go to another question. %$* 13
sir, right in the middle. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
and if you can stand and tell us your name when the mic reaches you? %$* 13
i need the mic to reach you. %$* 13
it's coming on your right-hand side. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
the question, for those are in favor of this proposal, is if immigration, in the future, for whatever reason, wasn't an issue, could these conservative values that are quite far right capture the hispanic vote, which is very religious and which might be more prone to support this position? %$* 18
so i agree it's-- %$* 18
all right, great question. %$* 13
let's put that to mickey edwards. %$* 13
you know, i-- %$* 345
first of all, yes, but here's-- %$* 345
i mean, i agree with a lot of what ralph said about the positions that he was advocating. %$* 345
you know, those are conservative. %$* 345
but i-- %$* 345
we used to call-- %$* 345
people used to call the republican party the "dumb party," and i tried to think, "why is that? %$* 345
why is it the dumb party? %$* 345
" so what happens when you have good ideas like the ones you just talked about, and you have the president of the other party and the senate of the other party, and you want to advance toward what you say, but if they say, "okay, let's find a compromise," you say, "no," and, therefore, you get nothing, instead of moving in the direction you're advocating, you get nothing. %$* 345
that's dumb. %$* 345
that's really dumb, and that's the reputation the republican party is getting. %$* 345
laura ingraham. %$* 13
well, on the issue of compromise, barack obama brooks no compromise on certain issues. %$* 346
number one, on d.c.opportunity scholarships, i don't know if you guys know what that is, but that was a school choice initiative, wildly popular in my hometown of the district of columbia. %$* 346
african-americans, latinos line up around blocks to get their kids enrolled in the d.c.opportunity scholarship. %$* 346
the centrist, barack obama, zeroed out-- %$* 346
approved the zeroing out of the money, pittance, i think it was $13 million, a drop in the bucket in our budget, for those families. %$* 346
okay, so the idea that somehow that's compromise or that's-- %$* 346
there's all sorts of compromise going on, on the other side, not when it brooks the teacher's union, not when they're up against their people, so republicans need to compromise and move to the center, but democrats on issues like the unions and opportunity scholarships, there's no way they're going to do that. %$* 346
and on the point about the-- %$* 346
about the african-american point, i think it's an important one, i'd just like to say one brief thing, you're absolutely right. %$* 346
republicans have been abysmal, from romney, to mccain, and to pretty much everybody in between, about talking to people as people. %$* 346
they have different views. %$* 346
they have different values. %$* 346
that's okay. %$* 346
rand paul, tea party, not centrist republican, is the first republican to actually really go speak to african-americans in a meaningful way. %$* 346
he did that last week at howard university. %$* 346
he was booed for having done so, but i give him great credit for doing that. %$* 346
he began the conversation. %$* 346
i hope it continues, but you're making an absolutely important and valid point, and we have been terrible at that. %$* 346
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, and i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, debating this motion, "the gop must seize the center or die." sir, you're waving so vigorously, it makes me nervous. %$* 13
for the microphone to come on up and please don't make me regret this. %$* 13
my name is robert rosenthal. %$* 1
the low point of the campaign last year for presidency was during the republican primaries when the candidates were asked if they would lower the deficit by 10-part spending cuts to one-part tax raising, and everyone said they wouldn't do that. %$* 1
my question to this side is do you see that as an admirable stand for their principles or as an indication that they just can't govern the country? %$* 1
i owe you an apology. %$* 13
that's a pretty darn well-worded question. %$* 13
well, the-- %$* 347
ralph reed. %$* 13
the short answer is, "neither," because there're two rules in american politics. %$* 347
the first is you can be asked any question that the questioner wants to ask you. %$* 347
the second is you can answer it any way you want. %$* 347
and our candidates just didn’t seem to fully grasp that second rule. %$* 347
they were given a choice of raise your hand. %$* 347
what they should have said was-- %$* 347
and i can't remember who the moderator was, you know, doesn't matter-- %$* 347
but you should say, "that offer will never come. %$* 347
there has never been a time in modern american political history where a republican president has been offered a deal of a dollar in tax revenue-- %$* 347
new tax revenue for $10 in spending cuts, and it never will happen.” and, by the way, you know, david was talking about the tax increase that reagan signed in 1982, which was then the largest tax increase in american history. %$* 347
i was there. %$* 347
i was working in the u.s.senate at the time. %$* 347
it was supposed to be $3 in spending cuts for every dollar in tax increases. %$* 347
reagan signed it. %$* 347
all the taxes went up. %$* 347
the spending never got cut. %$* 347
he never got the spending. %$* 347
he went on to say it was one of the biggest mistakes he made as president. %$* 347
and that's why. %$* 347
if you look at what obama's proposed, it's basically dollar for dollar. %$* 347
now at a time when we're spending a trillion dollars a year that we don't have, republicans are not going to agree to that kind of ratio. %$* 347
well, mickey had asked for permission to speak next. %$* 13
and i'll come to you, david, and i'll leave you guys-- %$* 13
i just wanted to respond to the point in the gentleman's question. %$* 345
what shows you where the republican party is, it is-- %$* 345
you mentioned the primaries. %$* 345
it's the primary system where the republican activist, the true believers, people like you show up. %$* 345
and what happens is you end up with nominees like christine o'donnell and sharon engel and richard murdoch and denny rehberg. %$* 345
that's what has to come out of a republican primary, and that's what's killing the party. %$* 345
it's not some magical moderate or not moderate. %$* 345
it's that the republican party continues to put, on the ballot as its champions saying, “this is what we believe,” people who are so far out of the acceptable mainstream that people just can't accept it. %$* 345
and your partner david brooks wants to add something. %$* 13
you know, ralph's a good consultant. %$* 344
if he had consulted-- %$* 344
if they had asked him before they raised the hand question, he would have given that good advice of how to dodge it. %$* 344
but they didn't just dodge that. %$* 344
they didn't just answer that question. %$* 344
they raised their hand, and then they defended it for the rest of the campaign. %$* 344
they defended the position that $10 in spending was not worth $1 in tax increases. %$* 344
they support that. %$* 344
they believe in that, they talked about it. %$* 344
it was a perfect example of the sort of absolutist position; a position of preference that a lot of us have that taxes shouldn't go up turned into an absolute fetish. %$* 344
and as a result, this party is incapable of reaching a budget deal. %$* 344
now, i don't support all the budget deals that were out there, but a couple years ago, they were given a budget deal of $3 to one, $3 of spending cuts to $1 of tax increase. %$* 344
that, to me, was the no-brainer of the century. %$* 344
take that deal. %$* 344
they didn't take the deal. %$* 344
they lost the election. %$* 344
now we're down to maybe one to one. %$* 344
this is a party that's incapable of getting to yes. %$* 344
the centrist president-- %$* 346
laura ingraham. %$* 13
barack obama has produced two budgets, i guess, right? %$* 346
is that right, two budgets in five years. %$* 346
the last one late. %$* 346
i think it's the first time a president delivered a budget that late in modern history, or maybe ever. %$* 346
and the president's first budget got a total of zero votes for his budget, which apparently would be filled with compromise and moving to the middle and understanding governance and all of that. %$* 346
got no support. %$* 346
and it doesn't look like his current budget is getting any support either. %$* 346
so the idea that the republicans are sitting there as this-- %$* 346
as this buoy in the water, and it will not tact to one direction or the other. %$* 346
it's ridiculous. %$* 346
the republicans have tons of problems, believe me. %$* 346
but the idea that if they-- %$* 346
again, the proposition on the table, they have to move to the center or die. %$* 346
they are alive and well in blue state wisconsin. %$* 346
they are alive and well in blue state new mexico where representative steve pierce, republican, anti-immigration reform, just won 41 percent of the hispanic vote in southern new mexico by actually, as our-- %$* 346
mickey edwards. %$* 13
questioner said, talking to the people there, including latino voters. %$* 346
let me ring in mickey edwards. %$* 13
i wasn't going to make a point. %$* 345
i was going to ask a question of laura, whether or not the centrist obama you referred to was the same one you referred to in your opening states as the most liberal president ever. %$* 345
no. %$* 346

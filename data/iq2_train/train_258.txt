and i have two daughters in college. %$* 672
and a growing number of their friends are graduating from college, and they can't get jobs. %$* 672
we have 26 million americans at the moment who are either unemployed or underemployed. %$* 672
and we don't have any plan that the two parties seem to be capable of, of how to bring jobs about. %$* 672
so there is a huge dysfunctionality. %$* 672
and the results are really incredibly profound. %$* 672
i mean, they are changing the nature of this country. %$* 672
upward mobility has been at the heart of the american dream. %$* 672
now we are number ten when it comes to upward mobility. %$* 672
we are behind france and germany. %$* 672
excuse me, but being behind france in upward mobility is like france being behind us in croissants and afternoon sex. %$* 672
but to p.j.'s point about this it’s just your dumb kids. %$* 13
why is that about the two-party system and not about everything else? %$* 13
well, the idea that it’s dumb kids that are the problem is just charming p.j.i mean, whatever p.j.says, he's charming because he's funny. %$* 672
but it's not true. %$* 672
and that's our debate for this evening. %$* 13
zev chafets, come on in. %$* 13
well, i would say not true is-- %$* 674
that's pretty definitive. %$* 674
the notion of being in a debate with arianna huffington arguing that america has lost its ability to have upward mobility is a startling experience. %$* 674
and i want to say something about david's notion about bipartisanship. %$* 674
two things quickly, first of all, polarization is a good thing, not a bad thing. %$* 674
in countries where you don't have polarized political debate, you have no debate. %$* 674
severity does not equal democracy. %$* 674
and in the many countries that i've visited, and you've all visited and been to and i’m sure many of you where you haven’t heard harsh debate, you have been in the countries that are being ruled, not in democratic ways and societies that are open. %$* 674
and the other thing about this golden age of advise and consent when all the congressmen got together, the senators got together and had cocktails and so on, and there’s no bipartisanship anymore, i just want to say the following words, no child left behind which was passed in a bipartisan way, the medicaid prescription-- %$* 674
medicare prescription, the tax cuts, the bush tax cuts, the iraq war which like it or not was a bipartisan affair, the tarp stuff, the healthcare bill which was passed in a – a mono- partisan way-- %$* 674
all right, let me-- %$* 13
all of these things have been passed in the last 10 years. %$* 674
first, on the civility point, screw off, you fat bastard. %$* 344
let’s go, let’s go! %$* 344
no, i believe in conflict, i’m a columnist, conflict is fine with me. %$* 344
and i’m fine with that as long as it’s constructive. %$* 344
the problem is we have parties that don’t represent the country. %$* 344
we now have, here’s a fact from morris fiorina, stanford political scientist, more people own ferrets than watch fox news. %$* 344
and so, but we have a party-- %$* 344
isn't there a lot of overlap? %$* 673
that's a good point, yeah. %$* 344
glenn beck’s ferret is loose. %$* 344
but we have a party that’s sort of dictated by that small group, and in the democratic party we have a party dictated by the public sector employee unions. %$* 344
and you’ve got vast numbers of people whose views are not basically represented, so the country is still a bell curve country, and the rest of the-- %$* 344
and the two-party system is not. %$* 344
and therefore you don’t have-- %$* 344
just tell us what you mean by bell curve? %$* 13
a bell curve is like this, most people in the middle. %$* 344
and so you don’t have constructive competition, which would be us talking and then reaching an agreement after an hour, you just have, eh, you guys suck. %$* 344
but, david, can i just say that in the last election the republicans nominated john mccain, a more reasonable republican than that would be hard to find. %$* 674
and the democrats nominated barack obama who was the soul of reasonableness, and so much is in favor of civility that he said at my alma mater, the university of michigan, “if you are people who listen to rush limbaugh and glenn beck, then read some articles on the huffington post.” that's what you have. %$* 674
those are the two leaders of the major parties at least until the next election. %$* 674
i don't think that you can make the case that these are extremists who don't talk to one another or who are civil with one another. %$* 674
compare pre-nomination john mccain to post-nomination john mccain and see what a guy has to do to get elected. %$* 344
arianna huffington, if you-- %$* 13
you said that democracy cannot be a spectator sport. %$* 13
your opponents are saying that americans by nature are not ideological. %$* 13
maybe those two things are not necessarily in conflict with each other, but do you take their point that for the most part, americans aren't that into politics and therefore that makes the parties rather irrelevant? %$* 13
i think americans don't believe that our current-- %$* 672
could i just ask you just to move a little closer to your mic. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 672
americans don't believe that our current political system is working. %$* 672
that's why you have 37 percent of americans who are registered as independents because they don't believe our current two-party system is delivering what the country needs. %$* 672
and increasingly young people who really do want to find solutions to our problems are choosing civic engagement instead of political engagement. %$* 672
who have long waiting lists for people to join teach for america, so it's not as if they've given up on making the world better. %$* 672
i mean, p.j. and zev may have given up on making the world better but-- %$* 672
young people haven't, they just don't see the political route through the two-party system as the way to make the world better, but if we give up on making the world better then we might as well give up on everything. %$* 672
you know, i mean, i think in the end churchill was right, he said americans can be counted to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other possibility. %$* 672
and the two-party system is one of the other possibilities we have now exhausted. %$* 672
p.j. o'rourke. %$* 13
i don't at all feel fatalist about this. %$* 673
and i don't feel like standing pat. %$* 673
i think we are in the middle of a huge fight. %$* 673
i think tea party is a very good example. %$* 673
i keep waiting for the democratic party to have the equivalent. %$* 673
i hope that it will. %$* 673
i think we're in the midst of a political realignment going on in the united states. %$* 673
i think our opponents mistake a current situation for a permanent situation. %$* 673
i think that the american politics goes through phases like this, and you know people say, “oh, it's more polarized now than it's ever been,” and i'm going, like the 60s? %$* 673
that wasn’t polarized? %$* 673
you know, the 1860s, that wasn’t polarized? %$* 673
so, are you saying, p.j., we may be temporarily ungovernable? %$* 13
yeah, i mean, we’re temporarily badly governed. %$* 673
you know, and i think that that happens a lot, and i think that, you know-- %$* 673
this budget crisis will not go away. %$* 673
sooner or later, these dumb sobs down in washington are going to have to face up to this fact. %$* 673
and, you know, if the pass is anything to go by, they will. %$* 673
i still keep waiting for hearing what is the alternative to the system that we have now. %$* 673
i’m open to the idea that there might be an alternative, but i’m not hearing any alternative. %$* 673
i’m hearing merely a criticism of the system that we’ve got now. %$* 673
well, that’s all they actually need to prove. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 672
well fine-- %$* 673
but it does raise the point %$* 13
it’s a very, very important point that i think the audience will want to hear from you, arianna. %$* 13
as opposed to what? %$* 13
well, first of all, let me just say that the motion is “the two-party system is making american ungovernable.” and i hope you’ve all heard our opponents make our case again and again and again. %$* 672
in fact, p.j.just said, it’s not good right now, but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to get better. %$* 672
absolutely. %$* 672
all we are saying is that we need to take steps to make it better. %$* 672
we can’t just wait by the sidelines and expect it to get better. %$* 672
and the fastest way to make it better is to shake up a dysfunctional and stagnant two- party system. %$* 672
that’s all we have to prove. %$* 672
but how? %$* 13
that’s all we are arguing. %$* 672
well, the primary way is to allow more competition. %$* 672
all of us believe in competition, right? %$* 672
it’s the essence of a private enterprise, freedom- based system. %$* 672
we believe in competition in everything except politics. %$* 672
when it comes to politics, you’ve got to pick your party and run with your party, and actually espouse whatever the party stands for at that particular moment. %$* 672
one election cycle, it may be abortion or no abortion-- %$* 672
the social issues, this election cycle, and it’s around issues that have to do with the shrinking government on the republican side. %$* 672
so, that’s not the way to fundamentally change the conditions we are all living under. %$* 672
zev chafets or p.j., if you are ready to move on, i can go to the audience for questions, but if you’d like to respond? %$* 13
i’m still not hearing-- %$* 673
i don’t-- %$* 674
i’m with p.j. we’re talking about a two-party system in an actual world, or a different political system in an actual world. %$* 674
the two-party system is a very long-standing-- %$* 674
and by the way, it has plenty of room for independents, which are part of the system, and also for third-party candidates, which are a function of every election, whether it’s ross perot or whether it’s pat buchanan, or you can’t name an election-- %$* 674
or henry wallace, or george wallace or-- %$* 674
you can’t name an election that hasn’t had a third-party candidate or more-- %$* 674
or usually a big nut. %$* 673
the fact that people don’t want to vote for them is not the same thing as saying that they don’t exist. %$* 674
and i think that we have to-- %$* 674
since we’re talking about reality and not utopia, i think we have to ask ourselves, who, on this stage, the four of us-- %$* 674
the three of you are all brilliant, and john, of course, is also. %$* 674
if the five of us, and i’m just old-- %$* 674
i have more age. %$* 674
i’m older than p.j.by a couple of months, so i have seniority. %$* 674
but if the five of us had to sit down and devise a better political system, even with the wizards on this panel, i don’t think we would be able to do it. %$* 674
and even if the whole audience participated, we probably might not get there. %$* 674
we have a political-- %$* 674
there is a political system in this country, and thank god there is. %$* 674
it provides stability, and it’s grown organically. %$* 674
it’s grown organically over the course of 235 years – %$* 673
okay, you’ve had a good run. %$* 13
let’s let david brooks-- %$* 13
speaking of this long duration, you know, i grew up here at nyu.i went to the university of chicago, a baptist school where atheist professors teach jewish students saint thomas aquinas. %$* 344
i’m used to long historical visions, and the idea that “oh, it’s sort of always been like this,” it’s just not true. %$* 344
let’s take my pet issue, the deficit. %$* 344
every generation has an incentive to pass debt off on the future generations, but no generation until the current one has done it because the political system-- %$* 344
finally, our dream come true. %$* 673
was able to mobilize and basically exercise some self control and cut deals. %$* 344
ronald reagan did the biggest tax increase in american history because the political system then basically worked. %$* 344
the parties are now different than they were then. %$* 344
all right, we’re going to go to some audience questions when we come back. %$* 13
we are back. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
that didn’t last long. %$* 674
wouldn’t it be great if commercials really worked that way? %$* 13
tivo for life. %$* 13
we are back. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” we have two teans of two debaters each trying to change your minds. %$* 13
and i'd like to go now to the audience for some questions. %$* 13
and gentleman with the glasses and neck tie. %$* 13
a mic will come to you. %$* 13
and if you could stand up just so that the camera can find you. %$* 13
and if you can keep it terse and questioning. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 18
this is terrific. %$* 18
my question is to the panelists in favor of the resolution. %$* 18
and it's at the theme that you were just discussing. %$* 18
given the fact that the two-party system happened by itself, bottom up, organically, to use p.j.'s word, how exactly would you get rid of it, or perhaps worse, what would you impose and in what way? %$* 18
david brooks. %$* 13
first, i'm not necessarily for realignment, but de-alignment. %$* 344
we're seeing all sorts of social movements that are growing up organically like the tea party, like the obama movement, like move on. %$* 344
i'd like to see a lot more of those movements in order to loosen up the parties. %$* 344
and the second thing, i do think there has been an historical tradition, which i talked about, from hamilton to lincoln and maybe to moderate republicans and moderate democrats today, the very few that exist. %$* 344
that tradition is unrepresented by our politics. %$* 344
and i think that long american historic tradition deserves a voice. %$* 344
so those would be two things i'd change. %$* 344
and i would add that-- %$* 672
arianna huffington. %$* 13
movement politics really leads us to what i call hope 2.0. %$* 672
you know, if obama was about hope, which is just basically hope being channeled to one of the two parties. %$* 672
hope 2.0 is about hope being channeled to multiple movements, a community solution, people all around the country unleashing an enormous amount of creativity and ingenuity around finding solutions at the local level. %$* 672
we in the media are doing a lousy job of putting a spotlight on what is working. %$* 672
we need to do a much better job. %$* 672
we need to help them scale up. %$* 672
and this is really part of what we are talking about. %$* 672
arianna, don't you feel that the parties actually are responsive to movements, or they're affected by them ultimately will co-op them? %$* 13
no, i think-- %$* 672
be shaped by them? %$* 13
i think to a large extent the parties use movements during election times. %$* 672
i mean, look at the obama movement. %$* 672
once obama was in the white house, he basically disappeared. %$* 672
they are now trying to reconstitute it because he is beginning to run for the election. %$* 672
that's not what makes a thriving movement. %$* 672
a movement is something which organically continues to grow through elections and beyond them. %$* 672
and that's what we need more of. %$* 672
people do not trust establishments. %$* 672
i mean, look at the tea party movement. %$* 672
it's fundamentally anti-establishment. %$* 672
look at what's happening among young people on the democrat side, fundamentally anti- establishment. %$* 672
the numbers of mistrust when it comes to our national institutions has skyrocketed. %$* 672
we need to address that. %$* 672
otherwise we are becoming an increasingly dysfunctional society. %$* 672
zev chafets, your opponent. %$* 13
well, first of all, i want to take issue with the characterization of the obama movement. %$* 674
obama was the nominee of the democratic party. %$* 674
he wasn't a movement candidate. %$* 674
he was a candidate of one of the two major parties. %$* 674
had he been only a movement candidate, he would have gotten three percent of the vote or five percent of the vote or whatever movement candidates get. %$* 674
but he went through the system, and he's a part of the system. %$* 674
as far as the notion of young people speaking their minds and getting so much resistance from behind. %$* 674
we're talk-- %$* 674
that's not a good idea, arianna. %$* 674
really, it's not. %$* 674
it's great for everybody to participate. %$* 674
and i'm glad that there's an internet and all of the cool stuff that we've got these days in participatory facebook and all the rest of it. %$* 674
but since everybody's quoting the founding fathers, john adams also said that political parties are there to govern passion. %$* 674
and something needs to govern the un-channeled passions of all of the marvelous passion that kids have and young people have and disaffected people have and anti-establishmentarian people have, and they all can exist within the framework of the two-party system as they have ever since 1865, whenever the civil war ended, in my opinion. %$* 674
all right. %$* 13
let's go to another question. %$* 13
right in the center. %$* 13
it might help-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
you're - - you're the only one with your hand up in the front row. %$* 13
and a mic is going to come down this way to you. %$* 13
and if you don't mind standing again. %$* 13
i know you're right in front. %$* 13
with the growth of social media and the 24/7 news cycle, what role do you see the media playing in helping reinforce the current two-party system or changing it for the future? %$* 19
can i ask you what you think the media's role is so far in that regard? %$* 13
do you think it's ossifying the system; it's keeping it in place or-- %$* 13
is that somewhat of your lament? %$* 13
i think it's keeping it in place. %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
so what you're really asking is can that change, i think. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
arianna huffington, sounds like a %$* 13
yeah, i completely agree with you. %$* 672
and if you look, for example, at the way the media describes our political problems, it’s reflexively through that prism of right versus left. %$* 672
i mean, i mentioned afghanistan in my opening statement, wall street reform, unemployment. %$* 672
why is it left wing to care about helping people get jobs? %$* 672
and yet that's how it's portrayed in the media. %$* 672
but if you look at how the discussion is, say, on social media, it's very different. %$* 672
does not accept those very stale distinctions. %$* 672
so we have a responsibility, those of us in the media and everybody else, to participate in that and change it. %$* 672
and increasingly, more and more, people are participating, and self- expression has become a kind of form of self-fulfillment. %$* 672
more people are participating, uploading videos. %$* 672
we saw it not just here. %$* 672
we saw it in what happened in egypt recently. %$* 672
we saw a phenomenal outpouring of something which i suppose you might regard dangerous because it's leading to uncontrollable passions. %$* 672
but it's also leading to freedom, liberation and other things that uncontrollable passions provide. %$* 672
you need to see the expressions on the faces over there. %$* 13
very briefly, because i think we know where you're going. %$* 13
the reason that the social media was necessary in egypt, because it was a one-party state. %$* 674
it's not a two-party state. %$* 674
that's the whole point of this. %$* 674
everything-- %$* 674
two-party state. %$* 673
within the two-party system. %$* 674
you don't need-- %$* 674
you don't need a mob of facebook- inspired democrats if you have the ability to nominate candidates then vote for them. %$* 674
and then-- %$* 674
well, first of all, the fact that you are calling it a mob shows what respect you have for them. %$* 672
the other thing is that-- %$* 672
what did you think they were? %$* 674
i mean, what are they? %$* 674
were they-- %$* 674
why is it a mob? %$* 672
why are people who are organizing on facebook or through twitter in order to overthrow an oppressive regime a mob? %$* 672
ask lara logan. %$* 674
all right. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
let's move on. %$* 13
gentleman, if you can stand up. %$* 13
yeah, i think one of the reasons the country was more governable in the past, one of the reasons we had overlap between the parties, which i think was mentioned, is that we had much more of a common narrative in the past. %$* 18
the parties agreed more on what the facts were and then disagreed on their interpretations of them. %$* 18
so you could have, as p.j. would say, the stupid and the silly arguments for the-- %$* 18
but what era are you talking about, because there were plenty of times when they didn't-- %$* 13
up until recently. %$* 18
today, we have a greater bifurcation in the news than we've ever had. %$* 18
we have fox on one side, we have msnbc on the other. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
so what would your question be? %$* 13
perhaps the problem here is that the country may be ungovernable, but it's not the two- party system that's the problem. %$* 18
rather, the problem is the way information now flows through the country and the way we end up with essentially tribes around facts as opposed to simply tribes around interpretation. %$* 18
p.j. o'rourke in response. %$* 13
bifurcation you're talking about. %$* 673
i think there is a tendency to take the period from about the end of the korean war through, say, johnson's great society, as being somehow normative in american history. %$* 673
it is not. %$* 673
the two political parties were, of course, violently polarized in the civil war, quite polarized after the civil war, extremely polarized during the 1920s, extremely polarized during the-- %$* 673
during the 1930s. %$* 673
they are extremely polarized right now. %$* 673
i would argue that polarization is more normal than not. %$* 673
as far as there being some sort of media voice of common wisdom and some sort of-- %$* 673
some sort of objectivity in the media, that was like a sort of little false advertising campaign of the new york times over the course of about one decade, you know? %$* 673
american newspapers have traditionally been just hysterically partisan. %$* 673
i mean, if you go back through the history of the american press, it has almost entirely been advocating-- %$* 673
and usually in the loosest and most irresponsible way, one particular-- %$* 673
so p.j., let me put your central point to the other side. %$* 13
you're saying that polarization is the norm most of the time. %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
fighting is the norm. %$* 344
polarization like we've seen is not the norm. %$* 344
this is actually statistically demonstrable. %$* 344
political scientists take a look at how many votes cross party lines, how many times in each congress people actually reach bipartisan deals. %$* 344
and the number now is at all time lows, it's cycled through history, but it’s never been like this. %$* 344
people fought lyndon johnson in the '60s, fought-- %$* 344
but lyndon johnson was able to fashion coalitions. %$* 344
henry clay, people then fought, they were able to fashion coalitions. %$* 344
the problem is not that they were fighting. %$* 344
i’m all for fighting, the problem is that each party has become more rigid in my own lifetime of covering this stuff. %$* 344
when i came to washington in the early '80s i could go to back benchers like jack kemp or newt gingrich on the republican side, they had all these weird ideas they were trying to push on leadership. %$* 344
that doesn’t happen, the leaders control everything now. %$* 344
the nature of the parties has changed. %$* 344
this time is different. %$* 13
yes. %$* 344
okay, question, ma’am, with the scarf, and the mic is coming to your left side. %$* 13
one of the reasons that the parties seem to have so much more power now is the control of the money. %$* 19
and even though there have been attempts to do campaign finance reform we seem to be moving even further away from that goal rather than to trying to diffuse some of that. %$* 19
how do you respond to that and is that affecting our two-party system today? %$* 19
arianna? %$* 13
you write about this a lot. %$* 13
absolutely, i think that’s a very important point and especially with the citizens' united decision. %$* 672
as you said we see the stronghold of money on our political system, the power of special interest, the fact that we have dozens of lobbyists per member of congress, the fact that even when good legislation is passed it’s undermined at the committee stage. %$* 672
all those things have made us ungovernable, because even when-- %$* 672
and we have mining reform for example, then you go back and you look at how it was all watered down to the point where the virginia mining disaster could happen. %$* 672
even when you have regulators living inside lehman brothers or fannie and freddie, they were not able to prevent the regulator recapture that allowed the financial meltdown to happen. %$* 672
i mean we have lost trillions in private wealth. %$* 672
we have the greatest increase in poverty in the suburbs at the moment. %$* 672
we are becoming a third world country and if we don’t pay attention now, if we don’t do something where they stand to course correct then it’s going to be too late. %$* 672
and that’s why this is the time to sound the alarm, recognize it to have become ungovernable and change the system. %$* 672
all right, more questions from the audience when we come back. %$* 13
you know what would actually help me come back is if i could have one of those rounds of applause that you hear when-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we are back with this intelligence squared u.s.debate, i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
our motion is "the two-party system is making america ungovernable." arguing for the motion we have arianna huffington and david brooks. %$* 13
arguing against, zev chafets and p.j.o'rourke, and going to a question from the audience, gentleman with the eyeglasses. %$* 13
and i again want to urge you because we're starting to stray a little bit to make these questions that are terse and that are related to the topic please, so you're first. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
so responding to mr. %$* 18
chafets, the united states is above the 90th percentile in terms of governance compared to the entire world but that's a pretty low bar to set for the world's richest and most powerful country. %$* 18
but my question is for the side in favor of it, in my native canada there is about 80,000 people for every member of parliament. %$* 18
and we have a chance to meet them much more than here where there's about 800,000 people for every member or member of the house, and i'm wondering if it's-- %$* 18
do you think that it's a problem with the two-party system or is the country just too large to be governed? %$* 18
there are many multiparty countries in northern europe that are much better governed than us but they're smaller. %$* 18
i guess i would say-- %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
- i was born in canada, bula bula. %$* 344
you know, i'm actually not sure that's it because members of congress fly home every weekend. %$* 344
that's one of the reasons their lives are so miserable and they hold town meetings. %$* 344
and a lot of places-- %$* 344
i meant the flight, not the getting there-- %$* 344
they hold town meetings and if they can get 30 or 50 people to show up they're happy, they love to meet people, they spend a lot of time meeting people. %$* 344
and as i said they have this you and i need food and water, they just need social love, that's what they need. %$* 344
and so i don't think that's it. %$* 344
i don't think it's when they go home that the problem is, i think it's when they come to washington and are surrounded by a psychological vortex. %$* 344
i just wanted to make that explicit. %$* 344
i think the psychology within the parties has changed-- %$* 344
and, p.j., i think you're almost arguing that the bluntness of-- %$* 13
by design of a large system with two parties that you feel have a lot of ideological overlap is perfect for a gigantic country like this one. %$* 13
well, i think that it is because i think the intrusion of third parties and other interests just has a tendency to act as a sort of spoiler situation, basically throwing the race to george w.bush instead of to al gore who would have been such a wonderful president. %$* 673
anyway, you know, that’s another matter. %$* 673
yeah, i do think it suits us. %$* 673
you know, the problem, of course, is when we face the kind of crisis like we have at the moment that is both extremely pressing and yet, unlike pearl harbor, is not perfectly immediate. %$* 673
our system is extremely slow to respond. %$* 673
do we want to live in a country with a political system that is a little too slow to respond, or do we want to live in one of those countries where the political system is a little too quick to respond? %$* 673
i pick slowness, myself. %$* 673
would you like to respond, arianna huffington? %$* 13
well, because it depends on the kind of problems we are facing. %$* 672
and if we are really willing to recognize the problems that we are facing now and how serious they are, when it comes to unemployment, when it comes to foreclosures, when it comes to bankruptcies, when it comes to the fact that growing numbers of kids can’t afford college, and if they graduated from college can’t get jobs. %$* 672
i mean, these are serious problems. %$* 672
and they are also leading to a kind of political instability and a kind of demonizing our opponents, which always happens during times of deep economic anxiety, when it was the 1880s when we were expelling chinese workers, or the 1930s when we were expelling hispanic workers who were actually american citizens. %$* 672
you see what the problems are when we are not taking steps to deal with them in a timely manner. %$* 672
okay, i’m going to go to another question. %$* 13
and i’m raising my hand to my face because i have difficulty seeing farther up. %$* 13
there’s a woman in a blue top. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i think this debate is great, but i think one of the concerns that a lot of people have is how do you shift away from a two-party system. %$* 19
basically, how do you cope with the “nader effect” where the balance becomes shift too far in one direction as you’re trying to divide the parties? %$* 19
can you rephrase that in a way that would help people, when they hear the answers, settle their mind on our motion? %$* 13
because i think you can. %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 19
i guess, basically, i’m more concerned with the details of how, what type of plan do we implement to move away from the two-party-- %$* 19
so you’re asking what this side is asking when they are saying “as opposed to what? %$* 13
” is that what you’re asking? %$* 13
i’m basically just trying to figure out, how do we move away from the two-party system? %$* 19
yeah, as opposed to what? %$* 673
a three-party system? %$* 19
a four-party system? %$* 19
a 12-party system? %$* 19
okay, but i’m sure-- %$* 13
how do we divide the parties into the different groups without shifting power too far in one direction-- %$* 19
do you want to take that question on? %$* 13
yeah, arianna or david? %$* 13
yeah, i would say that even though we don’t have to take that question in doing the debate, we are very willing to take that question on. %$* 672
and there are many voting measures that could be put in place if the two-party system did not have a stronghold on the current electoral system that would make it possible, for example. %$* 672
if you voted for ralph nader, and if ralph nader did not win, for your vote to go to your second choice. %$* 672
i mean, that is a completely plausible system that can be implemented immediately if the two parties did not prevent it from being implemented. %$* 672
david brooks. %$* 13
just another role is non-party primaries. %$* 344
i mean, if you look at the most disaffected people, they’re not actually where nader is or not where libertarians are. %$* 344
they’re in the middle 37 percent of the country basically feels disaffected. %$* 344
but they have no candidates to vote for in general elections because they’re just not offered them. %$* 344
and if you had non-party primaries, you’d have a better shot they’d have a voice. %$* 344
and that’s a point that i’d brought to you before from their argument that you didn’t really respond to is that they’re talking about the system as it is, really leaving people with such distasteful choices that they don’t have choices, and that that’s a lot of people, and that that’s what they feel is a major flaw in a democracy. %$* 13
zev chafets? %$* 13
i confess that i don’t understand the premise or the question. %$* 674
that there’s a lot of people who don’t feel they’re represented by these parties. %$* 13
yeah, and in multi-party systems, there are many people who also don’t feel that they’re representing by any of the parties. %$* 674
and i, having lived in a country that has 14 parties, i can tell you that i didn't find any that represented me. %$* 674
that's an inherent problem of democracy. %$* 674
if you have a party that fits the taste of every person or every group of people, you'll have hundreds or a multiplicity of parties that makes it impossible to govern. %$* 674
and if you have any system, whether it's a two-party system or a proportional representational system or a different kind of parliamentary system, i assure you-- %$* 674
and i've lived through this. %$* 674
i'm telling you from personal experience-- %$* 674
that professional politicians will always find a way to game whatever reform you make in the electoral system because they're better at it than you are and i am. %$* 674
that's what they do for a living. %$* 674
exactly. %$* 673
and therefore i think that if you have something that is open to everyone, anybody can vote in this country. %$* 674
anybody can join a party in this country. %$* 674
anybody could run for office in this country. %$* 674
that's great. %$* 674
if, as p.j.says, many people aren't interested, then they're not interested. %$* 674
but you can't force anybody-- %$* 674
the only place i know where people are forced to vote is in north vietnam, i mean north korea. %$* 674
australia. %$* 18
australia? %$* 674
it's called the donkey vote, the people that vote because %$* 673
and if you get attention of one of the mics, thanks. %$* 13
at nyu, we have the privilege to have some very good faculty, including professor steven j.brams, who talks about approval voting, which is one of the systems they talked about, where if your first choice doesn't get elected, your voice goes to your second choice and down the line. %$* 18
it produces more democratic outcomes and would reduce polarity in the parties. %$* 18
my question is, why would this be a negative thing to institute? %$* 18
why would making elections more accessible to people, you know, things like approval voting or letting people vote electronically be a bad thing? %$* 18
and if there are other measures, what is a good way to explore them to bring them into the american system to reform elections-- %$* 18
i don't have any inherent objection to this. %$* 673
i think it's interesting that we're hearing the solutions to the problem posited here more from the audience than from the other side. %$* 673
but one of the beauties of america's federalist system, of our highly decentralized system with all sorts of-- %$* 673
states are essentially in charge of voting laws as long as they don't forbid people from voting because they belong to a category such as women or such as blacks. %$* 673
they actually-- %$* 673
states have enormous latitude in control of the election laws. %$* 673
and the fact that we have this flexible system would allow us to try things out like that. %$* 673
maybe they would work beautifully and would produce the kind of results that you think that they might. %$* 673
maybe they would produce perverse and bizarre results. %$* 673
and we'd find out. %$* 673
i'm thinking your opponents are saying, though, that the system-- %$* 13
that the way the system runs now has such a stranglehold on the way the system runs now that those reforms are unlikely to be put into place. %$* 13
am i anticipating? %$* 13
well, i mean, let's take this case right here. %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
we've got a 5-foot 6-inch jewish guy who runs this city, mayor bloomberg. %$* 344
he thought about running-- %$* 344
he's jewish? %$* 673
who knew? %$* 673
i'm amazed he's 5-foot-6.so he thought about running for president. %$* 344
and he had some money, i hear. %$* 344
and so he thought, well, you know-- %$* 344
and there were a lot of people who were disaffected. %$* 344
so could i win? %$* 344
and then he said, well, i could win some states, probably not all of them, but i could win some. %$* 344
and then it would get thrown into the house of representatives, a body staffed entirely by republicans and democrats. %$* 344
there's no way they're going to vote for me. %$* 344
and so he was dissuaded from running as a third-party candidate by the fact that the two parties have a stranglehold on the presidential process. %$* 344
and this is bad? %$* 674
depends on how you feel about mayor bloomberg. %$* 673
one of you guys just said mayor bloomberg ran the city well. %$* 344
i think it was you. %$* 344
i think he did run the-- %$* 674
he does run the city well. %$* 674
want to let him out of the city. %$* 673
i’ll live here. %$* 673

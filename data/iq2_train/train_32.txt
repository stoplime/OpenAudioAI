it's caused me to be more productive. %$* 211
it causes you to be more productive. %$* 211
it causes you to be smarter. %$* 211
your children right now have access to the world knowledge. %$* 211
they just get on their ipads or their iphones and they're connected to everyone else by social media, by twitter. %$* 211
they're able to go into websites. %$* 211
they're able to gain knowledge from everywhere. %$* 211
they would hire in new delhi or get video production done in estonia, like i did. %$* 211
this is a new world we live in. %$* 211
it's all open. %$* 211
and it's not falling apart. %$* 211
we're moving up the ramp. %$* 211
this is the most productive, most innovative period in human history, when the world will come together and start solving problems. %$* 211
there's not going to be a mass migration to america, because as we see, from mexico, the numbers have actually dropped. %$* 211
as the economy in mexico rises, there's less incentive for them to come over here. %$* 211
if they can do knowledge work for us where they are and contribute to our intellect and our knowledge, they will do that. %$* 211
they don't want to be here. %$* 211
they love being where they are. %$* 211
no one is fleeing to america because, you know, they want to. %$* 211
they do it because they have to. %$* 211
so, let's uplift the whole world. %$* 211
let's make the world a smaller place and everyone wins. %$* 211
it's a better world. %$* 211
it's a better economy. %$* 211
and we solve major problems. %$* 211
thank you. %$* 13
vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
our motion is, let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and here to offer her opening statement against this motion, kathleen newland. %$* 13
she is co-founder and trustee of the migration policy institute, where she directs policy programs on migrants, migration, and development, and refugee protection. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome, please, kathleen newland. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thanks to all of you. %$* 212
it's wonderful to be here in this extremely stimulating company. %$* 212
i'd like to remind vivek, and the rest of the panel that our proposition tonight is let-- %$* 212
is not let anyone take an anywhere job. %$* 212
it's let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 212
and i want to ask you to consider what the world would really be like if anyone could take a job anywhere. %$* 212
as a theoretical proposition, it's very attractive. %$* 212
economic models where other things are always equal show that world gdp would go up. %$* 212
but i'd like us to think about those other things, which in the real world are never equal. %$* 212
as john donvan and mr. %$* 212
rosenkranz said, this is not a debate about immigration. %$* 212
i think immigration is a very good thing for the united states. %$* 212
and almost always it's a very good thing for immigrants. %$* 212
and most of the time, it's even a good thing for the countries that people are leaving, as they send back remittances, and transmit knowledge, and sometimes create companies and jobs in their home countries. %$* 212
but for a debate that's really not-- %$* 212
this debate is really not about immigration. %$* 212
it's about how our societies are organized. %$* 212
do you think that we should expect our government to try to manage the numbers and the kinds of people who join our societies? %$* 212
i don't mean micromanage. %$* 212
i just mean setting a fair and reasonable framework for the labor market in which both immigrants who come here and people who are born here compete. %$* 212
we shouldn't outsource that very important function of deciding how our societies are organized to employers. %$* 212
that's not to demonize employers. %$* 212
they're the engines of our economies. %$* 212
but it's not their job to pursue the public good, to pursue the best organization for the largest number of people who live in any given country. %$* 212
labor markets are social institutions as well as economic institutions, and they have geography. %$* 212
despite the fact that many jobs are mobile, not all jobs are mobile. %$* 212
and especially the jobs that are done by less skilled people into today's world are not mobile. %$* 212
those jobs in the service sector, the gardeners, the food service workers, the childcare and elder care workers. %$* 212
those jobs have geography. %$* 212
and we need immigrants to come and fill them. %$* 212
but we need to set a framework in which that's an orderly process, in which it is as much as possible, a legal process. %$* 212
we need to open channels so that the people we need to come and do those jobs can do them legally. %$* 212
but it doesn't mean anyone can take a job anywhere. %$* 212
why? %$* 212
well, as i mentioned, labor markets are social institutions. %$* 212
they're the main channel in our society through which income is distributed. %$* 212
and we have a choice of whether we want to live in a low income, low productivity society with a vastly larger labor market or whether we want to live in a society where people earn higher incomes and have higher productivity and where we import and export and-- %$* 212
including through the web-- %$* 212
of the services that can be done more cheaply elsewhere. %$* 212
having anyone do a job anywhere, having high levels of immigration to fulfill that vision carries a lot of externalities with it. %$* 212
we don't-- %$* 212
i don't think most people would want to live in a society where immigrants can't have their families join them over long periods of time. %$* 212
we don't want to live in their society where we don't educate the children of immigrants, we don't provide healthcare to immigrants, we don't provide adequate shelter or allow people the means to acquire adequate shelter; so there are costs associated with immigration, not that those costs aren't worth it. %$* 212
i believe they are. %$* 212
but we have to face the fact that building adequate infrastructure, supplying adequate public services takes some planning, takes some funding, takes some upfront costs. %$* 212
and that's a good reason to regulate our-- %$* 212
the intake to our labor markets. %$* 212
i think there is also a question about values in here. %$* 212
i've mentioned some of them already about what kind of society we ought to live in. %$* 212
but it's also about who gets to decide. %$* 212
and i have great sympathy. %$* 212
i work on development issues. %$* 212
i work with refugees. %$* 212
i have great sympathy for bryan's idea that, you know, it's a moral obligation to let people reach for the same good life that many-- %$* 212
most people have in the united states, at least in relative terms, or in other developed countries. %$* 212
but the fact is that we live in sovereign states. %$* 212
and there's a good reason that we do. %$* 212
in 1648, the system was set up to end centuries of religious wars, to end external interference in the societies, in organized societies. %$* 212
and although we've evolved from the sovereignty of kings to popular sovereignty, i think there's still a question of who gets to decide. %$* 212
and i don't believe it's practical to have the-- %$* 212
to decide for the entire world that we will have the same standard of living. %$* 212
we live in a real world in which immigrants, in which workers are not just units of production. %$* 212
they're members of our societies. %$* 212
and we have to make the kind of provision for people to live in the kind of societies that you want to live in. %$* 212
and, to my mind, is a good reason to vote no against the proposition that anyone should be able to take a job anywhere. %$* 212
thank you. %$* 212
thank you, kathleen newland. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is "let anyone take a job anywhere." remember how you voted at the beginning of the debate on this proposition. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms, in terms of your support of this proposition, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address each other in turn and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
the motion is this: "let anyone take a job anywhere." and arguing for the motion, we've heard bryan caplan and vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
and they have argued several points. %$* 13
they've come at it several ways. %$* 13
they've argued that actually giving a job to anyone anywhere is common decency. %$* 13
not to do so is a form of discrimination against foreign workers that in itself violates that decency; that opening borders globally, they cite a statistic that says it would actually double global production, which the other side did not refute. %$* 13
they also say that we're on this road already, that in one sector of the economy, the knowledge economy, that this is already happening. %$* 13
and to quote vivek wadhwa, "the world is not falling apart." arguing against the motion, against the motion to let anyone take a job anywhere, we've heard from kathleen newland and ron unz. %$* 13
they have argued, while conceding the point that productivity, production would double globally, they also say that that would have terrible socially divisive effects because who would it benefit? %$* 13
they argue that that increase in production would benefit almost exclusively an economic elite, that the average person, the ordinary person would see their wages terribly depressed to be essentially in competition with 2 billion workers around the world. %$* 13
and they argue also that employment and labor is a geographically based thing. %$* 13
you have to be in the place. %$* 13
it's social. %$* 13
there are real costs. %$* 13
who's going to pay for the schooling of these moves of population? %$* 13
who's going to pay for the healthcare costs? %$* 13
it's not just a matter of individuals being units of labor. %$* 13
do you really want to give factory owners a decision about how society's organized, or do you want to give it-- %$* 13
i think they were saying-- %$* 13
to legislatures or maybe even kings. %$* 13
so that's where we are on hearing both sides of these arguments. %$* 13
and i want to take-- %$* 13
i want to go back and slice through some of what you were saying and have you interact on some of this. %$* 13
and i'm interested in bryan caplan's point when he was arguing for the motion to let anyone take a job anywhere, that not to do so is a form of discrimination against foreign workers. %$* 13
and i want to take that to your opponent, kathleen newland, because to a degree, it sounds as though you get what he's saying. %$* 13
and as somebody who works with refugees, you certainly have sympathy for foreign workers. %$* 13
you have an affinity obviously. %$* 13
but why is it not-- %$* 13
why is it not the kind of discrimination that bryan caplan was talking about? %$* 13
well, i think our governments are obliged to discriminate in our favor. %$* 212
that's part of the responsibility of government. %$* 212
that's part of the reason we have governments, to keep external forces from attacking us. %$* 212
that's why we have a national defense. %$* 212
and we have national labor market policies because we want to establish a certain level of living in this country. %$* 212
we don't want people to be paid $2 a day for their work in this country. %$* 212
we don't want workers' rights to be flouted at will, so we have rules, we have regulations, and we exert some control over who and what kind of people can come. %$* 212
let's hear bryan caplan's response. %$* 13
i'm just trying to imagine kathleen going to haiti and telling them, look, we need to keep you out because if we let you in, we'd have to give you free healthcare, and i don't feel like doing that. %$* 210
so you have to stay here. %$* 210
and that way we can maintain our standard of living. %$* 210
it just seems like, to anyone that was not already inside of your in group, this argument would be totally unconvincing because it would be so obvious that you really just don't care about them, and you're willing to do almost anything to people outside of your group. %$* 210
let me put it this way: when parents are judging a sporting event, they take extra effort to not show favoritism to their kids. %$* 210
why? %$* 210
because favoritism is in their hearts. %$* 210
what i'm saying is we need to be equally careful to not show favoritism of this kind to our fellow citizens. %$* 210
we need to make sure that we are treating people from other countries fairly. %$* 210
and this is not what you are doing. %$* 210
you know, the solution is something that ron-- %$* 211
vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
advocated, which is having a minimum wage. %$* 211
he has advocated 12 to 15 dollars. %$* 211
let’s say we did that. %$* 211
we would now lock out the billions that they're worried about. %$* 211
– ron. %$* 211
oh, i-- %$* 213
ron unz. %$* 13
agree entirely. %$* 213
in other words, if we had a very large rise in the minimum wage, maybe to $12 an hour, that by itself would alleviate a lot of the problems associated with immigration because, in a sense, if you have a situation where american workers can't be paid less than, say, $12 an hour, then even a huge amount of foreign competition would insure that ordinary american workers had a reasonable standard of living and maintained it. %$* 213
so the problem is-- %$* 211
vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
the minimum wage allowing people to come in for working for $2 an hour, we didn't say that-- %$* 211
you know, nowhere in this resolution are we talking about bringing in people at 50 cents an hour, $2 an hour, we're talking about if an employer wants to hire them. %$* 211
if i want to hire someone in chile and have them work for me, they should be allowed to work for me. %$* 211
wait. %$* 13
but you have-- %$* 211
let me say-- %$* 211
anybody can work anywhere for a minimum wage? %$* 13
well, why not-- %$* 211
well, you-- %$* 211
no one's saying that you have unlimited open borders and anyone can do anything. %$* 211
you have laws, you have customs, you have processes, and you have regulations. %$* 211
have good regulations, that-- %$* 211
the current minimum wage is too low. %$* 213
in other words, right now if you have a janitor earning nine or 10 or $11 an hour, and if he's suddenly put in competition with two billion workers around the world who are willing to work for anything, his wage would immediately go down to the minimum wage. %$* 213
in other words, all american workers would see their wages drop to the absolute minimum. %$* 213
labor unions would be destroyed. %$* 213
and the country would be impoverished. %$* 213
i mean if we had a much higher minimum wage, that problem would not be-- %$* 213
i want to just hear if-- %$* 13
the point that was just made, that in fact it would have a terribly depressing effect to be in competition with two billion workers sounds reasonable. %$* 13
i want to hear from bryan caplan. %$* 13
do you think that, that's accurate? %$* 13
no. %$* 210
so here's the important thing. %$* 210
while it's true-- %$* 210
well, are you going to-- %$* 13
you're going to tell us why? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 210
good. %$* 13
so if there are really only one kind of labor, then ron's theory is right, you let in a ton of people and wages go down. %$* 210
however, ron didn't get to the empirical part of economics, which is a really important part. %$* 210
here's the thing, there are many different kinds of labor. %$* 210
there are high skilled labor, mid-skilled labor, low skilled labor; you can go and read the most respected critic of immigration in the entire economics profession, george borjas, and all that he'll tell you is that immigration has been bad for high school dropouts. %$* 210
everyone else, he says there have been gains. %$* 210
so when you consider the effect of immigration, it's not going to be in effect upon all workers, it's going to be effect upon these narrow segments of workers who i said you could take care of them by having taxes or admission fees for low skilled workers-- %$* 210
or minimum wages. %$* 211
yes. %$* 210
let me-- %$* 13
ron's minimum wage idea is terrible, and ron could tell you why. %$* 210
the whole point of ron's minimum wage proposal is to keep out low skilled workers. %$* 210
he says it explicitly. %$* 210
i encourage you to read his piece. %$* 210
his goal is to make sure that anyone who is not worth $12 an hour, namely, most of the people on earth, are locked in their countries where they're earning a dollar a day. %$* 210
i think it'd be far better if they could come here and earn-- %$* 210
no, but i think we see-- %$* 212
hold on. %$* 13
hold on because i want to hear from the other side. %$* 13
kathleen newland. %$* 13
yeah, i think we see what happens in this kind of competition among low skilled laborers every day in the international labor markets where recruitment is handled by recruitment agents who arbitrage the difference between what people are willing to work for and what they're paid even at relatively low levels if you have the filipino worker going to the gulf, for example. %$* 212
a worker will pay $3,000, a third of his or her annual income, to get that job. %$* 212
so even if you have regulations, even if you have a minimum wage, you'll have people so eager to maybe not earn 20 times, maybe earn five times what they earn, that you will have-- %$* 212
i don't think you agree with that. %$* 211
i think you have-- %$* 212
let ron-- %$* 211
sure. %$* 13
again, it depends what-- %$* 213
thank you, vivek. %$* 13
ron unz. %$* 13
it's a matter of specific. %$* 213
in other words, it depends what minimum wage we're talking about. %$* 213
the minimum wage right now in the united states is very low. %$* 213
it's much lower in real terms than it was 40 years ago when the country was much more prosperous. %$* 213
if the minimum wage were higher, that would simply insure that there were a floor below which ordinary americans could not fall. %$* 213
under those circumstances, that restriction on the labor market means that even if there are a billion foreigners willing to take a job at any wages, you still have a situation where no american worker can be paid less than $12 an hour, which is enough to insure a reasonable standard of living for ordinary american workers. %$* 213
let me-- %$* 211
wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
vivek, one second, i want to move off the minimum wage. %$* 13
we did a great minimum wage debate-- %$* 13
i'm sure. %$* 211
a few months back. %$* 13
and i'm not saying that, that's not relevant because it obviously is. %$* 13
but i don't want us to just talk about that. %$* 13
i want to go a little bit to the point that vivek was making, that you-- %$* 13
as you pointed out, it's already happening at-- %$* 13
in the knowledge industry, that design is happening on single projects that are shared around the world. %$* 13
and you said, "and the world is not falling apart over that." but i want to take that argument to the other side. %$* 13
let's just look at the higher end of this for a time being, and then, vivek, i'll let you respond to their response to your argument, but the argument being it's kind of working out already at the higher end globally, that, you know, literally, the engineers who are designing for general motors or intel don't have to be in the united states, but they're certainly having an impact, i would think, on wages in the united states-- %$* 13
or are they? %$* 13
let's take kathleen newland. %$* 13
anyone who has an electrical engineering degree from a good university can take a job anywhere, yes. %$* 212
it's already on your plate-- %$* 212
and you're good with that? %$* 13
at the higher end, and i'm absolutely good with that. %$* 212
why are you good with that in that it's going to have an impact on wages globally as well, will it not? %$* 13
aren't there now hundreds of thousands more engineers in india competing with american engineers? %$* 13
well, we're not-- %$* 212
but they're not competing with them here. %$* 212
and, really, what i'm-- %$* 212
well, but vivek is saying-- %$* 13
talking about-- %$* 212
here doesn't matter, because the work-- %$* 13
well-- %$* 212
takes place across borders. %$* 13
so answer that. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i think here does matter. %$* 212
the engineer in india, unless, you know, he is at the top level of management, is not getting paid the same as the engineer in the united states. %$* 212
there is an arbitrage going on between-- %$* 212
but they're equalizing-- %$* 211
salaries keep rising worldwide and if you have more people doing innovation, you solve more problems. %$* 211
the economy rises. %$* 211
this is what's happening worldwide right now. %$* 211
i told you how i became more productive, how i could now crowd-source a book on innovating women by getting women all over the world to help me with it. %$* 211
there's no way i could have done that project if i didn't have access to all these amazing women all over the world. %$* 211
that's the magic that happens when you stop worrying about, you know, restrictions and-- %$* 211
you know, we'd have to block off the internet to stop the-- %$* 211
right. %$* 13
right. %$* 13
but her point is that you can't do a book. %$* 13
and you're playing the woman card quite effectively. %$* 13
her point-- %$* 13
well, what i-- %$* 211
her point-- %$* 13
her point, though-- %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
her-- %$* 211
her point is that the indian engineers are actually not making the same kind of money that engineers in silicon valley are making. %$* 13
the standards are rising. %$* 211
this is what-- %$* 211
it's not-- %$* 212
but it's, you know, it's not only about their salaries. %$* 212
it's also about that-- %$* 212
if you are an electrical engineer in haiti and you can make the same salary in haiti that you would make in los angeles, you still would probably rather live in los angeles, where you have a reliable-- %$* 212
we're not talking about living-- %$* 211
supply of electricity-- %$* 212
we're not talking about migration. %$* 211
good food-- %$* 212
the skilled workers don't have to migrate. %$* 211
the boeing engineers that work in different places are not migrating. %$* 211
they're working together. %$* 211
they're collaborating. %$* 211
you know-- %$* 212
but we're arguing about anywhere here. %$* 212
we're arguing-- %$* 212
but i'm talking about-- %$* 211
about geography matters. %$* 212
the same thing. %$* 211
you're looking in the past. %$* 211
you're looking 50 years in the past, when people have to physically move to do jobs. %$* 211
the jobs that all the people in this room do are high-skilled jobs. %$* 211
i don't see any laborers in this room. %$* 211
they are able to do things over the internet. %$* 211
they are able to do things over e-mail. %$* 211
they're productive over e- mail. %$* 211
they're %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
you know, they're connecting with each other-- %$* 211
to my amazement, i thought bryan caplan was-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 212
but that's not the debate we're having. %$* 212
going to be the problem here tonight. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
and i haven't heard from him in a couple minutes. %$* 13
so, bryan, jump in, please. %$* 13
and i'll come to you, ron. %$* 13
ron mentioned the declining-- %$* 210
or the stagnant wages over the last 40 years and suggested that immigrant labor supply was the problem. %$* 210
there was a much larger change in labor market over the last 40 years. %$* 210
it's called women entering labor markets. %$* 210
my question for ron-- %$* 210
so do you think that women entering the labor market was a bad thing for the economy? %$* 210
was it bad-- %$* 210
did all the gains go to capital? %$* 210
was it bad for men? %$* 210
i'd like to know. %$* 210
well, actually, the-- %$* 213
that's not why wages have declined. %$* 212
that's an interesting point. %$* 213
but i mean, when you-- %$* 213
well, it's not an interesting point-- %$* 13
but change the subject-- %$* 13
no-- %$* 213
no-- %$* 213
that's a pretty good question. %$* 13
i want to respond. %$* 213
the sort of wage sectors that have seen sharp declines are not necessarily the ones where there's been large entrance of women. %$* 213
so i tend to doubt that the entrance of a large number of women in the labor force is really the main factor involved. %$* 213
it's a complicated issue, obviously. %$* 213
yes, very complicated. %$* 210
but the bottom line is that-- %$* 213
incomes have declined. %$* 213
and it's simply due to job competition. %$* 213
now, getting back, though, to the point that there was a lot of discussion about, regarding the internet, i think it's absolutely true that it's impossible to prevent jobs from migrating over the internet, technologically. %$* 213
you can't stop that type of economic competition from overseas workers. %$* 213
i think it's also true that the wages and benefits of the sort of workers in america who are electrical engineers or software developers has been negatively impacted by foreign job competition over the internet. %$* 213
i think it's absolutely true. %$* 213
but those workers are among the best paid in the united states. %$* 213
so, the negative impact on them has been relatively mild in terms of society. %$* 213
in other words, electrical engineers right now are very well-paid. %$* 213
but if not for the internet, if not for indian job competition, they would even be much better paid. %$* 213
but they're not the people i think we have to worry about. %$* 213
we have to worry about the ordinary workers in the united states, the working class, which is, like, 60, 70, 80 percent of society. %$* 213
they are the ones whose jobs cannot be sent over the internet. %$* 213
and to exacerbate that problem by having physical job competition as well as internet job competition would, i think, make things much, much worse for that group. %$* 213
vivek wadhwa, do you concede that point? %$* 13
i conceded it. %$* 211
but the-- %$* 211
oh, we do. %$* 213
we agree? %$* 213
unskilled laborer is half of minimum wage. %$* 211
have some regulations so that people can't abused, just like we have environmental regulations, we have other-- %$* 211
so fix those regulation problems, and now let people work wherever-- %$* 211
if an employer thinks that this mexican gardener is more qualified to do this job than someone else they can hire locally, let them do it. %$* 211
why should we try to stop-- %$* 211
it becomes a much less severe problem if you have something like a much higher minimum wage. %$* 213
so let's fix regulations-- %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
let's now concede the fact-- %$* 211
we're back on minimum wage. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
okay, sure. %$* 213
let me-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
you know, we said that we wanted to play with some hypotheticals in this debate. %$* 13
we cited the european union as not a hypothetical. %$* 13
they're doing it. %$* 13
what if the united states, hypothetically, partnered with the european union, we joined them, or they joined us? %$* 13
but essentially, the rules that now let an irishman work in bulgaria would let him also work here, and an american work anywhere in europe. %$* 13
what would be your response to that, kathleen newland? %$* 13
curiously, you know, the immigration rate between european countries is about the same as the worldwide rate. %$* 212
and europe has invested enormously before they admitted spain to the european-- %$* 212
what then was the european economic community, before they admitted greece. %$* 212
they invested enormously in these countries, and they have put strict requirements on the newer entrants like bulgaria and romania so that they've created a much more level playing field. %$* 212
now, if you have-- %$* 212
a bigger labor market is a more efficient labor market, absolutely, no question about it. %$* 212
and if you fuse countries that are at pretty similar levels of income and infrastructure and human rights standards, then you probably won't have that much movement between them. %$* 212
that's been the case in europe. %$* 212
we have an agreement with canada. %$* 212
there's not that much movement between the u.s.and canada. %$* 212
but if you had an agreement between europe and morocco, or you had an agreement between the u.s.and guatemala, you would have a lot more movement. %$* 212
and i think that is where social and political and infrastructural problems arise if there isn't some control exerted over that process. %$* 212
so you're saying, yes, it could work, but you've got to pick your partners carefully. %$* 13
you've got to pick your partners carefully, or you've just got to plan and do it slowly and consciously. %$* 212
it sounds like we're agreeing. %$* 211
wait. %$* 13
vivek-- %$* 13
on the motion. %$* 211
i mean-- %$* 211
vivek, i-- %$* 13
isn't that great? %$* 211
sorry? %$* 13
not anyone anywhere. %$* 212
it sounds like we're agreeing. %$* 211
we won already, so-- %$* 211
anywhere anywhere. %$* 213
bryan caplan. %$* 13
what about that? %$* 13
any movement towards more open immigration is good for me. %$* 210
but i will say the most gains come from immigration from poor countries. %$* 210
those are where the gaps and earnings are largest. %$* 210
those are the people whose productivity is only a tiny fraction of what they could accomplish if you'd just let them go to another country. %$* 210
letting an engineer move from one country to another gives you a small gain in production. %$* 210
letting an unskilled worker move gives you an enormous increase, because they're stuck in countries where they really just can't use their skills in more than a trivial way. %$* 210
so you don't agree with the "pick your partner carefully" theory. %$* 13
i would agree. %$* 210
i would actually-- %$* 210
i would take any partner. %$* 210
i will dance with anyone, any country that-- %$* 210
any country that we want to open our borders to, i would open our borders to, absolutely. %$* 210
so we just have some regulations which prevent abuse of labor. %$* 211
we do things the american way, and we can now make the world a better place. %$* 211
we uplift the rest of humanity. %$* 211
just like in europe, you have a levelization happening, and you didn't have a mass migration of people between countries, as kathleen just said. %$* 211
so the fact is the model can work. %$* 211
we just need to have the right regulations in effect. %$* 211
but that's because the leveling happened before the opening happened. %$* 212
well, let's start leveling the world. %$* 211
why do we have-- %$* 211
why do we tolerate-- %$* 211
good idea. %$* 212
let me propose-- %$* 13
let me propose-- %$* 13
i'm going to come to questions right after this, so i just want to remind you, raise your hand, i'll call on you. %$* 13
stand up. %$* 13
wait for the microphone, please. %$* 13
if you forget, i'll just remind you. %$* 13
tell us your name, ask a question. %$* 13
really make it terse, make it a question. %$* 13
and if there's a question mark at the end of whatever you say, it works. %$* 13
let's move it away from europe. %$* 13
hypothetically, the u.s.and india make a deal. %$* 13
are we ready for that? %$* 13
is the time ready for that? %$* 13
on the skills side, it's already happening. %$* 211
vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
like i said, the free flow of knowledge is already happening. %$* 211
the fact is that they-- %$* 211
well, that, you know, i get my tax returns-- %$* 211
i have a tax accountant who really outsources the tax processes to india without telling me. %$* 211
it's happening. %$* 211
we have medical transcription happening over there. %$* 211
we have web development happening over there. %$* 211
so any happening in the world income apart, india uplifted, india became a most strategic part of the united states. %$* 211
we became more productive. %$* 211
it was win-win. %$* 211
right. %$* 13
so all this fear about the world falling apart has not happened. %$* 211
but slightly different question about letting a person move for a job. %$* 13
is india-- %$* 13
are india and the united states ripe for that? %$* 13
john, if we had the minimum salaries, there would not be a problem. %$* 211
here-- %$* 13
here or there? %$* 13
if the united states-- %$* 211
india can have its own minimum salary. %$* 211
as long as you have minimum standards for people, you can let them do a job anywhere. %$* 211
the problem happens when you can have slave labor, cheap labor, when you have haitian salaries in the united states, then everyone loses. %$* 211
so keep some decent regulations there. %$* 211
keep our social values. %$* 211
build a real middle class. %$* 211
this is the beauty of what ron has been proposing, that under his scheme, we would have a stronger middle class. %$* 211
we've lost that middle class because we have a minimum wage, which is less than it has been for, what, two or three decades, whatever the numbers are. %$* 211
exactly. %$* 213
but we all agree on the minimum wage. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i just want us to move to new ground. %$* 13
so i %$* 18
the reason why ron is arguing about billions of people coming over here is because-- %$* 211
i know, but i-- %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
he's worried that they-- %$* 211
that the salaries will go down to zero. %$* 211
but you have made-- %$* 13
you have both made that round of points twice now. %$* 13
and i'm only saying that because i want us to try to get to other topics, not to disrespect the points because they %$* 13
well, i want-- %$* 212
kathleen newland. %$* 13
i do want to respond to vivek on that. %$* 212
and i-- %$* 212
and in a way, to agree, but it's not a question of anyone being able to take a job anywhere, because this can only work under two-- %$* 212
it can only work two ways. %$* 212
it can work anarchically, which is what i've been arguing against, because that's what's implied by the proposition, is anyone anywhere. %$* 212
or it can work under highly regulated circumstances. %$* 212
sweden has a labor market policy that is anyone who is offered a job in sweden by a legitimate employer can come to sweden, do that job, live in sweden. %$* 212
sweden has a very high tax, highly regulated and high benefit society, which i think actually sound pretty %$* 212
everything, you don't have high taxes. %$* 211
you have relatively low taxes. %$* 211
you can't-- %$* 212

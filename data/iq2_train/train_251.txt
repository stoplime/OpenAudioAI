and i want to bring out to the stage the gentleman who brought intelligence squared u.s. to-- %$* 13
he is co‐founder with his wife, alexandra munroe. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz-- %$* 13
brought intelligence squared after seeing it in london to the u.s.back in 2006.we've recently passed 100 debates. %$* 13
and they're because of his vision. %$* 13
so, let's please welcome bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thanks, bob. %$* 13
and what we normally do in new york prior to the debate is we just talk for a couple of minutes, in which i'll ask bob why we're doing this debate now, why the timing. %$* 13
since i think it's in this case it's pretty obvious why we're doing it now, i'll ask you a slightly different question. %$* 13
since you've been here this week and participating in the sessions, isis has come up a lot. %$* 13
for you, what did you pick up about the situation that you feel informs you as you go into this debate? %$* 13
well, i think one thing that, to me, was very interesting-- %$* 1
i've been to three aspen strategy group sessions. %$* 1
and in this one, there was far more humility, i'd say, than in any of the others that i've been to. %$* 1
i mean, people really feel like this is an area that is not well‐understood at all and a phenomenon that is not well‐understood at all, and in a very complex context. %$* 1
one of the striking things for me was just the opening event was a lecture by bernard haykel, a professor at princeton, who kind of gave something of the historic and intellectual roots of isis. and i-- %$* 1
if i could, i'd just maybe summarize a-- %$* 1
sure. %$* 13
couple of his points. %$* 1
first of all, the term "islamic state" is exactly right. %$* 1
this is islamic. %$* 1
make no mistake. %$* 1
the administration doesn't like to use that term, but this is rooted in islam. %$* 1
and it's rooted in a very highly technical, very literalist reading of the qur'an. %$* 1
and it's an attempt to really go back to the most triumphant days of the muslim faith, which is the 7th to 9th centuries, right after the founding by the prophet. %$* 1
so they are very fundamentalist. %$* 1
they are very serious about the religion. %$* 1
and there are a couple of major tenets. %$* 1
one is sharia law. %$* 1
two is the use of armed conflict as a way of creating a full expression of a muslim society. %$* 1
the third is a notion of a caliphate, i.e., a state which is-- %$* 1
where all of the religious power and all of the political power is concentrated in one individual. %$* 1
and is is such a state. %$* 1
and it-- %$* 1
part of its appeal to people and the recruits that it gets is because of this almost utopian sense of trying to restore the past glories of islam, which, according to them, have been lost through centuries of western domination, corrupt government, and a deviation from the austerity, and the purity, and the discipline of the early religion. %$* 1
and that has a lot of appeal to people. %$* 1
so-- %$* 1
and i find it interesting. %$* 13
you say that in the panels, you found that the people we think of as experts were actually rather humble about their grasp of the situation. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 1
i mean, i think this came out of a culture that people are not familiar with. %$* 1
the tactics took people by surprise, the fast-- %$* 1
the speed in which they put together a powerful military machine took people by surprise. %$* 1
the complexity in which we're operating, with saudi arabia, with turkey, with iran, with the collapse of syria. %$* 1
i mean, there's just so many moving pieces that vary-- %$* 1
we just don't want debaters to be too humble when they get on the stage and try to defeat each other. %$* 13
i don't think that's going to be a problem. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
with that, let's thank bob rosenkranz again and welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
i just wanted to ask you, if you're not tweeting, we'd love to have you tweet. %$* 13
but otherwise we'd appreciate it if you could shut down your phones. %$* 13
i forgot, so i'm doing mine now, just because we have so many sensitive mics in the room that too many signals will wreak havoc with our microphones. %$* 13
but we're going to now officially begin our live stream. %$* 13
i believe we're up and we're going to begin the taping for the podcast and the-- %$* 13
and for the radio show. %$* 13
so i just want to ask you spontaneously to give us a round of applause. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
isis is not losing and that is the hard truth. %$* 13
this islamist movement that is stunning and revolting the world by enslaving men and women and children and cutting off the heads of hostages while gaining more followers all the time, has shocked u.s.leaders with the speed of its conquest of large portions of syria and iraq. %$* 13
and yes, the u.s. has been bombing from the air since 2014, but that is a far cry from going all in against isis. rather, to borrow a term from the cold war, the u.s. strategy comes closer to something that was known as containment, the attempt to hem in an enemy to prevent its power and influence from growing in the hope that someday it will collapse from within. %$* 13
and how much sense does that strategy make in the case of isis? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement. %$* 13
containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are in aspen, colorado, in partnership with the aspen strategy group. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters on the stage who will argue for and against this motion: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
as always, our debates will go in three rounds and then our live audience here in aspen will vote to choose the winner and only one side will win. %$* 13
our motion again: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome michèle flournoy. %$* 13
and michèle, you're co‐founder and ceo of the center for a new american security. %$* 13
you served in the department of defense during the clinton administration and then in the obama administration as under‐secretary of defense for policy. %$* 13
recently the economist was saying that a president hillary clinton would have a great first hundred days in part because your nomination as defense secretary would probably go through without much opposition. %$* 13
but, you recently coauthored an op‐ed that was critical of the obama administration's efforts to fight isis and i'm wondering do you think the obama administration has heard you? %$* 13
well, i certainly hope so, but to be fair, you know, the administration has a lot on its plate right now. %$* 664
this little thing called the iran deal, getting that through congress, concluding an historic trade deal in asia, but i'm confident that once those two things are taken care of this will move to the top of the president's nightstand reading pile. %$* 664
and keep him up all night. %$* 13
yes. %$* 664
thank you very much, michèle flournoy. %$* 13
can you tell us, michèle, who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is the brilliant philip zelikow. %$* 664
philip zelikow, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, philip, you are also arguing for the motion that containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
you're a professor of history at the university of virginia and you have served as a counselor to the state department and as director of the 9/11 commission. %$* 13
you've also served on the president's intelligence advisory board for both presidents bush and obama, which might strike some listeners as odd, because we really want to know, is it common for somebody to advise presidents of different parties? %$* 13
i'm afraid, john, it's not common enough, which is a shame, because i think presidents need all the help that they can get. %$* 665
well, i think a lot of people in this room have helped some of them out, actually, along the way, so they'll be listening closely. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for the motion that containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and now let's meet the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
anne‐marie, you are president and ceo of the think tank new america and professor emerita of politics and international affairs at princeton. %$* 13
you are the first woman to hold the position of director of policy planning for the u.s.state department. %$* 13
you've also served as dean of princeton's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs and we're curious whether your affiliation with the school named for woodrow wilson gives us a hint to your brand of state craft. %$* 13
well, it does, but it is coincidental and that even before i was dean i've always stood for a values‐based foreign policy on the grounds that when the united states acts as consistently as possible with our values, it advances our national interest and it augments our power. %$* 666
which i'm sure will inform your arguments today. %$* 13
and please tell us who is your partner. %$* 13
the foreign policy analyst extraordinaire, dov %$* 666
zakheim. %$* 666
ladies and gentlemen, the unforgettable dov zakheim. %$* 13
dov-- %$* 13
it shows you how well we prepared. %$* 667
you are also arguing against the motion that containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
not anymore. %$* 667
in our three against one debate tonight,-- %$* 13
you're senior advisor at the center for strategic and international studies and a senior fellow at cnn-- %$* 13
cna corporation. %$* 13
i said cnn, but i meant cna corporation. %$* 13
you've served the department of defense in different capacities. %$* 13
you were its coordinator for civilian programs in afghanistan. %$* 13
you were the chief financial officer and an under‐ secretary of defense. %$* 13
you are also a vulcan, which is not in the star trek sense. %$* 13
can you explain what a vulcan is? %$* 13
yeah, there were seven of us, not including mr. %$* 667
spock, who advised george w.bush when he was running for president. %$* 667
of course, some people would say it would've help if spock advised him, but the group was actually set up by condi rice, who is no stranger to aspen, and it was named after the statue of the god vulcan in birmingham. %$* 667
and since we had no say in it, we became vulcans. %$* 667
it's better than a star trek story, actually. %$* 13
thank you very much, dov zakheim. %$* 13
and welcome to the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a contest of ideas and logic and persuasion, maybe a little wit and humor, but at bottom the debaters here are trying to get our live audience here in aspen to vote with them. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended this audience will have been asked to vote two times, once before the arguments and once again after the arguments, and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms between the two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's have our preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, just pay attention to keys number one, two, and three. %$* 13
the others are not live. %$* 13
it works like this. %$* 13
if you're for the motion and i'm going to state it, and listen carefully, because there's a negative in it, but you really want to be listening probably to the back end of it. %$* 13
containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
if you agree with that push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided push number three. %$* 13
and we'll give that about 15 seconds and then lock it out. %$* 13
at the end of the debate we'll do the same thing again and we get the results in about 45 seconds to a minute. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
let's begin. %$* 13
let's move on to round one. %$* 13
onto round one, opening statements from each debater in turn, uninterrupted. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each. %$* 13
speaking first for the motion containment is not enough: isis must be defeated, michèle flournoy. %$* 13
she is co‐founder and ceo of the center for a new american security and former under‐secretary of defense for policy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michèle flournoy. %$* 13
so i'm arguing for the proposition that isis must be defeated. %$* 664
isis is more than a terrorist organization. %$* 664
it is a proto‐state, an ideological movement that is committed to undertake jihad against anyone who rejects its abhorrent ideology. %$* 664
its ultimate aim is to establish a territorial caliphate that stretches across the muslim world. %$* 664
isis is brutal in the extreme. %$* 664
it has beheaded innocent civilians. %$* 664
it has burned a captured jordanian pilot alive in a cage. %$* 664
it rapes women and girls and sells them into sexual slavery. %$* 664
it crucifies christians. %$* 664
it desecrates and destroys holy sites and antiquities. %$* 664
over the last year isis has established a very substantial safe haven in iraq and syria, and it has recruited more than 22,000 foreign fighters from more than 100 countries. %$* 664
the scale and scope of this mobilization is unprecedented. %$* 664
thousands of these fighters have western passports that would allow them to travel back to europe and to the united states without a visa. %$* 664
isis-- %$* 664
its geographic ambitions are not limited to the middle east. %$* 664
this is a globalizing movement. %$* 664
in the last year isis has sought to establish footprints in places from libya to afghanistan, nigeria, the caucasus, even southeast asia. %$* 664
holding territory is critical to its momentum and its legitimacy. %$* 664
it has also established a global presence on the internet using online means to disseminate its propaganda, recruit and radicalize followers, inspire lone‐wolf attacks. %$* 664
again, the scale is eye‐watering. %$* 664
90,000 social media messages each day. %$* 664
90,000 a day. %$* 664
in some ways, isis could become more dangerous than al‐qaeda. %$* 664
al‐ qaeda used to assert very strict control over who became an affiliate. %$* 664
isis says, "let a thousand flowers bloom. %$* 664
if we can inspire individuals to conduct attacks around the world, that's great.” in fact, 10 of the 11 attacks conducted in the west since may of 2014 have been by lone wolves. %$* 664
isis has also conducted attacks not only in the middle east, but in canada, australia, france, denmark, and yes, here in the united states. %$* 664
in all 50 states today, there are active investigations or arrests of isis. if ever there was a terrorist group that we must defeat, it is isis. now, defeating isis will require an intensive-- %$* 664
more intensive and fully resourced campaign on the part of the united states and our international partners. %$* 664
we need to intensify our diplomacy and our military support to sunni and other partners so that they can be empowered to defeat isis on the ground. %$* 664
politically, that means we need intensified diplomacy to press the shi'a government in baghdad, to address sunni grievances, to devolve more authorities and resources to the provinces, to move towards a more federal and just iraq. %$* 664
in syria, we need a more robust diplomatic effort to set the conditions for what should eventually become a negotiated settlement that removes assad from power. %$* 664
we need increased international engagement to try to keep the civil war in syria from destabilizing neighboring states, like jordan, and lebanon, and turkey. %$* 664
militarily, in iraq we need to provide more support, trainers, combat advisers, equipment, close air support, to local partners on the ground who can take on isis and take back territory. %$* 664
to be clear, i am not-- %$* 664
we are not arguing for a large‐scale u.s.military invasion of iraq. %$* 664
we are not calling for a repeat of the iraq war. %$* 664
we are calling for intensified support to partners. %$* 664
in syria-- %$* 664
we need to shift our emphasis to producing more support to some of the groups that are already having success on the ground, like the southern front and the syrian free army. %$* 664
we also need to refashion our train and equip program to try to get towards the goal of a more viable alternative to isis in a post‐assad syria. %$* 664
thinking globally, we also need to combat isis using the full range of tools that we've developed for counterterrorism, disrupting their financing, targeting their leadership, building their capacity of partners in other countries to try to keep isis from moving in. %$* 664
we need to work with private sector and ngo partners to combat them online. %$* 664
and we need to address some more fundamental conditions that create fertile soil for isis, such as poor governance and community grievance. %$* 664
this will not be without risk. %$* 664
but i would argue, the risk of inaction are even greater. %$* 664
the other team will argue that containment is a better option. %$* 664
i will tell you that containment won't work. %$* 664
containment means allowing isis to hold on to sanctuary. %$* 664
it means isis will be able to continue to plan attacks, recruit followers, inspire lone wolves. %$* 664
containment would be a recipe for endless terrorist attacks in the west and instability in the middle east. %$* 664
is that a future we really want? %$* 664
it's not a future i want my children to live in. %$* 664
if there's anything we should have learned from 9/11, it is that we must not allow a terrorist organization like this to have sanctuary in the heart of the middle east or elsewhere. %$* 664
now is the time to do more, to act with our partners, to defeat isis. thank you. %$* 664
thank you, michèle flournoy. %$* 13
and the motion is: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and our next debater will be speaking against that motion, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
she is president and ceo of new america and former director of policy planning for the u.s.department of state. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
so, i want to see the end of isis as much as anyone does. %$* 666
no one can watch the horrible things they do and not think that this is a terrible, terrible scourge and threat. %$* 666
and we have to end it. %$* 666
the question on the table is, "what is the best strategy to achieve that goal for the united states? %$* 666
" that's what we're debating. %$* 666
what is the best strategy for us? %$* 666
now, our opponents are already fudging that question. %$* 666
because the debate here is, do you use military force to drive them out of the territory they hold or do you contain them where they are? %$* 666
and so, what you're hearing is they can't have sanctuary. %$* 666
michèle flournoy said very clearly-- %$* 666
they cannot have a sanctuary. %$* 666
okay? %$* 666
what they have to convince you of is they have a strategy for how the united states can deny them-- %$* 666
can deny isis-- %$* 666
that strategy. %$* 666
so, let's just be very clear about what's on the table here. %$* 666
they have to convince you they have a strategy for the united states to drive isis out of that sanctuary, and somehow magically, without boots on the ground. %$* 666
but i'll leave that to them. %$* 666
so, they have to tell you what defeat is and how the u.s.can achieve it. %$* 666
here's what we mean by containment. %$* 666
we mean stopping isis where it is. %$* 666
we mean critically breaking their narrative of victory. %$* 666
we all heard from professor haykel, who bob rosenkranz mentioned. %$* 666
he said, "look, what is essential is that every time isis wins, they convince their supporters god is on their side."all right. %$* 666
it is a kind of end‐of‐days, millenarian-- %$* 666
"this is it. %$* 666
we're going to restore the caliphate. %$* 666
we're going to spread it across the world. %$* 666
and see, god is on our side because we have just taken another city." so, containment says you break that. %$* 666
you do not let them expand their territory and you do everything you can to stop the flow of recruits. %$* 666
so you stop them where they are. %$* 666
so, that's containment. %$* 666
it's not a do‐nothing strategy. %$* 666
in fact, it's doing everything possible, and certainly, diplomatically everything possible. %$* 666
digitally everything possible. %$* 666
in-- %$* 666
and militarily, stopping them from expanding where they are. %$* 666
it may also mean supporting our allies and friends in the middle east to the extent they take the lead in wanting to push isis back. %$* 666
so that's containment. %$* 666
we're going to stop them where they are. %$* 666
we're going to let their internal contradictions show themselves. %$* 666
we're going to let ultimately, as we have done before, for the older members of this audience-- %$* 666
we're going to let the ideology crumble itself. %$* 666
the alternative is roll‐back. %$* 666
right? %$* 666
the alternative, as i said, is going in there and actually pushing them out of that territory. %$* 666
and i'm going to leave it to my partner, dov zakheim-- %$* 666
the brilliant dov zakheim. %$* 666
he's going to talk about why that's so hard militarily. %$* 666
but what i want to do is talk about why that won't work, why roll‐back won't work politically. %$* 666
and the first thing to say is we've seen this movie before. %$* 666
general petraeus was on the stage two days ago, talking about how he had pushed al‐qaeda in iraq out of mosul. %$* 666
al‐qaeda in iraq is not there, but guess who's back in mosul? %$* 666
isis is there. %$* 666
this is round 2.we have done this militarily before. %$* 666
that didn't work. %$* 666
and here's why, because it isn't just an idea. %$* 666
it is not just a military question. %$* 666
isis is an ideology. %$* 666
professor haykel said on the same stage that, of course, defeat is desirable. %$* 666
but how do you defeat a set of ideas? %$* 666
so, the way we've done this before, when we were up against an ideology-- %$* 666
for most of my life, that ideology was communism. %$* 666
containment was the most successful strategy the united states has ever pursued. %$* 666
and it didn't mean not doing anything. %$* 666
and we had to use our military. %$* 666
and we used our-- %$* 666
diplomatically. %$* 666
but we contained the soviet union and ultimately, we let its internal contradictions destroy it. %$* 666
so, it's happened before. %$* 666
and it'll come again. %$* 666
equally-- %$* 666
or more troubling is that if we inject ourselves, we confirm their narrative. %$* 666
right? %$* 666
isis's narrative is that they are fighting the crusaders-- %$* 666
that's us-- %$* 666
the zionists-- %$* 666
that's the israelis-- %$* 666
and the shiites and the sufis. %$* 666
so, the minute we put ourselves in there, we are confirming to them and everyone they want to recruit that this is indeed the millennial battle between the crusaders and the true defenders of islam. %$* 666
we don't want to do that. %$* 666
the last reason that we need to pursue a containment strategy is this is a very long game. %$* 666
so, general petraeus said two days ago-- %$* 666
and he was quoting general odierno-- %$* 666
that this was a fight at least of a decade, if not a decade or two decades. %$* 666
so, 10 to 20 years. %$* 666
that's what are our generals are telling us now. %$* 666
that actually, i think, could be on the short side. %$* 666
so, remember your history and remember stories of monotheistic faith in which clerics had both political and religious power and were deeply, deeply corrupt and spawned a revolt that said you had to purify the church and ultimately that was the only way to reclaim the true religion. %$* 666
obviously that's the reformation. %$* 666
it was just decades, it was centuries. %$* 666
this is a deeply internal muslim fight. %$* 666
it is a fight for the soul of islam. %$* 666
it is not our fight. %$* 666
it is the muslim's fight. %$* 666
in the end we have to protect ourselves. %$* 666
we have to contain it, but we cannot win it. %$* 666
thank you. %$* 666
thank you, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 666
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm jon donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing it out over this motion: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
you've heard the first two opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating for the motion containment is not enough: isis must be defeated, philip zelikow. %$* 13
he is the white burkett miller professor of history at the university of virginia and served as the director of the 9/11 commission. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, philip zelikow. %$* 13
tough issue, but i want to start where anne‐marie slaughter left off. %$* 665
she said injecting the united states into this conflict confirms their narrative. %$* 665
as if we're not injected already? %$* 665
as if we're not conducting air strikes against them every single day? %$* 665
as if we're not, as the deputy secretary of state has said, "we've already killed 10,000 of their members, but it has not declined." in other words, we're already injected. %$* 665
we're already fighting, we're just not beating them. %$* 665
that confirms their narrative. %$* 665
that confirms their narrative of victory. %$* 665
their crusaders attack us every day. %$* 665
that's the way they put it. %$* 665
and here we are controlling 20 cities, ruling millions of people, and enslaving more. %$* 665
let's talk about what failure looks like. %$* 665
sure, failure looks like hundreds or thousands of americans dead after an attack that could come next month, next year, or the year after that. %$* 665
the 9/11 attack that i studied gestated for three years before they laid waste to southern manhattan. %$* 665
the people who carried out that attack migrated from germany to afghanistan nearly two years before the attack. %$* 665
they went there, by the way, thinking that they were going to go fight russians in chechnya, but the leadership found other uses for them. %$* 665
so failure looks like hundreds or thousands of americans dead with more violence in europe, but failure also looks like the descent of the middle east into the full war of extremes in which its all against all, in which its shia extremists supported by iran and sunni extremists for whom isis is the terrifying sort of purity and lebanon crumples and jordan crumples and turkey begins to crumple, all already awash with millions of displaced people. %$* 665
all are already failing to cope. %$* 665
their societies already sagging under the weight of the burdens. %$* 665
saudi arabia destabilized as more and more sunnis find that that's really the extreme version of their own ideology that they want to follow. %$* 665
don't you think that that's the point that the u.s. has to reinvade the middle east? %$* 665
that's failure. %$* 665
u.s.reinvasion of the middle east is failure. %$* 665
that's the failure michèle flournoy and i are against. %$* 665
that's why you need to adopt this resolution and defeat isis so that we don’t have to reinvade the middle east. %$* 665
what then does success look like? %$* 665
success looks like defeating their message. %$* 665
what's their message? %$* 665
it's a message about power. %$* 665
we empower the weak sunni muslims and we empower them through the exclusive divine mission they hold and the terrifying sword they wield in the territory we rule, ruling despite the crusader's attacks against us. %$* 665
so what does success look like? %$* 665
it's sunni muslims liberating their own lands. %$* 665
it's sunni muslims recovering self‐determination. %$* 665
so what's the strategy to do that? %$* 665
it's a political strategy first and foremost, because the public debate in america is mostly about should we do more militarily. %$* 665
that's wrong. %$* 665
michèle and i both believe, know the strategy leads politically and it needs to be a strategy that appeals to sunni muslims, because they're the ones we want to do most of the fighting to keep americans from having to do most of the fighting later on. %$* 665
why will they fight? %$* 665
they will fight to free themselves, to free themselves from the assad tyranny in syria where we also must join that fight and end the syrian civil war, which is destroying the region and bringing it close to the brink of apocalypse. %$* 665
that's the kind of message that appeals to turkey and brings them in on our side and units saudi arabia and the sunnis of lebanon and the millions of syrians in refugee camps who want to return to their homes. %$* 665
because, you see, isis is not homegrown. %$* 665
isis are foreigners. %$* 665
the isis rulers in syria are led by iraqis and veterans of saddam hussein's gestapo and they recruit uzbeks and chechens to run their shock troops in mosul. %$* 665
many of the iraqi recruits that they enslave into their service don't even understand the command language that they're hearing on the radio. %$* 665
so the political strategy is a self‐determination of sunni muslims. %$* 665
and the military strategy, advise and support so they can do the job, but it's a tough job. %$* 665
they have to retake cities. %$* 665
to do that kind of urban warfare requires just the kind of assets that only the united states has. %$* 665
think about urban combat and what you need, armored vehicles that aren't going to be blown up by an ied as easily, jammers to diffuse the ieds, snipers who can provide over watch, communication so that you know what's going on in the block two blocks away from you, medivac capabilities that give you the confidence your wounded can be treated and helicopters and fires that can be brought to bear on the targets you see in front of you. %$* 665
those are assets only the united states can provide, which gives them the confidence and the sense that we're in this with them that allows you to build a coalition founded on sunni muslims doing the job to liberate their own lands, because containment doesn't keep the u.s.out. %$* 665
it guarantees the u.s.is likely to come in. %$* 665
anne‐marie said it at last. %$* 665
let ideology crumble itself. %$* 665
did the khmer rouge crumble itself? %$* 665
no, the vietnamese had to invade cambodia. %$* 665
did the taliban crumble itself? %$* 665
did al‐qaeda in pakistan crumble itself? %$* 665
has the north korean tyranny crumbled itself? %$* 665
no. %$* 665
you have to beat terror with something else and in this case the something else is defeating terror where it has taken root in isis. support the resolution. %$* 665
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, philip zelikow. %$* 13
and the motion is containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and here to make his opening statement against the motion and our final speaker in the opening round, dov zakheim. %$* 13
he is the senior advisor at the center for strategic and international studies and former under‐secretary of defense. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dov zakheim. %$* 13
thanks very much and i really want to thank phil, because he just made my argument. %$* 667
we have armed isis. what do you think they're using? %$* 667
american personnel carriers. %$* 667
american tanks. %$* 667
american ammunition. %$* 667
why? %$* 667
because we've done such a fantastic job training the iraqis and we've been doing it for over a decade, and we've done an equally good job training the afghans. %$* 667
that's why they're doing so well. %$* 667
and in fact, if you look at who we've trained in syria, we have a $500 million program that thus far has spat out 60 fighters, 60.that's less than that side of the room. %$* 667
of which, and i hope this doesn't happen to any of you all, a whole bunch have already been captured. %$* 667
so let's step back and look at what it really takes to beat these folks and to do something other than to contain them the way my brilliant colleague, anne‐marie slaughter-- %$* 667
laid out for you. %$* 667
you know, this isn't the first outburst of islamic extremism. %$* 667
for instance, in the 12th century there was a fanatical group that actually had the same ideology as these guys called the almohads. %$* 667
and how were they defeated? %$* 667
by massive forces of christian troops coming down from northern spain. %$* 667
in the 18th century, the original wahhabis who had made a deal with the first basically same kind of ideology. %$* 667
they were defeated by turkish forces, and then we had the same sort of thing again in the late 19th century when lord kitchener, then general kitchener, amassed a huge force to defeat the mahdi in sudan. %$* 667
what's the common denominator? %$* 667
lots of troops. %$* 667
not a few thousand. %$* 667
not a bunch of spotters, because oh, by the way, when the israelis couldn't beat hezbollah in 2006, they didn't have a problem with spotters. %$* 667
and when we tried to bomb vietnam to the stone age in the 1960s, with rolling thunder, we didn't have a problem with spotters. %$* 667
spotters aren't the issue. %$* 667
the issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? %$* 667
do you think this country wants to do that? %$* 667
do you think we even want to spend the money to do that? %$* 667
we're living under a strange thing called a sequester. %$* 667
somebody was asked on television, "what's a sequester? %$* 667
" and he answered, "it's the capital of portugal." people don't even know what a sequester is. %$* 667
but what it's done is limit our spending. %$* 667
and you talk to secretary of defense carter and he rightly says he's being constrained all over the place. %$* 667
the president says it. %$* 667
so, where are we going to find the money-- %$* 667
even if we had the will, which i don't think we have-- %$* 667
to go and fund all these troops, or even to do what philip says. %$* 667
all the things you want to give these folks-- %$* 667
let's assume they don't fall into isis's hands. %$* 667
where are we going to find the money for it? %$* 667
do we have the will? %$* 667
do we have the money? %$* 667
do we have the staying power for that kind of thing? %$* 667
the only way you're going to stop these guys is if, indeed, they rot from within. %$* 667
that's the only alternative if you're not going to send hundreds of thousands of troops in. %$* 667
and to get them to rot from within, you have to contain them. %$* 667
you've got to keep them cooped up. %$* 667
and there are ways to do that. %$* 667
but we're not even in one mind as to how to right now. %$* 667
yes, we love the kurds, but we don't arm them. %$* 667
yes, we want to work with the turks, except the turks have a different agenda. %$* 667
they want to bomb the kurds, who we like. %$* 667
i mean, you need a scorecard to figure out who exactly is on your side. %$* 667
how do you beat these people that way? %$* 667
the bottom line is-- %$* 667
unless we have a coherent major military strategy, the real alternative-- %$* 667
when you parse out all the stuff about what we can do right now, the real alternative is to keep them cooped up, to arm our friends, to figure out how to train those who will fight. %$* 667
and yes, the sunnis might fight. %$* 667
but guess what? %$* 667
they haven't fought until now. %$* 667
we've been begging them for years. %$* 667
saudi arabia is fighting, except not in syria, not in iraq. %$* 667
they're fighting in yemen. %$* 667
and they're not doing that hot a job there either. %$* 667
so, we have to figure out how to motivate those we want to work with us. %$* 667
and that's going to take time. %$* 667
and what do we do in the meantime? %$* 667
we've got to contain isis for as long as possible. %$* 667
and if we could beat the soviet union, i wouldn't bet the family farm against our beating isis. %$* 667
thank you. %$* 667
thank you, dov zakheim. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
remember how you voted in the opening voting rounds, and we're going to have you vote again after the third round of the debate. %$* 13
and again, reminding you that the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round 2.round 2 is where the debaters take questions from me, address one another directly, and take questions from you in our live audience here in aspen. %$* 13
the motion is this: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
we've heard one team arguing for the motion, michèle flournoy and philip zelikow, arguing that isis is not al‐qaeda. %$* 13
isis is no minor league organization-- %$* 13
that containment would be a recipe for endless terrorist attacks, that success would be supporting muslim groups inside the isis realm, who would themselves take on the battle of defeating isis. %$* 13
and success would be the furthering of that effort with u.s.support, but not, they emphasize, with hundreds of thousands of u.s.boots on the ground. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, anne‐marie slaughter and dov zakheim, they are arguing that containment-- %$* 13
by that, they mean stopping isis where it is, but they don't mean a roll‐ back. %$* 13
they charge their opponents with needing to defend roll‐back. %$* 13
that's what this debate is actually about. %$* 13
they say that containment is not doing nothing. %$* 13
but at the same time, if the united states were to get involved, it would strengthen isis's recruiting efforts, that every time we kill somebody in isis, it brings somebody new, and that it is naïve to argue that defeat cannot happen without bringing hundreds of thousands of troops onto the ground, that you cannot count on local forces to do that. %$* 13
i'm actually seeing a confusing amount of overlap between the two sides, in terms of the means that you would use to put your particular visions into play. %$* 13
you're both talking about-- %$* 13
you're both talking about small numbers of troops to support. %$* 13
definitely you would contain and stop. %$* 13
you would contain and, to some degree, move on. %$* 13
but i am somewhat confused by the team arguing for the motion, saying, "we don't want to put troops on the ground." your opponents say, "well, how else are you going to roll‐back? %$* 13

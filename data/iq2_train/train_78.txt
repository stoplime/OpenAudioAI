if-- %$* 13
what policy prescription are you actually suggesting and what's the outcome of that prescription, if you can predict? %$* 13
graham allison. %$* 13
absolutely great question. %$* 283
i would say that our hope would be-- %$* 283
and the best hope-- %$* 283
but it's a stretch-- %$* 283
but the best hope is a situation in which the combination of humanitarian assistance to the victims and close working with the neighbors in the region and a strategic concept of a government that could exist after a transition leads to a negotiation in which there's an extended transition of power. %$* 283
and i would say that's a stretch. %$* 283
that's a distant hope. %$* 283
but the alternatives to that-- %$* 283
if i looked at them-- %$* 283
are worse. %$* 283
on this side? %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
i don't think our recipe is fundamentally different. %$* 285
it's the same. %$* 285
i think our view is that that has to be approached more urgently. %$* 285
and we need to put more tools on the table, get more involved short of being sucked into boots on the ground and real military action. %$* 285
and the worry i have is that it gets much more difficult to see that political transition ending in a reasonable representative syrian government the longer this goes on. %$* 285
and the problem is that we've waited a long time. %$* 285
the extremists have the upper hand. %$* 285
and what you're saying, i think, is that we just have to accept that al-qaeda and hezbollah should slug it out. %$* 285
we say no. %$* 285
there remains a distinct and credible moderate force within syria that we have to support and get to the point where they can make their own decision. %$* 285
one more-- %$* 283
yes. %$* 13
graham allison. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
allison. %$* 13
i-- %$* 283
i mean i think nigel is speaking directly to the point. %$* 283
but i would have to-- %$* 283
fareed zakaria who has been struggling with this a lot-- %$* 283
had a good line recently. %$* 283
and i wonder if you disagree. %$* 283
he says, quote, “we want an outcome in syria that's even more ambitious than the one we sought in iraq. %$* 283
and yet, we imagine that we can get it by a no-fly zone or even less than that.” so, do you disagree with that? %$* 283
i don't disagree fundamentally. %$* 285
but i'm just looking at the other comparable examples. %$* 285
and my comparable examples will be not ones very appealing to this audience or to a british audience in terms of what we'd want politically. %$* 285
but i look at tunisia. %$* 285
i look at egypt. %$* 285
i look at libya. %$* 285
i see all the reasons why it would have been very convenient to keep the old regimes in power, but i don't see al-qaeda in charge in any of those places. %$* 285
and i don't see why that needs to be the case in syria either. %$* 285
we’ll hear from richard and then-- %$* 13
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
a lot hangs on your assessment of the character of the syrian state. %$* 119
and one of the key differences between tunisia and egypt, lesser extent libya, is the sectarian division in syria is far worse. %$* 119
and so the speed with which the protest took off and the violence took off was not merely a moderate bourgeois rebellion against an autocrat. %$* 119
it was the emergence of a sectarian conflict which has been suppressed by force by the alawites, a shi’ite sect, for years, at least going back to 1970, and where the only other active political entity, the muslim brotherhood, was destroyed viciously by assad in hama. %$* 119
so, i mean, to say that-- %$* 119
to hang so much on the idea that a moderate syrian secular leadership and consensus will emerge, as graham says, that's-- %$* 119
we didn't even develop that in iraq. %$* 119
nick burns. %$* 13
i think that-- %$* 284
i think that graham asked a fair question, and fareed's a smart guy. %$* 284
the difference between the u.s.intervening and iraq in march 2003 and what we're talking about now is that the syrian moderates have a lot more support, frankly, than the united states did going into iraq. %$* 284
if you look at turkey's support, and the support of all the gulf countries, nearly every other arab country, all of europe, and the united states, and canada, i think that's probably the best way for this loose international coalition to succeed eventually in helping the syrian rebels to stay together and to draw on that international unity. %$* 284
and remember the question here is not whether we have a vital interest, not whether we're going to intervene militarily, we're not going to do that, do we care who wins, and do we put our shoulder behind that side, that's what president obama's said he wants to do. %$* 284
and i find that logical. %$* 284
right in the center. %$* 13
lindsay hanahan hi. %$* 13
my name's lindsay hanahan and i'm desperate for some hope here. %$* 13
so we have a new leader in iran. %$* 13
and i'm hearing this conversation about the proxy fight. %$* 13
does the fact that we have a new leader in iran give us some possibility he's come up and said that he is willing to reach out? %$* 13
can you rephrase your question, and i know that you can, that relates it to what-- %$* 13
kind of what the american interest in being involved is? %$* 13
lindsay hanahan if we're looking at do we or do we not have a dog in the fight, and part of that hinges on who that dog is that we're fighting as well, i believe, so i'm saying if who we're fighting changes in terms of this proxy, do we now have a dog in the fight if iran pulls out and-- %$* 13
and who's on the other side? %$* 13
lindsay hanahan who's on the other side-- %$* 13
right, okay. %$* 13
lindsay hanahan-- %$* 13
changes. %$* 13
great, actually really well skillfully done, thank you. %$* 13
who'd like to take that side first? %$* 13
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
i'm arguing the u.s.has no dog in the fight. %$* 119
i don't have a crystal ball but i doubt it. %$* 119
i doubt that the new elected president controls it. %$* 119
it's a longstanding-- %$* 119
i mean, syria is iran's last friend in the region. %$* 119
their support for hezbollah goes back to 1982.syria's the funnel through which the arms get to hezbollah. %$* 119
and the new president is not, in fact, the supreme leader. %$* 119
the supreme leader is the supreme leader. %$* 119
and so this policy seems pretty well marbled in the iranian state, and i doubt it will change of its own accord just because of an election. %$* 119
the other side, nick burns? %$* 13
i think it's a really good question. %$* 284
and i don't disagree with richard. %$* 284
i think he's probably right. %$* 284
but there is a-- %$* 284
possibly an opportunity here. %$* 284
rouhani was inaugurated last sunday. %$* 284
he's a different guy than jalili, the former nuclear negotiator. %$* 284
the europeans found him to be more pragmatic and straightforward when they dealt with him a couple of years ago. %$* 284
so we've been talking this week at aspen. %$* 284
how should the u.s. approach him on this subject of syria on the nuclear question? %$* 284
we ought to give negotiations a chance. %$* 284
we haven't had a serious negotiation with iran and sustained since the jimmy carter administration. %$* 284
so we ought to open up a conversation. %$* 284
we may not be able-- %$* 284
probably won't-- %$* 284
i think richard's right-- %$* 284
change their minds, but let's put syria on the table, and let's let the iranians know that this is a big deal for us, and for israel, and for europe, and see if we can make some progress there. %$* 284
it's at least worth a try. %$* 284
that was a great question. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and, sir, over here, and i think you might be our last question. %$* 13
jenna, do we have more time after this, or we need to-- %$* 13
arly sherman my name is arly sherman as i recall, since i think i'm older than most of this group, that harry truman said that it was not in our special interests to defend the korean peninsula or the straits of formosa. %$* 13
and it was a green light for the russians, the chinese, and everyone to move. %$* 13
are we not giving a green light now for iran to move and are moving and doing the same thing that harry truman did? %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
well, that's our worry. %$* 285
i mean, that's one of our concerns over this continued stalemate. %$* 285
letting assad stay in power is de facto-- %$* 285
it's a victory for iran. %$* 285
it extends further their influence because they have thousands of their own people now in syria in a way that they weren't a short while ago. %$* 285
and i think that, although i too agree that there's going to be-- %$* 285
very unlikely to be an immediate change on the rouhani’s part, nevertheless, we want to create uncertainty in their minds. %$* 285
and the uncertainty that assad may go and that something different may emerge in syria. %$* 285
i think it's a good thing in trying to get them to negotiate seriously with us on the other issues. %$* 285
and graham allison. %$* 13
well, i would say in one word, no, okay? %$* 283
the situations are entirely different. %$* 283
there are numerous places in the world where the u.s. does have vital interests. %$* 283
there usually we have an alliance. %$* 283
for example, israel we regard as an ally. %$* 283
if there's an attack on an ally we think this reaches the level of a threat to our vital interest, and for those we are prepared to act. %$* 283
there are many, many other situations in the world in which we're not prepared to act. %$* 283
that doesn't mean that on some occasions we don't. %$* 283
north korea is a good example. %$* 283
but it seems to me that we went around everywhere saying to everyone if something bad happens in somalia we're going to become involved militarily. %$* 283
if something happens in sudan we're going to become involved militarily. %$* 283
if something happens in pakistan, where there's an even bigger war right-- %$* 283
we're going to become militarily involved. %$* 283
we will soon find the u.s. everywhere. %$* 283
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
those closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted just before the debate, immediately after these statements we will have you vote again. %$* 13
so, this is their last chance to try to win over your votes. %$* 13
our motion is this: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
round three, closing statements, here to speak first against the motion, nicholas, you do the-- %$* 13
seated for the closing statements-- %$* 13
to speak against the motion, nicholas burns. %$* 13
he is professor at the harvard kennedy school and former undersecretary of state for political affairs. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 284
and i've really enjoyed this debate. %$* 284
thanks to richard and graham. %$* 284
eighteen years ago at the height of the bosnian war in 1995, i found myself a state department spokesperson and my job basically was to give daily press conferences and defend the clinton administration's foreign policy. %$* 284
one of the toughest and most painful moments of my entire career came in july of that year when the bosnian serb military went through a dutch u.n.garrison outside the city of srebrenica. %$* 284
they went into the town. %$* 284
they rounded up-- %$* 284
well, they divided the men and the women. %$* 284
they rounded up 8,000 men and boys and they shot them. %$* 284
it was the worst massacre in the world since the nazis massacred european jewry. %$* 284
and i had to explain the following days, as did my white house colleague, mike mccurry, why didn't the united states act? %$* 284
why weren't we involved? %$* 284
why hadn't we made sure that the united nations had a tougher mission in bosnia? %$* 284
and a lot of us in the clinton administration at that time vowed that we would never again stand by with all the power of the united states and our leadership and let something like that happen. %$* 284
now we can't be everywhere. %$* 284
graham's right. %$* 284
we can't solve the world's problems. %$* 284
we're not the world's policemen. %$* 284
we can't intervene everywhere. %$* 284
but at least we can try without putting military forces in, to help the people of syria. %$* 284
the people who are supporting the rebel groups are the majority in syria. %$* 284
they deserve a chance. %$* 284
and the approach that nigel and i outlined is far better than doing nothing, because if we say we have no dog in the fight, we consign the syrian people to the brutalization of the assad government. %$* 284
we do have a dog in the fight. %$* 284
it's to lead by moral example, to do what we can to help those people survive. %$* 284
and it may be two, three, or four years before they're able to get on their feet, form a new government and kick assad out, but we need to stay the course with them. %$* 284
thank you very much. %$* 284
thank you. %$* 13
nicholas burns. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s. has no dog in the fight in syria and here to speak in support of the motion, it means he thinks the u.s. has no dog in this fight, richard falkenrath, a principle with the chertoff group and former deputy homeland security advisor. %$* 13
so, if we interpret this motion as do we care, there's no difference between the two panels. %$* 119
we do. %$* 119
i think graham, i, nick, nigel, we equally abhor this violence, and if we could stop this butchery we can, we would. %$* 119
but the proposition before us is what to do about it. %$* 119
and here, i think you've heard slightly different prescriptions from nick and nigel and i'm going to choose to focus on the one i heard from nigel, which i think is correct, that a political outcome in syria requires changing facts on the ground. %$* 119
in order to change the facts on the ground you need to tilt the military balance against assad in some way or another. %$* 119
that is what we call a proxy war. %$* 119
i have no objection-- %$* 119
on a principle basis-- %$* 119
to proxy warfare. %$* 119
but i do, on a pragmatic basis, which is if we are going to get into them, we should have a reasonable belief that we can succeed. %$* 119
and that, unfortunately, is not the case here. %$* 119
and it's not the case for several different reasons, one of which is our proxy is not very reliable, and in fact, not very powerful, this moderate opposition. %$* 119
another is the opponent is deeply entrenched and their own sponsors-- %$* 119
hezbollah, iran, russia-- %$* 119
are completely uninhibited by the strength that we have. %$* 119
russia is sending advanced anti-aircraft systems to syria right now. %$* 119
there-- %$* 119
and apparently lawful under international law. %$* 119
and we can't even-- %$* 119
we struggle over whether to send light arms. %$* 119
so i think the other side, though they wish to avoid saying we're for military intervention-- %$* 119
in fact, the essence of their political strategy requires a change of the military facts on the ground. %$* 119
and that involves giving military support to the fighters. %$* 119
that is that we call a proxy war. %$* 119
and unless you are very, very sure that you will prevail in the end, it strikes me as an unwise policy. %$* 119
and if you interpret the motion that way, i think you need to say-- %$* 119
invoke with-- %$* 119
where graham and i stand. %$* 119
thank you, richard falkenrath. %$* 13
and our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and here to speak against this motion-- %$* 13
it means he does think the u.s. has a dog in the fight in syria-- %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
he's a former british ambassador to the u.s. and foreign policy and defense adviser to prime minister tony blair. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, well, thank you very much for listening this evening. %$* 285
i'm not a gung-ho interventionist. %$* 285
i've spent my life being as a pragmatist and a realist about these things. %$* 285
and as you mentioned at the beginning, john, six years ago, my prime minister, tony blair, sent me to damascus to try to negotiate with president assad for a better, less confrontational relationship between syria and our countries. %$* 285
and we made a bit of progress. %$* 285
we had a long day of negotiation. %$* 285
we made a bit of progress in relation to syria's relationship with iraq. %$* 285
but on the big issues-- %$* 285
on iran, on lebanon, on his overall relationship with us, i came away empty-handed. %$* 285
and i concluded two things from that. %$* 285
the first thing was, the importance-- %$* 285
the really crucial importance of syria in its region and internationally. %$* 285
things won't get done in this region-- %$* 285
and america has many interests-- %$* 285
iran, israel, much else in the middle east-- %$* 285
without syria being much more stable, having much better future than it has today. %$* 285
and secondly, i concluded assad wouldn't make good choices by himself. %$* 285
unfortunately, things have collapsed significantly since then, because he reacted as badly and unwisely as he did to the revolution which started in march of 2011. %$* 285
he could have handled it differently, but he chose to terrorize his people, 100,000 people said, as we've all said. %$* 285
so, i agree with what rich said earlier. %$* 285
i don't think there's a difference between us in the sense of do we care. %$* 285
yes, i think we do. %$* 285
it's a question about how much and what our tolerance is for allowing the present situation to continue, and about whether we really have reacted to the different world in the middle east today and elsewhere, where we can't find perfect situations and where we need to intervene in the best way we can. %$* 285
and we think there is a realistic prospect of getting to a position where the syrians themselves can decide. %$* 285
and that's what we got to back. %$* 285
and that's our dog in the fight. %$* 285
thank you. %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
and here to speak in support of the motion who says the u.s.does not have a dog in this fight graham allison. %$* 13
he is director of harvard's belfer center for science and international affairs and former assistant secretary of defense. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 283
my old professor, henry kissinger, has a cushion in his home office that says, “try to be the person your dog thinks you are.” okay? %$* 283
so, if you find your dog in the fight, you're obliged to do everything you physically can-- %$* 283
including risks to your own life and limb-- %$* 283
to rescue your dog. %$* 283
okay? %$* 283
i had that experience only once. %$* 283
i almost killed a german shepherd that had its jaws around the throat of our little corgi, annie. %$* 283
and i hope i never have such an experience again. %$* 283
so, that's to have a dog in the fight. %$* 283
as you think about your vote tonight, i would say, ask three questions-- %$* 283
i would urge you to consider three questions. %$* 283
first, we are just exiting two wars in which we entered without understanding the realities of the country to which we sent americans to fight-- %$* 283
so, who imagines that we understand what's happening in syria better than we did in iraq and afghanistan? %$* 283
second question-- %$* 283
this has come up in the debates that we had the aspen strategy group this week. %$* 283
there're almost parallel realities. %$* 283
on the one hand, foreign policy experts look abroad and say, “here dragons: this is a problem, this is a danger. %$* 283
we need to mount an effort.” but there's another reality, which is where is this country today? %$* 283
look at washington-- %$* 283
not just broke, but broken. %$* 283
stalemated. %$* 283
unable to even have a budget. %$* 283
and maybe on a drift to a closedown of the government. %$* 283
is this a government that's ready to engage in yet another military operation? %$* 283
finally, i would say-- %$* 283
it-- %$* 283
for those of you-- %$* 283
for those of you that have children or grandchildren, if you imagine that by voting that we have a dog in the fight, you were at risk of sending your daughter or son to syria, how would you vote? %$* 283
graham allison, thank you very much. %$* 13
your time. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
once again, it's the 1-2-3 vote. %$* 13
if you were persuaded by the side that is arguing that the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria, push number 1.it's this side. %$* 13
if you were persuaded by their opponents, who are arguing that yes, the u.s. does have a dog in the fight in syria-- %$* 13
that is this side-- %$* 13
push number 2. and if you are undecided, became undecided, or remain undecided, push number 3. and we'll have the results and the announcement of the winner-- %$* 13
according to our rules-- %$* 13
in just about two minutes. %$* 13
and once again, we determine victory by the number of percentage points that has moved from one side to the other. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, i just want to take care of a couple of pleasant pieces of business. %$* 13
and the main one is to say that the spirit and the honesty and the respect for one another that these debaters brought to the stage is what intelligence squared aims for. %$* 13
the level of argument was superb and i want to thank them for that. %$* 13
i also want to say that very often, the questions are a problematic area in these debates. %$* 13
they were superb tonight. %$* 13
every single question was on point. %$* 13
or if it wasn't, it was quickly refashioned. %$* 13
and it really moved this debate in a better direction. %$* 13
so, i want to thank everybody who had the nerve to get up and ask a question. %$* 13
i also want to thank, for being here with us, some guests that we're delighted to have. %$* 13
the former secretary of state, secretary albright. %$* 13
thank you very much for being here. %$* 13
also, i think i saw brent scowcroft and-- %$* 13
yeah-- %$* 13
ash carter also and john podesta is also here. %$* 13
and what i respect about this is that all of you-- %$* 13
sorry-- %$* 13
joe nye-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we can go on and on. %$* 13
this is a very illustrious crowd. %$* 13
what we appreciate about having you here-- %$* 13
why we appreciate having you here is that for all of you, none of this is just theoretical. %$* 13
you've all been in these situations and it wasn't the show on a stage. %$* 13
you actually had to make the decisions. %$* 13
we respect and thank all of you for having done your best in making all those decisions all this time. %$* 13
and thank you for being here with us. %$* 13
so, we would love it-- %$* 13
those of you who tweet-- %$* 13
not sure this is a big tweeting crowd. %$* 13
but for those of you who tweet, our twitter-- %$* 13
we would love it if you tweeted about this debate. %$* 13
our handle is @iq2us-- %$* 13
the hashtag is #syria. %$* 13
and we also really want to thank the aspen strategy group for bringing us here. %$* 13
it's been a terrific partnership and a very, very good relationship. %$* 13
and the fact that the leader of the aspen strategy group was actually one of the contestants does not mean the fix was in. %$* 13
anyway. %$* 13
for those of you who will be in new york this fall, please make sure to join us for a series of upcoming debates. %$* 13
the topics we are going to be debating are drones, breaking up the big banks, the global job market, the second amendment, and the case for going vegan. %$* 13
which is one we could also come back here and do, i think. %$* 13
tickets are on sale now. %$* 13
for more information and to join our mailing list, just visit our website. %$* 13
that is www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and for those of you who cannot join our live audience and those of you who are now watching us on various live streams, we're on fora.tv, we thank them for providing the video version of this tonight. %$* 13
we're also streaming on our own site, iq2us.org. %$* 13
and you can listen to these debates on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
this debate will be one of those. %$* 13
you can hear your own applause, laughter, and questions. %$* 13
just check with your local listings for dates and times. %$* 13
and finally we would love it if you would stay in touch with us on twitter and facebook. %$* 13
and if you do that, you can let us know the topics that you're interested in seeing us debate. %$* 13
we take those seriously, and debates have come out of that source of information. %$* 13
so that's it. %$* 13
was i handed a piece of paper with the results? %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
remember, once again, it's the team who has changed your vote the most in terms of percentage points from before the debate to after the debate. %$* 13
oh, i have a note that i needed to say also thank you and hello to walter isaacson. %$* 13
hello, walter isaacson. %$* 13
we chatted beforehand. %$* 13
the motion is this: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
before the debate 40 percent of you agreed with the motion that he u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria, 28 percent were against the motion, and 32 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the opening results. %$* 13
remember, i'm going to say this one last time, it's the team who has changed your minds the most in terms of percentage points will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so here's the second vote. %$* 13
on this motion: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria, the team arguing for the second motion moved to 61 percent, from 40 percent to 61 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 21 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13

so to that extent, it's true. %$* 300
i'm picking on stuff that i did not predict because my worries at the time of passage were about things like the federal budget deficit and would the cost controls hold. %$* 300
will this tamp down innovation, which is, if you think about the millions of unborn or still living but not yet sick people who can be cured by innovations that haven't happened yet, i was worried about that. %$* 300
but we haven't gotten to the point where i can worry about those sorts of things. %$* 300
we've gotten to the point where i'm now worried that this is going to implode and destroy the market for insurance. %$* 300
and by "implosion," you mean bankruptcy, you mean sick people-- %$* 13
sicker people than before? %$* 13
i think that jonathan is way more optimistic than i, that a death spiral isn’t possible. %$* 300
for one thing, you know, a lot of the-- %$* 300
the thing that everyone has been leaning very hard on-- %$* 300
i haven't heard the insurers saying that they are real pleased with the mix. %$* 300
humana and other people have said it's more adverse than they expected. %$* 300
no, at the jpmorgan conference a series of insurers were interviewed, and they all said that they were generally expecting getting what they expected. %$* 301
but that-- %$* 300
neither-- %$* 300
leaving that point aside-- %$* 300
well, i mean, like he can say, "yes, they have," and we can say, "no, they haven't," and you guys don't know either way, so i think this is not-- %$* 300
yeah, i'm actually with her on that. %$* 13
unless-- %$* 13
were any of you at that conference? %$* 13
i was %$* 295
there were a series of insurers quoted at the jpmorgan conference on january 15. %$* 301
there were also a series of insurers quoted, saying that they've had adverse-- %$* 300
and they've announced-- %$* 295
that they're announcing earnings adjustments because of their adverse selection. %$* 300
but that's not really even-- %$* 300
the issue is that, you know, a lot of the mechanisms they're depending on are these things called these risk corridors, which are temporary kind of reinsurance facilities to help insurers transition, and also the fact that these subsidies basically grow with the cost of the policy so that if we do start seeing adverse selection, if we do see young people not in the pools, healthy people not in the pools and so costs go up, well, then the subsidies will rise and these risk corridors will kick in. %$* 300
but those things end in 2018. subsidy-- %$* 300
all right, let's let jonathan chait-- %$* 13
right, but what we're seeing right now is that they're not even going to need that kind of adjustment in the first place because they're saying the pool of people is young enough that it's meeting their expectations, that they don't need to raise premiums, whatsoever. %$* 301
and so if you want to-- %$* 301
if you have to ask, "what is the definition of success? %$* 301
" the definition of success is putting in place a law that will get at a certain point to having a dramatic expansion of coverage. %$* 301
so at one point you said, "well, by january 1, there aren't as many people covered as there were before." %$* 301
i said we don't know. %$* 300
right, we don't know. %$* 301
the government will not-- %$* 300
you're right, you said-- %$* 301
that's correct. %$* 301
the administration will not say-- %$* 300
right, we don't know exactly-- %$* 301
that we have more people covered. %$* 300
right-- %$* 301
we don't know the number of people who had their plans cancelled. %$* 301
it's way less than five million. %$* 301
we don't know, so we can't say exactly how many but why is january 1, the first date the law started, the best mark? %$* 301
the law's supposed to-- %$* 301
stop right there because i want to hear the answer to that question. %$* 13
well-- %$* 300
we know this pool is exceedingly unhealthy by virtue of-- %$* 295
no, no, no, that's-- %$* 13
his question is "why set january 1 on the day that everything has to be successful? %$* 13
" it's a fair question. %$* 13
i just want to hear the answer to it. %$* 13
megan, megan. %$* 13
totally fair question, but, again, this is so much worse than i would've predicted. %$* 300
i was a critic of the law, but if you had asked me, "is it likely that there could be fewer people insured, even that small number, on january 1? %$* 300
" i would've said, "no, that's insane." but that may actually be-- %$* 300
the administration won't-- %$* 300
it's not asking them how many people. %$* 300
when reporters on conference calls say, "can you assure us that more people are insured through anything, through private insurance, through medicaid? %$* 300
" they won't say, "yes." %$* 300
what does it tell you that no-- %$* 295
people don't want this coverage. %$* 295
the administration on the conference call which i was on the other day, and announcing this data, bragged about the fact that 44.5 million people went to the website and started to look at health plans, we know only 1.2 million signed up, that conversion rate is worse than banner ads. %$* 295
it's worse than sex ads on twitter. %$* 295
i mean, that is a bad conversion rate. %$* 295
that tells you people are looking at these plans and not buying them because they're not good plans for consumers because they weren't designed to be. %$* 295
doug kamerow. %$* 13
i want to go back and ask the question to you all again, if, in fact, you're saying that obamacare-- %$* 302
doug, i just want to point out if you keep asking questions you don't get to talk. %$* 13
well, but, i mean, the point of the debate is to say that it's beyond-- %$* 302
you know, either it's beyond rescue or it's not beyond rescue. %$* 302
so you guys say can't be saved, can't be fixed. %$* 302
what's the plan then? %$* 302
well, actually they don't need to actually answer that question-- %$* 13
technically to win this debate. %$* 13
but i will say that mr. %$* 300
chait says that i’m against national health care and which is actually not true. %$* 300
i have long been proposing that the government should provide catastrophic reinsurance for people, basically picking up medical costs above fifteen percent of their income. %$* 300
it’s something that preserves the market mechanism. %$* 300
it’s progressive. %$* 300
everyone is-- %$* 300
you know, you're taking care poor, but otherwise it's progressive. %$* 300
it preserves the market mechanism, it makes sure people do not get bankrupted by their medical bills. %$* 300
i think that is actually the kind of system that you could grow out of obamacare if it failed. %$* 300
jonathan chait. %$* 13
the reason i wrote that you're against national health care is because in 2009 you wrote a column called "why i oppose national health care." you've also predicted-- %$* 301
a few months ago you predicted the exchanges might not even open on january 1, that the administration would have to stop its whole law. %$* 301
so if you're talking about moving the goal post your definition of failure just keeps getting smaller and smaller. %$* 301
well, i'm just saying that in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and 2013, i have written that i support the sort of catastrophic reinsurance program. %$* 300
i've been proposing it for a fairly long time. %$* 300
let me tell you what a death spiral looks like. %$* 295
every year-- %$* 295
this is a provision that a lot of people haven't noticed yet. %$* 295
every year that these subsidies make these sort of value of the health plans sold in this law get re-priced. %$* 295
in medicare part d they also get re- priced. %$* 295
the subsidies get re-priced. %$* 295
they get re-priced each year from a blended average of all the plans in the marketplace. %$* 295
they had a convergence of sort of a mean value of the plans. %$* 295
in this marketplace they get re-priced off the second cheapest plan in every market. %$* 295
the second cheapest plan in florida is a plan that has seven pediatricians for a county with 250,000 kids. %$* 295
next year all the policies in florida will now be re-priced off that plan. %$* 295
so all the plans will have to conform to that benefit structure. %$* 295
that is a death spiral. %$* 295
you're using the word death spiral in a way that no one in health care and economics ever uses it. %$* 301
it's a death spiral in the quality of the coverage. %$* 295
you end up with a plan that looks like medicaid. %$* 295
now again, i haven't heard anyone defend medicaid. %$* 295
do you guys want to-- %$* 13
anybody on the actually want to defend medicaid? %$* 13
doug kamerow. %$* 13
well, i want to go back to your point though. %$* 302
just as the point is out there right now, the reason i bring it up is that in his opening statements scott emphasized that essentially obamacare is really a medicaid plan and the problem with that is he talked about the outcomes for medicaid are not satisfactory, but i think it's a valid point for him to have put out there. %$* 13
i think one of the things we have to remember is that this law changes lot’s of things. %$* 302
it doesn't just change the coverage. %$* 302
it also talks about who's going to be taking care of patient on medicaid, what the doctor is going to be paid. %$* 302
as you know, as a practicing doctor, where you practice a lot of places don't take medicaid and they don't take it because the rates are laughable. %$* 302
reimbursement is very low. %$* 302
it's not because, i don’t think, because the patients have certain problems that they're not willing to deal with, seems unlikely. %$* 302
it's a matter of dollars and cents. %$* 302
one of the things it does, at least temporarily it can presumably be extended, raising the rates of medicaid and medicare. %$* 302
a lot of doctors take care of medicare patients. %$* 302
and also i would think that you'd be happy to see these kinds of-- %$* 302
it seems to me at least, speaking from the inside , as a conservative philosophy. %$* 302
you're saying look, if this doesn't work very well, clearly these high-priced providers, wherever they are, are going to have to make some kind of a change. %$* 302
hospitals or other places that are going to be left out of the networks pretty soon-- %$* 302
i'm not happy with giving people false promise. %$* 295
we've done that with medicaid and we've done it now with obamacare. %$* 295
obamacare will evolve into medicaid. %$* 295
it will be the same quality, the same narrow networks, because-- %$* 295
because you're predicting it. %$* 302
well, it's already happening. %$* 295
i mean, if you look at the quality of these plans, if you look at the networks, and i'm putting out data on this next week, i hope everyone goes to the website and sees it. %$* 295
if you look at the networks in obamacare they are medicaid networks. %$* 295
if you look at the plans that are preparing bids for next year, it's medicaid plans that didn’t get into the market this year. %$* 295
this will evolve into a medicaid benefit. %$* 295
we didn't need to obligate people to a medicaid benefit and we have done nothing to fix the existing medicaid benefit. %$* 295
the changes you talk about was a temporary increase, a small increase in payments to primary care providers, that now sunsetted at the very point that we're going to push 19 more million people into medicaid. %$* 295
can you imagine trying to service 19 more million people with the existing medicaid program? %$* 295
what is that going to look like? %$* 295
that's all you keep saying-- %$* 301
obligate people to medicaid, but i don't think the word means what you think it means. %$* 301
no one is obligated to go on medicaid. %$* 301
people are offered to go on medicaid and they very rationally choose to go on medicaid. %$* 301
because it's free. %$* 302
right. %$* 301
now, our opponents have made two different claims about medicaid. %$* 301
scott’s made a terrible argument about the quality of medicaid and megan made one that is merely bad. %$* 301
scott's argument, he's obliquely citing studies that have taken two populations, one of which is on medicaid and one which is not on medicaid and compared their health. %$* 301
now, if you're on medicaid you're in a terrible place. %$* 301
something has gone bad in your life. %$* 301
you're very poor. %$* 301
you're very sick. %$* 301
bad things are happening to you. %$* 301
so, a lot of studies are comparing two completely different kinds of populations and finding the people on medicaid are worse off. %$* 301
jonathan-- %$* 295
those are the studies people don't take seriously. %$* 301
the studies controlled that. %$* 295
then the study that megan cited is still not a very good use of data. %$* 301
it's not a good use of data for two reasons-- %$* 301
if i may-- %$* 301
very-- %$* 13
number one-- %$* 301
very briefly, but you've got two people lined up to defend themselves. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 18
so, there are a series of studies on the effectiveness of medicaid. %$* 301
many of these studies-- %$* 301
most of them show what you would intuitively think. %$* 301
going on medicaid and being able to see doctors, even if you don't get a lot of choice, even if a lot of doctors don't want to take the low prices, is better than not having health insurance and going to good-- %$* 301
going to the doctor at all. %$* 301
because as my partner explained in fairly strong detail, not having health insurance is dangerous. %$* 301
it's terrible. %$* 301
nobody wants to have it. %$* 301
and people are right not to want it-- %$* 301
megan mcardle. %$* 13
well, it shows actually-- %$* 300
here's something interesting-- %$* 300
is a lot of these studies have looked at medicaid versus the uninsured. %$* 300
and the uninsured do better. %$* 300
having no insurance is better in these studies than having medicaid, even when you control for now, that said, do i think that having medicaid is actually worse than being uninsured? %$* 300
no, i don't. %$* 300
it's very hard to actually measure lots of things. %$* 300
but the-- %$* 300
you would want to know about the impulse control, or social support and so forth. %$* 300
but i think that most people agree that medicaid is bad coverage. %$* 300
it's not good coverage. %$* 300
you wouldn't want to go on it. %$* 300
and there are people who had cheap policies canceled-- %$* 300
got cancellation notices and found that when they went to the exchanges, they were were into medicaid. %$* 300
that's %$* 300
so, let-- %$* 13
i think-- %$* 13
so i'm not-- %$* 300
scott, go ahead and then i will ask-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 295
i think the discussion about medicaid is operative here, because this is-- %$* 295
this is a real dilemma that i can't get to the bottom of. %$* 295
people feel good about medicaid in washington. %$* 295
i worked in washington. %$* 295
people look at the benefits that are being promised on paper in medicaid and think that it is a fabulous program. %$* 295
the practical reality is that anyone who works in the medical marketplace knows that's just not the case. %$* 295
we have done the same thing with obamacare. %$* 295
we have promised something that looks very good on paper. %$* 295
the practical reality that's already taking shape in the marketplace is people are not going to be able to get what they're being promised on paper. %$* 295
and so, the question becomes, why do we feel good about what we do in washington on paper when the reality doesn't approximate what we've said we've done-- %$* 295
all right. %$* 13
well, that actually takes me to-- %$* 13
to-- %$* 13
that takes me to my question, because my sense of what this motion says is that the rube goldberg machine that megan's described the obamacare plan as being is doomed finally to crash a-- %$* 13
crashing to a halt. %$* 13
and your opponents are saying, it may be a rube goldberg machine, but it's going to keep moving in its fashion. %$* 13
and it already is moving and things are happening, and it can be tweaked around the edges. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
you're not actually describing a rube goldberg machine coming to a halt. %$* 13
you're describing a rube goldberg machine producing an outcome that you don't like. %$* 13
well, no, i-- %$* 300
i mean, and this should have been-- %$* 13
if it's medicaid, it's not good. %$* 13
well, but-- %$* 18
and that's fair enough that that's your argument. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
but it's not an outcome i don't like. %$* 295
it's-- %$* 295
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
i don't mean ideologically. %$* 13
i mean, you're saying it's an outcome that nobody should cherish, that it's going to be more sick people at more cost with less competition. %$* 13
but-- %$* 295
is that what you mean by "beyond repair? %$* 13
it's not what we set out to do. %$* 295
we set out to achieve something and we're not even-- %$* 295
we're not even pretending that we're going to achieve it. %$* 295
i mean, i-- %$* 295
they can't defend that medicaid is an abysmal benefit in terms of what it's promised and what it's delivering and obamacare won't involve it, with medicaid-like benefits. %$* 295
either one of you to say what you think the obama-- %$* 13
white house plan hopes to achieve and how we're falling short of it already. %$* 13
well, i don't-- %$* 295
i think that what they hoped to achieve was a program that even if it wasn't perfect, would be politically self-sustaining in that it would be impossible to repeal, because some, they think, would love it. %$* 300
and i think that's what a key issue is with medicaid-- %$* 300
okay. %$* 13
and with these narrow networks, is people aren't going to love these and aren't going to fight to keep them. %$* 300
okay. %$* 13
great. %$* 13
then-- %$* 13
that's a point i want to bring to the other side-- %$* 13
because there's the argument being made here that for the program to be sustained, there needs to be an issue of public trust, enthusiasm, and participation so that people will sign up for it. %$* 13
and they're saying that they're concerned that with the way things are going, that won't happen and that does make it unsustainable. %$* 13
and i want to take that to the other side gentlemen. %$* 13
you've got to remember, the proposition here is "beyond repair.” so they're not-- %$* 301
that's not a claim about beyond repair. %$* 301
that's a claim about something that might happen in the future that they can plausibly say will be-- %$* 301
i think it's a-- %$* 13
the %$* 18
i think it's a fair sort of trend line argument. %$* 13
i mean, you may-- %$* 13
i'm not-- %$* 13
right. %$* 301
taking their side, but-- %$* 13
so-- %$* 301
but i think it's-- %$* 13
i think it's-- %$* 13
i think it's food for thought-- %$* 13
right. %$* 301
so the initial projections were-- %$* 301
cbo said they guess about 7 million people would be in the exchanges by the end of the open enrollment period in march. %$* 301
now, the website was broken for the first few months. %$* 301
that wasn't just people could enroll. %$* 301
that means the whole outreach campaign that the administration, its outside allies, and in the insurers had planned to direct people to this website-- %$* 301
which was broken-- %$* 301
had to be put off. %$* 301
so basically, we’ve lost two-thirds of the time to enroll people in the exchanges. %$* 301
it was trying to enroll people in the exchanges that we've had, october, november, december. %$* 301
only december wasn't working. %$* 301
yet-- %$* 301
so in one third of the time they've had available, they did a whole two thirds of the target they were supposed to have in the exchanges. %$* 301
they thought by the end of december they would have three million. %$* 301
instead, they have two million. %$* 301
so that seems to be-- %$* 301
but they're saying it-- %$* 13
they're saying it does need to be popular to succeed and that it's not popular and they don't think it's going to be %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 18
well, i'm sorry. %$* 13
i shouldn't speak for you if you want to speak, scott. %$* 13
go ahead, and then i want to go to questions from the audience right after that. %$* 13
this is very quickly evolving into a plan for service. %$* 295
the high risk pool of the service people who have preexisting conditions were priced at a prior market aren't in the existing insurance pool, and those below 200 percent of federal poverty levels benefit enough from the subsidies to make these plans even partially affordable. %$* 295
that's about 20-- %$* 295
well, once you get above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, these plans are more expensive than what you could've got in the existing individual market because look at the numbers. %$* 295
they're subsidized up to 400 percent. %$* 295
the subsidies fall off at 250 percent quite rapidly. %$* 295
that's about 20 million people. %$* 295
my question is, "why did we-- %$* 295
" if we wanted to target 20 million people, which is what this law inevitably is going to end up doing, why did we have to disrupt the insurance scheme for 350 million americans? %$* 295
i mean, everyone was affected by this. %$* 295
and there's simply no evidence of any of that disruption. %$* 18
all right, i want to audience questions-- %$* 13
how many people-- %$* 295
how many people got notice from insurance plans, that their plans were changed or canceled this year? %$* 295
i guess in new york city. %$* 295
all right, that works so well on radio when the hands go up. %$* 13
for the radio audience, a scattering of hands went up. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." let's go to some audience questions. %$* 13
and i sir, in the reddish shirt, i'm not good with color description once we're off the basic red, chartreuse? %$* 13
you can stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
and, again, i need this to be a question, and if it's not on point, i'll have to pass. %$* 13
thanks, go ahead. %$* 13
hi, guys, my name is david, and my question is if you can't determine who has enrolled and who has cancelled, how will you be able to input the penalties that are paid due to obamacare plan? %$* 18
well, i think the penalties are irrelevant. %$* 295
nobody actually believes those penalties are going to be enforced. %$* 295
they're just a claw back on your tax return if you're owed a refund. %$* 295
a clever accountant can easily structure your tax returns so that you would never have to pay a penalty. %$* 295
i think everyone recognizes the individual mandate, so- called tax penalty really isn't an operating feature in this anymore, and will probably be suspended this year, but they will wait till after march 31 to do it. %$* 295
yeah, i would also guess that sometime in april the administration will announce that mandate is not going to be enforced for 2014, this year everything is going to be disrupted and not going according to plan and we will have people who lost insurance and didn’t get it, and the political backlash would slowly dismantling the law in order to preserve its temporary political viability. %$* 300
would the other side like to also answer the question? %$* 13
i'm not sure why they have to going to be-- %$* 302
that's going to be delayed, but even if it is delayed, it still doesn't go to the point that it's not going to ultimately be useful and even despite the tax dodges that people like dr. %$* 302
gottlieb have access to-- %$* 302
i'm sorry, scott, my mistake. %$* 302
that's all right. %$* 295
that scott has access to, even without those, there's a bit of a moral imperative where people don't like to break the law, people don't like to do what they're not supposed to do, and that's one of the reasons, the moral imperative was put in there. %$* 302
another question. %$* 13
oh, sir, right down here, sorry. %$* 13
on this side? %$* 13
my question is for scott and megan, so-- %$* 303
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
my name is rahod janahan so clearly obamacare is a large scale complex change. %$* 303
my question is are you opposing the intention, execution, or both of this large scale reform change? %$* 303
well, i'll let megan speak for herself. %$* 295
i was quite clear, and i've been quite clear when i've talked about this a lot. %$* 295
i think the goals here were laudable. %$* 295
i think we have to do something to try to help people who are priced out of the insurance market or people who found themselves in between plans that didn't have-- %$* 295
weren't in insurance pools where they had portability. %$* 295
we could've addressed those issues in a far more disrupting with so many dislocations in the marketplace. %$* 295
i think we still can. %$* 295
this isn't the edifice to do it. %$* 295
we-- %$* 295
i-- %$* 295
okay, scott, you-- %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
would like to go to megan because you actually made that point a couple times, because i asked that very same question, but not in very good way so i get to hear megan. %$* 13
do i have the intentions of protecting families from financial damage for medical bills? %$* 300
absolutely. %$* 300
do i think that the execution was good? %$* 300
i think that's a hard argument to make. %$* 300
but, you know, i also think that there are better structures and attempts to like preserve everything that any person in the united states had, which we already know wasn't possible manage to do it, while simultaneously layering a bunch of new stuff on top of that, was just an inherently flawed design, i don't think that i understood that it would be executed so badly, but i-- %$* 300
so your answer is both? %$* 13
yes. %$* 300
okay. %$* 13
that woman right there. %$* 13
my name is dana. %$* 19
so we've seen that universal health care to be successfully implemented in other countries than the u.s. can we explain why it can work there and not here? %$* 19
are there learnings that we can take to adapt the current system to be more successful? %$* 19
can you rephrase that question that gets them to talk about whether it's beyond repair? %$* 13
okay, so can we take-- %$* 19
can we take lessons from successful implementation of universal health care in order to prevent obamacare from being unsuccessful or beyond repair? %$* 19
thank you, i think that did that. %$* 13
that's a question i think that's for this side, so i'm going to let them take it. %$* 13
i'll want you to give me a response depending on what they say, and if somebody has a question for this side, it's not getting many, i would like to have some thank you. %$* 13
i think of it as sort of like the autobahn, which is great, but i wouldn't necessarily say that you could just build that in the united states now. %$* 300
we already have a highway system. %$* 300
and so looking at what another country has done with a really long history is helpful in the sense that you can see elements that work, but that doesn't mean that we can have germany's health care system. %$* 300
we have a different set of doctors and nurses and patients and all sorts of things, and that's why i like the idea of a kind of very american - - we're going to have the government insure your financial losses after a certain point, but we're going to leave you out there as a market driven consumer, making choices of whatever health care you want when you get sick. %$* 300
i think that's exactly point is, is that is if you don't like a state run kind of program, then, you know, you don't like the kind of systems that are elsewhere. %$* 302
you can say, "we're not the same, we're different," but it is interesting that every advanced economy in the west and some more in the east has these kinds of programs, and yet there is something special about us where we can't seem, apparently, figure out a way to do it here. %$* 302
we've got to have some special american take on it. %$* 302
so i think we probably can learn from it. %$* 302
i think we probably can learn a lot from other countries. %$* 302
well, you know, we-- %$* 295
i mean, we have-- %$* 295
look, we have a market that's much more fragmented in a much larger country. %$* 295
we have people who want to exercise more choice in their benefits design. %$* 295
we have people who have higher expectations than what many people are willing to acquiesce to in other countries, and the one final point i'd make is that the structures in obamacare that i've talked about tonight, the narrow networks, the closed drug formulators, i guarantee you they're going to be showing up in your commercial plans in the next two years. %$* 295
these structures will not be confined to obamacare. %$* 295
they will now migrate into the commercial marketplace. %$* 295
i-- %$* 301
here's one way to tie this together. %$* 301
for years and years, when you asked conservatives about national health reform, they would say some horror story, right? %$* 301
they would say some man in canada walked 100 miles in snow and lost his feet because of the socialist horrors of canada to come to the freedom of america, and everyone in britain has lost their teeth because of the nih-- %$* 301
and all these, you know, weird kind of mix of anecdotes and half-truths. %$* 301
those %$* 301
but that's actually true, jonathan. %$* 300
that was what was like floating around out there. %$* 301
and i think what's happened here is that all these horror stories simply migrated to the united states and now describe obamacare. %$* 301
they've kind of forgotten all about the horrors of socialized medicine, and the way that they understood national health insurance in the other countries is now the way they understand national health insurance in the united states. %$* 301
it's a very partial anecdotal kind of slightly hysterical way. %$* 301
i'm so tempted to ask who in the audience is british and would like to smile at us right now. %$* 13
our motion is, "obamacare is now beyond rescue," and i'm saying that because i've repeatedly said it's beyond repair. %$* 13
the motion language is beyond rescue. %$* 13
here comes a question right now. %$* 13
and if you rise, they'll find you a mic. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i'm michelle. %$* 19
i'd love to ask the group against the motion to have a chance to explain why the obamacare needs a bit more time for it to play out. %$* 19
i find it a little bit unrealistic that partisan zealots in washington are ready to kill it, and it's only a couple of months out of the gate, and i'd love to hear them explain to the audience why and how obamacare is going to succeed over the next year. %$* 19
well-- %$* 301
jonathan chait. %$* 13
you know, i think it's kind of self evident that this target date-- %$* 301
that we've heard from the other side of-- %$* 301
are things better by january 1 is oddly irrelevant, the first day that the law is actually in operation. %$* 301
the point is to make a change over a series of years. %$* 301
now, the outreach campaign to the public is something that by definition just takes months and months and months and years and years and years to build up. %$* 301
and no one envisioned that the law would reach its coverage target even under the best circumstances the first year. %$* 301
and again, the website responded. %$* 301
so, in 2013 they lost two-thirds of the available time. %$* 301
so naturally you're just going to move back the target for the ramp up year, you're going to hit it more slowly, but nothing about that process changes the law's ability to fundamentally reach its goals in the coarse of time. %$* 301
we're also making a huge change here, there’s no question about that, and it takes time to do that. %$* 302
plus lots of the law has things that are demonstrations, that are experiments, that are trying to find different ways to improve things. %$* 302
and we're not going to know the results of those for a year, two years, or even more. %$* 302
and they can, the nice thing about it centers for medicare and medicaid, can then ramp things up when they find successes in demonstrations to show how we can help to incentivize patients, those kinds of things are out there in existence right now. %$* 302
look. %$* 295
you know just one comment to follow up on what doug said. %$* 295
what doug is talking about reform, these are things we've been talking about for a decade and they're not a key feature of obamacare, although they were in the law. %$* 295
we could've done a lot of that without disrupting the entire commercial insurance marketplace these were bipartisan ideas. %$* 295
i'm not sure that obamacare is going to successfully implement them anyway. %$* 295
i'll just give you one anecdote. %$* 295
they have a new law that hospitals get penalized for readmission, so hospitals are admitting fewer patients. %$* 295
when patients show up in the er they're being put in what's called observation status. %$* 295
they're sitting in the hospital for 36 hours and not being admitted and so since they're not admitted to the hospital, they're considered outpatient, so they're being hit with 20 percent co-pays on that. %$* 295
and, of course, other hospitals are working on programs where they have outreach workers for the first time to try to follow up with patients. %$* 302
this isn't obamacare, doug. %$* 295
these are ideas they could've done apart from disrupting the entire marketplace %$* 295
very much part of obamacare. %$* 302
i mean, you're saying obamacare is beyond rescue. %$* 302
we're saying lots of parts are doing good things. %$* 302
obamacare is a federalization of insurance, though. %$* 295
that's what obamacare is. %$* 295
i mean, this was a feature added into obamacare. %$* 295
we could've done that in separate bills. %$* 295
part of the law is working and you're saying this functional part of the law could-- %$* 301
might have been tapped without obamacare, but whether or not that's true it’s in the law. %$* 301
but is it an unsuccessful federalization of health care or %$* 13
it's a bait and switch, they're arguing components of obamacare. %$* 295
that's not the essence of what the law set out to do. %$* 295
they were thinking they were attached to obamacare. %$* 295
the sunshine act is part of obamacare. %$* 295
no, the law set out to do things to reform the cost structure of benefits to control costs and by all evidence it's succeeding beyond the best expectations and-- %$* 301
you know, the recession lowered medical spending. %$* 295
let's be honest. %$* 295
megan mcardle. %$* 13
even the government's actuaries say, you know, cms economists are saying that it was the recession, not obamacare. %$* 300
but look, you know, is everything in obamacare going to go away? %$* 300
no. %$* 300
obamacare involves, for example, changes to the student loan program. %$* 300
are those going to be rolled back if the insurance markets don't work out? %$* 300
no. %$* 300
the question is, are the major super structures going to stay in place, and especially the things that you needed to do of a piece. %$* 300
you know, our-- %$* 300
we're going to go back to-- %$* 300
we're going to take kids under 26 off their parents insurance? %$* 300
i doubt it. %$* 300
but that doesn't, you know-- %$* 300
but are you-- %$* 13
megan, are you saying that those few examples of things that are popular and working are fringe to the basic concept? %$* 13
that's entirely fringe. %$* 300
okay. %$* 13
are those things fringe to the basic concept of obamacare that this side is arguing towards? %$* 13
no. %$* 301
i mean, the law intended to do a lot of things. %$* 301
it intended to cover people in a lot of ways. %$* 301
covering people under 26. that was the way they covered people under 26. but controlling costs-- %$* 301
what they decided to do was not have one big blunt force wave to hold down medical inflation they let thousand flowers bloom and change the infrastructure in a lot of ways and there's a lot of good evidence-- %$* 301
okay. %$* 13
so what we have here is your basic disagreement about what we mean by obamacare. %$* 13
it's a big law with a lot-- %$* 301
with two major goals accomplished in a bunch of different ways. %$* 301
all right, but you both need to persuade the audience that way you're talking about is obamacare that we’re arguing about. %$* 13
as an audience they have to consider that. %$* 13
yes, right down-- %$* 13
right here. %$* 13
i guess my question would be to both sides. %$* 18
being that it is a large, you know, plan, meaning that it has to be popular. %$* 18
how much would you say that the backlash from republicans instead of making it pretty much not work as a whole, just kind of delaying it by spreading all of this venom about it? %$* 18
i'm going to pass on the question, because i think they actually address that. %$* 13
i think it's a great question, but i think it was addressed when they were talking about the definition of failure i think that here comes the mic to you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is jennifer and my question is both positions have admitted that there is a lack of metrics program. %$* 19
if we lack quantitative data, which we use to assess organizations and businesses health, then how can we measure the potential sustainability of the program? %$* 19
good question. %$* 13
so we're-- %$* 301
i think where we lack the metrics is how many people had their plans with their private insurance plans cancelled? %$* 301
that's what we don't know. %$* 301
and that's the kind of negative sum in their ledger, that they're trying to say the law failed. %$* 301
we don't really know that no one has the-- %$* 301
but we do know who's signing up. %$* 301
we've got very good metrics on that. %$* 301
so, do we know how many people are going in the exchanges, how many people are going into medicaid, what type of healthcare costs? %$* 301
all those things can be measured and are being measured. %$* 301
and they're all very positive. %$* 301
you-- %$* 295
there's absolutely metrics around this program. %$* 295
the problem is the administration doesn't want to release the numbers. %$* 295
as far as the cancellations, you've made the point a few times. %$* 295
it is 5 million. %$* 295
it might be more. %$* 295
all you need to do is look at the analyst reports around you at the united/humana, which are very large insurers. %$* 295
and it comes to something very close to that. %$* 295

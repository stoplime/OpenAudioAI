what robert rosenkranz really said in this debate, very often we do debates where things divide very clearly, policy issues where it's yes or no, where it's black or white. %$* 13
it was his feeling that this is one debate where the richness of the debate actually comes from the fact that there are an awful lot of shades of gray and shades of meaning in the issue, that black and white and yes or no, even though we're asking you to vote at that level, it's very complicated. %$* 13
and so he was looking forward to this being, in a sense, one of the more complex debates that we were going to have and have ever staged. %$* 13
so with that thought, let's please welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and because we're being broadcast for radio and television, there are various points throughout the evening where we like the radio audience in particular to know that you, our live audience, are here. %$* 13
so you can absolutely give voice. %$* 13
this is not like a presidential debate where you're not allowed to applaud. %$* 13
you can give voice to your passions in this. %$* 13
you can laugh, cheer, react however you want to. %$* 13
we just want it to not be mean spirited. %$* 13
we discourage you from hissing, for example. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but a chuckle like that is fine. %$* 13
and here and there, again, i'm just going to ask you to applaud entirely spontaneously, but it has to be when i ask you. %$* 13
work for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
and when i introduce, in a moment, each of our debaters, the first time i mention their name, i'll do a little of this, and that means, please welcome these-- %$* 13
these debaters with a round of applause. %$* 13
but let's just begin the whole thing, please. %$* 13
welcome them to the stage one more time. %$* 13
so most of us would do almost anything for our kids to help them be their best, to help them get ahead. %$* 13
but what if even before they were born we could go in and alter their genes in such a way to give them an even greater advantage, to give them strength against illness and disease, to make them smarter or taller or prettier even if their parents themselves never had any of those traits. %$* 13
well, that world is coming. %$* 13
who's tempted? %$* 13
and who is horrified? %$* 13
let's find out. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
i will be moderating as the four superbly qualified debaters you see on the stage argue for and against this motion, two against two: prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds. %$* 13
and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, prohibit genetically engineered babies, sheldon krimsky, a professor at tufts university and chair of the council for responsible genomics his partner is robert winston, a professor of science and society and emeritus professor of fertility studies at imperial college, london. %$* 13
team arguing against the motion, they are arguing against the prohibition of genetically engineered babies, include nita farahany. %$* 13
she is a professor at duke law and research professor at duke's institute for genome sciences and policy. %$* 13
oh, okay. %$* 13
i just got a note in my ear, sheldon, that i misnamed your institute, your council, so i'm going to-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah, so i'm going to just say it out loud, and then we'll fix it in post. %$* 13
actually it'll work, and then i'm going to come back to you later. %$* 13
i know you're all set to take your bow. %$* 13
just hold that thought, and i'm going to introduce sheldon again. %$* 13
and if you could applaud again, we'll fix it in the edit. %$* 13
so, sheldon krimsky, a professor at tufts university and chair of the council for responsible genetics. %$* 13
to anybody-- %$* 13
you know, we're fine with breaking the fourth wall. %$* 13
if i misspeak ever, just correct me right then and there. %$* 13
it's not a problem. %$* 13
and nita farahany's partner, her partner is lee silver, professor of molecular biology at princeton university and author of the book "challenging nature." our motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies." let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
and, sheldon, you are a professor at tufts university and chair of the council for responsible genetics. %$* 13
your research has focused on the intersection of science, ethics, and public policy. %$* 13
your very first book in this area was published in 1982. it was a social history of what was then considered a very, very controversial new technology, "gene splicing," 30 years ago, which could lead to the mistake that you are a geneticist, but actually you are a philosopher. %$* 13
a philosopher of science, and i deal with the issues of ethics and also contested issues in science, and, of course, genetics provides great material. %$* 481
and natural science came out of philosophy, so there remains a connection between these two? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 481
okay, and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is professor robert winston. %$* 481
ladies and gentlemen, robert winston. %$* 13
robert, you are a professor of science and society at imperial college, london-- %$* 13
who not only did groundbreaking work in fertility studies but also in the field of prenatal implantation, genetic diagnosis. %$* 13
however, renaissance man, you have also very often been a tv host. %$* 13
you are an award winning theater director, and very recently you were the star of a reality television show in which you learned to play the saxophone-- %$* 13
set out to play the saxophone. %$* 13
so if we brought a sax out right now, you could blow a few notes for us? %$* 13
i would prefer the clarinet, i think. %$* 482
clarinet. %$* 13
well, then we're just going to have to cancel that whole plan. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and, again, our motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies." the two debaters arguing against it, let's welcome, ladies and gentlemen, nita farahany. %$* 13
nita, you are a professor at duke law and you are a research professor at duke's institute for genome sciences and policy, so you are trained both in science and as a lawyer, but in 2010 president obama pointed you to the commission on the study of bioethical issues, and you're still a member. %$* 13
so now that you've done science and you've done law, how are you liking politics? %$* 13
i think i'll be politic and not answer that. %$* 483
so you have debated before. %$* 13
yeah, indeed. %$* 483
ladies and gentlemen, nita farahany. %$* 13
nita, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is lee silver. %$* 483
lee silver, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
lee, you are also arguing against this motion to prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
you are a professor of molecular biology at princeton. %$* 13
one of your landmark books was called "mouse genetics." it's a book about mouse genetics. %$* 13
and those are relevant because mice and humans share an astounding number of genes. %$* 13
it's a very high percentage, is it not? %$* 13
i look at mice as little people. %$* 484
yeah? %$* 13
so you're not-- %$* 13
the thought doesn't turn you off and depress you that-- %$* 13
oh, no, no, no. %$* 484
mice have done a lot for human health. %$* 484
all right, ladies and gentlemen, lee silver. %$* 13
those are our four debaters. %$* 13
so let's get to the first round of voting. %$* 13
remember, you will be asked to vote twice by the time the debate has ended, once before you've heard the arguments and once again after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies." if you agree with the motion, push number 1, if you disagree, push number 2, and if you are uncertain, push number 3.you can ignore all of the other keys, they're not live; and if you push the wrong key just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and we'll shut this out in about 10 seconds. %$* 13
and so remember how you voted; we'll have you vote again after the three rounds of debate. %$* 13
and in that case, the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
onto round 1: opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies," and here to argue first for the motion, sheldon krimsky, professor of humanities and social sciences at tufts university. %$* 13
he is chair of the board of directors for the council for responsible genetics and coeditor of the book "genetic explanations: sense and nonsense." ladies and gentlemen, sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 481
thank you very much. %$* 481
the proposition before us today, to me means prenatal genetic modification of human reproductive cells, like sperm or eggs or fertilized eggs, called the zygote, in preparation for gestation in the womb and development to full term infants should be prohibited at the societal level, and to this i agree firmly. %$* 481
the two basic reasons to carry out such an intervention: one, for curing or preventing genetic disease; or, two, for the enhancement of a person. %$* 481
for genetic diseases, in the great majority of cases there are simpler, less risky, less costly, less ethically controversial, and more dependable methods of preventing the birth of a child with a severe genetic abnormality by using prenatal embryo diagnosis; that is, for diagnosing the embryos. %$* 481
there are a couple of exceptions, which i think we will get to during this debate, such as mitochondrial disease. %$* 481
and we'll have more to say about that later. %$* 481
other than the exception, the only sensible rationale for engaging in genetic modification of the fertilized egg is for the enhancement of a child. %$* 481
enhancement might include intelligence, resistance to disease, greater height, muscle strength, appealing personality, longevity, any number of things you could imagine. %$* 481
now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive cells, for enhancement is where i find the greatest moral failure and the greatest scientific folly. %$* 481
i offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their health. %$* 481
no set of animal studies can ensure the safety and efficacy of human prenatal genetic modification. %$* 481
it is unimaginable that any humane, democratic society would permit such a trial with public or private funds; the risk would so outweigh the societal benefits. %$* 481
my distinguished colleague, professor winston, will address some of the risks, complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early embryo. %$* 481
of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and knowledge gained are of no concern. %$* 481
so that certainly can always happen. %$* 481
this takes us to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two. %$* 481
traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and-- %$* 481
are complex and not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the dna and the gene- gene interactions that occur in human cells. %$* 481
scientists and the so-called trans- humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a lego set, where pieces of dna can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of the system. %$* 481
actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts interrelate and are in mutual balance. %$* 481
even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50 genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples. %$* 481
so there could be hundreds of genes associated with height. %$* 481
if you want a child, a tall child, marry tall. %$* 481
finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human perfection can be directed by genetics. %$* 481
the danger is not so much that it will work, but as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you better. %$* 481
it would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a nobel laureate will give you a genius child. %$* 481
i am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral education. %$* 481
enhancement through genetic engineering of human germ plasm is a fool's paradise and will lead to no good. %$* 481
thank you. %$* 481
thank you, sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
our motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies." and here to argue against this motion, nita farahany. %$* 13
she holds a joint appointment at-- %$* 13
as professor of law and philosophy at duke law and as a research professor at duke's institute for genome sciences and policy. %$* 13
she is also a member of the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nita faranany. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 483
i'd like to thank the rosenkranz foundation for airing this important debate, our moderate for john donvan and my esteemed colleagues in this debate. %$* 483
i am here tonight to represent my personal views, and not the president's commission on bioethics of which i am a member, about why we should not prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 483
in a little while, you'll hear from my debate partner, lee silver, who will debunk many of the scientific claims against genetic engineering. %$* 483
but first i want to convince of you two things: that we already can and have safely genetically engineered babies and that a middle ground of prudent vigilance, public oversight and debate about genetic engineering is better than prohibition. %$* 483
i also want to call your attention to the resolution this evening. %$* 483
it calls for an outright and complete ban on genetic engineering of babies. %$* 483
if lee and i can convince you of any instance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should vote against the resolution. %$* 483
throughout the evening, i'll defend why genetic engineering is no different in kind from the many ways that we already engineer our children, from the partners we choose to prenatal screening to the supplements we take that impact our children and their fates. %$* 483
recently new research shows the powerful effect of taking folate during pregnancy and how it reduces the incidence of autism in children. %$* 483
and yet no one thinks that we should ban folate. %$* 483
but i want to convince you that we already can and have taken the next step of genetic engineering of babies and that we would take a drastic step backwards to ban outright that technology. %$* 483
i'm going to tell you about inherited mitochondrial disorders, which are progressive and cause tragic health consequences. %$* 483
a little biology 101 should help frame the debate. %$* 483
about 98 percent of your dna is nuclear dna.it codes for much of who you are. %$* 483
but about 2 percent of your dna is mitochondrial which supplies the energy to your cells. %$* 483
to understand this, visualize a cell with its small nucleus and a little bundle inside of the cell and the mitochondrial dna and the fluid that surrounds it. %$* 483
the nucleus of the cell is where 99.9 percent of the action is, but only in the mitochondria functions properly. %$* 483
about one in 5,000 babies born have problems with their mitochondrial dna that cause rare but incredibly serious disease, including heart failure, dementia, blindness, severe suffering and death. %$* 483
there is no way to treat the condition once it is acquired, and it is extremely difficult to predict how severely a child will be affected. %$* 483
with genetic engineering of babies, we can altogether avoid this suffering. %$* 483
professors winston and krimsky will argue that we can just screen out and abort the defective fetuses or destroy the embryos in the lab. %$* 483
but mitochondrial dna, which is solely inherited from the mother, is often passed on to every child of an afflicted mother. %$* 483
only genetic engineering can safeguard a woman against these difficult choices and altogether eliminate the risk of a child being born with mitochondrial disease. %$* 483
take, for example, sharon, a woman who had a healthy pregnancy and who gave birth to a beautiful, healthy girl. %$* 483
twenty-eight hours later, that baby died of an unknown disease. %$* 483
this tragic tale repeated itself five times as each of sharon's babies lived for just a few hours. %$* 483
only her son, edward survived. %$* 483
and by age four, he started falling over repeatedly. %$* 483
he'll spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair with little control over his muscles. %$* 483
you see, sharon has lee's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease, and she passed it on to all six of her children. %$* 483
the only way that sharon or any woman with a high level of mitochondrial abnormality will have her own healthy genetic children is through genetic engineering of the babies. %$* 483
we'll talk about two techniques to do so: pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer that safely eliminate the risk of these diseases. %$* 483
at least 30 children have already been born in the united states using an earlier version of mitochondrial transfer. %$* 483
all of these children were born free of mitochondrial disease. %$* 483
and these newer techniques have even fewer risks than those earlier ones and promise even better outcomes for future generations. %$* 483
the united kingdom, notoriously conservative about reproductive technologies, has given the green light in the use of these technologies. %$* 483
a ban by the u.s.would make us an outlier, a country standing in the way of scientific progress, at odds with the scientific and ethical consensus that mitochondrial transfer, a form of genetic engineering of babies, is permissible. %$* 483
but mitochondrial genetic engineering proves my larger point that i want to convince you of this evening, that a middle ground approach is better than an outright ban. %$* 483
you'll hear my opponents talking about opening floodgates to a dystopia of designing perfect babies. %$* 483
but technology itself is not evil. %$* 483
only misuse and misapplication of it is. %$* 483
the public can and should decide what limits if any there should be on the uses of genetic engineering. %$* 483
but a complete ban would just drive the practice into back alleys or overseas. %$* 483
criminalizing genetic engineering will make the practice hidden from public view so that we will have no idea whether sharon and women like her are using unsafe and unsavory practitioners to carry out genetic engineering. %$* 483
reproductive tourism is already rampant, where women and couples are traveling to foreign countries to gain access to reproductive technologies banned in their own countries. %$* 483
you can be sure that women like sharon, afflicted with terrible lee's syndrome, will travel great distances to safeguard their children. %$* 483
now imagine just for a moment how we would enforce the outright ban that the resolution calls for. %$* 483
would we forcibly genetically test all babies? %$* 483
would they-- %$* 483
would the government appear in sharon's hospital room or at airports with handcuffs to arrest her or her child? %$* 483
would we forcibly sterilize sharon and her baby? %$* 483
is this the kind of society that you want to live in? %$* 483
some of the worst examples of abuses of government power in the last century have involved the government trying to control our reproduction. %$* 483
this grim history of eugenics and of laws against interracial marriage, of programs of forced sterilization and abortion, provide a strong reason to reject the resolution. %$* 483
we aren't here to defend every type of genetic engineering. %$* 483
we're here to urge you to vote in favor of a middle ground, to allow parents and private citizens to make private choices about one of the most intimate decisions they will ever make, to bring a healthy child into the world. %$* 483
thank you, nita farahany. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where the motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies." you have heard two of the opening statements. %$* 13
and now on to the third. %$* 13
in support of the motion to "prohibit genetically engineered babies," i want to introduce again robert winston. %$* 13
he is a professor of science and society and emeritus professor of fertility studies at imperial college, london. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, robert winston. %$* 13
well, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to hear my partner, sheldon krimsky, talking about the sperm of nobel prizewinners. %$* 482
we've got jim watson in the audience, and it's-- %$* 482
lovely to see him there. %$* 482
well, i mean, we should tell the non-applauders who he is. %$* 13
well, i know-- %$* 482
and we'll stop the clock for a second to do that. %$* 13
i'm not going to ask whether he's banked any of his sperm. %$* 482
what? %$* 13
i'm not going to ask him whether he's banked any of his sperm. %$* 482
jim watson is one of the discoverers of the structure of the double helix dna, if you read the book in high school in the '60s, he's the guy, and he's here. %$* 13
we're really pleased to have him. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome him for doing that work. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
and the clock starts. %$* 13
and it's the 60th anniversary of your paper coming up, isn't it, on the dna structure, which is a remarkable landmark. %$* 482
ladies and gentlemen, this is actually quite a simple proposition. %$* 482
and it's quite clear that what our opponents are recommending is something which americans shiver at, which is experimentation without the consent of the individual being experimented upon. %$* 482
it's worth looking very briefly at american history. %$* 482
the history of eugenics, which started probably in britain, with francis galton back in the 1850s, is still a scar to some extent on genetics. %$* 482
and davenport, of course, and other people who followed him, i think, had a great deal of responsibility for the sterilization of women without consent, with the prevention of people who might want to make love together because they were different races were prevented by law in many states in the united states. %$* 482
and this is something, of course, which directly influenced the nazi holocaust. %$* 482
and although it may seem farfetched, it's worth bearing in mind that the time when the planet is oppressed by the risk of global warming, and by the risk of conflict, by the risk of all sorts of serious issues on the economy, it may well be that people might want to see eugenics raising its ugly head again. %$* 482
and the united states, in my view, as the leading biotechnological country in the world, has a major responsibility to lead it in this ethical issue. %$* 482
now, as my partner has said, there are two concerns here. %$* 482
one is genetic engineering to change horrific genes such as these are mentioned, and the other, of course, is to enhance individuals. %$* 482
the problem, of course, is that once you go from one, i think you go to the other as well. %$* 482
and mitochondrial disease, let's just knock that on the head straightaway. %$* 482
mitochondrial disease, although it's a terrible thing to have, it is really trivial in terms of its incidence. %$* 482
it's a very, very uncommon disorder. %$* 482
and it is worrying to me that our opponents have got the numbers wrong. %$* 482
it isn't 2 percent of the dna, it's 16,000 base pairs out 3 billion base pairs. %$* 482
so it's a tiny amount of dna, but we know already that even fiddling with the mitochondria may make a massive difference to what happens to the nuclear dna.it's still not clear. %$* 482
and it's worth bearing in mind that abnormal children have been born as a result of mitochondrial transfer. %$* 482
this has been completely unpredictable. %$* 482
now, with regard to one of the issues about genetic engineering for enhancement, it will be permanent, it will be irreversible, and it may impart values to a child that, that child might find is not valuable in the society in which they are growing up. %$* 482
and, of course, with regard to disease, it is quite clear that screening embryos is a much better bet. %$* 482
if we take a cell away or the look at the biochemistry of an embryo, which you can now do, and detect the disease, we can simply substitute that embryo for another one in a clutch of eggs because, of course, a woman-- %$* 482
it's worth bearing in mind that the average childbearing woman watching this program will lose two eggs during the course of the program, each genetically unique. %$* 482
the males, meanwhile, have made some 70,000 new sperm. %$* 482
each of those are equally genetically unique, an every embryo is different. %$* 482
and therefore, to screen embryos which have a clear disease, by the techniques which are now being developed, is certainly possible and much safer than meddling with the genome. %$* 482
and, of course, what we have to understand is that we now know that the environmental influence on the embryo, the environmental influence on the fetus has a massive point, has a massive change, in how it grows up. %$* 482
and, in fact, really, what we should be trying to do-- %$* 482
rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what we should be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the dna functions in the best possible way. %$* 482
there is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, the intelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stress hormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning. %$* 482
and that is something which we should really recognize in a democratic society as something that science should really concentrate on. %$* 482
now, the big problem of course is that genetic engineering is unpredictable. %$* 482
and i'm going to give you two examples from the two biggest users of people who make genetically modified animals. %$* 482
the most common place for genetically modified animals, of course, is in the pharmaceutical industry. %$* 482
pretty well every drug is now tested-- %$* 482
nearly every drug will be tested on animals, where their genes have been modified to make a model for human disease or to look at the action of that drug. %$* 482
and if you look at the figures which are being published by two of the largest companies in the world, with very large series of mass models, you can see the problem you'd have with genetic engineering. %$* 482
astrazeneca published 51 different models, a vast number of mice in those models, 70 percent, ladies and gentlemen, of those animals were abnormal and the abnormality was unpredictable. %$* 482
some of the abnormalities were trivial, others were not. %$* 482
the animals were not followed up for long term, they were simply discarded, so we don't know what would have happened to-- %$* 482
in old age. %$* 482
we do know that changing genetics makes a difference to what happens to us in our old age, and certainly the fetal origins of adult disease are very important. %$* 482
we know, for example, that stroke, diabetes, some cancers, may be caused by what happens in the environment of an embryo early on. %$* 482
and pfizer has gone even further. %$* 482
it's looked at 74 different tests on mice that are bred after genetic modification, and 50 percent of the mice failed the phenotype test. %$* 482
and this is without, of course, testing the very things for which we would want to enhance people, i.e., intelligence and their ability to solve a problem. %$* 482
so let's just say one other thing, if i may, and that is that one of the problems, of course, is that one may modify genes, but we don't even know whether they will continue to function in the way. %$* 482
and there is a lot of evidence from the work we do in my own laboratory, which shows that gene expression in a modified animal stops after a while during development. %$* 482
ladies and gentlemen, as i say, you have a responsibility here. %$* 482
you have a duty to lead the world to make certain that your medicine is ethical. %$* 482
thank you. %$* 482
thank you, robert winston. %$* 13
and our final debater against the motion "prohibit genetically engineered babies," he is against prohibition; i'd like to introduce lee silver. %$* 13
he is professor of molecular biology and public policy at princeton. %$* 13
he is also founder and principal science advisor of genepeeks, a personal genomics company. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, lee silver. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 484
the proposition this evening is "prohibit genetically engineered babies." prohibit even if the purpose is to promote health; prohibit even if the recipients understand precisely the actual risk; prohibit even if it's safe; prohibit even if the technology is safer than doing nothing. %$* 484
i just need to convince you of one example of acceptability and you should vote to oppose the proposition. %$* 484
and my colleague has already talked very eloquently about mitochondrial dna deficiency, and i'm going to go beyond that, because i hope to convince my opponents here to vote for my side of this proposition. %$* 484
they've both written and talked quite eloquently about the use of genetics to prevent disease. %$* 484
so what are we talking about here tonight when we talk about genetic engineering? %$* 484
conceptually, it's very simple: genetic engineering will allow perspective parents to give their child genetic information that they themselves do not carry. %$* 484
that's how genetic engineering will first be used, not soon, but that's the way it's first going to be applied. %$* 484
and to understand what parents might want to give their children, we should examine the facts of genetics that have become available to us over the last five to ten years, have given us a very different perspective on the human genome than we had previously. %$* 484
and it revealed some unpleasant facts. %$* 484
i want you to look at the person sitting to the right of you. %$* 484
and if there's no one on the right, look at the person sitting to the left. %$* 484
that person and you differ at over a million locations in your dna.most of those differences don't do anything. %$* 484
but even if you're a healthy adult, at least 100 of those genetic variance can cause deadly childhood disease. %$* 484
not in you, of course, because you're sitting in the audience. %$* 484
but in your grandchildren or their grandchildren. %$* 484
you carry thousands of other genetic variants, every one of you in this room, that impact your health and risk to thousands of diseases in different ways, including cancer and heart disease and neurological disease. %$* 484
and some of the variants that you carry are better than those of your neighbor to the right. %$* 484
some are worse than those of your neighbor. %$* 484
and all in all, some of us are born with better health genes, and some are not. %$* 484
now, if you have made a decision, you or a daughter, granddaughter, have made a decision to have a child, what do you hope for the most in that child? %$* 484
and dr. %$* 484
winston has spoken eloquently to this question many, many times. %$* 484
you hope for a healthy child. %$* 484
you'll love any child, but you hope for a healthy child. %$* 484
and dr. %$* 484
winston has also said, and i agree, in pluralistic societies like yours and mine, genetic selection against diseased embryos is a matter for the individuals concerned. %$* 484
if you agree with dr. %$* 484
winston on this point, it follows that you should be willing to accept genetic engineering when needed to accomplish the same goal. %$* 484
but, you might worry, doesn't this violate mother nature? %$* 484
well, i'm here to tell you that mother nature doesn't care at all about you or your baby. %$* 484
throughout the history of the human species, mother nature has engaged in all-out warfare against us with infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. %$* 484
and it's only in the last century that we gained the knowledge and power to fight back with vaccines and antibiotics and other medicines. %$* 484
now, do some people abuse pharmaceutical drugs? %$* 484
of course there is abuse out there. %$* 484
but that doesn't mean that we should prohibit medicine. %$* 484
with infectious diseases essentially vanquished in our society, although not everywhere in the world, the next target in our sights is mother nature's genetic wrath. %$* 484
unfortunately, if you're in the audience, it's too late to do anything about the genome and the hundreds of trillions of cells in your body. %$* 484
but we can think about the future. %$* 484
you can think about your children's children and their children's children, because the expansive amount of knowledge we are gaining about the genome has flabbergasted even those of us who are most optimistic about this science. %$* 484
so let's think about the next generation or the generation after that. %$* 484
now, mother nature is a metaphor, and it's a really bad metaphor because in reality, inheritance is a game of craps. %$* 484
you throw the dice, you hold your breath, you hope your child is healthy. %$* 484
it won't have to be that way in the future when we learn how to take the genetic dice, place them on the table in the way that is going to promote health most likely for the child to be. %$* 484
what about the risks? %$* 484
we've heard about the risks from both of the proponents of this proposition, the precautionary principle is often mentioned. %$* 484
you shouldn't deploy a technology until all of the unknowable risks are known. %$* 484
and we can't possibly understand how genes work because the whole system of life is very complex. %$* 484
and if we put a new gene in, it might have unattended consequences. %$* 484
and i agree with the proponents of the proposition. %$* 484
we don't understand genetics. %$* 484
it's very complex, and it's more complex the more we understand it. %$* 484
but what society and people can do in the future is consider genetic information that already exists in some people but not others. %$* 484
i want to focus your mind on the fact, as i said a moment ago, we all carry thousands of genetic variants, some of which are promoting health and some of which are not. %$* 484
and even if a variant is in just 1 percent of the population out there, we can study the effects of that genetic variant in the people who carry that variant. %$* 484
and we can see the benefits or not of that variant. %$* 484
so the precautionary principle is not in effect here. %$* 484
i want to conclude that if you are thinking about voting for this proposition, you'll need to explain why you did so when your daughter or granddaughter comes to you with the following question: "dad, grandpa, why can't i give my child health-promoting, disease- preventing genes that other children get naturally? %$* 484
" if you can't answer that question, you must vote no on this proposition. %$* 484
thank you, lee silver. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
and now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies." we have two teams of two arguing it. %$* 13
the team arguing for the prohibition include sheldon krimsky and robert winston. %$* 13
they have made an argument, as i hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally. %$* 13
the scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field. %$* 13
it is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made. %$* 13
the crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive. %$* 13
the nazis fell for it with calamitous results. %$* 13
they're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now. %$* 13
the team arguing against the prohibition says, no. %$* 13
1, it would be-- %$* 13
the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the united states will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen. %$* 13
and in terms of the complexity, we just heard that in fact there is a way to find a road map through this forest by studying what is known already, what is observed in the population, that it's not-- %$* 13
that there's not a way into this-- %$* 13
into this forest and a way out of it again. %$* 13
so i want to put questions to each of the sides in turn. %$* 13
and i want to begin with just this broad notion of the u.s.being left behind. %$* 13
since we're talking about a prohibition, we're talking about, in that sense, something legal or regulatory. %$* 13
the side arguing against prohibition says the net result of that would be to leave the u.s.behind in something that is happening already, that this train has left the station. %$* 13
sheldon krimsky, can you respond to that? %$* 13
well, that's an all-purpose argument that you can apply for many things. %$* 481
we have all kind of moral provisions in the united states. %$* 481
we don't allow the sale of organs. %$* 481
we restrict certain types of uses of viruses in research. %$* 481
we prohibit certain experiments with animals that are considered immoral. %$* 481
we can always use that argument and say somebody will be left behind, but we have to establish moral principles and safety principles that make sense to our scientific community and our general society. %$* 481
thank you, sheldon. %$* 13
and i just want to ask the panelists not to hold the mic, because of vibrations are picked up. %$* 13
nita farahany, your response. %$* 13
it's true that this is an argument one could make in nearly any area, but it's different in this one because this isn't just that other countries are doing it. %$* 483
it's that other countries have studied it, they have found it to be scientifically and ethically valid. %$* 483
the u.k.has the human fertilization and embryology authority. %$* 483
unlike the u.s., things happen there with oversight, public oversight. %$* 483
this organization held a long inquiry inviting scientific and ethical input. %$* 483
the nuffield council on bioethics likewise in the u.k.looked into mitochondrial dna transfer. %$* 483
what they urged the u.k.to do is to green light this technology and go ahead. %$* 483
we are not saying all genetic engineering. %$* 483
this particular type has the green light. %$* 483
we would be left behind if we decide to prohibit it. %$* 483
robert winston, your opponent. %$* 13
well, it's nice to be able to answer nita firsthand, because, of course, i happen to be a member of the british parliament, the upper house, and we voted overwhelmingly to abolish the human fertilisation and embryology authority because it's useless. %$* 482
and actually it's inhibited research. %$* 482
it's not a very good way of regulating. %$* 482
so i don't think you should hold up the british model. %$* 482
what is needed actually-- %$* 482
what i think is needed is a consensus amongst all of us that we act as far as we can ethically and in the best interest of patients, whatever that might mean. %$* 482
nita, do you want to respond? %$* 13
sure, yeah, i also agree, we should act ethically. %$* 483
and the most ethical thing to do in circumstances where the only way to prevent a particular type of disease where we readily have a technology available that people will avail themselves of either in this country or another one is to give the green light to proceed. %$* 483
the ethical way to proceed is to study a technology, to have an open public debate about a technology, to have scientific valid-- %$* 483
scientifically valid studies that are allowed to proceed. %$* 483
this technology is proceeding. %$* 483
this technology can save lives. %$* 483
it has saved lives. %$* 483
we would be taking a drastic step backward. %$* 483
sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
sharon was mentioned. %$* 481
i don't know her personally. %$* 481
and i'm so happy that she had a successful pregnancy. %$* 481
but she had choices. %$* 481
one of her choices was to adopt someone else's egg and have a baby. %$* 481
she-- %$* 481
it wouldn't be her dna but it would be somebody else's dna. another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption. %$* 481
what is the urgency of people to have their dna in their child? %$* 481
in fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our dna, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that "my child has to have my dna." she did have some other choices. %$* 481
the risks that she took were real. %$* 481
lee silver. %$* 13
well, professor krimsky and i both have children here in the audience, so we-- %$* 484
i want to point out also that you two live in the same apartment building. %$* 13
we live in the same building-- %$* 484
and that sometimes you meet up for coffee downstairs in the shop, and you have this out quite a bit. %$* 13
we have coffee at jack's, the best coffee in the city. %$* 484
and i have no conflict there. %$* 484
and we both have children in the audience, so we've used our ability to reproduce to have our children who i'm sure that you love your children as much as i love mine. %$* 484
i don't think we should discriminate against those people who, for whatever reason, are unable to reproduce and say, "well, they don't have the ability, therefore, they should be adopting or solving other societal problems." i don't think that's fair because we don't ask ourselves to adopt, although a very, very few people do, so i question the alternative here. %$* 484
sheldon, i want to put a question to you, or robert, whoever wants to take it, that your opponents in their opening statements focused primarily on enhancement that ameliorates negatives. %$* 13
they mostly talked about helping produce children who wouldn't have dreaded illnesses, conditions, and diseases. %$* 13
before we get on to the other side of it about enhancing-- %$* 13
you know, to create pretty people and tall people, do you see the distinction between a genetic intervention to avoid pain and suffering as opposed to making a superman? %$* 13
i-- %$* 482
robert winston. %$* 13
i think it was a very clear distinction, and i think the other side are absolutely right to concentrate on genetic abnormalities because, of course, gene defects are appalling. %$* 482
they are amongst the worst kinds of diseases that people have. %$* 482
children in the main die of genetic defects. %$* 482
a few of them like mitochondrial diseases don't always kill people but they often have major effects on the central nervous system. %$* 482
they're deeply unpleasant, and there's no question that if we could avoid these diseases, if we could prevent them or treat them more effectively, we should do so. %$* 482
so do you concede that point to them? %$* 13
but i think the problem really is that, first of all, there will be enhancement. %$* 482
and i think that's risky. %$* 482
and the difficulty really is that in preventing one genetic disease, you're likely, very likely, to cause another genetic disease. %$* 482
the fact, of course, is that we now know that there are only 20,000 genes in the human genome, but there's a huge amount happening outside the genome which is of vital importance. %$* 482
the encode data which has just been published show that there are not just 20,000 genes, but literally 3- or 4 million sequences already known in the messenger rna, for example, which have an effect-- %$* 482
so you are not conceding the point that intervention-- %$* 13
no, i'm not-- %$* 482
i'm not conceding the point, but i can-- %$* 482
- what i'm saying is it's a seductive point and i can understand why they're concentrating on it, because the rest of the argument is bound to be very weak. %$* 482
nita farahany. %$* 13
there is no rest to the argument. %$* 484
our argument is that people all differ, we have genes that are different from each other in promoting or preventing disease and we think that, on that ground, parents should have the right to be able to promote health. %$* 484
but i also think-- %$* 13
the reason i was looking for clarity, i thought that i heard robert winston say that it's just not practical, realistic, to do these interventions to prevent disease because you don't know enough. %$* 13
and you specifically said this sort of intervention can actually promote other genetic outcomes. %$* 13
let's talk about that, the idea that if there is uncertainty we shouldn't proceed. %$* 483
well, i mean, i have news for you, which is every single time we choose to reproduce there's uncertainty. %$* 483
we have no idea how this unique combination of individuals is going to result. %$* 483
and we certainly aren't going to say that we're going to ban natural reproduction, which is no more sex and no more kids. %$* 483
that's not going to happen. %$* 483
instead, what we're going to do is we're going to ensure the scientific safety and efficacy of technologies before we allow them to proceed, and with mitochondrial transfer, which is a major form of genetic engineering, we have already had major scientific studies and an emerging scientific consensus that shows it's safe, it works, it eliminates massive childhood suffering. %$* 483
one out of 5,000 babies who have mitochondrial-- %$* 483
hey, nita. %$* 482
nita, just bear in mind that the children that were born after mitochondrial transfer are still children. %$* 482
and the real problem, of course, is what happens to them when they're adults. %$* 482
we don't know. %$* 482
we don't-- %$* 482
well, happily they get to become adults. %$* 483
they won't become adults without this option. %$* 483

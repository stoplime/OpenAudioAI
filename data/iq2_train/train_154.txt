so i’d like welcome to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi bob. %$* 13
how are you? %$* 13
i’m good. %$* 1
good. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so at "nightline," we've always said sometimes we work on some stories for months, and then suddenly the day we put it on the air, something breaks that makes it very relevant. %$* 13
and we say, "well, the news gods have smiled on us today." it's not in a happy way, but there's a real timing relevance to what we're doing tonight, isn't there? %$* 13
yeah, of course there is. %$* 1
there's a presidential address this evening, and it concerns obviously syria, where if there's any action taken at all, probably will involve drones. %$* 1
drones are in active roles now in yemen and somalia. %$* 1
so it is an extremely timely issue. %$* 1
so looking at this argument, these two teams we know have actually lived this in ways that they'll reveal very, very directly. %$* 13
some have sent them, and some have been near or close to the receiving end. %$* 13
the side that's arguing in support of drone warfare, actually, in our case, the side arguing against the motion, the side that is enforcing it and standing up for drone warfare, what arguments do they have going for them? %$* 13
well, i think their best argument is that it has been highly effective. %$* 1
it has killed a lot of terrorists. %$* 1
and it does it in a very precise way because these unmanned aerial vehicles can provide surveillance for many, many hours, days, coordinate with other forms of intelligent cell phone intercepts and really identify targets to a degree of precision that no other weapon system can do. %$* 1
so it's very accurate. %$* 1
it minimizes collateral damage to civilians, does not eliminate it. %$* 1
and, of course, it keeps the u.s. operators many, many thousands of miles out of harm's way. %$* 1
and the side arguing against it, what do they have to put forward here? %$* 13
well, i think their best point of view is that this just doesn't feel like conventional warfare. %$* 1
these are not soldiers on a battlefield. %$* 1
these are individuals on a kill list. %$* 1
they're targeted. %$* 1
they feel like assassinations. %$* 1
and it raises questions about the morality, about the legality, who is it that approves these targets, how are they vetted, how precise is that process? %$* 1
what are the legal safeguards around it? %$* 1
and particularly when the administration reserves the right to kill american citizens abroad with this program, it just shows how difficult and problematic the legal environment is around these issues. %$* 1
and the nice thing about our debaters tonight, none of this is theoretical for them. %$* 13
so let's bring them out. %$* 13
and thanks to bob rosenkranz for that introduction. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
thanks, bob. %$* 13
also, as i mentioned, because we are a radio broadcast, there will be a few points in the evening when i want to encourage spontaneous applause. %$* 13
laugh when we come back from breaks and things like that. %$* 13
i think you kind of caught it. %$* 13
if i give you one of these - - yeah, you all got it. %$* 13
i'm getting nods. %$* 13
well, done without any training whatsoever. %$* 13
and i also, at this point, want to just ask for one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz who really made this all possible. %$* 13
the u.s. air force-- %$* 13
it's the agency that makes pilots. %$* 13
and in one recent 12-month period, it made 250 of them trained up to fly bombers and fighter jets. %$* 13
but that is versus the 350 who were trained during the same period to fly drones by remote control, never leaving the ground themselves. %$* 13
350 drone pilots versus 250 traditional, clearly a trend that has good reasons behind it as the u.s.and especially the cia sends these riderless aircraft week after week after al-qaeda. %$* 13
but there's also a backlash against the drones and worries that the way we're using these weapons could come back to bite us. %$* 13
well, this sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we're at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
as always, our debate will go in three rounds. %$* 13
and then the live audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side can win. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." and let's meet the team arguing for this motion, but first welcome, ladies and gentlemen, ahmed rashid. %$* 13
and, ahmed, you are a journalist, you're a bestselling author. %$* 13
in your youth straight out of cambridge you moved to baluchistan in pakistan and became a guerrilla fighter and a political organizer for 10 years. %$* 13
you came home with fewer teeth and a case of malaria. %$* 13
you then became a journalist and before september 11 you spent some time with the taliban and wrote a book called "taliban: militant islam, oil, and fundamentalism in central asia." it was a book that everybody wanted to read after september 11. according to the new york times, when you wrote this book you, quote, "wore out welcome with the taliban," meaning that it wasn't exactly a fluff piece. %$* 13
well, that's not entirely true because there is and there always has been a peace lobby within the taliban. %$* 437
and they do talk to me still, but the hardliners, i agree, don't like me very much. %$* 437
and thank you, ahmed rashid. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
kael-- %$* 437
john kael weston, thank you. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john kael weston. %$* 13
kael, you are also arguing that "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." you had a very interesting and unorthodox career in the state department. %$* 13
you were there for 10 years. %$* 13
seven of those years you were in iraq and afghanistan but you were not on a red carpet inside an embassy, you were in the dust with u.s.marines. %$* 13
you were out there in the field more than any other state department officer. %$* 13
newsweek, kael, called you a "renegade diplomat" in part because of this style in the field but also because you had some issues in dealing with authority. %$* 13
so this debate, you're up against a general and an admiral, both four stars. %$* 13
are you a little intimidated by that? %$* 13
not really, not because they're-- %$* 438
not because they're not great gentlemen, but, you know, i got star struck my first year and then realized that i would no more rather be with people in the military than with the gentlemen across the table but i have to say, that being said, you know, ambassador holbrooke used to remind me what premier clemenceau said about war, which is "it's too important to leave to military men." if they're feeling bad about that, they just need to google what general jack rippersaid in response, which is even a better quote. %$* 438
so, thank you. %$* 438
all right. %$* 13
we're going to come back to you to find out. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john kael weston. %$* 13
and our motion is "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." and here to argue against this motion, two debaters. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome dennis blair. %$* 13
you are a former director of national intelligence, a retired four-star general in the navy, sixth generation naval officer in your family. %$* 13
you've commanded the united states pacific command. %$* 13
words used about you pretty often include often "cerebral, brainy, workaholic." you're fluent in russian. %$* 13
you're a rhodes scholar. %$* 13
but we've also heard that you once tried to waterski behind the navy destroyer-- %$* 13
which tells us what about you? %$* 13
well, you can be over prepared for the task at hand. %$* 439
thank you, dennis blair, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, dennis, your partner is? %$* 13
one of the wise warriors of my generation in the armed forces, retired air force general norty schwartz. %$* 439
ladies and gentlemen, martin schwartz, general martin schwartz. %$* 13
norton schwartz, you're also taking this position against our motion. %$* 13
the motion is "the u.s. drone program is fatally flawed." you're arguing against it. %$* 13
you have only recently retired as the u.s.air force's top officer. %$* 13
you were chief of staff in 2012 after 39 years of service. %$* 13
you got interested in flying as a kid. %$* 13
you graduated from the air force academy. %$* 13
as a command pilot, you have more than 4,400 hours under your belt. %$* 13
and it was under your leadership that actually the air force retooled significantly in the direction of drone aircraft remotely piloted aircraft. %$* 13
and i just want to know have you actually piloted one of the-- %$* 13
one of those riderless planes? %$* 13
i have. %$* 440
and interestingly enough, it's harder than it looks. %$* 440
it's not a cartoon. %$* 440
the interesting thing, ladies and gentlemen, is that you don't have the sensations of flight that you actually have in an aircraft. %$* 440
and it makes a big difference. %$* 440
so it's a different kind of pilot. %$* 13
is it-- %$* 440
well, it is a different piloting experience for sure. %$* 440
okay, thank you. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, norton schwartz, general norton schwartz. %$* 13
as we said at the beginning, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
and in this contest only one side wins. %$* 13
and we have you, our live audience, make that choice. %$* 13
by the time the debate is over, we will have asked you to vote twice-- %$* 13
once before and once again after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
and the way we decide victory here-- %$* 13
the team who has changed your percentage point-- %$* 13
your vote by the most percentage points will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go now to do the preliminary vote. %$* 13
you go to those keypads that are at your seat. %$* 13
and it's on the right hand-- %$* 13
right arm of your seat. %$* 13
you look at the motion-- %$* 13
i want to be careful, but there's kind of a negative built into this motion. %$* 13
the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
this is the team that's taking that position. %$* 13
they're for that motion. %$* 13
if you agree with them at this point, push #1. if you take the opposite side-- %$* 13
which means that you're with this team, push #2.and if you're undecided, which is perfectly reasonable, push #3.and we'll lock the votes in a couple of seconds. %$* 13
if you pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself and the system will record your last vote. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys. %$* 13
and then you stick around to the end to the debate. %$* 13
we have you vote immediately. %$* 13
and then within about 90 seconds, we find out who has picked up the most percentage points. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
we're going to close those out now. %$* 13
our motion is: the u.s. drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
onto round 1.opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
first to speak-- %$* 13
john kael weston. %$* 13
he is a former state department officer. %$* 13
he spent seven years in iraq and afghanistan as an advisor to u.s.marine combat units. %$* 13
he is now a regular contributor to the daily beast. %$* 13
he's writing a book, due to be published in 2014. ladies and gentlemen, john kael weston. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 438
and i want to say, it's great to be back in new york city. %$* 438
i was a resident here for four years, and i think it's one of the two most scrappy and resilient places in america. %$* 438
i won't say what the other one is, but you can probably guess. %$* 438
i also have to say that although our topic tonight is drones, i think in the back of our mind, we know that our nation is having a very important debate about syria. %$* 438
and i just want to say i'm grateful that we the people are leading our government on that issue, and at least we're pausing for a while, perhaps, before a decision is made. %$* 438
the issue at hand is the motion that ahmed and i are going to spend seven minutes each-- %$* 438
as well as the rest of the evening, of course-- %$* 438
we believe strongly that the program is fatally flawed. %$* 438
ahmed will cover some of the issues that i won't. %$* 438
we've divided the labor as follows: he's going to look at lot of the legality questions. %$* 438
he'll look at-- %$* 438
from his perspective in pakistan and all the great books he's written-- %$* 438
how much recruiting has actually increased. %$* 438
and contrary to, i think, some of the conventional wisdom, how effective and how targeted some of these drone strikes are. %$* 438
my points are going to be based on having lived in interesting places like fallujah, khost, helmand . i view my role tonight as being the ambassador for the people that don't get a voice on this debate, which are really the afghans and the pakistanis-- %$* 438
most of the people i sat across a table from and heard the stories after the drones launched the hellfire missiles. %$* 438
so, if i do that well enough, hopefully you'll get some of their voices, which is what motivated me mostly in this debate, is to not speak as a former state department official, but to actually speak for the people. %$* 438
so, it's not a headquarters perspective. %$* 438
it's not a state department official perspective. %$* 438
it's their perspective. %$* 438
one thing left out of my bio was that my mother is a fifth-grade schoolteacher, so if you'll bear with me, i'm going to ask you to do a couple things she taught me. %$* 438
i've got about 30 seconds to ask you for this, so, the first is show and tell, and the second is a pop quiz. %$* 438
i'm going to start with the show and tell because-- %$* 438
i think it reinforces, again, what's lost in the drone debate too often. %$* 438
this is a pakol, which is a wool cap that basically, the more rural parts of afghanistan, you'll see the tribal people wearing. %$* 438
again, i'm trying to give voice to these guys, some of my friends. %$* 438
it's a wool cap that kind of looks like-- %$* 438
i don't know how i'd explain it, but it's a pretty cool cap that's round and rolled up at the bottom. %$* 438
the-- %$* 438
worn by afghans in the tribal regions. %$* 438
this sparkly cap is called a kandahari, which is what i consider the next generation of leaders that you'll see wearing a lot. %$* 438
and again, if we're listening to them, what they tell us is basically that the drone program is undercutting them and undercutting their future. %$* 438
and then finally-- %$* 438
and i'll be quick-- %$* 438
i think i'm speaking on behalf of the front-line troops, because contrary, again, to conventional wisdom, this kevlar helmet-- %$* 438
which is a marine helmet-- %$* 438
i think represents those of us who dodge more ieds and dodge more bombs when these drone strikes actually don't hit their target. %$* 438
okay. %$* 438
the quiz. %$* 438
if you could pull out a piece of paper, my mom will be proud. %$* 438
or if you can take some mental notes-- %$* 438
i'm going to ask you two questions, and i think they're important questions, and they're relevant. %$* 438
the first is, after 12 years of constant warfare, which really started in the scarred city of new york with lower manhattan, what words or adjectives do you think afghans or iraqis or yemenis associate with the united states of america? %$* 438
nouns, adjectives, whatever comes to mind. %$* 438
and then secondly, what words would you associate with our nation, the united states of america, after 12 years of basically constant warfare? %$* 438
second question is, why is may 1, 2010, relevant to this debate? %$* 438
don't google it. %$* 438
don't use your iphones. %$* 438
but if you happen to-- %$* 438
if that rings a bell with you, we'll come back to it. %$* 438
the two case studies i'm now going to focus on in about the-- %$* 438
half of the time i've got left are one from iraq, fallujah, and a couple basically from afghanistan. %$* 438
in 2004, drones were not armed. %$* 438
they were eyes in the sky. %$* 438
when drones became a fatally flawed program is really the x that i'm trying to hit here. %$* 438
the fallujans would look up, they'd hear a flying lawnmower. %$* 438
the women would hang their clothes and get awkward and uncomfortable. %$* 438
the city leaders would come into our meetings and be irritated, but they weren't yet strategically against us. %$* 438
and, of course, this is the site of the largest battle of the iraq war. %$* 438
when did they become fatally flawed, and who did they become fatal to? %$* 438
i will argue, and ahmed will argue as well they became fatal to civilians, more than a few. %$* 438
and they became fatal, i believe, to all of us. %$* 438
in afghanistan, in early 2009, marine general larry nicholson and i were in a place called tagaz, which is basically the southern reaches of our area of operation. %$* 438
we met a bunch of marines who were alone and unafraid at the edge of the american military empire, overstretched. %$* 438
we all know the story. %$* 438
the next day, in the same location, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killed two marines and killed a corpsman. %$* 438
if anyone wanted revenge, i did. %$* 438
if anyone wanted revenge, general larry nicholson did. %$* 438
if anyone wanted revenge, the united states marine corps did. %$* 438
within a few days, we identified some suspicious looking guys who were near the area from above. %$* 438
two drone strikes landed a couple hellfire missiles. %$* 438
one of the men was killed right away. %$* 438
the other one was split in two. %$* 438
and we all watched as he tried to drag himself into the hole from the first strike. %$* 438
he couldn't hide. %$* 438
he bled out. %$* 438
he died. %$* 438
was it a good guy? %$* 438
absolutely not. %$* 438
but was he found out to be directly tied to the attack? %$* 438
no. %$* 438
that happens more than we'd like to admit. %$* 438
the next example is based on a new york times article that just came out on sunday. %$* 438
you may have read it, but i wanted to be as topical and as recent as i could. %$* 438
reportedly 14 afghans were killed. %$* 438
so i asked a friend of mine, who lives in kunar, what he was hearing. %$* 438
and he quoted a villager who said this: "may allah give me power for one day to use a single drone on the american people so that the american politicians understand how much it pains when a missile comes from the sky and kills your relatives in front of your eyes, and you can't revenge them any more." i've got another quote, but i don't have time to get there. %$* 438
in closing, i found a very convincing op-ed by a very senior former member of our government, highly experienced, wrote it brilliantly, brilliant perspective. %$* 438
and it was titled, "drones alone are not the answer.” and it was a new york times op-ed that came out on august 14th, 2011.he said, "the important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce al-qaeda's capabilities. %$* 438
they will not.” and i am pleased that he is on stage with us. %$* 438
it's admiral blair. %$* 438
and i look forward to hearing more comments based on the argument he made in the new york times. %$* 438
so i'm out of time, but thank you. %$* 438
kael, just for the-- %$* 13
our radio audience, can you tell them that you're holding up-- %$* 13
it's a wool cap that kind of looks like-- %$* 438
i don't know how i'd explain it, but it's a pretty cool cap that's round and rolled up at the bottom. %$* 438
the-- %$* 438
worn by? %$* 13
worn by afghans in the tribal regions. %$* 438
this sparkly cap is called a kandahari, which is what i consider the next generation of leaders that you'll see wearing a lot. %$* 438

so i'm out of time, but thank you. %$* 438
thank you, john kael weston. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." and here to speak against the motion in the opening position, general norton schwartz. %$* 13
he retired as chief of staff of the u.s.air force in 2012 after serving 39 years. %$* 13
he is currently president and ceo of business executives for national security. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, general norton schwartz. %$* 13
good evening, ladies and gentlemen and our fellow debaters. %$* 440
on behalf of admiral blair, it's a privilege to be here to address with you a very, very important topic. %$* 440
and, kael, i would argue that i'm representing the troops in the field tonight. %$* 440
and we can talk about the relative advantages. %$* 440
but i think it's important also to address the issue kael mentioned of the strike on sunday. %$* 440
it's important to know that that strike killed the individual who publicly admitted to kidnapping sergeant bowe bergdahl of the united states army who was still the only american service person who is incarcerated in afghanistan today. %$* 440
now, it may be that others were also injured and/or killed in this event. %$* 440
but i would argue that afghanistan is a declared combat zone, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 440
and under the rules of armed conflict, that this individual was a legitimate target and clearly a combatant. %$* 440
and he will kidnap no more american servicemen. %$* 440
but let me go back to a bit more balanced discussion. %$* 440
what i want to do tonight-- %$* 440
and i submit, ladies and gentlemen, that the employment of u.s.strike-capable systems is a viable and a rational response to a vexing battlefield problem, one that must be calibrated, used with care, synced withpolicy. %$* 440
but nonetheless, one that allows us to pursue our objectives in a fashion that minimizes loss of life for friendly forces and maximizes the opportunity to avoid needless casualties of friendlies; in other words, collateral damage. %$* 440
simply remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, permit more considered and more accurate and, as a result, more proportionate application of lethal force than any other comparable weapon system. %$* 440
because they can spend longer time over the target than equivalent manned aircraft, they give their operators the time to maximize the certainty but not necessarily achieve absolute certainty that they are engaging the right enemy combatants and that they have the time and the means to confirm the presence of noncombatants in the presence of the intended target. %$* 440
thoughtful observers like our partners tonight have mentioned a number of criticisms. %$* 440
let me talk quickly about a couple of them. %$* 440
one is that the absence of physical risk to the operator encourages our political leadership to use remote systems more often than they would if they had to put american troops in harm's way. %$* 440
i would counter by asking whether those who use this argument would prefer for the american military to absorb casualties just for the purpose of making war less numbing to the political leadership. %$* 440
in addition-- %$* 440
that's a tactical level-- %$* 440
is the ability of remote systems to maintain surveillance of target areas with remote operators carefully and deliberately evaluating potential targets against the criteria that allows them to shoot, that makes this system so discriminating and effective. %$* 440
soldiers and airmen under fire on the ground i think you would agree, kael, are far more likely to shoot back at the sources of fire aimed against them, with greater danger to noncombatants than are remote operators whose safety and lives are not at immediate risk. %$* 440
there's also a concern that nonstate or state actors will use these technologies against us in a more crude and indiscriminate fashion than do we. %$* 440
and well, they might. %$* 440
but the reality is is that this technology is proliferating, and not because we chose to use it. %$* 440
it is a fact of technology advancing. %$* 440
and our lead was and remains significant. %$* 440
so, let me go to a quick summary of some data. %$* 440
this goes back to 2011 in afghanistan during the surge period. %$* 440
there are about 150,000 air force flights in afghanistan in 2011.sadly, about 3,000 of those flights were medical evacuation sorties of our wounded, and our dead. %$* 440
compare that total to 25,000 close air support sorties and support of ground forces, your marines, of which 1,400 had at least one weapon release. %$* 440
so what this means is, is out of 25,000 sorties, 1,400 actually released a weapon. %$* 440
there were many sorties that flew with no weapon release at all. %$* 440
that's what a professional air force does. %$* 440
ready, finger on the trigger, but extremely careful and deliberate about applying lethal force in practice and in principle. %$* 440
333 of those 400 weapon releases were by remote systems. %$* 440
now, i ask you, were those releases-- %$* 440
the three quarters of the releases-- %$* 440
from manned aircraft somehow more practical, less immoral, less unfair than those 25 percent that were released by unmanned aircraft? %$* 440
i think not. %$* 440
thank you, norton schwartz. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed," and here to speak in support of the motion, in other words, he feels the program is fatally flawed, ahmed rashid. %$* 13
he is a pakistani journalist based in lahore and the bestselling author of several books, including "taliban” and “pakistan on the brink." ladies and gentlemen, ahmed rashid. %$* 13
the first thing i think to make clear is that unfortunately drones-- %$* 437
which is-- %$* 437
it's a weapon, it's a tool, it's a tactic-- %$* 437
has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is how foreign governments and countries where drones are being used see it. %$* 437
all the good of u.s.foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, et cetera, all are demolished when at the same time the u.s.uses drones. %$* 437
so in fact drones are undermining u.s.foreign policy. %$* 437
they become the only symbol of foreign policy which people abroad remember when they are-- %$* 437
when those countries in particular are targeted. %$* 437
and some of the countries like yemen, like pakistan are in fact allies of the united states and drones are being used against allies, naturally that is infuriating the population even more. %$* 437
secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the much more sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the u.s.in the last few years, where the whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive, development, et cetera. %$* 437
again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy being undermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, and they do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-qaeda. %$* 437
the other question which i think has to be agitating the minds of many americans is how legal is this? %$* 437
how legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not at war, with which nothing has been disclosed, there's no transparency involved, nobody is informed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again, taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the u.s.the lack of transparency is not helped by the fact that the cia has been mostly involved in using drones, especially in pakistan. %$* 437
if-- %$* 437
and certainly there's a move now to move some of these drone attacks to the defense department, but-- %$* 437
and that could increase transparency, but at the moment the cia's running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosen or whether killing these individuals are justified or not. %$* 437
now, what all this is leading to is an enormous buildup of hatred for the united states, and that is not just affecting people in the target countries but people all over the muslim world in particular. %$* 437
it's quite shocking to see the figures in pakistan. %$* 437
one poll puts 74 percent of pakistanis now hate the u.s.more than india, and remember, pakistan has fought three wars against india, and india is the proverbial enemy. %$* 437
another poll that i just read recently in chicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent. %$* 437
and here, as i sit, we're talking about a so- called ally of the united states. %$* 437
now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set. %$* 437
what happens when another country will start using drones? %$* 437
first of all, what happens if a european country, or russia, or a so-called ally of the united states uses drones? %$* 437
what is the u.s. strategy going to be? %$* 437
how is that going to affect u.s. foreign policy? %$* 437
are you going to slap that country down? %$* 437
are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, "no, only we have the right to kill people in other countries. %$* 437
you don't have that right."even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the united states uses drones? %$* 437
what happens if north korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill south koreans? %$* 437
what happens if al-qaeda itself develops drones? %$* 437
what happens if any-- %$* 437
if the syrians or any of the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones? %$* 437
so, what will be the u.s. policy then? %$* 437
are you going to go and bomb those countries? %$* 437
what is the u.s. strategy policy going to be? %$* 437
there's a complete vacuum here. %$* 437
there's no thought being given to this. %$* 437
but this could happen tomorrow. %$* 437
drones now are everywhere. %$* 437
drones are being used for all sorts of other, peaceful projects. %$* 437
and any of those drones can be bought on the market and they could be converted into drones that kill people. %$* 437
and i think that the idea that somehow, the u.s. is going to have a monopoly over this instrument forever is very short-sighted. %$* 437
i think the other thing that is-- %$* 437
that i must answer, the issue of civilian casualties. %$* 437
there is, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signature strikes. %$* 437
that is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in a group of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, drones are used-- %$* 437
can be used to kill that militant. %$* 437
but of course, they kill everyone else in the truck, too. %$* 437
women, children, men, civilians. %$* 437
now, the last drone strike, actually, on sunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilians were killed. %$* 437
and president karzai just complained to the americans. %$* 437
and they were killed by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of these people. %$* 437
i think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that. %$* 437
so, the fact is-- %$* 437
i mean, the issue of civilian casualties is very controversial. %$* 437
the americans do not tell us what-- %$* 437
you know, how many civilians have been killed. %$* 437
but estimates from other groups put the casualties in pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000.i mean, that's the level of inaccuracy that we have, because we really don't know. %$* 437
these areas are inaccessible or-- %$* 437
and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, the drone firer, that kind of information is available. %$* 437
and lastly, i think we have to understand how drones have been a recruiting poster for al-qaeda and global jihad. %$* 437
even local groups-- %$* 437
local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with al- qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad-- %$* 437
if they have been droned, they become global jihadists. %$* 437
they want to strike back at america. %$* 437
they want to kill americans. %$* 437
and that is really what is very dangerous, that more and more groups who are really fighting local wars and conflicts are becoming militarized and wanting to strike back at the united states and those other countries. %$* 437
ahmed rashid, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are in the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
you have heard three of the opening statements, and now on to the fourth. %$* 13
let's welcome to the lectern adm. %$* 13
dennis blair. %$* 13
dennis blair-- %$* 13
served as director of national intelligence and during his 34-year navy career, served as commander in chief, u.s.pacific command. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, adm. %$* 13
dennis blair. %$* 13
gen. %$* 439
schwartz addressed the use of drones in a battlefield area with u.s.troops deployed. %$* 439
i'm going to talk about the more controversial program, in which we use drones in areas in which we do not have our troops in action. %$* 439
and pakistan, of course, is the primary example that comes to mind. %$* 439
in fact, probably our motion tonight, "u.s.drone program is fatally flawed," is shorthand for "the american drones in pakistan have been a failure." and you've heard from mr. %$* 439
rashid some of the objections to that. %$* 439
i would tell you that there in fact is no independent drone program. %$* 439
the drones are part of a wider strategy which is dedicated to ending the threat from al-qaeda, a threat with which this city is very, very familiar. %$* 439
the policy of the drones, a tactic to an end, are to take care of the hard core leaders and fighters who are not persuadable, who are not going to change their demonstrated and committed intention to kill as many americans as they can before they-- %$* 439
before they can accomplish that. %$* 439
the-- %$* 439
a conflict between a country, the united states, and a non- state group like al-qaeda, is allowed under international humanitarian law. %$* 439
and that's what we are involved in. %$* 439
it began here almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago tomorrow. %$* 439
it has continued with al-qaeda's affiliates. %$* 439
al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula sent a bomber to try to kill a bunch of americans in an airplane over detroit. %$* 439
ttp, tehrik-i- taliban in pakistan, sent faisal shahzad a few blocks south of here to times square to kill a bunch of innocent americans if he could. %$* 439
we are at war with this group. %$* 439
and the leadership of these organizations holed up in places like northwest pakistan and yemen, places where the governments of our allies, as mr. %$* 439
rashid said, do not control their territory. %$* 439
it's worse in pakistan. %$* 439
they not only do not control their territory. %$* 439
they give permission to the united states to take action where they cannot, and then they blame us for doing it, which accounts for a great deal of the sentiment in pakistan when a dissembling hypocritical policy of pakistani politicians allows them to blame us for actions which they themselves permit. %$* 439
but they could stop us from doing it any time. %$* 439
and the government in yemen, by way of contrast, openly cooperates with us and tells its people that it does. %$* 439
now, the drones have been successful. %$* 439
we have killed most of the people who planned, who directed, and then who gloated over the felling of the twin towers, the attack on the pentagon and the aborted attack that ended in shanksville, pennsylvania. %$* 439
and we have done that not only with drones, but by armed raids, as we saw in pakistan, by a lot of cooperation with other countries and a lot of hard intelligence. %$* 439
so drones have played a key role in a successful, but i would argue first phase, of our overall campaign against al-qaeda. %$* 439
but what about the next phase? %$* 439
i think the role of drones in the next phase should be much different, not because the program has been a failure, but because the situation has changed, and the drones and other tactics have been successes. %$* 439
now the job is to reduce al-qaeda from a small-scale threat, which is where it now is, to a nuisance. %$* 439
and to do that, we have to undercut support for al-qaeda. %$* 439
we have to make sure that muslim mothers and fathers don't think it's a good idea to send their sons and daughters to strap on suicide vests and to kill innocent people around the world. %$* 439
al-qaeda is doing a wonderful job against itself. %$* 439
it has killed far more pakistanis, far more muslims than it has americans and europeans. %$* 439
but we need to help it further along. %$* 439
and we must do that by becoming even more selective, even more discriminating, even more careful in our use of weapons like drones in the future. %$* 439
and the great bulk of our efforts must be dedicated to helping countries like pakistan, like yemen, like mali, like the southern philippines, like somalia, like libya, like afghanistan, to make their lives better for their people so that they do not support those who attack the united states and their own governments and others. %$* 439
and this means that we need to continue to work with them. %$* 439
we need to train their security forces to do their jobs to provide security, to do it humanely, respecting the rights of the people. %$* 439
more than that, we need to help them provide economic opportunity, security, dignity, in the words of the arab spring. %$* 439
there will be a role for drones in that next phase of this-- %$* 439
of this long-term combat against al-qaeda. %$* 439
but it will be a more limited, more discriminating role. %$* 439
and the policy in the past certainly has not been a failure, and it must adapt to be a success in the future. %$* 439
and it's only through a campaign like this, ladies and gentlemen, that i believe that we can turn al-qaeda into just one more in a long line of terrorist groups that flared up, guttered, and then died, which is where it belongs. %$* 439
thank you. %$* 439
thank you, dennis blair. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is "the u.s. drone program is fatally flawed." now we move on to round 2. and round 2 is where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and me-- %$* 13
and from me as well. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing against this motion. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion that the program is fatally drawed-- %$* 13
ahmed rashid and john kael weston, the journalist and the diplomat. %$* 13
we've heard them argue that drones give a bad name to the united states, that they have become a negative symbol to many people in the world who live under doctor underneath them. %$* 13
that they are killing civilians as much as they're killing al-qaeda; that signature strikes are taking out civilians and that they're a factor that is building up hatred against the united states and working as a recruiting poster for al-qaeda. %$* 13

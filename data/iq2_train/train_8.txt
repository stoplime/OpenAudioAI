and it involves kids, and it involves parents. %$* 156
but it also involves people coming together in love, to care for one another. %$* 156
it brings families together. %$* 156
it knits the community together. %$* 156
and you would know none of that from their argument. %$* 156
in fact, professor eastman said a little while ago that the state has no interest in any of that. %$* 156
all it has an interest in is imposing his ideological view about biology and complementarity. %$* 156
well, i don't think that's right. %$* 156
and i think it's precisely because the american people have come to understand that that just doesn't hold up. %$* 156
it's not true that they've understood how it is unfair to sever out gay people as the one group of people who cannot get married. %$* 156
octogenerians can get married. %$* 156
sterile people can get married. %$* 156
people who renounce having children can get married. %$* 156
but gay people, even when they're raising children, under this view, would be denied the freedom to marry. %$* 156
and that makes no sense-- %$* 156
the mic is coming from your right side. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is sheherazade jackson and i am from a mixed couple. %$* 19
so, a hundred years ago, i would not have been able to get married, let alone my children would have had many issues. %$* 19
but my question is, are you saying the constitution can't grow and breathe with our generation? %$* 19
that was perfect. %$* 13
let's let-- %$* 13
let's kick that one around a little bit. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
you want to take that? %$* 13
sherif girgis. %$* 13
i think the constitution, from the moment the 14th amendment was passed, was big enough to say that interracial marriage is a fundamental right. %$* 155
at every step of the way, they have to allide over the difference between seeing marriage as a romantic bond where the other connections are by case-by-case, optional, by choice-- %$* 155
in which case, by the way, it does-- %$* 155
it's not very clear why it has to still be linked to romances. %$* 155
if two people who aren't romantically interested in each other, or if a single mom has her sister move in to raise the kids together, have they made their relationship oriented to family life? %$* 155
i mean, it goes back to this question, you know, the interests-- %$* 155
does the state interests change when the two adults aren't in a romantic bond? %$* 155
so, i think their vision can't explain any of these connections, but i have to allide over it, whereas the interracial marriage thing is straightforward. %$* 155
there's no way of reading the history and thinking this wasn't fundamentally about keeping blacks and whites apart, to keep the whites on top. %$* 155
and the court itself said that. %$* 155
here by contrast, again, it's impossible to look at the history and think the only purpose is to oppress gay people. %$* 155
kenji yoshino. %$* 13
yeah, so, i think that one of the reasons why we keep collapsing into a policy debate is that we're offering them the lowest level of review possible. %$* 157
so, if you're only applying rational basis review, you ask the other side what are your even conceivable justifications-- %$* 157
right? %$* 157
and so, that's why i think we're getting a lot of policy debate and policy questions, because they're producing justifications that are, in my view, inadequate. %$* 157
i want to make another point, though, about the equal protection clause, to be responsive to something that mr. %$* 157
girgis said, about how is it that organizations or cultures-- %$* 157
cultures, really-- %$* 157
that were very progressive with regard to gay rights, at least on the surface, nonetheless were opposed to same-sex marriage. %$* 157
so, he raised the example of the greeks. %$* 157
so, i would say, this often takes, i think, the more plausible form-- %$* 157
and that's not a knock. %$* 157
i mean, mr. %$* 157
girgis has made this more plausible argument of how can we argue that in this country, same-sex marriage was the bars on same-sex marriage were not enacted with any kind of animus, given that the gay rights movement wasn't even in existence-- %$* 157
can you give everybody-- %$* 13
the term animus came up earlier. %$* 13
can you just give the one sentence meaning? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 157
animus, then, is a term of art in constitutional law. %$* 157
it means "moral disapproval" of a particular group. %$* 157
and it is not-- %$* 157
simply moral disapproval of the bigger group is not sufficient in order to carry the day, with regard to justifying a law. %$* 157
and i would actually be interested in hearing both of my parties opposite. %$* 157
you know, i would be very curious to know whether or not you believe-- %$* 157
whether you morally disapprove of same-sex relationships, not same-sex individuals, but whether or not you have moral disapproval of same-sex sexual conduct. %$* 157
and i think that's a relevant issue because not under the animus, torch-wielding villagers, you know, "you're a terrible people," kind of thing, but just simple moral disapproval, which is the only constitutional standard that we need in order to cite down this ban, whether or not you have that-- %$* 157
why is it-- %$* 13
again, why is it relevant to what their personal views are? %$* 13
yeah, but let me-- %$* 157
let me tell %$* 157
wait, i just want to send-- %$* 13
why is it relevant what his personal views are as opposed to the constitutional argument? %$* 13
because i think that when you run out of arguments in constitutional law, what's left is the residue. %$* 157
and the way that things are reasoned out under rational basis review, is you ask the other side to produce all of their justifications, and then if there’s nothing left, then the idea is there's animus involved, a simple moral disapproval. %$* 157
john, we've offered lots of rationales. %$* 154
you disagree with them or don't like them, but that doesn't mean they're perfectly valid rationales. %$* 154
here’s what was said when the north carolina statute was proposed. %$* 154
moms and dads are not interchangeable. %$* 154
two men do not make a mom, two moms do not make a dad. %$* 154
children need both a mother and a father. %$* 154
now, i'm going to quote that other real radical conservative on the supreme court, justice ginsburg in the vmi case—professor yoshino earlier, “physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring. %$* 154
the two sexes are not fungible. %$* 154
a community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both. %$* 154
that's the critical understanding, this natural understanding of marriage, that it brings together the unique biological, rooted in nature complementarity of men and women for a purpose that is different than all of the collateral purposes we often assign to marriage. %$* 154
but the states' interest in furthering that institution for that purpose is why we are here and %$* 154
but, john, what about the gauntlet that was just threw down, asking whether you have moral disapproval, and that's informing your argument-- %$* 13
it's completely irrelevant whether i think gay sex and heterosexual sex are on a moral, similar plane or not, it's irrelevant to the-- %$* 154
it's let's say it-- %$* 157
it's completely irrelevant to the constitutional question. %$* 154
as it was, to what 6 million or 7 million californians voted who voted for proposition 8 thought about that question. %$* 154
the issue is under rational basis review, professor yoshino, as you under-- %$* 154
know the issue is whether there is any plausible explanation that is it rational. %$* 154
we have offered several, which you have not rebutted. %$* 154
and under rational basis review, that is more than sufficient. %$* 154
and, quite frankly, because of the compelling interest that the state has in fostering this bond, it meets heightened scrutiny as well. %$* 154
so i've given you one assumption, which is to say, right, let me say, heightened scrutiny does not apply. %$* 157
give me one assumption, which is to say now let's assume that, you know, i don't credit your rationales, right? %$* 157
so i just want a yes or no question, do you believe that there's something-- %$* 157
this is a policy matter, morally objectionable, about same-sex sexual conduct. %$* 157
it's completely irrelevant. %$* 154
it's a yes or a no. %$* 157
i don't care-- %$* 157
i mean, so give-- %$* 157
you can press it all you want. %$* 154
it's completely irrelevant to the constitutional question. %$* 154
we've reached an impasse. %$* 13
it's not going to get-- %$* 154
and we have also reached the end of round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." now we move on to round three. %$* 13
round three will be closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and immediately after that, we'll have you vote a second time, and your vote, the difference between your two votes will determine our winner. %$* 13
motion is, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." here to summarize his position supporting the motion, sherif girgis. %$* 13
you can sit for this one. %$* 13
sherif girgis, co-author of the book, "what is marriage: man and woman, a defense." ladies and gentlemen, sherif girgis. %$* 13
well, i think love and companionship and commitment and mutual care are valuable in themselves wherever they show up. %$* 155
here's a quote. %$* 155
"i understood marriage as the rare place where law and love converge."that's from professor yoshino's lyrical account of his own story in conjunction with a policy case for same-sex marriages, which is what his book on prop 8 is. %$* 155
it's giving you reasons for that policy. %$* 155
now, here's another quote and another view. %$* 155
"i've never been fully out as poly. %$* 155
i have to live knowing that someone i love thinks that if her mother knew that she has a second partner no love and support her, take care of her kids, it might lead to shaming and rejection." some people's innate personality means they would never feel emotionally satisfied in a monogamous relationship any more than a gay man would in a straight marriage. %$* 155
that's from michael kerry who had to write under a pseudonym in slate. %$* 155
now, maybe professor yoshino wants to say that if he's against polyamory, it must mean that he thinks these are sinners. %$* 155
i doubt that. %$* 155
it doesn't make any sense as an inference. %$* 155
they also want you to squint at the constitution and see that the constitution requires ratifying professor yoshino's view in his book but somehow leaves this one out in the cold. %$* 155
i don't see that, either. %$* 155
they're both policy debates. %$* 155
here's a third view. %$* 155
a woman who-- %$* 155
this is from a woman who grew up in a gay welcoming community by her own lights with two moms. %$* 155
she said, "i have a few fuzzy memories of my father's unfamiliar voice wishing me a happy birthday. %$* 155
wonderful memories with my two mothers. %$* 155
but one need they couldn't meet was for a father, not because they weren't good enough parents. %$* 155
i love a man i don't even know who, by all counts, is a lousy father. %$* 155
i ached for him to love me. %$* 155
promoting same-sex parenting guarantees that a child will miss out on her mother or father." that's heather barwick writing to the supreme court in this case. %$* 155
look, we're not telling you any of these is immoral or moral. %$* 155
we're not telling you that any of them is off the table, but they are. %$* 155
they're saying that somehow the constitution rules heather's voice out of this conversation, and we're saying it treats all of them on a par. %$* 155
thank you, sherif girgis. %$* 13
the motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." here to make his closing statement against this motion, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
he's author of the book, "speak now: marriage equality on trial." %$* 13
so i always wear a suit when i teach my classes in constitutional law. %$* 157
and one of my colleagues once asked why i dress so formally. %$* 157
and i said, "i think the law is an honorable profession." and he guffawed. %$* 157
and he said, "most of your graduates are going to go out and help large corporations beat the crap out of each other. %$* 157
so don't get on your high horse. %$* 157
why do you think this is such an honorable profession? %$* 157
" and so i had to think about why i thought it was such an honorable profession. %$* 157
so i went back up to my office, and i thought about it for a while. %$* 157
and here's what i came up with: were it not for the law, a life that would have previously been as unimaginable as the questioner who talked about her interracial marriage would have been unimaginable for me. %$* 157
at the time when i came out, i was extraordinarily fortunate that sodomy laws were on the wane and that i would no longer be deemed a criminal for engaging in sexual conduct with somebody who is same-sex. %$* 157
by the time i met the man to whom i made a monogamous life-long commitment to, it was possible to marry him in the state of connecticut. %$* 157
and by the time ron and i, my husband and i, decided that we wanted to have children, surrogacy laws and adoption laws made it possible for us to welcome first a daughter and now a son into the world. %$* 157
so whenever i hear people like my parties opposite, as much as i respect them, make arguments about how this is just about the selfish desires of adults rather than giving a maximum protection to our children, or that we're somehow radically changing the definition of marriage rather than fulfilling everything that marriage might mean, i always think back to my husband and to my two children and think that i have been completely deprived and inoculated of any capacity to be cynical about the law because every time i needed the door, to push a door open in my life, it pushed. %$* 157
and now we're at a moment where we can stop living under the equal protection clause and finally as gays and lesbians couples live up to it. %$* 157
thank you, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
the motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." and here to make his closing statement in support of the motion, john eastman, chairman of the board of the national organization for marriage. %$* 13
so 50 years ago, legislatively, we changed one of the core aspects of marriage with no fault divorce, and that's had pretty dramatic consequences. %$* 154
if you change an institution, you're necessarily going to change that institutions norm-inducing behavior. %$* 154
in 2012, the european court of human rights said that the european convention of human rights, their constitution does not require member state governments to grant same-sex couples access to marriage. %$* 154
and yet just last week ireland voters chose to do that. %$* 154
what we're asking here is that the same thing applies in our constitution. %$* 154
it doesn't settle this question. %$* 154
the question ought to be up to the voters on whether we're going to embark upon such a fundamental retransformation of the very purpose of the institution of marriage. %$* 154
justice kennedy himself, a year ago, said that "the respondents in this case," in a different case, "insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the voters." that is inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning government. %$* 154
he went further. %$* 154
he said, it's demeaning to the democratic process to presume that voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds. %$* 154
he says, "freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to engage in a rational civil discourse-- %$* 154
" we've had one tonight "-- %$* 154
in order to determine how best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the nation and its people." if we settle this through the normal political means, we will all have a much greater stake in the resolution than if it’s imposed on us by the court. %$* 154
abraham lincoln, in his first inaugural address said-- %$* 154
addressed that point. %$* 154
a candid citizen must confess that the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made an ordinary litigation between parties and personal actions. %$* 154
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. %$* 154
the constitution doesn't settle this question. %$* 154
we ought to let, "we, the people," do it. %$* 154
thank you, john eastman. %$* 13
and the motion is, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages," and here to make his statement-- %$* 13
his closing statement in opposition to the motion, evan wolfson. %$* 13
he is author of the book, "why marriage matters: america, equality, and gay people's right to marry." %$* 13
a little over a week ago i flew home to pennsylvania where i grew up to celebrate my sister's wedding. %$* 156
and after 10 years together-- %$* 156
11 years together with her longtime partner, she and patty were able to marry because we had brought the freedom to marry to pennsylvania. %$* 156
at the wedding were our parents, my niece and nephews, my brothers, my sister, of course, getting married, patty's family, our friends, their friends and family, and it was beautiful. %$* 156
in a few days my husband and i will fly home again to pittsburgh to celebrate my parents' 60th wedding anniversary. %$* 156
and i am quite sure that my parents, as we toast them and celebrate 60 years of love and commitment and joy and sacrifice and dedication, will insist on offering a toast to my sister and her wife. %$* 156
nobody's wedding took anything away from anybody else's wedding. %$* 156
nobody's marriage took anything away from anybody else's marriage. %$* 156
there was enough marriage to share. %$* 156
and sharing the rights that guarantees the joy, the love, the dignity, the support that our constitution makes affordable to all of us is exactly what our constitution requires. %$* 156
what our constitution does not require and does not tolerate is that we have to ask permission of others to share in the same freedoms, the same rights, the same dignity that are our birthright as americans under the constitution. %$* 156
the constitution guarantees the freedom to marry, and there is enough marriage to share. %$* 156
happily, a majority of americans have come to understand this. %$* 156
an overwhelming majority of judges now, who have had to look at these kinds of arguments and assess the evidence, have found it, too. %$* 156
and i urge you to do what we hope the supreme court will do, reject this discrimination and affirm the freedom to marry for all. %$* 156
thank you, evan wolfson. %$* 13
and that concludes round three of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages."and now it's time to learn which side you feel has presented the stronger argument. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and vote a second time. %$* 13
take a look at the motion-- %$* 13
we'll put it up on the screens-- %$* 13
"the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." if you agree with this statement, if you're with this side, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with it, you're with this side, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll lock out the votes in just a minute, and then we'll have the results about one minute after that. %$* 13
but while we're waiting, i just want to say, you know, john eastman said in his closing statement that we had a civil and respectful discourse here tonight, i agree with that. %$* 13
there's a-- %$* 13
you know, this is one of those where there is a very, very large, large gulf, and it can get very personal. %$* 13
and it did, but not in a way that was-- %$* 13
i don't think hurtful. %$* 13
it was respectful, and respect was shown by all sides to all sides. %$* 13
so i want to congratulate all of you for how you conducted yourselves and for the level of debate you brought. %$* 13
and, again, even the questions that i didn't take, i want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question, and especially down in front for your wonderful question where i had to stop you from going on. %$* 13
it was perfect. %$* 13
so thank you for that, and it was great to have all of your participation today in the debate. %$* 13
i want to thank also our partners in this, the national constitution center. %$* 13
we love doing this series and taking these constitutional cracks at these issues. %$* 13
and i take your point, this was one where it's hard to keep the public policy out of it because in a certain way it actually becomes relevant to the arguments that are going to be made before judges in any case. %$* 13
the program was also made possible through a grant from the john templeton foundation to the national constitution center. %$* 13
our thanks also to the foundation for that. %$* 13
and i want to thank everybody who bought tickets for tonight's event and would love to see you coming to future events and also visit us in new york. %$* 13
our ticket sales do not come close to covering the cost of mounting one of these debates. %$* 13
so, if you are-- %$* 13
if the spirit moves you, if you go to our website, iq2us.org, you can make a donation. %$* 13
every gift really does count. %$* 13
and it keeps us going so that we can do more. %$* 13
if you happen to find yourself in aspen this summer-- %$* 13
if you happen to find yourself in aspen this summer – %$* 13
i shouldn't read things straight from the card. %$* 13
if you happen to find yourself in aspen this summer, having arrived there by your private jet, we will be, i'm happy to say, partnering with the aspen strategy group on august 9th. %$* 13
we're going to be debating isis.and tickets will be available through our website again. %$* 13
and we're going to be back in new york for our fall season, which will include another debate partnered with the ncc, but that one will be in new york. %$* 13
and we're going to be announcing our fall lineup-- %$* 13
full fall lineup this summer, but you can get that on our website as well. %$* 13
so, i have the final results. %$* 13
again, the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is this the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages. %$* 13
on the first vote, 13 percent agreed with that motion. %$* 13
53 were against. %$* 13
and 34 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes the numbers most between the two votes is declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 14 percent. %$* 13
that was up one percentage point. %$* 13
that will be the number to beat, one percentage point. %$* 13
let's see. %$* 13
the team arguing against their motion, their first vote was 53 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 83 percent. %$* 13
they pulled up over 30 percentage points. %$* 13
so, that's the team arguing against the motion declared our winner. %$* 13
they argued against the motion the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages. %$* 13
our congratulations to them, and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

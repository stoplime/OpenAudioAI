well thank you very much, and welcome. %$* 1
this is the final debate of the third season of the intelligence squared debates. %$* 1
the very first debate that launched the very first season was the resolution, “we must tolerate a nuclear iran.” well three and a half years, almost four years have gone by and iran today has more influence in many neighboring countries than it had then. %$* 1
influences in iraq, it has much more influence in syria, it has much more influence in lebanon. %$* 1
it has supplied hezbollah with more and better rockets aimed at israel and it has made huge strides in uranium enrichment and the capability to build nuclear weapons. %$* 1
these developments all challenge vital u.s.interests – the nuclear program perhaps most of all. %$* 1
and atomic weapons don’t have to be used to deter threats of regime change or to deter vigorous response to iranian provocations like proxy attacks on israel or, in a possible scenario – interference with the flow of oil through the strait of hormuz. %$* 1
but we have to recognize that these developments are rational ways for iran to enhance their own sense of security and to project their power and influence in their neighborhood. %$* 1
so tonight’s debate is not really about whether we should communicate with a hostile iran, but what we should say. %$* 1
how can we plausibly induce iran to change course? %$* 1
what costs can we threaten or impose? %$* 1
what inducements can we offer? %$* 1
and finally, what role should diplomacy have in this process? %$* 1
we have a really outstanding panel tonight to shed light on these questions and it’s my pleasure at this point to turn the evening back to john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and given that this is the conclusion of the third series of intelligence squared u.s.and that robert rosenkranz started this thing and it’s gone into its third year now, i just want to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
welcome to another intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news nightline and i will be moderating the four debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the caspary auditorium of the rockefeller university in new york. %$* 13
two teams, two against two for, two tables will be debating this motion: diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 13
now, i want to make clear that this is not a panel discussion or a seminar. %$* 13
this really is a contest. %$* 13
it is a debate. %$* 13
it is a competition of ideas and logic and wit and possibly humor and charisma. %$* 13
we’ll see how it goes. %$* 13
but most of all it’s a contest of persuasion because these debaters are here to change your minds. %$* 13
by the time the debate ends you will have voted twice – once before the debate begins and once again at the end, telling us whether you side with the motion or against the motion. %$* 13
and we would like to register the preliminary debate right now, if you go to your key pads. %$* 13
once again, our motion is: diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 13
press number one if you agree with the motion, number two if you disagree and number three if you are undecided. %$* 13
and again at the end of the evening we’ll have you vote again and the team that has changed most minds from this initial position will be declared our winner. %$* 13
all right, we’re locking in the vote and we’re moving forward. %$* 13
and i just want to point out to our radio audience, because they cannot see the hall there, that there’s a little bit of a buzz about the fact that one of our guests is the former vice president of the united states, dick cheney, who is about four rows up. %$* 13
and it occurs to me, sir, by saying four rows up i may have ruined the undisclosed location rule. %$* 13
i apologize but i assume that we’re past that. %$* 13
so to round one, opening statements, our motion is: diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 13
our first speaker, arguing for the motion, liz cheney, is a lawyer and under the george w.bush administration, she was principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs. %$* 13
earlier in her career she served at the u.s.agency for international development. %$* 13
she was in poland, among other places, and curiously, liz, in a debate that is about diplomacy, you have done quite a bit of diplomacy in your time. %$* 13
well, don’t hold it against me. %$* 230
thank you. %$* 230
thank you very much. %$* 230
it’s great to be here tonight. %$* 230
dan and i are here with the task of convincing you why diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 230
and i think it’s important as we begin thinking about this issue to stop for a moment and ask yourselves, what is our current diplomacy with iran? %$* 230
what’s the current state of affairs? %$* 230
the current state of affairs is that the obama administration has privately and publicly offered direct, unconditional talks to the iranian regime. %$* 230
the iranian regime has failed to respond. %$* 230
so as of now, there is no diplomacy with iran. %$* 230
there are no talks. %$* 230
even if there were talks tonight, dan and i want to describe for you why it is that those talks, in fact, are going nowhere, and it’s for three reasons. %$* 230
there are really three elements that should be present in any set of diplomacy to have any chance for that diplomacy to succeed in preventing the iranians from obtaining a nuclear weapon. %$* 230
first, the current set of diplomacy of diplomatic outrage by the obama administration includes no threat, no credible threat of military force should the diplomacy fail. %$* 230
secondly, there is no time line in place that would prevent the talks from dragging on and on and prevent the iranians from using the talks as an excuse to continue to develop their nuclear program. %$* 230
and third, none of the very crippling economic sanctions that might actually convince the iranians that the cost of attaining a weapon is too high are in place. %$* 230
now, let me just be clear. %$* 230
dan and i are not arguing that force is necessary. %$* 230
we’re not arguing that military force is unavoidable and we’re not arguing that diplomacy itself is doomed to fail. %$* 230
we’re simply arguing that the current course we’re on is, in fact, a course to nowhere. %$* 230
now, as you think tonight about your vote with respect to this resolution, one of the really important things to consider, which the obama administration has not been considering, is the history of american efforts to reach out to the iranians. %$* 230
and i wanted to just run through for you tonight a few of the high points of that history, because any realistic effort to use diplomacy effectively has gotta take that history into account. %$* 230
in 1979 %$* 230
national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski met in algiers with the iranian foreign minister, prime minister and defense minister. %$* 230
and according to a note taker who was present in the meeting, brzezinski told the iranians, quote: we will accept your revolution, we will recognize your country, we’ll recognize your government, we’ll sell you all the weapons that we contracted to sell the shah. %$* 230
three days later the u.s.embassy in tehran was seized. %$* 230
two weeks later the iranian officials brzezinski met with had lost their jobs. %$* 230
in 1980 warren christopher negotiated the algiers accord with the iranian regime. %$* 230
the iranians agreed to take no further hostile actions against the united states. %$* 230
three months later they seized the american, seized new american hostages in lebanon. %$* 230
one year later they attacked the u.s.embassy in beirut and three years later they killed two hundred and forty-one marines in their barracks in beirut. %$* 230
throughout the 1990s the europeans threatened to impose sanctions if the iranians didn’t alter their behavior. %$* 230
the iranians did not alter their behavior and the europeans did not impose sanctions. %$* 230
in 1996 iran was responsible for bombing khobar towers in saudi arabia, killing nineteen american soldiers. %$* 230
despite this attack in the late 1990s washington decided it was time to try again, to extend yet another hand to the iranians to build a new relationship. %$* 230
we lifted parts of our sanctions program allowing food and humanitarian efforts, or humanitarian supplies, into iran. %$* 230
and the president and the secretary of state gave speeches essentially apologizing to the iranians for past american behavior. %$* 230
in response, the iranian supreme leader said these apologies were, quote: too little too late and did no one any good since the americans continue to commit such crimes. %$* 230
now, you can read a much fuller account of this part of the diplomatic history in ken pollack’s terrific book, which i really do commend to you, called the persian puzzle. %$* 230
you’re welcome. %$* 230
but to, to be fair, though, it’s not just ken who has been involved in failed attempts to reach out to the iranians. %$* 230
nick and i have also have our fair share of that, as well, when we both worked in the bush state department. %$* 230
2004, the european union iii completed the paris agreement with the iranians in which they promised to suspend enrichment activities. %$* 230
in august of 2005 ahmadinejad was elected. %$* 230
they announced they were continuing their enrichment activities and the russians prevented us from attaining any real sanctions against the iranians at the united nations. %$* 230
in 2006 we took the step of offering for the first time in thirty years direct negotiations if the iranians would give up their enrichment program and our european allies committed to imposing tough sanctions if they didn’t. %$* 230
the iranians didn’t give up the enrichment program and, of course, our allies wouldn’t allow us to impose tough sanctions. %$* 230
in 2007 the national intelligence estimate, parts of which were declassified, showed there is one thing, actually, that the iranians did respond to. %$* 230
although the iranians did continue to enrich uranium they did halt other parts of their nuclear weapons program in the immediate aftermath of the u.s.invasion of iraq. %$* 230
in 2008, despite the fact that the iranians had failed to meet any condition we had set for direct talks and despite the fact that they were funneling weapons and terrorists into iraq to kill americans, we sent our undersecretary of state, bill burns, to meet with the europeans and iranian representatives. %$* 230
once again the iranians learned that no red line is really a red line. %$* 230
to sum up this history let me quote from the man who was actually the note-taker at that first meeting in algiers in 1979.he’s our current secretary of defense, bob gates. %$* 230
describing this meeting recently, secretary gates said, quote: every administration since then has reached out to the iranians in one way or another and all have failed. %$* 230
some have gotten into deep trouble associated with their failures, but the reality is the iranian leadership has been consistently unyielding over a very long period of time in response to repeated overtures from the united states. %$* 230
in closing let me just say that the history of our attempts to reach out to iran offer us lessons about the three things that might actually work in terms of inducing iranian effort, in terms of stopping iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon. %$* 230
we’ve gotta have a credible threat of the use of force if diplomacy fails. %$* 230
there have to be crippling economic sanctions that impose a significant cost on iranian attempts to attain a weapon and we’ve gotta have a timeline so that the diplomacy doesn’t drag on forever. %$* 230
none of those things characterize our current nuke diplomacy with the iranians. %$* 230
and therefore, diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 230
thank you. %$* 230
perfectly timed. %$* 13
because we give each of the speakers seven minutes and that was six minutes and forty-eight seconds. %$* 13
huh, huh. %$* 13
very, very well done. %$* 13
arguing against the motion, our other diplomat in this debate, nicholas burns, who is now a professor in the practice of diplomacy at the harvard kennedy school. %$* 13
but for twenty-seven years he served five presidents, ultimately as our nation’s top ranking career diplomat. %$* 13
and nick, i understand that under the second bush administration you were the state department’s point man for iran but you were not allowed to speak to any iranian officials. %$* 13
how long did that persist? %$* 13
three years. %$* 13
well, here you’re free to talk as much as you want, as long as you’re within seven minutes. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nick burns. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 399
thank you. %$* 399
thank you very much. %$* 399
i’m delighted to be here. %$* 399
and thanks to intelligence squared for bringing all of you here for this important debate. %$* 399
i can think of no issue facing our country that’s more important to our future, more important to israel, more important to our arab partners than the issue of iran. %$* 399
and i thank liz for her remarks. %$* 399
it’s good to be on the same dais with liz and dan. %$* 399
they’re former colleagues of mine from the united states government, and ken as well. %$* 399
we hope to convince you tonight, ken and i, that actually, it’s very difficult to say that diplomacy is going nowhere with iran when we haven’t started diplomacy with iran. %$* 399
i have something to say about this and some familiarity about this. %$* 399
i was for three years the point person on iran on the negotiations perspective for iran for the united states government for president bush and i never met an iranian government official during those three years. %$* 399
with the exception of a couple of meeting in baghdad between – and these were public meetings – between our ambassador and the iranian ambassador to iraq there were no sustained negotiations between the united states of american and the iranian government. %$* 399
so we attempt, we want to convince you that we’ve gotta give diplomacy a chance. %$* 399
we can’t give up on diplomacy before we’ve started diplomacy. %$* 399
i think that’s the first thing i’d like to say to you. %$* 399
second, it is important to remember a little bit of the history that liz reviewed. %$* 399
we’ve had three decades of a non-relationship with iran. %$* 399
it’s the most unusual diplomatic or non-diplomatic relationship we have in the world. %$* 399
since the iranian revolution there have been times when american officials have talked to iranian officials but there have been no sustained negotiations on the nuclear issue and even on any other issue for many, many years. %$* 399
that’s not a situation that we should feel proud of. %$* 399
it’s certainly not a situation that advances our national interests. %$* 399
we have no diplomatic relations with the government of iran. %$* 399
we have no business community, american business community, in iran and haven’t for thirty years. %$* 399
there is no major presence of american journalists. %$* 399
so we’re in the extraordinary position of looking at a government that arguably poses the greatest challenges to the united states in the middle east and yet we know precious little about that government. %$* 399
so that’s what this evening’s debate is really all about: how to be tough minded-- %$* 399
and i certainly agree with liz and dan on that-- %$* 399
about the iranian government, but also there’s a twin challenge, a second challenge: how to engage that government sufficiently so that we have a much better understanding of what its bottom line is, of whether or not a deal is possible, about whether or not diplomacy can be successful in this case. %$* 399
president obama intends to begin negotiations this summer, probably after the june 12th iranian elections. %$* 399
my successor, undersecretary of state bill burns, did meet with the iranians once last year for a couple of hours. %$* 399
but the obama administration is about to test the proposition that perhaps we should have more extended discussions with the iranians-- %$* 399
not because we’re acting of naivete, not because we’re weak, not because diplomacy is feckless, but because it’s our self-interest to gather information along with the russians, chinese and europeans and see if there’s some way to maneuver the iranians, pressure the iranians away from a nuclear weapons future. %$* 399
i certainly agree that there’s a lot to worry about with the iranians. %$* 399
they are seeking a nuclear weapons capability that would change the balance of power in the middle east against us. %$* 399
they’re funding and directing most of the major middle east terrorist groups that are a problem for us, for israel and for our arab partners. %$* 399
and because of their proximity to iraq and afghanistan they are fundamentally involved in both countries and in a way sometimes that’s very detrimental to the united states. %$* 399
but the problem i have, and i think the problem all of us have in looking at this question is, have the policies of the clinton administration and even the administration in which i served, the bush administration-- %$* 399
have they succeeded? %$* 399
policies of isolating the iranians, policies of refusing to meet with iranian government officials, calling for regime change against iran-- %$* 399
i would submit that those policies have not worked. %$* 399
and the test of any american policy is not whether we feel good about them or feel good about giving speeches. %$* 399
it’s are they effective? %$* 399
and therefore i think that president obama is right to, to embark on a new path. %$* 399
what is that? %$* 399
it’s a combination of engagement with iran and also pushing back against iran to protect israel, to protect united states’ interests. %$* 399
and what would that negotiation look like? %$* 399
the united states, britain, france, germany, russia and china would be on one side of the table with iran on the other. %$* 399
we would be arguing that iran should cease and desist in its nuclear weapons ambitions, cease and desist in its support for terrorism. %$* 399
the only way to make that point effectively at this point is to stand opposite them and to engage them. %$* 399
now, i agree with liz. %$* 399
we’ve gotta be very tough minded. %$* 399
we’ve, i think president obama would be well advised to put a time limit on these negotiations so that the iranians don’t run out the clock. %$* 399
he’d be well advised to keep the military option on the table because that is language that the iranians would understand, and certainly well advised to say to the iranians, if negotiations don’t work we are prepared to put draconian economic sanctions on you. %$* 399
because we’re not gonna give up on this fight to make the middle east safe from an increase in iranian power. %$* 399
why try diplomacy? %$* 399
first, it’s the only way we will ever know if a peaceful outcome is possible. %$* 399
it’s the only way we’ll ever know if we can avoid a war in the middle east. %$* 399
second, we already have two wars underway in the greater middle east – in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 399
unless it is absolutely necessary do we americans want to embark on a third war? %$* 399
third, negotiations will actually isolate the iranians. %$* 399
it’ll put the united states on the offensive for the first time in a long, long time and it will actually increase international leverage against the iranian government. %$* 399
and fourth, we are no worse off if we try diplomacy because if negotiations fail we will be in a much stronger position than i was as the person negotiating with russia and china and the europeans, to say to them, especially to russia and china, we did what you asked, we tried diplomacy. %$* 399
now you need to back us in very tough sanctions against the iranian government. %$* 399
you need to put the weight of your governments behind the united states. %$* 399
we’ll be in a much better place to say that, to be convincing about that if we try diplomacy first. %$* 399
i don’t see how we can say that negotiations and diplomacy are going nowhere if we haven’t made a concerted attempt to try diplomacy first, backed up by a very tough minded american policy. %$* 399
thank you. %$* 399
thank you, nick burns, arguing against the motion. %$* 13
arguing now for the motion that diplomacy with iran is going nowhere, dan senor-- %$* 13
a man who i know put his own security where his mouth was. %$* 13
i know this because in the early days of the u.s.invasion of iraq i kept running into dan senor on my trips there. %$* 13
he located himself there full time to work as spokesman for the coalition provisional government. %$* 13
he is now considerably better groomed than he was during those, that baghdad summer. %$* 13
he is on the national council, he’s on the council of foreign relations and has co-founded the foreign policy initiative and is here to argue that diplomacy with iran is going nowhere. %$* 13
dan senor. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 142
thank you, john. %$* 142
and it’s good to be on this panel with liz and ken and nick, who probably all agree on more things than we disagree. %$* 142
but certainly on this issue there is disagreement. %$* 142
it’s also always good to be considering debating a potential conflict – heightened tensions in the persian gulf-- %$* 142
while in the heart of the upper east side. %$* 142
liz and i are really advantaged in this and it’s live on bbc, no less. %$* 142
i just want to pick up on something nick said, that it is hard to say that diplomacy with iran is going nowhere if it hasn’t really begun. %$* 142
i would say he’s right, the second part of that – that it really hasn’t begun. %$* 142
but it’s not for lack of trying. %$* 142
i think it’s important to evaluate not only the history that liz went through, in terms of the decades of efforts to negotiate and deal with iran, but also actually look at just the last few months and the signals that this administration has sent to iran, even before this administration took power. %$* 142
in 2007 and 2008, while this country was consumed with this fresh face on the scene – senator barack obama – so was the world. %$* 142
there was deep, intense election night coverage in the united states but also on al jazeera and al arabiya and the arab satellite channels and the different news broadcasts throughout the middle east. %$* 142
they actually covered primary, they have their own primary election night specials in the region – the best political team in abu dhabi coverage, or whatever you want to call it. %$* 142
and they were consumed with this. %$* 142
they were consumed with it for a number of reasons, not the least of which is so much of barack obama’s message was a clear rejection of u.s.foreign policy under george bush. %$* 142
in fact, in the democratic primary, one of his sharpest criticisms against senator hillary clinton at the time was that she was basically a closet hawk, that she would represent somewhat of a continuation of bush foreign policy. %$* 142
and the issue he specifically drew contrast with her on that was iran, because she had supported some tough sanctions that related to the iranian revolutionary guard corps. %$* 142
and, and obama called this a continuation of bush policy on iran. %$* 142
there is going to be change. %$* 142
and the american people overwhelmingly voted for this new face, this change, this rejection, if you will, which was a centerpiece of now president obama’s campaign – overwhelming voted and sent a message to the world that there would be a new policy. %$* 142
barack obama’s inaugural address with president bush sitting a few steps away, he issued some pretty sharp, very public criticisms while the world was watching of the former administration’s foreign policy over the previous eight years. %$* 142
he then in his first hundred days made good on his commitment on iraq, which is basically to move along some sort of timeline for withdrawal, which was a big issue for the iranian government. %$* 142
he has in recent weeks been very assertive about his plans for pursuing aggressively a two-state solution on the israeli-palestinian conflict – another important issue to the iranian leadership. %$* 142
he traveled to europe and gave a series of speeches in which, again, he almost apologized for u.s.foreign policy over the previous eight years and made clear that things were going to change. %$* 142
and then finally and most importantly, he was issued an unconditional invitation to sit down with the iranian government, in defiance, i might add, of three security council resolutions that call on the iranian government to halt its nuclear program. %$* 142
president obama is putting himself out there. %$* 142
he is really exposing himself by making such a clear and bold initiative for diplomacy. %$* 142
the only problem is, despite all this, against all this backdrop, the iranian government still has not returned the call. %$* 142
so it is true that diplomacy has not begun. %$* 142
but it is not for a lack of trying. %$* 142
as dennis ross, who is currently advising president obama on iran policy today, has said in a report that was issued by the bipartisan policy center late last year, if we have to chase the iranians to the table then any hope of diplomacy is off the table. %$* 142
we can, there can only be a truly viable diplomatic track if we can get to the table quickly, both sides agree that there is a real diplomatic process. %$* 142
at the moment we are chasing the iranians to the table. %$* 142
we are off to an unwinnable start. %$* 142
so i would just simply say that it is true that diplomacy has not begun but it is not for a lack of trying, which raises questions about where it is actually going. %$* 142
and finally, i would just pose the following question to ken and to nick: if you argue that it hasn’t gotten off the ground but it will get off the ground, the question is, what is your timeline? %$* 142
i commend a report to all of you that came out today issued by the senate foreign relations committee on iran. %$* 142
chairman john kerry of the senate committee hired an investigative journalist and hired a number of other journalists and former intel officials who actually traveled around the region to really get their own independent assessment of how far iran is from having a nuclear weapon. %$* 142
and the report was issued this afternoon. %$* 142
you can get it on the foreign relations committee website. %$* 142
it’s very clear. %$* 142
the time for inaction is narrowing. %$* 142
so if we say diplomacy hasn’t begun and we gotta let the beginning, the path to the commencement take place, and then we’ll consider how long the actual diplomatic process will take, is a tough sell, given the timeline that many are projecting, including as of today the most recent, the senate foreign relations committee. %$* 142
finally i would say the question that needs to be considered is, what is the nature of the regime we are dealing with in iran? %$* 142
if we believe that there is a possibility of diplomacy being successful, if that is our objective to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon on this path, what is the nature of the regime? %$* 142
is it a—one possibility is that it is a radical theocracy – in which case i’m not convinced they can be persuaded against a nuclear weapon. %$* 142
and if they are driven by some sense of martyrdom and some sense of inevitable outcome that is worth sacrificing their country i’m not convinced that they can be persuaded that they should not have a nuclear bomb. %$* 142
perhaps they’re rational and a nuclear bomb would bring them national power, it would deter u.s.threats in the future, it would cement potentially their hegemony throughout the region. %$* 142
and if they’re rational and that’s what this is about, i believe there are no inducements we can offer them. %$* 142
there are none that, no carrots that would be better than all that they would gain from having a nuclear bomb. %$* 142
so if we are going to pursue some sort of diplomatic path it must have a real timeline that is narrow and it must be backed up by a very credible threat of military force and a very credible threat of crippling sanctions and a real clearly defined publicly available trigger point for those actions to take place. %$* 142
thank you. %$* 142
thank you, dan senor. %$* 13
and finally, arguing against the motion that diplomacy with iran is going nowhere, ken pollack, whose point of agreement with dan senor back in 2002 was his book, threatening storm, which argued for the toppling of the saddam hussein regime. %$* 13
since then he has written about iran, arguing for negotiations and his most recent book, a path out of the desert: a grand strategy for america in the middle east, makes the same point – and i must say, ‘cause i’ve read it, is a terrific read. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ken pollack. %$* 13
thank you all. %$* 400
it’s wonderful to be here. %$* 400
thank you, john, and liz also, for the plugs for my books. %$* 400
i can’t appreciate that enough. %$* 400
i promise to get you a check later on. %$* 400
and it is wonderful to be up here with my friends, with dan, with liz, with nick, debating a very important topic. %$* 400
i thought i’d start where nick left off. %$* 400
i thought i’d start by talking a little bit about the potential for a peaceful resolution. %$* 400
and we need to recognize that there is the prospect. %$* 400
we don’t know – and i say this as someone who has studied iran for over two decades – at the cia, at the department of defense, at the national security council and the think tank world. %$* 400
we don’t really know what the iranians want. %$* 400
we don’t really know what they’d be willing to give. %$* 400
and in direct answer to dan’s question of what might it take. %$* 400
why have they not taken the choice already? %$* 400
well, we haven’t put the choice to them directly. %$* 400
the choice that we need to put to them is a very simple one. %$* 400
you get to have a good, thriving economy which is ultimately what the people of iran want or you get a nuclear weapon. %$* 400
but you don’t get both. %$* 400
the critical thing that you need to keep in mind – and i don’t think that liz and dan necessarily disagree with that-- %$* 400
but the critical thing that you need to get, keep in mind is how we get to that choice, how we force the iranians to recognize that they get to have one or the other, not both. %$* 400
they don’t get to have their cake and eat it, too. %$* 400
i agree that this regime in iran is not yet ready to sit down and compromise with us. %$* 400
i think they’ve made a tactical decision to talk to us. %$* 400
they have not made the strategic decision to compromise with us. %$* 400
and so the question becomes, how do we get them to that point? %$* 400
well, as liz very nicely described, we tried, when i was first in the clinton white house, at the nsc, working on iran. %$* 400
it was 1995-96, the period when the clinton administration, of which i was a part and working on iran, imposed comprehensive unilateral sanctions against iran. %$* 400
and these sanctions hurt. %$* 400
do not believe for a second that those sanctions were meaningless. %$* 400
they hurt iran and they hurt iran to this day. %$* 400
but they haven’t hurt iran enough to force them to make that choice, to make it the way that we want them to. %$* 400
later on we tried in 1998-99, my second time in the white house, to bring the rest of the world on board because we recognized that the only way to put that kind of pressure on the iranians was to get the support of the world, to get them on board with the same kind of sanctions which could inflict the kind of pain on the iranians that would force them to make that choice, the choice that they’re trying to avoid. %$* 400
and what we found was that the rest of the world wasn’t ready. %$* 400
and nick and liz tried the same thing during the bush administration and they found the same thing. %$* 400
and what we consistently heard over and over and over again was, you have not made a good faith effort with the iranians. %$* 400
you’ve not put a deal on the table that they might accept, you have not given them a chance to say yes. %$* 400
now we can debate about whether that’s true or not, but the simple fact is, that’s what the rest of the world believes. %$* 400
and until we convince them otherwise, they’re not gonna join us in imposing harsher sanctions on iran, the kind of sanctions that might force the iranians to come to that decision. %$* 400
now the second thing that i wanna do, is to talk a little bit about what happens if we stop the diplomacy. %$* 400
because we do need to think about that, it’s the elephant in the living room. %$* 400
if we’re not talking to iran we’ve gotta be doing something else. %$* 400
and as i said, unilateral sanctions, no matter how clever both the clinton and bush administrations were in imposing unilateral sanctions, those don’t seem to be enough. %$* 400
and so if those aren’t gonna be enough, and we’re not gonna try to diplomacy, that is the one way that we might be able to get international support for the kind of harsh sanctions on iran that might change their mind, well, alternatives start to look a lot worse. %$* 400
and i say that as someone who is very realistic about the chances of diplomacy with iran. %$* 400
i could add, nick could as well, a half- dozen other problems to the ones that liz and dan have already mentioned. %$* 400
okay, we’ve been through it, we know how hard it is to deal with the iranians. %$* 400
but the simple fact is, that diplomacy is much better than any of the other options, all the options stink. %$* 400
but some of ‘em stink a lot worse than others. %$* 400
option one, we could do nothing. %$* 400
we could sit back and try to contain the iranians, and deter them once they’ve got nuclear weapons. %$* 400
i don’t know about the rest of you, but that’s a social-science experiment i’d prefer not to run. %$* 400
okay? %$* 400
we don’t know what the iranians will do when they have a nuclear weapon, i tend to doubt they’d actually use it, but i’m not certain, and i wouldn’t want to find out that i was wrong. %$* 400
and even if i am right about it, we’re going to face an aggressive iran, one that is going to be much more willing to support its terrorist allies, all across the middle east. %$* 400
the last thing that the middle east needs is more trouble, more instability, more iranian-assisted troublemaking in the region, and that’s exactly what we get, if we allow them to have the nuclear weapon. %$* 400
another alternative is regime change. %$* 400
we go in there and we decided we’re gonna get rid of the governments. %$* 400
and the way that people typically think about regime change in iran is, we’re gonna spark a popular revolution. %$* 400
and people say that because the truth is that as best we can tell most iranians don’t really like their government, and they’d like to see it changed. %$* 400
the problem with this is, that revolutions are very unpredictable, and they’re very rare. %$* 400
and we don’t really know how to get one started in iran. %$* 400
and beyond that, we have what’s called, what i call the groucho marx problem. %$* 400
that every—remember groucho once famously said that, he wouldn’t wanna be a member of any club that would have him as a member? %$* 400
well, every iranian oppositionist who accepts money from the united states of america, is totally not someone we should be giving money to. %$* 400
‘cause they probably work for the iranian intelligence services, and they probably don’t have any support among the iranian people, because since 1953, when we overthrew mossadegh, we have been the third rail of iranian politics. %$* 400
and the last option that’s out there, and i don’t think anyone on the panel is arguing for this but let’s remember it, is war. %$* 400
okay. %$* 400
we can try airstrikes against the iranian nuclear program. %$* 400
but don’t think that this is gonna be a quick surgical strike. %$* 400
okay, the iranian program is big, it is dispersed, it is hardened. %$* 400
it is going to require hundreds if not thousands of sorties, to take down that program. %$* 400
and most of the intelligence people i’ve spoken to including the israelis, believe that even a wildly successful strike would probably only set the program back by one or two, maybe if we got really lucky, three or four years. %$* 400
and the iranians will retaliate. %$* 400
and they will rebuild. %$* 400
and we will have to strike again. %$* 400
okay. %$* 400
this will not be a surgical operation, it will as nick said, be an open-ended war. %$* 400
another open-ended war in the middle east. %$* 400
these are all paths that we may have to confront at some point in time, but i’d suggest to you that we shouldn’t do so, until we have made sure that there is no diplomatic solution. %$* 400
we’re not there yet. %$* 400
and let’s just remember, the very wise words of franklin roosevelt, a man who was determined to wage world war ii because he knew it was the right thing to do. %$* 400
but who famously once said, that jaw- jaw is better than war-war. %$* 400
thank you. %$* 400
thank you, ken pollack. %$* 13
this is an intelligence squared debate, i’m john donvan, your moderator, we have two teams of two members each, debating this motion, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere.” and we’re gonna now reveal the %$* 13
debate— the vote numbers, we ready with those? %$* 13
do i have them in my hand—okay. %$* 13
as you recall when you came in you were asked to vote on the motion, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere” %$* 13
you pushed 1 if you were for, 2 if you were against and 3 otherwise. %$* 13
it’s a three- way split. %$* 13
34 percent are for the motion— 33 percent against, and 33 percent undecided. %$* 13
and, reminding you that the way we predict—the way we call victory is the team that moves the most minds during the course of an evening and so it’s really a horserace at this point. %$* 13
on to round two, and in round two, the debaters address one another, they take questions from you the audience and also questions from me. %$* 13
i wanna begin with this, it seems as though we have a very basic disagreement on the facts when we hear liz cheney talk about repeated overtures, and nick burns arguing against the motion, saying that there has been no diplomacy, there is no diplomacy with iran. %$* 13
well i think i said that, you know, since 1979-80, there’ve been lots of individual meetings, i think between americans and iranians, i think every administration has done that. %$* 399
but why is that not diplomacy— %$* 13
there have been no— that’s not diplomacy. %$* 399
that’s not what we mean by diplomacy. %$* 399
there have been no sustained discussions on the nuclear issue, which is the most important issue. %$* 399
take %$* 399
my example. %$* 399
i served in the clinton administration, and i served in the bush administration. %$* 399
in the bush administration i had the responsibility for trying to put those negotiations together. %$* 399
and we were not able to do that, we didn’t meet with anybody, we didn’t have extended discussions with the iranians, we never got in the room with them, in a meaningful way. %$* 399
that’s what diplomacy is. %$* 399
it’s actually trying to figure out what the other side is up to, what their bottom line is, seeing if it’s right for us, and smart for us to make a deal. %$* 399
and i just pose the following question based on that. %$* 399
if you’re not for diplomacy now, and if you wanna give up on diplomacy which is the position of liz and dan, then what are you for. %$* 399
you can’t say you’re not for war. %$* 399
because you’ll then leave president obama with one option—to go to war, you’ll have no credibility to go to sanctions, as ken said. %$* 399
if we leave the diplomatic field right now, the europeans, the russians and chinese will not support us on sanctions. %$* 399
you’re leaving president obama with one choice. %$* 399
go to war, third war %$* 399
liz cheney— %$* 13
—for the united states of america in the middle east. %$* 399
liz cheney. %$* 13
well i think first of all, nick is mischaracterizing dan’s and my view on this, dan and i are not arguing that we should abandon diplomacy or that we should not undertake diplomacy. %$* 230
dan and i are simply arguing that the current diplomacy is going nowhere, and it’s going nowhere because it’s flawed diplomacy. %$* 230
now, discussing this issue with nick, you know, i feel a little bit like alice in wonderland here, because nick and i sat in many of the same meetings over the course of a number of years, and, saying that we didn’t have diplomacy because we didn’t have sustained discussions completely ignores the fact that it was the iranians who made that choice in many, many instances. %$* 230
and i went through in the beginning of the talk the extent to which the united states government has over 30 years attempted again and again and again, including our national security advisor sitting with the iranian prime minister and saying, we will sell you weapons, we will recognize your country, we’ll recognize your revolution. %$* 230
and the iranians walk away from the table time and time again. %$* 230
now i think this gets to a very fundamental point that dan made which is, what is iran, what is the nature of that regime. %$* 230
and part of the problem with the current diplomacy, the reason why i believe—one of the reasons i believe it’s going nowhere is because there’s a fundamental misunderstanding, about the nature of the regime. %$* 230
you know, president obama makes—gives a norouz message to the iranian people but also to the regime and he talks about things like common hopes, and common dreams. %$* 230
i don’t believe that we have any common hopes or dreams with the supreme leader in iran. %$* 230
i don’t, i think the supreme leader in iran believes in exporting terrorism, he believes in exporting his islamic revolution, and i think that, you know, at the end of the day, you’ve gotta ask yourself, you know, as kissinger was asked, is iran a country, or are they a cause, if iran is a cause, if they are a hegemonic, revolutionary, terrorist, extremist power, and they’re attempting to gain a nuclear weapon, then we are being dangerously naïve and irresponsible to pretend that we have now history here of trying to talk to them— %$* 230
let me bring in the other side? %$* 13
nick burns. %$* 13
it’s important to note that this famous meeting that liz has now cited twice took place 30 years ago. %$* 399
not exactly in modern times. %$* 399
i’d also say this in defense of president obama. %$* 399
i’m impressed by him, i’m someone who’s not a republican, i’m not a democrat. %$* 399
i’m not a political person. %$* 399
i think he’s actually outpointing the iranians. %$* 399
he’s put them on a defensive. %$* 399
that norouz message was not to the supreme leader. %$* 399
it was to the iranian people. %$* 399
and i think it’s— it makes a lot of sense. %$* 399
it makes a lot of sense to stretch out a hand, to the iranian people, over this chasm of three decades—what has president obama done? %$* 399
the norouz message. %$* 399
he invited iran to a un conference on afghanistan. %$* 399
he said that the united states for the first time would join these negotiations unconditionally which i happen to think is the right thing to do right now. %$* 399
because our prior policy didn’t work. %$* 399
with the iranians. %$* 399
and so therefore, it’s hard to argue that diplomacy’s going nowhere when president obama’s taken baby steps to put us maybe into the first phase of diplomacy. %$* 399
i would submit that we’ve all gotta give him at least six months to try diplomacy— %$* 399
dan— %$* 13
—before we denounce it— %$* 399
dan senor. %$* 13
can i just ask a question—or go—go ahead. %$* 142
i just wanna make one quick point which is that our opponents need to decide what their position is. %$* 230
their position is either, diplomacy hasn’t started, which is what they both argued when they made their opening presentation, it hasn’t started, it’s gonna start this summer, give it some time. %$* 230
or their position is, well, diplomacy has sort of started with some baby steps. %$* 230
or their position has gotta be, you know, look, it’s started and the iranians have responded well, you know, they gotta choose one of those. %$* 230
but i would say that, that at the end of the day what we’ve seen actually is the administration has attempted to reach out a hand, the iranians have not responded and there’s a report this afternoon, uh, out of the jerusalem post that the iranians are actually basing missiles now along the straits of hormuz. %$* 230
ken pollack, your—your opponent’s calling for clarify on your position. %$* 13
yeah, look, i think that to say, have they started yet or are they just taking baby steps, it’s a difference without real substance there. %$* 400
i think the point that we’re trying to get at here though is that, we don’t really know what the iranian position is. %$* 400
and more importantly still, the diplomacy is about more than just iran. %$* 400
in fact the most important object of our diplomacy, are as nick was suggesting, as i suggested, our european allies, our east asian allies, the russians, the chinese, everyone else who is probably going to have to come onboard, before the iranians realize that they’ve gotta make a serious decision— %$* 400
but is—isn’t that diplomacy about iran as opposed to diplomacy— %$* 13
correct, that is— %$* 400
—with iran which is— %$* 13
that’s exactly—well, but both of them are interlocking. %$* 400
because the rest of the world is not interested in us only having diplomacy with them, without also trying to engage the iranians. %$* 400
that’s what they want. %$* 400
that’s the carrot for them. %$* 400
and in return, we’re trying to get them to sign up for the stick. %$* 400
liz, i—if you, can you come a little closer to the mic— %$* 13
yeah, i just wanna—you know %$* 230
actually it’s not fair to say the rest of the world wants us to talk to iran. %$* 230
i think that you’ve actually got a situation now, you saw it during the election, where you had the british for example act, you know, demonstrate extreme nervousness with the notion that suddenly the united states was offering direct, unconditional talks, which is basically leaving our european allies aside. %$* 230
our european allies have been with us in the european union iii, we’ve been working on a multilateral course for diplomacy, direct talks cuts them out of the picture. %$* 230
we haven’t even talked about our arab allies, and the notion that the arab nations today want us to talk to iran, you know, is a fallacy. %$* 230
what we’re hearing from government after government after government, is that they are very nervous, they believe the united states is about to make deals with iran, and so they are now thinking do we need to make our own deals %$* 230
you know, their concern is so great that we’ve sent our secretary of defense out to calm ‘em down, so the idea that the rest of the world wants us to talk to iran, fundamentally mischaracterizes the danger of this new openness and this unconditional— %$* 230
liz, i don’t— %$* 399
ken pollack— %$* 13
disagreement here, and the— %$* 399
all right, i’m— %$* 13
the fundamental disagreement i think— %$* 399
—i’m, just to clarify, nick burns— %$* 13
—that i certainly have with liz is that i spent most of my time between 2005 and 2008 shuttling to paris and london and moscow, and beijing on this question. %$* 399
those partners of ours want us to have talks with iran. %$* 399
they have accepted i think, i know they’ve accepted, that now we should do it unconditionally. %$* 399
we— when we conditioned in 2006, our entry into negotiations on iran suspending its enrichment program, it gave the iranians an excuse not to come to the table. %$* 399
obama has taken away the excuse, which is one of the reasons why i’m impressed by his sophisticated diplomacy. %$* 399
and i can tell you for certain, that the european allies agree with this, and that they are ready to negotiate with us on that basis. %$* 399
dan senor. %$* 13
nick, if the americans have taken away the excuse, how long before the iranians reciprocate, i mean, how long, you said six months, are you giving six months for them to agree to come to the table, or are you giving them six months, once they agree to come to the table, that then they have six months to figure out whether or not we can get a deal. %$* 142
you know, ken and i are not arguing that diplomacy is a panacea. %$* 399
we’re not naïve. %$* 399
we know that diplomacy might not work, but if you try diplomacy, and give it a shot, then it does strengthen us for what’s ahead, what’s ahead of us. %$* 399
two major options to deal with iran. %$* 399
one is to go back to very tough sanctions of the type that we haven’t tried before, because we haven’t had the credibility to convince the rest of the world to do it. %$* 399
and finally the use of force, and i’ve said, we should leave the use of force, the threat of it on the table, we should threaten sanctions, but you’ve gotta go through this diplomatic process first, to get to either of them. %$* 399
if you don’t do that you have no credibility— %$* 399
what’s on the table is that the iranians don’t want negotiations, dan senor said chasing iranians to the negotiating table. %$* 13
ken pollack, do you think iran, anybody in iran wants negotiations— %$* 13
i think the problem is that the iranians do want negotiations, it’s not clear that they actually want a deal. %$* 400
that’s the problem, and that’s exactly what dan is getting at, and he’s right to. %$* 400
but, you know, the point that— look, we’re not the ones writing out the policy for the administration, if we were we’d be glad to engage this question of exactly when. %$* 400
for the purposes of this debate, for the abstract expression of it, i think that the key point is again, what will it take to get the allies signed up for the tough sanctions. %$* 400
if it’s six months of making a good-faith effort, fine. %$* 400
if they say nine, fine. %$* 400
now, we can’t let it go forever, and for me the big question mark is can we get them signed up to harsh sanctions in advance, based on when the iranians pass certain milestones. %$* 400
that oughta be the key question. %$* 400
make a point there because that is an important point, and actually we did that. %$* 230
we had them as nick well knows signed up in advance for tough negotiations in 2006 when we offered tough sanctions. %$* 230
when we offered direct negotiations, the deal was, that the allies would agree ahead of time that they would support tough sanctions on the iranians if the iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment. %$* 230
the iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment, we got security council resolutions which the russians in particular, as nick knows because he spent hours and hours dealing with the russians, managed to take every single tooth out of. %$* 230
now we’ve, since the obama administration has been in office, had the russian foreign minister in washington, and he’s announced that in fact he doesn’t believe it’s time for tougher sanctions against the iranians. %$* 230
but, i think it’s very important for people in the audience, first of all to look at the wording of the resolution, the question is not all of the questions that nick and ken are trying to get you to focus on, it’s not should we go to war, it’s not, should we do diplomacy or not diplomacy, the question is, is our current policy going anywhere. %$* 230
that’s the question, and i find it really fundamentally irresponsible, for nick and ken to act like, let’s just give diplomacy a chance ‘cause we haven’t done it before. %$* 230
nick burns. %$* 13
right. %$* 399
liz and i are, i’m not gonna engage in attacks, liz and i are friends and we’ve been colleagues— %$* 399
it’s not true— %$* 399
—honestly, i don’t think that was an—a personal attack— %$* 13
oh— %$* 399
—that was— %$* 13
i’m— %$* 399
—that was right to the core of the argument— %$* 13
—it’s not true that we also—it’s not true that we live in alternate universes. %$* 399
but it may seem that way. %$* 399
now what happened in 2006 when the united states government made the most ambitious offer we’d ever made %$* 399
and i really commend president bush and vice president cheney and secretary rice for order—authorizing that. %$* 399
we made a very good offer and the iranians turned it down, that’s the iranians’ fault, they walked away at that time. %$* 399
but what hadn’t happened— what hadn’t happened is that we did not have explicit promises from the russians and chinese, much less the germans, french and british, as to what type of sanctions would follow. %$* 399
and so what ken and i are arguing is that, it would i think behoove itself to president obama, to make a very explicit deal with moscow and beijing, before the united states sits down at the negotiating table, the russians and chinese will specify the type of sanctions that would ensue, should negotiation fail. %$* 399
that would be a stronger position that we had in the bush administration. %$* 399
this policy was actually sold internally, because people were told that we had commitments that there would be sanctions if the iranians in fact did not suspend enrichment, now maybe you’re—now maybe you’re, it’s semantics about specific sanctions. %$* 230
but the idea was, the—i’m telling you what i know. %$* 230
what i know is that we had a commitment from those allies that we would go to sanctions, that they would support tough sanctions, if in fact the iranians refused to suspend. %$* 230
the iranians refused to suspend, and we got no tough sanctions. %$* 230
the tough—the word “tough” is not accurate. %$* 399
i negotiated that deal, ahead of time— %$* 399
you negotiated— %$* 230
—and i negotiated— %$* 399
—for weak sanctions. %$* 230
no i didn’t. %$* 399
i didn’t. %$* 399
i mean let’s be fair about this, liz. %$* 399
let’s be fair about it. %$* 399
i served in the democratic administration and republican administration. %$* 399
the policy of both president clinton and president bush has not worked %$* 399
and we oughta have the courage to see it— %$* 399
i totally agree with you— %$* 230
—and the courage to admit it— %$* 399
i agree with you. %$* 230
and so what president obama is trying to do, is to create a new type of diplomacy, it is very tough-minded. %$* 399
it allows us to fall back on military force if we have to, but it does give diplomacy a chance for the first time. %$* 399
we did not have commitments, for the type of specific sanctions that would go into play, and you haven’t seen that in 2006 and ‘7 and ‘8, these were very weak un security council resolutions, admittedly. %$* 399
and now we’ve gotta have a different way of going forward, with diplomacy. %$* 399
so if liz and dan say, diplomacy’s failing, president obama’s failing, then i think what they’re really doing is leaving him with one option and that is war and they can’t deny that— %$* 399
dan senor, the—nick burns just made the point, why not give it a chance, it’s a new initiative, and he says in a new style, why not give it a chance. %$* 13
‘cause it takes two parties to participate in a diplomatic process and right now there’s only one party participating in it. %$* 142
so we can call and call and call all we want, but they’re not participating, and i know we’re asking everyone here to vote on this motion, as liz alluded to earlier, the arab world which is closest to this, is already voting. %$* 142

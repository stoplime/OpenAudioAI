that's an efficiency. %$* 654
so there are some-- %$* 654
a brack we do a lot of the same stuff with fewer bases. %$* 654
that's an efficiency. %$* 654
so there are-- %$* 654
i'm not a big efficiency guy. %$* 654
i basically agree with panetta. %$* 654
but that's why i said, why don't we cut the size of the army? %$* 654
which i think you might agree with. %$* 654
you know, we-- %$* 654
not going to occupy a country. %$* 654
we could have a smaller ground force. %$* 654
that's not an efficiency. %$* 654
that's a strategic choice. %$* 654
that's what i'm talking about, more strategic choices. %$* 654
tom donnelly-- %$* 13
tom donnelly, is it accurate what ben friedman just said, that you also want to cut the size of the army? %$* 13
no, i mean, i think ben laid it out very well. %$* 652
okay. %$* 13
it’s not an efficiency, it is a choice, a choice to have less power and to withdraw. %$* 652
all right. %$* 13
landed that very well. %$* 13
is it an issue of having less power? %$* 13
is it okay to be less powerful? %$* 13
kori schake. %$* 13
i'm not in favor of that, as a matter of fact. %$* 655
i agree with tom on that. %$* 655
but it seems to me that maintaining american power in the international order is more affordable than our colleagues across the aisle suggest it is. %$* 655
and let me just give you one example-- %$* 655
isn't it more a matter of style? %$* 13
i believe your opponents are talking about not really wanting to do away with a lot of carrier groups. %$* 13
am i right about that? %$* 13
you want the aircraft carriers there. %$* 13
you want them deployed around the world. %$* 13
you want them near other people's shores. %$* 13
you want troops stationed in nato ally countries and in south korea. %$* 13
am i right about-- %$* 13
i think kori, i think, hit on a good point, which is we're going to need not to do more of the same. %$* 653
we're going to need to begin to think about things differently. %$* 653
as robert rosenkranz mentioned, the problem set is becoming quite a bit different than afghanistan and iraq. %$* 653
the problem is, as i mentioned before, that when you've got a shrinking budget and exploding personnel costs, what gets squeezed out are science and technology, research and development of new capabilities, training and exercise to test out these capabilities to find out what works and what doesn't. %$* 653
and so you're stuck making a big bet, and you hope it'll work, but you really don't have the chance to test it out. %$* 653
okay. %$* 13
andrew, let me give the floor back to kori because i took it away from her, and then you took it away from me. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
well done. %$* 13
but it's not going to happen again. %$* 13
i basically agree with what andy just said. %$* 655
but the point is that, for example, take the army, right? %$* 655
you don't have to make one big bet by cutting the size of the army. %$* 655
the size of the army in the 1990s, before september 11th, was 490,000 soldiers. %$* 655
that was when you still had the planning construct that said we had to be able to fight two nearly simultaneous wars. %$* 655
it was before you had the revolution in communications and precision and battlefield awareness that has made american forces so much more effective than they were. %$* 655
it was before the defense guidance, which secretary panetta brought into being in the pentagon that said that we are not going to size our force to fight a large, sustained land war anymore. %$* 655
and yet, the size the army says it needs is 490,000, the exact same as in 1990.the threats are different, the requirements are different. %$* 655
we need to find new ways to do stuff. %$* 655
the answer shouldn't be the exact same as it was in the 1990s. %$* 655
tom donnelly and then ben friedman. %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
well this is extraordinary reminiscent-- %$* 652
i mean, this is the kind of talk you heard out of donald rumsfeld before 9/11.490,000 was too small. %$* 652
we proved that by being unable to do iraq and afghanistan properly at the same time, so i don't think that was a good experience. %$* 652
and i don't want to expect that the world is going to be technologically transformed and that the art of war is going to be fundamentally different than it's ever been in human history. %$* 652
that seemed like a bit of a long shot to me, too. %$* 652
so numbers matter, and we have just proved that in spades over the last decade. %$* 652
meaning what? %$* 13
you need a lot of boots on the ground, is that what you're saying? %$* 13
there are some things that you cannot do with technology. %$* 652
and we have actually, you know, fought irregular wars and counterinsurgencies in the most technologically sophisticated way ever, but i don't think the result was satisfactory. %$* 652
ben friedman. %$* 13
again, i hear arguments being made for me that i don't make. %$* 654
i am not signing up for the don rumsfeld vision of anything in my argument. %$* 654
you know, occasionally we might agree on something, but my argument is not his. %$* 654
he liked war a lot more than i do, and the-- %$* 654
we're hearing a lot of assumptions about the changes that will be made if we-- %$* 654
or what will happen if we cut the defense budget-- %$* 654
personnel will get squeezed and we'll cut the o&m budget, so we'll have a hollow force. %$* 654
if we did that, it would be a mistake. %$* 654
the-- %$* 654
so we don't endorse things that will lead to a hollow force. %$* 654
the military of the '70s i'll grant was a bit of a hollow force. %$* 654
the personnel situation was bad, but that's because we didn't pay them enough. %$* 654
we-- %$* 654
compensation is much better now by a mile. %$* 654
and we are making choices now to avoid cutting the o&m budget at the expense of procurement, so we can avoid that. %$* 654
and our argument doesn’t entail doing all the bad things you say it does. %$* 654
and finally, i think, since you asked, power-- %$* 654
power is our capacity to generate force. %$* 654
it's potential. %$* 654
it's not standing military forces. %$* 654
there are powerful nations that have quite small militaries. %$* 654
the difference is they could-- %$* 654
with weak nations is they could change that if they wanted to. %$* 654
so our long term economic health, of course, is essential to our power. %$* 654
i-- %$* 13
question for this side, unless you want to respond, because i wanted to move it along so we if you want to respond because-- %$* 13
i'm just saying that we are only at the dawn of sequestration, and all you have to do is read the papers. %$* 653
the air force is cutting back on training, the army's cutting back on training, the air force can't replace its aging aircraft in part because we screwed up over the last decade or so in terms of the procurement approach. %$* 653
but, again, that's poor excuse for compromising our security and punishing our service members. %$* 653
so yeah, were mistakes made? %$* 653
certainly they were. %$* 653
you know, does that mean we give up on our security because we didn't get it right or is that-- %$* 653
do we ignore what's going on now? %$* 653
all right, do you want to respond, ben? %$* 13
well, i was going to say the sequestration-- %$* 654
we have one kind of sequestration in fiscal year 2013 which said no matter what happens with the budget we cut across the board, we cut everything equally. %$* 654
and that wasn't quite as severe as the services made it out to be, but it was dumb, and i'm against it. %$* 654
we're against it. %$* 654
but going forward, what we have is budget caps, and if they get under the cap they can do whatever they want. %$* 654
so we don't have to do all those foolish things with cutting back on training in '14, '15, '16, '17.as long as they get under the cap, they can make choices. %$* 654
so sequestration in '13 was dumb, going forward as long as they get under the cap, it's okay. %$* 654
but then we still have the personnel problem. %$* 653
and part of the budget control act, the president was given the option of exempting personnel costs and personnel cuts, and so again you have that situation where you have this personnel budget that is crowding out everything else. %$* 653
but benefits are being cut. %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 653
benefits are being cut? %$* 13
benefits-- %$* 653
you know, the proposal right now is to scale back on some of the healthcare benefits and so on, but the-- %$* 653
what the president can do is exempt-- %$* 653
what the-- %$* 653
as ben was saying, what you have is what the pentagon calls a "haircut," everything get's cut. %$* 653
and i think one thing we all agree on is this is a foolish way to run things. %$* 653
i'm-- %$* 13
what i'm trying to figure out is what you all disagree on-- %$* 13
because i know you do. %$* 13
i know you do, and i think it goes to this issue of, "what are our enemies thinking? %$* 13
" and all of you in your opening statements said, "i don't want to read my enemy's mind because it's unpleasant to be in there." but i think we want to talk about the notion, and this was alluded to by you, tom, in your opening statement, that this is-- %$* 13
a weaker u.s.military is a temptation not just for china but for who knows to do things that right now they're just not going to bother doing. %$* 13
it's also some freedom for our allies to not be militarized and to dampen down those ambitions. %$* 13
so what about that whole point of our enemies' perception of us being not dominant? %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
i think we-- %$* 652
as andrew says, if you read the newspapers, or listen to npr, or whatever-- %$* 652
tom, i just want to-- %$* 13
for the radio, to ask you to state-- %$* 13
if you just walk toward the mic. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
again, i-- %$* 652
when i read the newspapers in the morning, or read the news online, or however i get my news, what i see is people feeling for openings in weak spots. %$* 652
we see that very much in syria and iraq. %$* 652
the war has spread to western iraq, northern jordan, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 652
we see that in the pacific, in the south china sea, where the chinese, even without an aircraft carrier, are nudging and pushing at what ben calls the various rocks in the south china sea; the things that really matter to our allies, people who are our treaty allies, like the filipinos. %$* 652
i don't want there to be a war over a rock in the south china sea. %$* 652
and what we see is people feeling for how far they can go in the absence of an american military presence. %$* 652
okay. %$* 13
let me take this to the other side. %$* 13
very specifically stated that the perception that our commitment to strong defense may be wavering is already resulting in people putting up feelers to see what they can get away with. %$* 13
sounds very logical. %$* 13
i want to put that to kori schake. %$* 13
i-- %$* 655
but-- %$* 13
kori schake. %$* 13
because enemies always probe, like, for your weaknesses. %$* 655
that's what enemies do. %$* 655
the iranians aren't newly racing for a nuclear weapon. %$* 655
they've been doing it since before we started cutting defense spending. %$* 655
the chinese have been-- %$* 655
but the logic of that is-- %$* 13
before-- %$* 655
they’re going to race even faster if they think-- %$* 13
if they were getting-- %$* 13
if our resolve is wavering. %$* 13
enemies don't play to your strong suit, right? %$* 655
nobody can fight the american army in an open-space tank battle, because they're going to lose. %$* 655
what enemies try and do is play to your weaknesses. %$* 655
that's why they go for terrorism-- %$* 655
but that's what he said-- %$* 13
they're saying. %$* 13
that's what they're saying. %$* 13
but there's-- %$* 655
whether we have eight carrier groups or nine, i actually don't think is going to make that much different to the chinese calculation about whether they want a chinese dream that is their dominance of the pacific. %$* 655
we need a comprehensive sense of our strength. %$* 655
and right now, we are stronger in our military capabilities than we are in our trade agreements, than we are in our diplomacy, than we are in our development. %$* 655
we ought to hedge up what our actual weaknesses are, not continue to reinforce our strengths. %$* 655
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
we are being confronted by some strategic choices, to use ben's term. %$* 653
there are three agents of the world that we rely on for trade and for resources. %$* 653
we're part of the global economy. %$* 653
and we rely on the global common space, cyber space, the sea, and the undersea to link us to those parts of the world. %$* 653
in the far east, the chinese, for over a decade now, have been building up their military capabilities to try and push us out of the region. %$* 653
just listen to what the japanese, the taiwanese, the koreans, and so on are saying. %$* 653
we have a strategic choice. %$* 653
now, it's not going to be a big army that we respond with. %$* 653
but we're going to have to do something to maintain stability in that region, lest we encourage chinese adventurism. %$* 653
and you could see it in the paper, in terms of the trends in chinese behavior. %$* 653
iran-- %$* 653
a nuclear armed iran. %$* 653
do you think they're more or less likely to support hezbollah, or to support assad in syria, or to try and undermine the gulf monarchies, and disrupt the flow of energy? %$* 653
pakistan-- %$* 653
and again, you know, i don’t want to go on at length. %$* 653
but you look at cyber situation. %$* 653
concerns that even non-state entities will be able to inflict serious damage on us by cyber attacks. %$* 653
all right. %$* 13
andrew, let me-- %$* 13
let ben friedman respond. %$* 13
well, i mean, contrary to how it appears in washington dc, the world actually doesn't revolve around washington dc. so what china does vis-a-vis its territorial claims-- %$* 654
this is shocking-- %$* 654
is not completely driven by conversations in washington or small differences in our defense spending from year-to-year. %$* 654
what iran does, in terms of disrupting energy flows or funding hezbollah, is not driven by small differences in u.s.defense budget. %$* 654
they might have some minor preference but it really doesn't matter. %$* 654
they're going to do what they're going to do for other reasons than a margin of difference in our defense spending. %$* 654
if there's been any indication that the united states is not as up for war as it was a while ago, it wasn't because we're spending a little less on the military, it's because we had bad wars that made the public less enthusiastic to go, which is a good thing. %$* 654
and maybe it cuts back on our credibility, but-- %$* 654
if you want lots of credibility to have wars, then don't have dumb ones all the time, you know? %$* 654
save it for the-- %$* 654
save it for the-- %$* 654
for the good times. %$* 654
so-- %$* 654
i'll leave it there. %$* 654
you guys want to pick up? %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
i would-- %$* 653
well, i would just say that-- %$* 653
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
take the far east example. %$* 653
the purpose of trying to maintain a stable military balance in the region and address the capabilities that the chinese are building up-- %$* 653
the purpose is to avoid war, not to fight war. %$* 653
you can get into a war because of the perception that you're too weak to defend yourselves or that you're irresolute. %$* 653
and cutting a trillion dollars additionally out of defense over the next decade certainly, i think, sends that message as we withdraw from parts of the world. %$* 653
yeah. %$* 13
i just want to put to this. %$* 13
i mean, history-- %$* 13
20th century has got some great examples of weakness being perceived as an opportunity for aggression. %$* 13
that's the point the other side just made. %$* 13
again, there's a logic to it, and there's a historical precedent for it. %$* 13
it's not a ridiculous claim, so can you respond to that, kori schake? %$* 13
it's a very strong claim. %$* 655
i agree with it. %$* 655
but it hinges on the belief that we are close to the margin at which another military believes they could defeat the united states militarily. %$* 655
well, the logic of what you're saying is that they only don't because we're so dominant. %$* 13
so you're saying they won't-- %$* 13
they won't mess with us because we're so dominant, therefore we don't have to be so dominant anymore. %$* 13
well, i'm saying it's a really wide margin. %$* 655
we're not close to the line at which-- %$* 655
okay. %$* 13
china thinks they can fight the american navy-- %$* 655
so what you're saying is we can afford to be a lot less dominant, and we would still be pretty darn dominant. %$* 13
yes, exactly. %$* 655
okay. %$* 13
let me take it to-- %$* 13
that point to the other side, that we have a lot of wiggle room is what your opponents are saying. %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
one of the things that technology has yet to solve is how to be in two places at once. %$* 652
as advanced as our military and-- %$* 652
is-- %$* 652
pardon me-- %$* 652
you know, if it's not there, it's not there. %$* 652
and what we see in the world now is the effect of us not being there. %$* 652
china doesn't want to go to war with us. %$* 652
they probably want to go to war with us even less than we could ever possibly want to go to war with them. %$* 652
they want the benefits of nibbling away, pushing the limits. %$* 652
they want to intimidate the filipinos and the taiwanese. %$* 652
they don't want to mess with us. %$* 652
but if we're not there, there are going to be consequences. %$* 652
and you see it every day. %$* 652
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to go shortly to the audience for questions. %$* 13
and how that will work is just raise your hand, and i'll call on you, and a mic will be brought to you. %$* 13
and if you can just stand up, state your name-- %$* 13
i will. %$* 13
i'm going to come back to it. %$* 13
this is all prelude. %$* 13
and a mic-- %$* 13
we're going to try it a little bit more here. %$* 13
i just want to get you to get ready and get your questions really perfect, really perfect. %$* 13
and just stand up, tell us your name and ask the question. %$* 13
and the last thing i want to just say is to keep the microphone as close to your mouth as this is to mine. %$* 13
go ahead, ben friedman. %$* 13
weakness can be provocative, but, you know, a lot of us kept going to history class the day after we talked about munich and world war ii.and strength can also be provocative. %$* 654
states balance power. %$* 654
states design, build military capability in response not necessarily to weakness but to being threatened by other states. %$* 654
states' decisions to build nukes and to build armies are often driven by threats, including the ones that the united states poses to their borders. %$* 654
so it's not so simple that our weakness encourages buildups. %$* 654
and i really think we ought to talk more carefully about what scenario would take place absent a larger u.s.commitment to asia that's so nefarious. %$* 654
i think, yeah, the philippines and taiwan and japan might spend a little more on defense and create a stronger alliance among them. %$* 654
but that's not a bad thing necessarily. %$* 654
we can-- %$* 654
we can live with other states having geopolitical responsibilities. %$* 654
let's have-- %$* 13
let this side respond to that and i'll come to questions. %$* 13
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
those of you who recall the melian dialogue, and i'm not quite old enough to recall that, but the famous phrase is, “the strong do what they can; the weak do what they must."if you're weak, others will decide your fate. %$* 653
if you're strong, at least you have the option of being smart or stupid. %$* 653
and hopefully we elect people who are the former and not the latter. %$* 653
being melians right now. %$* 654
we're the athenians in the dialogue. %$* 654
i'm sorry? %$* 653
we're the athenians in the dialogue. %$* 654
we not going to be the weak, right? %$* 654
we're-- %$* 654
we'll be-- %$* 654
again, getting back to the point we were discussing a little bit earlier-- %$* 653
and kori kind of set this up. %$* 653
chinese are good strategists. %$* 653
yeah, we have the world's best air force. %$* 653
but our aircraft in the far east are concentrated at two bases. %$* 653
what are the chinese doing? %$* 653
they're building lots of ballistic missiles to target those bases. %$* 653
we have the world's best carriers, as kori mentioned, and a lot of them. %$* 653
the chinese are developing missiles to target those carriers and they're building submarines to go after those carriers. %$* 653
so do we cut the-- %$* 653
you know, do we need a big army for china, to maintain stability in that region? %$* 653
hardly. %$* 653
but we are going to figure out-- %$* 653
or going to need to figure out a way to maintain stability in that region. %$* 653
otherwise, i don't think the filipinos are going to say, “you know, the americans are gone. %$* 653
let's take on the chinese.” now, the japanese may say, “the americans are gone, we need nuclear weapons.” and let's see what that does to the neighborhood. %$* 653
let's take some questions. %$* 13
sir, right down in the front, right in the middle. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
you gave me the nod, and i gave it back to you, and you're standing up. %$* 13
you have to know how to do the nod. %$* 13
it's sort of one of these. %$* 13
hi. %$* 656
my name is josh sax my question is for the affirmative side. %$* 656
there's clearly waste in the defense budget i think you would agree on. %$* 656
there's stuff in there that is really more of a jobs program than weapons, stuff the army doesn't even want like additional abrams tanks. %$* 656
would you think that if we were to reduce spending on those things that it would be better to reallocate that spending to additional military priorities? %$* 656
or would it be better in our long-term interest to take those reductions and put it towards reducing the national debt? %$* 656
great question. %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 652
one thing, look, we need to get sort of the best bang for the buck that we can under any circumstances, whether we're spending more or spending less. %$* 652
on the other hand, compared to other forms of government, i would offer the pentagon is actually, again, a good value proposition. %$* 652
if the public education system educated my kids as well as the military does its job, both my kids would have gone to harvard, and they didn't. %$* 652
you know, if my doctor kept me as healthy as the military kept the world, i would live forever. %$* 652
so as a government function for all the waste, fraud, and abuse that there may be in the department-- %$* 652
and i wish it were zero-- %$* 652
it's relatively less. %$* 652
and the dollar amount is really trivial when we're talking about the size of the federal debt or the deficit. %$* 652
look, we spend as much per year almost-- %$* 652
and if interest rates actually go up to a market rate, more on servicing our current debt than we do on military power. %$* 652
so in the relative size of things, we're not talking about a lot of money. %$* 652
you know, trillions and trillions, and pretty soon you're talking about real money. %$* 652
but compared to the rest of the economy or what the government spends, this is peanuts. %$* 652
right down in the front here. %$* 13
and it's coming down the front aisle. %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
i have a bad habit of sort of favoring people who are closer to me. %$* 13
it's totally unjustified. %$* 13
so if you're in the back, be a little bit more aggressive to get my attention. %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 657
thank you. %$* 657
my name is annabelle fisher. %$* 657
first i want to say all of us support our military. %$* 657
i don't think there's anyone here who does not support our men and women who are protecting us. %$* 657
and i have worked for the military. %$* 657
this is a question for both sides. %$* 657
sunday, june 2nd in the washington post, costs and benefits for the military. %$* 657
and it talks about 149 billion that will be spent by the military; pensions, salaries, military making more than-- %$* 657
well, i've never made-- %$* 657
so, ma'am, what is your question? %$* 13
so my question that-- %$* 657
both sides, if we can reduce some spending in the military, and you're looking-- %$* 657
you talked about reduction in hr, in costs, pensions, healthcare, yes, tri-care folks need to pay a little more money, is this appropriate? %$* 657
will this impact our military? %$* 657
and do we have a better-- %$* 657
does china have a better strategy than our military? %$* 657
i think we have a pretty good strategy. %$* 657
okay, ma'am, i-- %$* 13
i'm not sure what the-- %$* 13
you went through a lot of subordinate clauses, and i lost the question. %$* 13
i'm really focusing really on this article in the post that talked about ways-- %$* 657
okay, i'm going to-- %$* 13
save money. %$* 657
i'm going to refer folks to the article and thanks very much. %$* 13
sir in the back. %$* 13
i think we agree that-- %$* 18
yeah, i think everybody does agree on that. %$* 13
we've covered it. %$* 13
sir, right-- %$* 13
i'm pointing right to the very center. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah. %$* 13
if you stand up. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
hi. %$* 658
my name is bernie william. %$* 658
i'm a grad student at seton hill university, studying diplomacy. %$* 658
my question is, first, to start off, the carter center for peace has said that since world war ii, of the 50 major armed conflicts that have gone on, they've all been about religion or ethnic conflict. %$* 658
and they've all been pretty much within borders. %$* 658
so-- %$* 658
and the actual occurrence of violence has gone down, and the number of people being killed has gone down. %$* 658
so is the threat to the united states that much-- %$* 658
increasing so much when we're using our military to go into these countries, essentially almost as our diplomats, and saying, “this is our brand of americanism, and you have to-- %$* 658
and you have to accept it”? %$* 658
can the military be changed to be more of our diplomatic arm, or could that money be better spent to diplomats, commerce, and improving trade? %$* 658
i'm trying to think if that actually addresses the issue of whether reductions in the military threatens our security. %$* 13
and i don't think it quite gets there. %$* 13
do you want to take another run at it? %$* 13
because i think you're close to it. %$* 13
i can give an answer. %$* 655
i know you're all set for it, but i want the people are going to be listening on the radio and not understand that. %$* 13
i guess what i'm saying is that it seems that our military is creating more enemies by being out there and doing stuff-- %$* 658
and doing what it does. %$* 658
and it-- %$* 658
and should the-- %$* 658
and it seems like i'm following the “against” side in saying that the military needs to reshape its force so that it's doing more diplomatic efforts, navy admirals going-- %$* 658
but what about-- %$* 13
what if that costs a lot of money? %$* 13
your premise is that it would-- %$* 13
i'm saying-- %$* 658
well no, i'm agreeing that the ground forces be reduced and then we-- %$* 658
and but is it better to-- %$* 658
okay, can i phrase your question this way? %$* 13
does the military have less expensive ways, without using military force, to actually keep the nation safer? %$* 13
yes. %$* 658
now can you say that? %$* 13
i'm kori schake. %$* 13
give that man a microphone. %$* 18
one of the things that has happened in the last-- %$* 655
with the wars of the last 12 years, is that things that have traditionally been diplomatic and development functions have migrated into military space. %$* 655
and that's because we don't train our diplomats and our development people to the same level of professional expertise that we train our military, and we need to do that. %$* 655
that's actually a better place to spend our money. %$* 655
it matters to see diplomats doing diplomatic work, and we could spend our money that way, we just choose not to. %$* 655
the military-- %$* 654
let me go to the other side first and then come back to you. %$* 13
tom donnelly. %$* 13
the original question posited a correlation between less war and less dying in recent years. %$* 652
that correlates really strongly with the rise of american power. %$* 652
so, again, that's what i was talking about originally. %$* 652
this has produced great benefits, not only to us, but to humanity-- %$* 652
and there's-- %$* 652
and kori will remember this from her own time in the white house. %$* 652
the problem with diplomats is that if you want to send them to afghanistan, at least until recent years, they could say no. %$* 652
they could refuse to go. %$* 652
so we need all the tools in our kit bag of all kinds, but we should not pretend that military power isn't part of what needs to be in that kit bag. %$* 652
okay, one more round and-- %$* 13
well, i mean, look, let's not make the argument that if only the military would handle diplomacy, diplomacy would be easy. %$* 654
i mean, diplomacy is really hard. %$* 654
we sort of have this idea that because diplomats don't produce magical results in transforming societies that are problems, that we should hand it over to the military, which is really good at destroying things but also doesn't have the tools to build society. %$* 654
so i'm certainly not in favor of transforming the military's mission. %$* 654
the-- %$* 654
what tom just said ignores a vast social science literature on the causes of the long peace. %$* 654
this idea that peace in the world, this massive decline in violence which you referred to, which is not talked about enough-- %$* 654
everyone should read steve pinker's book about this-- %$* 654
civil wars are in massive decline, coups are in massive decline, genocide has been going away. %$* 654
your chances as a human of being killed in political violence have descended massively since world war ii.we don't talk about that in washington. %$* 654
that's not due to the benevolence of the united states of america, i don't think. %$* 654
it has to do with the spread of liberalism, maybe, the spread of capitalism, and the experience of wars which cause societies to learn. %$* 654
and, again, this isn't just me talking, this is most of the people who study this for a living. %$* 654
this idea that-- %$* 654
but ben aren't your opponents arguing that, in fact, the-- %$* 13
american military dominance is what created the conditions? %$* 13
i'm arguing against that right now. %$* 654
i'm saying that there's all these other factors that are doing the work. %$* 654
i don't know, but i think their point is that those-- %$* 13
that the american military dominance enabled those other factors to do all the work. %$* 13
well, if you think it's just pure magic, and it does everything in the world, then it's hard to defeat that proposition, but-- %$* 654
you look-- %$* 654
there are parts of the world where the american military is not very present, and we see i think a lot of the same results there, absent that, okay? %$* 654
so and if you read pinker's book, he says this progression has been going on much longer, even prior to world war ii, which is kind of hard to understand, but it's not a controversial sentiment that violence is massively declining. %$* 654
andrew, hang on one second. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donovan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
there's a saying that hope and wishing is not a strategy. %$* 653
i would like to think that diplomacy could solve all our problems, we wouldn't need militaries. %$* 653
or that the global economy's stupid, if we all just sit down and shut up, we're going to get rich. %$* 653
fact of the matter is, in the absence of a stabilizing military force, you tend to get into trouble. %$* 653
look at the period from 1850 to 1914.the end of the napoleonic wars. %$* 653
britain emerges as the world's dominant power. %$* 653
and the pax britannica exists for a century, until the time that britain's power began to wane, they began to cut back on their defenses. %$* 653
they began to expand their social welfare programs, for better or worse. %$* 653
and germany decided that they could win a war quickly, that they could defeat the allies quickly. %$* 653
and what you ended up with is world war i and carnage on an unparalleled scale. %$* 653
again, it wasn't because the british were too strong that germany decided to go to war. %$* 653
it was because they thought they had an opportunity to advance their aims at the expense of others. %$* 653
sir? %$* 13
young man who was waving his ipad. %$* 13
i liked that move, so you're next. %$* 13
back to you. %$* 13
doug brooks i'm-- %$* 659
i used to run the trade association for companies that work in support of military operations abroad. %$* 659
but one thing that really strikes me is that we have-- %$* 659
we have come to the greatest commercial nation on earth, and yet our military is still using sort of 19th procurement lines and we sort of ignore the sort of ability to essentially create a more effective military for a far cheaper price. %$* 659
i mean, shouldn't we be looking to the-- %$* 659
you know, i think they both-- %$* 13
they've all conceded that we need to be better at efficiency, so i'm going to respectfully-- %$* 13
ask for another question. %$* 13
we can do the stuff and we can do it a lot cheaper. %$* 660
so we're actually-- %$* 660
by changing the way we do things, it's-- %$* 660
makes it worse for our enemies. %$* 660
if the-- %$* 660
but it's not-- %$* 654
it’s not the private sector. %$* 654
the public sector is different. %$* 654
it works differently. %$* 654
the incentive structures are massively different. %$* 654
we keep shipyards because they employ people. %$* 654
that's-- %$* 654
you know, if you're a senator for maine, i think it makes sense for you to keep that iron works open, even if you have excess overhead. %$* 654
so i don't think there are that many lessons in that regard from the private sector; i think we have to learn lessons from the public sector about how to be more efficient. %$* 654
sir? %$* 13

then you got to try someplace. %$* 216
i mean, congress is-- %$* 216
there are 535 members up there and they don't all do the same thing, believe me. %$* 216
can i respond to this briefly? %$* 214
ben wizner, sure. %$* 13
yeah, because i think that we may be slightly on the wrong track here. %$* 214
sometimes the scandal is something that is illegal that's going on, that people don't know about, that congress doesn't know about. %$* 214
and what the proper channel is, to go to congress and alert them-- %$* 214
sometimes the scandal is that a whole regime has been created in secret that the system deems legal. %$* 214
and that's what we're talking about here. %$* 214
i believe that these programs were briefed to the committees. %$* 214
i believe that the intelligence committees routinely approved this and were briefed on this, that they were taken to general alexander's lair, where he had hollywood set designers design a captain's chair and had the doors whoosh open and close like on the deck of the starship enterprise-- %$* 214
this was in an article in foreign policy magazine. %$* 214
i believe that they knew what was going on. %$* 214
so, a 29-year-old contractor calls up congress and says, "excuse me, i need to really tell you what you have wrongly approved in secret"-- %$* 214
no. %$* 214
what was needed-- %$* 214
was for the public to know. %$* 214
and once the public knew, everything changed. %$* 214
right down in front here. %$* 13
oh, let me just say something for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
i want to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion: snowden was justified. %$* 13
going back to questions from the audience. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
how long do we have here? %$* 18
about another 15. %$* 13
josh wolfe. %$* 218
some could say that we are not free unless we are safe. %$* 218
and we know that there are malicious actors. %$* 218
we know that the intent of the nsa's programs were to get these malicious actors. %$* 218
why is he justified in the context that we are now safer? %$* 218
why are we safer? %$* 218
great question. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 18
go ahead if you want. %$* 18
ben wizner. %$* 13
well, you know, again, i treat with great skepticism the claims that we're less safe. %$* 214
the nixon administration, in trying to block the publication of the pentagon papers in the new york times told the supreme court that their publication would cause great and irreparable harm to the security of the united states. %$* 214
now, that was nonsense. %$* 214
and the lawyer who wrote that brief said so 15 years ago in an apologetic op ed in the washington post. %$* 214
i think he's claims of harm to national security don't age as well as whistleblowers who age very, very well. %$* 214
but look, we're not just talking about protecting ourself from a threat of terrorism, which, although severe, is not a common occurrence. %$* 214
we're talking about protecting our republic. %$* 214
and sometimes our republic is more threatened by what we don't know than by publication of things that also alert our enemies. %$* 214
that detention that we face in a democracy, but the cost of democracy is that our enemies have to hear this too. %$* 214
we have to strike the balance in the right way. %$* 214
my view is that the balance was way tilted towards overclassification and secrecy before edward snowden. %$* 214
so you're not saying-- %$* 13
but then you're not saying we are safer. %$* 13
you're not saying that snowden has made us safer. %$* 13
well, actually, i think with a long term effective, snowden's revelations will make us safer in a critical respect. %$* 214
they will have an effect on the infrastructure of our communications, that-- %$* 214
one of the effects is that we will begin to prioritize defense, securing our communications over offense, manufacturing vulnerabilities in order to facilitate surveillance, this is a tension that exists within the nsa right now. %$* 214
i think that the spies have won out over the cyber defenders. %$* 214
and i think that it's in all our best-- %$* 214
all of our best interests to put more of our resources into defending the security of our communications rather than being sure that we can listen to every conversation in the world. %$* 214
okay. %$* 13
let's hear from your opponent, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
may i just say that having worked in the government for a very long time, it's not unknown to me-- %$* 48
and addressing mr. %$* 48
wizner's point about hyperbole. %$* 48
everything is either the biggest case that ever happened, it's the biggest leak that ever happened, it's the biggest damage that ever happened. %$* 48
it's not the most attractive propensity in government. %$* 48
but the fact that we ought to take a lot of that stuff with a grain of salt doesn't mean that we can't draw our common sense judgment that we've been profoundly harmed. %$* 48
when you give up secrets, you say that you-- %$* 48
the public needs to know. %$* 48
well, you can't inform the public about the methods and sources of the intelligence community without informing people who want to mass murder americans. %$* 48
you can't inform the public about the methods and sources not only of your own intelligence service but of the foreign intelligence services that we depend on the cooperation of to keep americans safe without convincing those foreign services that we are no longer trustworthy repositories of their secrets. %$* 48
when i was here last time-- %$* 48
i keep going back to it because it's such a strange variance. %$* 48
but when i was here the last time, one of the things that people were very concerned about is that we had isolated ourselves by making unilateral executive branch decisions that not only the other branches of the government didn't support, but that had made us look bad in the international community, and that if we were going to have effective counterterrorism, we needed the cooperation of our allies because there were many, many places in the world where they had good sources, and we didn't. %$* 48
and we couldn't protect the country without that. %$* 48
when you reveal not only our secrets, but their secrets, and you convince them that they might as well not tell us anything because we can't keep a secret, then we lose that cooperation. %$* 48
and that means that we lose our sources of information in the places of the world that are most dangerous to us. %$* 48
let me cut to the chase with what you just said to the other side and put to ben wizner. %$* 13
if, you know, stipulating that andrew mccarthy may well have a point. %$* 13
you don't really know you're saying the extent of the damage, but it seems, you know, within the realm of possibility that damage was caused. %$* 13
if damage was caused by what edward snowden did, of the kind he's talking about, if, was he justified in releasing what he did? %$* 13
yes, i think so. %$* 214
i think-- %$* 214
look, it's interesting that we have a strict liability standard for disclosing information, but we have a classification system that massively, massively overclassifies. %$* 214
both can be dangerous. %$* 214
look, i think that what edward snowden is go about it in a way that he considered responsible. %$* 214
he said, i've spent a sheltered life. %$* 214
i've been in the intelligence community. %$* 214
i don't trust my own biases. %$* 214
i'm going to go to principled but aggressive journalists. %$* 214
and those journalists should use their judgment about what should be published. %$* 214
now, edward snowden told time magazine-- %$* 214
he didn't agree with all those judgments-- %$* 214
that there were articles that were published that he did not agree were in the public interest, but that proved his point that he is not the one who should have been making those decisions alone and on his own. %$* 214
but, look, i think it's relevant to the question. %$* 214
if you could show me, with evidence and not classified innuendo, that what edward snowden did was more damaging to our national security than healthy for our democracy, i would take a different position. %$* 214
nothing i've heard pushes me there. %$* 214
are you saying, though, that he-- %$* 48
then he's not in control of what he took? %$* 48
i'm saying he's not in control of what's being published. %$* 214
so he takes it, he gives it to others, and then he's done. %$* 48
well, that's actually what most leakers do. %$* 214
i'm sorry, the point here has been-- %$* 215
again, i'm surprised didn't make-- %$* 215
it's not just that he gave it to journalists for their judgment, i think passed over very quickly here. %$* 215
the guardian and the washington post have both said that they have checked every article that they put out with nsa. %$* 215
some would disagree with their doing that, but they have done it, precisely to avoid danger of the sources and methods that you're describing of causing definite harm. %$* 215
now, in-- %$* 215
that is a first point which hasn't been made here exactly. %$* 215
but the fact is that wyden and udall-- %$* 215
congressman wyden. %$* 13
congressman wyden-- %$* 215
senator. %$* 215
senator, sorry. %$* 13
senator wyden and senator udall in fact felt that it was outrageous, that it was shocking to the american people if they knew that, if they knew this stuff, and it was probably unconstitutional. %$* 215
this is part of the intelligence committee. %$* 215
they knew that clapper was lying when he said that. %$* 215
they could not put it out, supposedly, because the rule of the committee was to keep that secret. %$* 215
i would say they made a very poor judgment there. %$* 215
i'm critical of them. %$* 215
obviously i'm on their side on many aspects of this. %$* 215
but i think they were not justified in choosing to stay in the committee, the price of which was to keep that secret from the american public that they thought should be public in order to keep that-- %$* 215
to cooperate in keeping that secret. %$* 215
the fact is that keeping your mouth shut-- %$* 215
and we are talking here about communications intelligence matters here, which were covered by 798.i had clearance for that at the time. %$* 215
i did not put out anything. %$* 215
i-- %$* 215
daniel, i'm sorry to interrupt you, but only because of the clock, that we are wrapping up round 2.that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is "snowden was justified." and now we move on to round 3.and round 3 is where each of the debaters make brief closing statements. %$* 13
they will be three minutes each. %$* 13
two. %$* 18
i'm sorry. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
that means everything else i've said tonight is wrong. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
it is time-- %$* 13
and it is time for you to learn, after that, which side argued best. %$* 13
oh, sorry, i skipped a page. %$* 13
that's why i'm on the wrong page. %$* 13
okay, i'm going-- %$* 13
i'm going backwards. %$* 13
let's rewind. %$* 13
round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be brief, two minutes each, uninterrupted. %$* 13
let's go to the first of these speakers. %$* 13
speaking for the motion, ben wizner, legal advisor to edward snowden and direct-- %$* 13
ben, for this one, you sit. %$* 13
okay. %$* 214
ben wizner is legal advisor to edward snowden and director of the aclu speech privacy and technology project. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ben wizner. %$* 13
i want to close with a few observations about the surveillance apparatus that edward snowden, through journalists has exposed. %$* 214
for much of our history, our privacy was protected as much by cost as by law. %$* 214
it was simply too expensive for governments to track most of us most of the time. %$* 214
now because of technology, for the first time in our history, it's technologically and feasibly possible, financially possible for governments to track all of us on a massive scale and to collect and store the majority of the world's communications. %$* 214
we now know that the nsa has built that capability and has used it in ways that are profoundly troubling to many of us. %$* 214
polls show that 6 in 10 americans think that the nsa's surveillance practices have gone too far. %$* 214
but edward snowden was even more concerned about what the nsa might do with these capabilities, say, in the aftermath of a traumatic terrorist attack. %$* 214
he believed that the weak protections that are in place right now were likely to be swept away and that our country's system would be replaced by one that looked very, very different. %$* 214
now, whether and with what controls we should entrust our government with those kinds of enormous powers is a hugely consequential decision in a democracy. %$* 214
we should have debated this issue before the nsa deployed a global dragnet surveillance apparatus. %$* 214
we didn't but it's not too late to debate it now and to impose strong democratic controls. %$* 214
now, i began this debate by quoting president obama, and i'm going to end in the same way. %$* 214
just a few weeks ago he gave a speech in january about nsa surveillance and the reforms that he would be implementing and proposing. %$* 214
and president obama repeated his words from june. %$* 214
he said, "one thing i am certain of, this debate will make us stronger." the president of the united states believes that the debate edward snowden launched, a debate that no one can seriously argue would have taken place without him, has made our nation stronger. %$* 214
thank you, ben wizner. %$* 13
i can't think of any stronger justification than that. %$* 214
thank you, i'm sorry your time is up. %$* 13
thank you, ben wizner. %$* 13
and our motion is "snowden was justified." and here to summarize his position against this motion, james woolsey. %$* 13
he is chairman of the foundation for defense of democracies and former director of the cia. ladies and gentlemen, james woolsey. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 216
i want to take a couple of minutes to describe one incident in my time as director of central intelligence, and it's how i think things like this ought to be done. %$* 216
a newspaper reporter was working on a story, and from the questions that he was asking and whom he was asking them of at the cia it was quite clear that he was onto an extremely sensitive operation that we were conducting, a legal one, i would say, and one that was of potentially great benefit to the united states but extremely dangerous. %$* 216
we did not want him to pursue that line of investigation. %$* 216
he was persistent. %$* 216
i indirectly approached his boss, the editor of the paper. %$* 216
i got nowhere. %$* 216
and so i asked if i could go see the editor of the paper, one-on-one. %$* 216
and the two of us talked. %$* 216
and i said, "i'm going to do something that no regulation authorizes. %$* 216
would you promise me you'll never say anything about what i'm going to say to you here to anybody ever? %$* 216
" he said, "yes, i'll promise." i said, "okay, here's the problem," and i explained how we were almost certainly going to lose one of our officers and one of his sources killed if we continued to see the kind of material coming out that his reporter was working on. %$* 216
we talked. %$* 216
we got together again the next day and talked. %$* 216
and we figured out that if he would just eliminate any reference in the reporter's story to time and date and leave the story the way it could be without mentioning either date or time, that we could probably have a reasonably secure situation. %$* 216
he thought about it for a bit. %$* 216
he was not used to having suggestions in the editing of his newspaper come from the director of the cia. but he-- %$* 216
jim woolsey, i can give you 10 more seconds. %$* 13
he thought for a second, we shook hands on it, we did what we said we were going to do, and the story went forward without the time and date, and the operation succeeded. %$* 216
thank you, james woolsey. %$* 13
i'm sorry that your time is up. %$* 13
our motion is "snowden was justified." and here to argue in support of this motion in his closing statement, daniel ellsberg, the pentagon's paper whistleblower and former u.s.military analyst. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
thank you, i-- %$* 215
i agree with ambassador woolsey that, that was, as director of central intelligence, an appropriate way to behave, convincing, and that the news editor was right, convinced by your argument, to change it. %$* 215
the guardian and the washington post have both said that they have modified at the request of the nsa virtually every story that they have written on the basis of this. %$* 215
they did not accept all the objections, but that in every case they have done some. %$* 215
i think that's appropriate. %$* 215
on one question that's come up again and again here as to what might happen with this american nsa government, congressional collection of potentially everything-- %$* 215
everything including content. %$* 215
let's call it potential at this moment. %$* 215
in fact, i would ask mr. %$* 215
mccarthy what he believes the collection storage agency for nsa data being built in bluffdale utah right now is for, if it is not for audio and video content. %$* 215
as tice has said, it is in use right now-- %$* 215
and part of it. %$* 215
and all the digital data in the world-- %$* 215
that's e-mail, chat logs, credit logs, everything-- %$* 215
can be stored in a small room. %$* 215
this huge facility is being collected, he believes, for content. %$* 215
and i wonder if you believe otherwise. %$* 215
when it comes to 9/11, if anyone here in the audience-- %$* 215
or at this table-- %$* 215
believes that edward snowden-- %$* 215
or any of us-- %$* 215
wants to increase the risk of another 9/11 or is indifferent to that, i think they are being very foolish. %$* 215
when it comes to having gone to congress, i think he learned from the example-- %$* 215
specifically of the nsa four people that i've talked about, plus tice-- %$* 215
that that would be a foolish thing to do. %$* 215
i must say that if you had asked me a year ago, when i believed these people as to what was being collected, whether there was any chance of reining this in and preserving our democracy, the separation of powers and everything-- %$* 215
with what was being collected, i would have been very pessimistic-- %$* 215
edward snowden has made-- %$* 215
i'll give you other-- %$* 13
the same 10 seconds i gave your opponents. %$* 13
10 seconds please. %$* 13
edward snowden has given me hope. %$* 215
and the reaction to what he's done and the reaction of congress and the public has given me hope. %$* 215
and i would say, when it comes-- %$* 215
thank you. %$* 13
daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
take a very solemn oath to defend our borders-- %$* 215
thank you, sir. %$* 13
you're out of time. %$* 13
but thank you. %$* 13
our motion is snowden was justified. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position, in two minutes, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
andrew mccarthy-- %$* 13
he's contributing editor to the national review and former chief assistant u.s.attorney. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
well, finally, i get to agree with daniel ellsberg. %$* 48
i think it's absolutely clear and absolutely sure that no one at that table wants another 9/11 to happen. %$* 48
and you know what? %$* 48
no one at the fbi wanted 9/11 to happen, either. %$* 48
i know, because i worked with those guys for years on these cases, knowing the enemy that we were up against. %$* 48
and yet, that didn't stop us from putting in regulations to the point that two weeks before 9/11 happened, we had two of the hijackers known to the fbi to be here. %$* 48
and the intelligence part of the fbi didn't allow the criminal investigative part of the fbi to try to track them down, because of the internal regulations that we had put in, because we thought that we could impose more law enforcement rules on a national security problem. %$* 48
and the result was, two weeks later, the 9/11 attacks. %$* 48
now, we are in an eternal tension between liberty and security. %$* 48
we're never going to resolve it. %$* 48
and it's also about as human a problem as you can imagine, which means that whether it's because of misfeasance or malfeasance, or something in between, mistakes are always going to be made. %$* 48
and some of them will sound scandalous, because of the life and death kinds of matters that we're dealing with. %$* 48
but the fact is, we've spent now-- %$* 48
in earnest, since 9/11, but certainly going back to the 1970s-- %$* 48
a great amount of our time trying to grapple with-- %$* 48
how do you impose the rule of law on the demands of war? %$* 48
sometimes we get it right. %$* 48
sometimes we don't get it right. %$* 48
but the point is, we're now at least at a place where civil liberties actually are elevated in a way that they never were before. %$* 48
and that's something to be celebrated. %$* 48
and breaking that is not something that could be justified. %$* 48
thank you, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you right now to push, again, the keypad at your seat that registers your votes. %$* 13
we will get the readout almost immediately. %$* 13
remember the team who changes their numbers the most-- %$* 13
between the first and the second vote-- %$* 13
will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is "snowden was justified." if you agree with that motion, push #1.if you disagree with that motion, push #2.if you are or became or remain undecided, push #3.and we will lock out the results in about 10 seconds, and we'll have them in about a minute-and-a-half. %$* 13
but as we're waiting for that to happen, i would just like to ask everyone to show their appreciation for the level of respect and intelligence that these debaters brought to the stage here today. %$* 13
it's an example of the reason that intelligence squared exists, where our goal is to raise the level of public discourse. %$* 13
and we know that the gulf between the gentlemen on this stage is enormous, but it was meant to-- %$* 13
a great deal that they were actually able to have this discourse in this fashion. %$* 13
and our debates, in fact, are made possible because of support by people like you and our listeners on radio, et cetera, our live stream, the podcasts. %$* 13
and we would ask you, if you would want to consider it, to please consider a donation to our organization by visiting our website and clicking on the "support"-- %$* 13
"support us" tab. %$* 13
and our website is www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
we would also like it if you tweeted about this debate. %$* 13
the twitter handle-- %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us. %$* 13
and the hash tag for tonight's debate is hash tag snowden. %$* 13
our next debate is here at the kaufman. %$* 13
it's on march 12th. %$* 13
our motion is "russia is a marginal power." arguing for this motion we have ian bremmer. %$* 13
he's founder and president of the eurasia group. %$* 13
he recently tweeted an interesting statistic, that 35 percent of russia's household wealth is in the hands of 110 russian people. %$* 13
his partner, edward lucas is a senior editor at the economist. %$* 13
he's the author of "deception," which is a book about russian espionage. %$* 13
and he also recently authored an ebook, "the snowden operation." arguing against them ambassador robert blackwell. %$* 13
he's a former deputy national security advisor who co-chaired the task force on russia and u.s.national interests; and peter hitchens, a columnist for the mail on sunday and former moscow correspondent of "the daily express." and before that debate, in the next couple of weeks, we're going to be traveling up to harvard law school. %$* 13
on the 27th, we're going to be debating affirmative action on campus. %$* 13
and then we're going to philadelphia to the national constitution center on march 5th. %$* 13
and we will be debating the legality and constitutionality of targeted killing of u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
tickets for all of our spring debates are on sale through our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so it is all in. %$* 13
remember, the way we do this is the team whose numbers have moved the most between the first and second vote in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the numbers. %$* 13
our motion was "snowden was justified." before the debate, 29 percent of you agreed with this motion, 29 percent were against, and 42 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
a big undecided. %$* 13
here is the second vote now. %$* 13
on the team arguing for the motion, their second vote is 54 percent. %$* 13
that went from 29 percent to 54 percent. %$* 13
that's 25 percentage points. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
now, the side arguing against the motion, their second vote was 35 percent. %$* 13
they pulled up 6 percentage points, but it's not enough. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion "snowden was justified" declared our winners. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

scientists have to be professional skeptics, right, they are trained not to take new information at face value, they have to ask where measurements come from and what they could possibly mean. %$* 365
they have to be dispassionate about the data, and just see where it leads. %$* 365
once you start making logically fallacious arguments in order to support a predetermined position, you are no longer acting as a scientist, you are acting as a lawyer, however scientific sounding you might seem. %$* 365
despite that natural skepticism, the national academies of all eight, g8 countries, all the major scientific societies, even the white house have agreed with a scientific consensus on this matter, which pointedly did not happen in the 1970s by the way. %$* 365
michael crichton for one has frequently stated the %$* 365
gavin schmidt, thank you very much. %$* 79
philip stott, you have the podium next. %$* 79
brian may i just take one second to thank very much the rosenkranz foundation and intelligence squared for having the great courtesy to invite me over from london to participate in this very exciting set of debates. %$* 103
thank you also to all my colleagues for their contribution and above all to the audience for i’m sure, gonna be exciting participation as well. %$* 103
i want to start exactly with the consensus word that was used by richard. %$* 103
can i just remind you he wanted an example. %$* 103
in the early 20th century, 95% of scientists believe in eugenics. %$* 103
science does not progress by consensus, it progresses by falsification and by what we call paradigm shifts. %$* 103
and in my, riposte i’ll be coming to a paradigm shift that could actually throw the whole of what that other side is saying through the window. %$* 103
but that's later. %$* 103
what i want to come to now is the 1970s that robert rosenkranz quite correctly reminded us of. %$* 103
because then a crisis was announced. %$* 103
and i want to quote from three newspapers. %$* 103
the christian science monitor, “warning, earth’s climate is changing faster than even experts expect.” i really like that. %$* 103
your own new york times, “a major cooling of the climate is widely inevitable.” and in newsweek, back to consensus, “meteorologists are almost unanimous that catastrophic famines will result from global cooling.” that was the 1970s. %$* 103
and there are many headlines. %$* 103
and what i would like to stress is, it was a stress on consensus, it was faster than expected, the evidence came from the oceans, from polar bears, it’s always polar bears, from the changing seasons and it’s always disaster. %$* 103
why do we believe them now? %$* 103
and what is important in this i think is to remember what that first earth day claimed. %$* 103
the first earth day in america claimed the following, that because of global cooling, the population of america would have collapsed to 22 million by the year 2000.and of the average calorie intake of the average american would be wait for this, 2,400 calories, would good it were. %$* 103
it’s nonsense and very dangerous. %$* 103
and what we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school science. %$* 103
climate always changes. %$* 103
it is always as dick said warming or cooling, it’s never stable. %$* 103
and if it were stable it would actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first time for four and a half billion years. %$* 103
second, humans have been influencing climate for a million years as hominids, from the first hominid that set fire to the savanna grasslands in africa, when particulates and gases started to rise and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the earth. %$* 103
it’s a long relationship. %$* 103
so the debate, is climate changing and are humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant. %$* 103
the answers are yes and yes, and always will be. %$* 103
what is really crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none of the politicians want you really to hear. %$* 103
climate is the most complex system we know governed by thousands of factors, i haven’t time to list them. %$* 103
but the point is, it’s like in my country, glasgow on a saturday night, chaos. %$* 103
and what we’re trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub. %$* 103
one. %$* 103
and it just won’t work, that’s the danger. %$* 103
in such a system, doing something at the margins and not doing something in the margins are equally unpredictable. %$* 103
and the question we should be asking our politicians are, what climate are you actually aiming to produce and when we get there won’t it change anyway? %$* 103
the crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are rejecting this and i ask you passionately to do so for the next two more important reasons, our uh, political agenda as michael hinted is wrong. %$* 103
there are two great crises in the world of which the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty. %$* 103
and this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves, london, new york and washington. %$* 103
it’s about us and about our hypochondria about the world. %$* 103
if you actually have clean water, you have modern energy, you will cope with change whatever it is, hot, wet, cold or dry. %$* 103
i’m a left wing critic of global warming because the agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous. %$* 103
and believe you me, neither republican nor democrat will do anything about it, because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy. %$* 103
now michael hinted at this, but i come from europe which has been lecturing the world on this subject. %$* 103
let me tell you, the hypocrisy in europe is absolutely mind blowing, i am embarrassed. %$* 103
the latest statistic from the environment agency in europe will predict under the kyoto protocol we won’t even be minus, that by 2012, we’ll be plus four percent. %$* 103
and did you know that island whom we all love actually under the kyoto protocol is allowed a growth of 13%? %$* 103
and some of the figures for the, for europe are just spectacularly worrying. %$* 103
spain, italy, portugal, we’re in the 40 percentile. %$* 103
and yet we lecture the world. %$* 103
what we see in this is an enormous danger for politicians in terms of their hypocrisy. %$* 103
i’m not going to say anything about al gore and his house. %$* 103
but it is a very serious point. %$* 103
global warming is also dangerous because i am an environmentalist, but what i’m beginning to see is that global warming is setting age-, agendas which are actually damaging for the environment. %$* 103
bio fuels in which the energy relationships are very dodgy, but which have a very significant effect certainly in my country on biodiversity. %$* 103
what is more, we’re having wind farms placed for global warming on very, very sensitive peatmoor habitats. %$* 103
don’t think therefore that if you’re an environmentalist, you have to be attached to this agenda. %$* 103
because it is now overarching, overdominant and is actually taking money and effort away from genuine and real on the ground %$* 103
..environmental concerns. %$* 103
but let me end with two images. %$* 103
angela merkel the german chancellor, my own good prime minister for whom i voted let me emphasize, arguing in public two weeks ago as to who in annie get the gun style could produce the best temperature. %$* 103
“i could do two degrees c said angela,” “no, i could only do three said tony.” stand back a minute, those are politicians, telling you that they can control climate to a degree celsius. %$* 103
this is a political crisis, not a crisis as put here, and i ask you passionately to vote against it. %$* 103
and samuel johnson and james thurber, i have to end with thurber because of the new yorker. %$* 103
samuel johnson, the great lexicographer talked of a, in russia last talked to an astronomer who thought he could control the sun and the %$* 103
.he was mad. %$* 103
i can’t get thurber in, thank you. %$* 103
one. %$* 79
..environmental concerns. %$* 103
but let me end with two images. %$* 103

.he was mad. %$* 103
thank you very much. %$* 79
i can’t get thurber in, thank you. %$* 103
brenda ekwurzel, the podium is yours. %$* 79
i’d like to thank the rosenkranz foundation, to all of you for taking time to discuss this urgent topic. %$* 366
uh, gavin schmidt, like in the climate scientists to forensics team of the csi, uh another metaphor that applies is that of a doctor. %$* 366
and studying global warming is like taking the earth’s temperature. %$* 366
we’ve seen that it’s rising, and also we have diagnosed the dominant cause of this fever is the heat trapping emissions from human activity. %$* 366
so far temperatures have gone up about over a degree, point, one point four degrees fahrenheit. %$* 366
that doesn’t mean much to our everyday lives, but it means everything to the earth. %$* 366
all of us have experienced 100 degree temperature, a hundred and two degree temperature, but we’ve survived. %$* 366
now the body cannot withstand 107 degree fahrenheit temperature. %$* 366
that’s about an eight degree jump above the average body temperature. %$* 366
now when it comes to the earth, the earth is much more fragile than the body when it comes to temperature. %$* 366
what we see is that a seven degree increase in global warming would mean that we would accelerate, we would intensify the water cycle, that means the wet places will get wetter and the dry places will get drier. %$* 366
it means we put at risk species that are gonna go extinct. %$* 366
it means that the summer arctic ice is at risk of disappearing. %$* 366
it also means that a seven degree rise in temperature would commit us to substantial sea level rise from melting of the greenland ice sheet. %$* 366
the earth’s fever is only getting worse and the animals and the plants that are out there struggling are already giving us the early warning signs. %$* 366
we’ve seen them shift their habitats and we’ve seen them struggle as they cope with the shifting of the period, the warm periods and the cold periods of the seasons. %$* 366
furthermore, there’s already heat in the pipeline as the oceans play catch-up to the atmosphere loading that we’ve put, these heat trapping gases in our atmosphere. %$* 366
as the oceans warm up, the temperatures will commit us to further warming. %$* 366
we’re locking in another degree of fahrenheit of warming. %$* 366
that’s heat in the pipeline. %$* 366
do we really want to lock in even further warming? %$* 366
we’re going to keep studying the symptoms of scie-, as scientists. %$* 366
but the diagnosis is very clear and the course of treatment is even clearer. %$* 366
choosing not to fight global warming is as foolhardy as ignoring the early warning signs of a fever of a young child and not attending to that. %$* 366
so what is the course of treatment and can we really do something about it? %$* 366
the answer is yes, but we have to act soon, we have to start tackling this problem on all fronts. %$* 366
our landfills, farms, and livestock are emitting methane and other heat trapping gases. %$* 366
our fossil fuels, our oil, our coal, our gas, cutting down forests, are committing us to ever increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, in fact, these levels of heat trapping gases are at the highest level than they’ve ever been for hundreds of thousands of years. %$* 366
it’s not natural. %$* 366
since the dawn of the industrial age, humans have been digging up carbon and putting it on fire, and using it as energy. %$* 366
now the earth doesn’t normally set on fire million year ol- , million year old stores of carbon, it’s unnatural. %$* 366
it’s not, it’s not a normal thing. %$* 366
what we’re doing by using these fossil fuels is overwhelming the earth’s capacity to clean up and absorb that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. %$* 366
the earth takes hundreds of years to get rid of carbon dioxide and what’s most important, is that this fact is very important to help us decide when we have to start acting about global warming. %$* 366
while some of the worst effects might not be felt for decades or centuries the actions we take today will determine how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere, how much global warming we are locking in, how bad are the effects going to be for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren. %$* 366
that’s what’s really important. %$* 366
we probably have a decade to institute meaningful solutions. %$* 366
why ten years? %$* 366
that’s because the decisions we make today have a long term commitment. %$* 366
if we do not reform our agriculture practices heat trapping gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. %$* 366
however, if we were to capture methane from our landfills, not only would we stop those emissions from going to the atmosphere, we would also be creating energy at the same time. %$* 366
if we make a building in the old way then we would be polluting for decades to come. %$* 366
however, if we were to build with renewable energy sources new cleaner buildings then that means that we have eliminated that fossil fuel loading of emissions to the atmosphere. %$* 366
if we construct coal power plants the conventional way that means we are substantially increasing the heat trapping emissions in our atmosphere for fifty years and they will linger for many, many more years. %$* 366
however, if we invest in research and technology to capture carbon from those coal plants this will would be welcome news to all the nations of the world that have deep, vast coal reserves. %$* 366
increasing energy efficiency and harnessing renewable energy from the sun, from the wind, from other sources will help us along this path. %$* 366
if our cities continue to grow, that increase the commuting distance of our citizens, that means we are committing ourselves to burning more fuel. %$* 366
there are better ways. %$* 366
with profitable solutions at hand it’s irresponsible to postpone action. %$* 366
right now we could put nations on target to reducing emissions. %$* 366
if we start now we reduce each year. %$* 366
however, if we delay that means that the cuts that we have to make to meet our goals will become steeper and steeper and we may not even be able to meet those demands. %$* 366
they will become too hard for us to reach. %$* 366
it’s the equivalent to the person with a credit card who can no longer pay off the minimum payments, that cannot reach their goals. %$* 366
right now we’re on a spending spree with our heat trapping emissions. %$* 366
we’re building up the future costs of global warming. %$* 366
and – %$* 366
and when this bill comes, uh, when the bill for our emissions today comes, comes due in the not too distant future, um, choosing not to fight global warming is about as irresponsible as not making payments on a high interest credit card. %$* 366
with such high stakes common sense requires that we act now and while we still have options. %$* 366
um, within the next decade we will continue to determine whether or not our children and grandchildren look back at this time and decide whether we failed them. %$* 366
or will they look back at this time and see that built a better planet for ourselves and for them? %$* 366
we have a chance to avert this crisis and to assure a safer planet. %$* 366
and if we wait for the children to solve this problem it’s too late. %$* 366
the risks are too big. %$* 366
but before we act on the global warming – %$* 366
we must recognize it for the crisis that it is. %$* 366
vote no. %$* 366
one. %$* 79
and when this bill comes, uh, when the bill for our emissions today comes, comes due in the not too distant future, um, choosing not to fight global warming is about as irresponsible as not making payments on a high interest credit card. %$* 366

and if we wait for the children to solve this problem it’s too late. %$* 366
the risks are too big. %$* 366
but before we act on the global warming – %$* 366
brenda ekwurzel, thank you very much. %$* 79
we must recognize it for the crisis that it is. %$* 366
vote no. %$* 366
and thank all our panelists for their initial presentations. %$* 79
i am now ready to announce the results of the pre- debate vote, rounded to the nearest whole number. %$* 79
those for the motion that global warming is not a crisis, were 30% of you. %$* 79
those against the motion were 57% of you, those undecided, were 13% of you. %$* 79
not worthy of snickering, those 13 percent. %$* 79
or, more precisely, 29.88% for, 57.32% against, and 12.8% undecided. %$* 79
so we’re now ready to begin the q-and-a portion of the program, i will call on the questioners, someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone when you raise your hands. %$* 79
i will be looking for, from you, challenging questions for the pro side and for the anti side. %$* 79
uh, if you can identify yourselves that way, uh, to the people with the microphones that would be good. %$* 79
um, if some of you don’t fit into that category that’s okay too. %$* 79
uh, we’re gonna mix in my questions and your questions and to the panelists, um, i hope to keep a good pace here because by the rules we have 20 minutes only, and there is so much to follow up on. %$* 79
also %$* 79
audience members, uh, please do not start to ask your question until you have a microphone. %$* 79
please make your questions short and to the point, please, 30 seconds if you can, and, the more focused your question, the more likely you are to be on npr.so— there you go. %$* 79
okay. %$* 79
brenda ekwurzel, and richard lindzen. %$* 79
can i get the two of you to engage for up to two minutes on one thing i noticed in your conversations, in your presentations, um %$* 79
richard lindzen, you seemed to say that warming could make the climate more stable. %$* 79
brenda, you seemed to suggest, that it would make it less stable. %$* 79
richard lindzen, i’ll start with you, and talk to each other. %$* 79
are you arguing that global warming could be good for the earth? %$* 79
yeah, of course it could be. %$* 362
that’s, uh, goes without question. %$* 362
there’s no reason to assume we’re at the optimum for climate. %$* 362
it’s been all over the place— %$* 362
but it’s the climate that we have adapted to, it’s the climate that has led us to put— %$* 365
it may be— %$* 362
—battery park city right at the waterline, that’s the problem— %$* 365
gavin schmidt, thank you, let him, let him— hang on, hang on, hang on, well— let him finish your thought, go ahead, richard lindzen— %$* 79
what i was referring to was the issue of variability. %$* 362
and that depends basically on the pole-to-equator temperature difference. %$* 362
and since the models are suggesting that the warming would be greater at the poles, then you are reducing the equator to pole- temperature difference, you’re increasing the—decreasing the forcing for storms, and you’re decreasing the range. %$* 362
brenda ekwurzel? %$* 79
yes, i think the risks are gonna grow, we know this with the warming of the planet further. %$* 366
and furthermore, if we have those risks that means that governments are gonna spend much more money, hand over fist, bailing out farmers that are suffering from more extreme draught, we have arable lands growing— %$* 366
look— %$* 103
—uh, stuff like this— %$* 366
but they’d have less water source— %$* 103
—this is gonna be—and less money for fighting poverty and all those other aspects that are important— %$* 366
philip stott, you wanted to get in here? %$* 79
just to say i did find gavin’s comment a little amusing because in fact 8,000 years ago, at a peak of warming much higher than today, you know what the climate people call it? %$* 103
the climate optimum. %$* 103
in other words it’s actually perceived as more optimal in terms of vegetation and other factors. %$* 103
not for people who own— %$* 365
gavin, go ahead and respond. %$* 79
not for people who own basement property in battery park city. %$* 365
a low-lying area of new york city for those of you living %$* 79
around the country. %$* 79
but i think that raises a really interesting issue because of course adaptation to change is always the way that humans have coped with it, in fact of course bad planning and bad building doesn’t excuse and is not proof of global warming. %$* 103
here’s a question for the anti side. %$* 79
a question for the anti side if i might, these 1970s headlines about global cooling. %$* 79
that always comes up as an inconvenient fact. %$* 79
i’ve almost got a title there. %$* 79
how do you explain that? %$* 79
who wants it. %$* 79
you know, that’s an—that’s the scientific equivalent of an urban legend and i’m shocked, that not— %$* 363
richard somerville. %$* 79
that not—not only, uh, did we hear it from michael crichton and philip stott but we heard it from the fourth member of the pro team, mr. %$* 363
rosenkranz, at the beginning. %$* 363
the—there wasn’t a scientific consensus in the ‘70s about global cooling. %$* 363
there was hype in the news media. %$* 363
quoting newsweek is not the right way to evaluate, uh, scientific thought, you can look it up. %$* 363
but, can i—can i answer that? %$* 362
wait, richard lindzen, go ahead? %$* 79
yeah. %$* 362
but, you know, the claim of consensus right now is also not based on a vote %$* 362
or anything else, and in fact it was invoked by newsweek in 1988 %$* 362
when they stated all scientists agree. %$* 362
but wait, on—do you agree on this 1970s global cooling thing, that that was media hype, richard lindzen? %$* 79
actually, i do not disagree with richard on that. %$* 362
thank you— %$* 363
i think it is true that the media amplified what was going on considerably, and that the field itself was in a much healthier state at that time and the open discussions were greater. %$* 362
philip stott, very briefly. %$* 79
yeah, what’s very amusing was, one scientist came out in 1970, a swedish scientist, and actually said we should pump out carbon dioxide to ensure that we didn’t go into global cooling. %$* 103
you know, you—you can always find, uh, people on the fringes— %$* 363
richard somerville, go ahead— %$* 79
you can always find people, uh, on the fringes, consensus doesn’t mean unanimity and science isn’t a democracy anyway but it’s not good to misrepresent, the situation when an overwhelming majority of genuine experts have come to conclusions opposed to some of those who’ve heard, uh, from the other side. %$* 363
so, so to the yes team %$* 79
michael crichton, you talked about, how consensus is sometimes wrong and it takes the individual to burst through the consensus. %$* 79
excuse me. %$* 79
um, this debate is set up three on three, as if everything were even. %$* 79
but in the real world out there, we just had the big inter- governmental panel on climate change report in which 90% of the world’s governments and 90% of their atmospheric sciences declared with 90% certainty, that global warming is real and human beings are causing it. %$* 79
why would you three be more credible to the non-scientists in our audience, than all of them? %$* 79
it—it’s %$* 364
this is always to me a very fascinating point. %$* 364
if, if we were to say, um, does the moon revolve around the earth, uh, we would say yes, and no one would ever, would ever preface that by saying, well, the consensus of scientists says this. %$* 364
you know, the, the notion of consensus is only a vote for very particular kinds of things, and to me it’s a serious warning signal. %$* 364
for example, ordinarily if i were to say the moon is full of green cheese, no one would, no one would vilify me or— they would take me out and prove to me that that wasn’t the case. %$* 364
it’s, it’s when there isn’t a very good and powerful counter-argument, that’s the first answer, the second answer is, is one i really like very much and it’s one einstein made. %$* 364
he, um %$* 364
there was a— the nazis decided that they would, uh, do something to demonstrate that german science was bad and they got 200, uh, german scientists to say that einstein was wrong and then somebody asked einstein, how does it feel to have 200 scientists against you. %$* 364
and he said, it takes only one to prove me wrong. %$* 364
all right, who on the anti side wants to respond. %$* 79
uh, gavin schmidt. %$* 79
okay. %$* 365
you’ve frequently stated that consensus is not science. %$* 365
and you know what, i agree with you. %$* 365
consensus is what’s left over, after the science has been done. %$* 365
consensus is what goes into the textbooks. %$* 365
the science is happening at the frontiers. %$* 365
it’s the filling in of the interesting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. %$* 365
it’s the, not—it’s not the overall picture, the big picture, is the stuff that everybody knows and everybody understands. %$* 365
your, your assessment of— you’re—you’re arguing that, because something is—people agree on it, you can’t possibly agree with it. %$* 365
it’s like saying, well if you disagree, then i’ll agree. %$* 365
no, i was— %$* 364
you’re saying you’ll never agree which means that you’re not listening to what the people are saying— %$* 365
yeah— %$* 79
—what am i saying again— %$* 364
michael, go ahead, i’m sorry? %$* 79
i’m not saying that the consensus is necessarily wrong, i’m only saying that consensus is not a—a clear proof that it’s right. %$* 364
and moreover, michael— %$* 362
of course not, no— %$* 103
—has made the point— %$* 362
richard lindzen on the same side, go— continue. %$* 79
lamont made the same statement, you don’t use consensus if you have a proof. %$* 362
what’s very important— %$* 103
philip stott, you wanna back that up further— %$* 79
yeah, quite, gavin right, you said, we should always be at the edge, the edge of science on climate change has nothing to do with co2, it’s to do with what we call cosmic rays, the relationship to the sun, and water vapor. %$* 103
anybody else on the anti side wanna come back on that? %$* 79
they all three got a—got a lick in there. %$* 79
i—it is— %$* 363
richard somerville— %$* 79
it is mind-boggling, to say that cosmic rays are the cause of, of climate change is to en—endorse one of the least proven, most tentative— %$* 363
i didn’t say that. %$* 103
oh, good, i’m glad— %$* 363
but then why—why did you bring it up. %$* 365
why did you bring it up, yeah— %$* 363
simply because there are a whole range of scientists who are working on this particular topic and they say it’s one of the big unknowns and a great deal of research has just been done on it. %$* 103
at the edge— %$* 103
but we’re—we’re talking about global warming, we’re talking about the trend in temperature that— %$* 365
gavin schmidt— %$* 79
—we’ve seen over the last 30 years. %$* 365
there has been no trend in cosmic rays. %$* 365
so any change that there might have been because of cosmic ray impacts on climate, can’t possibly have an impact on what’s been going on— %$* 365
the most famous— %$* 103
—in the last changes. %$* 365
but the most famous astrophysicist working on it say that it has. %$* 103
uh, he is wrong. %$* 365
okay— %$* 79
i’m sorry. %$* 365
we’re now ready to vote—no, i’m kidding. %$* 79
um, for— %$* 79
that’s a serious accusation against some very serious sci—some are infinitely better than any of us on this platform today. %$* 103
i’d like to meet the person— %$* 365
explain that— %$* 362
there are some very eminent scientists, professor jan veizer for example, uh, uh, nir sh—professor nir shaviv who won the young scientist of the year in israel two years ago, who are in fact arguing that 70% of, of climate change is primarily driven by cosmic rays working through water vapor and clouds. %$* 103
i’m not saying they’re right or wrong, they’re pointing however at the edge, to new research. %$* 103
you cannot dismiss that, because it’s a consensus for co2. %$* 103
gavin schmidt, one more time? %$* 79
okay, this is exactly what i was talking about. %$* 365
you see? %$* 365
now, it looks like we’re having a scientific argument, but, this is completely bogus. %$* 365
you don’t know that it’s bogus, but i know that it’s bogus, he knows that it’s bogus. %$* 365
you’re being led astray. %$* 365
you’ll forgive me, gavin %$* 362
if—if you seriously wish to maintain that, then you’d better explain why— %$* 362
richard lindzen— %$* 79
—between you and richard, you’ve made statements that are overtly untrue. %$* 362
and i’ll give you some. %$* 362
you say, the earth has been warmer—is warmer now than it has been for 1300 years. %$* 362
the national academy evaluating this said, the methodology was no use beyond 400 years. %$* 362
why do you make this statement. %$* 362
you keep on quoting these groups, and when they disagree with them, you make up the quote. %$* 362
i—i’ve gotta say that one, one thing at a time— %$* 365
gavin schmidt— %$* 79
—let’s deal with that. %$* 365
the national academy of science report said that we have good evidence that we’re warmer from 400 years ago, we have credible evidence that we’re warmer from 900— %$* 365
no, they did not— %$* 362
yes they did, richard, please— %$* 365
no, the— %$* 362
read the reports before— %$* 365
—front end—the front end said— %$* 362
read the—read more than the front page, richard— %$* 365
no, i’m saying the text, said it was not credible beyond 400 years— %$* 362
that’s not what it—that’s not what it said— %$* 365
moreover, moreover— %$* 363
right, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait— %$* 79
i can tell you why it’s not— %$* 365
we’re into “he said”-“he said.” but— but gavin schmidt, you seem to suggest that the other side does not have a real scientific argument, but a culturally or politically constructed one. %$* 79
you don’t think they’re sincere? %$* 79
that’s a very difficult question. %$* 365
i think—i— no, i, i do think that they’re sincere— %$* 365
you as much as said it. %$* 79
i don’t think that they are completely %$* 365
doing this on a level playing field that the people here will understand. %$* 365
and, there are %$* 365
well %$* 79
explain yourself, because—wait a minute— %$* 79
no, let me—let me explain, explain that— %$* 365
because they have larger cultural or political agendas? %$* 79
no, um, i have no idea what their political or cultural agendas are, and to be frank i’m not very interested. %$* 365
i’m left-wing and have no money whatsoever from any oil company— %$* 103
okay, and— %$* 365
—and i wouldn’t. %$* 103
that’s fine. %$* 365
that’s fine. %$* 365
but i’m, i’m— %$* 365
all right— %$* 79
—i’m not interested in your motivations— %$* 365
but i know— %$* 103
all right— %$* 79
has interests. %$* 103
let’s go to the audience, and, when you ask your questions, uh, members of the press, please identify yourselves as such. %$* 79
members of the audience who are not with the press, you have the option to identify yourself, or not. %$* 79
okay. %$* 79
right down here. %$* 79
hi, my name is linda caro, um, it kind of surprises me that , uh, the emphasis is on co2 which is about one-third of 1% of the total atmosphere, whereas global—uh, water vapor is the vast bulk of it all. %$* 367
uh, is it possible that we are, um %$* 367
are not accounting properly for, uh, the giving off of heat such as nuclear power plants which are several thousand degrees centi—uh, fahrenheit, that we’re cooling with water and air, every day, every week, every month, every year, that can’t— %$* 367
is there anyone you would particularly like to answer that question? %$* 79
whoever feels most qualified. %$* 367
richard somerville is raising his hand. %$* 79
the, the direct heating from sources like power plants is negligible, uh, compared to these, these other factors, solar radiation, greenhouse effect. %$* 363
and the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor, primarily carbon dioxide and other gas is secondary, we can’t control water vapors. %$* 363
it’s controlled by the atmosphere itself, largely by temperature, so when you add co2, you humidify the atmosphere and the water adds to the warming. %$* 363
that’s one reason why richard lindzen’s talking about co2 only giving you a degree or so is disingenuous because that feedback is expected theoretically and has been observed. %$* 363
i think richard stott is, uh—philip stott is bursting out of his chair to agree with you. %$* 79
i could not agree more. %$* 103
yes, it’s governed by the atmosphere. %$* 103
absolutely, and is not under our control. %$* 103
but it’s— %$* 363
it is therefore one of the big factors, that we have no control over. %$* 103
it’s— %$* 363
in a non-linear couple system. %$* 103
i’m, i’m, i’m stunned by, by your amazement that non-linear coupled chaotic systems are things that we can’t understand even in part, that— %$* 363
he didn’t say that— %$* 362
i said—i said control. %$* 103
very—very good. %$* 363
you can control how much co2 you put in the atmosphere and that will have a big effect on how much water vapor is in the atmosphere, that’s not controversial. %$* 363
well you can’t predict— %$* 103
that is controversial— %$* 362
yeah. %$* 103
—and it’s controversial because it is not a homogeneous distribution of water vapor. %$* 362
yeah, exactly. %$* 103
and, you know, to pretend this is settled, is bizarre. %$* 362
moreover with clouds, which are comparably important, you know full well, that that is not settled. %$* 362
let us— %$* 79
by a long shot. %$* 362
—go to another questioner from the audience— %$* 79
down on this side in the front. %$* 79
uh, andy revkin from the new york times, this is, this is kind of neat to, to listen to. %$* 368
did i hear a hiss? %$* 79
ssss. %$* 368
back atcha. %$* 368
um, i’ve been writing about this for a long time. %$* 368
uh, most every aspect of it. %$* 368
so my question is, uh, one about the hedging, managing risk came up before, which is not what you think of when you think of crisis and catastrophe. %$* 368
my—my sense is that there’s one thing that everyone has agreed on, at least—except maybe philip, which is that, more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer. %$* 368
is there anyone other than philip who disagrees with that— %$* 368
i don’t disagree with it. %$* 103
okay, you did it—yeah, so, we all—i love to find the things we agree on. %$* 368
um, so everyone agrees, more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer. %$* 368
uh, the doubling is, is a step on the staircase we’re—we’re heading on toward tripling or quadrupling, i think everyone would mostly agree that if we go to nine billion people, all of whom would love to have our level of affluence, we’re going in that direction. %$* 368
and so, as a hedging exercise, if it weren’t costly to slow the pace, beyond the jesse ausubel very slow decarbonization, if we could find a new way that didn’t cost a lot, that actually could give energy for those developing countries that crave it, and limit emissions at the same time, would anyone on the pro side think that it’s a bad idea to stop emitting greenhouse gases, if there were a solution. %$* 368
michael crichton, you’re shaking your head no? %$* 79
no— %$* 364
as a hedge— %$* 368
—no, i don’t think anybody objects, uh, the, the, the question is whether or not you’re gonna spend what bjorn lomberg thinks which is $558 trillion and i think, if in fact it’s going to prove to be that kind of enormous construction project, then that should not be the first priority right this minute. %$* 364
but no, i don’t— %$* 364
so let me pursue andy revkin’s stab at striking a consensus on what to do. %$* 79
for the anti side %$* 79
if this is a crisis, what kind of lifestyle change, what kind of economic pain, and how quickly are you proposing %$* 79
to hedge our bets? %$* 79
brenda ekwurzel. %$* 79
as soon as possible because— %$* 366
but what? %$* 79
everything, everything that we can throw at solving this climate crisis—well, this climate problem, is important because, every day that we emit carbon dioxide means that it will last for many, many centuries, and so we have to start weaning ourselves off of ways of emitting more methane, more nitrous oxide, all the heat- trapping gases, not just carbon dioxide, it’s the ones that have long life, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, that are very, very important, in the short term methane is very important ‘cause it has such heat-trapping potential. %$* 366
but forgive me— %$* 79
and so, landfills— %$* 366
—but the question from— %$* 79

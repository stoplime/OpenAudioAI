hi, i'm lorelei. %$* 19
so quick question for either side, what would change your mind to go to the reverse? %$* 19
what would change your mind? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
how could the other guys convince you? %$* 13
what would have to happen. %$* 19
i think-- %$* 13
a large cash deposit in my name-- %$* 200
a swiss bank under my name, $10 million. %$* 200
the same thing that's caused me to change my mind-- %$* 199
lawrence krauss. %$* 13
all the times i've been wrong. %$* 199
and i've been wrong many more times than dinesh, i'm sure. %$* 199
a single shred of evidence, that's all. %$* 199
other side. %$* 13
you know, i'm not even sure i could be persuaded unless we changed the meaning of what science is because coming back to the previous question, how would you measure the beauty of an orchid scientifically? %$* 202
i think, really, science sets itself out, in a way, to fail. %$* 202
and don't forget the motion is "science refutes god," not that, you know, "there is no god," but that science refutes god. %$* 202
well, in a way we do measure beauty. %$* 200
the marketplace of people that buy flowers, essentially, determine how the breeders create them, based on the ones that most people find really beautiful. %$* 200
there actually is a measurable way for that. %$* 200
all right. %$* 13
that was a great question, by the way. %$* 13
thanks a lot. %$* 13
on this side. %$* 13
hi, my name is mike. %$* 18
i live on the upper west side; i'm not from here, obviously. %$* 18
this is a question to ian and dinesh. %$* 18
is there an observed phenomena for which the religious explanation has progressed ahead of the scientific explanation in terms of plausibility? %$* 18
i'll answer that. %$* 201
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
if you look at the bible, it is not a science manual; it doesn't claim to make scientific proofs. %$* 201
in fact, what's interesting about the bible is it doesn't make proofs at all. %$* 201
the bible doesn't even attempt to prove god; it doesn't try to prove that jesus is the son of god; it asserts things. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because for the most part, what the bible is doing is it's in the province of revelation. %$* 201
now, you'll notice that neither of us have ever in this debate appealed to the bible to support any argument that we made. %$* 201
we have argued on the basis of reason alone. %$* 201
now, the bible does make certain claims about the world and about man. %$* 201
so, for example, the bible doesn't say that god made man out of nothing, but it does say that god made the universe out of nothing; it says that it made man out of some other stuff. %$* 201
now, so the bible says god created the world and god created man, but the bible doesn't say how. %$* 201
so that's where science comes in. %$* 201
science can, and the scientific answer often changes, attempt to give explanations that actually don't refute the bible. %$* 201
you could refute the bible by showing that, actually, the universe has always existed and doesn't require any explanation whatsoever. %$* 201
you could show that god didn't make man out of the clay of the ground, but, as richard dawkins said," aliens brought man from outer space." so you can actually refute propositions that are stated in the bible-- %$* 201
let me-- %$* 13
but i think ian's right that no central proposition has ever been refuted, let alone today. %$* 201
lawrence has had his head in his hand listening to this. %$* 13
well, i mean, i-- %$* 199
you know, you don't really want to-- %$* 199
you don't really want to go here, dinesh. %$* 199
so i would say, for example, we refute the bible by arguing that creating day and night before you create the sun is pretty silly. %$* 199
well, lawrence, in that case-- %$* 201
here's the problem: you have a fundamentalist reading of the bible that has-- %$* 201
hold on-- %$* 201
that maybe-- %$* 201
that is maybe subscribed to by 3 percent of christians and 100 percent of atheists. %$* 201
but you just gave a fundamentalist-- %$* 199
no, but you just gave-- %$* 199
you just-- %$* 199
that-- %$* 199
why i brought that up, because i thought you were essentially repeating a fundamentalist assertion that, somehow, the bible makes some scientific claims that are substantial. %$* 199
and the whole point is you don't want to go there, because you and i know that a fundamentalist interpretation of the bible leads to nonsense. %$* 199
we both agree about that, right? %$* 199
we both agree that there are fundamentalist factual claims that are so-called "creation science" that are nonsense. %$* 201
we agree on that. %$* 201
so that-- %$* 199
so that case is science refutes those claims. %$* 199
absolutely. %$* 201
okay. %$* 199
well you just answered this question. %$* 199
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: science refutes god. %$* 13
ian hutchinson wants to pick up-- %$* 13
well, i do want to come back and try to answer this question. %$* 202
and the import of that question was that theology as such has made no contribution to human knowledge or development; and that's a claim that lawrence has made in his book, okay? %$* 202
in the last 500 years or so, yeah. %$* 199
yeah, so the last 500 years. %$* 202
and i just want to make one comment on that. %$* 202
if you said-- %$* 202
just as an example, if you think about the reformation; the reformation probably brought about the biggest transformation of human learning, knowledge, of the entire recorded history. %$* 202
and what caused the reformation? %$* 202
well, i guess luther. %$* 202
oh, what was luther? %$* 202
hmm, a theologian. %$* 202
and i can add to this. %$* 201
so right now, when we deal with war, all western war is conducted according to the principles of the just war. %$* 201
that's why, for example, after 9/11, when america was bombing taliban targets, we were dropping food to feed civilians on the enemy side. %$* 201
now, where does the idea that you can kill combatants but not civilians come from? %$* 201
did science teach us that? %$* 201
nonsense. %$* 201
question %$* 13
it comes straight out of christianity, the principles of the just war that guide the knowledge of how we act today. %$* 201
question over on the far side, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name's john. %$* 18
and earlier in the debate, we were talking about how science can prove or establish what is right and wrong. %$* 18
my question for you, mr. %$* 18
krauss, is how does science tell us that the publishing of the man before his death went publish-- %$* 18
when pushed in front of the train is right or wrong. %$* 18
do you understand? %$* 18
well-- %$* 199
i don't. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
earlier in the debate we were talking about how science can tell us what is right or wrong. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
my question for mr. %$* 18
krauss is that how can science tell us that the publishing of the picture of the man before his death when pushed in front of a train is right or wrong? %$* 18
i know. %$* 199
yesterday's-- %$* 199
okay, well, you know, we-- %$* 199
we've got to step back for a second. %$* 199
and my point was that-- %$* 199
lawrence, is this going to take us in a relevant direction? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 199
i'll try and answer in 10 or 15 seconds. %$* 199
and you can decide. %$* 199
all right. %$* 13
the point is-- %$* 199
i might decide in advance. %$* 13
ten seconds. %$* 13
precognition. %$* 199
the point is that you can't decide what is right or wrong unless you know the consequences of your actions. %$* 199
science determines the consequences of your actions. %$* 199
so a precursor to determining to what's right or wrong is to know how the world really works. %$* 199
for example, if you thought the person was pushed on the train would be hit by the train and then get up and walk away, you'd have very different actions. %$* 199
and so that's what i mean by ultimately understanding how the universe works as a precursor to making decisions to making moral decisions. %$* 199
okay. %$* 13
21 seconds. %$* 13
sir, right down here. %$* 13
can you stand up and wait for the microphone, please. %$* 13
you will be our youngest ever questioner. %$* 13
there is no pressure on you whatsoever. %$* 13
my name is david. %$* 18
and i'm a student at collegiate school. %$* 18
and i would like to know, from a-- %$* 18
the side for the motion, whether-- %$* 18
what your stance would be-- %$* 18
or what you would say to somebody that has a spiritual experience, not really-- %$* 18
let's let michael shermer take that question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 200
so we get this a lot. %$* 200
you know, how do you explain this or that? %$* 200
i think people's experiences are real, absolutely. %$* 200
i think most people don't just make up stories, although some do. %$* 200
most people when they experience what they describe some miraculous, fantastic spiritual experience that they've had, they really mean it. %$* 200
now, so the question is, what does it represent? %$* 200
something out there in the world or something inside the brain? %$* 200
well, we now know enough about neuroscience to know that the brain does generate a lot of these kind of spiritual experiences, near death experiences, out of body experiences, sense presences, hallucinations, delusions. %$* 200
there's whole books about this. %$* 200
and so the experiences are real. %$* 200
what we want to know as scientists is what do they actually represent. %$* 200
i mean, we know we can replicate these in the lab by doing certain things and causing people's brains to have these experiences. %$* 200
so most likely, the what's more likely question, that it's out there or that it's in here. %$* 200
the overwhelming evidence is that they're in here. %$* 200
good question. %$* 13
and i want to actually take it to the other side. %$* 13
michael is basically arguing that some of those things that you're talking about it's your brain talking to you but not in the way that you think it is. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
well, hallucinations, yes. %$* 201
i mean, if someone said that they saw a ufo, i would say, how do you know? %$* 201
and they might say, well, i was with my buddies. %$* 201
we were sitting outside our trailer park. %$* 201
we were drinking beer. %$* 201
and i would say, well, yeah, i probably won't believe that. %$* 201
but we're talking here about an experience that has been had by perhaps 90 percent of people in the world from the beginning of time. %$* 201
that's a different standard-- %$* 201
what experience do you mean? %$* 13
having a sense of spiritual-- %$* 13
well, having a sense of some experience of god. %$* 201
okay. %$* 13
right? %$* 201
so i would put the likelihood this way. %$* 201
if we went to a village, and there were a hundred people in the village, and 95 of them said that they knew a guy named bill, and there were 5 percent of the guys who said, nah, and three of them thought that the other 95 were lying or made him up, which is more likely? %$* 201
that there is a bill and yet 95 percent of people are hallucinating or is it that there is a bill, and 5 percent just don't know the guy. %$* 201
the universality of the experience-- %$* 201
the universality of the experience of god puts a heavy burden of proof on the other side to show that the mass of the human race not in some incidental but a central aspect of their lives. %$* 201
remember, people invest money in religion. %$* 201
they go to church. %$* 201
they leave inheritances. %$* 201
they follow the credos of religion, that they are all hallucinating? %$* 201
who said "wow"? %$* 13
do you mind turning your "wow" into a question if we bring a mic to you? %$* 13
you don't mind? %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
or, you're right, that was just your guffaw. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i would love to so right behind you. %$* 13
the quick answer is that there are bills, and we've seen bills. %$* 200
michael shermer. %$* 13
so the that's different than an invisible god that may or may not exist. %$* 200
and the point is when you say the experience, you mean a personal-- %$* 199
some internal perception that god exists. %$* 199
and-- %$* 199
and the fact that something is maybe relatively universal suggests that we may be programmed to believe in certain things. %$* 199
but it doesn't mean-- %$* 199
because that doesn't mean they exist just because as michael was talking about earlier, our evolutional history programs us to have certain tendencies. %$* 199
and there's no doubt-- %$* 199
you'd be crazy to suggest that humans don't have a tendency to be religious. %$* 199
that would violate evidence of reality. %$* 199
so the fact that humans have a tendency to be religious is not-- %$* 199
or a belief in god is not proof that god exists. %$* 199
it's just proof that humans have a tendency. %$* 199
okay. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is linda drum. %$* 19
my question is for this side. %$* 19
the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
we have had many gods as civilization began. %$* 19
they've been taken away as we've been able-- %$* 19
as science has been able to explain something like fire. %$* 19
we had the god of fire, science came along and said, well, it's not really god. %$* 19
you do this. %$* 19
you rub two sticks together, we understand the process behind it, so therefore it's not a god. %$* 19
it's science. %$* 19
my question to you is this. %$* 19
you keep talking about christianity. %$* 19
i understand that religion and god are intertwined. %$* 19
but can you separate the two? %$* 19
and if you can, can you say, why is it necessary to believe in god? %$* 19
aside from religion, why is it important that we believe in god? %$* 19
i'm going to pass on the question again because i don't think it moves us on this topic of science. %$* 13
but it was actually a great question. %$* 13
and makes me think we should have a debate on that they topic. %$* 13
ma'am, right there. %$* 13
all right, yes. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
just wait for the mic, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thanks a lot. %$* 13
i'm loud, but-- %$* 19
if-- %$* 19
if you-- %$* 19
do you believe that your christianity is absolute and true, or do you feel that you need to make a leap of faith there? %$* 19
and is a leap of faith scientific? %$* 19
well done. %$* 13
so can i take this one at least to begin with? %$* 202
ian hutchinson. %$* 13
yes, i think faith is an important topic that we haven't touched on. %$* 202
and humans make decisions on the basis of incomplete evidence all the time during our lives. %$* 202
and it's people who act boldly and with determination and commitment who are the people who, in the end, are most successful in life. %$* 202
they act on the evidence that they have, even though that evidence is incomplete. %$* 202
and that is, as far as i can see, an explanation of what is-- %$* 202
or at least part of what is meant by faith. %$* 202
faith is that same principle of acting on the evidence we know, even though it's not complete, applied to matters of the spirit. %$* 202
if i can add a big thought to that, it is-- %$* 201
you ask if its scientific, and i would say no. %$* 201
faith is not scientific. %$* 201
but faith is completely rational. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because where empirical evidence can't go, it's not unreasonable to believe on faith. %$* 201
let's say, for example, you're making any kind of a decision, whether to invest in brazil or whether to propose marriage. %$* 201
you bring in all the evidence you can. %$* 201
and yet if you're asking the question, will i make money? %$* 201
or what will life be like with this woman over the next 30 years? %$* 201
you're never going to have a full answer. %$* 201
now, you can say, "i'll be an agnostic and wait for the data to come in." but the data will never come in. %$* 201
she'll marry someone else, and you'll both be dead. %$* 201
so you put in all the knowledge you can, and the leap of faith is a completely rational bridge from knowledge to action. %$* 201
lawrence krauss. %$* 13
as i said, in science we talk about likely and unlikely. %$* 199
in science, of course, and in life, we do, i agree, make decisions based on incomplete evidence. %$* 199
but the wonderful thing about science, the thing that makes science so much better than religion is our faith is shakable. %$* 199
i am proud of the fact that there's something i can believe with all my heart to be absolutely true and the minute there's a bit of evidence that shows it isn't true, i throw it out like yesterday's newspaper. %$* 199
in fact, that's the one thing i recommend, i hope every student has in their experiences sometime in their life, something that they profoundly believe in to be true based on faith shown to be wrong because that opens their mind. %$* 199
and that's what science does that religion doesn't. %$* 199
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
where our motion is "science refutes god." and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
those statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and, remember, the audience, you voted before the debate, and this is their last chance to change your mind before you vote a second time to pick the winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is, "science refutes god." and here to summarize his position against this motion, ian hutchinson, professor of nuclear science and engineering at mit. %$* 13
although it is incompetent to refute god or religion, science is very important. %$* 202
it's our way of finding out about the regularities of the universe and this amazing natural world in which we live. %$* 202
and i think both sides can agree that we deplore the widespread ignorance of science. %$* 202
and we want americans of all persuasions to understand science better. %$* 202
and if you share that viewpoint, then here's why you should vote against this motion. %$* 202
claiming more for science than is warranted by its competence does not promote science; it damages it. %$* 202
talking as if science is all the real knowledge there is, that-- %$* 202
as this scientistic motion does, alienates from science people who know better than to accept such an unjustified metaphysical extrapolation. %$* 202
it alienates intellectuals, particularly from other nonscientific disciplines, and so gives rise to the culture wars that have roiled the academy for the last few decades. %$* 202
and it alienates nonintellectuals whose opinions are more intuitive and practical but who know that their life is more than some reductionistic description in terms of atoms and molecules. %$* 202
people who make aggressive anti-theistic claims on behalf of science are not acting as science's champions; they are bringing it into disrepute. %$* 202
they are confusing science with scientism, perhaps for their own polemic purposes. %$* 202
and they are in the end misrepresenting science to the public, and, therefore, i urge you, whatever may be your religious beliefs, to vote against this erroneous motion. %$* 202
thank you, ian hutchinson. %$* 13
our motion is "science refutes god," and here to speak in support of the motion, michael shermer. %$* 13
he is the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and a columnist for scientific american. %$* 13
when i was a christian and i matriculated at pepperdine university, i was in what i call the "bubble." i was in the bubble where everybody around you believes. %$* 200
and in that bubble, the christian worldview like any other worldview is internally consistent. %$* 200
it's inherently logical. %$* 200
it's reinforced by everybody around you until you step outside of the bubble. %$* 200
what happened with me is i went to graduate school and i started to study social psychology, anthropology, psychology, and beliefs, and so on. %$* 200
and there i realized that none of those arguments actually make sense in and of themselves, the arguments for god's existence. %$* 200
what became clear to me is that what happens is, is you arrive at beliefs for non-rational, non-smart reasons, and then you back into it after the fact with rational reasons to justify it. %$* 200
we call this the "confirmation bias." and so for me i think there's overwhelming evidence that i've given you tonight that there's good anthropological social science reasons why people believe in god that, that doesn't prove there's a god, that it proves that we create gods in our heads. %$* 200
in addition to that, i don't think there's any evidence to support that there actually is a god out there separate from our beliefs. %$* 200
but finally my final point is this, is that i don't even think it's possible for there to be a god, at least not a supernatural god in this way, if god is supernatural, that is, outside of the space and time, there's no way for us to know it. %$* 200
therefore, whatever god is, it would have to be a natural being or at least some kind of a being that reaches in to stir the particles, and if he does, then we should be able to measure it, because that's what we do as scientists. %$* 200
we measure the motions of particles. %$* 200
and so far we have no evidence of that. %$* 200
so, therefore, i think that the most we could hope to find would be some kind of a natural being, in which case it would just become part of science, and that would be the end of the whole god concept. %$* 200
so if you agree with me that the evidence points in that direction, that we constructed gods and not vice versa, i would urge you to vote on our side for the proposition that "science refutes god." %$* 200
thank you, michael shermer. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "science refutes god." and here to summarize his position against the motion, dinesh d'souza; he is the bestselling author of "what's so great about christianity? %$* 13
" and he is the director of "2016, obama's america." %$* 13
if science refutes god, you'd expect the one person who would know that would be charles darwin. %$* 201
charles darwin has supplied modern atheism with perhaps the strongest argument against god, evolution. %$* 201
and yet, when darwin published his evolution theory, the harvard botanist-- %$* 201
the american botanist asa gray wrote darwin a letter in which he said, "as a christian, i was very inspired upon reading your book, because i have read in the book of genesis that god made the world and god made man, but there's no information about how this might've occurred. %$* 201
and when i read your book, i understood not only why god made humans, but why there's so much suffering in the world. %$* 201
evolution helps to account for the reason why there's suffering both for humans, but also in the animal kingdom."darwin was so thrilled at receiving this letter that he published it in future editions of "the origin of species." so, in other words, for darwin, what actually caused him to lose his own faith, which he did, had nothing to do with evolution. %$* 201
according to darwin's biographers, and there are many of them, darwin lost his faith because he lost one of his daughters, annie. %$* 201
it was a terrible, unexpected death, and darwin blamed god for it and turned against god. %$* 201
it was the issue of suffering, not science, that turned darwin against god. %$* 201
now, we're debating here has science refuted god? %$* 201
and at some senses, we've been talking past each other. %$* 201
if i take a pot of water and put it on the stove, what am i trying to do? %$* 201
i'm trying to make a cup of tea. %$* 201
now, lawrence krauss would come along and say that the molecules are heating up, he could give a full scientific account of what's going on, but he would've completely missed the purpose behind what i'm doing. %$* 201
the scientific explanation doesn't refute the purposeful explanation, it coexists alongside it, and so it is with god. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
"science refutes god" is our motion, and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, lawrence krauss. %$* 13
he is a theoretical physicist and director of the origins project at arizona state university. %$* 13
human beings were clearly programmed by evolution to impute intentionality to the world around them. %$* 199
meaning and purpose was infused in all everyday events to make sense of a dangerous, difficult, and uncaring world, so we had rituals behind the sun, the moon, the planets, the wind, the earth, the oceans, in all societies. %$* 199
the rise of our physical understanding has slowly caused us to do away with those many gods; we no longer have mars, the god of war, poseidon, the greek god of the sea, thor, the god of storms. %$* 199
as michael has said, everyone here, or maybe everyone, is now an atheist with respect to those gods, and there's a reason for that. %$* 199
science has taught us that instead of capricious beings, there's an order to nature, and that order does not appear to involve a divinity. %$* 199
there's no need for a divinity; laws of nature describable bymathematics make predictions that allow us to-- %$* 199
not only to predict the future, but control it, without the need for any supernatural shenanigans. %$* 199
and, in fact, it amazes me that asking the question, "is god necessary? %$* 199
" is somehow an evil thing. %$* 199
when we stop asking questions, that will be an evil thing. %$* 199
science has taught us also that we want to believe, in the words of fox mulder. %$* 199
and we should be skeptical of those desires. %$* 199
as the physicist richard feynman told us, the easiest people to fool are ourselves. %$* 199
as scientist, we have to train ourselves to be skeptical of wanting to believe. %$* 199
and we should try and overcome our natural tendency to assume special significance to events. %$* 199
and human being are also inevitably programmed to ask, "why? %$* 199
" as we've heard it. %$* 199
but the "why? %$* 199
" question is ill-posed, because it presumes purpose; it presumes the answer to the question before you ask the question. %$* 199
what if there is no purpose? %$* 199
does there need to be purpose? %$* 199
and science tells us there's no evidence of purpose. %$* 199
so the "why? %$* 199
" question is ill-posed. %$* 199
our opponents want to keep the clock from ticking by avoiding the evidence of reality; and, therefore, science, by telling us there's no need for purpose, has refuted the need for god, and that's why you should support our position. %$* 199
thank you. %$* 13

and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time for you to judge which team has voted-- %$* 13
now it's time for you to judge which team has argued best. %$* 13
we're asking you, again, to go to the key pads at your seat that registered your vote, as it did at the beginning. %$* 13
and we're doing to get the read out almost instantaneously. %$* 13
as before, if you are with the motion, for the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you're against, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, or became undecided, or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll keep the voting open for about another 20 seconds, everybody okay with that? %$* 13
okay, we're going to lock out the voting. %$* 13
oh, wait, i got somebody-- %$* 13
somebody's still working on it. %$* 13
indecision is a terrible thing. %$* 13
we're good? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
yeah, okay. %$* 13
all right, first of all-- %$* 13
first of all, i want to thank this panel of debaters for being so energetic, honest, intelligent. %$* 13
they brought it all. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
also want to thank everyone who asked a question. %$* 13
the questions were really terrific tonight. %$* 13
also, the folks who asked questions and i didn't take them, there's no dishonor in that; i appreciate that you had the courage to get up and do this, so thank you to everybody who got up and asked a question today. %$* 13
the people who have been tweeting, you can keep going. %$* 13
if you want to tweet afterwards, our twitter handle is @iq2us and the hashtag for this event is #scivgod, that's s-c-i-v-- %$* 13
as in versus-- %$* 13
god, all in one word. %$* 13
so to everybody who enjoyed themselves, we want you to know that we do this every month and it's always this good, although we do all different kinds of topics, but we get very, very smart people up here on the stage to do this, to engage, really, to pay each other the respect of listening to each other's arguments, if only to demolish them, but they do it, they listen. %$* 13
they listen and that' a rare thing, and it lets you have the opportunity of really hearing two sides well-articulated. %$* 13
so want to talk a little bit, very briefly, about next season. %$* 13
we're going to be back here at the kaufmann theater, we'll be debating nuclear iran; genetic engineering; america's dollar policy, whether we need a strong dollar or not; the future of the republican party; and the food and drug administration, where we're going to be looking at the issue of whether the rules that are in place for safety are actually hazardous to the health of americans. %$* 13
our first debate is coming up on wednesday, january 16th. %$* 13
the motion that we're going with is "israel can live with a nuclear iran." in support of that motion, james dobbins; he's a former assistant secretary of state and a special envoy in the clinton and bush administrations; he's now a director at rand. his partner will be reuben he's a senior military affairs analyst for haaretz, the israeli newspaper; he was also once a fighter pilot in the israeli air force. %$* 13
against the motion he's the director of studies at the institute for policy and strategy and a former israeli intelligence officer. %$* 13
his partner is jeffrey goldberg, the award-winning journalist and national correspondent for the atlantic. %$* 13
all journalists appear to be award-winning-- %$* 13
said the three-time emmy award winning-- %$* 13
if you can't-- %$* 13
if you can't be in the audience for that, as you know from your participation tonight, there are a lot of ways that people out there can watch us, and you can, too. %$* 13
you can watch the live stream on fora.tv or listen to the debates on npr, here in new york city that's on wnyc. and you can also watch them on wnet, the world digital channel, starting in january, on pbs stations across the nation. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the results are coming in now. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i just needed to digest. %$* 13
and i want to put my glasses on for this. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so it's all in, i have been given the results. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes the most minds is declared the victor. %$* 13
and here it is: before the debate, 37 percent agreed with the motion, 34 percent were against, and 29 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, the team that has the highest percentage change is declared the winner. %$* 13
in the second vote, let's go first to the team that was arguing for the motion. %$* 13
their number went from 37 percent to 50 percent. %$* 13
that's a 13 percent increase. %$* 13
so the team arguing against the motion has to do better than 13 percent. %$* 13
let's see how they did. %$* 13
before the vote, 34 percent, the second vote, 38 percent, that's up 4 percent. %$* 13
it's not enough. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, "science refutes god," has won the debate. %$* 13
congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

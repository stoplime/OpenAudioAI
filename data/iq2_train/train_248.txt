so we are, as i said before, delighted for the first time ever for intelligence squared u.s.to be partnering with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
we started talking about this months ago. %$* 13
we worked through a lot of topics. %$* 13
we found out-- %$* 13
we came to the conclusion that this was the one that was really going to be the one that fit both our sets of values and agendas for the kinds of things that we need to be out there in the public discourse. %$* 13
and for that reason, at this point, i would like to bring to the stage, representing the mccain institute, ambassador kurt volker. %$* 13
let's welcome him to the stage. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 117
as you heard, my name is kurt volker. %$* 117
i'm the executive director of the mccain institute. %$* 117
we are a part of arizona state university, and this event is not only on radio but being live streamed back to arizona, watched by students there on asu tv, among other things. %$* 117
one of the missions that the mccain institute set for itself as we established ourselves over a year ago was to bring back a culture of reasoned structured debate about the core challenges facing our country. %$* 117
we embarked on a series of debates. %$* 117
one on syria, should we intervene or not; one on afghanistan, should we be getting out or not; what do we do about iran? %$* 117
and this was the first time that we are partnering with intelligence squared. %$* 117
and we are delighted to be able to do so. %$* 117
it should be a very lively debate about a critical issue that is, again, facing our country: what do we do about our defense budget? %$* 117
we'll be doing more of these in the fall as well. %$* 117
senator mccain wishes that he could be here for this debate at the beginning, but as you may know they’re dealing with immigration issues on capitol hill this evening, and so he’s over there for that. %$* 117
we do hope that he would be able to join and say a few words by the end. %$* 117
with that, i want to turn it back to our intelligence squared organizers and thank you all very much for coming. %$* 117
thank you, and normally what we do in new york at this point is i invite to this stage the person who brought intelligence squared us to new york and increasingly to the nation, and he helps frame what’s a hit for us in terms of the debate and the timing, why we’re going to this topic now. %$* 13
so i would like to welcome to the state, warmly, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
so, bob, we've been around the country in the past year. %$* 13
we've been to chicago, we've been to aspen. %$* 13
a lot of the time we're in new york city. %$* 13
we're back in washington for the second time this year. %$* 13
i just want to very briefly touch on the notion of bringing to this process the kind of very structured debate with rules and rounds and timing and a winner and a loser. %$* 13
what does that bring to the discourse? %$* 13
well, i think the point, really, is that the debaters are forced to listen to the arguments on both sides. %$* 1
they're forced to respond in real time to challenges. %$* 1
they're forced to respond to facts that either support or undercut their positions. %$* 1
and they're trying to persuade an open-minded audience to change their minds. %$* 1
so in many ways, it's reminiscent of the debates on the floors of congress. %$* 1
exactly like the debates on the floors of congress. %$* 13
so let's talk a little bit about this debate that we're having right now in this era of mandatory cuts coming for the pentagon budget. %$* 13
the team that's arguing for this motion-- %$* 13
and the "for" side is saying that the cuts really are a threat to national security, or a gift to our enemies, as we're putting it. %$* 13
what do they have going for them in this argument? %$* 13
well, i think what they have going for them is the fact that we live in a very dangerous world. %$* 1
we live in a world where we're facing a much more assertive china. %$* 1
we live in a world where radical islam seems to be in the ascendancy, and many countries in the middle east. %$* 1
we live in a world where a lot of people who really wish us ill are trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. %$* 1
so we're in a very dangerous environment, and we need a very strong defense in order to be secure at home and exercise leadership abroad. %$* 1
and the team on the other side? %$* 13
team on the other side will say, well, even with these cuts, we are spending more than, i think, the next 13 countries combined on national defense. %$* 1
and that there is a lot of waste and inefficiency in the defense department. %$* 1
they're going to point to the fact that civilian employees in a bureaucratic kind of capacity have grown in numbers far faster than deployable forces. %$* 1
they're going to point to the fact that in a lot of procurement programs they're really driven by politics and job creation more than by any kind of strategic thought or necessity. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
a little bit of a preview. %$* 13
and let's now welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
so we're about to begin. %$* 13
and, as i mentioned, for the sake of the radio broadcast, there may be points in the broadcast where i repeat certain things over and over again like telling you that my name is john donvan; that would be because we're coming back from breaks. %$* 13
and also it will be helpful when we come back from breaks if i could encourage you to applaud spontaneously-- %$* 13
at that moment, and i'll just let you know that this is the time when i really need you to do that. %$* 13
so the two times when that's the case, we'll be coming back from these breaks, and i'll raise my hand like that. %$* 13
and the other will be in a moment whether i introduce each of the debaters, when i mention their names for the first and then the second time. %$* 13
it would also be terrific if you can applaud. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
6,768.that is the number of war ships in the u.s.navy in the waning days of the second world war. %$* 13
288 ships. %$* 13
that is the number of ships in the u.s.navy in the opening days of 2013.and it's about 25 fewer than the navy says that it thinks it needs. %$* 13
215.that is what a secretary of defense warns that the navy will shrink to because of budget cuts from the so-called sequester. %$* 13
and the navy hasn't had a navy that small since 1915 when our war ships burned coal to get around. %$* 13
obviously, times change. %$* 13
military strategies change. %$* 13
budget constraints change. %$* 13
but will more cuts now compromise the common defense? %$* 13
or might we already have all of the defense we need and not just ships? %$* 13
well, it sounds like a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.in partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two. %$* 13
they will argue for and against this motion. %$* 13
our debate goes, as always, in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
and, thomas donnelly, you are a co-director of the marilyn ware center for security studies at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
you actually took part in an exercise, a kind of game, hosted, in fact, by your partner at the table, there at his think tank, where you were asked to rebalance the defense department's portfolio of weapons and capabilities on a reduced budget. %$* 13
and when you began your presentation, you said, "all i can offer you are roads to failure." so does that mean you're just a pessimist or %$* 13
i think that makes me a realist, honestly. %$* 652
we face a pretty bleak road, particularly if we continue to cut as proposed under sequestration and %$* 652
and we'll hear that from your argument. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
and, thomas, your partner tonight is-- %$* 13
my partner is andy krepinevich. %$* 652
probably much to his astonishment, a former teacher of mine, but one of the most astute defense analysts who i know. %$* 652
ladies and gentlemen, andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
andrew, you are also arguing for the motion, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." you are the president for the center for strategic and budgetary assessments. %$* 13
you spent 21 years in the u.s.army. %$* 13
and the journalist, tom ricks, once wrote of you, "i will read anything by andrew krepinevich, the fine strategic thinker who bears a strong resemblance to dwight eisenhower around 1939." is he talking looks or military mind? %$* 13
well, since eisenhower retired as a five-star general and i retired as a lieutenant colonel, i think he's probably going on looks. %$* 653
ladies and gentlemen, andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
our motion is, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." two debaters are arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome benjamin friedman. %$* 13
ben, you're a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the cato institute. %$* 13
you would like us to have a lighter military footprint around the world. %$* 13
and while you don't like the method necessarily, you think sequestration can be a good thing. %$* 13
does that mean you are the sequester's only friend in this town? %$* 13
no, i can't really stand up for sequestration, lonely as it is, but i think the law's okay but it's a dumb way to cut defense. %$* 654
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ben friedman. %$* 13
and, ben, your partner is-- %$* 13
my partner is kori schake, who you can't tell by looking at her but she's actually older and wiser than i am. %$* 654
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome kori schake. %$* 13
kori, you are also arguing against this motion that cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." you were director for defense strategy and requirements on the national security council under president bush. %$* 13
you were also, during the 2008 presidential campaign, a senior policy advisor to senator mccain. %$* 13
your sister, kristina, however, is communications director to first lady michelle obama. %$* 13
so if she were here-- %$* 13
i understand she's traveling, but if she were here would you automatically get her vote or would you automatically not get her vote? %$* 13
i'd unquestionably get her vote even if i had their side of the argument. %$* 655
ladies and gentlemen, kori schake. %$* 13
so this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a verbal joust, an intellectual competition in which you, our live audience, listens to the arguments and then picks the winners. %$* 13
and the way we have you do that is by registering your vote before and again after the debate. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have voted twice, once before and once after, and the team that has moved the most of you in terms of percentage points will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's go on to the preliminary vote now, the first vote. %$* 13
and if you go to the keypads at your seat, the motion is, "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." if you agree with this, push number one on your keypad. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, which is a perfectly reasonable position to hold, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong key, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and again, at the end of the debate, after you've heard three rounds, we'll have you vote again. %$* 13
the team who has moved the most, in terms of percentage points, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so onto round 1. the-- %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” and up to speak first for the motion, andrew krepinevich, president of the center for strategic and budgetary assessment. %$* 13
he has served in the department of defense's office of net assessment and on the personal staff of three secretaries of defense. %$* 13
he gets six minutes. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 653
and behalf of my partner, tom donnelly, i'd also like to thank intelligence squared u.s.and the mccain institute for sponsoring this debate. %$* 653
and also compliment our worthy adversaries, without whom we could not have a debate here tonight. %$* 653
tom and i, in terms of this proposition, believe that further cuts in our defenses will encourage our adversaries, and at the same time, increase the risks to our security, our economic well-being, and the security and economic well-being of our allies and partners around the world. %$* 653
in terms of the overall perspective-- %$* 653
but let's take a look at the big view. %$* 653
at the end of the cold war, 20 years ago, we were spending, on average, 6 percent of our gdp every year on our defenses. %$* 653
six percent. %$* 653
okay? %$* 653
in the span of 20 years, this year, we're down to three percent of our gdp being spent on defense. %$* 653
so we have cut in half the amount of our national wealth that we have devoted to our defenses, okay? %$* 653
i don't think you can find another major part of the federal budget where you have this kind of cut. %$* 653
so, that's point number one. %$* 653
point number two is if you look at the defense budget, you see several, i think, important things. %$* 653
one is 30 days ago this year, we decided-- %$* 653
we made a social choice, to adopt a volunteer military. %$* 653
and we never really fully paid the price of that choice until after 9/11, when we engaged in a protracted conflict in afghanistan and then in iraq. %$* 653
in order to recruit and retain sufficient members of-- %$* 653
service members to conduct those operations, we've had to increase personnel spending by over 50 percent, after inflation, since 9/11.so that's a dramatic increase. %$* 653
on top of that, the obama administration has set forth a revised defense plan which looks to cut nearly half a trillion dollars out of our defenses over the next 10 years. %$* 653
so what do you get? %$* 653
you get a shrinking defense pie, number one. %$* 653
number two, within that shrinking pie, you get an expanded slice for personnel costs. %$* 653
what does that mean? %$* 653
that means in the coming years, we're going to see a lot less funding for training, a lot less funding for maintaining our equipment, and a lot less money for replacing all the worn out equipment. %$* 653
i've been to this movie before. %$* 653
this is the equation for a hollow military. %$* 653
this is the equation for a military that gradually loses its effectiveness and capability. %$* 653
now, how will our enemies react to this? %$* 653
is this a gift to them? %$* 653
i don't know. %$* 653
i'm not-- %$* 653
i'm not privy to their thoughts. %$* 653
what i can tell you is that the silence is deafening. %$* 653
and as napoleon once said, “when your enemy is in the middle of making a great mistake, don't interrupt them.” and again-- %$* 653
so you have this particular situation. %$* 653
now, some people say, “well, gee. %$* 653
we're pulling out of afghanistan. %$* 653
we're out of iraq. %$* 653
let's reduce defense spending. %$* 653
after all, the threat is diminishing. %$* 653
well, first of all, our operations in those conflicts were funded by something called ocob, the overseas contingency operation budget. %$* 653
and those budgets are coming down and will go down to zero. %$* 653
but the base defense budget-- %$* 653
- typically, when you draw down that budget, that is when the threat is declining. %$* 653
and as robert rosenkranz mentioned, we're in a situation right now where the threat is not declining. %$* 653
he had a pretty good short list, but there's a longer list we can go through. %$* 653
john mentioned that we brought together four think tanks, from the moderate liberal to the moderate conservative, a few weeks ago to look at the sequestration cuts. %$* 653
and these are cuts-- %$* 653
let's-- %$* 653
hey, let's cut another half trillion dollars out of defense over the next decade. %$* 653
despite the fact that there's a fair part of the political spectrum that was covered, there are two conclusions that the four think tanks agreed upon: the first is that cuts of the magnitude that are discussed and put forth in sequestration will be a disaster in terms of our military readiness and capability. %$* 653
second, there is a belief-- %$* 653
again all four think tanks-- %$* 653
belief that the dangers to our security, the dangers to our economic well-being are increasing over time. %$* 653
we've cut our budget since the end of world war ii in the past, it's been when the threat's been declining, not when the threat's been increasing. %$* 653
so to sum up, those who advocate further cuts to our defenses as a way to put the fear of god into our enemies, kind of remind me of what the duke of wellington once said about his own troops. %$* 653
he said, "i don't know if they scare the enemies, but by god, these people scare the hell out of me." thank you. %$* 653
thank you. %$* 13
andrew krepinevich. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” and here to speak against the motion, benjamin friedman. %$* 13
he is a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the cato institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ben friedman. %$* 13
andrew, it's a great honor to be able to frighten you. %$* 654
that's one of my more impressive achievements. %$* 654
i think if we cut the pentagon budget to zero, sure, that would be a gift. %$* 654
but the cuts that are on offer in our political system are a different story. %$* 654
the president right now wants to spend roughly $550 billion on defense, including-- %$* 654
that's national defense, budget function 050.that doesn't include the wars. %$* 654
under sequestration, under the cap that we have in place for this coming fiscal year, that'd have to come down about 50 billion. %$* 654
and over the decade, we'd spend 4.8 trillion on defense instead of 5.3 trillion. %$* 654
we'd still account for over 40 percent of global military spending and spend more than we did at most points during the cold war in real terms. %$* 654
gdp measures-- %$* 654
the percentage of gdp measures what percentage of wealth we're spending. %$* 654
but, of course, our economy's been growing that whole time. %$* 654
we spend-- %$* 654
we're seven times wealthier than we were in 1950 or something like that. %$* 654
so if that amount of spending is a gift to our enemies, it's sort of a crappy first night of hanukkah type gift, like sweat socks or toothpaste. %$* 654
i think our enemies are too far behind for it to matter much. %$* 654
they're sort of small potatoes, historically speaking, especially when you consider our wealth, our technological prowess, and our geographic advantage; these oceans around us and our weak and peaceful neighbors. %$* 654
our biggest threat right now, according to pretty much everyone, is a scattered and increasingly pathetic remnant of the al-qaeda terrorist movement that’s failed to do much since 2001 except scare us into terrorizing ourselves. %$* 654
and even if you don't buy that take, you ought to recognize that aggressive counterterrorism operations with drones, with special operations forces, intelligence galore requires only a tiny fraction of our military budget. %$* 654
and our state enemies, north korea, iran, syria, they're brutal regimes that pose little threat here. %$* 654
they lack the capacity to conquer their neighbors, let alone come over here and harm us. %$* 654
russia, if you want to consider that an enemy, of course, has a lot of nuclear weapons, but with a dwindling population, a rusty conventional military dependent on an economy that's about equal to the iberian peninsula's, its days of threatening western europe are long gone, whatever we do. %$* 654
now, china is a bigger issue. %$* 654
i'm sure it will come up a bunch here. %$* 654
but they spend about a third of what we do on defense, on the military. %$* 654
and most of that goes to ground forces that are largely irrelevant to a naval and air war that we might have with them if we had any war. %$* 654
we have 11 carriers. %$* 654
they have one that they practice on. %$* 654
their much heralded anti-ship, ballistic missile capability which is supposed to be a threat to our ships, at the moment remains quite vulnerable to various countermeasures that we have. %$* 654
and i think maintaining that edge is not a problem of absolute resources. %$* 654
more important, china's a trading partner, not a real enemy, that we have no good reason to threaten –unless we’re eager to fight a war over disputed pacific rocks which we're not. %$* 654
i think we should hedge against china's rise not by surrounding it with our forces, which likely encourages its military buildup, but by staying rich and avoiding debt and keeping a technological edge to allow a buildup later if need be. %$* 654
i think the real question, when it comes to military spending is what's best not for our enemies, or worse for our enemies, but what's best for us. %$* 654
and i think what we want is the cheapest possible military that can defend our shores, that can keep trade routes open in times of duress. %$* 654
and fulfill the balancing function, that long guided british and then u.s.military policy for a long time. %$* 654
it is to prevent a big rival from emerging overseas that can conquer our friends and threaten us. %$* 654
and i think we can do that quite easily with very little overseas military presence right now. %$* 654
what the other side wants from our military is global dominance, which i think is not really possible. %$* 654
they'll say that current or greater spending is necessary to our military strategy which is primacy, which is to be a sort of globe girdling policeman. %$* 654
and that strategy is necessary to global stability. %$* 654
and i think both parts of that statement are wrong. %$* 654
first, we could do essentially what we do in the world now in terms of our alliances, naval patrols, bases, at a substantially cheaper cost. %$* 654
i think you could trim at least 50 billion off the defense budget and do all the stuff we do now. %$* 654
i can't explain the details of how you get there, but a good place to start, if you're interested, is dr. %$* 654
krepinevich's foreign affairs article from i think it was february this year that says we'll shift a bunch of money out of the army into the navy. %$* 654
i think that's a good idea. %$* 654
i think you could also look at the joint letter that those-- %$* 654
a number of think tanks signed on to that had a bunch of efficiency savings, including another round and personnel cost reform. %$* 654
we're not destined to spend what we do right now on personnel. %$* 654
and both my opponents signed that letter. %$* 654
second, global peace and trade i think would be fine if we adopted a more of a restrained strategy, and we'd be safer for it by staying out of avoidable trouble. %$* 654
you know, the-- %$* 654
this argument sort of reinterprets the cold war. %$* 654
we didn’t get into the cold war to make global stability or secure international system. %$* 654
we were defending europe against communism. %$* 654
we were defending some of our asian allies against communism. %$* 654
and then our allies got rich. %$* 654
and we invented a new rationale for what we're doing. %$* 654
and so the new story is we agree to defend them, and they agree to let us. %$* 654
but i think our allies now have the capacity to defend themselves, and we ought to let them do that. %$* 654
and i think what we'll see that happens is a stable balance of power in asia. %$* 654
and in europe, there's basically no threats, so that's not a problem. %$* 654
but we'll see a stable balance of power. %$* 654
and as for trade, trade routes, we don't really defend them now. %$* 654
there's very little military protection of them. %$* 654
yep. %$* 654
i'll finish right up. %$* 654
okay. %$* 654
all right. %$* 654
ben friedman, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
yep. %$* 654
i'll finish right up. %$* 654
no, no, i'm sorry. %$* 13
that's the rule. %$* 13
i got to-- %$* 13
you can bring it up in the middle of the debate. %$* 13
okay. %$* 654
all right. %$* 654
thanks very much. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ben friedman. %$* 13
and here's a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
you have heard two of the opening statement and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating in support of the motion that cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies, thomas donnelly. %$* 13
he is co-director of the marilyn ware center for security studies and resident fellow at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, tom donnelly. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 652
i'd like to echo the thanks that my colleagues gave to the iq people and the mccain institute people. %$* 652
i'd like to thank the audience too. %$* 652
it's a beautiful day and coming in here and talking about defense budgets is perhaps not the way i would spend my afternoon if i had a choice. %$* 652
the smartest soldier of all time said that everything in war is simple, but the simple things are difficult. %$* 652
and this debate is a perfect example of why that's true. %$* 652
we're really talking about three things and how they relate to one another. %$* 652
we talk about money and budgets. %$* 652
and you've already heard a fog of numbers being thrown out and slices of pies being alluded to. %$* 652
it's a lot of money that we're talking about. %$* 652
but i would ask you to consider defense spending in a different way, as not just a cost proposition but a value proposition. %$* 652
are we getting a return on our investment that's worth it as taxpayers and americans? %$* 652
i would say absolutely. %$* 652
andy says for 3 cents out of our dollar, whether we're getting the global dominance that ben suggested or merely treading water, we have a remarkably peaceful world. %$* 652
there hasn't been a great power war since the end of world war ii.and personally, i would like to keep it that way. %$* 652
that's something that i can't quite put a price tag on. %$* 652
and what we're spending now is certainly affordable. %$* 652
so ask yourselves, is it worth the money we spend? %$* 652
that's the way i would ask you guys to consider the proposition. %$* 652
second part is even more unpleasant, the idea that we have enemies in the world. %$* 652
we don't like to think that as americans. %$* 652
you know, we wish everybody loved us and we try to love them, but it is a dangerous world. %$* 652
ben sort of downplayed all the threats that are out there. %$* 652
we're going to have a discussion about that. %$* 652
reasonable people can differ over who's the biggest threat and what the size of the danger is, but, again, do you want to take a risk with this? %$* 652
if we're much stronger than our enemies, is that a bad thing? %$* 652
they're not all enemies. %$* 652
there're people who are sitting on the fence one way or the other. %$* 652
i would prefer to live in a world where we have fewer enemies and the ones that might be enemies don't want to mess with us. %$* 652
and, again, i think that's a great value proposition. %$* 652
the final part of the proposition is whether it's a gift to our enemies or not. %$* 652
as andy said, "we don't know whether it's a gift, but it is already, we can tell, a dangerous temptation," as we see in the middle east today. %$* 652
as we have come home from iraq and we're about to depart from afghanistan, we see in syria a war that's metastasizing, it's like the iraq civil war that we saw in 2006, only on steroids, much more so. %$* 652
so is that a gift to our enemies? %$* 652
i don't know. %$* 652
it's not a gift. %$* 652
going to war is never a gift. %$* 652
our withdrawal from the world after world war i was not a gift to germany and japan but it was a dangerous temptation to adolf hitler and to the imperial japanese. %$* 652
world war ii was a gift to nobody but it was a necessary thing to do and a temptation to evil people in the world, and there are evil people in the world. %$* 652
so we’ll work through all these questions. %$* 652
i like it that we have allies. %$* 652
they provide the battlefield. %$* 652
that-- %$* 652
you can't put a price tag on that. %$* 652
it's better to fight over there than it is here at home. %$* 652
so having america be powerful as well as be engaged in the world out there in the world has created a world that's more prosperous, that's safer, and for americans possibly the most important point is freer than it has ever been in human history. %$* 652
we should not give that up. %$* 652
you don't win prizes in war for being the guy who does it in the cheapest way. %$* 652
there are no style points. %$* 652
the outcome is what matters, and that's what we should be focusing on when we weigh this proposition. %$* 652
is it a gift to our enemies? %$* 652
no. %$* 652
that is a temptation to them, it's a risk for our friends, and it could be a real danger to us. %$* 652
we send very few americans-- %$* 652
we have-- %$* 652
the world is so peaceful, and our military is so good that it only takes less than 1 percent of us to maintain the peace. %$* 652
i think that's worth a priceless investment, almost. %$* 652
vote for us. %$* 652
thank you, tom donnelly. %$* 13
our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies,” and our final debater who will speak against the motion is kori schake. %$* 13
she is a research fellow at the hoover institution. %$* 13
she was a senior foreign policy advisor to the mccain-palin campaign and has served in the state department and on the national security council. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kori schake. %$* 13
so i agree with everything tom donnelly just said, and i think you can still agree with ben and me that cutting defense spending is not a gift to our enemies without compromising anything tom just said. %$* 655
and let me try and walk you through why i think that's so. %$* 655
first, as most of you probably know, 31 cents of every dollar the united states government spends, it borrows. %$* 655
we may only spend 3 percent of it on defense, but 31 percent of it, we have to borrow. %$* 655
our national debt, the extent to which our spending is outpacing our revenue, that's the gift to america's enemies. %$* 655
we actually really need to bring our spending into alignment with our revenue, and the defense budget has doubled since 2001.the sequestration, the means by which we are further reducing it is damaging, but the reduction in the top line, the overall level of spending is manageable while maintaining a strong national defense, while retaining allies, while retaining the value proposition, and while frightening our enemies. %$* 655
the united states constitutes-- %$* 655
our own defense budget is 40 percent of global defense spending. %$* 655
40 percent, all by itself. %$* 655
there are 21 aircraft carriers in the fleets of the world's navies. %$* 655
eleven of those are in our navy. %$* 655
american dominance in the military realm is overwhelming. %$* 655
of all the places you could cut spending-- %$* 655
in fact, the margin for error in national defense is enormous. %$* 655
as tom said, the value proposition that the american military provides: we can do things that other militaries cannot do and that drives our enemies to radical, asymmetric strategies. %$* 655
it drives them to terrorism. %$* 655
it drives them to cyber warfare. %$* 655
it drives them to things-- %$* 655
because they know they couldn't actually fight the american army and defeat it. %$* 655
it drives them to strategies of trying to erode our national will to fight the war, because if we fight it, we're going to win it. %$* 655
in regard to the threat from china: china is rising. %$* 655
and we're smart to hedge against a rising china. %$* 655
but i would encourage you to remember that one of the most important strategic variables, one of the most important advantages you can have, is time. %$* 655
and we actually have a lot of time to figure out how to deal with a rising china. %$* 655
and our-- %$* 655
the american military is one of many means for managing that rise and one in which we have a strong advantage. %$* 655
a second thing i'd like to ask you to consider is-- %$* 655
i agree with tom about the value proposition. %$* 655
the american military is extraordinarily good at what it does. %$* 655
that does not mean that the money that we spend on our defense we spend well. %$* 655
right? %$* 655
the defense department, in truth, actually doesn't know if we have enough money to spend on american defense, because they actually cannot pass an audit that every american business has to pass. %$* 655
they already told congress they won't be able to pass an audit until 2017.given that the budget has doubled in the last 10 years, and dod cannot account for the money, that suggests to me that there are reasonable places in the budget from which we could wring greater effectiveness in our spending. %$* 655
the american military is terrific at the effectiveness of war-fighting. %$* 655
we're not cost effective. %$* 655
we're not particularly efficient at how we do it. %$* 655
and i would offer you the testimony of general dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who said that if we forced ourselves to think, we could probably do this with less resources. %$* 655
he also said that because budgets have essentially been unconstrained for the last 10 years, the american military has gotten into a lot of bad habits. %$* 655
as admiral mullen, general dempsey's predecessor, said, we have raised a generation of military leaders who don't know how to budget because they've never had to do it. %$* 655
let me just point out to you some of the cost-drivers or how expensive american defense is. %$* 655
gao determined the last year that we wasted $74 billion in the year 2012 because of the procurement process, because of what senator mccain has described as the political-- %$* 655
as the military industrial congressional complex. %$* 655
the pentagon's determined we have 20 percent more bases and facilities than we need and congress will not permit them to close them. %$* 655
the military-- %$* 655
the pentagon has tried to ramp down the expansion of the personnel account-- %$* 655
military raises, housing, funding, pensions-- %$* 655
and congress won't do it. %$* 655
so even the pentagon understands the resources to be saved here. %$* 655
in fact, the position that we are in is that we have the world's finest military and that all-volunteer force is becoming unaffordable. %$* 655
we have to better constrain the costs of our defense. %$* 655
and even within national security, there are things that need money even more than the american military, right? %$* 655
if you look at why were are not more decisively winning the wars in iraq and afghanistan, the wars we have fought in the last 10 years, the reason is we're underfunding diplomacy, development, other things we need to spend our money on. %$* 655
thank you, kori. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, in partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership, where our motion is, “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing over this motion. %$* 13
and now, we move on to round 2.two teams of two arguing this motion: cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, andrew krepinevich and tom donnelly have argued that budget cuts threatened-- %$* 13
threaten to make a dangerous world even more dangerous, that a weaker u.s.military would encourage our adversaries and create for us a hollow military. %$* 13
they say that the peace and security that comes in 3 cents of the dollar is a bargain considering what a peaceful world it has led to for so long in terms of wars among the great powers; that this is a dangerous world, and we have to take our enemies seriously, in their perception of this, as a weakness on our part. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, kori schake and ben friedman, say that the threat at this point is exaggerated. %$* 13
number one, we are so dominant militarily, we have oceans protecting us, a technological advantage, and a dominance that makes it just too early to worry about a real threat to our existence. %$* 13
they say that the-- %$* 13
that their opponents are actually arguing for a global domination that is unnecessary to ensure the common defense. %$* 13
and they also point out that the cost of the military itself actually represents the real threat to our national security. %$* 13
i want to ask the team that's arguing for this motion, the team that is arguing that the cuts are a threat to our security and a gift to our enemies, to put to you a point that your opponent, ben friedman, has made, that your argument for a strong military-- %$* 13
military does not have to suffer these budget cuts is premised on a goal of global domination. %$* 13
he says that's really what your vision is. %$* 13
is that accurate? %$* 13
do you cop to that, tom donnelly? %$* 13
well, i like to do the crime before i do the time. %$* 652
so no. %$* 652
you know, dominance is a loaded term, no question. %$* 652
that's why i used it. %$* 13
yeah, no. %$* 652
i noted that. %$* 652
but i'll cop to it. %$* 652
you know, it doesn't bother me if america is stronger than everybody else times two or three. %$* 652
america's role in the world, from my perspective, has been pretty positive. %$* 652
and the use of american military power has made a better world, and so i'd rather be dominant than weak. %$* 652
andrew, let me come back to you because i'd like to just hear from the other side on that. %$* 13
ben, it was your point. %$* 13
can you respond to tom-- %$* 13
well, that's a false dichotomy. %$* 654
my whole point is that we're incredibly strong now, vis- a-vis our enemies. %$* 654
so weakness is not something that's on the table in this debate. %$* 654
the argument is they say we need to try to have ten times the power of our enemies and basically guide history to be safe. %$* 654
and that's a massive overdefinition of our safety. %$* 654
the united states is incredibly safe from natural geographic reasons because of our economy. %$* 654
and most of what we're doing in the name of safety or defense is sort of a luxury that most states don't endeavor to do. %$* 654
and i think it gets us into trouble that we could avoid. %$* 654
you know, a few difference of percentage points in the defense budget is not going to make a difference. %$* 654
but if we really rethought our strategy, we could be a lot safer because we'd avoid conflicts that we get into. %$* 654
all right. %$* 13
we’ll get onto that in a bit. %$* 13
i want to let andrew krepinevich respond. %$* 13
ben was kind enough to cite my foreign affairs article. %$* 653
in the article, even absent the sequestration cuts, i said we're going to have to really trim our sails. %$* 653
we're not going to be able to fight or deal with threats in two different regions, even though there are three regions in the world we consider to be vital interests. %$* 653
we're not-- %$* 653
maybe-- %$* 653
i think this is a good thing. %$* 653
we're not going to be able to threaten anybody with regime change. %$* 653
i think we're going to struggle just to maintain access to critical regions where we have trading partners and resource requirements. %$* 653
we haven't figured out a way to deter cyber attacks. %$* 653
and the cyber threat is growing. %$* 653
we haven't figured out a way to protect our assets in space. %$* 653
and i think the next big thing coming down the road is the undersea infrastructure which is huge. %$* 653
and with the spread of robotics, increasingly accessible even to non-state groups who can threaten the enormous energy infrastructure that in military parlance is comprised mostly of soft targets. %$* 653
let me bring that to kori schake. %$* 13
the money argument, that just sounds like everything that was just outlined is important and will cost a lot. %$* 13
kori schake. %$* 13
well, you know don’t have to do things in the future the way we have done them in the past. %$* 655
and i think one of the important advantages of the american military is actually its adaptability, and its innovation. %$* 655
our biggest advantage isn't our spending; it's the creativity and build a better mouse trap. %$* 655
but are you saying that-- %$* 13
is your point really that the u.s. military could do a lot more with a lot less, a lot more? %$* 13
i think both sides agree, and i don't think there's much debate to kori's point that there's waste, and there could be more efficiency. %$* 13
i think they agree with that. %$* 13
we can do it differently. %$* 655
we can drive innovation so that our enemies' advantages get matched up better against. %$* 655
one of the challenges that we have in the current defense budget is that the force structure doesn't match the strategy as both our colleagues across the aisle have-- %$* 655
yeah. %$* 654
we can make more choices. %$* 654
i think at least one of our opponents would agree that if we cut the ground forces a lot we could afford to do lots of things with the navy, with a smaller budget than we have now. %$* 654
the problem-- %$* 653
andrew krepinevich, go ahead. %$* 13
the problem is right now that, you know, efficiency is everybody's favorite solution, you know. %$* 653
we have efficiencies, magic happens, and then all of a sudden we save all this money. %$* 653
we’ve been going to that movie for about 50 years now, and the result is always the same. %$* 653
we put the cart before the horse. %$* 653
you know, let congress and the political leadership take on the responsibility, exercise the moral courage to make these changes before we saddle our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines with the problem. %$* 653
i was talking to one-- %$* 653
in fact secretary panetta-- %$* 653
and if you don’t already know, he's very fond of colorful language. %$* 653
and i raised the issue of efficiencies. %$* 653
and he said, “that's a bunch of bologna,” although he didn't use the word "bologna." %$* 653
this is a radio show, so i'm glad you censored. %$* 13
and, you know, for those who say, “well, we spend more than others,” well, as i mentioned earlier, we have a volunteer military. %$* 653
what kind of military do you think we'd have if we paid our soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines what the pakistanis pay theirs or what the russians pay theirs or what the chinese pay theirs? %$* 653
as tom said, do you want to wait until the enemy is at your shores and then start figuring out how to deal with the threat? %$* 653
all right, let me-- %$* 13
let me put that very question to the other side: do you want to wait until the enemies are at your shores and-- %$* 13
we have a lot of straw men coming out now. %$* 654
you know, fight him over here, fight him-- %$* 654
i'm saying, don't fight him. %$* 654
let's have fewer wars. %$* 654
but, i mean, i think you guys both just signed a letter saying we should reform compensation for personnel. %$* 654
so we're not going to pay them like pakistan or russia. %$* 654
we're going to pay them well. %$* 654
we're going to pay them what they would get in a regular market, i think, with those reforms. %$* 654
and i'm for that too. %$* 654

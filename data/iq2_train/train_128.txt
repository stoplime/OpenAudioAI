so that's the shape of it. %$* 13
we hope you'll enjoy this, and we're delighted that you're all here. %$* 13
and we are delighted to be here. %$* 13
and to that end, i want to bring to the stage two gentlemen. %$* 13
i will introduce them first, and then i'll tell you why they're here. %$* 13
but first i'd like to bring to the stage nicholas quinn rosenkranz. %$* 13
he is a professor of law at georgetown. %$* 13
and he is a director of the rosenkranz foundation which is what initiated the intelligence squared debates series here in the united states back in 2006.please let's welcome to the stage nick rosenkranz. %$* 13
oh, you walked up-- %$* 13
he jumped his cue on me. %$* 13
and jeffrey rosen. %$* 13
jeffrey is the president and chief executive officer of the national constitution center. %$* 13
and he is also professor at the george washington university law school. %$* 13
i think you know him well. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeffrey rosen. %$* 13
and what we want to do is chat very briefly about how this debate came about. %$* 13
both of these gentlemen had a part in the fact that iq2, as we call it, iq2us, normally based in new york, but we come to various cities. %$* 13
our first time in philadelphia. %$* 13
jeffrey, how did this happen? %$* 13
well, first of all, let me say how thrilled i am by this collaboration between iq2 and the national constitution center. %$* 49
i have been the head of this wonderful organization since june. %$* 49
and the national constitution center is the only institution in the country chartered by congress to disseminate information about the u.s.constitution on a nonpartisan basis. %$* 49
so our current board chair is governor jeb bush. %$* 49
previous chairs have been president clinton and h.w.bush ’41.and on basically my first day on the job, i went to governor bush and said, "i want to be the place in the country where all sides of constitutional debates come, and people can make up their own minds.” i said, "we're not going to talk about politics, just about constitutional issues, and bring together folks who never talk to one another.” and governor bush said, "you know, you've got to talk to iq2 because they are the best policy debate organization in the entire country.” so i called up bob rosenkranz, the head of iq2, and he said, "you've got to talk to my son nick.” and i said, "i've heard all about nick. %$* 49
he teaches constitutional law over at georgetown, and i'm at gw, and i've been eager to meet him.” so i called up nick, and i said, "why don't we start up a constitutional debate series? %$* 49
" and he immediately said, "yes. %$* 49
what a great idea. %$* 49
we're only going to debate the constitution. %$* 49
we're not going to debate politics. %$* 49
and we are going to do this better than anyone else in the country.” here we are. %$* 49
i am so thrilled to welcome you to the national constitution center. %$* 49
we're thrilled to be here. %$* 67
can you corroborate all of that? %$* 13
i corroborate all of that. %$* 67
that's what happened. %$* 67
so, nick, in fact, we actually did do a debate several months back in our last season on the issue of the practical, political side of what was then called drone— we were calling "drone warfare.” the motion was: the president's drone warfare policy is fatally flawed. %$* 13
and yet now we're, in a sense, revisiting this issue again, but we're doing it in a different cut, with this constitutional issue. %$* 13
why are we doing it that way? %$* 13
yes. %$* 67
that's a great question. %$* 67
i know you flagged this a bit before we came out to the stage. %$* 67
but so this is the constitutional question. %$* 67
and it is distinct, potentially, from the policy question. %$* 67
so, for example, it is completely coherent for you to believe that these targeted killings are a great idea and yet unconstitutional. %$* 67
it's also completely coherent for you to believe that they're a horrible idea and yet constitutional. %$* 67
those things are fine to believe. %$* 67
we are talking today only about the constitutional question. %$* 67
and to that end, what would be some terms of art that would be useful for us to know as the law professors here that would be relevant to today's debate? %$* 13
well, so most important probably is what clause of the constitution is going to turn out to be at issue. %$* 67
i would predict we'll end up talking mostly about the due process clause. %$* 67
so "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” i think we have it up on the screen there. %$* 67
and you can expect one side to say, look, the text is clear. %$* 67
you cannot do this. %$* 67
on the other hand though, you might say, well, wait a second, that doesn't apply in a war zone or it doesn't apply to someone who's taken up arms against the united states. %$* 67
you know, or i suppose you could say, yes, it does apply, but this isn't a process. %$* 67
this is the amount of process that's due. %$* 67
and so, i think you might hear something along those lines. %$* 67
all right. %$* 13
that gives everybody a jump start on their thinking about this. %$* 13
and jeffrey and nick, i want to thank you again for bringing us here. %$* 13
and let's bring our terrific debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, jeffrey-- %$* 13
both. %$* 13
great. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
have a great debate. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
and as i mentioned, as this is a radio broadcast, there will be times during the evening when you'll hear me repeating certain things over and over again. %$* 13
i will tell you again and again what my name is. %$* 13
and it's not because i forget. %$* 13
it's for coming back from breaks in the radio broadcast. %$* 13
and also, for the same purpose. %$* 13
there are various times when i might ask you to applaud spontaneously. %$* 13
but the signal for that spontaneous applause would be-- %$* 13
would be this. %$* 13
and we might actually get started with that right now. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, thank you. %$* 13
a police officer is chasing a bad guy, and he's got him cornered. %$* 13
and the cop has a gun out, pointing at him. %$* 13
and does he get to shoot the bad guy at that point and decide his fate right then and there? %$* 13
well, no. %$* 13
unless the bad guy happens to pose an imminent danger, as in he pulls out a gun and tries to shoot the cop. %$* 13
but otherwise, the bad guy-- %$* 13
the suspect— actually gets a trip downtown. %$* 13
and he gets his day in court, which is his right. %$* 13
but what if the bad guy is a suspected american terrorist living overseas who is believed, in the last few months to have planned attacks on the united states, and the president is told by his aides, "we know where this guy is right now, we can get him today," does the president get to kill that guy, decide his fate right then and there, or does that american have rights, too? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the national constitution center in philadelphia. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who are divided on this issue, two against two, with the motion being "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.” as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion again, "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.” let's meet the team arguing for the motion first. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome alan dershowitz. %$* 13
and, alan, you are the felix frankfurter professor of law at harvard. %$* 13
you're well known for your civil liberties advocacy. %$* 13
you've served as legal advisor to julian assange. %$* 13
you have argued to save two brothers from the death penalty in front of the supreme court. %$* 13
you defended the right of neo-nazis to march through skokie, illinois. %$* 13
you recently retired, but you have described it as more of a career change, so what are you doing with all your free time? %$* 13
free time, i wish. %$* 305
i am busier than ever—writing, litigating, debating, and occasionally taking walks on the beach in florida. %$* 305
well, we're glad we have you here during this free time of yours. %$* 13
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
and, alan, tell us who your partner is in this debate. %$* 13
my partner is a real american hero. %$* 305
he served in the military. %$* 305
and now he does a great job in defending the military, the distinguished professor, michael lewis. %$* 305
ladies and gentlemen, michael lewis. %$* 13
and, michael, you also are arguing for the motion that "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.”and, as alan dershowitz mentioned, you're a professor of law at ohio northern university pettit college of law and you served in the navy. %$* 13
you flew f-14s, and you flew those in missions including operation desert shield and desert storm. %$* 13
so your having this combined law experience and this combined combat experience combines in what way for you? %$* 13
well, it gives me a perspective that most people that write in this area don't have. %$* 379
most lawyers are military lawyers first. %$* 379
i was a combatant before i knew the law. %$* 379
i first encountered the law when i was learning roe in the gulf war. %$* 379
so that means you know what you're talking about. %$* 13
i hope so. %$* 379
well, we'll find out. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and we have two debaters arguing against this motion that "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.” let's meet the first of them. %$* 13
please welcome noah feldman. %$* 13
noah, you are the bemis professor of international law at harvard law school. %$* 13
you were an advisor in the drafting of iraq's constitution, and in-- %$* 13
which meant you were over there. %$* 13
yes, you see how well that went. %$* 380
well, you try. %$* 13
you try. %$* 13
and you are also a very prolific author including in 2013 coauthoring the casebook constitutional law, 18th edition? %$* 13
so were you there at edition one? %$* 13
not exactly. %$* 380
that was how far back? %$* 13
that was in 1937. %$* 380
all right, so you may have been precocious but not that precocious. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, noah feldman. %$* 13
and, noah, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is also a genuine american hero, the inspiring and remarkable hina shamsi of the aclu. %$* 380
ladies and gentlemen, hina shamsi. %$* 13
also arguing against the motion that "the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.”you are the director of the aclu's national security project. %$* 13
you have directed human rights first’s law & security program. %$* 13
and right now, hina, you are in the middle of litigating a lawsuit actually directly related to the subject before us tonight. %$* 13
tell us briefly what's going on in that. %$* 13
i represent the families of three u.s.citizens who were killed as part of president obama's targeted killing program in yemen in 2011.these family members want to know why their sons and grandson died, and one of the people who died is on anwar al- awlaki, who's referred to in your program. %$* 381
one of the other people who died was his 16-year-old son whom no one has accused of wrongdoing but who was blown up by a drone while he was eating dinner at an outdoor restaurant. %$* 381
all of which tells us that none of this is theoretical. %$* 13
we are talking about the real world. %$* 13
let's please welcome hina shamsi. %$* 13
so, as we said before, this-- %$* 13
this is a contest. %$* 13
this is a debate. %$* 13
only one side will win, and they will win by determination of your vote-- %$* 13
our live audience here in philadelphia. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have voted twice-- %$* 13
once before the debate, and once again after you've heard the argument. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's get the preliminary vote registered. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat, take a look again at this motion: the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push #1.and if you disagree, push #2.if you're undecided, #3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong key, you can correct yourself, and the system-- %$* 13
in about 15 seconds-- %$* 13
will lock out your most recent vote. %$* 13
and remember, what we do at the end of the debate-- %$* 13
you vote a second time. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms is our winner. %$* 13
all right? %$* 13
it looks like everybody's completed that. %$* 13
so, onto round 1.round 1 are opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each. %$* 13
up first for the motion-- %$* 13
the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s. citizens abroad-- %$* 13
michael lewis, a professor of law at ohio northern university pettit college of law and former navy fighter pilot. %$* 13
michael, if you can make your way to the lectern, when you get there, i'm going to tell everybody your name one more time. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael lewis. %$* 13
thank you all for coming, and thank you to the national constitution center for hosting the debate. %$* 379
the president does have the power-- %$* 379
the constitutional power-- %$* 379
to target american citizens overseas in the exercise of his war-making power. %$* 379
now, that war- making power is not unfettered. %$* 379
the founding fathers saw to it that only congress may declare war. %$* 379
now, while formal declarations of war have not occurred since world war ii, major military operations, such as the gulf war, the 2001 afghan war, and 2003 in iraq-- %$* 379
all only happened after the executive was authorized to use military force by large bipartisan majorities of both houses of congress. %$* 379
now, the aumf-- %$* 379
the authorization to use military force-- %$* 379
in 2001, which is the basis for president obama's continued use of his war-making power against al-qaeda and associated forces-- %$* 379
our opponents will say, was only directed at those that participated in or planned 9/11.however, since that time, the judiciary, in the line of habeas cases from guantanamo, has determined that the scope of that authority actually is al-qaeda and associated forces. %$* 379
the thinking behind this is that when you're dealing with an enemy like al-qaeda, that is diffuse, that is splintered, you are not going to require the president to return to congress for authorization every time a new group with a new name shows up in a new location-- %$* 379
as long as they are still trying to kill americans in this country or kill american troops and contractors in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 379
further, since that judicial gloss has been placed upon the scope of the authorization, congress-- %$* 379
the senate armed services committee-- %$* 379
held hearings last year on whether the aumf should be revised, repealed, or retained. %$* 379
and at the conclusion of those hearings, they left it as it was and so, at least implicitly, have accepted the scope of the authorization that the judiciary has put on this. %$* 379
now, once the executive has received the authorization to use military force from congress, it is then the exclusive province of the executive branch to determine when, where, and how that war is fought. %$* 379
congress tells him who we are declaring war on. %$* 379
we declare a war on germany, he can't go fight france. %$* 379
but it is up to him how he fights germany, where he fights germany, who he targets. %$* 379
that is exclusive executive decision-making. %$* 379
and no other branch has any constitutional basis for challenging that decision-making. %$* 379
and this is true, even when we are talking about targeting americans. %$* 379
during world war ii, the united states armed forces killed a number of american citizens that were members of the german and japanese armies. %$* 379
but in today's war, we are being told that although those people-- %$* 379
the germans and japanese that we killed without questioning whether we were invading or infringing upon their due process rights. %$* 379
we're told that today, because our enemy doesn't wear uniforms, doesn't carry arms openly, hides amongst the civilian population and uses human shields, in other words, because they undermine all of the basic tenets of the laws of war, that they should be afforded due process rights that an american putting on a german uniform does not have. %$* 379
now, the president does have a duty, under international law, to distinguish between targetable individuals and civilians. %$* 379
but he does not have a duty under either international law or the u.s.constitution to distinguish between targetable americans and targetable non-americans. %$* 379
and as my partner will argue, such a distinction would be immoral. %$* 379
now, you will hear our opponents argue that this authority of the executive is geographically bounded by “hot battlefields.” you can only use this authority in “hot battlefields.” that is a term that does not appear anywhere in either international law or in the u.s. constitution. %$* 379
and yet because internal armed conflicts have been determined to exist based upon a level of violence measure, by some commentators in some courts, they are trying to impose that view of international law on our president. %$* 379
however, the u.s.view of international law is consistent with that of many other nations that face non-state actors that have committed terrorist acts against their citizens and then tried to seek sanctuary by crossing some international boundary. %$* 379
and just as columbia and turkey and israel and even iran reject the notion that you may gain such sanctuary, the united states also agrees that the laws of armed conflict go where the participants in the armed conflict go. %$* 379
and because this is an armed conflict, there are no due process rights available. %$* 379
lastly, we are going to hear from our opponents that there is insufficient transparency on the part of the administration. %$* 379
they are not telling us enough about how they know what they know about our enemies and what they know about our enemies and why they are targeting our enemies. %$* 379
now, of course, if they reveal this to the american public, they are also revealing it to our enemies. %$* 379
and to say that the due process rights of our enemies must be vindicated by telling our enemies what we know about them and how we know it does not-- %$* 379
well, let me say that it is obvious why there is no constitutional requirement for such disclosures. %$* 379
thank you. %$* 379
thank you, michael lewis. %$* 13
our motion is “the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad.” and our next debater to speak against this motion, hina shamsi. %$* 13
she is the director of the aclu national security project. %$* 13
and she is currently litigating a lawsuit that challenges the government's killing of three u.s.citizens in yemen. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, hina shamsi. %$* 13
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 381
today the president is claiming an absolute power that would have horrified the founding fathers. %$* 381
he asserts the authority to kill american citizens without judicial review based on largely secret law, entirely secret evidence, and he asserts this power even with respect to americans who are found far from any conventional battlefield. %$* 381
noah and i are here to argue against the proposition, because the power that the president is claiming is unlawful and it is unwise. %$* 381
in our system of checks and balances, the president cannot be the judge, jury and executioner. %$* 381
now, for very good reason, our constitution and international law strictly limits the government's power to kill people without judicial review. %$* 381
in areas of actual armed conflict, under the law, the government can kill people without judicial review because of battlefield requirements. %$* 381
outside that context, extra judicial killing is legal only if it is a last resort and only if its in response to a truly imminent threat. %$* 381
the government can't kill americans simply because it believes that they may do something dangerous at some point far off in the future. %$* 381
this is a democracy. %$* 381
it's not minority report. %$* 381
so in every context, the constitution, outside of armed conflict, the constitution requires the government to prove its case to a court before it delivers a death sentence. %$* 381
that's because even the most serious allegations are not evidence. %$* 381
and due process requires evidence, not just allegations. %$* 381
now, the president, and our opposition, seek to circumvent due process in ways that strike at the heart of our system of checks and balances of what it means to be a nation ruled by law, not men or women. %$* 381
first they want to redefine the battlefield so that it covers the globe. %$* 381
that's not just wrong. %$* 381
it's a very dangerous proposition. %$* 381
and noah's going to address that more. %$* 381
then they want to redefine the law. %$* 381
we only found out after the leak of a so-called white paper which purports to summarize still-secret legal memos that were written to justify the killing of a u.s.citizen, anwar al-awlaki. %$* 381
the white paper acknowledged that he was going to be killed outside of recognized battlefields, but argued that the killing could be lawful in response to an imminent threat. %$* 381
it then redefined imminence to mean its very opposite. %$* 381
the white house now says that it can order the killing of an american it suspects may some day present a threat even without evidence of an actual plot. %$* 381
this is a radical reinterpretation of the law. %$* 381
what should trouble us as much as these legal shenanigans is that the actual full standards for killing americans far from any battlefield are still secret. %$* 381
the government refuses to disclose to us its killing memos. %$* 381
was anwar al-awlaki truly an imminent threat? %$* 381
the only way to find out would be for president obama's justice department to present its evidence to a court. %$* 381
this the government refuses to do. %$* 381
instead, the justice department has made a profoundly disturbing argument and claim. %$* 381
it said that the courts have no role to play in deciding whether al-awlaki's killing, far from a battlefield, was lawful. %$* 381
now, you may hear a lot tonight from the other side about why we need to trust the government when it comes to national security and threats. %$* 381
but one of the core lessons of the last decade is that "trust us" is never enough when the government claims power over life and liberty. %$* 381
do you remember when the bush administration claimed that the people at guantanamo were all terrorists, the worst of the worst? %$* 381
remember when president bush's justice department fought for years to prevent any judicial review of those claims ultimately without success? %$* 381
and do you remember what happened next? %$* 381
as the courts finally started reviewing the bush administration's claims, it turned out that more often than not, the evidence that the government relied on was overstated, it didn't exist, or it was just plain wrong. %$* 381
the result was that the bush administration itself released the majority of people at guantanamo. %$* 381
when a president wrongly detains people, there's always the possibility of judicial review and release. %$* 381
there is no appeal from a drone strike. %$* 381
many americans were outraged when president obama claimed worldwide authority to detain people, suspected terrorists, without charge or trial. %$* 381
we should be similarly outraged when president obama claims something far more radical: the power, worldwide, to kill people the government unilaterally deems its enemies. %$* 381
now, our concern here tonight isn't just for citizens. %$* 381
four americans have been killed in the targeted killing program. %$* 381
but thousands more non-citizens are dead. %$* 381
several hundreds of these were far from any battlefield. %$* 381
they include a grandmother, for example, who was picking vegetables in her garden. %$* 381
and there are many more horrific accounts of similar tragedies and wrongful deaths. %$* 381
it isn't surprising then that military leaders warn that president obama's lethal program is creating more enemies than it kills. %$* 381
unlawful killings will never lead to security no matter how many of them our government commits. %$* 381
think about the world we're creating. %$* 381
if the u.s. can carry out targeted killings in yemen and pakistan, why can't the russians, the chinese and iranians do the same, russia in kiev, london or washington, d.c.? %$* 381
this is not the world that we want to live in. %$* 381
and noah and i hope you agree with us and vote no to the motion. %$* 381
it's a proposition that is un-american, unlawful and unwise. %$* 381
thank you. %$* 381
thank you, hina shamsi. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
you've heard two of the opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
here to argue for the motion, ladies and gentlemen, alan dershowitz, who is the felix frankfurter professor of law at the harvard law school and author of 30 books, including his autobiography, taking the stand: my life in the law. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 305
under the precise motion before this house, our opponents have the extraordinarily heavy burden of showing that under no circumstances should the commander-in-chief ever have the authority to order the targeting of dangerous terrorists—regardless of how imminent the threat may be, how impossible it would be to capture him—if that enemy happens to have been born in the united states or naturalized as an american citizen. %$* 305
consider the implications of that extreme position. %$* 305
it would mean that if osama bin laden had been born in america, had been planning the attacks on 9/11, were targeted, it was impossible to arrest him, and the only way to stop him from carrying out 9/11 would be to subject him to a drone attack, under the negative of the resolution, the president would lack that authority. %$* 305
that just makes no sense at all. %$* 305
of course what they're going to try to do now is try to modify their extreme position by saying that the president would be authorized under certain circumstances, they've already conceded in the battlefield if it's an american, they've already conceded apparently if the judiciary agrees, so they've already undercut their proposition considerably. %$* 305
but consider the implications even of their modified position. %$* 305
it would mean that unelected judges unfamiliar with the situation on the ground and inexpert at making intelligence assessment and operational decisions could prevent the commander-in- chief from taking action designed to protect americans from terrorist attacks—even if such preventive action would be entirely lawful under both american and international law—if the people happen to have been american citizens. %$* 305
this is not minority report. %$* 305
these are cases where there is clear evidence that somebody in the past has joined al- qaeda or its affiliates, has been an operational leader of al-qaeda, and has participated in the planning of operations against the united states. %$* 305
that's not minority report. %$* 305
our opponents argue that a terrorist commander planning an imminent attack on the united states that can only be prevented by a drone attack has a constitutional due process right to a judicial predetermination. %$* 305
but consider the following relevant analogy: what if an american citizen wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with his passport on one side and the american flag on the other took a series of hostages? %$* 305
you don't even have to imagine it. %$* 305
just consider if timothy mcveigh instead of killing so many children in oklahoma city had taken them hostage, and let's assume that he had said, "i'm not going to kill anybody for 48 hours until i complete the negotiation," but during that 48-hour period a sharpshooter was able to target him, not knowing exactly when he might start killing americans. %$* 305
would anybody in their right mind demand a due process prejudicial determination, or would you say that the situation there permits for the use of deadly force? %$* 305
that's not murder. %$* 305
yes, it's an extrajudicial killing, but extrajudicial killings occur all the time. %$* 305
every time a fleeing felon runs away with a machine gun from a bank robbery, even though the bank robbery's complete, just on the basis of the possibility they may do it again, the united states supreme court has definitively ruled that deadly force may be used without violating his due process rights and without a predetermined judicial authority. %$* 305
in fact, the supreme court, just two days ago, heard a case on that issue, and the report in the new york times said none of the justices gave any attention to the claim that it would be a due process violation in shooting a fleeing felon under those situations. %$* 305
of course mistakes are made. %$* 305
there are-- %$* 305
mistakes are made with fleeing felons, and of course every effort should be made to reduce the number of casualties. %$* 305
some of the people referred to by my distinguished opponent were accidentally killed, including the son. %$* 305
he wasn't targeted. %$* 305
when you drop bombs people are accidentally killed. %$* 305
it's especially the case when terrorists make the decision to hide among civilians. %$* 305
they make the decision to violate the rules of law, the rules of warfare, and, as the result, the only option put to a democracy is to use the drone in the most targeted possible way, knowing that there might be some collateral damage and civilian casualties or allow the terrorists to continue. %$* 305
there should not be a distinction drawn between terrorists who are american citizens and terrorists who are not, except, of course, if they're captured, in which case being an american citizen makes it worse because it's treason. %$* 305
but if they're not captured, if they're on the battlefield, once one signs up to become an al-qaeda operative, his or her citizenship does not and should not matter. %$* 305
the important distinction is not between americans and non-americans, but rather between combatants and civilians. %$* 305
all al-qaeda operatives are unlawful combatants. %$* 305
that is, they are subject to being targeted as combatants, because they've joined al-qaeda, because they are at war with the united states. %$* 305
but they are not entitled to the benefits of being legitimate combatants because they do not comply with the rules of warfare. %$* 305
so, just use your common sense and ask yourself the question-- %$* 305
does the constitution really straight- jacket the commander-in-chief of the united states armed forces? %$* 305
does it really deny him the constitutional power to prevent an act of terrorism just because the person planning the act of terrorism is an american citizen? %$* 305
i urge you to vote that the president has such power to protect you and your children. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 13
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
our motion: the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
and here, our final debater making opening statements, and he is arguing against this motion-- %$* 13
noah feldman. %$* 13
he is the beamis professor of international law at harvard law school and a contributing writer for the new york times magazine and bloomberg view. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, noah feldman. %$* 13
when i was a kid, i really liked to argue. %$* 380
and my parents told me that i should grow up and i should defend civil liberties, like alan dershowitz. %$* 380
i don't think they thought-- %$* 380
and i know i didn't think-- %$* 380
that i would eventually have to defend civil liberties from alan dershowitz-- %$* 380
but that seems to be where we are. %$* 380
we're on hallowed ground here. %$* 380
those of you who live in philadelphia are accustomed to invocations of the constitution and its importance. %$* 380
but for those of us who are visitors, it's not a trivial thing to come from the airport, get out of the taxi, and see independence hall, where the most basic principles of liberty were set down for the united states. %$* 380
and indeed, the framers believed, that by demonstration, they were setting down those principles of liberty for the whole world. %$* 380
that matters, and it ought to matter to us in thinking about this issue, because it pushes us to ask what's really the most fundamental question you could ask about the nature of liberty and democratic government: what is the essence of liberty? %$* 380
what's it all for? %$* 380
why do we even have a constitution? %$* 380
and if you boil that down to its deepest essence, the most fundamental component of liberty, going back to magna carta, which is 1215-- %$* 380
if you're counting. %$* 380
not the time 12:15. the year 1215. the essence of magna carta-- %$* 380
the thing that was demanded from king john of england-- %$* 380
was to promise that the government would not kill its own citizens without a trial. %$* 380
that's it. %$* 380
that's the essence of liberty. %$* 380
your government can't kill you without a trial. %$* 380
and when we say "due process," which is a fancy expression, that's all it means. %$* 380
that means you get a chance to explain that you didn't do it, that it wasn't you. %$* 380
and before that happens, they won't kill you. %$* 380
now, if you are fighting at the battle of guadalcanal in a japanese uniform, and you suddenly hold in the air your u.s.passport, sure, there is no doubt that in that context, the american soldier on the other side can kill you, because you are on the battlefield in a legitimate war. %$* 380
and to think otherwise would be preposterous. %$* 380
and it is, to be completely blunt, a classic debaters' trick to say that somehow, we have a radical position or that we've modified our radical position for denying that. %$* 380
that's just common sense. %$* 380
and common sense should, i insist, drive your vote in this case-- %$* 380
though not exactly in the direction that our opponents think it ought to. %$* 380
now, what is the difference between a person on the battlefield fighting in a war and an american citizen, thousands of miles from home, who is targeted by a government program? %$* 380
the answer is pretty simple, and there are two of them. %$* 380
one is, under the international law of war and under our domestic law, the threat has to be imminent. %$* 380
as hina explained, imminence is-- %$* 380
means what the word imminence sounds like it means. %$* 380
imminent. %$* 380
about to happen. %$* 380
and if you read the white paper, what it says-- %$* 380
this government document-- %$* 380
it's nominally a description of an even more secret document - - it says "imminence is not imminence. %$* 380
imminence is where you might have done something in the past and you're a member of al-qaeda, and maybe you're a senior member of al-qaeda, and so you might do something in the future. %$* 380
that's not imminence under the law, and it's not imminence under common sense. %$* 380
the second element is, you have to be in the war. %$* 380
you have to be on the battlefield. %$* 380
now, the other side has said, quite honestly-- %$* 380
and i give them a lot of credit for saying this-- %$* 380
that in their opinion, the battlefield is anywhere. %$* 380
anywhere. %$* 380
so you get off the plane at heathrow, some of you probably travel every so often. %$* 380
you're abroad, so you're under the terms of our motion. %$* 380
you can be killed. %$* 380
why? %$* 380
because the president of the united states could determine, secretly, by a secret process, that he believes that you are affiliated with either al-qaeda or some other force that he says, now, 13 years after 9/11, is affiliated with al-qaeda. %$* 380
we'll leave aside whether you could be affiliated with an affiliated group, but there's reason to think that even that would satisfy the administration. %$* 380
and when that happens, you can be killed. %$* 380
now, is that consistent with the idea of a declaration of war? %$* 380
no, it is not, because a battlefield cannot stretch forever in time and everywhere in geographical dimension. %$* 380
that is not war under the meaning of our constitution. %$* 380
it is not war as our founding fathers would have recognized it. %$* 380
it is not war even as congress would have intended. %$* 380
and it is certainly not war under the meaning of international law as is shared by people around the world. %$* 380
that meaning, by the way, is relevant to our constitution, because when our constitution talks about the declaration of war, it's referring to a concept from international law. %$* 380
the word "war" means something in our constitution. %$* 380
it gets its meaning from international law. %$* 380
as a consequence of all this, you have to have ask yourselves, where will it end? %$* 380
so there's a plausible answer, which is, eventually, congress will say the war is over. %$* 380
when do you think that's going to happen? %$* 380
when do you think it's going to be in the political interests of your elected representatives to stand up and say, you know, 9/11 happened. %$* 380
we fought back. %$* 380
the war against terror is over, and we hereby-- %$* 380
what, peace treaty? %$* 380
there's not going to be a peace treaty. %$* 380
so i think it's quite realistic to expect that from the standpoint of congress, and therefore from the standpoint of the executive, they're never going to end this war. %$* 380
and the same goes for geographical range. %$* 380
they're never going to say they can't kill you. %$* 380
if that bothers you, you should vote no on the proposition. %$* 380
thank you. %$* 13
noah feldman. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where the motion is: the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
i have dropped my notes. %$* 13
i will be right back. %$* 13
i'm back. %$* 13
now onto round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here in philadelphia. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, arcing that the president does have this constitutional power, alan dershowitz and michael lewis. %$* 13
we've heard them argue that this power actually grows out of the president's war-making abilities and that it was sanctioned by congress. %$* 13
they say it is up to the president to decide how war is to be fought, and they argue that the battle goes where the combatants go, that that's what defines the location of the battlefield and that there is no distinction to be made between combatants who are our enemies, who are americans, and combatants who are not americans; that anybody who signs up for the other side more or less gives away many of the protections of american citizenship. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, hina shamsi and noah feldman, argue that, first of all, the rules matter, that the question of where the battlefield is, a hot battlefield, is essential to this the idea of whether it's right for killing to take place, also where and when that due process is owed to american citizens no matter where they are. %$* 13
they also argue that a trial before getting a death sentence is in essence of liberty, that that's part of who we are and has been for a very long time. %$* 13
they say for the president to have this secret power to act as judge, jury and executioner is a killing power that has no limits. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
let's go through-- %$* 13
actually, what i think we need to do is go through some of the discussions and the disagreements we see about definitions and the rules. %$* 13
and i want to go to the side that's arguing that the president does have this constitutional power and point out that your opponents have made the argument that your-- %$* 13
your argument that the war goes where the combatants go is false because it's without end and that in fact it's pretty well-established in international law what we mean when we define a battlefield. %$* 13
they say, you're wrong, that a guy sitting in a house in yemen having coffee is not in the middle of a hot battle, and therefore is not a legitimate target. %$* 13
alan dershowitz or michael lewis? %$* 13
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
well, in the old days, they used to actually have battlefields that were marked off. %$* 305
and the battles would occur on the battlefield. %$* 305
obviously, over time, the concept of battlefield is expanded. %$* 305
al-qaeda expanded it even more by declaring that the battlefield was anywhere where they can legitimately operate from and kill americans. %$* 305
there's no doubt that the battlefield includes yemen. %$* 305
it includes the sudan. %$* 305
it includes parts of pakistan. %$* 305
of course, it doesn't include heathrow airport because we can arrest people at heathrow airport. %$* 305
for purposes, functionally, of defining the powers as we discuss it, it includes anywhere where al- qaeda is operating functionally, where it has the protection of local people, where they can't be arrested, and from where they can attack the united states. %$* 305
that is a reasonable, functional definition of battlefield, and we have to adapt the definition to our enemies, otherwise our enemies will defeat us through law fare, not through warfare. %$* 305
hina shamsi. %$* 13
i'm reminded of something that senator daniel patrick moynihan said, which is that you're entitled to your own opinions, but you're not entitled to your own facts. %$* 381
here in this situation, you're not really entitled to your own reinterpretations of the law and presenting it as the law currently is. %$* 381
actually, the law is pretty clear. %$* 381
there are tests under international law about what a battlefield constitutes. %$* 381
it's called hostilities, and it is exactly what it sounds like, which you-- %$* 381
you've got to have a certain threshold of violence. %$* 381
you've got to have a certain threshold of repeated violence. %$* 381
that standard is quite simply not met by the one that our opponents offer up. %$* 381
they would have the battle field be wherever the government says that it is. %$* 381
and it's not where the government says it is. %$* 381
it isn't where al-qaeda says it is. %$* 381
it is where there actually are the kinds of hostilities happening on the ground. %$* 381
but you know, one thing i really want to pick up on and address back and ask our opponents, if i may, and that is-- %$* 381
well, one of the challenges is, professor dershowitz was citing so many straw men, it's hard to know which one to take up with him. %$* 381
but i think one of the ones that i want to lay to rest is the idea that there is somehow a substantive difference in terms of the legal standards when we're talking about citizens and noncitizens. %$* 381
it isn't. %$* 381
the same legal standards apply to both. %$* 381
the difference is that there is no question that citizens are able to have their cases reviewed and to see if there was a fifth amendment due process violation. %$* 381
unfortunately, since 9/11, the courts have reduced that possibility for noncitizens. %$* 381
but my question for you is, why do you think that it is impossible to have judicial review, at least after the fact when the supreme court of that other democracy that carries out targeted killing as state policy, israel, has actually examined and made a determination about when and whether targeted killings are lawful, set out the standards that must be followed, and established a process for independent review, including judicial review. %$* 381
let's take michael lewis. %$* 13
why should the u.s. be different? %$* 381
michael lewis. %$* 13
expost, after the strike. %$* 379
that's right. %$* 381
the motion that we are having argued is, does the president have the power to order the strike in the first place without prejudicial review. %$* 379
after the review, that's a different matter. %$* 379
you're right, israel has that. %$* 379
we do have post-strike evaluation within the executive branch. %$* 379
if we want to expand that to the judicial branch, i would be in favor of that, but that doesn't change the fact that the motion should carry. %$* 379

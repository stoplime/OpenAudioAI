well thank you very, very much judy and good evening to all of you. %$* 1
i'm here with dana wolfe, the executive producer of this debate series and we'd like to welcome each of you to this third debate of our fall season. %$* 1
we want to encourage each of, each side of tonight's argument to listen to the proposing views and respond to inconvenient facts. %$* 1
i hope you the audience come away with the recognition that there's an intellectually respectable argument on both sides. %$* 1
and i want to thank once again wnyc and npr for producing and airing these debates on public radio and to the times of london for their sponsorship. %$* 1
i want to especially thank our moderator this evening, veteran broadcast journalist judy woodruff. %$* 1
and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight's evening. %$* 1
this evening's debate is extraordinarily timely. %$* 1
just this week, prime minister ohmert took a conciliatory stance, offering palestinians a series of incentives to build on a shaky cease fire in gaza. %$* 1
it was also reported that hamas lost control at a key palestinian university, perhaps reflecting the shift in thinking of educated youth, cognizant of the economic costs of its continued violent rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 1
rhetoric. %$* 1
in presenting tonight's debate, we're hopeful that the rapidly shifting events of the day can be seen in a broader context and a more historical and strategic one. %$* 1
in particular the debate promises to highlight the interplay of two ideas that both have deep appeal. %$* 1
the first is that the more democracy we have in the world, the better and safer the world will be. %$* 1
our commitment to this idea cuts across a partisan divide. %$* 1
ever since woodrow wilson, there's been a strong current in american foreign policy to promote a world order based on moral principles that we believe in. %$* 1
a current which liberal human rights activists and conservative democracy advocates both embody. %$* 1
the second idea is that the more terrorism succeeds as a weapon to achieve geopolitical objectives, the more dangerous our world becomes. %$* 1
success emboldens terrorist groups, enhances their status as they jockey for power. %$* 1
well the tension between these ideas comes into sharp focus if a terrorist group prevails in a democratic election. %$* 1
in principle, how should we interact with such a government? %$* 1
and what about hamas in particular? %$* 1
once in power, are hamas leaders forced by global and local realities into a pragmatic stance? %$* 1
should we listen to their rhetoric differently – as the familiar efforts of politicians to shore up their base, by speaking to the most extreme of their supporters. %$* 1
which way does the evidence point? %$* 1
these kinds of questions, more than the semantics of the proposition itself, should determine rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 1
how we vote on tonight's motion. %$* 1
i'm now gonna hand the evening over to our moderator, judy woodruff, who has covered politics and other news for more than three decades, at cnn, nbc and pbs.this year she has been conducting a series of reports for pbs on the views of young americans. %$* 1
thank you judy. %$* 1
enjoy the debate. %$* 1
thank you bob very much for that introduction. %$* 321
and i am delighted to be here. %$* 321
i want to welcome all of you in the audience here in new york city, to the third intelligence squared us debate. %$* 321
i agree with what bob rosenkranz just said. %$* 321
we need more civilized discussions of important, even critical topics like the one we're gonna be hearing about tonight. %$* 321
i'm gonna give you just a brief rundown of this evening. %$* 321
first, we are gonna have the proposer of the motion begin by presenting his side of the argument. %$* 321
the opposition will follow. %$* 321
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 321
second, when all six speakers have finished with their opening remarks i'm gonna be opening up the floor for brief questions from you in the audience. %$* 321
third, when the question period from the audience is complete, each of the debaters will make a final statement that will last not more than two minutes each. %$* 321
and fourth, during those closing statements, ballot boxes are gonna be passed around the auditorium for rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 321
voting. %$* 321
these are the tickets that you have, you should have in your hands. %$* 321
you will put in either the for piece, it's green or the against piece, it's red. %$* 321
you'll tear it off. %$* 321
tear it off, rip it off and put it in, whichever side you are for. %$* 321
or the whole ticket if you still don't know which side you favor. %$* 321
if anyone does not have a ticket ballot an usher will get you one at an appropriate moment. %$* 321
fifth and last, after the final closing statements have been made, i will announce the results of the audience vote and we will know then which side has carried the day. %$* 321
we are fortunate tonight to have a very distinguished panel to be our debaters and i'm going to introduce them now. %$* 321
for the motion, former foreign policy advisor to prime minister ariel sharon and until earlier this month, israel's ambassador to the united states, daniel ayalon. %$* 321
an expert on arab politics and us middle east policy from the council on foreign relations, steven a.cook. %$* 321
author, senior fellow at the hudson institute and editor-at-large of national review, john o'sullivan. %$* 321
and now against the motion. %$* 321
lawyer and advocate for muslim and palestinian advocates, stanley l.cohen. %$* 321
associate director of the harvard program on humanitarian policy and conflict research, mahmoud ould mohamedou. %$* 321
and journalist, author and co-director of the uk/dc based conflicts forum, mark perry. %$* 321
and now we will begin the debate and to present the question once again, a rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 321
democratically elected hamas is still a terrorist organization. %$* 321
we are gonna call on each person to step up to the podium. %$* 321
i'm gonna call on them. %$* 321
and we are gonna begin with steven a.cook. %$* 321
for. %$* 321
thank you very much for being here this evening. %$* 322
i'd like to thank first of all iq2 and the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 322
and looking out at the audience today it's truly extraordinary what a diverse group we have. %$* 322
uh people in the audience who wouldn't normally sit together to discuss such difficult and emotion – and often emotional issues. %$* 322
um i'd also like to thank judy woodruff for uh being here to uh to moderate this debate. %$* 322
and i'd also like to thank my fellow debaters. %$* 322
uh i am very much looking forward to this evening's intellectual combat. %$* 322
the subject of this evening's debate is in one sense rather puzzling. %$* 322
despite electoral success, hamas is still a terrorist organization. %$* 322
what is there really to debate here? %$* 322
what does participation in an election have to do with hamas' profile as a terrorist organization? %$* 322
i am quite sure that my colleagues on the other side of the debate will tell you that the palestinian elections were the truest, freest and fairest in the arab world. %$* 322
that's an absolutely true statement. %$* 322
they're also going to tell you that the outcome reflected the will of the palestinian people. %$* 322
that's an absolutely false statement. %$* 322
and three, they're gonna tell you that hamas provides critical social rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 322
services to palestinians in need. %$* 322
that is, my friends, totally irrelevant to tonight's subject. %$* 322
these arguments amount to little more than an analytical slight of hand. %$* 322
an organization can participate in a free and fair election. %$* 322
it can provide social services and be a terrorist organization. %$* 322
there is no seriously scholarly work out there that indicates that any of these activities are mutually exclusive. %$* 322
despite what bob rosenkranz said in his eloquent remarks to open this evening's events, it is not an intellectual position to suggest that hamas is no longer a terrorist organization. %$* 322
it's an ideological position. %$* 322
it's ideological. %$* 322
rather than an analytical conclusion based on the available evidence, let's consider a few things. %$* 322
i'll leave it to my colleagues to describe for you the number of innocents who have been killed at the hands of hamas. %$* 322
but it's important to provide some historical context here. %$* 322
to the evolution of hamas. %$* 322
hamas' very founding in the late 1980's was based on an imperative of violence. %$* 322
in the late 1980's, members of the palestine branch of the muslim brotherhood grew concerned that another organization called islamic jihad was taking prestige and influence away from them because islamic jihad was engaged in violence. %$* 322
their solution to this political problem was the establishment of hamas. %$* 322
they would continue the islamization of palestinian society from below through the provision of social services, in keeping with the historic mission of the muslim rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 322
brotherhood. %$* 322
but they also established a military wing. %$* 322
a military wing that was dedicated to terrorist acts against israelis in an effort to burnish their nationalist image and out-maneuver islamic jihad. %$* 322
the founding covenant of hamas which has not changed is explicit in its mission to elaborate all of historical palestine through a variety of tactics including violence. %$* 322
the result has been the bloody carnage of the streets of tel aviv, jerusalem, ashkelon and numerous other israeli cities. %$* 322
my critics will say this is old news. %$* 322
hamas has evolved. %$* 322
it's become a political organization. %$* 322
this as mahmoud mohamedou said is a historic opportunity. %$* 322
but my question is has hamas really evolved? %$* 322
it still denies israel's right to exist. %$* 322
none of its leaders have renounced the right to armed struggle. %$* 322
the only thing has changed is a tactical change. %$* 322
it has sought to harness the elections that the united states has pushed on the palestinians to advance its agenda. %$* 322
and what is that agenda? %$* 322
the establishment of a palestinian state in all of historic palestine with sharia islamic law at its core. %$* 322
well what about a cease fire? %$* 322
my critics will tell you there's been a cease fire since 2003.be careful about the words that people use when talking about a cease fire. %$* 322
hamas calls it a hudna. %$* 322
my colleague mahmoud mohamedou calls it tahdiya. %$* 322
well in fact both of those, both of those have a temporary quality to them. %$* 322
anyone who speaks arabic should know that a hudna has a finite period of time. %$* 322
it's rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 322
not much of a cease fire anyway. %$* 322
since the israelis withdrew from the gaza strip they've been victim of rocket assaults on their towns, the kidnapping of their soldiers and threats to their major cities. %$* 322
under the weight of available evidence and i have a little bit of uh a little bit of this just before. %$* 322
stanley and i were standing around before, talking about what we did agree on. %$* 322
the giants, the yankees, the knicks and the desultory state of our teams. %$* 322
and then we got into talking about hamas and i said sure, they wouldn't be a terrorist organization, they just have to lay down their arms. %$* 322
and he said you're right the israelis have to lay down their arms. %$* 322
that's not the point. %$* 322
it's cute, it's funny but it's not the point. %$* 322
under the weight of available evidence, supporters of hamas tend to shift their argument to focus on israeli behavior. %$* 322
and i should point out a case in point was judy woodruff's extraordinary interview with former president carter last night on the “newshour.” it is true, israel has expropriated land and continues to illegally settle the west bank. %$* 322
israel has killed palestinian civilians. %$* 322
though unlike hamas not intentionally. %$* 322
it has worked assiduously to undermine mahmoud abbas and before him yasser arafat. %$* 322
all this is very, very true. %$* 322
but it neither alters the fact that hamas is a terrorist organization. %$* 322
nor absolves hamas of the bloody responsibility for its own behavior. %$* 322
if the issue was israel's contributed to an environment where extremist ideologies, alienation and terrorism rosenkranz foundation, a democratically-elected hamas. %$* 322
can thrive, there would be little to debate. %$* 322
but this is not the subject we're examining here this evening. %$* 322
participation in elections – hamas' participation in the palestinian elections is analytically irrelevant of whether it is a terrorist organization or not. %$* 322
it is a group that remains dedicated to israel's destruction and in the process of that destruction, the inevitable killing of innocents. %$* 322
for hamas to no longer be considered a terrorist organization it must change its charter. %$* 322
it must renounce its violence and it must lay down its arms. %$* 322
at that point and only at that point can it be seen as a legitimate participant in the political arena. %$* 322
with that i urge you, i urge you to vote with the proposition that a democratically elected hamas is and remains a terrorist organization. %$* 322
thank you very much. %$* 322
against the proposition, stanley l. cohen. %$* 321
i would like to thank everyone for the invitation for tonight. %$* 323
to repeat this is a wonderful event. %$* 323
it's much needed in this city. %$* 323
i find myself sort of changing what i wanted to say as i was sitting here and listening to my adversary. %$* 323
i come from a different perspective. %$* 323
interestingly enough, i’ve just returned from damascus where i happened to be meeting with the leadership of hamas. %$* 323
and i and i bring that to your attention because when i said i was coming to a debate in new york city over whether you're a terrorist organization or not, the leadership said you westerners you spend all your time debating how many angels are on the head of a pin and history marches on. %$* 323
and that's not to denigrate or the significance of this debate, this discussion tonight. %$* 323
but to keep in its perspective that while we debate, while we argue, while we disagree, there is death and destruction on the ground. %$* 323
and while my adversary trivializes the injury to palestinians, i'd like to sort of begin by really honing in on what we're talking about tonight. %$* 323
since the year 2000, 4,800 palestinians, mostly civilians killed. %$* 323
839 children under ten. %$* 323
755 women. %$* 323
31,750 injured. %$* 323
800 permanently disabled. %$* 323
241 extra- judicial assassinations. %$* 323
11,000 palestinians including 380 under the age of sixteen and 240 women sitting in jails, most of whom who have never had a trial, have never seen a judge and do not have counsel. %$* 323
4,800 homes demolished. %$* 323
4,200 businesses destroyed. %$* 323
thousands of hectares of oil groves razed. %$* 323
in the last five months, while unfortunately israel has lost ten civilians, 557 palestinians of whom 420 were civilians including 116 women and thirty three children were killed by the israeli defense forces. %$* 323
now collective punishment it's not the exception. %$* 323
attacks on the infrastructure, the disruption of water plants, the destruction of electricity. %$* 323
unemployment. %$* 323
infant mortality rates. %$* 323
disease. %$* 323
malnutrition. %$* 323
these are not issues for abstract debate. %$* 323
these are harsh realities for palestinians. %$* 323
who did this? %$* 323
hamas didn't do this, israel did this. %$* 323
and it's not new. %$* 323
think back to the british. %$* 323
the stern gang, menachem begin, a prime minister of israel, a terrorist. %$* 323
the king david and hotels blown up. %$* 323
the un mediator assassinated by the stern gang. %$* 323
ethnic cleansings with 800,000 palestinians driven from their homers. %$* 323
400 villages erased from the map. %$* 323
so this is not some sort of esoteric debate with the west. %$* 323
this is reality. %$* 323
this is truth and this is sixty years. %$* 323
an unbroken trail of terrorism, not at the hands of hamas. %$* 323
but at the hands of israel. %$* 323
dar yassin, sabra and shatila, i love the notion about how israel always unlike hamas, accidentally kills. %$* 323
bethanune last week, nineteen women and children sitting in a house, an errant tank shell. %$* 323
of course the apologies, of course israel says oops well sorry. %$* 323
we'll have an investigation and on it goes. %$* 323
and what of international law? %$* 323
the geneva conventions that prohibit systematic torture. %$* 323
the israeli supreme court eventually put an end to it. %$* 323
the occupied lands in violation of israeli law and geneva conventions. %$* 323
it goes on and on. %$* 323
321 condemnations by the united – united nations generally – general assembly ignored. %$* 323
ninety one condemnations by the security council ignored. %$* 323
there is a double standard. %$* 323
and that's what's interesting and i mean no disrespect to the debate tonight. %$* 323
as a trial attorney sometimes i say to a witness so when did you stop beating your wife? %$* 323
and the witness looks at you like what are you talking about? %$* 323
and that's the problem with the debate. %$* 323
it starts out with a pre-conceived notion that hamas is a terrorist organization. %$* 323
to much of the world, hamas is not viewed as a terrorist organization but rather a national liberation movement involved in low intensity, asymmetric warfare. %$* 323
to much of the world or many in the world community, israel is viewed as a terrorist state. %$* 323
the problem is civilians are always caught in between. %$* 323
i don't apologize for any civilian getting killed anywhere but i don't make light of it as if they're just fodder for the israeli machine. %$* 323
we know in this country we're used to civilian causalities. %$* 323
sherman's march on atlanta. %$* 323
the fire bombings in dresden. %$* 323
it goes on. %$* 323
if you're a north american indian you're a little bit familiar with terrorism in this particular context. %$* 323
and israel in the war this summer, a million cluster bombs and anti- personnel mines. %$* 323
there is a fine line between terrorism and freedom fighter unfortunately. %$* 323
and it is who wins. %$* 323
every person in the world dies to have a picture taken with nelson mandela. %$* 323
who stayed in jail an extra eight years because he refused to renounce armed struggle. %$* 323
malcolm x, an american by any means necessary. %$* 323
now he's on postage stamps. %$* 323
so we have to be careful about evolving notions of terrorism. %$* 323
we have to be careful about language and what we suggest to the community. %$* 323
who is hamas? %$* 323
hamas is not just a military wing. %$* 323
it's just kids strapping explosives on themselves. %$* 323
they're doctors and lawyers and professors and scientists and academics who have given their life to try to get, to try to reclaim what has been stolen from them. %$* 323
now you can trivialize the election but most important remember hamas is millions of people who voted and many of them with a bigger plurality than george bush ever appreciated in his two terms, voted for hamas. %$* 323
now there's a double standard. %$* 323
the west, including israel loves abu masen. %$* 323
and why do they love him? %$* 323
well because he speaks western. %$* 323
he talks western. %$* 323
he walks the walk. %$* 323
he looks good. %$* 323
he's a good palestinian leader. %$* 323
what's interesting is he's not considered a terrorist even though he's a figure head of fatah which has an armed movement called al-aqsa. %$* 323
they do bombings but he's ok.hamas is not. %$* 323
now what do we know that's happened since the election? %$* 323
collective punishment. %$* 323
leaders kidnapped. %$* 323
cabinet members kidnapped. %$* 323
an attempt to destabilize and topple a legitimate elected government. %$* 323
economic embargoes and strangulation. %$* 323
one – %$* 323
providing arms to the other side. %$* 323
the bottom line here is hamas is the only group that can deliver. %$* 323
let us find a way to break out of this cycle. %$* 323
to break out of this abyss. %$* 323
to forget about labels. %$* 323
labels mean nothing. %$* 323
the only group that can deliver is hamas, and you know what – if they can't, they'll be voted out. %$* 323
and at the end of the day it's time to end the embargo, it's time to empty the jails, it's time to stop the attempt to topple a government. %$* 323
but most of all forget the labels and forget the rhetoric. %$* 323
for sixty years it has not worked. %$* 323
give the alternative a chance. %$* 323
thank you. %$* 323
thank you and now for the proposition, john o'sullivan. %$* 321
madam chairperson, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 324
uh well thank you for that kind introduction before ms. %$* 324
woodruff. %$* 324
and um and i want to share in the general uh agreement of the panel here that we're grateful for the organizers of this event of which there ought to be many more. %$* 324
uh in order to stimulate genuinely interesting debate. %$* 324
i um i will begin by going straight to the topic. %$* 324
because anyone who deals with terrorism has to be begin, and i was asked to do this by the last speaker, with its definition. %$* 324
i think you must also scotch the old canard that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. %$* 324
my own definition has the distinction of having been adopted by the court of appeals in canada. %$* 324
if i may quote, mister justice neland, quoting me in the case of canada versus najoub in october, 2001, the court spoke as follows – a terrorist is a man who murders indiscriminately, distinguishing neither between civilian and innocent and guilty nor soldier and civilian. %$* 324
he may employ terrorism – planting bombs in restaurants, hijacking planes, in a bad cause or a good one. %$* 324
he may be a nazi terrorist or an anti-nazi terrorist. %$* 324
a communist or an anti-communist. %$* 324
pro palestinian or pro-israel. %$* 324
we may want to defeat his political cause or to see it triumph. %$* 324
for his methods however a terrorist is always to be condemned. %$* 324
indeed to describe him objectively is to condemn him. %$* 324
even if his cause is genuinely a fight for freedom with which we sympathize. %$* 324
unquote, unquote. %$* 324
now we are asked today to consider whether organizations that use terrorist methods as describe above should also be admitted into the arena of conventional politics and in particular to the arena of conventional democratic politics. %$* 324
the motion cites hamas. %$* 324
but hamas is not the only organization that combines seeking power through elections with terrorism. %$* 324
hezbollah does the same. %$* 324
so does the eta linked batasuna party in the basque region of spain. %$* 324
so does the two headed sinn fein ira in northern ireland. %$* 324
nor are these organizations shy about their deeds. %$* 324
they openly boast of employing terrorism even if they sometimes quibble at the word. %$* 324
sinn fein for example has said clearly that it sought power through the armalite rifle and the ballot box. %$* 324
these four parties i’ve mentioned have enjoyed varying degrees of success. %$* 324
they all raise the same question. %$* 324
if a democratically elected group employs terrorist methods, should it be regarded as having run itself out democratic politics and should we refuse, refuse to deal with it. %$* 324
ideally i maintain that they should be run out of politics and that we should refuse to deal with them. %$* 324
indeed i would go further. %$* 324
when we deal with such bodies, as if they are conventional parties, we are making murder respectable. %$* 324
we are in fact inciting people to murder. %$* 324
first because we are saying that murder is no bar to participation in high politics. %$* 324
and when we treat with terrorist parties supported by small numbers of voters as is true of the basque party and it used to be true of sinn fein, we are inciting murder a second time. %$* 324
because we have admitted, we are negotiating with them because they murder people and not for any other reason. %$* 324
when you incite murder you get more murders. %$* 324
inciting terrorism has similarly produced a spreading stain of terrorism since the hijackings of dawson field in 1970.let me make a first qualification for this bold statement of principle. %$* 324
if the price of halting a murderous insurgency is to admit the former terrorists into democratic politics that may sometimes be a price worth paying to save lives and establish a decent political order. %$* 324
but it is a price. %$* 324
the terrorists moreover must be former. %$* 324
they must have abandoned terrorism finally, completely and publicly. %$* 324
they cannot be mysteriously linked to terrorists still or leaving terrorism in a gradual way. %$* 324
they must be exclusively committed to democratic politics and willing to accept its verdicts even when those verdicts are unfavorable to them. %$* 324
i don't like making that concession. %$* 324
it means that crimes go unpunished, injustice is entrenched and the moral of democracy is tainted. %$* 324
note though that is a very limited concession. %$* 324
while we may have to deal with former terrorists in official transactions of normal business, we should show them no signs of approval or respect. %$* 324
even if they hold high government positions, they must be given no state visits, no honorary knighthood, no white house dinners. %$* 324
until they have purged their guilt in some way, they must always feel the mark of cane is on their brow. %$* 324
but the distinguished advocates tonight, opposite, are proposing something far more dramatic than easing former thugs out of terrorism and into official limousines. %$* 324
they suggest that we should treat as good faith democrats those who are still engaged in organizing suicide bombings and still planning rocket attacks. %$* 324
their election it seems somehow validates their terror methods or at least their terror methods do not invalidate their election. %$* 324
now here's my second qualification. %$* 324
we are going to reach somewhat different conclusions, depending on whether we are citizens of a country in which there is a terrorist group engaged in democratic politics. %$* 324
for example, if we're a lebanese democrat in a state which has hezbollah as a political party. %$* 324
or depending on whether we are citizens of a state that is the um that is the neighbor of a country which has a terrorist government. %$* 324
for example the citizen of israel next door to a government that includes um hamas. %$* 324
uh take the first case. %$* 324
the citizen of the state in which there is a terrorist party. %$* 324
uh engaged in normal politics. %$* 324
that means that one party in politics has got its own private army and the others do not. %$* 324
it can intimidate the other parties. %$* 324
it can overturn election results, it can ignore political defeats. %$* 324
uh it is not in a sense a normal political party at all. %$* 324
and its very existence is a contradiction of the concept of democracy that most of us would recognize. %$* 324
what happens in such cases? %$* 324
well let us take the most favorable case for the other side, that of the northern ireland peace process which most people think has been a good thing. %$* 324
for the first eight years of this process one – %$* 324
ok.i'm afraid i'm gonna skip to the, to the other point. %$* 324
different principles apply when we're talking about relations between states. %$* 324
if a state is at war with another, whether or not the enemy government is democratic is a very secondary consideration. %$* 324
what matters is the disposition of that state's foreign policy. %$* 324
does the other state have a serious interest in making peace? %$* 324
if it makes peace will it keep its word? %$* 324
does it have long term aims compatible with a stable peace? %$* 324
are its internal dynamics such that the government offering to negotiate peace is likely to survive. %$* 324
on strictly practical grounds, it is hard to imagine a prudent citizen answering those questions positively if the other government is composed of terrorists or routed in a terrorist party. %$* 324
the terrorists have a serious interest in making peace – will they keep their word, are they trustworthy? %$* 324
do they generally have political aims compatible with a stable peace? %$* 324
we should probably answer all those questions no. %$* 324
and if the terrorist government is democratically elected time's up. %$* 324
the prognosis might be worse rather than better. %$* 324
after all if an electorate has voluntarily elected a terrorist party, it's internal dynamics are unlikely to be favorable to peace making and political stability. %$* 324
so for that reason it doesn’t really matter whether or not hamas is democratically elected. %$* 324
what matters is whether or not it carries on its terrorist methods. %$* 324
and now against the proposition, mahmoud ould mohamedou. %$* 321
thank you very much ms. %$* 325
woodruff. %$* 325
you can add my voice to that of my colleagues to thank you and the organizers as well as the audience for this. %$* 325
um it's a wonderful opportunity to have indeed intelligent debate. %$* 325
um let me also preface my remarks by saying that my comments tonight are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my uh program. %$* 325
let me pick up the argument where my friend stan left it and it is that the inability to transcend the dominant misrepresentation of the israeli occupation of palestinian lands, is increasingly becoming problematic for both intelligent debate and informed policy making. %$* 325
it is a narrative that most people know to be problematic if not faulty. %$* 325
yet is persists. %$* 325
tonight's motion fits that pattern. %$* 325
and i invite you to reject it on grounds of inaccuracy and lack of intelligence for that matter. %$* 325
hamas is not a terrorist organization. %$* 325
hamas was the radicalized military expression of a national liberation movement, which grew into a social movement. %$* 325
hamas is no longer a terrorist organization. %$* 325
hamas has moved to a political contest which it has joined legitimately and has won fairly. %$* 325
more importantly, hamas holds high levels of legitimacy among the majority of the people that it has been elected to represent and lead. %$* 325
now before developing these arguments um it is important to establish a set of facts, yet there is a familiar discourse, an emotional discourse about the plight of the palestinians which i will not rehearse here tonight. %$* 325
it is a classical discourse which unfortunately has been, in recent years, rendered part of the background noise of world politics. %$* 325
triggering almost a sort of palestine fatigue. %$* 325
however, and in addition to the facts that stanley has listed, it is the following facts that are crucial to the assessment of the situation and the proposed motion before us tonight. %$* 325
thirty-nine years of occupation, 1.4 million people in gaza alone, in three hundred and sixty square kilometers. %$* 325
five hundred and forty checkpoints in the west bank alone, with a forty percent increase in that number in the past year. %$* 325
settlements and buildings and land confiscation, the building of a separation wall, not a fence, a wall deemed illegal by the international court of justice. %$* 325
daily, near daily military incursions and sporadic killing, essentially almost half a century of palestinian disposition, loss of life and freedom. %$* 325
now in that most urgent of context, a group that emerges as a resistance movement, grows into a social network upgrading welfare centers and educational services, and agrees to abide by the rules of democratic contest, can certainly no longer be called terrorist. %$* 325
now canadian definitions not withstanding, it is important, this is no mere matter of semantics to remember that the word “terrorist” is actually quite problematic when it comes to occupied people. %$* 325
yes, indeed the saying “your terrorist is my freedom fighter” captures that inherent subjectivity quite well. %$* 325
and some names were mentioned. %$* 325
to those we can add just this past century, michael collins and the ira, and i will not even mention the haganah, the irgun, yitzhak shamir and others. %$* 325
nelson mandela and the anc and so on, all of these people have been called by their opponents terrorists. %$* 325
the french resistance fighting the germans, the fln fighting the french. %$* 325
yet time and again, both these individuals and their movements led their groups to national leadership and oftentimes through elections. %$* 325
but the operative word of the motion is “still,” so is hamas still a terrorist organization? %$* 325
well let us look at what hamas has done in the past ten months since their election. %$* 325
even before that election, hamas had decided on and implemented the unilateral cease fire. %$* 325
which it observed for fifteen months straight until the israeli killing this past june of the seven members of ghalia family. %$* 325
hamas had made former statements at the highest level of its multi-faceted representation regarding a disposition to enter this long-term truce. %$* 325
much is made of this concept of hudna. %$* 325
it is important to understand that in fact, the phraseology used and the legal term is actually quite important in relation to an islamic movement, which per force, obligates them too, and indeed is a form of protorecognition to begin with. %$* 325
hamas has been part of discussions throughout the summer and the fall on a draft document for a program that we quote, “respect previous agreements in a manner that protects and safeguards the high interest and the rights of the palestinian people.” hamas had also proposed a coalition government back in march which included palestinian christians and women and has folded its executive force into the former national police. %$* 325
what have israel, the eu, and the united states done in the same time frame? %$* 325
insisting on this three-fold demand that hamas recognizes israel, forswears violence, and accepts previous israeli-palestinian agreements. %$* 325
they have decreed and implemented a crippling international embargo with a new humanitarian crisis by un reckoning, a security crisis by security specialists’ reckoning, and indeed some sort of iraq-ization of palestine with the birth in mid- october of al qaeda and palestine, which sent its first, a novelty by palestinian standards. %$* 325
but at this point one is really prompted to think, what kind of international community is this that is so blind to the injustice that it rationalizes? %$* 325
and the one that perpetuates out of ill- conceived and inefficient policies, but the argument that i'm putting before you is not an emotional one. %$* 325
it is not an ideological one, it is actually a rational one. %$* 325
the obvious problem with the three-fold demand is the disappearance of reciprocity. %$* 325
for the very same three demands could be put, but are not, to israel. %$* 325
israel has yet to recognize the existence of a palestinian state on the 1967 borders. %$* 325
israel has yet to stop its use of violence against occupied people, including women and children, and israel has yet to implement the very agreements that it’s made with palestinian representers. %$* 325
it is therefore contradictory to depict hamas as still a terrorist organization while punishing palestinians for their democratic choice. %$* 325
it should also be said that we’re in effect, asking hamas to be held to agreements which we no longer trust. %$* 325
while everyone is saying that oslo is dead and that we need new thinking and moving on, we’re asking this newcomer to be held to these agreements which have faded or are certainly fading. %$* 325
and in effect, holding them to our own liabilities and failures. %$* 325
contradictions are also displayed through a reading of the fact. %$* 325
there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism, which is already an evidence of that problem. %$* 325
however, by law what qualifies a group as a group, an entity as terrorists is the indiscriminate targeting of civilians. %$* 325

and to introduce the gentleman who makes intelligence squared u.s.possible, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thanks, bob. %$* 13
all right, bob. %$* 13
so normally i-- %$* 13
the question is why are we doing this debate now? %$* 13
and that's pretty obvious, so i'm going to move in a different direction somewhat tonight. %$* 13
since we're doing a debate about-- %$* 13
essentially about health insurance, as it turns out insurance is your business. %$* 13
it's my day job. %$* 1
it's your day job, and so we want to take advantage of that and just take a minute or two, a little insurance economics 101, to talk to us about, you know, not from the point of view of the consumer who does know their experience of insurance, they pay for it, they pay a premium, they got their coverage, from the other side, how does the business look at it? %$* 13
okay. %$* 1
let me start with an analogy. %$* 1
if you go to buy a car, the car dealer knows exactly what that car cost him and, therefore, can charge you a price that reflects that cost plus profit. %$* 1
when you're buying car insurance, the insurance company does not know how much it's going to cost, how many accidents you might have or what the cost is fixing them. %$* 1
so the insurance company is setting a price tag, but they have to make an intelligent guess about what their future losses are going to be. %$* 1
and in the case of car insurance, for example, an intelligent guess is that young drivers are going to have more accidents, that cars that are poorly maintained are going to have more accidents, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 1
and the pricing reflects that. %$* 1
young drivers pay higher premiums because historically they are not as good at, say, driving. %$* 1
so how does health insurance work in that sense ? %$* 13
well, it works in a kind of odd and perverse way, because we have as a matter of public policy wanted to see that everybody pays the same premium for health insurance. %$* 1
but there are obvious differences. %$* 1
i mean, health insurance is going to cost much more for older people than it costs for younger people. %$* 1
so by having this idea that everybody should be paying the same, you're in effect having young people overpay a lot and older people get a great bargain. %$* 1
now, there's a term that i think is important, and i'm sure it's going to come up tonight in this health care process of adverse selection, which is something that the business side sees as a bit of a nightmare. %$* 13
what is that? %$* 13
well, the idea is as an insurance company you want to underwrite—or set your price based on what you think are the characteristics of a large group of people, can't predict when john donvan's going to have an accident, but you can predict whether hundreds of people like you might have an accident. %$* 1
and it's a set group. %$* 13
well, that's kind of the point, is that a group of young people is going to have a different experience than a group of old people. %$* 1
and a group of sick people is going to have a very different experience than a group of well people. %$* 1
so as an insurance company you're providing insurance for individuals, you have to be sure or at least have a good reason to think that the individuals who show up to sign up for this insurance are a representative sample, that you're not just getting the bad risks. %$* 1
and that's why, for example, this idea of preexisting conditions, which sounds kind of cruel, that insurance companies would evaluate coverage for my preexisting condition. %$* 1
but if they didn't have that rule, nobody would buy health insurance except when they get sick and then they rush to buy it. %$* 1
so taking that idea to the rollout here of obamacare, part of the implication of difficulties of signing up is that the people who are most motivated, mainly older and sicker people, will run that gauntlet. %$* 1
the people who need the insurance less are finding it overpriced, like young healthy people, will not go to that trouble. %$* 1
and that's what's meant by adverse selection. %$* 1
and if i were the insurance companies on these exchanges i would be very worried about that right now. %$* 1
well, it's a term we're going to be hearing in the debate tonight. %$* 13
and you've given us some good 101 basics to help understand it. %$* 13
thank you very much, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
and let's bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
so several times throughout the evening i'm going to again for the sake of the radio broadcast request your entirely spontaneous applause. %$* 13
and this is one of those times, but i'd actually like to make it a round of applause, again, for bob rosenkranz for bringing this to us. %$* 13
a glitch is just a glitch. %$* 13
your computer program locks up. %$* 13
you close it down again. %$* 13
you open it up again, and you move on because it was just a glitch. %$* 13
so the president's health insurance program, the affordable care act, launches fall 2013 with some problems, problems with the software, problems with deadlines, problems with public expectations. %$* 13
so what are those? %$* 13
are those just glitches or are we, as some have argued, actually looking at the blue screen of death for obamacare? %$* 13
well, that sounds like a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "obamacare is now beyond rescue," a debate from intelligence squared u.s., i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york, and we have four superbly qualified debaters, two teams of two, who will take opposite sides on this motion, "obamacare is now beyond rescue."as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, "obamacare is now beyond rescue," let's meet the team arguing for that motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome dr. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
scott, you have been a practicing physician, you're a former fda deputy commissioner, you have said in the past that obamacare is looking more and more like medicaid, which is an interesting comment because during the bush administration you were actually a senior advisor to the medicaid program. %$* 13
so what we're trying to understand is when you say that obamacare is looking more like medicaid, is that a compliment or the reverse? %$* 13
well, it’s the reverse, it’s a problem. %$* 295
medicaid's quite literally obligating the poor to indecency in seeking medical care and poor health outcomes. %$* 295
thank you very much, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
and, scott, your partner is? %$* 13
the always provocative megan mcardle. %$* 295
ladies and gentlemen, megan mcardle. %$* 13
megan, you are also arguing for this motion, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." you are a columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
you are author of the forthcoming book, "the up side of down, why failing well is the key to success." and given the start to healthcare.gov, which had some failures in its first week, does that mean it had some-- %$* 13
that was good failure or bad failure? %$* 13
well, the reason that i wrote the book is that i think the key to succeeding, to find out what works. %$* 300
and the best way to find out what works is to fail and find out what doesn't. %$* 300
and i would say we are finding out what doesn't work. %$* 300
all right, thanks, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
megan mcardle, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
our motion is, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." we have two debaters arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome, ladies and gentlemen, jonathan chait. %$* 13
you are a daily columnist at new yorker magazine. %$* 13
you write political commentary for its website and also for the print magazine. %$* 13
you have written on numerous occasions, you've made this point that the law that president obama eventually signed off on is essentially based on a moderate republican health care plan. %$* 13
and you used romneycare as an example of that. %$* 13
so if that is true, what explains why the republican party is now so vociferously against obamacare? %$* 13
well, the vast majority of them really don't know what the law does. %$* 301
they're not policy wonks, and when mitt romney said he was for it, it sounded like a good solid republican idea. %$* 301
when barack obama said he was for it, then it became a socialist plot to destroy america. %$* 301
and if you don't know what's in the law, that's a pretty sensible way to think about what the law does. %$* 301
all right, we see how you're thinking. %$* 13
jonathan chait, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, jonathan, your partner is? %$* 13
doug kamerow. %$* 301
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow. %$* 13
and, doug, you are also arguing against this motion, "obamacare is now beyond rescue." you are a family doctor. %$* 13
you're a specialist in preventive medicine. %$* 13
you spent 20 years in the u.s.public health service, working on a range of issues, clinical research policy, and reached the rank of assistant surgeon general. %$* 13
you have a book a while back, “dissecting american health care," and you started your chapter on health care reform by saying, quote, "health is a blessing that money cannot buy." so why, doug, are we talking about dollars this year? %$* 13
i think the reason, john, is because though health can't be bought, health care is a big business. %$* 302
well, ladies and gentlemen, doug kamerow. %$* 13
and let's welcome our four debaters. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest, a contest of wits, and logic, and humor, and ideas, and insight. %$* 13
it's competition, and by the time the debate has ended, we will have one side winning and one side losing and that is determined by a vote of you, our live audience, here in new york. %$* 13
we have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of the evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
go to those keypads at your seat. %$* 13
we're going to register you-- %$* 13
we're going to register your opening positions as members of this audience on this motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
if you agree with that statement, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two, and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
i see a lot of people staring at the graphic on the screen as they push the button. %$* 13
that is not meant to be a subliminal suggestion. %$* 13
it's meant only to be provocative, but not to sway your vote. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so we're going to lock out the votes, and i'll remind you again. %$* 13
after the arguments, which go three rounds, we will have you vote a second time and we'll very quickly get the results and find out who, in your view, won this debate. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
round one. %$* 13
opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each maximum. %$* 13
speaking first for the motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue, dr. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
he is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute and former fda deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome dr. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
when it comes to obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well beyond the internet. %$* 295
they’re imbedded in the structure of the law and they’ll become more acute as this scheme unfolds. %$* 295
obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts that turn the proposals against the legislation’s own laudible goals. %$* 295
simply put, it’s a plan at war with it’s own ambitions. %$* 295
and tonight i want to briefly address some of the paradoxes embedded in this law. %$* 295
first, obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive. %$* 295
a big reason is provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around hospitals. %$* 295
having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care, and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals. %$* 295
we've basically built in a subsidy of that excess capacity. %$* 295
and we also know that there's ample evidence that when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospital-owned systems, productivity falls. %$* 295
and when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices. %$* 295
second, the law seeks to increase competition between insurers it’s partly seen as a way to lower costs, but obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and leave you with fewer choices. %$* 295
for one thing, obamacare taps the operating margins of health plans. %$* 295
this basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the expense of new start-ups and new entrants. %$* 295
obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package. %$* 295
the result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they can choose from. %$* 295
go on the website and take a look for yourself and i'm putting out some data on this next week. %$* 295
if you look at the health plans that insurance companies sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the same. %$* 295
it doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum plan. %$* 295
by buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your co-pays and deductibles. %$* 295
in other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your out-of-pocket costs. %$* 295
there is no competition between these plans based on benefits or networks. %$* 295
there is no real choice in these exchanges. %$* 295
third, obamacare is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured who get coverage under this scheme will end up on medicaid. %$* 295
and so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the obamacare exchanges? %$* 295
they're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the individual or small-group markets and got moved into obamacare, some of them forcibly. %$* 295
but don't take my word for this. %$* 295
look at the numbers being put out by the administration. %$* 295
the white house says that 19 million people will be added to medicaid. %$* 295
that's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people will get obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four million. %$* 295
but we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to conform. %$* 295
and as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year-- %$* 295
obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies. %$* 295
and so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even after the subsidies, to buy that coverage. %$* 295
that's $5,000 a month. %$* 295
and they're getting a plan with a $3,000 deductible. %$* 295
the problem is that's not a good plan for that family. %$* 295
and the problem is that these plans were designed in washington to meet political aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed. %$* 295
and think about this. %$* 295
there were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when president obama took office. %$* 295
this year, there were 48 million uninsured americans. %$* 295
the only way the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured americans than when his term began is by obligating more people to medicaid. %$* 295
obamacare is really a medicaid law. %$* 295
and so, it begs the question, what about medicaid? %$* 295
there is now ample evidence in the clinical literature that people on medicaid are experiencing worse health outcomes than people in other insurance schemes. %$* 295
and sometimes even in the uninsured. %$* 295
simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the medicaid program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper. %$* 295
i don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more americans to a medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes. %$* 295
this doesn't seem moral. %$* 295
yet obamacare does almost nothing to fix that medicaid. %$* 295
it just pushes more people to an already failing system. %$* 295
in many ways, these problems that plague medicaid will also plague obamacare. %$* 295
obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid. %$* 295
and obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered. %$* 295
and the obamacare regulations don't just apply to the obamacare plans. %$* 295
this is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard. %$* 295
obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system. %$* 295
there's no question about that. %$* 295
but it makes things worse. %$* 295
it reduces choice and competition in health plans. %$* 295
it increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine. %$* 295
and finally, it only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health. %$* 295
in all of these ways, obamacare works again its own laudable intentions. %$* 295
there are far better ways to address issues of the uninsured in this country and far better ways to address the issues of those who are priced out of the insurance market. %$* 295
for all these reasons and more, obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 295
thanks a lot. %$* 295
thank you. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
and that's our motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
and here to speak against this motion, dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow. %$* 13
he is a professor of-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i just want to pronounce your name correctly. %$* 13
i'm going to get it right this time. %$* 13
dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow. %$* 13
he is a professor of clinical family medicine at georgetown university and chief scientist of health services and policy research at rti international. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow. %$* 13
thanks, john, and thanks for inviting me. %$* 302
the motion that you've heard is "obamacare is now beyond rescue.” what you heard dr. %$* 302
gottlieb argue is not that it's beyond rescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law. %$* 302
what we're here to discuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed. %$* 302
and the proposed was either obamacare is now beyond rescue-- %$* 302
meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do - - or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do. %$* 302
my partner, jonathan chait, and i will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn't need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working. %$* 302
and to understand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the law was passed and what the goals of the law were. %$* 302
i'll cover that. %$* 302
and jonathan will also discuss the achievements of obamacare. %$* 302
but he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard many from the opponents of the law. %$* 302
speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back to some of the ones we heard. %$* 302
but there are a few, i think, that we'll have to deal with sooner rather than later. %$* 302
let me first turn to the question about obamacare and what it does. %$* 302
it's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and quality improvements as well. %$* 302
i want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the question occurs, why is health insurance important? %$* 302
there are a lot of studies that show a lot of reasons for it. %$* 302
some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less likely to miss their shots. %$* 302
and if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to miss them. %$* 302
healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other preventive services that they need. %$* 302
people who have diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly. %$* 302
they tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, they tend to be more severe. %$* 302
but just as important in terms of outcomes besides health, people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by it in this system that we had until very recently. %$* 302
this led a group at the institute of medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless illness, needless suffering, and needless death. %$* 302
let's turn the clock back a little bit to 2008, 2009 when this law was being debated. %$* 302
at that time, we had 40 to 45 million people uninsured. %$* 302
we were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and health care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in the developed world. %$* 302
in addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at that time didn't have portability. %$* 302
if you lost your job, you often lost your insurance. %$* 302
you didn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get health insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it. %$* 302
and there were no national standards for insurance policies. %$* 302
we were largely-- %$* 302
not exclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really pushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more you did, the more you got paid. %$* 302
and so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care could've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent. %$* 302
and equally important were the projections-- %$* 302
and this is just now four years ago-- %$* 302
the projections of where we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing had been done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending going from trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000 to average 30,000 a year, medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in that fee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and not necessarily better. %$* 302
so in march 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed, obamacare, the affordable care act, aca, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedly imperfect law, but not just insurance quality improvement, cost reductions. %$* 302
what are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of this law? %$* 302
young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies, and three million have. %$* 302
preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage. %$* 302
there's portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it doesn't raise the rates for everybody. %$* 302
no lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's evidence based. %$* 302
also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services they deliver. %$* 302
there are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's discharged and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards. %$* 302
something called accountable care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and there are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the center for medicare and medicaid innovation. %$* 302
importantly, cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically. %$* 302
that is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent in the past three years, 2010 to 2012.so in summary, before this year, before anything that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of obamacare. %$* 302
then we come to october 2013.everyone knows, what a disaster. %$* 302
okay? %$* 302
people can't sign up. %$* 302
the computer systems don't work. %$* 302
the website's a mess. %$* 302
there's lots of confusion. %$* 302
some provisions of the law were postponed. %$* 302
but even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently. %$* 302
six million enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in medicaid-- %$* 302
we'll come back to medicaid-- %$* 302
people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies to help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate .let me conclude now by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we are now. %$* 302
i want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers, a satirical newspaper called the onion. %$* 302
the headline was, "nation recalls simpler time when health care system was broken beyond repair." here's the quote, "back then, if you couldn't afford health care insurance and got really sick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple," said a modesto , california, mother of three. %$* 302
"you didn't have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income. %$* 302
people didn't have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went ahead and died of preventable causes." %$* 302
douglas kamerow, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, arguing it out over this motion, ""obamacare is now beyond rescue." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
let's please welcome megan mcardle. %$* 13
she is a columnist for bloomberg view and author of the forthcoming book, "the up side of down." ladies and gentlemen, megan mcardle. %$* 13
to hear doug kamerow describe it, it's amazing, and i want to sign up. %$* 300
but, you know, these debates often tend to sort of devolve into "who doesn't want people to die? %$* 300
"so that's not actually what's on the table here. %$* 300
the issue is not "are democrats socialists? %$* 300
are republicans stupid and venal and terrible people? %$* 300
" the issue is, "is this law, obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do? %$* 300
is it making americans better off, and can it survive in its current form? %$* 300
" as you listen to the administration, it's impossible for obamacare to fail because every time they don't hit some number that they've been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success as whatever's already happened. %$* 300
so, for example, just a few months ago, kathleen sebelius, who's the secretary of health and human services, was saying that success in the exchanges was seven million people signed up by march 2014. and then they had a few problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn't having seven million people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool-- %$* 300
in the insurance pools on the exchanges. %$* 300
then they said that we got-- %$* 300
needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults, which is between the ages of 18 and 35.and then we got some data on the demographics. %$* 300
and so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who've signed up are young adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a few reasons that should be fairly obvious, could make insurance cost a lot more than we were hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would be signing up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right, of however many people you've signed up is the number that was possible. %$* 300
it's the self- licking ice cream cone of policy programs. %$* 300
but for the rest of us, i don't think it's enough for obamacare to merely exist. %$* 300
it has to actually do something and do something that we want. %$* 300
so what did we want? %$* 300
what were we promised? %$* 300
we were promised lower costs for government and individuals, and we've heard some of that. %$* 300
the administration likes to claim that this has already happened. %$* 300
this hasn't. %$* 300
health care cost growth has indeed slowed, but health care cost growth started slowing in 2004 when barack obama was a junior state senator from illinois. %$* 300
he had not even been elected to the u.s.senate, much less to the presidency. %$* 300
you see a big decline in 2005 to 2007-- %$* 300
in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in 2010 right when obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if you look at the oecd figures on that. %$* 300
kaiser projects-- %$* 300
you remember we heard that the average family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums? %$* 300
that didn't happen. %$* 300
kaiser is now projecting that premiums will go up. %$* 300
we wanted people to get healthier as a result of this law, but then we got the oregon medicaid study, which is the gold standard in studies of medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to look at, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and it showed no statistically significant results. %$* 300
more than half of the expansion in obamacare comes through medicaid. %$* 300
we wanted people with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexisting conditions we were told were out there to be able to buy insurance. %$* 300
but when they set up pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting to get 400,000 people between 2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number, and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing an aggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up. %$* 300
and we wanted expanded health care coverage, right? %$* 300
but at this point, we can't even say that there are more people insured right now than there were on january 15, 2013. we-- %$* 300
the administration says that there have been four million people added to medicaid, but half of those people came in states that didn't even do the medicaid expansion. %$* 300
so definitionally they were already eligible for medicaid. %$* 300
of the other states, some of those people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage. %$* 300
the administration can't even say that these are people who are getting new coverage. %$* 300
some of them may just be going back on to medicaid just like they were last year. %$* 300
we have 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policies cancelled. %$* 300
no one, i think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn't even know whether we've increased the insurance numbers and the administration refuses to certify that that is actually happening. %$* 300
meanwhile, we were not supposed to hurt anyone who had insurance, right? %$* 300
if you liked your plan and you liked your doctor, you could keep them. %$* 300
we all know that that has not happened, so five million people have had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeing that their doctors are not-- %$* 300
the best hospitals and doctors in their area have been kicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges. %$* 300
so, it was also supposed to be really popular, , right? %$* 300
because we had all of this great stuff, this giant rube goldberg apparatus layered on top. %$* 300
we didn't take anything away, we only gave. %$* 300
and it's kind of time for a dr. %$* 300
phil moment, how is that working for you? %$* 300
nothing is working the way the administration said. %$* 300
so you can say it does not really matter whether it is unpopular, right? %$* 300
the point is not to be popular, and yes, some people have gotten hurt, but you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, right? %$* 300
it was never reasonable to think that everyone was going to get to keep the doctors and the plans that they wanted. %$* 300
something had to change and this is a foundation for something better. %$* 300
but this foundation has so many cracks you cannot build a healthy structure on top of it. %$* 300
just look at everything the administration has had to do in the last few months just to keep the law running. %$* 300
they had to delay the employer mandate and the enforcement, apparently because they couldn’t even figure out how to make this regulation work. %$* 300
it may never go into effect, which means we'll lose millions of people who were supposed to get coverage expanded through and the cost will go up to the government. %$* 300
they delayed the spanish language website, and now apparently part of it is written in spanglish. %$* 300
despite the fact that hispanics are a major constituency for insurance expansion. %$* 300
they delayed the small business exchanges. %$* 300
they've allowed people to keep plans that were supposed to be illegal because they weren't real insurance kathleen sebelius told us. %$* 300
they've delayed deadlines over and over again. %$* 300
they've done all these things by asserting emergency powers by doing administrative fixes through executive fiat, and yeah fair enough, obamacare is certainly an emergency, but all of these changes have had the effect of undermining and destabilizing the law that they think is so important. %$* 300
they’ve had to do these things even though they know it makes the insurance pools less actuarily sound, because they can't face the political backlash. %$* 300
and what happens when republicans get into office and i assume they, too, think obamacare is an emergency and could be fixed with some executive orders. %$* 300
essentially they've made it so that republicans can undo two-thirds of this law with a stroke of the presidential pen. %$* 300
obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 300
the administration has destroyed their own law in order to save it. %$* 300
thank you. %$* 300
megan mcardle. %$* 13
and that is our motion: obamacare is now beyond rescue. %$* 13
and now to speak against this motion coming to the lectern is jonathan chait. %$* 13
he is a daily columnist for new york magazine. %$* 13
he's author of the book, "the big con: crackpot economics and the fleecing of america." ladies and gentlemen, jonathan chait. %$* 13
has anybody here ever renovated a house? %$* 301
i've done it twice. %$* 301
it was hell. %$* 301
every day i went through brought fresh misery and fresh reason to think why am i doing this, but in the end it worked, and the reason it worked is because we know how to renovate houses, right? %$* 301
so when you hear about the problems that our opponents are describing in the law, they had to delay this, they had to fix this, the spanish language website didn't work as well as they wanted the first day. %$* 301
you have to ask, are these things that are going to fundamentally destroy the law or are they the kind of problems you have in a renovation? %$* 301
they said, oh, we didn't quite get the counters we want. %$* 301
oh, this went a little bit over cost. %$* 301
well, then you have to ask-- %$* 301
to answer that question you have to ask what kind of endeavor is obamacare? %$* 301
is the obama administration trying to build a moon base? %$* 301
is the obama administration trying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile muslim country? %$* 301
no. %$* 301
what they're trying to do is build a national health insurance plan. %$* 301
can you build a national health insurance plan? %$* 301
well, every advanced economy in the world, except the united states, has built a national health insurance plan. %$* 301
all of those countries insure all their citizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the united states. %$* 301
so you’re a priori assumption has to be yeah, this is something you can basically do that the problems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself, but the problems you have any time you go through any major project. %$* 301
so, what our opponents have been trying to do for months, and months, and months, actually is paint this picture where every time the contractor comes to you and says, "oh, it turns out they don't have this color, oh, it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day," it means the whole thing is going to collapse on its own. %$* 301
but actually, nothing like that is happening at all. %$* 301
and there is no evidence that anything like this is happening. %$* 301
the main argument that the opponents have been making the entire time is that there is going to be a death spiral. %$* 301
that's the only plausible mechanism that they have, that the law will fail. %$* 301
a death spiral is a term that i expected them to talk about, because that's what they've been talking about for months. %$* 301
it's something they've barely invoked at all. %$* 301
and i think the reason is it's become clear, in recent days, that there's no chance of a death spiral in the obamacare law. %$* 301
a death spiral is when you have too many old, sick people who drive up the cost, making the premiums more expensive, leading the healthy people to flee, driving up costs more. %$* 301
that is theoretically possible, but is not something that can possibly happen in this law. %$* 301
in fact, if you want to say, "is the law succeeding? %$* 301
" you don't have to ask the administration. %$* 301
you could ask the insurers, right? %$* 301
because the insurers have recently been saying they're very happy with the mix of people-- %$* 301
the mix of people you have in the exchanges is sound. %$* 301
it's sustainable. %$* 301
they don't need-- %$* 301
they don't need it to change. %$* 301
they've got a mix of people that's healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward. %$* 301
what's more, even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than they expect, you had-- %$* 301
the kaiser health foundation ran the numbers and said, "what's the worst-case scenario? %$* 301
" we don't get any increase in young people at all. %$* 301
and they said it would be about a 2.4 percent increase in premiums 2.4 percent increase in health insurance premiums. %$* 301
if any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a 2.4 percent increase over your bill last year, you'd say, "thank god it's only a 2.4 percent increase," right? %$* 301
that's a rounding error. %$* 301
no one notices 2.4 percent. %$* 301
that couldn't possibly set off a death spiral. %$* 301
so there's really no plausible mechanism that the law could fail. %$* 301
so i think what they're giving you-- %$* 301
instead of what used to be the plausible mechanism for which the-- %$* 301
this can fail, they're giving you a mix of wishes and hopes and completely debunked facts. %$* 301
they said, "cost growth leveled after 2010.” no. %$* 301
cost growth in 2012 was lower than at any year in 50 years. %$* 301
and in fact-- %$* 301
this is important because when the law was passed, cost growth was the main thing they talked about. %$* 301
obamacare was supposed to control costs. %$* 301
and they said, "no, no, it's going to make costs explode with all this bureaucracy regulation. %$* 301
they're going to go out of control.” what happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimistic estimates believed it would be before the law was signed. %$* 301
and so now, they're reduced-- %$* 301
instead of saying, "this disaster of cost growth is going to happen," they're going to say, "this incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence.” so, all they're saying is essentially that this wonderful thing that's happened has nothing to do with the gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to the lowest level in 50 years. %$* 301
and you can't prove that it's not a coincidence. %$* 301
but you have to-- %$* 301
see, this is indicative of the mentality we're dealing with, where it simply moves from one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario. %$* 301
so you have to wonder, "why are they simple moving from one disaster scenario to another disaster scenario? %$* 301
"actually, i wanted to debunk a couple points they made, because a lot of this is just-- %$* 301
we've heard from the other side-- %$* 301
are not true. %$* 301
i can't give you links and charts to debunk them, but let me say that it's not the case that 5 million policies have been canceled. %$* 301
that's a number that was floating about that you can't verify. %$* 301
it's almost certainly not true. %$* 301
many journalists have tried to figure out exactly how many policies have been canceled. %$* 301
and they don't have good enough records to know, but they know it's not 5 million. %$* 301
and they suspect-- %$* 301
the administration suspects it's closer to one-tenth of that figure. %$* 301
they can't actually prove that either, but for various reasons, you don't have a good enough count. %$* 301
this-- %$* 301
that's almost certainly nowhere close to 5 million. %$* 301
and that's a big number that's-- %$* 301
they're citing because they're saying, that-- %$* 301
those are the losers. %$* 301
but it's really nowhere close to that. %$* 301
yet they say-- %$* 301
megan said we can't-- %$* 301
we can't say for sure how many-- %$* 301
how-- %$* 301
that there are more insured now than there were before. %$* 301
we can't say for sure, because again, this number can't exactly be counted. %$* 301
we don't know that 400,000-- %$* 301
it was 500,000.but we know it's not anywhere close to 5 million. %$* 301
and it's a mortal certainty that far more people have health insurance now than would have had in absence of the law. %$* 301
so why are we having this kind of lurch, from one argument, abandoning these arguments when they disappear, and simply coming up with new ones? %$* 301
the truth is, they disagree with the goals of the law. %$* 301
and i think you could hear that in their remarks. %$* 301
they say, "there's less choice.” and it's true. %$* 301
the government says insurers have to provide certain benefits right. %$* 301
they have to provide pregnancy coverage. %$* 301
that's-- %$* 301
and maternity care. %$* 301
those are the most controversial things that are mostly cited, because they want people who are male or old to not have to pay for those things. %$* 301
and they want people who are young and female and might have to bear children to pay those costs themselves, because that's an ideological difference between the two sides. %$* 301
and that's fine for them to have an ideological difference between the two sides. %$* 301
but we're not here to debate whether this law is a good idea. %$* 301
we're here to debate whether the law is actually working, and the truth is the only reason they're desperately trying to claim the law is not working is because they oppose national health insurance. %$* 301
thank you, jonathan chait. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is "obamacare is now beyond rescue." and now we go on to round two, and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you and our live audience. %$* 13
now, i want to remind you that tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org, and on fora .tv, and if you're watching this live stream right now, we would like to hear from you. %$* 13
send us your questions on twitter or facebook with hashtag obamacare so that we don't miss it. %$* 13
be sure to include your city, state, and first name. %$* 13
and if you're going to do that, what we really request from you is not a statement or an assertion of your views, but really a question that moves these debaters along on the motion, the specific motion of whether obamacare is beyond rescue. %$* 13
try not to be ideological. %$* 13
try to be provocative. %$* 13
so on into round two, and round two, as i said, is where the debaters address each other directly. %$* 13
the motion is "obamacare is now beyond rescue." we have two teams arguing for and against that. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, scott gottlieb and megan mcardle, have argued-- %$* 13
in a sense, they are arguing that the law from its beginnings has always been beyond rescue, that it reduces competition, it reduces choice, it pushes people into medicaid, a system which does not have good medical outcomes, or at least not the kind of medical outcomes that people would aspire to for it. %$* 13
and they've described the law as a rube goldberg kind of apparatus and that the administration only gets away with calling it "successful" in any way by continuously moving the goalposts. %$* 13
team arguing against the motion, dr. %$* 13
douglas kamerow and jonathan chait, say, "yeah, the law is not perfect," but they're arguing that it's working in real ways already, that there are more people insured now than there were three years ago in the united states, that standards are being forced, and that-- %$* 13
in general, that we've come a long way. %$* 13
and they also argue that the terms of the basic law, the aspirations of the law, that lots of countries do it, and that, in fact, it does work. %$* 13
they argue that the opposition from their opponents is more ideological, that they just don't actually want the law to succeed, a question i'd actually like to put to the side arguing for the motion. %$* 13
is that the case? %$* 13
would you-- %$* 13
in an ideal world, would obamacare succeed or would you hate that? %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
well, look, i-- %$* 295
look, in a wealthy country, i think we need to address issues of people who are priced out of the market, people who have preexisting conditions and can't find coverage. %$* 295
i think there were far more efficient ways to do that. %$* 295
you could've given people incentives to get insured and stay insured, and it would have required that you subsidize certain people to get into the marketplace and subsidize them through transitions in life where they might otherwise not have the income and lose coverage. %$* 295
there's nothing inherently wrong with pooling people based on what state they live in, for example, if that's the point, if this is copying mitt romney's plan. %$* 295
what's inherently wrong with this law is the way that the law tries to prescribe a uniform federal standard for what needs to be in everyone's insurance policy. %$* 295
and so these decisions get made in a political context, and you end up with policies that are exceedingly expensive, laden down with mandates that don't meet what consumers want. %$* 295
and then you tell insurers they can't underwrite risk, they can't use cost sharing as a tool to steer people to certain benefits or others, they can't change the benefit design, and so they're forced to do one thing which is to narrow the networks of providers that people have access to and to skinny down the drug formularies, which is exactly what we've done in medicaid. %$* 295
scott, to the point of the motion and granting all of that, are you saying that, therefore, the law cannot work, that it's doomed to collapse in on itself-- %$* 13
it’s the structure that's inherently flawed. %$* 295
scott, can i ask a question? %$* 302
scott, you're saying-- %$* 302
you're describing what you would have liked, but let's be real-- %$* 302
let's be realistic: if the choice is we have obamacare now, it's a law, what are the chances of any kind of scenario that you're describing taking-- %$* 302
taking flight, passing both houses of congress at any time in the foreseeable future? %$* 302
i think that the problem is that the people in washington-- %$* 295
progressives in washington can't resist the temptation to tinker with every aspect of what the provisions are, and you end up with regulations that prescribe exactly what people have to have and don't have to have. %$* 295
surgical sterilization is in. %$* 295
certain things are out. %$* 295
you have a law that gets laden down with mandates and it ends up being-- %$* 295
exceeding expensive to provide this coverage to everyone, they have to do it, the insurers have to go after the network, exactly what we've done in medicaid. %$* 295
we've promised a very rich set of benefits on paper in medicaid. %$* 295
it looks like a fabulous program, but we know medicaid recipients can't get access to the care. %$* 295
i don't think it's being done politically because it-- %$* 295
these decisions now are being made in washington. %$* 295
jonathan chait, do you want to respond? %$* 13
megan, answer the question %$* 301
yeah, megan? %$* 13
oh, well, i would say that i certainly agree with jonathan chait, that this is going much, much, much worse than i thought, and there are all sorts of problems that i didn't anticipate. %$* 300

well, yeah. %$* 562
there's a whole lot of-- %$* 562
i mean, at what size does my farm get too big to be moral? %$* 562
i mean, what size farm is immoral? %$* 562
when do i become industrial? %$* 562
confined animal feeding operations. %$* 19
i think it's useful to point out that if we're talking about the chickens being indoors or outdoors, the reason we get flu every year is from asia where most of the chickens and ducks are still kept outdoors and they are wandering up and down the street of the village, and it is the interaction between humans-- %$* 564
but that's in asia. %$* 58
and those animals that we get the asian flu. %$* 564
we get cholera from hogs. %$* 564
we had-- %$* 564
this is historic. %$* 564
most of our epidemic diseases have come about through this close interaction of people and animals, and modern confinement production is protecting you from those diseases. %$* 564
okay, urvashi, so we're talking about-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 561
i'm sorry, dennis, that is just garbage. %$* 561
that is not the case. %$* 561
so you-- %$* 564
i'm sorry. %$* 561
confined animal feeding operations-- %$* 561
i don't know if anybody's heard about lagoon pits of poo the size of a great lake that exists, and these are bacterial cesspools for lots of viruses. %$* 561
the h1n1 was a mixture of bird, pig, maybe something else. %$* 561
we have huge hog farms in north carolina. %$* 561
we have huge problems with bacterial problems down there from the poo pits. %$* 561
this doesn't just come from china. %$* 561
we've got the problem right here with industrialized agriculture in this country. %$* 561
gentleman with the beard. %$* 13
hello. %$* 18
could you stand up, please? %$* 13
sure, hi. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
hurst, you really caught my attention when you said that organic agriculture should stop aligning itself with celebrity actresses and start talking to farmers. %$* 18
michael jackson, ray charles, brittany spears, beyonce, christina aguilera-- %$* 18
all right, all right, i need a question. %$* 13
mariah carey-- %$* 18
my question to you is, should we really be thinking twice and flipping the question around to say, is chemical food marketing hype? %$* 18
those names i read by the way to give you some context are pepsi spokespersons that i have seen on television in my lifetime. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
and pepsi is made from corn. %$* 18
was there a question? %$* 562
yes. %$* 18
well, his question was, is conventional farming marketing hype, and given that actually your team has claimed a superiority in several areas for conventional farming, i think it's a fair question. %$* 13
okay, yeah. %$* 562
well, then, of course, the answer would be no. %$* 562
i love a pithy answer. %$* 13
white shirt? %$* 13
right behind you. %$* 13
this is our last question. %$* 13
the part of the marketing that i'm interested-- %$* 13
can you stand up, please? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
the part of the marketing that i'm interested in hearing about is the health oriented marketing that could be either viewed as hype from the one side or not from the other. %$* 18
and what i had a hard time following was the notion that on the one side that defended organic food, organic farming, there was a listing of 80 scientific papers that proved the health benefits of organically produced food. %$* 18
and on the other side there was a lack of trust in the scientific data. %$* 18
so i was hoping that we could actually talk just briefly about one, just pick one of the 80 that says there's no doubt that there are health-related benefits to organic food, and then just ask the other side why that's not accurate. %$* 18
sure. %$* 58
the "british journal of medicine" published a study about two years ago that showed that children born to mothers who consume predominantly organic milk and meat during pregnancy with its elevated levels of conjugated linoleic acids, which are a heart healthy fat, had lower-- %$* 58
the children had lower levels of eczema. %$* 58
it was really the first time an actual health benefit in humans from consuming organic food has been proven and published in a peer review journal. %$* 58
and, of course, this is for any health problem. %$* 58
so many different things affect health. %$* 58
it's very unusual to be able to trace a disease or-- %$* 58
to a single part of our lifestyle. %$* 58
so that's one study that came out, and it hasn't been refuted. %$* 58
all right. %$* 13
let's hear the other side respond. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 560
did you say that was the first that's come out after 80 years? %$* 564
no, no. %$* 13
he said it's one that's come out. %$* 13
a study proving a health benefit in humans, when i said before that there're 80 studies, those are studies comparing the nutrient levels in organic food to conventional food. %$* 58
now, there're a lot of people that feel eating more nutrients really doesn't make you any healthier, but you got to wonder why the u.s. government is spending so much time and energy trying to get us to eat more fruits and vegetables. %$* 58
john krebs. %$* 13
well it’s very simple. %$* 560
in that study as in many others, it’s very difficult to tease apart the contribution of different factors. %$* 560
there’s no clear proof in that study that the benefits that chuck has alluded to were to do with eating organic foods, because there are a lot of other differences between the comparison population. %$* 560
so we still don’t have any evidence that organic food is healthier food for you. %$* 560
and that concludes round two of this debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each and it’s their last chance to change your minds and from the audience vote before hand, we know where you stood for before the debate began. %$* 13
here’s what we have. %$* 13
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype.” before the debate, 21 percent of you were for this motion, 45 percent were against and 34 percent were undecided and we’ll ask you to vote again shortly and we’ll ask you in that way to pick our winner as this debate concludes just a few minute from now. %$* 13
but now onto round three, closing statements from each team in turn. %$* 13
speaking first against the motion, organic food is marketing hype, charles benbrook, chief scientist at the organic center. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 58
as i said before, this is about the claims or the positive attributes that are used in labeling and advertising, educational material on websites to convince consumers to buy more organic food. %$* 58
that’s what we’re talking about. %$* 58
the claim that is most common and most known to americans is about the reduction, significant reduction in pesticide use and risk that’s associated with organic farming; that’s kind of a no- brainer. %$* 58
organic farmers don’t apply any of the dangerous pesticides that we have a huge program in the epa to deal with. %$* 58
and they don’t use any of the pesticides that are causing all the problems with bees. %$* 58
they don’t use any of the herbicides that are castrating male frogs and feminizing them all throughout the midwest. %$* 58
they just don’t use them at all; it’s prohibitive. %$* 58
and that prohibition is embodied in the regulations. %$* 58
in terms of animal drugs and in particular, antibiotics and growth promoting hormones, hormones that push animals to produce more quickly, organic farmers can’t use them. %$* 58
it’s against the rules and that’s again, embodied in the standards. %$* 58
so when a company promotes organic food as better for animals, this is one of the reasons. %$* 58
the other claim that is ubiquitous is that organic farming is better for the environment. %$* 58
the u.s.department of agriculture has agreed with us. %$* 58
organic farmers build soil; they add humus to the soil; they reduce greenhouse gasses; they reduce the loss of nitrogen into the groundwater. %$* 58
they promote bio-diversity; they don’t kill bees; they don’t kill frogs; they don’t kill beneficial insects. %$* 58
and again this suite of benefits are embodied in binding, enforceable regulations that a part of the rules. %$* 58
so please don’t buy into the arguments of the other side that because organic farming can’t feed the world and all these other claims, that you should vote for this motion. %$* 58
thank you, charles benbrook. %$* 13
our motion is organic food is marketing hype and summarizing his position for the motion, john krebs, principal of jesus college, oxford and former chairman of the u.k.’s food standards agency. %$* 13
i just want to make two points very briefly. %$* 560
first of all, we haven’t really discussed what is organic food? %$* 560
when i was head of the food standards agency, i asked to meet with the organic food sector. %$* 560
ten people turned up and i said okay, i just want to talk to one of you. %$* 560
it turned out there were 10 different certification bodies for organic food in the u.k.and they all disagree with one another. %$* 560
no one body would allow the others to represent their view because they didn’t agree on what organic food was. %$* 560
so it’s one thing to say that there are standards that are followed, but those standards are completely different depending on who you talk to. %$* 560
so we should be clear that organic food means different things to different people. %$* 560
and let’s go back over these questions about marketing hype, because whether or not their explicit claims might be made by the organic producers and organic marketers, they are certainly claims that people who buy organic food believe and accept. %$* 560
and those claims are either that it’s better for you or its better for the environment. %$* 560
we’ve heard nothing this evening that really provides me with convincing evidence of either of those claims. %$* 560
okay you may get more bio-diversity on an organic farm, but if we’re going to feed people with organic food, we need to turn more land into agriculture and do away with our natural parks and wildlife reserves. %$* 560
is that tradeoff worth making? %$* 560
i don't know, but we haven't heard any evidence for it this evening. %$* 560
do pesticides pose a risk? %$* 560
well, remember that organic farmers use insecticides, including one called rotinone which is known to cause cancer in rats, is one of the most dangerous pesticides if you're worried about carcinogens in your food. %$* 560
so if you're worried about pesticide risk, don't eat organic food, don't eat conventional food. %$* 560
in fact, starve to death. %$* 560
thank you. %$* 560
thank you, john krebs. %$* 13
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype.” we're in the closing statement section. %$* 13
and speaking against the motion, jeffrey steingarten: best-selling author and food critic for vogue magazine. %$* 13
first of all, i assume that one of my debate partners, team partners, will be able to refute the one example given of a danger of something that's used in organic food. %$* 563
there may be a lot of people in america who disagree about what organic food should mean. %$* 563
but we have a law. %$* 563
it's very hard to read it, and it's long. %$* 563
and it's very exacting. %$* 563
there have been issues about whether it's enforced strongly enough. %$* 563
but that would mean we shouldn't have speed limits because some people that i know exceed them. %$* 563
there's no doubt about the environmental dangers of conventional agriculture. %$* 563
you may have read that in the gulf of mexico there is a dead zone, and it changes in size every year. %$* 563
it appears to come from all the nitrogen that is dumped into the mississippi river for a thousand, 2,000 miles all the way from chicago. %$* 563
and it gets into the gulf of mexico, and it deprives plants and fish of oxygen. %$* 563
the size of the dead zone two years ago was about the size of new jersey in the middle of the gulf of mexico. %$* 563
there is no doubt to me that conventional agriculture is doomed. %$* 563
the only question is how soon. %$* 563
there is-- %$* 563
conventional agriculture requires lots of water, an even, steady climate, a monoculture and none these conditions-- %$* 563
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is “organic food is marketing hype.” and summarizing his position in support of this motion, blake hurst, a farmer and vice president of the missouri farm bureau. %$* 13
the longest term study and the go-to reference, if you look up organic yields, was done at the institute. %$* 562
they had two organic plots, one which used manure as a fertilizer source. %$* 562
we don't have enough manure to fertilize all the acres that are in crops today. %$* 562
we would need 5 billion-- %$* 562
5 billion more cows in order to produce enough manure to use that much fertilizer. %$* 562
the other crop used a long rotation of using legumes and corn two years out of five, where legumes, in order to produce the nitrogen for the corn or the cash crop the next year. %$* 562
so there you have it. %$* 562
that's the final point. %$* 562
organic food in any given year can produce the same as conventional food. %$* 562
but over that five- year period, it only produced 60 percent as much. %$* 562
60 percent as much. %$* 562
two years ago, we were at a 30-year low in food stocks and cereal grain stocks. %$* 562
countries were banning the export of rice even here in the u.s.they limited the amount of rice you could buy because of the short supply. %$* 562
they were trying to cut down on hoarding. %$* 562
we can have food problems. %$* 562
we can't solve them. %$* 562
we can't have hunger problems. %$* 562
we can't solve them with organic production. %$* 562
we americans take a plentiful supply of food for granted. %$* 562
and we've forgotten that the history of the world is a long search for food security. %$* 562
we have to remember that the history of agriculture is not a long crime, not a sort of industrial fall from grace, but rather the greatest success story the world has ever seen. %$* 562
the advances in farming and the application of technology to production of food have made us better fed, safer, healthier and richer. %$* 562
those are very good things, and we should give thanks for our good fortune. %$* 562
and that's why you should vote in favor of this motion. %$* 562
thank you, blake hurst. %$* 13
our motion is "organic food is marketing hype." and summarizing her position against the motion is urvashi rangan who is director of technical policy for the consumers union. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 561
our opponents have just been off topic this entire evening, and the resolution is not about yield and how much organic yields versus conventional. %$* 561
does it yield more or less? %$* 561
it's not about whether organic feeds the world or not. %$* 561
that's not the resolution. %$* 561
the resolution is whether it's marketing hype. %$* 561
john on the other side, brought up, it doesn't offer health benefits. %$* 561
it doesn't, so therefore it's marketing hype. %$* 561
it was never designed to be a healthier food product for you, the human being. %$* 561
it turns out there are some inadvertent benefits about being healthier to the environment. %$* 561
and that's what it was designed for. %$* 561
and it turns out when we're better to the environment, and we're better to the animals that we raise, and we don't soak these animals and the ground they're on with drugs and chemicals and heavy metals, it turns out that might be better for us too. %$* 561
and that is in fact why organic is not marketing hype. %$* 561
it began as something that was positive for the earth. %$* 561
and my opponents did not refute not a single of my first three points in terms of poop being fed to animals. %$* 561
john, the u.k.closed up all the loopholes with animal feed with mad cow. %$* 561
we didn't do that. %$* 561
and so organic offers that tangible benefit. %$* 561
we mitigate those exposures in organic food production. %$* 561
secondly, with antibiotics, we have a big problem with the resistance of bacteria at antibiotics. %$* 561
our opponents had no response whatsoever to that point. %$* 561
there is a tangible danger associated with conventional production. %$* 561
and we feed animals heavy metals. %$* 561
just today, the inspector general of the usda came out with a report showing residues of heavy metals, chemicals and drugs in meat. %$* 561
it's there. %$* 561
it's in the meat. %$* 561
organic doesn't use those things. %$* 561
and therefore, organic is not marketing hype. %$* 561
we urge you to vote against this resolution. %$* 561
thank you, urvashi rangan. %$* 13
our motion is "organic food is marketing hype." and summarizing his support for the motion, dennis avery, director of the hudson institute, center for global food issues. %$* 13
bruce ames, university of california berkeley, one of the most knowledgeable cancer researchers in the world, tested pesticides, tested first synthetic pesticides and found about half of them caused cancer in rats at high doses. %$* 564
he was applauded by the organic movement. %$* 564
then he started testing natural compounds and whether they caused rat-- %$* 564
cancer in rats at high doses. %$* 564
and about half of them did. %$* 564
and this is where dr. %$* 564
krebs got his point about the 46 carcinogens in the coffee. %$* 564
and the actual reality is that 99.99 percent of the carcinogens that you ingest are from mother nature. %$* 564
they're there mostly in the plant foods that we eat and consume and brew. %$* 564
and there if you're eating organic food at all this additional expense, you might be reducing your exposure to cancer by something on the order of 1/10,000 of 1 percent. %$* 564
i was a little surprised to find that we were also here tonight to discuss the pig poo in the waters of the state of north carolina. %$* 564
but since i have in fact analyzed the data on that particular question, i can tell you that there has been no change in the water quality in north carolina since they started growing hogs down there. %$* 564
there is a problem with the water quality below the cities because the sewage treatment plants don't deal adequately with the people poo. %$* 564
dennis avery, your time is up. %$* 13
not the pig. %$* 564
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we are asking you in the audience to choose our winner. %$* 13
we're asking you to go to the keypad, to the right of each seat. %$* 13

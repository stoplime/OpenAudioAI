that is clean energy, the fundamental question here-- %$* 554
clean energy adds nothing to the economy. %$* 554
it is only a substitution for existing electricity. %$* 554
do i care-- %$* 554
these lights. %$* 554
i like electricity. %$* 554
but if this wind-- %$* 554
if this electricity is coming from a wind turbine or a solar panel and it costs twice as much as the electricity i might get from a coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plant, where is the benefit to me? %$* 554
i’ll gladly pay for a nicer tie or nicer-- %$* 554
let’s let kassia yanosek answer that question. %$* 13
if clean energy is more expensive than conventional energy, then how does that help the economy? %$* 13
well, actually, i think you’re wrong on that point. %$* 553
i mean, if you look at the numbers, and i know you’ve got the numbers because you said clearly you have all the numbers. %$* 553
they are important. %$* 554
you know, the iea, for example, has done a study of the amount of subsidies that go for the fossil fuel generation globally. %$* 553
i believe that number last year was 312 billion. %$* 553
for renewables, it was about 37 billion. %$* 553
so we’re not really comparing apples to apples here. %$* 553
so i’ll just start with that. %$* 553
but secondly, i want to clear up this point about what-- %$* 553
wait, i’m not satisfied with your answer to his point. %$* 13
it wasn’t detailed enough for me. %$* 13
the notion that-- %$* 13
and i think most of us have that sense that energy provided through alternative-- %$* 13
what we would call renewable alternative means costs more now and will for the long future. %$* 13
and that that doesn’t sound like a way to lift off. %$* 13
let bill ritter-- %$* 13
i think your-- %$* 13
in colorado, coal, without any price on carbon, is six cents a kilowatt hour. %$* 551
wind is about nine. %$* 551
coal can get to 6.5.wind is at nine. %$* 551
and when i became governor, solar was 40 percent more than it is now. %$* 551
in a four-year period, solar came down 40 percent. %$* 551
still not competitive with wind if you just say apples to apples, but this is the kind of argument that you hear from you guys. %$* 551
and i’m thinking here about the flat screen tv. it was $15,000 a tv four years ago, and now it’s $350. %$* 551
so we give up on flat screen tvs because they cost way too much. %$* 551
this is something that’s happened and as, i think, kassia said, this is happening around the world, that people are looking for clean energy alternatives. %$* 551
you’ve got wind without a price on carbon very close to coal. %$* 551
you’ve got solar coming down 40 percent, and it is our-- %$* 551
incumbent upon us to be innovators and-- %$* 551
okay. %$* 13
so your argument is through innovation the prices are going to get lower. %$* 13
and i want to take that back to robert bryce. %$* 13
well, let me just address the subsidy question. %$* 554
the effective subsidy for wind now is two cents per kilowatt hour. %$* 554
but let’s compare apples to apples and take it to per million btu cost. %$* 554
that is an effective subside of $6.44 per million btu of energy created by the wind industry. %$* 554
the market price, the market price for natural gas today is under $4. %$* 554
you’re talking about now, but your opponents are talking about future in which the price will get lower through innovation. %$* 13
that’s the point of the flat screen tvs. %$* 13
okay, fair enough. %$* 554
i want a flat screen tv.we have flat screen tvs in our house. %$* 554
i don’t want a wind turbine next to my house. %$* 554
the demand for-- %$* 554
but, again, robert, that’s not the point. %$* 13
okay, why not %$* 554
the point is the price of the energy. %$* 13
oh, come on, but it was a good one, yeah, %$* 554
not the noise of the wind turbine engine. %$* 13
talking about the history of energy innovation and technology development, and if you look back through the history of how these costs came down the cost curve because it was not always that easy and that cheap to drill for oil and natural gas. %$* 553
governments had to be involved; these industries had to be helped along with industry. %$* 553
well, but how long do we need to help them? %$* 554
in the carter administration we heard that solar energy was going to be the dominant form of energy by the year 2000. what happened? %$* 554
the problem here is not about subsidies, it’s not-- %$* 554
it’s not even about want to or belief in global warming, it’s basic physics and math. %$* 554
i sound a little wonky here, it’s all about power density. %$* 554
how much power can you harness from a given area, or volume, or mass, and that’s where solar and wind just fall down. %$* 554
we’re talking about one watt per square meter for a wind turbine, for an-- %$* 554
even a marginal natural gas, well, we’re talking about 20 or more watts per square meter. %$* 554
this is basic physics. %$* 554
it’s not about want to or government policy. %$* 554
the reason these energy sources have not been able to get off of subsidies is that they’re fighting uphill in terms of physics. %$* 554
i think he’s saying the price can’t go down because of the physics of it, because of the space, because of the intensity. %$* 13
no, no, i think that-- %$* 13
seriously, i think that’s your argument and i-- %$* 13
because what does it take to-- %$* 13
these enormous solar farms take enormous amounts of investment in land and you’re saying that it’s going to be a long, long time before it ever pays for itself, so i want to take that back to bill ritter because you have experience in this area. %$* 13
well, again-- %$* 551
so, here, we develop wind farms, we develop them from start to finish in the state of colorado. %$* 551
we've got a fellow that’s got 112 turbines on his land, he’s making about $5,000 per turbine, so it’s a half a million dollars that he’s earning in income and he’s got 68 acres out of production, 68 acres, he’s still able to farm, this is-- %$* 551
he’s a wheat farmer, still able to farm all of that. %$* 551
and time, after time, after time not only have we seen the ability to put up a wind farm but we’ve seen the economic development possibilities for rural colorado in an industry that, quite frankly, sort of lives at the margin. %$* 551
think about the mohave desert right now where they’re building out solar and they’re doing concentrated solar power with natural gas, and this is why i don’t accept that we have this either/or. %$* 551
it’s this false choice. %$* 551
the folks at bright source have 2.6 gigawatts of purchase power agreements with southern california, and so they’re going to build out these solar towers, and they’re going to put natural gas turbines on there, and if you look at the emissions, back to thinking about it in terms of emissions, if the sun shines like it’s supposed to in the desert, and the rest of it’s natural gas, they get 24-hour power, but they reduce emissions 75 percent in that 2.6 gigawatts of power going into southern california. %$* 551
steven hayward. %$* 13
well, this raises an interesting point about how there is no form of energy that doesn’t have some kind of environmental tradeoff except maybe for that bicycle generator the professor made for gilligan. %$* 552
so environmentalists are-- %$* 552
have a whole bevy of lawsuits against those solar power projects right now in california because they’re built on the habitat of the desert tortoise and other endangered species, and there are separate lawsuits to block the very long transmission lines you have to build to bring them into southern california. %$* 552
at last count there are 70 wind projects around the country that are facing environmental lawsuits to stop them for various impacts. %$* 552
you know, we get upset when birds die from a spill in the gulf of mexico, okay, fine. %$* 552
windmills kill about 10,000 birds a year, and they also kill a lot of bats. %$* 552
and, you know, bats, as you know, have sonar. %$* 552
do you know how wind-- %$* 552
and they don’t run into the blades like birds do. %$* 552
do you know how they kill the bats? %$* 552
air pressure changes by the blades explodes their lungs, so there’s no form of energy itself, the point is, is that not only have we heard that fossil fuels are clean, but so-called clean energy sources have their own environmental defects, and i’m still waiting for a coherent definition for clean for you that doesn’t conveniently feed into whatever it is you guys like. %$* 552
kassia yanosek. %$* 13
well, first of all, i’m a fan of frogs, but not of bats, so i’m not actually going to take that argument on. %$* 553
what about birds? %$* 554
how do you feel about birds? %$* 554
but, again, i'm a frog person, so i'm just going to %$* 553
i'm a bird person. %$* 554
but i want to go back to this, you know, definition of clean energy and the cost issue because there's something that we have not really been able to focus on tonight and that is the actual reason we're here, to talk about growing the economy and if clean energy can actually get us out of this economic challenging environment that we're in. %$* 553
so first of all we talked about our view of what defines clean energy, it's about more efficient, cleaner energy in terms of less emissions, it's about not just talking about wind and solar here, but innovations that go beyond wind and solar. %$* 553
it's about cleaner fossil fuels. %$* 553
it's about innovations we haven't seen yet. %$* 553
it's about energy storage and all the ancillary investments and innovations that need to go on to building and creating a new energy economy. %$* 553
and then, going back to the cost issue, i think we've made some very big points tonight, about how the costs are coming down the curve. %$* 553
and we need to be spending our time, and money, and efforts right now building an innovation economy. %$* 553
because not only do we need to do that domestically, but we need to, we need an investment strategy for how we're going to be building our export economy. %$* 553
kassia, where are the jobs in what you're talking about? %$* 13
the jobs are all over the place. %$* 553
they're everywhere, from investment houses, research firms, there are engineering jobs. %$* 553
so, i used to work at bechtel and bp, you know what bechtel and bp's biggest problem is? %$* 553
it's about getting young people into that business, into their businesses. %$* 553
because people don't want to be drilling engineers. %$* 553
they want to be solar entrepreneurs and energy engineers. %$* 553
so-- %$* 553
well, we need to change their minds. %$* 554
steven hayward, of jobs and clean energy. %$* 13
well, i wrote down something kassia said earlier about “oil won't help us with our economic predicament.” well, tell that to the people of north dakota, which currently has a 3.5 percent unemployment rate because they're having an oil boom. %$* 552
and, by the way, it's the state where they budget surplus, which governor ritter might find it a nice thing to have. %$* 552
i am tempted, by the way, to ask governor ritter, maybe i will, how many jobs might you get in colorado if we opened up the oil shale, 800 billion barrels worth that the department of energy says could be produced at about $50 a barrel. %$* 552
that might produce some jobs for something we actually need, which is more oil supply. %$* 552
right, right. %$* 13
but the question, and i take your point that the oil industry provides jobs, but their point is that the clean energy industry will provide jobs. %$* 13
and what did you just %$* 13
you know, i testified on the green exports idea to a congressional committee a few months ago, and i looked up the latest figures. %$* 552
we currently have a $20 billion trade deficit in green energy components, wind, and solar, and things of that kind, because, and that's why the company in massachusetts moved to china. %$* 552
like our computer manufacturers, robert mentioned, they can make it cheaper than we do. %$* 552
they also have the raw materials that we don't have, by the way. %$* 552
we only have one lithium mine in this country, by the way, we can talk about lithium batteries later, if we want. %$* 552
and so, you know, i agree to some extent that we will do a lot of innovating here, but the manufacturing is going to be done overseas, folks, for all the traditional reasons, sorry about that. %$* 552
well that's not true about wind-- %$* 551
bill ritter. %$* 13
that's not true at all about wind, we've got vestas wind turbines, that's 2,600 jobs. %$* 551
you can't make small of 2,600 jobs in a state like colorado, it's five million people. %$* 551
and a variety of other parts of the wind manufacturing sector. %$* 551
and, quite frankly, you have it in pennsylvania, you have it, i think, in ohio, you have it in iowa. %$* 551
where there is wind manufacturing, you cannot do those jobs in canada, or china, and that's part of the reason vestas located there. %$* 551
but even as it relates to solar. %$* 551
i wonder if there's a debate in china tonight, where they're saying, “you know, suntech moved to arizona, and they're making things in arizona, and so, this is a bad thing for us to do in china, to invest in an innovation economy.” they're not doing that. %$* 551
and there are solar companies that are coming here, manufacturing here, from china. %$* 551
there's exports we have to china. %$* 551
and the solar industry itself is a net exporter outside of the united states. %$* 551
it exports more than it brings in. %$* 551
well, fair enough, i mean-- %$* 554
robert bryce. %$* 13
i'm much more bullish on solar than i am on wind, and if you look at the data from john byrne at the university of delaware, he talks about the learning rate in the solar industry and solar pv, and has talked a lot about the price on solar pv coming down. %$* 554
i'm very encouraged by that. %$* 554
i have pv panels on the roof of my house; i wish i was able to buy them now instead of eight, nine years ago, as i did. %$* 554
but what is happening globally? %$* 554
and then, when we talk about what's happening in the u.s.in europe, holland, spain, germany, all across the eu, we're seeing huge cuts in these renewable solar, renewable energy subsidies. %$* 554
in your own home state, governor, xcel is cutting their solar subsidies by half. %$* 554
why? %$* 554
because they're too expensive. %$* 554
now, let me address the issue of cost here. %$* 554
because as i pointed out, the eia numbers show that renewable energy from solar and wind is significantly more expensive than is conventional electricity. %$* 554
forty-three million americans are today on food stamps. %$* 554
they've set records, now. %$* 554
twenty-six consecutive months, the food stamp roles in this country have increased. %$* 554
the food stamp roles today are 40 percent higher than they were just three or four years ago. %$* 554
do you think that these people are living on the edge of hunger, care whether their electricity is green or not? %$* 554
all right. %$* 13
i don't think they do. %$* 554
i want to go to the audience for some questions now. %$* 13
and i want to remind you again, to make, keep it terse, and to try to think of, keep our motion in mind, that we want to stay on this topic, and, this very rich topic is very easy to go off in many different directions. %$* 13
we really want to bring it on, back to the issue of the effect on the economy of the clean energy industry and developing it. %$* 13
and, if you raise your hand, there are people in the audience who will come to you with microphones, and hold it about this far away from your mouth, about a fist's distance away, so that it can be picked up on the radio and television broadcasts. %$* 13
and before we do that, i just need to do one more little bit for television and radio. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.our motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion. %$* 13
“clean energy can drive america’s recovery.” all right, let’s go to some questions now. %$* 13
there’s a gentleman in a blue shirt and a blue blazer, right at the edge of the aisle. %$* 13
all right, mr. %$* 18
hayward, we’re in new york city, ny university. %$* 18
as you walk around the city, look up at the chimneys and you’ll see the black smoke coming out. %$* 18
well, here at nyu, the institute of policy integrity teaches us that one percent of the buildings in new york city burning bunker fuel produces as much pollution as all of the cars and trucks in the city. %$* 18
two hundred and fifty-nine people die every year because of respiratory diseases. %$* 18
over $1 billion a year in health costs-- %$* 18
what is your question, sir? %$* 13
economic benefits are almost a billion dollars. %$* 18
it seems to me that replacing the bunker fuel with natural gas, okay, would be vastly cleaner, would give us lots of jobs, would return almost $2 billion to our economy on a yearly basis. %$* 18
that would help our economic recovery. %$* 18
steven hayward. %$* 13
now the odd thing to me is that it’s still allowed to be burned in new york city or any urban area. %$* 552
the odd thing about new york’s air quality-- %$* 552
i did a whole book on air pollution a few years ago, conventional air pollution-- %$* 552
is air pollution levels are actually higher in the suburbs in downtown manhattan for some really odd and quirky reasons. %$* 552
look, i won’t quote with your figures. %$* 552
the epa’s got a thing out last week about conventional energy. %$* 552
i’m not sure that it nets out to saying that this is going to be an engine that’s going to drive our economy the way housing has done in previous sectors, the way high technology has done. %$* 552
and that’s the promise of the resolution tonight. %$* 552
you see, this is going to lead us to a boom, right. %$* 552
and i’m just saying that it seems to me it looks like any other sector that will produce only modest results. %$* 552
sir, what do you think of that answer? %$* 13
if you could rise again, so the camera can find you. %$* 13
do you feel your question was addressed? %$* 13
no, i didn’t. %$* 18
why? %$* 13
but be specific. %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
i think he just disagreed with you. %$* 13
it may be. %$* 18
this is a question of perceptions. %$* 18
to me, it sounded like you just avoided it. %$* 18
if we put-- %$* 18
no, i said i don’t know why it’s allowed to have bunker fuel being burned here at all. %$* 552
it astounds me. %$* 552
it would have been shut down in l.a. 30 years ago. %$* 552
well, i think there are a lot of people who would say we don’t understand why it’s allowed to burn oil just about anywhere, why it’s allowed to burn coal anywhere. %$* 18
we have much cleaner alternatives. %$* 18
converting to those alternatives in many cases will be cheaper, and this new york example is very specific, which is vastly cheaper. %$* 18
robert bryce. %$* 13
natural gas is much cheaper than bunker fuel. %$* 18
fair enough, but did you arrive here by car tonight? %$* 554
no question, i live in new york city. %$* 18
i took the subway. %$* 18
don’t have cars in new york city. %$* 18
i came here in a car, and it burned that dirty, nasty oil, and so i’m kind of biased toward it, i guess. %$* 18
come live in a city where it’s clean. %$* 18
let’s go to this side. %$* 13
that one hurt by the way, it really did. %$* 554
yeah, you walked into that. %$* 13
i did. %$* 554
i’m really glad i went back to you on that. %$* 13
there’s a gentleman in a leather jacket right by the end of the aisle. %$* 13
and if there are folks in the back where the lights aren’t on, i want to let you know, i can’t see you but there are some seats down towards the front. %$* 13
if you want to make your way down, i could then see you and call on you. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
on the subject of cost, can both panels give us an outlook-- %$* 18
their outlook-- %$* 18
for the price of oil, let’s say going out five, seven, 10 years, because that seems to be key to the proposition. %$* 18
if the price of oil spikes and stays there, then there is really no choice but to innovate. %$* 18
if the panel thinks it stays flat or goes down, then we have options. %$* 18
let’s let kassia, yes, you can take that. %$* 13
okay, so, i’ll answer in two parts. %$* 553
number one, the spike issue-- %$* 553
i think that we’re vulnerable to price spikes in any environment over the next five to seven years. %$* 553
currently we’re experiencing a price spike. %$* 553
we could see that again in two years. %$* 553
we could see that in five years. %$* 553
we could see that in another month. %$* 553
i think that one other point i would make, and this is based on my experience at bp, which is that, we’re not going to see oil at $10 or $20 a barrel anymore. %$* 553
and part of that is because the above- ground and below-ground risks have changed for the oil industry. %$* 553
so, number one, we have to drill further and in more difficult places to get the oil out of the ground. %$* 553
clearly, we’ve seen that in the gulf of mexico incident. %$* 553
and then, secondly, the above-ground risks. %$* 553
so most of the oil in the future is going to be developed in non-oecd countries, and we’re already seeing that happen. %$* 553
so what does that mean? %$* 553
it means that the natural oil companies have more control over their resources and that it is certainly raising the cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground for the iocs, for the independent oil companies. %$* 553
and is the point of your question then that as the price of oil goes higher, it makes alternatives more viable economically? %$* 13
if it goes high enough, there’s really no choice. %$* 18
okay, let me put that to the other side. %$* 13
steven hayward. %$* 13
yeah, it’s-- %$* 552
this is an interesting question, and i’m almost reluctant to take it on because it’s going to help out the other side slightly perhaps if they have the wit to pick up on it. %$* 552
we actually already got off oil once. %$* 552
in the late 1970s, oil was the number two source of electricity generation in this country, and now it’s less than one percent. %$* 552
and how do we do it? %$* 552
well, coal and nuclear power. %$* 552
and the interesting thing is that in the first oil shocks in the ‘70s, about half of our energy-- %$* 552
total energy consumption was from oil. %$* 552
today it’s now about 35 percent. %$* 552
we’ve gradually electrified more. %$* 552
and so, some of the things we’ve briefly mentioned tonight like electric cars, better battery storage and so forth, that would give us some option over time to accelerate a transition away from oil. %$* 552
i’ll just say about the first part of the question, predicting oil prices out five years has made fools out of more people than i’m able to keep count of, and so i don’t do it anymore. %$* 552
and there aren’t any simple solutions to that. %$* 552
well, that almost does help the other side, your answer. %$* 13
i can see why you didn’t want to take it on. %$* 13
i’d like to get a female voice, but everybody raising hands that i see-- %$* 13
ah, thank you. %$* 13
let the mic come on down, just for the balance. %$* 13
i have a question about other kinds of consumer products because there’s a lot of focus on the automobile industry and, like, you guys mentioned computer products, but what about growth in other kinds of consumer products, like that seems like that could be a possibility to grow the economy? %$* 19
in relation to-- %$* 13
but how do you relate that to the energy issue? %$* 13
i’m not sure what you’re saying. %$* 13
oh, i’m saying that there’s a lot of products that have been advertising themselves as like green products. %$* 19
okay, thank you. %$* 13
steven hayward. %$* 13
to sort of address that, i’d recommend reading john tierney’s column in the new york times today that talks about one of the problems in energy efficiency is that we end up consuming more energy down the road. %$* 552
so, one of my favorite examples is jet aircraft engines, 70 percent more energy efficient than they were 30 years ago. %$* 552
do we use more jet fuel or less jet fuel today than 30 years ago? %$* 552
well, more because we fly more because it brought the price down. %$* 552
so everybody’s got these things, right. %$* 552
these things have the electricity footprint of a refrigerator, not the device itself. %$* 552
that’s absurd obviously, but when you think about the network of cell towers and the electricity that goes into all the servers that we plug into and we download data and make calls, that gives each one of these smart phones that we all have the electricity footprint of a refrigerator. %$* 552
so we get a lot more energy efficient appliances through mandates and standards and also the marketplace driving it that way, but we find more things to spend energy on, which is why even though we get more efficient year by year-- %$* 552
actually better than european countries in the last 10 years-- %$* 552
our energy consumption continues to go up. %$* 552
we keep buying gadgets like that. %$* 552
i want to take the question to the other side, bill ritter, because i think the question was, in a sense, talking about refrigerators and other green energy-rated devices and that that’s the sort of innovation that i think your side is talking about, that there’s growth there and that there are jobs there. %$* 13
if dan reicher were here and not stuck behind an avalanche in utah, he would now tell a joke about a fridge to the future because he talks about refrigerators as this way to think about energy efficiency and, you know, the energy use of those refrigerators has come down, there’s greater volume, and 75 percent less energy use since the early 1970s because of a commitment to innovation. %$* 551
you’re right. %$* 551
you know, as it relates to the pda, they’re very-- %$* 551
they go to data centers. %$* 551
those data centers consume a lot of energy. %$* 551
that makes our point, right. %$* 551
we can’t keep the demand for energy growing. %$* 551
you said at one point in time that it’s less, but then you just said it’s more. %$* 551
and i think, you know, you look at ibm. ibm understands they use data centers very heavily, and you know what ibm’s made a commitment to? %$* 551
green energy. %$* 551
and they’ve made a commitment to clean energy because they understand that there are costs maybe apart from just the economic costs of continuing to have this industry that uses so much energy rely on fossil fuels or rely heavily on coal. %$* 551
so ibm in colorado has the greenest data center i think, maybe, in america, and they did it specifically because of their energy demand growing and not wanting to be viewed as a polluter. %$* 551
did he get you? %$* 13
well, okay, being in favor of efficiency is like saying you’re in favor of air or breathing. %$* 554
i mean, at a certain point, it makes no-- %$* 554
it doesn’t set you apart at all. %$* 554
the economy is becoming more efficient because, as steve’s example with the iphone. %$* 554
you mentioned flat screen televisions. %$* 554
as flat screen televisions become cheaper, people buy more of them. %$* 554
i don’t know how many-- %$* 554
i have seven computers in my house now. %$* 554
i used to just have one. %$* 554
now part of it-- %$* 554
i have teenagers, but the reality is that as we become more efficient, we use more because we have more excess money to then buy more, to do more. %$* 554
so this is not a new area of study. %$* 554
the jevons paradox, william stanley jevons, 1865, wrote a book called, “the coal question”, laid this out very clearly, and so the idea-- %$* 554
and he said it very clearly. %$* 554
he said that, in fact, as you become more efficient you use more fuel. %$* 554
it is paradoxical. %$* 554
now, in the u.s.and the developed countries we may be plateau-ing in terms of our energy use, but look at the three billion other people who live in the five most populous countries in the world, china, india, brazil, pakistan, and indonesia, they use on a per capita basis one-tenth as much energy as we do. %$* 554
so, the fact is, as we become more efficient, we are. %$* 554
all around the world people are becoming more efficient, but they’re using more energy because it’s our nature to do so. %$* 554
all right, let’s go back to the audience. %$* 13
sir, you're-- %$* 13
got-- %$* 13
i’m looking right at you. %$* 13
if you just stand up-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he just went like that. %$* 13
got an unusual hat on. %$* 13
i didn’t want to say the hat part but worked. %$* 13
it's actually the teenage mutant ninja turtles, michelangelo. %$* 18
just thought i’d educate you in that. %$* 18
that’s good. %$* 13
that's good. %$* 13
all right. %$* 18
don’t make me regret this. %$* 13
i think you already do. %$* 554
well, i guess that alleviates my first question. %$* 18
my second question would be-- %$* 18
this is to all of you-- %$* 18
where should america see the rest of the world in this? %$* 18
like, should we see them as enemies, should we see them as friends, business partners, should we see their governments as business partners? %$* 18
i mean, where does the rest of the world play into america’s economic recovery in terms of clean energy? %$* 18
kassia yanosek. %$* 13
i think we see them as all of the above. %$* 553
i certainly would say that when i think about where i want to be putting my dollars to work i think about, “where are my export markets? %$* 553
where are my customers? %$* 553
” i mentioned a statistic earlier tonight that 90 percent of the real energy growth that’s going to be happening over the next two decades is in non-oecd countries-- %$* 553
developing countries. %$* 553
so we have to be partnering, we have to be developing our customer base; we have to be developing the appropriate trade policies. %$* 553
you know, one of the points that was made earlier tonight was that apple was viewed as a great company, and apple has innovated here in the united states, the value is created, the ip is here, some of the manufacturing's abroad. %$* 553
we’re going to have to have some, not all, certainly for the large cap-ex projects where it makes sense to have local industry develop those products like wind, that needs to be domestic, but for certainly for a lot of other products we will need to partner with place-- %$* 553
with countries like china. %$* 553
robert bryce. %$* 13
just quickly in terms of one of the issues-- %$* 554
in terms-- %$* 554
your question is a complicated one. %$* 554
i think we’re partners, we're competitors, it depends. %$* 554
but one of the best pieces of news that i’ve read in the last three months was in west bengal in india, ongc, the indian energy giant announced the first shale gas production from a shale gas well in west bengal. %$* 554
we’re seeing now shale gas production potential in poland, in australia, in china. %$* 554
the potential for natural gas is to set a new paradigm globally, for a low carbon, clean burning, energy source that is cheap, ultra abundant, and reliable to produce electricity to use for transportation is incredibly good news. %$* 554
where did it come from? %$* 554
it came from the united states. %$* 554
so are you agreeing with the other side on this point? %$* 13
with regard to innovation in-- %$* 554
yes, look-- %$* 554
well, innovation is-- %$* 554
innovation is innovation, and it is going to spread no matter whether it’s in the oil field or in flat screens tvs or whatever. %$* 554
we’re agreeing with them if we agree with their very elastic definition of clean. %$* 552
you’ll notice this in the old fossil fuel industry. %$* 552
i think the question is an interesting one, i think there’s two parts to it. %$* 552
one is the traditional question about competition for resources which is, you know, a big knotty question. %$* 552
the second one is closer to our resolutions about tonight which is competition for a technological edge in energy. %$* 552
so we hear that china’s going to spend 850 billion the next 10 years on renewable-- %$* 552
or, yeah, renewable energy, yeah, wind, and solar, and so forth. %$* 552
let’s just round up and call it an even trillion, you know, a lot more than we’re going to spend on it. %$* 552
partly, by the way, i think they’re creating an export industry to us saps, but that’s my opinion, but the other part of it is they’re going to spend five to $10 trillion on old fashioned coal and natural gas. %$* 552
india, the ratio will look similar because they need so much more energy and i think as robert says, i have a hunch that our export numbers in traditional coal, oil, and natural gas drilling is going to be a lot larger than our exports even in the best ip we have in the-- %$* 552
you know, batteries and other purely clean technology. %$* 552
your opponent arguing for clean energy, bill ritter would like to come in on this. %$* 13
i’m going to respond to this a little bit differently. %$* 551
i lived in zambia for three years as a catholic missionary and i’m telling you we could do all sorts of things in innovating products that we could export to very, very poor countries where their ability to use energy differently could help them expand their economies in a ways that we don't now think of. %$* 551
in the university that i'm now at, colorado state university, we developed a two-cycle engine at that university that really can reduce emissions in a tremendous way. %$* 551
if you think about india and the use the two cycle engine, so. %$* 551
we have, actually, this other thing that's, apart from just the economic driver, we have this other thing that happens with innovation, that can be very positive for some of the poorest places in the world. %$* 551
okay. %$* 13
ma'am in the blue, light, powder-blue sweater. %$* 13
this evening, no one's really addressed the fact that we have a very aging electric generation infrastructure. %$* 19
and that 50 percent of our generation today, approximately, is produced by coal. %$* 19
and most, many of those plants are very old and aging. %$* 19
and even the younger plants, that are maybe 20 years old, have been grossly under-invested in. %$* 19
so what i don't hear tonight is, it's not simply about, you know, making money, it's about the risk of producing electricity. %$* 19
it's not simply that the electricity grows, is not going to be there, it's that what's going to happen and who's going to produce the investment that needs to be made in our generation infrastructure-- %$* 19
all right, but that-- %$* 13
but, ma'am, that could go to either channel, so can you relate it to our, i mean convention-- %$* 13
i'd like to relate it to these folks, who have not really addressed this issue-- %$* 19
so what's-- %$* 13
it's a huge investment opportunity, for, it's an investment opportunity that our economy, quite frankly, cannot afford to miss. %$* 19
and i'd like your comments-- %$* 19
you mean investment in clean energy. %$* 13
i'm saying the investment in our electric generation infrastructure for the next 15 years. %$* 19
okay, i'm going to pass on the question, because i really need you to relate it to the motion, which is clean energy. %$* 13
well, the issue is that clean energy, and investment in things like fuel cell technology, okay, are critical to figuring out how the investment, for example, in our coal plants, needs to be made. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
and there's a whole area-- %$* 19
no, you did it, you hit it. %$* 13
so, robert bryce. %$* 13
if you look at any of the projections, deutsche bank did a report on this in december, the energy information administration, the vast majority of new electric generation capacity in the united states will be, over the next 20 years, natural gas-fired. %$* 554
and i'm fully in favor of fuel cells, they are still far too expensive to be commercially viable throughout most of the u.s., unless you're in california, where you get those big subsidies. %$* 554
what are they going to run on? %$* 554
natural gas. %$* 554
there's also the question about the grid there, which is a long subject-- %$* 552
yeah. %$* 553
that i think we shouldn't actually try. %$* 552
but if you really insist, we could do that. %$* 552
no, i'm not insisting. %$* 13
kassia yanosek. %$* 13
i'm going to make a quick point on this, because i think it's a very important one. %$* 553
and you're right, we did not really address it tonight. %$* 553
i work with utilities quite a bit, and those that are very exposed with their coal fleets-- %$* 553
they are very concerned, and very interested in figuring out energy, again, the future of energy innovation, and how they can strategize the future portfolio for the next five, 10, 20 years. %$* 553
and yes, natural gas is definitely going to be part of that solution. %$* 553
but guess what, we've had experiences where we've had a big build-up in natural gas power generation, i experienced it in california when i was working for bechtel, we were building and investing in natural gas power plants, one a week, almost. %$* 553
and guess what, the net price of natural gas spiked 10, $13 a kilowatt hour. %$* 553
so, guess what. %$* 553
we need to be thinking a bit broadly about how we're going to be developing our future generation plate, because you're absolutely right. %$* 553
we've got a big challenge ahead of us, and we need to be thinking very broadly about a big portfolio-- %$* 553
right. %$* 13
i don't think your side disagrees with what she just said. %$* 13
no, i-- %$* 554
no. %$* 552
we're moving more toward natural gas, not just in the u.s., but globally. %$* 554
why? %$* 554
because we're de-carbonizing the global economy. %$* 554
the de-carbonization trend has been underway for 200 years. %$* 554
it's going to continue for the next 200. %$* 554
it will include solar panels, it will include fuel cells, it will include a lot of things. %$* 554
but we're moving toward cleaner fuels. %$* 554
why? %$* 554
because it's what we want as consumers. %$* 554
okay. %$* 554
so that sounds like that could drive the economic recovery in america, to do that, right? %$* 551
it will, because natural gas is cheap. %$* 554
natural gas is only one part of it, though. %$* 551
we're getting, i mean, and i agree, it is a part of it. %$* 551
we actually are promoting the use of natural gas. %$* 551
but to focus it solely on that fossil fuel is still-- %$* 551
let me just ask one question, then, governor. %$* 554
so you're pro-natural gas, i am too. %$* 554
so a lot of our natural gas is produced alongside oil. %$* 554
so you're bringing oil and gas out of the same well bore. %$* 554
so the natural gas is clean, but the oil is dirty. %$* 554
no, i wasn't saying that at all. %$* 551
but i do think, i didn't say that oil was dirty. %$* 551
what i said is, we have a supply of natural gas, it is cleaner burning, we have the technology and government sponsored the natural gas turbine to get to a place where it became more efficient, and increased its efficiency by 30 percent. %$* 551
interesting that it was a government subsidy that actually made that happen, but the fact of the matter is that natural gas or oil should not be the only part of our portfolio. %$* 551
if we really look at this from an emissions perspective, you get a 50 percent reduction in emissions at best from natural gas when you transfer it from coal. %$* 551
but with a portfolio that includes all these other things, we can get to this 80 percent reduction by 2050. we can’t get to there from a natural gas-- %$* 551
it won’t happen, no way. %$* 554
not a chance. %$* 554
i can’t believe that nobody ever seems to do the math on this, except by the way for some researchers at the university of colorado in the governor’s home state. %$* 552
that 80 percent reduction takes us back to, as i mentioned earlier, about a billion tons of co2. the last time we emitted a billion tons of co2 from fossil fuel sources in this country was over 100 years ago when we only had 92 million people living in the country. %$* 552
one factoid for you: if the share of just our households, so our houses and apartments and condos that we all live in, if the share of co2 emissions from the household sector is proportionally the same in 2050 as it is today, the emissions of co2 will have to be no more than 206 million tons. %$* 552
today, carbon dioxide emissions from current household natural gas use: 236 million tons. %$* 552
we cannot use more natural gas and make that target, governor. %$* 552
the math does not add up. %$* 552
quick point, john. %$* 554
to hit that 80 percent reduction by 2050 would take u.s.co2 emissions to current level of emissions in north korea, syria, or cuba. %$* 554
it is not going to happen. %$* 554
it is a pipe dream, and i think it’s irresponsible for the government to even be repeating those numbers, and the president has said them and i think it’s just-- %$* 554
all right, once the word “irresponsible” come out, i have to give you a comeback on that. %$* 13
no, i don’t think it’s irresponsible at all. %$* 551
this is totally achievable. %$* 551
this is totally achievable through a variety of strategies that include investment in clean energy, that includes renewables, that includes nuclear, that we can look, and we’ve said clean coal-- %$* 551
people are like, what’s clean coal? %$* 551
well there is also-- %$* 551
can you give me an emissions inventory? %$* 552
what’s that? %$* 551
can you give me an emissions inventory for 2050, of specific sources that will add up to more than a billion tons? %$* 552
well, no, i’m not able to sitting right here, but what i’m telling you is that it’s absolutely achievable and the reason it’s achievable. %$* 551
so, i don’t know-- %$* 551
if it’s absolutely achievable, you ought to be able to tell us how. %$* 552
i think we’ve reached a point-- %$* 13
we’re at the religious stage of the-- %$* 13
can i finish one thing? %$* 551
steven chu’s a-- %$* 551
he’s a nobel laureate, right. %$* 551
he’s the secretary of energy, and what he’ll tell you is that 40 percent of those emissions reductions you get from retrofitting the built environment, so it’s not about growing the portfolio. %$* 551
it’s about finding ways to do energy efficiency. %$* 551
that’s statistically misstated, by the way. %$* 552
it’s from our building sector, you get 40 percent. %$* 552
that’s not 40 percent of total emissions. %$* 552
it’s only about 10 percent total emissions. %$* 552
all right. %$* 13
i’m going to cut this off, and there’s a bearded gentlemen-- %$* 13
we were making eye contact before. %$* 13
would really love it if you didn’t read your question because you know what it is. %$* 13

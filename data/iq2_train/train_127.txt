and-- %$* 378
can i add to this? %$* 378
i know that they get more time as a result. %$* 378
yes. %$* 13
but in 2008 amazon bought a company called, "booksurge," which provided print on demand services for small publishers-- %$* 378
often for out-of-print books. %$* 378
and amazon immediately turned around to those small publishers and told them they would not have access any longer to the amazon site unless they used booksurge, which at that time offered a more expensive product. %$* 378
and the publishers had to choose between doing any business at all or standing up to amazon. %$* 378
matt yglesias. %$* 13
you know, something that connects i think the last two points that i saw recently is that the world of public domain books, you know, books that are old and out of copyright, thanks to amazon you can go online like right now and you can get the complete works of jane austen for free. %$* 376
that's pretty great for readers, it seems to me, and not something traditional publishers are interested in doing, they're not making money that way. %$* 376
and it's just an example of the way in which a relentless desire to kind of serve this digital market, to serve consumers, to gain as big a share as possible, has really made amazon a reader's friend by getting that long tail, including the books that are completely free, out there and into the hands of as many people who want-- %$* 376
and, joe konrath, do you want to comment on that? %$* 13
no. %$* 375
okay. %$* 13
go to another question. %$* 13
let's see. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
sir, sweater and shirt, yeah. %$* 13
me? %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
well, i meant the fellow in front of you, but you win by aggression. %$* 13
i hate to reward it but i'm going to. %$* 13
do you need a mic? %$* 13
oh, i didn't even know you were down there. %$* 13
i'll let you go. %$* 13
in the interests of time, that was-- %$* 13
see that was aggressive, and that was sneaky, and i like that. %$* 13
he's the amazon of the audience. %$* 376
so, my name is stephen i'm a full disclosure business student, and textbooks are expensive. %$* 18
but getting to my real question-- %$* 18
so there's plenty of other destructive business models happening, whether it be in the music industry with spotify and the like, but ultimately the adaptability i think ends up generating more value for the users. %$* 18
so, whether it be the amazon be the reader's friend or the publishing houses be the reader's friend, i kind of wonder in this unrest in the book economy what you guys view as the projection of being value added for the reader. %$* 18
i'm going to pass on that question because i don't think it's going to help us vote on the motion, but thank you for the question. %$* 13
and my original-- %$* 13
you won through patience. %$* 13
hi, my name is eric two questions quickly for matt yglesias. %$* 18
just make it one question, okay? %$* 13
pick one. %$* 13
one question for matt yglesias. %$* 18
the stock market values amazon at a really high level despite the fact that it's never made any money, and, of course, that's because the stock market with the support of the management of the company believes that they're going to change what they do and ultimately take advantage of the control of the individual markets that they dominate to raise prices and to do things that are more profitable for the company. %$* 18
so, my question for you is, is it possible that you think that amazon is a friend to readers today, but that five years from now or 10 years from now it won't any longer be friends to readers? %$* 18
matt yglesias. %$* 13
well, you know, the-- %$* 376
the stock is actually down 25 percent over the past year and-- %$* 376
almost a dollars. %$* 18
yeah, yeah, yeah, but, i mean, 25 percent is a lot, and that's during the context of a rising stock market. %$* 376
and i think that's happening because the investing community has begun to lose faith in this idea that this kind of cut prices to the bone, dominate everything then jack the prices up, it's dawning on them that that doesn't really work, that you can build a successful business of low margins and high volume and that there's some real value to that, but that this like monopoly doomsday scenario of theirs is not realistic and it's not financially realistic. %$* 376
that's why you've seen share prices starting to go down. %$* 376
that's why you've seen investors backing new e-retail startups, because they see there isn't this kind of opportunity for monopolization that people fear. %$* 376
so, your answer to the question again is that you just don't think it's a realistic scenario? %$* 13
well, i mean, i don't think it's true that the stock market even thinks it's a realistic scenario. %$* 376
but that wasn't the question. %$* 13
you don't think it's a real-- %$* 13
i don't, yes, and i think investors-- %$* 376
you don't think amazon's become more interested in a profit in the last year? %$* 378
well, they've started to become interested, but this is-- %$* 376
they raised the price of prime 25 percent. %$* 378
scott, i understand that, but i'm saying this is the question, right, is do they have the ability to first secure monopoly then jack up prices and receive these huge %$* 376
i-- %$* 378
wall street feels that they don't have that opportunity, which is why their stock prices started to go down. %$* 376
now if you want to talk specifically about books and price increases we should talk about the time the big five book publishers and apple formed a cartel to fix prices and raise them. %$* 376
that's why e-book prices have gone up, which is separate from prime and amazon and all that other stuff. %$* 376
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is: amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
remember. %$* 13
thanks very much for all the questions. %$* 13
it was-- %$* 13
they were great. %$* 13
remember how you voted? %$* 13
as soon as you hear the closing statements, which will be very brief, they're two minutes each, and eight minutes from now we will be voting. %$* 13
two minutes from that we get the response. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
they will be three minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is: amazon is the reader's friend and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, joe konrath. %$* 13
he's author of several dozen novels, including "the jack daniels thriller series." %$* 13
i have one fan. %$* 375
thank you. %$* 375
i have three minutes or two minutes? %$* 375
okay. %$* 375
two minutes. %$* 375
you know, i'm thinking can i finish in two minutes and i know my wife is watching this and she's like you always finish in two minutes. %$* 375
i'm not going to-- %$* 375
hey, hey, you're wasting my time. %$* 375
i'm not going to sum up everything. %$* 375
i'm not going to use any more-- %$* 375
i'm not going to introduce any new data. %$* 375
i'm not going to introduce any new facts. %$* 375
i'm not going to try to sway over on the logic here, i'm going to say this one thing. %$* 375
i will bribe you if you change your vote to amazon is a friend to readers. %$* 375
this is how i'm going to bribe you. %$* 375
i'm going to give you all of my e-books for free and because i know scott is such a fan of piracy i'm also going to give you all of his e-books. %$* 375
for free. %$* 375
actually, of course, i'm kidding, but underneath that, i'm kind of not kidding. %$* 375
i have the ability to with amazon give away my books, put them on sale, lower the price, make them free. %$* 375
i've sold millions of books. %$* 375
i've given away millions of books. %$* 375
amazon allows me to do that. %$* 375
tell me that's not being a friend to a reader and remember please vote amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 375
thank you. %$* 375
thank you, joe konrath. %$* 13
that's our motion: amazon is the reader's friend and here to summarize his position against this motion, scott turow. %$* 13
he is former president of the author's guild and author of "presumed innocent." %$* 13
i'm probably dating myself as i usually do, but long ago on saturday night live garrett morris played a character called the chico escuela and chico used to say regularly "baseball been berry berry good to me."and the truth of the matter is amazon has been very, very good to me. %$* 378
they have sold thousands and thousands of my books with their relentless discounting that has driven sales on which when you talk about hardcover books very nice for me because i get a full royalty on each of those sales. %$* 378
there was a time, as the matter of fact, that jeff bezos even invited me to his little thought colloquia the campfires until i remarked that they were the darth vader of the literary world. %$* 378
and the invitations ceased-- %$* 378
have ceased coming. %$* 378
i do not judge things on the basis of what's good for me. %$* 378
in point of fact, i spent 20 years trying to get my first novel published. %$* 378
i was joe konrath and that experience never leaves me. %$* 378
and i am concerned about what is good for authors in general, not what's good for best-selling authors. %$* 378
amazon wins. %$* 378
we all have to become entrepreneurs. %$* 378
the best-selling authors are the people who will prosper most in that situation, because it's an undifferentiated mass. %$* 378
people whose names are already known would be the winners. %$* 378
but i know-- %$* 378
i know that the system we have now-- %$* 378
yes, great, joe, good. %$* 378
i really and truly am happy that you have found an audience. %$* 378
i want every author to find an audience who deserves one. %$* 378
but the system that has perpetuated that is that of traditional publishers. %$* 378
and remember that these gentlemen do not deny that amazon's ultimate goal is to describe-- %$* 378
is to destroy traditional publishing, to force every author to become an entrepreneur, his own marketer, his own editor, and we will lose good writers in the process. %$* 378
thank you. %$* 13
scott turow. %$* 13
the motion is amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
and here summarizing his position supporting this motion, matt yglesias, executive editor of vox.com. %$* 13
i think it's really important when you consider voting on this motion to really think about and listen to the arguments that our opponents have made. %$* 376
they have raised a lot of interesting ideas. %$* 376
but they're all-- %$* 376
they're these very complicated, very hypothetical ideas with a lot of red herrings and a lot of distractions from the core question here, which is, has amazon been and is it now a friend to readers? %$* 376
i mean, they haven't really disputed that it is, that amazon has made books cheaper, that amazon has made books more convenient, that amazon is outcompeting the largest and richest technology companies in the world by offering a superior platform for shopping for books. %$* 376
now, it is true that if many, many things that are not true became true at some hypothetical time, through impossible mechanisms, amazon might be an enemy to readers in that world. %$* 376
i studied philosophy in college and this possible world stuff-- %$* 376
it's fascinating. %$* 376
and you can-- %$* 376
thanks to amazon-- %$* 376
go buy david lewis's book about the causal analysis of counterfactuals. %$* 376
you can get edited volumes that were written by his students. %$* 376
and you can really mull through this kind of stuff about these complex things. %$* 376
but if there was no amazon, it would be extremely difficult to find david lewis's book or all those other books about the metaphysics of causality, hypotheticals, et cetera-- %$* 376
because you know, brick and mortar bookstores have limited spaces. %$* 376
they don't want to carry that crap. %$* 376
you know, maybe right by a college campus they would, but in general, no. %$* 376
amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 376
you can get all these books there. %$* 376
and that's pretty great, you know? %$* 376
do they want to take over the world? %$* 376
sure. %$* 376
of course they do. %$* 376
and their nefarious plan for taking over the book world is to create the cheapest, best, and most convenient way to buy books. %$* 376
they are the reader's friend. %$* 376
that's how they got so big. %$* 376
that's why we're debating this. %$* 376
other people with other interests have legitimate beefs with amazon, but they got those beefs because amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 376
thanks, matt yglesias. %$* 13
and that's the motion, amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, frank foer, former editor of the new republic. %$* 13
we live in a fast-moving world. %$* 377
disruption is our secular religion. %$* 377
and a lot of the things that get disrupted-- %$* 377
and are replaced with something good. %$* 377
a lot of things that get disrupted just disappear. %$* 377
and we, as americans, are very optimistic. %$* 377
we can always assume that things are going to work out for the best. %$* 377
but here, we're dealing with something very, very special and very, very important. %$* 377
and the economics of the book business-- %$* 377
and therefore, the substance of it-- %$* 377
are about to change. %$* 377
it could be wonderful. %$* 377
it could be a dystopian hell. %$* 377
they have not answered two fundamental things. %$* 377
the first is that amazon already is a monopoly. %$* 377
by any traditional standard, they are a monopoly. %$* 377
they control 67 percent of the e-book market, 40 percent of the total book market. %$* 377
they are there. %$* 377
it's one corporation with lots of power over our most precious things. %$* 377
and so, you tonight have the opportunity to take a stand. %$* 377
i guarantee you amazon is watching tonight. %$* 377
but here's the thing. %$* 377
your stand is cost-free in one regard. %$* 377
it's not going to bring in any government regulation. %$* 377
you're not going to put anybody out of business. %$* 377
but you have a chance to send the message to amazon and say, "look, be careful, guys. %$* 377
you're dealing with precious cargo. %$* 377
we're watching you. %$* 377
you have a lot of power right now. %$* 377
your power is probably going to keep increasing. %$* 377
don't abuse it."and so, you know, maybe you don't believe in the worst hypothetical scenarios that we've talked about here. %$* 377
but you care about the word. %$* 377
you care about the thought, you care about the underlying thing. %$* 377
and so be brave, take a stand, vote against this resolution, and be good stewards of word and thought. %$* 377
thank you, frank foer. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements and round three of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued most persuasively. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to go again to the keypads at your seats and to vote a second time. %$* 13
and, remember, it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms between the opening and the closing will be declared our winner. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion that "amazon is the reader's friend," we're asking you to push button number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push button number two. %$* 13
if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
okay, while you're doing that, i would like to say this. %$* 13
it was very, very-- %$* 13
it was a really fascinating thing to see four men of letters and lovers of books disagree so bitterly on something that's so personal to them and actually do it in a very respectful and civil way. %$* 13
i just want to ask for a round of applause for the way they did this. %$* 13
and i want to say to frank foer, since you knew amazon was watching, what you had to say up there was very, very brave and courageous of you. %$* 13
and i wanted to say to joe konrath, after hearing the writer type described as sort of "shy and introverted," i want to congratulate you on overcoming this obstacle tonight and getting up on this stage. %$* 13
i also want to thank the people who have been supporting intelligence squared for the last several years, and particularly in the past year, as the ticket sales do not in any way come close to covering the cost of putting on one of these debates. %$* 13
and we're counting on and have been counting on the support of a lot of people, but we need the support of many, many more. %$* 13
and i really mean it when i say the size of the contribution doesn't matter, but it would make a very, very big impact on our ability to continue doing these and to do more of them. %$* 13
if you go to our website, you have the opportunity to donate there, and it would be really, really something that we would really, really appreciate. %$* 13
speaking of keeping this going, our next debate is right here at the kaufman center on wednesday, it's february 11. it will be our 100th debate. %$* 13
yeah, we started back in 2006.and we're hitting number 100 this year. %$* 13
so, we hope you can all come and celebrate it with us. %$* 13
that debate is going to be focusing on sort of the-- %$* 13
a very sort of big picture look at the prospects for this nation. %$* 13
and the motion is going to be framed this way, "declinists be damned: bet on america."our debaters include a german publisher, a geopolitical strategist, a member of the canadian parliament, and a finance guru. %$* 13
we'll keep you in suspense on who's on whose side on that one. %$* 13
but you can check it out on our website. %$* 13
and we're going to be looking through the rest of the season at this whole role of power. %$* 13
our debates through this rest of the spring will be the right to be forgotten. %$* 13
we're going to be looking at presidential war powers, we're going to be looking at abolishing the death penalty, and, finally, on whether smart tech is making us dumb. %$* 13
for the full list of our debates and to purchase tickets, you can go to our website. %$* 13
and i mentioned in the beginning we have a terrific app that we launched this year. %$* 13
and when i say it's terrific, you can see all of the debates that we've done, including this one, the 99th and the next one coming up. %$* 13
you can hear them as well as podcasts. %$* 13
you can vote. %$* 13
you can do research. %$* 13
you can find out who's going to-- %$* 13
who our panelists are. %$* 13
it's a very, very rich and deep app, and it's mobile. %$* 13
so, we recommend that, and i think i've covered all of that. %$* 13
the results are in now. %$* 13
we've had you vote twice on this motion, "amazon is the reader's friend," once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and, remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's look at what the preliminary voting results were. %$* 13
the motion, "amazon is the reader's friend," before the vote-- %$* 13
before the debate 41 percent agreed with this motion, 28 percent were against, and 31 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those were the first results. %$* 13
now let's look at the second vote on this motion, the-- %$* 13
"amazon is the reader's friend." the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 42 percent. %$* 13
they went from 41 percent to 42 percent. %$* 13
they picked up one percentage point. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, first vote 28 percent, second vote 50 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 22 percentage points. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, "amazon is the reader's friend," has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13

that in some sense is the summary of everything i would say this evening. %$* 389
dan mitchell, slight-- %$* 13
slight variation on that question, is not having held a job for six to nine months to a year an accurate indicator of your ability to do a job well and to hold onto a job? %$* 13
well, there's no question we have a major problem with long term unemployment in this country. %$* 389
you know, five years ago i used to look at the oecd, organization for economic cooperation and development data, international bureaucracy based in paris. %$* 389
they look at industrialized countries, all sorts of interesting data. %$* 389
i don't think we should be subsidizing them, but that's a whole separate issue. %$* 389
it used to be that you would look at the data on six months-plus unemployment, and europe had the terrible numbers, and we had the great numbers. %$* 389
and now we've gone up to europe and in some cases beyond, in terms of our long term unemployment. %$* 389
now, interestingly, scholars like paul krugman and larry summers, at least when they're outside their new york times writing and their democratic administration appointments, have written that unemployment insurance subsidizes unemployment. %$* 389
now, as an economist-- %$* 389
wait, wait, wait, wait, what is the answer to my question, though? %$* 13
well, no, i'm making-- %$* 389
the answer to your question is that we have a problem with long term unemployment, one of the reasons we have this problem is because the academic data shows that people get jobs much quicker when their unemployment insurance runs out, but we now are going on 99 weeks of unemployment insurance, and it sounds like you're an ogre, and, yes, so hiss me, hiss me, but when even larry summers and paul krugman and their academic writings are saying, "this increases unemployment," we need to figure out a better way of doing it then. %$* 389
mark-- %$* 13
mark zandi, mark zandi, please. %$* 13
i just want to make one point about the jobs package. %$* 17
you know, there is money in the package, about 50 billion for unemployment insurance-- %$* 17
additional unemployment insurance, but in addition to that, there are a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance system that have been proposed. %$* 17
when cece talked about the work share that's very popular in germany and credited for german success, there's also a very popular program in georgia called georgia works that helps send unemployed workers to get on the job training. %$* 17
these are things that have historically had bipartisan support. %$* 17
there's empirical evidence that they work reasonably well. %$* 17
they do address some of the concerns dan brought up. %$* 17
i-- %$* 17
they're reasonable concerns. %$* 17
you know, you can't dismiss them. %$* 17
so i think it's very important to realize that in the package there are efforts to address some of these things. %$* 17
richard epstein. %$* 13
yes, i mean, to go back to the discrimination point and the part time point, on the discrimination issue, the evidence suggests that 150 firms have announced that they will not consider people. %$* 391
there are obviously going to be some more-- %$* 391
you're talking about millions of companies, and many people get first jobs, and it seems to me that you can-- %$* 391
if you got rid of minimum wage that's for teenagers it would do much more because then what you could do is to handle the problem of your decreased skills which everybody agrees takes place by making a compensating wage offer. %$* 391
and so freeing up markets will do much better than putting additional burdens on the overall economy in the way in which you're doing. %$* 391
with respect to part time workers and so forth, the other thing to remember is we've had a long term policy in which there's constantly the notion that there are mandates for the kinds of benefits that you must supply to full time employees, which leads to this fine art where everybody now tries to become an independent contractor so you don't have to supply health insurance in a variety of other situations. %$* 391
one way to improve the employment situation is to drop the mandate. %$* 391
and put it in another term. %$* 391
what the government has now said, there will be no jobs with lavish benefits or you can have real jobs with less benefits. %$* 391
in my view, if you’re trying to increase the employment levels, what you have to do is to stop putting the ties. %$* 391
if you wish to hire x, you must provide for them y.because what happens is that’s often the decider and it kills the labor markets. %$* 391
what we did for many, many years is to think that labor markets were robust so you could burden them with all sorts of restrictions. %$* 391
when you get bad times, these restrictions are a lot more costly and what they do is they create a lot more devastation. %$* 391
you can improve this market tomorrow. %$* 391
richard, i have to stop you thee because i need to take a break. %$* 13
do you know that when you speak, there’s only commas at the end of everything you say? %$* 13
was looking for the period to break in, and there were semicolons and dashes and commas. %$* 13
one continuous argument. %$* 391
cecilia, i’m going to do a little break and then i’m going to come back to have you respond to it and then we’re going to go back to questions from the audience. %$* 13
now i need some spontaneous applause from you, if you can do that. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is "congress should pass obama’s jobs plan piece by piece." we’re in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing this out and we are talking about the part of the jobs bill that would outlaw discrimination against workers who have been unemployed. %$* 13
and cecilia rouse is going to take up the point. %$* 13
so i just wanted to come back to that for just a moment because this law, what this proposes is not saying that employers have to hire a specific person. %$* 390
what it says is one, you can’t put it in the ad. %$* 390
okay that is true, that is a restriction. %$* 390
you can’t put in the ad that you will not look at an unemployed person. %$* 390
and two it says that there can’t be a blanket policy, so there can’t be a memo. %$* 390
so what is-- %$* 390
let me say, it’s a largely symbolic gesture. %$* 390
the obama administration caps damages at a thousand dollars if you actually put something in an ad. %$* 390
it caps it at $5,000 if you can come up with, if the eeoc, equal opportunity employment commission can actually come up with a memo documenting it. %$* 390
so it’s not, it’s meant to say look, we need for, at least, there not to be overt discrimination against those who are unemployed so we don’t discourage workers from trying to apply to a job. %$* 390
doesn’t the act though also, allow for a waiver that there would be a government official who would have the job of saying well in this case, we’re going to give you a pass. %$* 13
which does sound to me like one more layer of somebody making decisions for who you can hire and who you can’t and the ultimately this sin that is considered un- committable, you can commit if the government guy says this time we’ll let you go. %$* 13
look, it really is meant to-- %$* 390
governor christie in my fair state, our governor christie passed a law that was similar. %$* 390
i’m not saying that makes it okay. %$* 390
but what i’m saying is that, it really is a problem if unemployed workers are discouraged from applying for jobs. %$* 390
and it's really just saying employers try to make-- %$* 390
let’s move on to another topic. %$* 13
in the red top, thanks. %$* 13
i’m shaila dewan from the new york times and my question is for the no side. %$* 394
and the question is, what do you propose for the short term. %$* 394
i mean, if your proposals all seem to be about long term issues, if we’re going to do a tax cut, let’s make it permanent, that kind of thing. %$* 394
but what do you do for those unemployed people when their payments stop and they can’t get a job because there aren’t enough jobs? %$* 394
what is your fire truck from the firehouse i think is the question. %$* 13
richard epstein. %$* 13
the answer that i said is, the only way this thing will stop is through liberalization of markets. %$* 391
if you repeal the restrictions against people getting jobs, employers will start to hire again. %$* 391
the difficulty with the umemployment situation is that the amount of revenues we have to spend now is probably two or three times the amount of taxes that we collect. %$* 391
and what happens is you will not be able to reverse that pattern so long as you think that stimulus at the grand level-- %$* 391
but richard, the question is what is your short term solution? %$* 13
my short term solution is deregulation. %$* 391
get rid of mandates, get rid of minimum wages, get rid of the anti-discrimination proposals and so forth. %$* 391
because what you laugh about, i think it’s fine for you to laugh, but i think you also ought to reflect upon the fact that if you don’t have gains from trade, you don’t get employment. %$* 391
and what’s happened is every time you put an implicit tax on the trade, what you do is release the opportunities for gains. %$* 391
this is the interesting feature about this, is the macroeconomic stuff everybody guesses about. %$* 391
the microeconomic stuff is perfectly clear. %$* 391
okay, your partner dan mitchell. %$* 13
i would just like to make the point that good long-term policy also happens to be good short term policy. %$* 389
now i come from a school of thought that says that if the economy has misallocation of labor and capital and a recession gets baked into the cake, there's not much you can do but sort of just grit your teeth and try to get through it as quickly as possible. %$* 389
but government sometimes extends and delays and an economic downturn by interfering. %$* 389
i think that's what happened in the 1930s with the hoover-roosevelt policies. %$* 389
i want to have a lower burden of government. %$* 389
i sort of throughout, as a throwaway line, i want to be hong kong rather than france. %$* 389
but there's actually a very serious point behind it. %$* 389
if you look at all these different measures of economic freedom, hong kong's always near the top. %$* 389
and france, among industrialized countries, is down lower. %$* 389
and i think that is one of the reasons why hong kong grows five to six percent a year on average, and france grows one to two percent a year. %$* 389
and if we want the unemployed to get jobs, we want a strong, tight labor market like we had during the clinton years when government spending fell from 22 percent of gdp to 18 percent of gdp. %$* 389
and what happened during the reagan years when we also had more free market oriented policies. %$* 389
that, i think is the best answer. %$* 389
cecilia mentioned much earlier that clinton raised taxes on the wealthy, and things got really good. %$* 13
no. %$* 389
he-- %$* 389
clinton raised taxes, but he also did gat and nafta and welfare reform, reduced government spending by four percentage points of gdp.he deregulated telecommunications and agriculture. %$* 389
i mean, if i could take everything else of clinton's policies and it meant that i had to take the 39.6 percent marginal tax rate, i'd do it. %$* 389
we had a lot more economic freedom under clinton than we've had under bush and obama. %$* 389
okay. %$* 13
let's take another question from the audience. %$* 13
ma'am? %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
if you can stand and tell us your name. %$* 13
hi. %$* 395
my name is jane doe, and i'm proud to say i'm not from-- %$* 395
i'm not from the new york times. %$* 395
my question is for cecilia. %$* 395
by your own admission, you said that the clinton administration was able to-- %$* 395
to increase economic growth, but did so because of monetary policy. %$* 395
and even president clinton has said so on the daily show. %$* 395
my understanding is it's not the job of the president to intervene in monetary policy. %$* 395
he's admitted that he's gone into-- %$* 395
can you come to a question? %$* 13
yes. %$* 395
thanks. %$* 13
in two seconds. %$* 395
sorry. %$* 395
i paid a hundred thousand dollars to go to this university during the clinton administration, so i'd like to make my point and have her answer the question. %$* 395
okay, but other people want to speak. %$* 13
my question is about monetary policy and the clinton administration. %$* 395
i'm a democrat. %$* 395
his policies of fiscal policy did not increase economic growth. %$* 395
it was his monetary policy. %$* 395
could you comment on it? %$* 395
well, look, i think that there was a lot of good fiscal policy that happened under the clinton administration as well. %$* 390
so i'm not going to agree with your premise that it was only the monetary policy and that there was no fiscal policy under clinton. %$* 390
now, was it necessarily fiscal policy in terms of stimulus as dan has mentioned? %$* 390
there was a lot of other-- %$* 390
there was nafta.there were other attempts to stimulate economic growth. %$* 390
but-- %$* 390
no, no. %$* 13
can-- %$* 13
no, we-- %$* 13
seriously. %$* 13
and also i want to move on because we're not talking about the clinton administration. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 390
and-- %$* 13
and, sir, down in the front. %$* 13
i hope you have gotten your money's worth, though, in terms of a diploma and the whole thing. %$* 13
question for dan mitchell. %$* 18
you earlier mentioned germany. %$* 18
now, looking at this on the one side, it increases taxes for high income americans but it reduces taxes for lower income americans. %$* 18
isn't that what-- %$* 18
what has been done in germany? %$* 18
that's how you do a question. %$* 13
dan mitchell. %$* 13
as the germans would say, "der good. %$* 389
der good." what i was focusing on in my comments on germany is what happened to government spending as a share of gdp. germany did not do a big keynesian stimulus program. %$* 389
it doesn't mean that i want to embrace german fiscal policy because the overall burden of government spending is higher, actually not that much higher than it is in the u.s.they're something like 44 percent of gdp.we're getting close to 40 now after the bush-obama spending binge. %$* 389
but germany didn't do a keynesian stimulus package of any magnitude close to the u.s.and i think that served them well, similar to what happened in canada. %$* 389
now, other things were involved. %$* 389
canada never had a housing bubble. %$* 389
and of course that helped a lot. %$* 389
there's a ton of different economic policies that matter. %$* 389
but my point on germany was just a simple one, that they didn't do the keynesian policy-- %$* 389
okay, mark-- %$* 13
mark zandi would actually like a crack at that question. %$* 13
yeah, no, i was just going to make the point that the germans provided just as much fiscal support to their economy as we did in the recession. %$* 17
the difference is that in germany, they have automatic stable-- %$* 17
what's called automatic stabilizers in their budget. %$* 17
that means that there is more unemployment insurance. %$* 17
there is more welfare. %$* 17
there are-- %$* 17
the tax code is such that you generate a lot more fiscal support. %$* 17
in the u.s., we have some automatic stabilizers, but they're not nearly as large as in europe. %$* 17
and therefore, when we get into recessions, we rely more on what we're calling fiscal stimulus. %$* 17
that is temporary tax cuts and temporary spending. %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
so in terms of the fiscal support to the economy, the germans did exactly what we did in terms of the gdp. %$* 17
it's hard for me to see folks that are not in the lights, so i have to keep calling down towards the front. %$* 13
if somebody is up there, wants to take a step down, i'll try to call on you. %$* 13
but for-- %$* 13
oh, actually, yeah, so i see you standing up. %$* 13
can you come down into the-- %$* 13
walk toward the light. %$* 13
just five or six steps, and then we can see you. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
he's a tough moderator, isn't he? %$* 17
i mean he-- %$* 17
no. %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
but i do need this to be terse and, you know-- %$* 13
this addressed to the opponents who-- %$* 18
can you give-- %$* 13
sir, can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
arthur tannenbaum. %$* 396
thank you. %$* 13
from where i sit, you've been talking mostly about structural issues. %$* 396
this motion is supposed to be directed towards cyclical issue. %$* 396
so my question for you is this: isn't it a fact that we've had a number of recessions since world war ii? %$* 396
there's been some form of stimulus that was the response to each of those recessions? %$* 396
and we have always come out of these recessions and started growing again. %$* 396
thank you. %$* 13
dan mitchell. %$* 13
well, the question is-- %$* 391
okay, richard, do you want to take it? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 391
okay. %$* 13
richard epstein. %$* 13
why not? %$* 391
i mean, i think it's a fair question. %$* 391
but, of course, we always came out of them. %$* 391
we're not coming out of them now. %$* 391
so the question is, what's the source of the difference? %$* 391
and the answer is that the degree of regulation that you have with respect to the economy now has deprived it of the kind of flexibility that allows it to respond. %$* 391
and it's in all the markets thus far we've talked mainly about labor markets. %$* 391
and those are completely tied up by the kind of regulations that are put into place. %$* 391
every point and effort to try to revive the housing markets by giving mortgage support programs have turned out to be complete failures. %$* 391
the correct response on that may sound harsh, but in fact, it's the only way to get back the stability which is that banks decide to foreclose, tenants, current owners go, and the property re-circulates at lower rates so that you get the housing market start. %$* 391
you cannot keep a housing market going when essentially you allow people to remain in possession while the underlying value of the assets go down. %$* 391
so our position is really quite this. %$* 391
this stimulus program we don't think it does very much good and has already exhausted itself. %$* 391
but the mid-level regulations that you see in mortgages, in labor, in the banking industry, in the health care industry, all of these things are novel drags. %$* 391
these are discreet programs introduced by-- %$* 391
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to stop you because-- %$* 13
and those are the source of the difficulty. %$* 391
i'm going to stop you because we have to let you make you that point. %$* 13
and, sir, in the blue shirt. %$* 13
yep, if you can stand, please. %$* 13
my name is scott stevens, and i have a question for mr. %$* 397
zandi. %$* 397
you say that the $450 billion stimulus should keep us out of recession. %$* 397
could you put a number on that? %$* 397
how many percent in growth do you think we'll get from the stimulus compared to the counter factual? %$* 397
is that enough, do you think? %$* 397
and-- %$* 397
i think your answer to that is quoted on the white house blog, actually. %$* 13
yeah, it is. %$* 17
i haven't had a chance to read that. %$* 397
yeah. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 17
which, as i said earlier, means it's right, right? %$* 17
so, mark, why don't you take that question? %$* 13
put-- %$* 13
do you have something else you'd like to say? %$* 17
i'd like to keep it as a one-part-- %$* 13
it's enough and-- %$* 397
yeah. %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
considering that it's being paid for too, that'd take a lot of the growth away from it. %$* 397
right. %$* 17
and while you're at it-- %$* 397
no, no. %$* 13
that's good. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
yes, and the cardinals will win the world series, yes. %$* 17
you like that, huh? %$* 17
well, if you do the arithmetic, the math, under current policy, if there is no change in policy, federal fiscal policy will shave 1.7 percentage points from gdp growth in 2012. state and local governments’ cuts will take the total fiscal drag-- %$* 17
this is the headwind to the economy-- %$* 17
to two percentage points of gdp.the obama jobs package provides stimulus equal to two percent of gdp.so the intent is to neutralize the fiscal drag. %$* 17
now, you know, if i were king for the day, i'd say, you know, we can digest some fiscal austerity. %$* 17
we don't have to go the whole monty here, but we need to do something. %$* 17
we can't just-- %$* 17
we're not going to be able to digest two percentage points %$* 17
all right. %$* 13
so you were very specific. %$* 13
i want to go to the other side and say that he was very specific. %$* 13
well, there's a certain beauty to being exact about something. %$* 389
but if you go back and look at what mark was saying in 2010 and what mark was saying in 2009 and what mark was saying in 2008, and then you compare those things to reality, they're always different than what actually happened. %$* 389
now, of course, mark will say, but other things happened in the economy. %$* 389
no, no, i think i got it right. %$* 17
but i think this gets at the problem that when you have a model that presupposes the results, mark has a model and if you put in the certain amount of government spending, that will automatically spit out a certain number of gdp unemployment, probably depending on how it's spent. %$* 389
i'm sure there are some greater details to it. %$* 389
cpo has the same model, and these are the kinds of models that gave us the white house, i guess, transition team document that said if we squandered $850 billion, our unemployment rate would never go above eight percent, and it just didn't work. %$* 389
it doesn't matter how many decimals you have in your estimate. %$* 389
if the fundamental underlying premise is wrong, it doesn't work. %$* 389
okay, on that-- %$* 13
you're not giving me a chance to respond to that, john? %$* 17
what's that all about? %$* 17
you're going to say you were right. %$* 13
okay, all right. %$* 17
that's really why i'm not coming back. %$* 13
you're going to say you were right. %$* 13
and down the front? %$* 13
hi, my name is giovan jucovovic i would like to ask a question to the opponent to this. %$* 398
you seem to be presenting a broader and more long term vision for what you think with deregulation and whatnot. %$* 398
i would like to know how your plan of deregulation in general in the economy would benefit americans besides the wealthiest of americans and what specifically this would do by creating, like you say, abolishing minimum wage, creating low paying jobs, how would this really benefit americans as a whole and not just the top one percent? %$* 398
and how soon? %$* 13
the top one percent-- %$* 391
richard epstein. %$* 13
first of all, with respect to the top one percent, i think one ought to look at some of the numbers. %$* 391
the amount of revenue that has been collected from the top one percent in the last-- %$* 391
from 2007 to 2009 declined by about 30 percent, so that what you're trying to do is to hit a top figure and assume that nothing you could do to them can hurt them. %$* 391
they have been hurt in terms of the money they have very much. %$* 391
oh, laugh, if you may, but remember, 40 percent of that goes into your tax revenues. %$* 391
so every time, what you do is you cut the revenue at the top, you cut the revenue for the programs that are needed to support the stimulus. %$* 391
dream on if you think that you can avoid that kind of situation. %$* 391
if you reduce income at the top, you reduce the amount of money available for transfer %$* 391
mark zandi, do you-- %$* 13
at the bottom, what you have to do is if you reduce these things, you would get people on the job ladder. %$* 391
the moment they are on the job ladder because employers now find it in their interest, they will advance. %$* 391
when you look at-- %$* 391
for example if people could get in at minimum wage jobs, typically within six months or less they have managed to promote themselves to another type of job. %$* 391
this can take place immediately, but it will not take place by employers unless they have some confidence in the long term stability of the system. %$* 391
every major tax measure that we have now has a two-year timeframe on it so that the uncertainty dominates in my judgment the kinds of stimulus that you hope to get by the spending policy. %$* 391
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are-- %$* 13
we're about to hear a brief closing statement from each debater in turn, they will be two minutes each, uninterrupted. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate, because this is their last chance to try to persuade you to vote for their arguments at the end, and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round three. %$* 13
these are closing statements from each debater in turn, two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this, "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to summarize his position against this motion, daniel mitchell, senior fellow at the cato institute. %$* 13
congress should not pass the president's job proposal either in its entirety or piece by piece because it represents a fundamentally misguided view of the economy, that you can make yourself richer by taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other. %$* 389
i think the historical evidence, the cross-country evidence does not support the keynesian theory. %$* 389
but more importantly, i think good long run policy is good short run policy. %$* 389
i want to try to get back the labor market conditions we had under reagan and clinton, and the one common characteristic of what we had under both reagan and clinton was that economic freedom in america broadly defined-- %$* 389
so we're not just talking the fiscal policy, but more than just fiscal policy affects the economy-- %$* 389
economic freedom in america increased during the reagan years and the clinton years, by contrast, economic freedom declined during the bush years, and that decline has continued during the obama years. %$* 389
and if we accept-- %$* 389
even if we don't like it, if we accept the notion that jobs are only created when employers think that it's going to be profitable to create those jobs, we need to figure out what type of economic conditions will lead to that greater prosperity. %$* 389
and, again, i come back to what originally was a joke line, but i really want to make a premise, why is it that an economy like hong kong manages to grow so fast over such a long period of time, it takes in enormous amounts of immigrants, people rise from poverty to prosperity relatively quickly. %$* 389
that’s the kind of economy i want to mimic. %$* 389
not because i care about the top one percent. %$* 389
the top one percent have never really, i don’t know, maybe some of them gave to the cato institute, so if you’re out there listening, i love you. %$* 389
but i care a lot more about the people at the bottom than at the top. %$* 389
if there’s a recession, the donald trumps and warren buffetts and bill gates of the world never have to worry about how their household budget is going to be balanced. %$* 389
that’s why i want to copy hong kong. %$* 389
in france, the rich people have figured how to work it; i don’t care about them. %$* 389
thank you. %$* 389
thank you daniel mitchell. %$* 13
our motion, "congress should pass obama’s job plan piece by piece" and here to summarize his position for the motion, mark zandi, chief economist at moody’s analytics. %$* 13
thank you john. %$* 17
i want to thank you for the opportunity again. %$* 17
and i commend the other group for articulating their views so thoughtfully. %$* 17
i sympathize with a lot of what’s being said by the other group. %$* 17
i do think that the economy is encumbered by regulatory, legal uncertainty. %$* 17
we have made some major changes to our economy, to our health care system, to our banking system. %$* 17
and these are difficult things for businesses and individuals to adjust to. %$* 17
and i do think we need to work hard in reducing that regulatory and legal uncertainty. %$* 17
and we do need to take steps to address our long-term problems. %$* 17
again i think it’s vital that we work to achieve fiscal sustainability, to get the long term deficits down so that our nation doesn’t go the way of europe or france. %$* 17
i think tax reform is absolutely vital. %$* 17
i think it’s key to bring down the tax expenditures, the tax credits and deductions in the tax code, make the tax code much fairer, simpler. %$* 17
i think our economy would be better for it. %$* 17
and i actually am quite optimistic about our economic prospects. %$* 17
i think, as i said earlier, we have come a long way. %$* 17
our economy has righted a lot of the wrongs that got us to this point. %$* 17
we’re really very close. %$* 17
we just cannot go back into recession in the near future. %$* 17
that would be damaging, the collective psyche is on edge. %$* 17
you’re nervous; i’m nervous; we’re all very frazzled. %$* 17
recession will just tip us over. %$* 17
the obama jobs package, even if it’s passed in small parts, would go a long way to ensuring that we don’t go back into recession and that bright economic future actually will be upon us i think sooner than we realize. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
thank you mark zandi. %$* 13
our motion, "congress should pass obama’s jobs plan piece by piece," and here to summarize his position against this motion, richard epstein, professor at the new york university school of law. %$* 13
yes, i think what happens is everybody agrees on the importance of trying to get both short term and long term proposals. %$* 391
my view about this is, if we do not make long-term structural returns and make them soon, the stimulus program will not succeed. %$* 391
the most that you could get out of this is six or nine months. %$* 391
after that time, the long term structures will remain and you will fall into a recession that might be deeper than one that you take today. %$* 391
so what is it that you have to do? %$* 391
you have to try to figure out why it is that in the last 10 years it has been a lost decade in terms of economic growth. %$* 391
and the answer is not that the stimulus program does or does not work. %$* 391
it is because all on mid-level institutions are inferior to what they were at an earlier time. %$* 391
the labor markets have become much more regulated. %$* 391
the banking industry has become much more concentrated at this particular point. %$* 391
dodd-frank will introduce all sorts of layers of confusion. %$* 391
the health care bill is a huge drain with respect to potential resources because the unemployment uncertainty is associated with the mandate and everything else are in fact going to wield a very heavy load on this system. %$* 391
the question is when will this load be bourn? %$* 391
the answer is it will be bourn today. %$* 391
there is no way in effect that you can change the situation in the future if in fact you do not change the system correctly today. %$* 391
employers and everybody else in this economy has rational expectations which don’t only look at the short periods, they look at the long periods. %$* 391
so if we start talking about stimulus programs which have never worked, what happens is we’re just going to add another layer of uncertainty on top of the layer of regulation. %$* 391
and we’ll be worse off than we are before. %$* 391
the question then is, will liberalization work? %$* 391
and the answer is if you engage in a systematic program of retrenchment and repeal, these things in fact will take effect immediately and you will start to see some kind of reversal. %$* 391
we do have a serious problem. %$* 391
we must do something. %$* 391
but if we think of the economy as being somebody with a diabetic shock, we ought not to add fix it, add to it some sugar. %$* 391
thank you richard epstein. %$* 13
the motion "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to summarize her position in support of the motion, cecilia rouse, professor of economics at princeton university. %$* 13
so i do believe that congress should pass the obama jobs plan. %$* 390
i too am concerned about the impact of employer mandates on labor markets and believe we should be very judicious in looking at regulation. %$* 390
i think we should only put into place regulations where the benefits clearly exceed the costs. %$* 390
i think the evidence isn't really there that minimum wage is such an egregious regulation. %$* 390
but that would be another debate. %$* 390
however, if the clinton administration in the clinton years were such an example of economic freedom, in 2001, we had a recession where we had a jobless recovery. %$* 390
so what happened? %$* 390
did the regulatory environment magically change with an election? %$* 390
i think that what we have is-- %$* 390
what that tells us is that this regulatory environment is not going to address the cyclical changes. %$* 390
and i think we have a cyclical challenge right now. %$* 390
and so i think it's appropriate for the congress to step in. %$* 390
now, as i said from the outset, i think one of the most important pieces of this is one that's a tax relief for employees. %$* 390
i think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is very important as well. %$* 390
i just want to add to that that congress has always extended these benefits during times of recession. %$* 390
and the reason is clear. %$* 390
it's pennywise and pound foolish not to do so. %$* 390
if workers and their families aren't supported, they're going to end up on other government programs. %$* 390
and so congress-- %$* 390
even reagan did not stop supporting unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent. %$* 390
so i think congress typically steps in during times of recession. %$* 390
i think there are good economic reasons for it to do so. %$* 390
and i think this is one of those times. %$* 390
more importantly, you know, as mark has said very carefully, we really do risk falling into another recession which will be just devastating for all of us. %$* 390
might doing nothing make a difference? %$* 390
it might work. %$* 390
but i've got to tell you, i'm not a gambling girl, and i'm just not willing to make that gamble for 42 million workers who are out of work and the millions more who are really suffering economically. %$* 390
thank you. %$* 390
thank you, cecilia rouse. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and that means it's time to find out which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we want to go again-- %$* 13
we want to ask you again to go to the keyboards at your seat and to register your vote for the team that you feel presented the best argument on this motion: "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece." if you feel that the side arguing for the motion has argued best, push number one. %$* 13
if you feel that the side arguing against the motion has argued best, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in about one minute and 17 seconds, actually. %$* 13
come up quite shortly. %$* 13
yes, yeah. %$* 13
so while that's happening, i just want to-- %$* 13
i just want to say thanks to this panel for-- %$* 13
for the level of debate they brought to this and-- %$* 13
for the spirit and the style and the humor and the intelligence. %$* 13
and to everybody who got up and asked a question, the questions were pretty good tonight, so i want to thank you for having the nerve to stand up and ask the questions. %$* 13
we really do appreciate it. %$* 13
and to everybody who is out there watching on slate, thank you to as well. %$* 13
so our final debate of the season will be on tuesday, november 15th. %$* 13
and the motion that we're debating is this: "the world would be better off without religion." arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
arguing for the motion, the great, great grandson of charles darwin whose name tragically is not darwin because that would be-- %$* 13
his name is matthew chapman. %$* 13
he is an author, and he is a filmmaker, and he's cofounder of science debate. %$* 13
his debating partner is a.c.grayling. %$* 13
he is a renowned philosopher, humanist and an atheist who recently authored a book called "the good book: a secular bible,” a manifesto for rational thought. %$* 13
on the other side of that debate, we're going to have dinesh d’souza who is the president of the king's college and author of "what's so great about christianity? %$* 13
" and rabbi david wolpe who was named one of the most influential rabbis in america by newsweek. %$* 13
we'll be announcing our spring topics next month. %$* 13

it's good to have you all breathing and speaking and voicing your opinions. %$* 13
so thank you. %$* 13
it really gives a sense of life to it. %$* 13
you're also on television here in new york city on wnet13 and wliw and njtv.all right, now, it's all in. %$* 13
we've had two teams arguing out this motion: "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece." you voted twice, once before the debate to tell us where you stood on it, and again at the end of the debate after listening to these teams try to persuade you to their point of view. %$* 13
we've asked you to choose which team argued the best. %$* 13
here is the result. %$* 13
before the debate on this motion, "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece," 45 percent were for the motion, 16 percent against, and 39 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 69 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that is up 24 percent. %$* 13
22 percent are against, that's up only six percent. %$* 13
30 percent-- %$* 13
nine percent are undecided. %$* 13
that's down 30 percent. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion that congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece carries the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you for me, john donvan. %$* 13
and we'll see you next time. %$* 13

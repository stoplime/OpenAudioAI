however, it still has stuffed ducks-style education where people are taught to memorize, not to think for themselves and not to analyze. %$* 177
the world, the world comes to america as long as we give them the visas to have the best in the world education system. %$* 177
we can absorb the brains of the world and stay ahead of anybody in the world. %$* 177
um finally, i'm looking at my opponents here. %$* 177
i'm on the good guys team here on the left and uh, my opponents here, these are all learned men, they’re all phds. %$* 177
but take a look, there’s not a bit of suntan on any of those heads. %$* 177
um they have, they have been sitting in offices in washington and chicago um, reading reports and putting together the world under, under theories. %$* 177
and that’s quite good, i'm happy to say that. %$* 177
and i'm not here, i'm not here to defend china. %$* 177
i'm here to defend america because um, if you say that we can’t handle the rise of china um, then you're voting against america tonight. %$* 177
i believe that you really have to vote no because if you vote yes, then you're voting against america. %$* 177
america can handle the rise of china. %$* 177
china’s got a lot of problems. %$* 177
and we’re going to, we’ve, we’ve handled many things in, in the life of this country. %$* 177
and we will handle this quite well. %$* 177
thank you very much. %$* 177
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america jim mcgregor, thank you very much. %$* 171
now uh, before we turn to the uh, q&a uh, part of the evening, i just wanted to let you know how you all voted um, before the uh, debate began. %$* 171
um, before the debate, and i’ll just remind you, the motion is, “beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america.” before the debate began, you voted 41.05 percent of you, 41 percent of you voted for the motion, 37.4 percent voted against the motion, and 21.5 percent said you were undecided. %$* 171
so quite a thin margin for the sun-drenched team against the motion to sway them. %$* 171
before we get started, i thought i’d abuse my position as a moderator here to just ask a couple of questions. %$* 171
and i guess i uh, wanted to start by um, directing a question at john mearsheimer. %$* 171
um you couldn't help but feel, feel that michael pillsbury gave the game away a little bit when he said, you know, on our side of the motion, we don’t need to be alarmist, we don’t need to talk about war. %$* 171
and yet, within a few minutes’ time, you were saying, the u.s.will not tolerate a situation where china tries to dominate asia. %$* 171
and i guess my question is, to you, how does china have a hope of fulfilling its promise of a peaceful rise if people like you are standing up and saying we will not tolerate china that seeks to dominate the region in which it lives? %$* 171
is this not just warmongering that is dressed as prudence? %$* 171
and uh, i have a question i uh, also – i, i have a question rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america uh, out to stapleton roy um, which is listening to you, you can’t help but fear that, that your position is, is don’t worry be happy. %$* 171
uh, we have a politically unstable superpower with a foreign policy that is unclear even to itself. %$* 171
and clearly that is going to, at the very least, threaten u.s.preeminence in the world. %$* 171
and i guess my question to you is looking back over the last thirty years, even if you take into account the benefits of engagement, has not commercial engagement with china made it more difficult for the u.s. to engage on issues from tibet to taiwan? %$* 171
and how much will the u.s. be forced to compromise its foreign policy positions in, if it’s going to ignore the threat that china poses? %$* 171
so first to address, mearsheimer. %$* 171
uh, the question of whether or not china can rise peacefully is a somewhat different question than the one that is on the table, and there’s no question, as our moderator said, that i’ve bumped into the question of whether china can rise peacefully. %$* 176
now he said in effect, aren’t i creating a self-fulfilling prophecy here, because china wants to rise peacefully in the story uh, but yet the united states, because it’s being prudent, is creating a situation where you’ll have a clash down the road. %$* 176
it’s not uh, necessarily that you’ll have a shooting war. %$* 176
but you’ll certainly have an intense security competition as a result of my story. %$* 176
there’s no question about that with the possibility of the war. %$* 176
my rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america argument is that the united states really has no choice. %$* 176
because as china gets more and more powerful economically, the united states constantly bumps into the question of what china’s intentions will be ten, twenty, or thirty years down the road. %$* 176
and he says, the moderator, that china wants to rise peacefully. %$* 176
but he can’t assure me that china wants to rise peacefully or will rise peacefully. %$* 176
there’s just no way of knowing. %$* 176
and in a world where you have a state that’s becoming increasingly powerful, nearly as powerful as you, you have to assume worst case about its intentions to protect yourself in case there is trouble. %$* 176
because as i said to you before, if you do get into trouble, there’s no 911 that you can appeal to. %$* 176
and in a very important way, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and this is why i titled the book that i wrote on this subject, the tragedy of great-power politics. %$* 176
this is a tragic situation. %$* 176
the united states simply has no choice but to assume the worst about china and the end result is that you’ll get that for sure. %$* 176
and on that happy note, stapleton roy. %$* 171
i spent my career as a diplomat and somehow the world wasn’t this hobbesian picture that has been presented to us. %$* 173
just think about it for a moment. %$* 173
if your goal is to keep everybody else down, you shouldn't be surprised to discover that nobody else rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america shares that goal. %$* 173
now successful foreign policies are based on finding common interests with other countries, not in trying to keep them down. %$* 173
if we try to keep china down, we’ll have to keep india down or whoever the next person is. %$* 173
what kind of a foreign policy and kind of a country are, are we if that’s our approach? %$* 173
think of it in another way. %$* 173
if our goal is to ensure the security and prosperity of the american people, in a world in which other countries have an equal right, if they can do so responsibly, to improve the prosperity and security of their people, then we have a world in which there are common goals, and which other countries can also raise the living standards of their people and meet their security needs better. %$* 173
the goal then of our foreign policy is responsible behavior in the international community. %$* 173
that’s a shared goal with most other countries and it’s an achievable goal. %$* 173
but it requires that we also set a good example. %$* 173
now remember also the western hemisphere is the only region of the world in which one power can be the hegemony. %$* 173
china is surrounded by japan that has a conventional military capable, that’s equal to china’s. %$* 173
it’s surrounded by russia, a nuclear power, by india, a nuclear power. %$* 173
by vietnam which is no patsy, by korea which is no patsy, and the united states is a permanent factor in the region. %$* 173
chinese leaders do not spend their time thinking about dominating asia through power. %$* 173
the way that they are increasing our influence is through influence. %$* 173
they’re rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america reassuring their neighbors. %$* 173
they’re behaving in a way which leaves the southeast asian countries in the lead in promoting an east asian community, not china. %$* 173
so it’s the country that throws its weight around that loses influence. %$* 173
and the country that uses its influence to promote its interest that is doing so more effectively. %$* 173
we ought to learn something from this. %$* 173
we are actually very good at playing this game when we realize that we cannot accomplish our goals or keep a peaceful world if we rely on power as opposed to the right balance of power and influence. %$* 173
we certainly need to keep ourselves strong enough so a rising china does not threaten our prosperity and our security. %$* 173
but we don’t need to do so in a world where we have to keep everybody else down because of a threat to our hegemonic position. %$* 173
thank you. %$* 171
may i, may i just say i still consider ambassador roy to be the fourth member of our team. %$* 174
thank you, thank you very much for those comments. %$* 174
a balance of power is in fact the right approach. %$* 174
michael pillsbury is uh, is being a dissident. %$* 171
uh, within the process, we uh, you know, need to keep the lines of the left and right absolutely clear here. %$* 171
now we get to the interesting bit rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america which is uh, over to you. %$* 171
uh, what i’d like to do is uh, ask you to um, uh, you know, come forth with questions for the panel. %$* 171
please make clear who you're directing them to. %$* 171
please, if you wouldn't mind, stand up when you ask a question. %$* 171
um if you're a member of the press, would you say so? %$* 171
and would you identify yourself. %$* 171
and one final thing, would you do what i didn’t, which is keep your questions short and succinct. %$* 171
right, there are two people here. %$* 171
there are people with mics, two up, two up at the front here. %$* 171
thanks very much. %$* 171
this lady right in the middle. %$* 171
um, hi, and my name is lily um, for john mearsheimer. %$* 178
uh, you say that we should want to maintain superiority to china, but just as the part of the fabric of america, shouldn’t we also want to concern ourselves with the human rights and the, uh, conditions in china? %$* 178
actually, uh, john mearsheimer, if you don’t mind, we’re going to take a couple of questions, two or three together, and then we’re going to go on. %$* 171
thank you very much. %$* 171
so there’s a gentleman over here who has a question. %$* 171
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america %$* 171
uh, yeah, my name is mike endacott um, this question is for daniel rosen. %$* 179
um, does the example of hong kong, and uh, china’s before towards hong kong give us any clear picture of their future intentions? %$* 179
thank you very much. %$* 171
let’s start with those two, john mearsheimer, should we not pay more attention to human rights than just our own interests? %$* 171
the point that i tried to make in my comments was that the state can have a variety of different interests, and promoting human rights, or protecting human rights and promoting democracy can be, and often are legitimate goals of states, especially the united states. %$* 176
but the highest goal always has to be, uh, protecting your security, maintaining your survival. %$* 176
and the point that i tried to make clear here is that the best way to maximize your chances of surviving in the system are to make sure that you are by far the most powerful state, because then nobody can fool around with you. %$* 176
and once you have ensured your survival, you are of course then free to pursue those other goals. %$* 176
thank you. %$* 171
daniel rosen, what does hong kong tell us? %$* 171
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america hong kong tells us a lot. %$* 175
uh, the, the motion we’re debating tonight, with regard to the meta-phenomenon of china’s strengthening, uh, and coming back into a position, uh, of relative strength after a century of relative weakness could easily have been debated in the more narrow context of hong kong ten years ago. %$* 175
about ten years ago today, in fact, uh, almost. %$* 175
uh, or, or a month away. %$* 175
uh, people assuming that china’s reassumption of control over hong kong would necessarily bring, uh, a cauldron of concerns and troubles about hong kong’s fate. %$* 175
in fact, uh, things have played out entirely differently than that. %$* 175
uh, china has left hong kong to manage its own affairs, in the same way at beijing, to a great extent, is allowing many regions of the country within mainland china to manage their own affairs. %$* 175
probably too much so. %$* 175
we probably need a stronger beijing rather than a weaker one, in fact. %$* 175
uh, hong kong is prospering. %$* 175
its success or failure stands on its own competitiveness. %$* 175
this is precisely what we should learn form the situation. %$* 175
hong kong can do better or worse, it has less to do with beijing than it does to do with hong kong. %$* 175
the united states can benefit or be at a relative loss as a result of china’s economic growth. %$* 175
it has everything to do with the choices we make, and how we choose to respond, instead of trying to adjust our game to respond to what china wants to do instead. %$* 175
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america thank you very much. %$* 171
right, yeah, the two gentleman, just up, uh, then let’s take a couple of, uh, questions from you two please. %$* 171
uh, and then, uh, i saw there’s someone right up at the back. %$* 171
thank you. %$* 171
thank you. %$* 179
my name is gerry ohrstrom given frederic bastiat’s empirically proven statement where goods cross borders, armies won’t, i’d like to ask the friendly mr. %$* 179
pillsbury if he truly believes that a wealthy china poses a greater threat to america and to the world and to the region than an impoverished china. %$* 179
others, i think mr. %$* 179
hilsh-, mearsheimer clearly an-, answered that question. %$* 179
i’d like to get your direct answer. %$* 179
thank you very much. %$* 171
so the gentleman in the back. %$* 171
hi. %$* 179
uh, i guess this is for mr. %$* 179
mearsheimer. %$* 179
he was saying that the, the uh, military strength is the key to controlling china, but it seems that we can’t really do anything in iraq to control iraq. %$* 179
how are we ever gonna control china? %$* 179
and really, economically, since they have trillions of dollars pouring into their country, and we’re running a major, major deficit, how would we ever possibly finance a military that could overcome china? %$* 179
i mean, they have so much more money in the bank now, and it seems like in the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america foreseeable future, that’s going to be the case. %$* 179
so shouldn’t we focus on being economic partners with them and trading partners as ambassador roy said, and seek common ground rather than sort of pursue this military concept, which isn’t working anywhere for us? %$* 179
thank you. %$* 171
and the gentleman here in the bow tie please. %$* 171
uh, my question also is to mr. %$* 179
mearsheimer. %$* 179
um, so-, sorry to pile on you, but um, why do you believe contrary to, uh, every example in recorded history that the united states can continue, uh, to be the most powerful nation in the world? %$* 179
and in what way are the citizens of those countries which used to be the most powerful nations in the world, sweden, the netherlands, great britain, uh, any worser off now that they are no longer citizens of the most powerful nation in the world? %$* 179
thank you for that very understanding question. %$* 171
uh let, let’s um, let’s start first, uh, though with the question, uh, for michael pillsbury about a, a wealthy china surely being better for america and the world than an impoverished one. %$* 171
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america %$* 171
uh, i prefer a wealthy china to a poor, angry china. %$* 174
uh, i think the, the issue though %$* 174
i think michael just joined our side. %$* 8
it’s about time. %$* 180
it’s an even trade. %$* 8
state department’s always thinking the allies. %$* 180
i think the issue is really democracy, and a wealthy democratic china is a better partner for us, a better ally, a better friend than a poor, than even a poor democratic china. %$* 174
the problem is how to get from here to there without being foolishly naïve in building up china’s economic strength in a way that they also maintain their nationalism. %$* 174
they maintain their anti-american views, and they, uh, it ends, the situation ends up that we have been gullible and naïve over a fifteen or twenty year period. %$* 174
and this has happened before. %$* 174
if you read john mearsheimer’s most recent rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america book, it really chronicles a number of times this has happened in world politics. %$* 174
so if you really want to support our side of the resolution, you need to be thinking about this phrase the moderator used, which i love, i think he’s working for us too, “don’t worry, be happy.” because that’s what their side really is advocating. %$* 174
what i am saying, be wary in the following four or five ways. %$* 174
we need to continue our military exchange program with the chinese military, and let them see that we’re not their enemy. %$* 174
we don’t want to call that off because “don’t worry be happy.” we need to continue the embargo on arms sales to china. %$* 174
we shouldn’t sell weapons to china. %$* 174
we should continue the eur-, our support that the european union has its embargo on arms sales to china, until human rights improves significantly. %$* 174
we should continue to do something about taiwan’s defense. %$* 174
we don’t have to arm them to the teeth, but we shouldn’t just walk away from taiwan. %$* 174
and finally, we need to have technology limits on our most advanced technology that we transfer to china. %$* 174
right now, it’s very generous, but there are a few things we hold back, and some people say that was part of their successful test against the satellite in space, is that they had some western technology, uh, at their, at their service. %$* 174
and frankly, i don’t know if all of you know as, perhaps as civilians, ninety percent of your military forces go through satellites. %$* 174
communications, intelligence, also and every time you use an rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america atm card, that’s a satellite conveyed transaction. %$* 174
so we are a highly vulnerable society with our four hundred satellites in space. %$* 174
this test is very serious in january, and the chinese government after repeated requests has no explanation for it. %$* 174
they just say, “oh, don’t worry about it. %$* 174
don’t worry, be happy.” %$* 174
thank you very much %$* 171
let me see if there’s %$* 175
we’ll come back in one moment. %$* 171
just to john mearsheimer, could you take on both of those questions, essentially the question of whether or not american hegemony should or can afford to continue forever? %$* 171
yeah. %$* 176
you, you wanna let daniel %$* 176
no, no, go ahead, john mearsheimer, and then we’ll turn to daniel rosen in a moment. %$* 171
oh, very quickly, on all three questions. %$* 176
the first one said where goods cross borders, armies don’t. %$* 176
uh, i think that’s empirically wrong, and there was a tremendous amount of economic rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america interdependence in europe before world war i, uh, and world war i still happened. %$* 176
and if you look at german-soviet relations in 1941, there was actually a tremendous amount of economic intercourse, and yet you still had, uh, world war ii.and during the cold war, in fact, you had hardly any economic intercourse between the united states and the soviet union, and nevertheless you never had a shooting war. %$* 176
now on the question of whether or not we could possibly contain china, uh, which gets into two other questions that i was asked, uh, and the person pointed out, how could we possibly contain china when we can’t even deal with iraq? %$* 176
uh, i would vote that going to war in iraq was a completely crazy idea from the beginning, and whether or not you can fight the war in iraq is a very different issue than whether you can contain china down the road. %$* 176
and the analogy i would point to that makes this quite obvious is our experience in vietnam, and at the same time our experience containing and defeating the soviet union during the cold war. %$* 176
the vietnam war, like the iraq war was a completely cockamamie idea. %$* 176
uh, but nevertheless, the united states, even though it lost in vietnam still won the cold war. %$* 176
uh, and there no question that the united states should avoid, should avoid fighting iraqs down the road. %$* 176
but it clearly has the wherewithal, uh, to uh, finance the defenses to, to contain china down the road. %$* 176
and this gets to the final question, which is, can the united rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america states remain number one forever, and if we don’t, we’ll be, will we be that badly off? %$* 176
uh, first of all, nothing is forever, so the united states is not going to remain number one forever. %$* 176
but i would be willing to bet a lot of money that the united states is actually more powerful relative to the rest of the world over the course of this century, largely for demographic reasons, uh, than it is right now. %$* 176
uh, a lot of the doomsayers, who say that the united states is in real trouble down the road are simply wrong, in my opinion. %$* 176
and i think a powerful case can be made contrary to what we’re talking about up here that china won’t rise, uh, anywhere near as much as many people think it will. %$* 176
and getting into the final points, are we worse off, or we will be worse off not being so powerful? %$* 176
look at the europeans. %$* 176
well, if you look at europe in recent times, that’s true. %$* 176
but let’s go back to 1900 and think about being a pole anywhere from 1900 to 2007.think about growing up in france anytime between 1900 and 2007.yeah, the last few decades have been pretty good, uh, but if you look at the broader sweep of history, it looks mighty nasty. %$* 176
and who’s to tell what the future looks like, many of you assume that it’s gonna be peace, love and forever, right, i mean europe has been pacified, war has been burned out of europe. %$* 176
maybe, maybe not. %$* 176
i’m just a very prudent person. %$* 176
i don’t like to take chances. %$* 176
and that means that i just prefer to be much more powerful rather than as powerful as rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america the other states in the system. %$* 176
right thank you very much, john mearsheimer. %$* 171
a very quick response from daniel rosen. %$* 171
this is gonna start to sound like a george bernard shaw play, but i’m with pillsbury. %$* 175
uh, a, a wealthy democratic china is clearly in the u.s.interest. %$* 175
be wary of arguments that you can foster democracy in china by stymieing the boom. %$* 175
a boom doesn’t guarantee democratization. %$* 175
a bust guarantees that you will not get there. %$* 175
that can be said pretty clearly. %$* 175
and we already see early evidence of democratization processes starting to take place. %$* 175
people elect their own co-op boards. %$* 175
they decide who represents them in their parent-teacher associations in their schools. %$* 175
this is happening already. %$* 175
and everybody who’s been stymieing china sees it manifested. %$* 175
thank you very much. %$* 171
right, a few more questions. %$* 171
and, uh, i don’t want this new york audience to get a bad reputation, so if anyone wants to throw a punch at the side that’s against the motion, please feel free. %$* 171
the gentleman here on the left. %$* 171
i’ll see what i can do. %$* 179
um, uh, if we held this debate, uh, twenty rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america years ago, you’d probably insert japan for china. %$* 179
uh, at that time, and, and we see that that kind of played out a different way, despite what michael crichton might think. %$* 179
um, that said, how does japan kind of enter into the debate here? %$* 179
i mean, if you think about it, um, there is some, uh, scholarship or some theory that suggests that we should think about japan as a bulwark against a rising china, and i’d like to get fielder’s choice from the panelists, what, how do they think japan, um, plays in, you know, in terms of the constitution, in terms of rearmament. %$* 179
how can they pl-, play a constructive role in perhaps bringing some coma-, accommodation in asia? %$* 179
thank you very much. %$* 171
and, uh, the gentleman up there in the blue shirt? %$* 171
thanks. %$* 179
this is for the speakers against the motion. %$* 179
um, you had said that china has no ideology, and yet if a booming china means that u.s.is increasingly dependant on china, and yet china has shown it’s ab-, um, it’s interest in supporting rogue or failed states, such as sudan. %$* 179
and yet because of our dependence on china we’re-, that inhibits our ability to intervene in those situations, how would you respond to that? %$* 179
thank you very much. %$* 171
let’s uh, we’ll come to you in one rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america moment. %$* 171
uh, let’s start, jim mcgregor, do you want to deal with uh, japan? %$* 171
and who’d like to deal with uh, china’s role in sudan? %$* 171
let’s start with japan. %$* 171
well no, i, i wanna address where he talks about us being dependant on china. %$* 177
who’s dependant on whom here? %$* 177
look at the eco-, i mean, no one’s talking about the chinese people and the economic times. %$* 177
china’s oil companies, china’s banks, china’s telecom companies are all listed on overseas stock exchanges. %$* 177
they’re, they’re, they were the second biggest buyers of u.s.treasuries. %$* 177
they’re completely tied into us, we’re not, we’re not dependant on china in any, in any way shape or form. %$* 177
we’re tied together, which is for the common good. %$* 177
a country that is tied together that deeply and economically and we’re, and the, the amount of jobs that are created by the consumers in america, by the foreign companies, sixty-some percent of exports from china come from foreign companies. %$* 177
so we’re so intertwined, uh, it, it just brings more stability. %$* 177
but jim mcgregor, doesn’t this question cut to exactly that problem? %$* 171
we’re having two debates here this evening. %$* 171
on the right hand side, you have people who are talking about foreign policy and national security. %$* 171
and on the left hand side, we have people talking about economic growth and commercial rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america opportunity. %$* 171
and actually when you, when it, you come to it, when you look at a case like sudan, when you look at china’s involvement in zimbabwe, actually we’re failing to address or engage china in constructive diplomatic, uh, you know, work around the world. %$* 171
well if you look at, what have we done? %$* 177
china now is awash with money, and they’re looking to invest overseas. %$* 177
when they came to buy unocal, uh, which pumped i think point eight percent of american oil, congress looked at this at a national security threat and pushed them away. %$* 177
and we’ve pushed middle east out of chin-, out of the u.s.already, they’re going to china. %$* 177
china’s now going out in the world to invest and we’re starting to push them away. %$* 177
this isn’t, this isn’t, uh, this isn’t the philistines of the business community against the honorable people of the ph.d.world. %$* 177
this is commercial reality versus theory. %$* 177
thank you very much. %$* 171
uh, f-, a couple more questions, the lady up here, on the right hand side, middle of, down the, down here. %$* 171
and there’s a gentleman, uh, mauve shirt in the middle. %$* 171
hi, my name is jolie hunt this is for james mcgregor. %$* 178
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america speaking of commercial realities, i’m very surprised that censorship hasn’t come up, uh, especially as we’re against this motion. %$* 178
and it doesn’t seem like we’re, we’re comparing apples to apples here, it’s more like bullets to grenades. %$* 178
and if we have to act like responsible citizens, how can we not, uh, pay attention when china doesn’t. %$* 178
so, so the question comes to censorship and the notion that, uh, companies like google and yahoo, uh, have to, uh, make restrictions in news and information there and, and how can we compete with them in, in saying that america can take it? %$* 178
it seems to be rather naïve. %$* 178
you’re not allowed to answer that. %$* 8
thank you. %$* 171
hmm? %$* 171
you’re not allowed to answer that. %$* 8
this uh, gentleman here? %$* 171
um, hi. %$* 179
my name is john silverman. %$* 179
can you hear me? %$* 179
yeah. %$* 171
this is for any one of the gentlemen against the motion. %$* 181
here’s rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america my question. %$* 181
china’s ability to bring, uh, produce goods for far less than america has cost untold numbers of our citizens to lose their job. %$* 181
doesn’t that mean that the china boom has already caused trouble for america? %$* 181
thank you very much. %$* 171
um, who’d like to start with that question, jim mcgregor do you want to talk about the outsourcing problem? %$* 171
uh, no, i’ll talk about censorship, because that’s i’m, i’m in the media. %$* 177
ok, ok, you’re gonna, do-, dan, ok, let’s start, uh, daniel rosen with outsourcing. %$* 171
and we’re gonna have to keep it relatively short, i’m afraid. %$* 171
right, uh, the um, automobile industry was a terrible, terrible threat to the horse and buggy industry here in new york city. %$* 175
in fact, there’s practically, we’re down to about a hundred people in horse and buggy now, and they’re all in central park. %$* 175
uh, the u.s., unlike, uh, almost every other, uh, great power that we’ve seen, has shown itself entirely open to change, to adjustment. %$* 175
instead of trying to defend, uh, an increasingly uncompetitive status quo, we’ve rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america found ways to innovate, the adjust, to continue to be competitive, despite the changes that necessarily take place in the world around us today. %$* 175
trouble is a given, change is a given. %$* 175
it’s unfortunate, it’s different for people that are faced with the immediate consequences of it, but there is really very little alternative to it. %$* 175
finally, we have a four and a half percent unemployment rate in this country. %$* 175
how much lower do we really want it to go? %$* 175
thank you. %$* 171
on the commercial realities part, i’d like to get in a word there, uh %$* 172
sorry, bill gertz, yes. %$* 171
yeah, uh, the issue of uh, china’s proliferation activities hasn’t been raised, but china, uh, as, uh, many of us know, gave nuclear technology to pakistan in the, uh, ‘80’s and ‘90’s. %$* 172
that nuclear technology ended up going to libya, and uh, iran and north korea. %$* 172
and uh, they even found chinese language nuclear warhead design documents when they dismantled libya’s nuclear program. %$* 172
uh, chinese companies since 2001 have been sanctioned more than eighty times. %$* 172
and uh, they’re doing this rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america as part of a policy that’s usually denied by the central government, but in reality, uh, uh, china is helping these rogue states with its, uh, with weapons technology, both missiles and weapons of mass destruction. %$* 172
thank you very much, bill gertz. %$* 171
and finally onto censorship. %$* 171
i, i, well i’m against that too, thank you. %$* 177
um, on censorship, the quick answer is the internet has changed china, and, and china is fighting a losing battle every day with information. %$* 177
you wouldn’t believe what is on the blogs. %$* 177
um, google handled it okay, yahoo handled it terribly. %$* 177
what google did is they had to be in that market, i’m glad they’re in that market because they’re pushing the envelope on, on freedom of information. %$* 177
and what they did is they labeled their searches that they’re censored, which drove the chinese government crazy. %$* 177
yahoo, on the other hand, caved right in, gave them names of people that were using yahoo email accounts. %$* 177
um, we have to be there, we have to be pushing for freedom on information, and it’s happening, let the chinese people do it. %$* 177
jim mcgregor, thank you very much. %$* 171
um, i know that many more of you have questions. %$* 171
i’m afraid, uh, we’re not gonna have time for them, but please feel free to maul our panelists after the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america debate. %$* 171
um, the uh, we now, the final um, stage of this is that uh, each of the panelists gets two minutes, uh, to sum up. %$* 171
and we start with, stape roy. %$* 171
start with %$* 8
yeah. %$* 180
start with jim mcgregor. %$* 8
no, we’re starting with jim. %$* 180
oh sorry, yeah, it says jim, but since stapleton, go ahead. %$* 171
jim mcgregor. %$* 171
yeah, oh, i, i don’t really know what there is to add to this, other than we really haven’t been talking about the chinese people at all. %$* 177
why don’t we give them a chance? %$* 177
the chinese people are, are moving ahead very quickly. %$* 177
they are not idiots, they’re very smart. %$* 177
they’re pushing their government every day. %$* 177
we’re trying to tell them you must be democrats tomorrow. %$* 177
the last time they took an, a government system from the west, it was communism. %$* 177
they don’t want another one of those. %$* 177
um, give them the time to find their own way. %$* 177
you talk about, uh, the rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america string of pearls, uh, strategy. %$* 177
the string of pearls strategy i see every day in the markets when people are bargaining for pearls. %$* 177
uh, they don’t want to come and attack america, they want to come here and go to vegas, they want to go to colorado skiing, they wanna shop on rodeo drive. %$* 177
the chinese are joining the world. %$* 177
this is not a, a country, uh, run by monsters who want to take over the united states. %$* 177
they just want to be somebody in the world, and if, if we handle them with some, uh, some skill and some, uh, some sympathy. %$* 177
but also tough where they are violating international rules like proliferation and intellectual property rights, the u.s.and china can have a very good relationship. %$* 177
i would just like to, uh, say please, um, do not tell uh, uh, secretary gates that um, that mr. %$* 177
pillsbury who works at the department of defense has asked you to vote against america tonight. %$* 177
america can, america can handle china. %$* 177
thank you, thank you. %$* 174
thank you very much, jim mcgregor. %$* 171
now john mearsheimer, for the motion. %$* 171
ambassador roy made the point that chinese leaders today don’t think about dominating asia. %$* 176
and i think he’s correct. %$* 176
they rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america don’t. %$* 176
and the reason that they don’t is because they do not have the wherewithal or anything near the wherewithal to think about dominating ch-, uh, dominating asia. %$* 176
the question you have to ask yourself is how are the chinese likely to think when they look something like the united states today, when they really are very, very powerful? %$* 176
to give you an analogy, it’s like having money. %$* 176
uh, i’ve gotten wealthier over time, which is not to say i’ve gotten wealthy. %$* 176
but i’ve gotten wealthier over time, i’ve accumulated more money. %$* 176
and i think about spending that money and doing things with that money in very different ways now that i have it than i did when i didn’t have two nickels to rub together. %$* 176
and the point that i would make to you about china is that there’s gonna come a point, uh, in the story that we’re telling up here, where china is extremely powerful. %$* 176
and i think then, it will begin to think about subjects like taiwan very differently. %$* 176
of course the chinese don’t want to pick a fight with the united states now over taiwan, they know what would happen, they would get clobbered. %$* 176
the question you have to ask yourself is in a world where china has a huge navy, a much bigger and more efficient army, more missiles, right, and the united states is at a significant disadvantage in east asia, which is a great distance away from this country, how do you think china will then think about taiwan and the possibility of using threats? %$* 176
i’d bet a lot of money that they’ll think very differently and it won’t be to our advantage. %$* 176
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america john mearsheimer, thank you very much. %$* 171
now against the motion, daniel rosen. %$* 171
so much has been said, two quick concluding points. %$* 175
firstly, are we confident that our institutions, our way of going about growing an economy, spending our lives is profoundly superior, better to the way china is organized? %$* 175
to the problems of china we’ve discussed this evening? %$* 175
i’m confident. %$* 175
and thus i’m confident that for china to match us in terms of wealth creation, prosperity over time, they’ll necessarily have to move in the direction of our institutions, our way of behaving in the world. %$* 175
i have no doubt about that. %$* 175
secondly, the problems that are existential in nature, really threaten our welfare today, are no longer realist in nature. %$* 175
maybe unfortunately. %$* 175
the greatest force projection on planet earth could not stop 9/11 from taking place in this city, could it? %$* 175
the challenges of global environmental change, climate chance, cannot be addressed in any way whatsoever with for-, force projection. %$* 175
we are in trouble already. %$* 175
is there trouble down the road? %$* 175
there’s trouble here today. %$* 175
the question is what evolution of china best serves our interest in addressing those troubles and minimizing the trouble our children will have to deal with, we’ll have to deal with for the rest rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america of our careers. %$* 175
it seems abundantly clear to me that a china stronger, more prosperous, further down the road to democracy as well, uh, is what we want to see as we turn to address all these problems which can no longer be dealt with just by the u.s.navy. %$* 175
thanks. %$* 175
daniel rosen, thank you very much. %$* 171
now for the motion, michael pillsbury. %$* 171
thank you. %$* 174
uh, i forgot to quote from nancy pelosi a little bit earlier, uh, because you keep referring to us as the right, i thought perhaps you should hear a couple of sentences from the speaker of the house of representatives. %$* 174
she was attacking president bush last april during the visit of hu jintao. %$* 174
she said that she opposed the celebratory nature of the official visit. %$* 174
she said our own debt, uh, with china is growing so fast, they’ll soon be making our foreign policy. %$* 174
she said trickle-down liberty is not going to work, it’s an illusion. %$* 174
she said that we should avoid wishful thinking about china ever being a, becoming a responsible stakeholder. %$* 174
she said our trade relationship with china has been a disaster, despite more than a decade of concessions, the trade deficit with china has grown from four billion a year to more than four billion a week. %$* 174
china continues to manipulate its currency, making its exports cheaper and u.s. %$* 174
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america imports more expensive than they would be in a free market condition. %$* 174
if president bush kowtows to beijing in ways that threaten our long-standing commitment to taiwan, members of both parties in congress will be watching. %$* 174
she concluded by saying the american people wanted the administration to show resolve in standing up to beijing. %$* 174
so all of you supporters in the audience of george bush, be sure to vote for the other team. %$* 174
you’re gonna vote with us then, right? %$* 8
because here is nancy pelosi, rather articulately saying “beware the dragon: the boom in china spells trouble for america.” %$* 174
an extraordinary intelligence squared moment there, michael pelosi, michael, i was gonna say michael pelosi, michael pillsbury channeling his inner nancy pelosi, thank you very much. %$* 171
stapleton roy now going to channel, i don’t know who, i think stapleton roy finishing up against the motion. %$* 171
let’s look at the process. %$* 173
china was outside the system, thirty years ago. %$* 173
it favored polar variation. %$* 173
we have had trouble with rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america china every stage of the process, but it’s been moving toward becoming a more responsible part of the international community. %$* 173
it signed a nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1992.it signed a comprehensive test ban treaty two years later. %$* 173
it now cooperates with the missile technology control regime. %$* 173
we’ve sanctioned them in various way at every stage of this process, china has improved. %$* 173
but it has been troublesome. %$* 173
so it’s not easy to deal with china. %$* 173
but look at the trend. %$* 173
look at asia. %$* 173
asia is the one country in the, uh, the one region of the world where every authoritarian system that has gone through thirty to forty years of rapid economic development, has stayed open to the outside world, has been embedded in the global economic system, and it’s had friendly relations with the united states, has moved from authoritarian systems of government to representative forms of government, no exceptions. %$* 173
south korea, taiwan, thailand, indonesia. %$* 173
china’s only partway along that. %$* 173
it’s a strategic gamble. %$* 173
if china doesn’t become wealthier, it’s not going to become democratic. %$* 173
but if china becomes wealthier, it becomes more powerful. %$* 173
that’s a challenge for our diplomacy. %$* 173
are we up to it? %$* 173
you bet we are. %$* 173
we’re good at it. %$* 173
when we give ourselves a chance. %$* 173
we know how to use the right balance of power and influence, and if we get it right, china can we a more prosperous, friendly country to the united states. %$* 173
it’s not going to run roughshod in its own neighborhood because it’ll be rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america slapped down by not just the united states. %$* 173
we don’t have to deal with china alone. %$* 173
if we have good relations with japan, with russia, with india, and with the other countries of east asia, china is not going to have the opportunity. %$* 173
that’ s our challenge. %$* 173
it’s a good challenge. %$* 173
i say neither beware nor embrace the dragon. %$* 173
be realistic and advance our own interests intelligently %$* 173
stapleton roy, your time. %$* 171
thank you very much. %$* 171
bravo, bravo, %$* 8
and finally, for the motion, bill gertz. %$* 171
yes, thank, i, i wanna thank the intelligence squared for this debate. %$* 172
i think it’s a very important, uh, debate. %$* 172
and the debate we’re having tonight i think is reflective of a debate that’s currently going on at the highest levels of the u.s.government. %$* 172
and that debate can be characterized, uh, on the one side you have condoleezza rice going to beijing shortly before she became secretary of state and said, “we want a strong china.” on the other side of the debate are people in the national security community, the pentagon, who said, “wait a minute. %$* 172
there are so many unknowns about china. %$* 172
we don’t know what takes place. %$* 172
we don’t know.” when we have all of these military rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s. - beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america exchanges that mike pillsbury talks about, one of the first questions is, “what is the extent of the military buildup of china? %$* 172
” the chinese will not answer. %$* 172
when you combine that with china’s use of deception, that is, deliberate strategic misinformation to misguide us. %$* 172
we know very little about it. %$* 172
therefore it is, it is dangerous in my view that we should, uh, want to see a strong china, and that, uh, really we have to keep our powder dry until we can find out what goes on in the inner councils of, of the chinese system. %$* 172
uh, and for that reason, i, i urge you to vote uh, for the motion tonight. %$* 172
bill gertz, thank you very much. %$* 171
well, that uh, brings to and end, the um, the talking, and now for the action. %$* 171
we return to these uh, crazy contraptions, your um, your voting pads. %$* 171
please uh, pick them up again, and let’s see if i can get it right this time. %$* 171
could you, in, in voting, press “one” if you’re for the motion, “two” if you’re against the motion, and “three” if you’re still undecided. %$* 171
so could you cast your vote now? %$* 171
michael pillsbury has just told me that it’s like american idol, um %$* 171
i’m not sure on that basis, uh, who will win. %$* 171
they’ll kick us all off. %$* 8
rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america exactly. %$* 171
um, now before um, before i tell you the results of the vote, i just want to take care of couple of things. %$* 171
firstly, i’d like to thank our panel of debaters, stapleton roy, daniel rosen, uh, jim mcgregor, michael pillsbury, john mearsheimer, and bill gertz, thank you very much indeed. %$* 171
i also would like to thank you, the audience, for your, uh, thoughtful engagement, uh, here this evening. %$* 171
don’t need to give yourself another round of applause that was more than good enough. %$* 171
um, but then of course i’d really like to thank, uh, intelligence squared, which was brought this, uh, the eighth, uh, and final debate of this season, um, uh, here to the u.s.uh, it’s been an extraordinary success and brought really substantive and complicated issues to be, to be debated and be discussed, uh, in, in what i hope you’ll agree is a very en-, engaging and thought provoking way. %$* 171
um, you will of course be hungering for the next debate, and uh, it is “spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea.” uh, it, that will be held, on uh, tuesday, september the 18th. %$* 171
“spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea.” um, before you maul our panelists, you may want to uh, rush out and uh, get tickets for the full season. %$* 171
and while i’m doing the plugs, let me tell you that if you want to go and listen to this whole thing all over again, you certainly should do on wnyc, uh, rosenkranz foundation - intelligence squared u.s.- beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america am820 on friday, may the 25th, at uh, seven in the evening. %$* 171
and we’re very uh, uh, much appreciate, uh, the support from them. %$* 171
and, and again, there are copies of books by bill gertz and jim mcgregor, you know, which are for sale upstairs. %$* 171
uh, and there are also dvds of previous debates available from intelligence squared. %$* 171
uh, while i’m about it, i should tell you there are copies of the times of london newspaper upstairs, so pick one of those up, they, they have the, uh, glorious advantage of being free this evening for you. %$* 171
uh, now, finally, let’s get to business. %$* 171
what are the results of the debate? %$* 171
now, let me remind you where you stood before the debate. %$* 171
forty-one percent were for the motion, and just so i do this properly, “beware the dragon: a booming china,” sorry, “beware the dragon: a booming china spells trouble for america.” before the debate, forty-one percent for the motion, thirty-seven percent against the motion, twenty-one percent undecided. %$* 171
after the debate, 35 percent for the motion, 58.6 percent against the motion 6.1 percent undecided. %$* 171
the team against the motion wins. %$* 171
thank you very much indeed. %$* 171

and now i'd like to invite all of our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
i'm told there's one exception to the no phone rule, and that is if you are tweeting. %$* 13
you can tweet to your heart's content. %$* 13
and so that's it. %$* 13
i also want to-- %$* 13
this is the last of our regular season in our fifth season of intelligence squared u.s.and all of them are because of the generosity of our chairman, the rosenkranz foundation, who makes this all possible. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the stage mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you very much. %$* 1
it's great to see you all. %$* 1
and my task in these proceedings is to frame the debate, to give a sense of the arguments on both sides. %$* 1
and for more than a century, the statue of liberty has welcomed visitors with an emma lazarus poem engraved on its pedestal. %$* 1
tonight's motion comes from one of the most famous lines in that poem, "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." well, today, many would want to rewrite those lines to read “give me your energetic, your affluent, your educated elites.” but how should we feel about poorly educated, unskilled immigrants, especially those here illegally? %$* 1
if we analyze the question in terms of costs and benefits, we can see that those who benefit from immigrant labor are a very different group than those who shoulder the costs. %$* 1
and that may be why the issue is so controversial. %$* 1
employers of low-wage immigrant labor reach the major benefits, large scale farming operations benefit. %$* 1
and as concerned as we all gain from lower food prices, owners and patrons of restaurants benefit. %$* 1
affluent household benefit from child care, landscape maintenance, housecleaning and all manner of other services that only immigrants seem eager to provide. %$* 1
the costs are borne very differently. %$* 1
low-wage immigrants receive more from government, especially state and local governments than they pay in taxes. %$* 1
the state provides education for their children. %$* 1
it provides emergency medical care and array of other benefits. %$* 1
in some communities, crime and drug issues disrupt the lives of law-abiding citizens and impose major costs for police, courts and prisons. %$* 1
all these costs add up to a major fiscal drag. %$* 1
and it's no wonder that states like arizona favor stricter enforcement of existing laws. %$* 1
and if we think about the question more philosophically, both sides of the debate can cite appealing principles. %$* 1
“give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” does express american generosity of spirit, the vision of our nation as a beacon of opportunity and invokes a rich history of immigrant groups that have succeeded here. %$* 1
but equally appealing principles point in the opposite direction, respect for the rule of law and a basic sense of fairness are also bedrock american values. %$* 1
policies that reward those here illegally at the expense of those patiently waiting for legal status fly in the face of those principles. %$* 1
considering the costs and the benefits, considering the conflicting principles, which side of the argument should prevail? %$* 1
well, it's up to you to decide. %$* 1
and it's now my privilege to turn the evening to our panelists and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you, john. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i'd just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
the famous verse inscribed on a plaque at the base of the statue of liberty says "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free." but do we really all agree on what that means? %$* 13
or if we flip it around and say, "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses," what does that mean? %$* 13
well, that's what we are here to debate. %$* 13
this is another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
and here on the stage we have two teams of two members each to argue over this motion, "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." we have a texas mayor. %$* 13
we have a man who has written laws on immigration. %$* 13
we have a former congressman and a journalist who has written about immigration who will be arguing this out and trying to change your minds because that's what this is. %$* 13
this is a debate in which you, our live audience, are the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winners. %$* 13
so let's go to your preliminary vote, where you stand on this issue before you actually hear the arguments. %$* 13
there are key pads at your seat on the right hand side. %$* 13
and if you agree with our motion, “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,” press number one. %$* 13
and, yes, you're voting for a negative so, it's a little bit tricky. %$* 13
be careful with that. %$* 13
if you agree-- %$* 13
if you disagree with this motion, press number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you think you made a mistake, just fix it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and we're going to share the results of that vote at the end-- %$* 13
the vote that you just made at the end of the debate as we present both the before and the after votes to tell us who you chose as our winner. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
round one, we have opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
and with our motion, “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,” speaking first for this motion, tom tancredo. %$* 13
he's a former colorado congressman who sought the 2008 republican nomination for president to bring attention to the issue of illegal immigration. %$* 13
and while the language of this debate is a little bit spicy and to a degree metaphorical because we know that you're not against all-- %$* 13
not against all immigration. %$* 13
it's not that absolute. %$* 13
you did, nevertheless, sign up to argue for this side. %$* 13
that's right. %$* 219
don't give us %$* 13
and, tom, so in a sentence, why have you identified yourself so powerfully with this battle on illegal immigration? %$* 13
well, i will be happy to answer that. %$* 219
let me first tell you that i must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, i was a little bit uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in new york city a few miles from ellis island. %$* 219
and i have been-- %$* 219
i have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed, and i can recall a spoof of me, a debate-- %$* 219
or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and vincente fox, but it was a spoof on "saturday night live," and so they had someone who looked like-- %$* 219
and i knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing vincente fox was antonio banderas-- %$* 219
no fair, come on, guys. %$* 219
so to my question, in a sentence, why do you identify so powerfully with this? %$* 13
frankly, i-- %$* 219
you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both legal and illegal, and they are fascinating. %$* 219
it is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy i think we can possibly talk about. %$* 219
okay, we'll let you go, ladies and gentlemen, tom tancredo. %$* 13
a great deal of mythology has built up around the statue of liberty, around the emma lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that. %$* 219
it's mythology. %$* 219
but unfortunately we have a tendency in the united states, we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us, and that's our first thought usually. %$* 219
and i am the same way. %$* 219
i am the grandson of italian immigrants, came right here into ellis island. %$* 219
and my parents being first generation americans were very, very strict about one thing and that was to become an american, to become-- %$* 219
and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways, and i'll get to it in a minute, except that i do want you to understand i have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was, but we can't confuse that and make-- %$* 219
and develop true policy today based on mythology and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel. %$* 219
i think tonight's a good place to do it, it’s-- %$* 219
first of all the statue of liberty was not a gift from france that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration. %$* 219
indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy. %$* 219
it had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic. %$* 219
in fact, the statue was called “liberty enlightening the world.” it was not called “liberty inviting the world.” as for the emma lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here. %$* 219
and it was about that time that the author of the poem, ms. %$* 219
lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups. %$* 219
remember also that a lot of the tired, and poor, and huddled masses got stamped “return to sender" here at ellis island. %$* 219
there were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at ellis island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home. %$* 219
it was not a take all comers time in american history. %$* 219
as for the poor, well, long before the ellis island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy. %$* 219
in new york in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, "a visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit." in 1996 in the congress of the united states, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if you’re coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support. %$* 219
they put it in, it was part of the welfare reform bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced. %$* 219
and so the fact is we are in a-- %$* 219
unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the united states. %$* 219
the national academy of sciences along with the center for immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households. %$* 219
federation for immigration reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to american taxpayers of over $150 billion annually. %$* 219
now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in american history, we had what i would think was, and believe, is a rational policy. %$* 219
it was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especially during the hay-day of american immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people. %$* 219
why? %$* 219
because, of course, we were building the industrial revolution here. %$* 219
they were fueling it. %$* 219
that was appropriate. %$* 219
it was right. %$* 219
it served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here. %$* 219
i hope-- %$* 219
well, also, as i see we’re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth i want to try to dispel quickly. %$* 219
and that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time america started until today, that it’s always just been going up. %$* 219
absolutely untrue. %$* 219
about 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the united states. %$* 219
it started to climb. %$* 219
by 1850, it started to go down. %$* 219
around 1880, it grew. %$* 219
around 1890, it declined. %$* 219
it rose dramatically right before the first world war, but declined dramatically after the first world war with the immigration act of 1924.it stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the immigration act that was pushed by senator kennedy at the time, senator teddy kennedy. %$* 219
and we’ve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time. %$* 219
now whether or not those-- %$* 219
that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization i just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not. %$* 219
it had and served a good purpose, i think. %$* 219
we had periods of high immigration. %$* 219
we had periods of low immigration. %$* 219
and you know what happened during the periods of low immigration? %$* 219
people used that time to assimilate. %$* 219
and let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate. %$* 219
assimilation-- %$* 219
we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, as i say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it. %$* 219
or, if it doesn’t happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring. %$* 219
it’s not occurring to the extent-- %$* 219
i mean, i know you can’t categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country. %$* 219
we desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being americans, to connect together, not pull us apart. %$* 219
and i’m afraid our immigration policy is doing just that. %$* 219
thank you, tom tancredo. %$* 13
our motion is "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." and here to argue against the motion, i’d like to introduce julián castro. %$* 13
he is mayor of san antonio, texas. %$* 13
he is a superstar in his party. %$* 13
he was the youngest, at the time, the youngest member ever elected to the san antonio council and is now the youngest mayor of a major u.s. city, although, julián, you know that if you stay in that job a lot longer, people are going to stop saying that. %$* 13
i’m already starting to get the grey hair. %$* 220
ladies and gentlemen, julián castro. %$* 13
thank you all very much. %$* 220
thank you. %$* 220
thank you very much, and let me say thank you, john, and to everyone here at “intelligence squared,” to congressman tancredo, secretary kobach, and to all the folks who showed up tonight. %$* 220
we appreciate being here. %$* 220
tamar jacoby and i have the distinct pleasure of arguing against the motion on the table tonight. %$* 220
you know, last week, i’m a little bit embarrassed to say that at 3:20 in the morning, central time, i woke up to flip on cnn to watch the royal wedding. %$* 220
i admit it. %$* 220
i couldn’t help myself. %$* 220
it was one of those moments that you’d just rather see live than see on tape. %$* 220
my wife didn’t even wake up. %$* 220
she stayed asleep and i woke up. %$* 220
and they had about two hours of coverage before the bride actually showed up on the doorstep of westminster abbey. %$* 220
and in the background of the coverage in one of the shots on abc or cnn-- %$* 220
one of the networks that was covering it, there was laid out on a fence post, the united states flag, the flag of america. %$* 220
and i was surprised to see that, although it was a welcome sight. %$* 220
but there was something in my mind that told me that that american flag looked out of place at the royal wedding. %$* 220
and as i thought about it more, the reason that our american flag looked out of place is because our country has never been a country about royalty or caste or one's station in life. %$* 220
it has always been defined as a country for the strivers, for the aspirers, for the folks who can pull themselves up by their boot straps, who are willing to take the chance, the entrepreneurs, most of whom start off as folks of lesser means, folks who make themselves. %$* 220
and this country, the united states, of all the countries in the world and all the countries throughout history, has defined itself as the nation that has taken in folks from around the world and allowed them to pursue their dreams, to reach their american dream and to become, from some who was poor and huddled among masses, to someone who is successful and able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalist system. %$* 220
and so it is that i believe we need to continue to welcome not only the wealthy but the poor from other countries. %$* 220
we need to do that for several reasons. %$* 220
the first is that immigrants are vital to our national economy. %$* 220
immigrants actually found companies at almost twice the rate of native born u.s.citizens. %$* 220
companies founded by immigrants in the years between 1995 and 2005 actually created 450,000 jobs in the united states of america. %$* 220
in one single year, they generated $52 billion in sales in industries like high technology and engineering; that the number of folks who start those companies is at 25 percent nationally. %$* 220
and in silicon valley, it's at 52.4 percent. %$* 220
and remember, it is a false distinction to think that the folks who found these companies start off as wealthy. %$* 220
oftentimes they don't. %$* 220
think about your own experience, either in your own family, or how many times have you heard someone tell the story of their family member who came here with just a few dollars in their pocket and were able to contribute great things to this country? %$* 220
congressman tancredo also mentioned the idea of assimilation. %$* 220
and i believe that it is important for folks generally to assimilate to a common culture in the united states. %$* 220
and that's exactly what has been happening in the united states of america throughout our history with immigrants. %$* 220
what we have seen consistently, and i think that congressman tancredo and i agree, what we have seen is that from time to time there has been this very intense concern about balkanization. %$* 220
benjamin franklin famously said that we should rid pennsylvania of the germans in 1751.we had the alien and sedition act of 1798, the chinese exclusion act. %$* 220
we had the fear in the early 1940s during world war ii that germans and japanese would somehow try and overthrow the government of the united states. %$* 220
the reason that we have succeeded as a nation, that today we are the most powerful economy in the world is that we have been able to overcome those impulses. %$* 220
and i believe that we need to continue to overcome those impulses for the future. %$* 220
it's also incorrect to say that immigrants only take, and they don't give. %$* 220
in 1993, the urban institute did a study that found that 94 percent of immigrants were not on welfare and that the distinction between immigrants and natives in terms of who was on welfare was less than three percent. %$* 220
they also contribute up to $240 billion in taxes overall into social security and medicare that they're actually never going to get a chance to use. %$* 220
and the national conference of state legislatures, a few years ago, did an analysis of 16 different states. %$* 220
and they found that in five of those, including some of the biggest ones, new york and texas, that there was a net positive from immigrants, including illegal immigrants, versus a negative. %$* 220
and so this idea that they don't pay taxes, that they only take, that they're on welfare, the evidence clearly demonstrates that that's not the case. %$* 220
i also believe, and i anticipate that some may argue that having so many folks come to our country is not good in terms of crime. %$* 220
the numbers bear out that immigrant communities are actually safer than nonimmigrant communities. %$* 220
terrorism, the idea that somehow there are many folks walking across our borders that are going to commit acts of terror against folks in the united states. %$* 220
i don't believe that's true, either. %$* 220
in fact, in 2010, of the 463,000 apprehensions that we had in the united states, two 10,000ths of one percent were apprehensions from folks that, excluding cuba, were from countries that were listed as a state sponsor of terror. %$* 220
what we're catching really are a whole bunch of folks who are yearning to breathe free, who are chasing the same values. %$* 220
congressman tancredo asked what's going to keep us together. %$* 220
what's going to keep us together is what always has kept us together as a nation, the fact that people come here to work. %$* 220
they're entrepreneurial. %$* 220
they believe in democracy. %$* 220
they're people of good faith. %$* 220
they have the same values that have always made america great. %$* 220
and i hope we'll continue to do so if we can get the policy right. %$* 220
thank you. %$* 220
julián castro, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
so a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening statements of this “intelligence squared u.s.” debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
and we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce kris kobach, who is secretary of state for the state of kansas, and who also gets around the country quite a bit consulting as a lawyer for other states on immigration laws. %$* 13
he was the co-author of arizona's controversial sb1070. you are also defending laws-- %$* 13
no hissing, please. %$* 13
you're also defending laws in i believe missouri, texas. %$* 13
where else? %$* 13
nebraska. %$* 221
nebraska. %$* 13
pennsylvania. %$* 221
pennsylvania. %$* 13
now, your-- %$* 13
do people in kansas think you're not taking this secretary of state thing not seriously if you're getting around so much? %$* 13
well, i'm making plenty of noise there too. %$* 221
okay. %$* 13
i just want to remind you to move a little closer to your mic. %$* 13
and ladies and gentlemen, kris kobach. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 221
my work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when i served as counsel to john ashcroft at the justice department. %$* 221
and after i left the justice department in 2003, i left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it. %$* 221
but it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level. %$* 221
and that's why i got involved helping states like arizona and many other states. %$* 221
in 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state. %$* 221
not all of them passed, but that's an important point. %$* 221
every state is a border state now. %$* 221
the reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold. %$* 221
but the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and i'd like to start there. %$* 221
the fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable. %$* 221
my point can be summarized in one sentence by nobel laureate, milton friedman. %$* 221
he said, it's just obvious. %$* 221
you can't have open immigration and a welfare state. %$* 221
you can't have open immigration and a welfare state. %$* 221
now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience. %$* 221
i am not a big fan myself, i accept the reality that it's here to stay. %$* 221
and given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration. %$* 221
they were not immigrating into a welfare state. %$* 221
they were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits. %$* 221
there was no safety net to catch them. %$* 221
that is a critical distinction that changes everything. %$* 221
when emma lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden-- %$* 221
the lamp by the golden door. %$* 221
now, the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity. %$* 221
you come here, you're free to do whatever you can. %$* 221
you make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you. %$* 221
now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the united states more than any other nation in the western hemisphere. %$* 221
the golden door represents something completely different. %$* 221
now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than u.s.citizens are doing so. %$* 221
now, the average per household consumption-- %$* 221
that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net. %$* 221
they're consuming-- %$* 221
and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined. %$* 221
19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes. %$* 221
so that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country. %$* 221
now, julián mentioned this 1993 study. %$* 221
i have not seen that study. %$* 221
that is so old i wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then. %$* 221
now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country. %$* 221
there was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the center for immigration studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the u.s.citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare. %$* 221
now, the explanation for this is obvious. %$* 221
it has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics. %$* 221
poor people are more likely to consume welfare. %$* 221
and immigrants coming into the united states, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education. %$* 221
if you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country. %$* 221
here's another fact to chew on. %$* 221
the mexico-american border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet. %$* 221
there is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater. %$* 221
that fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too. %$* 221
so since 1996, congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem. %$* 221
most states have ignored that law. %$* 221
new york is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens. %$* 221
new york also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens. %$* 221
think about that if you are a-- %$* 221
well, i don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates. %$* 221
now, the-- %$* 221
nationwide, as tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes. %$* 221
and the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states. %$* 221
indeed, i like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, and then the states have to pay the burden. %$* 221
you can think of story after story about this. %$* 221
hazelton, pennsylvania, one of the cities that i'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat. %$* 221
population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income. %$* 221
and the city wasn't getting any revenues. %$* 221
look what happened. %$* 221
all the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population. %$* 221
the school districts, the budget was breaking, english as a second language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year. %$* 221
in 2006, they went up to 1.1 million. %$* 221
talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district. %$* 221
the same thing is happening at the national level. %$* 221
and as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost. %$* 221
or take it on the individual level. %$* 221
look at the jobs. %$* 221
there are 14 million americans out of work. %$* 221
a vast majority of the 11.3 illegal-- %$* 221
million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce. %$* 221
many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a u.s.citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today. %$* 221
it actually works. %$* 221
but of course many of you are probably thinking, and i'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for americans to do. %$* 221
well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry-- %$* 221
industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, u.s.citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, u.s.citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, u.s.citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, u.s.citizens. %$* 221
the u.s.citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright. %$* 221
so if we care about our fiscal health, and if we care about the americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the united states. %$* 221
this is our motion, "don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses." and now here to speak against the motion, tamar jacoby, actually had a long career as a journalist, was a writer, a justice reporter for newsweek, then was deputy editor of the op-ed page in the new york times. %$* 13
and then you went on to write books about immigration, and now you're running an organization called "immigrationworks usa," and you're not approaching this from the left but you're actually looking at it from the point of the small businessmen whom your organization assists and, tamar, i just want to say i’m very glad to hear about the post- journalism career success personally. %$* 13
it’s very heartening. %$* 13
you too can go into politics. %$* 222
ladies and gentleman ladies and gentleman, tamar jacoby. %$* 13
thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event. %$* 222
so, like all of us, i’m a descendant of immigrants. %$* 222
in my case, there were two kinds of immigrants. %$* 222
on one side were the eastern european jews, and on the other side were the people who came on the mayflower. %$* 222
so, i grew up in a house where i had two lessons. %$* 222
one was that difference was really kind of what made us great. %$* 222
it’s certainly what made the two sides of my family great. %$* 222
and i learned to understand later it was what made the country great. %$* 222
but i also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common-- %$* 222
this was another lesson in my household-- %$* 222
what we have in common is more important than our differences. %$* 222
and so i see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is to make sure that balance is in the right-- %$* 222
is in balance, that we’re getting the benefits of the difference, but we’re also holding together as one country. %$* 222
and that’s where i start when i’m considering immigration. %$* 222
it’s not-- %$* 222
there have been words thrown around here: nostalgia, generosity, i’m not sure anybody mentioned rights, but that’s another way that a lot of people come at it. %$* 222
i don’t come at immigration from any of those perspectives. %$* 222
i come at it from what is in america’s interest. %$* 222
what’s really good for us, for our economy, for our security, and for our future? %$* 222
and that’s why i’m dead set against this motion. %$* 222
i don’t think it’s good for our economy or for our values. %$* 222
so let’s start by being honest. %$* 222
immigration is about economics. %$* 222
it’s driven by economics, for the people who get up in their home villages and come here, and it’s driven by economics for the americans who hire them. %$* 222
and the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win- win. %$* 222
immigrants create jobs. %$* 222
and contrary to what you’ve just heard from kris kobach, it’s counterintuitive, i know, but you heard me right. %$* 222
immigrants create jobs. %$* 222
it’s easy to see how that works on the high end. %$* 222
the 25 percent of the patents in the united states that are taken out by people who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in america who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering ph.d.s who are foreign-born. %$* 222
and you heard it from my partner, julián, the quarter of the tech startups that were started by foreign-born. %$* 222
as in the past, countries competed-- %$* 222
powerful countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies. %$* 222
today, countries around the world are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants. %$* 222
but it’s true at the low end, too, that immigrants create jobs. %$* 222
and again, i know this gets even more counterintuitive, but, you know, i’ll never forget here-- %$* 222
and this is really what partly brought me to do exactly what i’m doing now-- %$* 222
hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the eastern shore of maryland talk about his company. %$* 222
he came to the floor of the senate and he did this. %$* 222
he talked about how he had a 100-year-old family company. %$* 222
the native born people on the eastern shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work. %$* 222
americans like full-- %$* 222
year-round jobs. %$* 222
no one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell. %$* 222
so he brought mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell-- %$* 222
very low-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers. %$* 222
you know, that’s the low end of the economic totem pole. %$* 222
but because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keep his company open in a way that he wouldn’t have been able to if he didn’t have them. %$* 222
and because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the company and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company. %$* 222
and because he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in the town where the tourists came to eat seafood. %$* 222
and because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can get the picture-- %$* 222
up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totem seafood pickers were keeping an economy going. %$* 222
and the point is that on both the top and the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill ladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce. %$* 222
the american workforce is changing. %$* 222
we’re getting older. %$* 222
people are-- %$* 222
we’re having smaller families. %$* 222
people are retiring sooner. %$* 222
we’ve created-- %$* 222
we have holes at the top and bottom of the workforce, and we’re lucky that they’re filled by immigrants who, because they’re different from americans, either more or less skilled, they’re complementary, not competitive. %$* 222
they create jobs for americans. %$* 222
of course, there are costs, and we’ll talk more about the costs in this-- %$* 222
i don’t deny there are costs to immigration, but in the long run, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad. %$* 222
our need for workers also changes. %$* 222
that’s not so-- %$* 222
in a bad economy, we need fewer foreign workers and in a good economy, we need more. %$* 222
but ultimately, the point is the patents, those phds, the startups and the jobs for u.s.workers up and down the food chain. %$* 222
and the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle what i think is a given of the interconnected world. %$* 222
we're lucky immigrants are coming to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy. %$* 222
and how are we going to handle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits, minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values? %$* 222
and this is really where i differ from my opponents in this debate. %$* 222
i too am for the rule of law. %$* 222
i too am for security and effective enforcement. %$* 222
but i also think we need to be honest about our needs. %$* 222
it doesn't really work i don't think to have two signs at the border, one that says, "help wanted,"-- %$* 222
one that says, "keep out" and one that says "help wanted." i don't think that's an honest standup way to go about our business. %$* 222
i don't think we want to treat the people who come to work for us-- %$* 222
i think we want to treat them in an honest, standup way. %$* 222
we don't want to say, "wink, wink, nudge, nudge, come on in" when times are good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave. %$* 222
ultimately, that's what i think today's debate is about. %$* 222
it's about how to do we deal with the reality of our economic needs in a way that's consistent with our values? %$* 222
and if you listen tonight, what i think you should be asking yourself is whose way is more likely to lead to a successful immigration and successful integration or assimilation? %$* 222
is the best way accepting reality, allowing people to be here legally, treating them with dignity, or is the best way pretending that we don't need these workers, pretending that we can drive them out when we can't and driving them further underground? %$* 222
thank you. %$* 13
tamar jacoby. %$* 13
and that concludes round one, opening statements of this “intelligence squared” debate. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are past opening statements, and we're about to go into round two, and that's where the debaters address each other one on one. %$* 13
they take questions from me. %$* 13
and after a little bit, we'll take questions from you as well. %$* 13
and i want to, again, urge you, when you're formulating your question, to really think in terms of something that's terse and on the point and that really is a question. %$* 13
so if it has a question mark at the end of it that's there appropriately, that's the telltale sign that it's functioning as a question. %$* 13
what i'm trying to discourage is your debating with the debaters, but to throw something in here that would actually make them continue to hash out the issues. %$* 13
so i've got to do this part for radio. %$* 13
and i'll do this from time to time. %$* 13
i just need to do a little make believe welcome backs kind of thing, and we're taking a break, even though we really won't. %$* 13
so it would be a great help to me if you could do a round of applause that-- %$* 13
that will play coming back from a break in the radio broadcast, and then i'll start talking. %$* 13
thanks very much for doing this. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
so we are back, and now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at an “intelligence squared u.s.” debate at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
our motion is “don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.” we have two teams of two members each who have been arguing it out. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion says that we're working under an out-of-control immigration system where the wrong people are getting in the wrong way and exploiting america's generosity, while also, in some cases, diluting america's american-ness. %$* 13
the other side is arguing that immigration may need some fixing but that it is vital for the u.s. economy. %$* 13
and they're also arguing that immigration actually is the american story. %$* 13
so i'd like to go to the side that is arguing for the motion, arguing don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses. %$* 13
and tom tancredo, you were talking about the notion that right now we're importing poverty. %$* 13
and i want to ask you, who is welcome? %$* 13
who are the immigrants that are welcome? %$* 13
well, certainly, you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the country in an economic sense. %$* 219
and that is a determination i think that we have made many times during our past. %$* 219
are our needs primarily low-skill, low-wage workers, or are they with high skilled. %$* 219
the people that tamar and the mayor referred to as being these startup companies, these affluent-- %$* 219
or at least people who became affluent, had all these skills, great, fine. %$* 219
it's wonderful. %$* 219
but i'm telling you that that's not what our immigration policy is today. %$* 219
today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification. %$* 219
and because we've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from such low-skilled, low-wage backgrounds that that's who we get. %$* 219
and take 30-- %$* 13
15 seconds to describe the dynamic of family unification. %$* 13
well, sure. %$* 219
it's, if you get here, once you get here and get status here, status as someone here legally, you can begin the process of bringing in your family, bringing in the immediate family then bringing in extended family. %$* 219
and the problem being? %$* 13
being it's coming exactly from the same group of people, the same economic group, especially, that is predominantly low-skilled, low-wage workers when we have, right now, at least-- %$* 219
by the way, this is also legal-- %$* 219
i'm talking legal immigration. %$* 219
as well. %$* 13
let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally. %$* 219
not many of those people have these kinds of skills that you're talking about that are so desperately needed. %$* 219
okay. %$* 13
let's do a response from the other side. %$* 13
julián castro is mayor of san antonio. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 220
first, the argument is built on this idea again that immigrants, both legal and illegal, are somehow soaking up welfare payments and other state subsidies which is not borne out by the evidence. %$* 220
i would also say that last week, folks may have seen this news story. %$* 220
the internal revenue service, the irs, reported that 45 percent of households in this tax year will pay nothing in federal income taxes. %$* 220
so are we to say then that they have no value either because they're not paying any federal income tax. %$* 220
it's interesting that you mention that because, of course, when we also start talking about the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay, there is-- %$* 219
your side suggests that they're paying their fair share. %$* 219
but in reality, they pay nothing in terms of income taxes. %$* 219
most of the people we're talking about end up getting income tax credit and therefore money back from the federal government because again, it's low-skilled, low-wage work. %$* 219
and low-skilled, low-wage people don't pay income taxes. %$* 219
they usually pay-- %$* 219
they pay sales taxes and that sort of thing. %$* 219
but it never balances off with-- %$* 219
julián castro. %$* 13
the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide. %$* 219
julián castro. %$* 13
let's just be precise here. %$* 220
they do pay state income taxes and in some cases federal income taxes. %$* 220
they also pay sales taxes any time they go and buy something. %$* 220
they pay hotel occupancy taxes every time they go to a motel or a hotel. %$* 220
they pay car rental taxes when they rent a car. %$* 220
they pay all types of fees to the government that help the government run and also patronize businesses and spend their money. %$* 220
and they have a tremendous economic impact on every local community. %$* 220
they do. %$* 219
let me ask kris kobach-- %$* 13
that is true. %$* 219
and economic impacts are not positive. %$* 219
tom, let me bring in your-- %$* 13
let me bring in your partner. %$* 13
kris kobach, i just want-- %$* 13
kris, i just want you to respond to what we just heard because i think that's news to a lot of people, a long list of taxes in fact which the immigrants are paying. %$* 13
true or not? %$* 13
it is true that aliens, legal and illegal, of course, pay sales taxes. %$* 221
they indirectly pay property taxes. %$* 221
they may pay some income taxes if they're working under a false social security number. %$* 221
i'm talking about the illegal aliens here. %$* 221
which, by the way, they'll never be able to claim. %$* 219
but the fiscal impact is undisputed. %$* 221
now, there are some economic studies that look at the overall impact. %$* 221
have we cheapened the price of some goods? %$* 221
have we given some economic benefits? %$* 221
but if you narrow it to the fiscal impact, it is undisputed. %$* 221
every single study in the last 10 years, whether you're talking about robert rector's study in 2007 or the census bureau numbers that i related just a moment ago where you have seven, eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs, 51 percent of legal aliens and 39 percent of u.s.citizens, which, by the way, matches up well with that 40 percent figure. %$* 221
it shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits. %$* 221
and if you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers, we're losing on-- %$* 221
okay. %$* 13
let's go to tamar jacoby, your opponent. %$* 13
i mean, again, it all just depends on how you measure it and how you look at it. %$* 222
if you look at it most immigrants pay their taxes to the federal level because they have their income tax withheld from their paycheck. %$* 222
so if you look not just at the state level, but the federal level as well, and you look over their whole lifetimes, they actually pay in about as much as they take out because what costs is health and education-- %$* 222
let me finish. %$* 222
let me finish. %$* 222
the cost is health and education. %$* 222

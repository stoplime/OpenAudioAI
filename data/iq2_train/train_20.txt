america's economy, and future, are not dependent upon the global system. %$* 189
it's the global system that is predicated upon america's willingness to sublimate its market and its military in order to fight a war that ended a generation ago. %$* 189
that is not a safe bet. %$* 189
i mean, really, have you met americans? %$* 189
we kind of shoot from the hip. %$* 189
the world is now dependent upon our mood. %$* 189
and even should we stick to our prozac regimen, the majority of the world's boomers will still retire around 2020, which just as surely will trigger a great depression, if we're lucky. %$* 189
there are many other reasons, similarly inevitable, why the u.s.will remain the global superpower well beyond our lifetimes. %$* 189
the shale revolution has pushed north america within 2 million barrels per day of outright oil independence. %$* 189
and we now have the lowest electricity prices, non- subsidized-- %$* 189
in the world. %$* 189
the u.s.is home to nearly half of global consumer spending, double that of the combined brics. %$* 189
the navy has a 10:1 ratio, conservatively, in terms of global firepower. %$* 189
and the commitment of that imbalance to the global commons is why trade works. %$* 189
and the dollar is the sole denomination for every commodity in every country, especially for those export-driven rivals who are utterly dependent upon free seas and open markets. %$* 189
so, when you think of the u.s., it doesn't matter if you feel a swelling pride, a loathing, or a resigned sigh. %$* 189
your conclusion is as singular as it is clear. %$* 189
bet on america. %$* 189
declinists be damned. %$* 189
thank you, peter zeihan. %$* 13
and that is our motion, declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
and here to argue against that motion, jim rickards. %$* 13
he is chief global strategist at the west shore funds and author of "the death of money: the coming collapse of the international monetary system." ladies and gentlemen, jim rickards. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 191
i want to begin with a simple declarative statement, which is, i love america. %$* 191
i pray for her. %$* 191
and i wish her well. %$* 191
and it's precisely for that reason that i'm here arguing this side, because when you love your country and you see it in decline, when you see a disaster coming, as you do, you really just stand up and say that. %$* 191
and i appreciate the opportunity to talk about that tonight. %$* 191
the second thing i want to say is that almost everything-- %$* 191
practically everything our opponents said is correct, but i would suggest irrelevant. %$* 191
joe was exactly right. %$* 191
no one knows more about the diplomatic history of the last 50 years. %$* 191
but if you had been an observer at the battle of hastings in the morning, you would have said the english had the advantage. %$* 191
they had more troops and higher ground. %$* 191
if you had looked at the battlefield at noon, the english were still winning because they withstood a barrage of arrows from william the conqueror. %$* 191
if you looked at the battlefield about 3:00, the english were still winning because their lines had held. %$* 191
they only had to wait until sundown. %$* 191
it wasn't until shortly before sundown, at the end of the day, in a desperate move, that william the conqueror pulled out some new tactics. %$* 191
the english lines broke, and the course of history was changed forever. %$* 191
my point is, take no comfort from the fact that prior prognostications have not played out, because i think-- %$* 191
i'll explain in a minute why we're in a much more dangerous zone. %$* 191
joe talked about-- %$* 191
described a declinist view involving rhetoric, agitation, and religion. %$* 191
what i'd like to do is-- %$* 191
there's nothing – i have no problem with rhetoric and religion, but let's talk about science for a minute. %$* 191
the most important question in economics and geopolitics today is "are capital markets and is our society a complex system? %$* 191
" if it's not, then maybe our opponents win. %$* 191
but if it is, we have serious problems ahead of us. %$* 191
what do i mean by a "complex system"? %$* 191
a lot of people think, you know, your watch might be complex. %$* 191
it's-- %$* 191
the technical name, "it's complicated, it's not complex." the complex system has the following characteristics. %$* 191
it has diversity, lots of points of view. %$* 191
it has interconnectedness so that those different points of view are in touch with each other. %$* 191
it has communication, so you're communicating, you're transacting, you're interacting with each other. %$* 191
and finally it has adaptability, which is other people's behavior affects your behavior. %$* 191
so, those are the four defining characteristics of a complex system. %$* 191
there is no question, capital markets, finance is not only a complex system, it is the complex system, nonpareil. %$* 191
and this-- %$* 191
again, this is physics, but it applies very carefully, very closely to these economic systems. %$* 191
so, let's just take-- %$* 191
let's just do a thought experiment. %$* 191
we'll use the-- %$* 191
use the audience. %$* 191
we'll use all of you. %$* 191
there are about 500 people in the room. %$* 191
let's say that right now a third of you got up, screamed, and ran out the door as fast as you could. %$* 191
what would the rest of you do? %$* 191
i daresay you'd be right behind them. %$* 191
you wouldn't know what was up. %$* 191
you would say, "well, they know something i don't. %$* 191
the place is on fire. %$* 191
there's a bomb scare. %$* 191
i'm not going to stay around to find out. %$* 191
i'm right behind them." let's say a third of you were particularly nervous. %$* 191
you're more nervous than the rest. %$* 191
for you, it would only take 20 people jumping up, screaming, running out the door, and you would be right behind them. %$* 191
now, let's say there are 20 of us who are the most nervous of all, very, very-- %$* 191
very, very much on edge, and for you it would only take five people standing up, screaming, and running out the door, and you would right-- %$* 191
you would be right behind them. %$* 191
how many people do i have to persuade to empty the whole place, to cause a panic, to cause this whole place to run out the door? %$* 191
the answer is five people, because if five people run, 20 more will run. %$* 191
if 20 run, a third run, and if a third run, the whole audience runs. %$* 191
i like to say when it comes to the collapse of the dollar, paul krugman will be the last guy to leave the room, but that's his problem. %$* 191
but the point is, what i just described, there's a technical name for it, hypersynchronous ising model, but the point is that's a cascade. %$* 191
that's how complex systems operate. %$* 191
it takes very small changes in initial conditions to completely, catastrophically change the outcome. %$* 191
what kind of complex system do we have right now? %$* 191
we have got more debt than we had in 2008. you all remember 2008, too big to fail? %$* 191
well, the biggest banks in 2008 are bigger today. %$* 191
they have a larger concentration of their total financial assets. %$* 191
derivatives books are bigger. %$* 191
in a complex system, when you increase the scale, and that's what i'm talking about, the risk goes up exponentially. %$* 191
so, let's say i increase the derivatives books-- %$* 191
i triple the derivatives books at the major banks, how much did the risk go up? %$* 191
well, if you ask jamie dimon, he would say, “you know, very little because, you know, it's long, short, long, short. %$* 191
it all pairs off. %$* 191
you net it down, it’s a tiny little amount." if you ask my 84-year old mom, she might use intuition and say, "well, if you triple the system, maybe you triple the risk."the correct answer in a complex system, it's exponential function. %$* 191
if you triple the scale of the system, you've increased the risk by a factor of 100 or 1,000.you've made it much more dangerous, and i just showed you how it takes a very small change in the initial conditions to cause the entire thing to collapse. %$* 191
so, that's the system we're living in now. %$* 191
we're right on the knife-edge. %$* 191
very small preservations, very small changes could cause a catastrophic financial collapse. %$* 191
and i'm not talking about the kind of long, slow, gradual decline that joe is expert on. %$* 191
and, you know, peter, no one knows more about this sort of geography of geopolitics than peter. %$* 191
but what are we talking about in the world today? %$* 191
we're not talking about an amphibious invasion on the beaches of new jersey or long island. %$* 191
peter's analysis might have been certainly pertinent in 1860, probably as late as 1960.admiral rogers, who's the head of the united states cyber command, said the next war will be in cyberspace. %$* 191
and my only quibble with admiral rogers is that, that war has already begun. %$* 191
we're in a-- %$* 191
we're in a cyber war with russia right now. %$* 191
in 2010, it was disclosed that russian intelligence had penetrated the nasdaq market operating system with an attack virus. %$* 191
these are not hackers trying to get your credit card numbers. %$* 191
this is-- %$* 191
this is the military intelligence unit getting in the operating system of our second largest stock market. %$* 191
in august 2013 nasdaq was closed for half a day. %$* 191
we've never been offered a explanation as to what happened there. %$* 191
i want to suggest if the explanation was an attack, there would be good reason not to tell us because it would panic investors, start those people running out of the theater exactly as i described. %$* 191
so, this is the situation we're living in today. %$* 191
one last point, what's the r&d budget for fire? %$* 191
how much did it cost to invent fire? %$* 191
the answer is, "zero." the r&d budget was-- %$* 191
somebody had a bright idea someday, maybe they saw some lightning, who knows what, but they invent a fire. %$* 191
what's the payoff to humanity from the invention of fire? %$* 191
incalculable. %$* 191
what was the r&d budget for the boeing 787, the dreamliner? %$* 191
it's $32 billion. %$* 191
what was the improvement? %$* 191
well, i've flown on a 787.i can't tell the difference. %$* 191
it looks like a 767 or a 777.the point is this is characteristics of complex systems. %$* 191
you get to a point where you have larger and larger inputs for no pay off. %$* 191
fire was free, huge benefit. %$* 191
boeing spent $32 billion on a new airline, very hard to see if there's any benefit at all. %$* 191
how are we paying for this? %$* 191
we're printing the money. %$* 191
we're using derivatives. %$* 191
we're creating a dynamically unstable system. %$* 191
it would take very little to cause it to collapse almost overnight. %$* 191
thank you. %$* 191
thank you, jim rickards. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is, "declinists be damned, bet on america." and remember how you voted before the debate-- %$* 13
before the arguments began. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again after closing statements. %$* 13
and once again, the team whose numbers have changed the most from the first to the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and also take questions from me and you and the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this, "declinists be damned: bet on america." and remember how you voted before the debate, before the arguments began, we're going to have you vote again after closing statements. %$* 13
and, once again, the team whose numbers have changed the most from the first to the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and also take questions from me and you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this, "declinists be damned: bet on america." do you want to get a glass of water or-- %$* 13
i got one. %$* 19
yeah, okay. %$* 13
i'm just going to say that again because there would be this lady coughing in the background in the-- %$* 13
remember that thing about editing? %$* 13
we have a-- %$* 13
i just was told by that mysterious voice in my ear that we can get you a cough drop. %$* 13
great. %$* 19
yeah? %$* 13
let's bring up the cough drop. %$* 13
we're going to watch a cough drop brought up on the stage. %$* 13
let's see how this plays out. %$* 13
here you go. %$* 13
i'm just so worked up about american decline. %$* 19
yeah. %$* 13
it's a physical thing for me. %$* 19
i'll let you get that started or-- %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so i'll go ahead and do this one more time. %$* 13
this is nothing compared to some of the stuff that i've had happen to me up here, so-- %$* 13
this is great radio, huh? %$* 18
yeah, yeah. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another in turn and take questions from me and you and the live audience. %$* 13
our motion is this, "declinists be damned: bet on america." we have two teams arguing for and against, the team arguing for, joe joffe, and peter zeihan-- %$* 13
i've said we've heard this whole declinist thing before. %$* 13
it always turns out to be exaggerated, that, in fact, the long term trends are very much in america's favor, strong gdp, its military is supreme without any near rival, other countries that might be rivals just don't have the advantages that the u.s.-- %$* 13
which include access to new talent through immigration, the fact of our education standards, our demographics, which mean that our population will soon be younger than almost any population in the rest of the developed world, we're on our way to energy independence, the dollar is supreme, that things just couldn't really be better, a very optimistic scenario. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, chrystia freeland and jim rickards, much more pessimistic while saying that they argue that with sadness, but that to point out the flaws in the system are-- %$* 13
is, in itself, an act of patriotism. %$* 13
but they say that the system is very fragile, that we're at a state where government is essentially ineffective at a time when capitalism is not working the way it's supposed to be and the middleclass is losing out with no way to get out of the rut that it's in, that the immigration argument is a good one but that we haven't sorted out how we're going to do it, and that economically that conditions are in place for a dangerous and quick and overnight collapse, given the level of debt, which is greater and in more mysterious places than ever before, not to mention that we are very vulnerable in issues of cyber attack. %$* 13
it sounds to me that there are areas in which the two of you agree on some of the basics, for example, the relative strengths and weaknesses internationally between the united states and some of its rivals. %$* 13
but where you appear to disagree i would say is on this notion of whether the team arguing-- %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, arguing not to bet on america, is really portraying a situation in which there's a rot at the core of things. %$* 13
that there's this fragility that over time is going to undermine much of the american dream. %$* 13
and i want to take that side-- %$* 13
or that argument to the side arguing for the motion to get specific. %$* 13
peter zeihan, your opponent, chrystia freeland, argued that the american middleclass is really just in a corner that it can't get out of, both because of the way things are running economically and because of political gridlock, that-- %$* 13
and that-- %$* 13
that they're-- %$* 13
that in itself is the reason that you-- %$* 13
that they can argue right now not to bet on america because of the critical role that the american middleclass has played in building america. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
well, actually, the data doesn't support that. %$* 189
but it's my debate partner that is in command of the data on that topic, so i think i'll punt that one to the right, here. %$* 189
okay, joe joffe, do you want to take that? %$* 13
well, we heard this number about the-- %$* 188
declining middle class for a long time. %$* 188
i don't think it has anything to do with the issue whether the country itself is declining, but let's go with the issue of equality. %$* 188
the way to measure inequality is not by anecdote, but by something called the gini coefficient, which measures inequality around the world. %$* 188
and lo and behold, you'll be surprised. %$* 188
once you take into account taxes and transfers, the united states has a gini coefficient of 0.37.total inequality will be one. %$* 188
zero will be no inequality. %$* 188
the great state of canada has a genie coefficient of 0.34. the great state of germany, the model of the wealthiest state, 0.35. italy almost 0.4. so, if you want to talk inequality, talk the right numbers. %$* 188
do not talk anecdotes and repeat what you read every other day in "the new york times." %$* 188
chrystia. %$* 13
the gini coefficient point. %$* 191
joe said that that was after you take into account taxes and transfers. %$* 191
that's a little like saying it's a nice day except for the three feet of snow. %$* 191
the problem is if you include taxes and transfers this is moving very strongly in the direction of a government run society. %$* 191
so yes, with taxes and transfers. %$* 191
without them, without them our gini coefficient is worse than mexico and when i grew up mexico was a classic oligarchical society. %$* 191
but not taking into account taxes and transfers, we're actually worse than mexico. %$* 191
that's something-- %$* 191
you can’t argue both sides. %$* 188
either you talk inequality or if inequality comes down by government action, isn't that what the welfare state is all about? %$* 188
no. %$* 190
let me-- %$* 190
chrystia freeland. %$* 13
so, it is a truth universally acknowledged, including i am sure by you, joe. %$* 190
that what we have seen over the past 30 years is an increase in inequality in the united states, an increase, a huge increase in the share of income taken by the top 1 percent and 0.1 percent and a stagnation of incomes and wealth of people in the middle. %$* 190
now, i warned you guys he would use the cleanest dirty shirt argument and say well yeah, but it's bad all over. %$* 190
in this case america isn't the cleanest dirty shirt on the stagnate middle class. %$* 190
it is a problem for everybody. %$* 190
i completely agree with that, but it is-- %$* 190
hang on. %$* 190
hang on, joe. %$* 190
hang on, joe. %$* 190
it is a particular problem for the united states for two reasons. %$* 190
the first is we collectively-- %$* 190
i mean, i'm very passionate about this because figuring out how to make the technology revolution 21st century economy work for the middle class, i think, is the biggest challenge of our generation. %$* 190
and for the western world to figure it out, we're going to need a strong american lead and we're going to need america to accept that this is a problem. %$* 190
oh, let's let joe joffe respond. %$* 13
let me respond? %$* 188
yes. %$* 13
i think that the issue of equality is an interesting moral issue, but it has nothing to do with what we're debating about today. %$* 188
we are talking about whether the united states is declining or not relative to other nations. %$* 188
we are not talking about where the united states was 50 or 100 years ago. %$* 188
it was a hell of a lot more unequal in those days. %$* 188
we are talking about by the measures that we normally use to measure power, economy, military, education, research and development spending, scientific achievements. %$* 188
those are the measures as opposed to anecdotes that measure up or down. %$* 188
well, i think the language of the motion does not say relative to other nations. %$* 13
you can make the argument that the motion includes relative to other nations and that's fair and they can convince the audience that it means something else. %$* 13
it's up to you to be persuasive on that. %$* 13
no one in the british empire, the roman empire, the french empire, would say we're going to have a good deal for everybody. %$* 191
what they said is there's rich and poor, elites and everybody else. %$* 191
that was the deal. %$* 191
so yes, we have these other things going for us, but fairness, income distribution, that is the heart of the american dream. %$* 191
when you take that away there's nothing left of america. %$* 191
we are different. %$* 191
peter zeihan. %$* 13
i’ll go now. %$* 189
yeah. %$* 189
i'm sorry, but how much better than the top slot in absolute relative term do you have to be to win this debate? %$* 189
the euro is dissolving as a global currency. %$* 189
three trillion dollars has flooded the united states in the last five years. %$* 189
skilled migration is at all time highs. %$* 189
by every measure that matters the united states has not fallen behind. %$* 189
it's pulling ahead. %$* 189
and that assumes that we keep maintaining a trade system that hasn't benefited us for 30 years. %$* 189
god forbid we have a bad hair day. %$* 189
i'll tell you where america is number one. %$* 191
jim rickards. %$* 13
we're number one in terms of incarceration. %$* 191
the percentage of people behind bars in the united states has doubled. %$* 191
and this is just developed countries. %$* 191
we're not talking about angola here. %$* 191
just the oecd members, the developed countries. %$* 191
america is number 1.number 2 are our friends, chile, who have less than half that rate. %$* 191
turkey is number 10. remember that midnight express? %$* 191
they only have one quarter of incarceration rates. %$* 191
so, that's-- %$* 191
we are number one incarceration, which is a major dysfunction of society. %$* 191
turkey has more-- %$* 188
joe joffe. %$* 13
journalists in jail than any other country in the world that i know of. %$* 188
let me just say something about decline. %$* 188
i think decline is a relative issue. %$* 188
it's not an absolute issue. %$* 188
i am taller or fatter, or thinner than you are. %$* 188
just to say that i'm taller, or fatter, or thinner is not a very interesting issue unless i compare myself to others. %$* 188
well, let's take a moment-- %$* 13
let's take a moment for chrystia freeland to respond to that. %$* 13
is it a relative issue? %$* 13
you said in your opening statement you're comparing it to what we used to be at some point in time. %$* 13
right. %$* 190
but why is their measurement not valid, relative to other nations? %$* 13
a couple of reasons. %$* 190
first of all, i think america rightly measures itself not against turkey. %$* 190
is america supposed to be proud it imprisons fewer journalists than turkey? %$* 190
we have none in prison. %$* 188
i said-- %$* 190
no. %$* 190
no. %$* 190
hey, joe, i didn't interrupt you. %$* 190
so, that's really not good enough. %$* 190
america really is the city on the hill, and america needs to measure itself against itself. %$* 190
i'm arguing decline on two main points. %$* 190
one, america is failing americans. %$* 190
and this is not about some, you know, namby-pamby npr-ish, you know, ethical, moral point. %$* 190
this is about saying the middle class is falling behind. %$* 190
and you talked, peter-- %$* 190
movingly, about generation y. if we talk to the generation y, people here-- %$* 190
there are no good jobs for generation y. generation y is being uber-ized and task rabbit-ized. %$* 190
let's let peter-- %$* 13
and that is a problem. %$* 190
let's let peter zeihan respond-- %$* 13
but before you-- %$* 13
and generation y knows it. %$* 190
before you do that, peter, i just want to point that in celebration of our 100th anniversary, npr has some executives in the audience joining us tonight. %$* 13
i mean, they're thinking things over. %$* 13
peter zeihan. %$* 13
let's talk about america's past. %$* 189
you want to make this relative to the united states's past rather than the rest of the world, that's fine. %$* 189
andrew jackson's wife was accused in a live debate of being a prostitute while she was first lady. %$* 189
gridlock is normal. %$* 189
john adams was accused of being a hermaphrodite with any of the positive characteristics-- %$* 189
whatever the hell that means. %$* 189
gen y doesn't have opportunities? %$* 189
let's take it from the economic side. %$* 189
look back to the 1800s. %$* 189
we had an empty continent that anyone for the price of a kia car could load up the family, head west, take land that we stole from the natives, and be exporting grain for hard currency to war-torn europe within six months. %$* 189
that will never happen again. %$* 189
because there's not another continent. %$* 189
james rickards. %$* 13
jim rickards, please. %$* 13
i'm glad peter brought up andrew jackson. %$* 191
he's one of my favorite presidents for two reasons. %$* 191
number one, he abolished the central bank of the united states. %$* 191
we went for about 80 years with no central bank, thanks to andrew jackson. %$* 191
but the other thing he did-- %$* 191
he paid off the national debt. %$* 191
i don't mean he ran a budget surplus. %$* 191
i mean, there was no national debt. %$* 191
zero. %$* 191
at the end of the jackson administration. %$* 191
today our debt is over 100 percent of gdp. now, the last time it was that high-- %$* 191
and this is sort of joe's point-- %$* 191
you know, it was the end of world war ii.and paul krugman says, "hey, we had a 100 before. %$* 191
no big deal. %$* 191
we got out of it." yeah, but we won world war ii.we had 60 percent of global gdp.today we're declining on a relative basis. %$* 191
we have debt. %$* 191
we didn't get anything for the money. %$* 191
the fed printed the money-- %$* 191
actually the amount of money the fed has printed is roughly equal to the amount of additional debt in the last five years. %$* 191
they have monetized the debt. %$* 191
there is no way out. %$* 191
the-- %$* 191
when this collapses, they'll be-- %$* 191
they won't be-- %$* 191
okay. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
able to do it again. %$* 191
let me take it back to joe joffe. %$* 13
joe joffe, there's sort of a ticking time bomb scenario on the economy? %$* 13
relative decline. %$* 188
and relative decline, by the way-- %$* 188
let me tell you-- %$* 188
of course the united states had 50 percent of gdp and 45.the rest of the world was destroyed. %$* 188
the point is, its share has held steady for the last 50 years. %$* 188
but let me get away from this. %$* 188
let me talk about gridlock, about the inability, you know, the inability to govern. %$* 188
do you know what gridlock looked like in the days of jefferson, when they used to shoot each other? %$* 188
okay. %$* 188
that was just a debating point. %$* 188
let me say something about how, in spite of this so-called gridlock and ungovernability, how this country got out of the great recession? %$* 188
it flooded the country with liquidity. %$* 188
it went into heavy deficit and it recapitalized the banks, this gridlocked country, that totally polarized country, as a result of which this country is now growing at 3 to 4 percent. %$* 188
what about the europeans? %$* 188
i'm sorry to compare the united states to other countries, but where are they in terms of growth now? %$* 188
they've tried something. %$* 188
it doesn't work. %$* 188
do you know with the banking system in china, you just hold a little match to it and it will explode like a nuclear weapon. %$* 188
so-- %$* 13
can i-- %$* 190
chrystia, your argument could be, "the united states is in decline along with everybody else," is what it sounds like? %$* 13
no, no. %$* 18
well, i think-- %$* 190
i think that there is a big problem in how the western industrialized economies are operating, and i think it's partly to do with rent seeking and, you know, the inside dealing and changing the rules of the game to suit elites. %$* 190
i think it's mostly to do with the technology revolution and globalization. %$* 190
and the economy today is not delivering the kind of good middle class jobs which were behind the rise, certainly of america, but also of western europe and canada, in the postwar years. %$* 190
that's gone. %$* 190
we're living through a second industrial revolution, comparable in its scope to the industrial revolution. %$* 190
and you might say to me, "oh, okay, well, that's fine because the industrial revolution, it sort of worked out. %$* 190
and it did, but it took two world wars, a great depression, the long depression in the 19th century, oh, and also a communist revolution in russia and china before we-- %$* 190
50 percent unemployment in southern europe. %$* 189
hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. %$* 190
i didn't interrupt you guys. %$* 190
don't be sexist and speak over women's voices. %$* 190
it happens. %$* 190
i'm sorry. %$* 190
it does happen, okay? %$* 190
so, it-- %$* 190
so communists-- %$* 190
we were on communist revolution-- %$* 190
just really, you know, i can't help you out on that one. %$* 13
yes. %$* 190
studies show it. %$* 190
read sheryl sandburg. %$* 190
anyway, so communist revolutions in russia and china, and then the western world figured out this was a crisis. %$* 190
industrial revolution was great, but you needed a new social and political accommodation so that it worked for the mass of society. %$* 190
okay, no-- %$* 13
and it was-- %$* 190
hang on, hang on-- %$* 190
no, no, now as moderator-- %$* 13
and as a sexist, i'm going to-- %$* 13
we need to do the same thing now. %$* 190
that's why gridlock %$* 190
peter, you're on. %$* 13
peter, you're on. %$* 13
she was being sexist. %$* 18
no, i mean, actually in terms of the-- %$* 189
industrial revolutions, i am in complete agreement. %$* 189
but, wow, if it's going to hurt here, it's going to wreck everybody else. %$* 189
i want to bring up-- %$* 189
go back to a point that-- %$* 189
no, no, no, i actually want you to respond to her point. %$* 13
i did, %$* 189
about how bad-- %$* 13
well, not very eloquently. %$* 13
i mean, she-- %$* 13
she laid out a pretty dire picture of things, and i think we'd like to know where that stands. %$* 13
social development, social revolutions as part of technological change are as old as technology. %$* 189

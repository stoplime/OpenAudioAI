and intelligence squared only exists because of the foundation, the rosenkranz foundation which is making all of this possible. %$* 13
and i would like to introduce, to set the stage for the debate, the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 1
my role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. %$* 1
and tonight's concerns, obviously, obama's jobs plan. %$* 1
congress should approve obama's jobs plan piece by piece, since the whole thing is no longer at issue in the senate. %$* 1
the u.s.economy is cruelly stagnating. %$* 1
unemployment is stubbornly above nine percent. %$* 1
and we risk a serious contraction if europe fails to deal effectively with its own debt crisis. %$* 1
while we do need to address the federal government's fiscal position in the medium term, the short term need is for government to encourage jobs creation. %$* 1
president obama's plan does target the short term, specifically fiscal 2012, with a variety of measures. %$* 1
these include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which is currently in effect. %$* 1
this is economics 101.by decreasing the cost of labor, the payroll tax holiday encourages business to do more hiring. %$* 1
another element of the plan is infrastructure spending, putting construction labor back to work for needed improvements to our roads, bridges, airports and the like. %$* 1
the plan will create 1.9 million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output. %$* 1
where is a counter argument? %$* 1
it's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past, naively hoping for a different result this time. %$* 1
at nearly half a trillion dollars, the plan adds around 40 percent to the already staggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year. %$* 1
even accepting administration claims at face value, it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficit spending to put a single worker in a job for one year. %$* 1
moreover, it's arguable that the extra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions that favor unions and discourage employers. %$* 1
both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow, consumers must have the confidence to spend, and businesses must have the confidence to invest and to hire. %$* 1
will the passage of president obama's proposals restore confidence that our government is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start the economy? %$* 1
or will it destroy confidence by portending higher deficits, higher taxes, higher inflation and a bigger regulatory burden in the years ahead. %$* 1
the decision is yours. %$* 1
and we've assembled here an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide. %$* 1
it's my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i'd just like to invite one more round of applause to robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
true or false, congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece? %$* 13
that's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece. %$* 13
two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it. %$* 13
and only one team will win. %$* 13
and you, our audience here at the skirball center, a packed house, will decide the winner. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
arguing for this motion that congress should pass the jobs plan piece by piece, a former economic advisor to president obama and a professor at princeton university, cecilia rouse. %$* 13
her partner is one of the nation's most prominent economic forecasters, chief economist of moody's analytics, mark zandi. %$* 13
putting the "not" in the proposition, congress should not pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece, this team includes an influential thinker in legal academia, a professor here at new york university's school of law, richard epstein. %$* 13
his partner is a libertarian economist who focuses on tax reform and policy. %$* 13
he's a senior fellow at the cato institute, daniel mitchell. %$* 13
now, this is the debate. %$* 13
one side will win, and one side will lose. %$* 13
and you, our live audience, will pick the winners. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared the winner. %$* 13
so let's now establish the baseline. %$* 13
we're going to go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to those key pads at your seat, the way that it works, there are a lot of buttons on it. %$* 13
pay attention to numbers one, two and three. %$* 13
if you agree at this point with this motion that congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece, push number one. %$* 13
if you are against this motion, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you feel that you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in the last vote. %$* 13
so as the end of the debate, we will reveal this number that we're registering now and the second number. %$* 13
and by that, you will pick our winner. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so we go in three rounds. %$* 13
and round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece." and here to argue for that motion, mark zandi. %$* 13
he is chief economist of moody's analytics where he directs research and consulting. %$* 13
he is cofounder of economy.com and the author of the book "financial shock." he is also interestingly enough, mark, i notice that on the white house blog where they are defending this plan, they cite, when they talk about independent points of view, mark zandi. %$* 13
well, i must be right then. %$* 17
well, it would be very interesting to see you agree with yourself tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, mark zandi. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 17
thank you, john, thank you intelligence squared for the opportunity to be here. %$* 17
and it is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals. %$* 17
it's an honor to be here. %$* 17
i'm going to make four points in my opening remarks. %$* 17
point number one is that i think there are a number of different reasons for why the obama jobs plan should be passed. %$* 17
i'm not going to go through all of them. %$* 17
cece's going to go through some of her reasoning. %$* 17
but for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a recession. %$* 17
and the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't. %$* 17
the economy is obviously struggling. %$* 17
this is very obvious by looking at the job market. %$* 17
if you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average. %$* 17
just for context, we need almost double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment. %$* 17
and unemployment is already 9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher. %$* 17
this is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune from where we were at the start of the year. %$* 17
i mean, it's hard to remember back, but just think about january, february, march, april. %$* 17
we were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs per month. %$* 17
and i was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects. %$* 17
but we got nailed by a number of what i call unfortunate events. %$* 17
in fact, john, i say they're unpredictable, largely because i didn't predict them. %$* 17
higher energy prices due in part to the arab spring and the libyan conflict, and even with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred, 125 billion more on gasoline this year than last. %$* 17
and by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year. %$* 17
so we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank. %$* 17
it didn't provide the juice that we were hoping for, but i think it forced all the recession, very helpful. %$* 17
the japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth. %$* 17
but i think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what i consider very egregious policy errors. %$* 17
most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate. %$* 17
i think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment. %$* 17
it's not that people are pulling back yet. %$* 17
it's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs. %$* 17
but they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're in. %$* 17
i do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the odds of recession are very serious. %$* 17
in fact, i think they're better than even. %$* 17
because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from gdp growth. %$* 17
gdp is the value of all the things that we produce. %$* 17
they'll cut 1.7 percentage points from gdp growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost a couple percentage points. %$* 17
the good economy, a solid economy that's growing strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint. %$* 17
a weak economy, the economy that we're in today, i think would be pushed into recession. %$* 17
so we've got to make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is currently. %$* 17
point number two, i think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to date has been effective. %$* 17
i think it succeeded. %$* 17
the purpose of physical stimulus is not to provide a source of long term economic growth. %$* 17
it's about ending the recession. %$* 17
in fact, the recovery act-- %$* 17
this is the stimulus that most people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of the obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- %$* 17
a few days. %$* 17
the recovery act was passed in mid-late february '09.and by the way, in february '09 we lost 750,000 jobs. %$* 17
the economy was in freefall. %$* 17
by june the economy was growing again, gdp, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the recession was over by february 2010, one year later. %$* 17
we were creating jobs. %$* 17
and over the past year and a half since february 2010, we've created well over two million jobs. %$* 17
it's not good enough but in the-- %$* 17
i think the counterfactual is here-- %$* 17
here is a much more serious recession. %$* 17
in my view, we would've suffered a depression. %$* 17
the stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession, jump starting an economic recovery. %$* 17
third point-- %$* 17
did i tell you how many points i was going to make? %$* 17
four. %$* 17
the third point-- %$* 17
just testing, making sure you're paying attention-- %$* 17
third point is that the obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years, 250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in temporary spending increases. %$* 17
you know, not all of the pieces of the package are made equal. %$* 17
in my view, the most important element of the plan is the extension of the payroll tax holiday for workers. %$* 17
if we do not extend that, taxes for everyone will rise on january 1, 2012, and again, given this economy, that would be a very significant problem. %$* 17
there are elements of the plan that are really quite creative, some of which cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and hire people. %$* 17
there are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that i think has wide bipartisan support, and there's some really creative elements with respect to infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure, and the most important thing you should know, it is all paid for. %$* 17
this is not a deficit of finance. %$* 17
it will be paid for by-- %$* 17
at this point, the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people who make a million dollars a year. %$* 17
now, that's a negative. %$* 17
i don't like raising taxes on anybody, but i think that's a modest negative in the context of, again, not going back into recession. %$* 17
and finally, point number four, this is very important, the jobs bill is only one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track. %$* 17
we also need long term economic policy, but we have-- %$* 17
congress and the administrative have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal, and we need tax reform. %$* 17
so we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code, make it fairer, less complex, and put our businesses on solid ground. %$* 17
so this is only the start of what we need to do. %$* 17
it's not the end. %$* 17
i want to thank you very much for your kind attention. %$* 17
we just can't go back into recession. %$* 17
obama's job plan will ensure that we don't. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
four. %$* 388
four. %$* 17
the third point-- %$* 17
just testing, making sure you're paying attention-- %$* 17
third point is that the obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years, 250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in temporary spending increases. %$* 17

it's not the end. %$* 17
i want to thank you very much for your kind attention. %$* 17
we just can't go back into recession. %$* 17
obama's job plan will ensure that we don't. %$* 17
thank you. %$* 17
thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
our motion is "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to speak first against the motion, daniel mitchell. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the cato institute where he focuses on tax reform and supplied side tax policy. %$* 13
in his past, he was an economist for senator bob packwood and the senate finance committee. %$* 13
and, dan, you do these videos online that i've seen where you explain economics to the masses. %$* 13
i want to compliment you on your delivery-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 389
as from inside the business. %$* 13
it's excellent. %$* 13
i was taken with your discussion of government spending in which you said that in the end you feel that the real reason that government spending happens, you say, "i suspect it's because politicians just love spending other people's money," but you worked for a politician? %$* 13
yes, but i've reformed. %$* 389
you-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel mitchell. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 389
it’s a real honor to be here, especially with such a distinguished group of co-panelists. %$* 389
as a matter of fact, i think what am i doing here? %$* 389
i’m sort of like the sat answer, one of these things is not like the other. %$* 389
but hopefully, since i am representing the cato institute, i want to give people a very good impression about what libertarian philosophy of left government and individual freedom is all about. %$* 389
and the way richard and i are going to divide up our responsibility, i’m going to look at sort of the macro issues of stimulus and keynesianism and obama’s jobs act. %$* 389
and he’s going to look at some of the nitty gritty details. %$* 389
that of course enables me to do the easy part and him to do the hard part. %$* 389
and i want to divide my part up, the macro part looking first at the theory and then at the evidence. %$* 389
now keynesians say that whenever the economy’s weak, the government should borrow money, spend the money, or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or fashion. %$* 389
the goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in people’s pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy. %$* 389
and that sounds very plausible. %$* 389
it makes sense. %$* 389
we’re all going to have money in our pockets. %$* 389
we’re going to go out and spend money. %$* 389
that has to do something good for the economy. %$* 389
there’s only one little problem with the theory. %$* 389
where does the government get the money? %$* 389
government can print money. %$* 389
government can borrow money. %$* 389
government can tax money. %$* 389
but there’s no way the government can put money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the economy. %$* 389
and what is it that we’re trying to do? %$* 389
what is a recession? %$* 389
a recession means that our gdp, which used to be this much, is now this much. %$* 389
this by the way is a west virginia powerpoint slide here. %$* 389
what is it that we want to do? %$* 389
what is economic growth? %$* 389
economic growth means we’re going to take this gdp and we want it to be higher. %$* 389
but what is keynesianism? %$* 389
what is stimulus at least as it’s defined inside washington? %$* 389
stimulus inside washington is well let’s money from the economy’s right pocket and put it in the economy’s left pocket. %$* 389
but are we doing anything to increase this blob called gdp? %$* 389
no, we’re not. %$* 389
my contention is that what keynesianism does is it redistributes national income, usually in ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become santa claus and buy votes, but our goal should be not to redistribute national income; we want to increase national income. %$* 389
we want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice, that’s what economic growth is all about. %$* 389
let me give you an example that i think makes this clear. %$* 389
this is actually a quiz. %$* 389
it’s not like the thing where you get to vote twice. %$* 389
by the way, if you let them vote five times, you could rename this chicago. %$* 389
a little quiz that will determine whether or not you’re qualified to be a member of congress. %$* 389
let’s divide this room in half. %$* 389
let’s borrow all the money out of the pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of the room. %$* 389
now here’s the quiz. %$* 389
raise your hand if you think there’s more money in the room. %$* 389
i’m sorry, none of you are allowed to be in washington because you have failed your elementary test on keynesian economics. %$* 389
and if you look at what’s happened. %$* 389
if you look at the evidence for keynesian economics, for stimulus, whatever you want to call it, what do we find? %$* 389
i don’t think we find very good results. %$* 389
you can go back to the 1930s, hoover and roosevelt were both keynesians. %$* 389
hoover increased government spending by 47 percent in just four years, that was a period of deflation so it was actually more than 50 percent in real terms. %$* 389
the economy didn’t do any better. %$* 389
roosevelt in eight years, from 32 to 40, increased government spending by more than 100 percent. %$* 389
unemployment stayed high, the economy stayed in recession. %$* 389
now, let me give a little bit of humility, first, on behalf of all economists. %$* 389
if you ask five economists a question, you’ll get nine answers .we have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions. %$* 389
we’re not very good at these things. %$* 389
and especially when you’re looking at something like the overall macro economy. %$* 389
there’s trade policy, there’s regulatory policy, there’s labor policy, monetary policy. %$* 389
there are all of these different things going on in the economy, not to mention some of the exogenous factors that mark talked about. %$* 389
earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, oil price shocks, you name it. %$* 389
and now we’re expecting to look at one little slice of all of these different policy levers, fiscal policy, and we’re supposed to make sweeping judgments about what exactly it means. %$* 389
of course at best all we’re really doing is guessing. %$* 389
but if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like hoover and roosevelt increasing government spending, it doesn’t seem to have worked. %$* 389
but it’s not just the 1930s. %$* 389
gerald ford had a keynesian tax rebate package in the 1970s. %$* 389
it didn't work. %$* 389
japan has had, by some accounts, 16 different stimulus packages since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s. %$* 389
those haven't worked. %$* 389
bush had a keynesian stimulus package in 2008.it didn't work. %$* 389
and then, of course, obama more recently has done the same thing. %$* 389
and time after time after time we don't seem to be getting very good results. %$* 389
now, i'm not up here to make partisan points at all. %$* 389
what i think of policies that have not worked very well, you'll notice that i've listed republican administrations and democratic administrations. %$* 389
but if you ask me what should happened, if you ask me for the success story, i look at things such as the clinton years and the reagan years. %$* 389
and this should make cecilia happy because she worked for the clinton administration before working for the obama administration. %$* 389
she did a good job her first time around. %$* 389
her second time, maybe not so much. %$* 389
but if you look at what happened during the reagan years and the clinton years, and you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the frazier institute, economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the heritage foundation, their economic freedom of the world index, or the world economic forum's global competitiveness report, you will see that during the reagan years, during the clinton years, you had more economic liberalization, more freedom, a reduced burden of government spending. %$* 389
and that's why i think we got better economic results during those periods. %$* 389
now, i'm running out of time, so let me go ahead and say something about what should happen, because obviously i'm up here trying to convince you to vote against the motion. %$* 389
in some sense, politicians should follow the hippocratic oath. %$* 389
first, do no harm. %$* 389
and i do worry that when politicians, especially driven by that short- term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases, oh, we're doing something. %$* 389
they want to show that, oh, we care. %$* 389
you know, what was that, the first president bush went up to new hampshire in '92, message, "i care."i mean, boy, talk about an empty, vacuous statement to make. %$* 389
but that's how most politicians think. %$* 389
they really are driven by this desire to try to demonstrate to voters that they really are concerned about your best interests, when in reality, in many cases, at least part of their decision making is driven by their desire to get more votes. %$* 389
so i don't want-- %$* 389
thank you very much. %$* 389
thank you. %$* 389
daniel mitchell, your time up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 389
thank you. %$* 389
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
and we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing out this motion: "congress should pass obama's job plan piece by piece." you've heard the first two debaters and now onto the third. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, i'd like to introduce cecilia rouse. %$* 13
she's a professor of economics and public affairs at princeton university's woodrow wilson school. %$* 13
from 2009 to 2011, she was on the inside. %$* 13
she served as a member of the president's council of economic advisors. %$* 13
and cecilia, i want to ask you about thanksgiving at your house, because i understand you have a physicist father and a physicist brother, and you're an economist and three phds. %$* 13
maybe there's a fourth one in the family somewhere. %$* 13
so what, do you talk numbers and formula all through-- %$* 13
actually, there is a fourth phd, my sister who is also a professor at princeton, actually. %$* 390
but she's in anthropology. %$* 390
so dan hamermesh who is a professor of economics at texas, says, let me think. %$* 390
your father was a theoretical physicist. %$* 390
your brother's an experimental physicist. %$* 390
you're an economist, and your sister's an anthropologist. %$* 390
you're getting weaker as you go. %$* 390
ladies and gentlemen, cecilia rouse. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 390
it really is a pleasure to be here tonight. %$* 390
and, you know, dan really said it right when you said you have five economists, you really only get nine opinions. %$* 390
i think you get many more. %$* 390
i was in the clinton administration. %$* 390
those were good years in the '90s. %$* 390
i think many people might interpret those times, though as that the federal reserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the federal reserve was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetary policy-- %$* 390
the federal reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth. %$* 390
in contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a fed that cannot do as much as it normally can in normal times. %$* 390
interest rates are near zero. %$* 390
it's near zero, lower bound. %$* 390
you can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to have more fiscal policy. %$* 390
but my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures. %$* 390
i'm a labor economist. %$* 390
i got into economics because i was worried about the unemployed, and i still am. %$* 390
there are 14 million workers in the united states who are unemployed. %$* 390
half of them have been unemployed for more than six months. %$* 390
there are another two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given up looking. %$* 390
and there's about nine million who are working part time, but who would actually like to work full time. %$* 390
so they're working part time for economic reasons. %$* 390
we've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth. %$* 390
but we've also had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth. %$* 390
and as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small r.it's just fledgling. %$* 390
and as mark pointed out i'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far enough along. %$* 390
now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose for us going forward. %$* 390
when workers become displaced, they do not earn-- %$* 390
they have, going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10 to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement. %$* 390
it has impact on their children. %$* 390
their children get lower levels of schooling going forward. %$* 390
it is going to affect the earnings of their children. %$* 390
and look at all of the young people today who are finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even getting started into the labor force. %$* 390
so we know that these have the potential to really hold back economic growth going forward. %$* 390
so yes, i support the obama plan. %$* 390
i support any plan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another double-dip recession or having more downturn. %$* 390
now look, last year, i was at the council of economic advisors. %$* 390
and things were looking a lot better. %$* 390
and as a result, if you listened to the president's state of the union, what he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but were really towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation. %$* 390
and i believe that they are very important. %$* 390
and we all believe that. %$* 390
but we don't have the economy today that we had just six, nine months ago. %$* 390
and therefore, i think the time is right for congress to act. %$* 390
now, let's first talk about the pillars of what-- %$* 390
the major components of this plan and what it would do. %$* 390
so first of all, about 40 percent of it is putting money in the hands of individuals. %$* 390
okay. %$* 390
some people may say, well, look, that's putting money in their pockets. %$* 390
they're not doing much. %$* 390
but let's talk about it. %$* 390
so the tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned about $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, i should say. %$* 390
it was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more. %$* 390
it continues the federally funded unemployment insurance benefits. %$* 390
now, let's talk about that. %$* 390
six million workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits. %$* 390
they lost their job through no fault of their own. %$* 390
these benefits are not helping them live high on the hog. %$* 390
it's only replacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320 a week. %$* 390
and we know that that's about a third of the family income. %$* 390
it helps them to pay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table. %$* 390
it helps them to support their local businesses, et cetera. %$* 390
and that's the way in which it helps to support the economy. %$* 390
the congressional budget office has said that these sorts of benefits are one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short term. %$* 390
important we can talk more about this. %$* 390
i know many believe that this is not the time to continue-- %$* 390
to continue these sorts of benefits. %$* 390
and i would argue this is exactly the time to do so. %$* 390
it also-- %$* 390
let's face it, the private sector is the most important source of job growth in this country. %$* 390
they provide 80 percent of the jobs. %$* 390
so another part of this is-- %$* 390
this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs program. %$* 390
it's about trying to stand up the private sector. %$* 390
so another 20 percent or so are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business. %$* 390
so i teach microeconomics. %$* 390
firms do business by having labor and capital. %$* 390
i hope that's as geeky as i get tonight. %$* 390
and there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as lowering costs of hiring workers. %$* 390
again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the employee but to the employer now. %$* 390
and it also provides an extra incentive for firms to bring on more workers. %$* 390
and lastly, as i mentioned before-- %$* 390
all of those should help in the next year. %$* 390
but we know we're going to be in this for a little while. %$* 390
it takes a while to recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector. %$* 390
and so 20 percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually one of the pillars of economic growth. %$* 390
now, as mark mentioned, there are some innovations in the way some of this money would be spent. %$* 390
in terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states to provide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers. %$* 390
there is encouraging states to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying off workers and keeping some-- %$* 390
they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporary downturn, through work sharing. %$* 390
it encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging states, some of which already have them, including my own state of new jersey-- %$* 390
help making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their business while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they currently are not technically allowed to do. %$* 390
and it also starts an infrastructure bank which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of these public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of a return in order to do. %$* 390
so i think that it's a balanced package, and i think it hits a lot of the right parts. %$* 390
as mark mentioned, it's paid for. %$* 390
we can talk more about the way it's paid for. %$* 390
you know, the current idea on the table is senator reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03 percent of american taxpayers. %$* 390
so, in closing, yes, i support a program that will provide support to this economy today because i am very worried about how families are getting by. %$* 390
we have 46 million families living in poverty. %$* 390
i'm worried that our recovery is fragile. %$* 390
this doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have more robust growth going forward, but i just don't happen to believe that these aren't mutually exclusive. %$* 390
maybe hope springs eternal, but i think that congress can walk and chew gum at the same time, thank you. %$* 390
thank you, cecilia rouse. %$* 13
our motion is "congress should pass obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and now here to speak against the motion, i'd like to introduce richard epstein. %$* 13
he's a professor of law here at new york university law school, a senior fellow at the hoover institution, and a professor of law emeritus and senior lecturer at the university of chicago where, interestingly enough, given the context, a colleague you used to bump into in the hallways, an adjunct professor was named barack obama-- %$* 13
yes, he was-- %$* 391
and i understand you knew him a little bit, and you're quoted as saying that you found him to be an amazingly talented intellectual-- %$* 13
amazingly talented at playing intellectual poker, which, to me, sounds pretty cool. %$* 13
it's very cool. %$* 391
it was very difficult to read the man, and that's why it was that he was such a great poker player. %$* 391
but the question is not whether he could play poker, it's whether or not the statute that he proposes is one that will do the things that we want it to do. %$* 391
and in this debate, there is no disagreement over the sad state of the american economy and the need for something to be done. %$* 391
the question is how it should be done, what should be done, and why. %$* 391
and i'm a lawyer, and i'm with three economists, and i have at least one comparative advantage or disadvantage as the case may be, i actually spent time reading the statute to see what it says in order to figure out whether or not the pieces make any sense. %$* 391
and it's interesting that you can talk about this at the macro level, but it's also extremely important to talk about it at the micro level, and so let me tell you some of the pieces which i think are positively self destructive and ought never to see the light of day. %$* 391
one of the truly misguided features of the stimulus program of 2009 was the passage of arra, the american recovery and reinvestment act, which instituted a whole variety of buy american provisions in the bill with respect to those funds which were to be distributed through the government to various kinds of employees. %$* 391
if you look at the kinds of provisions that are created there, it's a massive bureaucracy which is designed to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted. %$* 391
it is the kind of thing which says that you cannot buy from sensible foreign providers if they are expensive and inefficient american providers, then there are huge amounts of administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed. %$* 391
the whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program, and it will turn it into a waste. %$* 391
a similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of hoover's legislation, the davis-bacon act, saying that when the government gives this kind of money out, you have to pay prevailing i.e. %$* 391
union wages with respect to the money in question. %$* 391
so the stimulus program seems to say, "the way in which you get the most for your money is to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can," and there's no way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to the legislation in question. %$* 391
a third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an anti-discrimination act which says that you cannot discriminate against people who are unemployed when you decide whom to hire. %$* 391
that of course is an extremely complicated provision. %$* 391
it has about four separate pages to it, and there's an exception which says that, "yes, you can take into account their job record under these circumstances." so any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running-- %$* 391
exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits. %$* 391
but of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire somebody who's already employed, that opens up a position for somebody else. %$* 391
so what you have to understand is at these particular levels, all of the micromanagement is counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question. %$* 391
then the next thing that we've heard about, and was praised mightily, was the payroll reduction tax for a single year, and what happens is we know what's wrong with this tax because we've been told so by our opponents in this case. %$* 391
employers are not people who are foolish. %$* 391
they understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run, they don't only look at this year's rates, they look at next year's rates as well. %$* 391
our objective with respect to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth. %$* 391
we cannot do that, say, to people-- %$* 391
hire people this year, train them for 26 weeks, and then when you get to next year, what's going to happen is you're going to go back to the higher rates of taxation. %$* 391
people will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to achieve. %$* 391
you must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is going to be able to succeed. %$* 391
any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed to failure. %$* 391
there is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion. %$* 391
so then the question comes, and i’ll talk about this for the remainder of my time, what is it that we ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons that the obama tax plan is doomed to failure? %$* 391
and it seems to me what we have to do is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic policy. %$* 391
so as a lawyer in particular, one of things that impresses me is at the same time we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect to macro policies, we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed. %$* 391
so if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question, just take for example, as one particular, the decision of the administration to chase after the boeing company with respect to its decision to locate a plant in columbus-- %$* 391
or charleston rather, south carolina. %$* 391
the net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down, an employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be faced with a government prosecution. %$* 391
this is not an incentive to create new plants and new jobs. %$* 391
in effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers, over jobs in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place. %$* 391
when you start looking at the other micro things, for example, in 2005, what we decided to do was to raise the minimum wages. %$* 391
and it seemed to be a fine thing because those were optimistic days. %$* 391
but if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same time that the minimum wage is moved up, what’s going to happen is at the lower level you’re going to find that it’s very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job. %$* 391
and the point that was already said, namely if you don’t get the first job, you’ll not get the second and third job is in fact something which has been done. %$* 391
so this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the circumstances of this case. %$* 391
and the list can go on. %$* 391
the government has decided that what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been filed with the national labor relations board. %$* 391
if you’re a small business trying to go in, it’s just a wonderful thing to note that after you’ve been in business for three or four weeks, all of a sudden you’re hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize, you’d better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands. %$* 391
there is no way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that you’re trying to subsidize it at the top. %$* 391
and also there is at present, the obama legislation which is essentially designed to create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to predicate itself upon the employment relationship. %$* 391
and these again are implicit taxes. %$* 391
so the final message that i want to leave you with is this. %$* 391
the way to deal with labor problems is not to talk about earthquakes; it’s to talk about labor markets. %$* 391
and the way to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances to get gains from trade, they will return to the hiring market. %$* 391
thank you. %$* 391
thank you richard epstein. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared us debate where our motion is "congress should pass obama’s jobs plan piece by piece." remember we had you vote before the debate to tell us where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
we’ll have you vote again at the end of the debate asking as which side you feel argued best and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so now on to round two where i ask questions to the debaters. %$* 13
they address one another. %$* 13
we take questions from you. %$* 13
our motion is "congress should pass obama’s jobs plan piece by piece." we have two teams of debaters. %$* 13
we have cecilia roust and mark zandi who are presenting the argument in favor of this motion and in favor of the jobs plan, arguing that they feel that it is absolutely critical to avoiding another recession. %$* 13
that workers who are not floating, who are sinking, are going to lead to no growth in the economy and if anything, a step backward, that this program at a minimum, at a minimum puts a stop in there. %$* 13
arguing against them, richard epstein and daniel mitchell who argue that this is essentially another stimulus plan, that historically stimulus plans do not work and that it is rife with all kinds of bureaucratic induction of distorted enhancements that will make it difficult for businessmen simply to hire people and make decisions going forward. %$* 13
and therefore, if it were passed, it would never work. %$* 13
that’s where the two sides stand on this. %$* 13
and i want to start with the question to the side arguing for the motion and to mark zandi. %$* 13
with your opponents arguments very strenuously. %$* 13
but essentially this is a stimulus program, and i think you agree with that, and you're saying that, in your argument, that this is needed to avoid a recession. %$* 13
and you have argued that stimulus programs have already worked in this administration in doing good. %$* 13
i wanted you to take on their argument that historically, that's not the case at all. %$* 13
well, i don't think that's true. %$* 17
i think fiscal stimulus is a tried and true policy response to recession. %$* 17
since every recession since world war ii, we've had fiscal stimulus. %$* 17
in fact, the degree of fiscal stimulus provided is commensurate with the severity of the recession, at least as measured by the unemployment rate. %$* 17
and in fact, one could argue that the fiscal stimulus that was provided in this recession, the great recession, was inadequate. %$* 17
it was not proportional to the severity of the recession. %$* 17
and that's one of the reasons why the economy hasn't engaged to the degree that i think most would have thought at this point. %$* 17
moreover, i'm not alone in this view. %$* 17
cece brought up the congressional budget office. %$* 17
the cbo is a nonpartisan group respected by both republicans and democrats. %$* 17
they score the various proposals made by policy makers, tax policy and spending policy. %$* 17
and they do studies of various stimulus packages. %$* 17
and they released the estimates on the impact on gdp, on jobs, unemployment on a regular basis and they show consistently that they believe that this had been-- %$* 17
okay. %$* 13
a plus to the economy. %$* 17
so you're saying it's a mainstream view. %$* 13
i'd like to bring it to richard epstein on the other side. %$* 13
look, i think in effect we've seen the results already. %$* 391
at the time that the obama administration introduced its first stimulus program, there was a confident prediction supported by the cbo that it would lower the unemployment rate down to eight percent. %$* 391
nothing of the sort happened. %$* 391
it stayed exactly dead level under the circumstances. %$* 391

i want to welcome to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi. %$* 1
so, bob, in all of the debates we put on, we try to-- %$* 13
we try to pick issues where there's some kind of real tradeoff. %$* 13
and in this debate, what are the tradeoffs that we're talking about? %$* 13
well, the major one here: of course, the fda's job is to see that drugs that come on the market are both effective and safe. %$* 1
and that's a worthy goal. %$* 1
but the longer it takes to get a drug approved, the more arduous that process, the more people don't get the drug who might need it, in some cases, with absolutely dire or fatal consequences. %$* 1
so there are huge costs to delay, just as there are huge benefits to protecting the market from unsafe drugs. %$* 1
this agency that we're talking about, the federal-- %$* 13
food and drug administration, has roots that go back to 1906, teddy roosevelt era. %$* 13
science was at a different place then. %$* 13
how much is the advancement of science actually part of what this debate is about? %$* 13
well, i think the advance of science is a very key part of the debate because so many of the drug therapies operate-- %$* 1
today operate on a molecular level, where our genetic composition is an important determinant of how the drug is going to affect our bodies. %$* 1
and that means that the old paradigm of trying to figure out a drug that does good for everybody and harm to very few people is really kind of outmoded. %$* 1
the better paradigm today is the really custom-tailored drug that takes one's own individual genetic composition into effect. %$* 1
and the pro the motion side is probably going to say that the fda simply hasn't adapted to that degree of scientific advance. %$* 1
what about the other side? %$* 13
well, the other side is going to say this requires larger tasks, bigger sample groups, more amount of time to really winnow out these individual differences in response. %$* 1
well, we have four debaters who have not only been arguing this debate, but some of them have actually been involved with the fda directly. %$* 13
so they're going to know what they're talking about. %$* 13
and let's welcome them to the stage. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
you're all doing great with the applause requirement. %$* 13
and because of that, i just want to ask you one more time to give a round of applause to bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so you open up a bottle of a prescription drug that your doctor told you you need to take to get better, that little brown bottle. %$* 13
you've got the pill in your hand, and you're putting it on your tongue, and you're about to swallow it when you hear a disturbingly familiar voice in your head. %$* 13
and that voice says this: "you should not take this drug if you're not able to stand up or sit upright for 30 minutes, have severe kidney disease, low blood calcium or are allergic. %$* 13
call your doctor right away if you develop new or worsening heartburn, difficult or painful swallowing or chest pain. %$* 13
if you develop severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain. %$* 13
side effects in studies were generally mild and include stomach pain, indigestion, heart burn, or nausea." and what is that? %$* 13
that is fda speak. %$* 13
that is the voice of uncle sam, uncle sam actually in the form of the food and drug administration telling you to be careful to exercise caution because that is the mission of the food and drug administration going back more than 70 years. %$* 13
but what if, as some say, the fda is actually going too far, is overdoing it, is actually causing harm? %$* 13
well, that sounds like a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against the motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
our debate, as always, goes in three rounds. %$* 13
and then the audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
first, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
he's a physician and former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
his partner is peter huber. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
on the side arguing against the motion, that-- %$* 13
arguing the fda's caution is not hazardous to our health, we'd like to introduce jerry avorn. %$* 13
he is a professor of medicine at harvard medical school. %$* 13
and his partner is david challoner, vice president for health affairs emeritus at the university of florida. %$* 13
our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion first. %$* 13
let's welcome, again, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
and scott, you are a physician. %$* 13
you are a former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
you've worn a lot of your hats in career-- %$* 13
the jobs at the fda.you're a doctor. %$* 13
you've also been an analyst on wall street at one point. %$* 13
i'm curious. %$* 13
what about medical school prepared you for wall street? %$* 13
anatomy class? %$* 13
i had to make important decisions based on imperfect information. %$* 295
ah. %$* 13
that is a very, very clever answer. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
and scott, your partner is? %$* 13
the always provocative peter huber. %$* 295
ladies and gentlemen, peter huber. %$* 13
peter, you are also arguing for the motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
you're a senior fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
speaking of people doing a lot of different things, you have a doctorate in mechanical engineering from mit.you have clerked for ruth bader ginsburg and sandra day o'connor. %$* 13
you write about energy and technology. %$* 13
your forthcoming book, “the cure in the code,” is about drug policy. %$* 13
what have you not that you still need to get to in life? %$* 13
well, mostly, i'm just hoping to overcome my intellectual attention deficit disorder. %$* 101
ladies and gentlemen, peter huber-- %$* 13
who claims to have attention deficit disorder. %$* 13
i think not. %$* 13
our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
and here to argue against the motion-- %$* 13
first, let's welcome jerry avorn. %$* 13
jerry, you hold the position at the department of medicine at brigham & women's hospital as chief of the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics. %$* 13
would it take you an hour to explain to us what those things mean? %$* 13
no. %$* 296
it is the study of balancing the risks and benefits and cost of medications as they're used in routine care of patients. %$* 296
nine seconds. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jerry avorn. %$* 13
and jerry, your partner is? %$* 13
oh, david challoner. %$* 296
ladies and gentlemen, david challoner. %$* 13
david challoner is vice president emeritus for health affairs at the university of florida. %$* 13
david, you did medical school. %$* 13
you got your md.but then you decided to spend your career not seeing patients day in and day out, but to go into the research side. %$* 13
why did research pull you? %$* 13
i went to harvard. %$* 297
my faculty told me i had to. %$* 297
and in those days, you did what the faculty told you to do. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david challoner. %$* 13
our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
as always, we have you, the audience, choose our winner by your vote. %$* 13
and we have you vote twice: before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team whose percentage numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's go to our first vote. %$* 13
if you go to those keypads at your seat-- %$* 13
i'll restate the motion. %$* 13
and if i-- %$* 13
as i restate it, you say, “i agree with that,” you push #1.and if you disagree, you push #2.and if you're undecided, which is a perfectly honorable position, by the way, you push #3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
so, i'll wait 10 or 15 seconds while everybody does that vote. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it looks like it was handled well. %$* 13
so let's move on to the actual debate. %$* 13
and again, i'll remind you, we'll have you vote at the very end. %$* 13
and in terms of how long it takes to get the results, it's under a minute. %$* 13
so it'll be very quick turnaround at the end. %$* 13
onto round 1.opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
the motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
and here, speaking first for this motion, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
he is a practicing physician, a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute, and former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 295
to understand why fda's caution is hazardous to our health, you have to appreciate fda's growing focus on statistical outcomes over results for patients. %$* 295
fading at fda is a mindset of clinical medicine and patient care. %$* 295
and in it is a growing fixation on the statistical results, clinical trials, and a growing rule by math over medicine. %$* 295
this mindset can be seen in the triage that now hamper clinical trials and drug development. %$* 295
fda imposes increasingly onerous experiments to try to ferret out benefits from new drugs. %$* 295
and fda reviewers want the results of clinical trials to insulate them from critics; critics who say they're not doing enough about drug safety. %$* 295
but the laborious trials that result come at a very big, human cost. %$* 295
higher degrees of statistical certainty under fda's outdated way of designing drug trials require longer, larger, and increasingly impractical studies, especially when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs. %$* 295
some promising therapies simply aren't being developed. %$* 295
let me tell you one story of how this mindset impacts patients. %$* 295
hunter's syndrome is part of a family of related and extremely rare disorders. %$* 295
all are inherited. %$* 295
each robs children of the ability to produce a crucial enzyme that's used by the body to break down certain sugar molecules found in the blood. %$* 295
missing these enzymes, these molecules end up accumulating in places like the liver, and the spleen, and the joints, with often painful and debilitating consequences. %$* 295
before treatment came along, parents had to literally sit idly by and watch as these diseases destroyed their children. %$* 295
but by the 1990s, drugs were developed that could function as replacements for the enzymes that were missing in these related disorders. %$* 295
these disorders were so bad and the drugs were so promising that the first of these medicines, a drug for gaucher’s disease called ceredase, was approved on the basis of a very simple clinical trial that involved only a dozen patients. %$* 295
by 2004, fda had approved enzyme replacements for four other conditions that were each very similar to hunter's syndrome. %$* 295
all were lysosomal storage diseases, where kids were born missing one of these crucial and related enzymes. %$* 295
it was understood that if you could replace the enzyme, these children were likely to derive a therapeutic benefit. %$* 295
but when an experimental enzyme for hunter's syndrome finally came along, a decade after that original drug was approved for gaucher’s disease, fda's regulatory norms and fda's regulatory culture had changed dramatically. %$* 295
in an effort to satisfy an increasingly demanding desire for statistical certainty, the fda trial imposed extraordinary hardships on the children and their families. %$* 295
in order to approve the hunter's drug, called elaprase, fda required that the trial enroll 96 patients. %$* 295
this was fully 20 percent of all the americans afflicted with the disorder. %$* 295
and instead of testing the drug for six months, as had been done for every other drug, all of these enzyme replacements, fda wanted a full year of clinical data, 52 weekly infusions in these kids. %$* 295
fda also insisted that the kids be randomly assigned to receive either a drug or a placebo. %$* 295
there was no need to have a placebo in this clinical trial. %$* 295
the disease follows a very predictable pattern. %$* 295
and doctors already knew the normal decline these kids would have if they were left untreated. %$* 295
but leaving some kids untreated was basically leaving them to become disabled. %$* 295
yet, including the placebo helped give the trial itself more statistical rigor for fda. %$* 295
finally, in past trials, with all these lysosomal storage drugs, these enzyme replacements, drugs targeted to similar diseases, fda asked companies to measure surrogate markers that the-- %$* 295
the drug was having an impact on disease. %$* 295
like the ability to shrink organs, like the liver and the spleen. %$* 295
that was interpreted as proof that the drug was breaking down the sugar molecules and they weren't becoming deposited there. %$* 295
and this would mean that the enzyme replacement was working. %$* 295
by looking at these surrogate measures, which you could measure over a shorter period of time, it was a way to accelerate the development of the drug. %$* 295
but in the case of the hunter's drug, elaprase, fda decided to test the ability of the children to walk and to breathe as the clinical outcome it wanted. %$* 295
fda saw this as a more rigorous way to see if the drug was working, but it came with hard trade-offs. %$* 295
it made the trial much longer than it needed to be. %$* 295
you had to wait years for the kids to become disabled to see if the drug was having its impact and to measure the result. %$* 295
and it tested the boundaries of what was ethical. %$* 295
yet, this story is increasingly the norm when it comes to fda review culture and it's played out multiple times in recent years, so much so that observers who follow the fda now believe that the europeans have become more flexible when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs than the americans. %$* 295
the drug for bone cancer, the drug pirfenidone for ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the drug tafamidis for familial amyloidosis, all rejected by fda in recent years because the statistical results didn't meet the agency's requirements, all approved in europe, all embraced by european regulators. %$* 295
to understand why fda's caution is, at times, hazardous, you have to recognize fda's growing resolve to make sure the trials supporting drug approval meet an arduous but increasingly outdated standard for proving efficacy. %$* 295
as my debate partner, peter huber will show, this outdated model that fda uses exacerbates these problems by making trials much more inefficient than they should be and allowing us to learn far less from the results than we otherwise can. %$* 295
yet surveys of people with life-threatening disorders continue to show that patients want access to promising drugs sooner. %$* 295
they're willing to tolerate some risk. %$* 295
they're willing to tolerate the uncertainty. %$* 295
for patients with unmet medical needs, what kind of fda do we want; an fda that advances care, an fda that gets new science to the patient more quickly? %$* 295
what we can't have is an fda that's ruled by statistics over medicine. %$* 295
we can't have an fda that focuses on its process rather than advancing patient care. %$* 295
americans deserve a less cautious fda and an fda that actively embraces advances in science. %$* 295
thank you. %$* 295
thank you, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
our motion is “the fda's caution is hazardous to our health.” our next debater is going to speak against this motion. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jerry avorn is a professor of medicine at harvard medical school and chief of the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at brigham and women's hospital. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jerry avorn. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 296
it is certainly the case that fda, like any big organization, will occasionally not get things right. %$* 296
and i don't know the rare disease that dr. %$* 296
gottlieb mentioned, but i think we can all agree that in this very difficult balancing act of, “is this drug going to help patients, is it going to perhaps make them sicker? %$* 296
” it is not an easy call. %$* 296
but i think the most important aspect of the question before us is, in general, do we want to have an fda that is thinking very hard about risks and benefits and is requiring that the manufacturers who bring drugs to the fda demonstrate that, in sum, the drug is going to be better for patients and not run the risk that we have all seen in recent years of a vioxx or an avandia that actually caused heart attacks and strokes because those problems were not detected. %$* 296
now, there are a number of myths that underlie the proposition that i think it's important to just dismiss early on. %$* 296
one is that somehow fda is the reason that we don't have more new drugs and that fda is slower than other regulatory agencies. %$* 296
and in fact, these are questions that one can look at with real data. %$* 296
and the real data do not bear out the assertion that dr. %$* 296
gottlieb is defending. %$* 296
there is a very high acceptance rate by fda of new drugs. %$* 296
in an article in forbes from last december, it documented that 77 percent of drugs are approved the first time around, and a very high proportion of the ones where fda says, “please go back and find some more information out for us,” are then approved the second time around. %$* 296
in 2012, the fda approved 39 new drugs, which was way higher than it has approved in any number of years for the last 16.it was a 16-year high. %$* 296
so fda is indeed saying yes to drugs, and it is doing so at a rapid clip. %$* 296
that's the other myth that we need to disabuse ourselves of. %$* 296
in fact, the salaries of the fda staff that review drugs are, for better or worse, half paid by the drug industry, which creates with it some deadlines that, as a result of the so-called user fees, the fda must have its deadlines met. %$* 296
and for a priority drug, which is an important new drug that brings something to the table that we don't already have, that is needed by patients, that deadline is six months. %$* 296
and in the last year, 33 out of the 35 drugs that were brought to fda met their standard, whether it was six months for a priority review or ten months for a standard review. %$* 296
you need a lot of time to be able to look at all of the adverse effects that happen, what is the degree of benefit. %$* 296
and again, i'm sure that there are instances where it could have been done better. %$* 296
and there certainly are ways that, as was mentioned in the early presentation by mr. %$* 296
rosenkranz, where we would like to be bring in genetics and bring in new molecular theories to approve drugs. %$* 296
and that's great, and fda is trying very hard to move in that direction. %$* 296
but in fact, fda is saying yes most of the time. %$* 296
it is approving drugs quickly, as per its requirements. %$* 296
and in a paper last year in the "new england journal of medicine" by dr. %$* 296
ross and colleagues from yale, reasonable university, reasonable journal, they look at whether or not the fda was in fact slower than other regulatory agencies. %$* 296
and so they looked at the european medicines agency, which is the pan-european fda equivalent, and health canada which is the canadian version of fda.and it found that, in fact, review times in the u.s.were shorter for fda than they were for the europeans and for the canadians. %$* 296
and in fact for drugs that were approved in both places, 64 percent of the time they were approved first in the u.s.before in europe, and 86 percent of the time, they were approved in the u.s.before canada. %$* 296
so the myth that somehow fda is slowing things down is not borne out by the facts. %$* 296
the reason we don't have as many new drugs as all of us on this stage and the audience would like to have is because the pharmaceutical industry is not bringing a lot of new drugs to fda to approve. %$* 296
and they can't approve a drug that is not submitted to them. %$* 296
and yet they have this tension because they need to be able to have a drug brought to them, and yet they know, and we know, that manufacturers' enthusiasm, to put it as kindly as we can, about a product that they're trying to market, is perhaps not always going to catch all the down sides. %$* 296
and we've all seen examples of that. %$* 296
so there needs to be an agency that represents the best interests of the american public and can say to the manufacturer, “that does sound promising, but there are some things that you really need to look at, and if it's an important new drug, we'll get you an answer in six months.” i don't think that's too much to expect of a company to do, especially since we know that any drug that is powerful enough to make a difference in patients' lives is also powerful enough to do something that we don't want it to do and didn't expect it to do. %$* 296
and one cannot know that because of enthusiasm or because of medical need. %$* 296
there does need to be a cautious agency out there looking at drugs. %$* 296
and dr. %$* 296
challoner later will talk about devices, which is the other piece of fda's responsibility besides food, which we're not going to get into. %$* 296
and we need to have something interposed between an enthusiastic company, which has billions of dollars riding on the success of its product, and the public health of the american people. %$* 296
and there needs to be a rigorous review. %$* 296
that rigorous review can be done quickly, it can-- %$* 296
and it is being done quickly. %$* 296
it is generally favorable. %$* 296
and just because we can make it better by informing it with genetic and other kinds of biological discoveries doesn't mean that we don't still need to have a traffic cop, kind of like an air traffic controller. %$* 296
we all saw a couple of weeks ago what happens when we have big government back away from having enough air traffic controllers. %$* 296
the fda is the air traffic controller for our drugs, and that is why we need their caution. %$* 296
it is not the case that it's causing public health problems. %$* 296
in fact, they have gotten faster and faster over the past decade. %$* 296
and as a result, they are proving that they can help the american people be protected from drugs that have bad effects. %$* 296
and that's exactly what we need them to do. %$* 296
and that's why i think that it is important to vote against the proposition that fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 296
thank you. %$* 296
thank you, jerry avorn. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
you've heard the first two opening statements, and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating for this motion that the fda's caution is hazardous to our health, i want to introduce peter huber, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and author of the forthcoming book, "the cure in the code: how 20th century law is undermining 21st century medicine." ladies and gentlemen, peter huber. %$* 13
well, in case you didn't know, our side actually won the first round of this debate in 19-- %$* 101
no, in 1992, when we persuaded the fda to adopt what is called the accelerated approval rule. %$* 101
now, i must confess that the rule has been applied not very widely, but in two particular areas and not with whole-hearted enthusiasm, especially of late. %$* 101
but i intend to persuade you that this rule is, in fact, the only place that fda today for we are actually making use of the very best, modern pharmacological science that we have. %$* 101
it is in fact the protocols that the fda uses much more often, the un-accelerated approval, if you will, where we are actively obstructing the use of those technologies and is, therefore, in the standard protocols that the fda has been using for a very long time that the fda is actually hazardous to your health. %$* 101
let me begin by giving you some brief context and a description of where this rule has been applied. %$* 101
go back to 1988, a couple of biochemists from the united states and one british win a nobel prize for their mastering of what is called a structure-based design. %$* 101
and this is one of the two processes that they've been using ever since to design, precisely, targeted drugs that can hone in on a molecule that is associated with some disease. %$* 101
this is some years after hiv arrived in town. %$* 101
and they quickly developed several drugs that can target different parts of hiv's chemistry, which, until very close to that time, had been completely incurable. %$* 101
the fda licenses these drugs at absolutely record speed, applying its accelerated approval rule. %$* 101
and it soon becomes apparent that not one of them is going to be any good; not for long, not on its own. %$* 101
because the virus mutates so fast that you throw any single drug at it and it very quickly develops a resistance to it. %$* 101
you just can't beat it with one drug. %$* 101
but doctors at this point, because the drug's been licensed, are now free to work things out on their own. %$* 101
and they very quickly began assembling these drugs in cocktails and that does the trick. %$* 101
the other-- %$* 101
the second area where the rule has actually been applied quite aggressively for the last 20 years, is oncology. %$* 101
and it's-- %$* 101
here's a brief picture of the kind of medicine that has emerged in that area. %$* 101
there are at least 10 biochemically distinct breast cancers out there. %$* 101
it's not one disease. %$* 101
we treat some of them with estrogen blockers. %$* 101
we treat others with estrogen itself. %$* 101
okay. %$* 101
one of the estrogen blockers performs well only if you have the right liver. %$* 101
it depends-- %$* 101
it has to be metabolized by your liver. %$* 101
you know, some patients have the right liver, others don't. %$* 101
there are at least two other major receptors and two classes of drugs in breast cancers. %$* 101
and you mix them all up in various ways to try and beat the disease in the individual patient. %$* 101
we're finding similar levels of complexity and diversity in almost all of the major intractable diseases we're facing now: the neurological, the autoimmune diseases, and indeed, in many very common diseases like diabetes; they just aren't going to be beaten with one size fits all drugs. %$* 101
the underlying chemistry isn't going to allow it, which is bad news for the fda, because the fda's standard protocols are actually pretty good at getting licensing one size fits all drugs. %$* 101
but they are worse than useless, it turns out, when they encounter complexity. %$* 101
using accelerated approval, the fda can, in fact, handle complexity reasonably well. %$* 101
and it's going to do it even better. %$* 101
in your book, dr.-- %$* 101
i'd surmise you'd not like this rule at all. %$* 101
you attribute its origins to aids activists who terrified the agency with a massive sit-in. %$* 101
here's another view. %$* 101
the rule has allowed for the development of pioneering and lifesaving hiv and cancer drugs over the past two decades. %$* 101
that quote’s from president obama's council of scientific advisers in a report issued last september; and the report recommends that the fda use accelerated approval much more systematically and broadly for all drugs that address an unmet need in treating a serious illness. %$* 101
notice-- %$* 101
this is why we have one lawyer for three doctors. %$* 101
notice that the report did not endorse accelerated approval because it got drugs to patients sooner. %$* 101
it said that the rule allowed for the development of those pioneering drugs. %$* 101
but for the rule, we probably wouldn't have many of those drugs at all, which means that the benefits of that rule have absolutely dwarfed anything that our opponents here can possibly tell you about the rare side effects that might have been missed when that rule was applied. %$* 101
hiv has killed an average of about 20,000 americans a year in the 30 years since it's surfaced in the united states. %$* 101
the numbers would have been horrendously worse if for the last 20 years we didn't have some good treatments for the disease in the place. %$* 101
we owe 40 cancer drugs and 15 new treatments to accelerated approval. %$* 101
they have given years of additional life to many patients. %$* 101
there is no story about safety and side effects that can possibly approach those numbers. %$* 101
so this magic rule doesn't just get us the drugs we need licensed faster. %$* 101
it gets them licensed when the other-- %$* 101
the fda's other rules, the slow rules, just won't license them at all. %$* 101
how? %$* 101
in brief, it-- %$* 101
what it does is it loosens the fda's grip on-- %$* 101
throttling grip on the process just enough to let doctors get involved and work out the really good drug science using the very best tools available. %$* 101
i want to briefly take the time to tell you how this is working, because, you know, it's not really that complicated and you can make your own judgments about how whether it makes sense. %$* 101
first of all, ordinarily, the fda won't license a drug until it sees clinical symptoms. %$* 101
accelerated approval will let you license a drug based on, say, its ability to lower hiv loads in the patients' blood. %$* 101
and by the way, it works in only one in 10 patients. %$* 101
the fda can still license it. %$* 101
it'll make an ad hoc: “oh, gee, that looks promising. %$* 101
we want it.” okay? %$* 101
under accelerated approval, therefore, the drug gets licensed much sooner. %$* 101
but it also gets licensed on a very different kind of evidence. %$* 101
the white house report makes clear that this is exactly what we should do. %$* 101
we should start with the premise that when we have a new drug, it may well be only one piece of a solution that's giving only partial benefits to a minority of patients involved in the-- %$* 101
you're sort of enlisted in the drug trial. %$* 101
the fda standard protocols allow nothing of the sort. %$* 101
under the current application of the rule, the fda, again, in a very ad hoc way, says the drug company-- %$* 101
says to the drug company implicitly and doctors explicitly, “look, work out the stuff-- %$* 101
the rest, you know, once you got the drug out there,” as they did with hiv.the white house report would systematize it. %$* 101
you know, you would gather torrents of information during the trials. %$* 101
and you would-- %$* 101
and you would use those to work out a drug-- %$* 101
molecular information. %$* 101
you'd use those to work out how the patients are doing and why some are faring well on the drug and others aren't. %$* 101
that kind of screening of patients and active rearranging the trial as it progresses is anathema under the standard fda protocols. %$* 101
you're not allowed to do it at all. %$* 101
when you do it, you actually get to precision molecular medicine. %$* 101
you work out how a drug can be precisely prescribed to patients and used just right. %$* 101
the fda is frozen in the headlights. %$* 101
it can't deal with these torrents. %$* 101
it has no experience with them. %$* 101
you need big computers to do it. %$* 101
it is hazardous to your health because it can't use the science. %$* 101
thank you. %$* 101
thank you, peter huber. %$* 13
you know, i think you could actually do one of those fda commercial things, where you read the-- %$* 13
where you read the side effects really fast. %$* 13
that was really well-- %$* 13
that was pretty quick paced. %$* 13
well done. %$* 13
our final debater against this motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health, is david challoner. %$* 13
he is vice president emeritus for health affairs at the university of florida. %$* 13
he chaired the institute of medicine's committee on the public health effectiveness of the fda 510(k) clearance process. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david challoner. %$* 13
thank you, john, and members of the audience. %$* 297
i will be speaking, as was said, against the motion that the fda's caution is hazardous to your health, in particular, as it relates to the device side of the equation. %$* 297
the fda is a public health agency. %$* 297
it is responsible for the safety and efficacy of the devices that are used by you, on you, and put in you. %$* 297
if anything, the anecdotes of the last decade would indicate that we need more caution in our systems. %$* 297
the evidence-- %$* 297
i think this will reverberate with most of you. %$* 297
the shiley heart valve, implanted in patients, many patients, begins after several years shattering and embolizing to your brain and to your peripheral body and killing some patients before they could be replaced. %$* 297
the dalkon shield iud: put in women, causing perforation of the uterus, pelvic infections, some deaths, much trauma. %$* 297
chemotherapy infusion pumps, which were poorly calibrated so that the operators could make mistakes and would infuse drugs, toxic drugs, at ten times the rate that they should have because the wrong button was pushed, killing patients. %$* 297
surgical mesh, vaginal mess. %$* 297
you've all seen these ads from the legal firms, i'm sure, soliciting your business. %$* 297
this was a surgical mesh that was used for hernia surgery and then was transformed to be used and promoted to be used in pelvic surgery for women with disastrous infection, and prolapse, and a variety of other results. %$* 297
radiotherapy machines-- %$* 297
a liner accelerator. %$* 297
again, without maximum controls, 10 to 20 times the dose is given to a patient for a pulmonary tumor and drills a hole through them. %$* 297
pacemaker leads: put into you to manage your cardiac rhythm. %$* 297
and then after two or three years, widely distributed, many people not knowing they have them, breaking, and arrhythmias and other cardiac rhythm disasters were occurring. %$* 297
metal on metal artificial hips. %$* 297
none of you could have missed that. %$* 297
removed poorly, monitored in this country, used widely. %$* 297
now, giving medical-- %$* 297
a metal embolism into patients and causing resurgeries and removals. %$* 297
biliary stents that were approved for use in a very low pressure environment began to be used widely, and promoted widely by industry, for use in veins and arteries elsewhere in the body, in which they collapsed or did not work. %$* 297
so i'd say, with this kind of evidence, that the case is almost closed, and we could vote now. %$* 297
but i think the audience needs to understand exactly how we got to the point we're in. %$* 297
what is the process that has produced these problematic results? %$* 297
well, the vast majority of medical devices used in healthcare in the united states are reviewed by the fda before entering the marketplace, and are cleared. %$* 297
that's a very important word. %$* 297
they are not approved for human use in a process called premarket notification, or the 510 clearance process, which is named after the section of the authorizing legislation in 1976.and the fda has to comply with this because it's legislated that they do so. %$* 297
and this was done 35 years ago in the face of rapidly evolving technologies. %$* 297
then, stimulated by reports of problems, the public, legislators, the general accounting office, the dhhs inspector general and the courts, including the supreme court of the united states, have all questioned the value and logic of this clearance process which is being used by a federal agency charged with protecting and promoting the public's health. %$* 297
what are the major elements of this process? %$* 297
well, premarket, before a device goes out and is sold to you or your doctor or your hospital, for no-risk devices such as tongue depressors or manual wheelchairs, for instance, there are about two-thirds of those that are considered by the fda and go to market directly and are considered basically of no- or low-risk. %$* 297
the high-risk devices comprise about 1 percent of what the fda device regulatory folks must deal with. %$* 297
and they do have to have costly and time-consuming premarket trials before approval. %$* 297
there's some question whether, in the device case, they are as powerful as those which already exist for drugs. %$* 297
the moderate risk 510(k) is the large middle ground. %$* 297
that's about 4,000 applications a year, and it's about a $3 billion a year industry, a very significant business. %$* 297
the 510(k) process was put in place by congress and is not intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of devices. %$* 297
it cannot be transformed into a premarket evaluation of safety and effectiveness as long as the standard for clearance is substantial equivalence to a previously cleared device perhaps as early as 1976 or prior. %$* 297
so these are called predicates. %$* 297
and there's no assurance that a predicate is safe and effective. %$* 297
there's no practical way to remove these undesirable predicates, and you therefore have a daisy chain of approval requirements in the process. %$* 297
thank you, david challoner. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
now we move on to round 2.and round 2 is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from myself and from you in the audience. %$* 13
again, stating the motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
and as we begin round 2, we have heard from scott gottlieb and peter huber arguing for this motion. %$* 13
they're arguing basically, as scott gottlieb put it, that statistics are taking precedence over medicine at the fda, that they're falling into the trap of statistical certainty, needing a level of certainty that is just out of control to the point where it's slowing down process, discouraging innovation, and therefore denying access to devices and products, pharmaceutical products that could actually save lives. %$* 13
they point out that europe is approving drugs that the fda is actually denying. %$* 13
and they say that the fact that some drugs actually get a special fast track suggests that there's something wrong with the slow track. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, david challoner and jerry avorn. %$* 13
vioxx. %$* 13
they point out the case of vioxx and other instance-- %$* 13
instances of pharmaceuticals that made it to the market and killed hundreds of people. %$* 13
they've talked about devices that have poisoned and lacerated the insides of women. %$* 13
they also deny the argument that the fda is slow to approve. %$* 13
they point out that 70 percent of pharmaceuticals are approved the first time around, and if anything, they say, what’s needed in the fda is not less caution, but more of it. %$* 13
the question i want to put to this side-- %$* 13
it's not really a debate point. %$* 13
i'm looking for some clarification, and i just want to see if you will agree to their clarification, because i think we in the audience-- %$* 13
myself and you in the audience, need a little bit of a picture first of what it is we're talking about when we talk about a classic fda drug trial. %$* 13
you've referred to it; i don't see it. %$* 13
so scott gottlieb, if you could take 45 seconds outside of your debate time to tell us what is phase i, phase ii, phase iii? %$* 13
who's involved? %$* 13
how long does it take? %$* 13
what does it cost? %$* 13
and with the understanding that this is that system that you're talking about that-- %$* 13
that you're challenging. %$* 13
right. %$* 295
well, i think that the issue really is development times, not review times, as dr. %$* 295
avorn talked about. %$* 295
he was focusing on review times, how long does it take fda to look at the applications? %$* 295

he decided to bring porn to the district office, the rubber room. %$* 407
he got caught. %$* 407
with the union lawyers’ help, he got put back into a school, another school, the third school now. %$* 407
and in short order, he got caught showing his female students some of his pornography collection. %$* 407
the last i heard he's back in a district office waiting for his union lawyer to make the next move. %$* 407
this is the kind of guy that really needs the union. %$* 407
not a dedicated teacher. %$* 407
not an honest teacher here. %$* 407
this is the kind of guy who really needs the union. %$* 407
by the way, the guy i'm talking about, mr. %$* 407
x.is really a pussy cat compared to some of the teachers you have in new york. %$* 407
just reading some things about a-- %$* 407
i'm only saying his name because it's in the newspapers, francisco olivares, who impregnated one of his students and his still on the payroll. %$* 407
another instance of my middle school involved a teacher who decided to sunbathe topless on the athletic field at lunch. %$* 407
it was a nice spring day. %$* 407
what happened? %$* 407
with the union's help, she was put back into school in an elementary school this time. %$* 407
once again, a union rep in his own words, “i've gone in and defended teachers who shouldn't even be pumping gas.” not my quote. %$* 407
this is a union rep. %$* 407
that's the mentality. %$* 407
unions today function more like criminal lawyers than partners in education reform. %$* 407
very importantly, too, the unions love the status quo and will fight to keep it. %$* 407
in california recently, education reformer, bill evers was attacked by a local union for trying to get singapore math a new and innovative way of teaching a subject, but because learning all the different things you had to do to teach this was a little bit too much for some of the teachers, the unions decide to kill it. %$* 407
very importantly, the unions are constantly trying to limit the number of charter schools. %$* 407
“the cartel,” an excellent film by bob bowden, about public education has one of the most affecting scenes i've ever seen on film. %$* 407
it shows parents and children waiting to see if they won the lottery. %$* 407
that is if they got into the charter school. %$* 407
if charter schools have more children than seats available, very simply they'll hold a lottery. %$* 407
and in this scene the camera goes into-- %$* 407
close on the faces of the children and the parents who are winning the lottery and getting to the charter school and they're thrilled and you feel happy for them. %$* 407
and then they go into the people who didn't win, and these people are crying and sad and you feel horrible for them: very affecting scene. %$* 407
but these tears of joy and anger-- %$* 407
tears of joy and sadness turn to anger because you realize the unions are constantly fighting the establishment of charter schools as the utla did just about two weeks ago in los angeles. %$* 407
they were very successful at killing charter schools. %$* 407
another abominable example, i'm going to speak a little quickly because i'm running out of time. %$* 407
the dc opportunity scholarship program, it was created to rescue at least some children from the horrible school district, washington d.c.we spent $27,000 per student. %$* 407
probably the worst school system in the country. %$* 407
1,700 kids, mostly poor, mostly black, won the lottery which gave them a $7,500 scholarship to get into the best schools they could, private or parochial. %$* 407
the program was a great success. %$* 407
the kids looked forward to going to school for the first time. %$* 407
they thrived. %$* 407
the parents were happy. %$* 407
the taxpayers saved money. %$* 407
the only ones not happy were the unions who cannot abide any competition for the government run monopolies, even though it has been shown that when school choice exists, public schools improve. %$* 407
i will close with a quote from ron williams who said about this situation, “the nea seems far more devoted to its members than they are of the children they teach. %$* 407
it doesn't seem to bother them that they continue to fail the nation's most vulnerable children.” amen to that, mr. %$* 407
williams. %$* 407
thank you. %$* 407
thank you, larry sand. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared debate. %$* 13
we now have the results of our initial vote where we asked you, the live audience, to tell us where you stand on the motion. %$* 13
our motion is don't blame teacher's union for our failing schools. %$* 13
before the debate, the vote went like this. %$* 13
those for the motion, those who say it's not the teacher's fault: 24%.those who blame teacher's unions for our failing schools, against the motion: 43%.and we have 33% undecided. %$* 13
we'll ask you to vote once again at the end of the debate, and the team that changes the most minds during the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, on to round two. %$* 13
this is our middle round in which the debaters talk directly to one another, and take questions from me and also from you in the audience. %$* 13
and i want to begin with a couple of specifics-- %$* 13
specific charges that were laid out there without responded to. %$* 13
terry moe specifically saying that teachers unions operate against the whole notion of charter schools, that they try to stop them wherever they find them. %$* 13
i want to hear from the other side, true or not true. %$* 13
let’s start with randi weingarten. %$* 13
well, given that the united federation of teachers under my watch, started two charter schools in eastern york, it’s totally and completely untrue. %$* 402
what we want to do is we want charters to be held to the same accountability standards including the ones that we started, as any other school and what the evidence has been in new york, like the evidence around the country, is that charter schools instead of, as diane ravitch said, should take more of the most at-risk kids are actually taking fewer special needs kids and fewer kids with limited english proficiency. %$* 402
so we’ve open to, we think charters could be a great incubator for instructional practice and could be a great incubator for labor relations practice. %$* 402
but terry, i don’t want new york to be as much as an evidentiary zone as washington d.c.seems to be, which means let’s look at the credo story which were done with a pro-charter advocate. %$* 402
what they said was, where 17 percent of the charters are better than public schools, 34 percent are worse, and the rest are the same. %$* 402
the idea is to actually find what works, make it sustainable and make it replicable. %$* 402
that’s what we’re trying to do and that’s what i’m trying to do. %$* 402
terry moe, randi weingarten is saying no, it’s not true that they are against all charter schools. %$* 13
well let me first point out that new york state has a cap on the number of charter schools. %$* 403
it has a cap because this union put it there. %$* 403
and even under the pressure of race to the top, they wouldn’t lift the cap. %$* 403
right, so this is not an organization that’s in favor of charter schools. %$* 403
they’ve done everything they can to keep charter schools down. %$* 403
what they’re doing now in new york city is they’re running three charter schools to show if they can, that unionized charter schools can work, because what they want to do, is to unionize all the charter schools. %$* 403
that’s the only reason they’re doing it. %$* 403
randi. %$* 13
i mean, what’s interesting terry is that i didn’t know you were in my head so much. %$* 402
we are not running charter schools to unionize all charter schools. %$* 402
where’d the cap come from? %$* 403
what we wanted to do, what we wanted to do was actually the new york city and state union were in favor of lifting the cap and in favor of creating a level playing field to make sure that all kids could equally get into all schools. %$* 402
and if you recall, new york state became one of the finalists for race to the top so obviously whatever happened in the state legislature didn’t disqualify us from race to the top. %$* 402
the bottom line is, we need schools-- %$* 402
all schools: charter, public, private to be places where parents want to send their kids and where educators want to work. %$* 402
that’s the bottom line. %$* 402
how do we help all kids, not just some kids, but all kids. %$* 402
do you want to respond because i want to move on to another question, but if you’d like to respond. %$* 13
i’ll just make one point. %$* 403
i mean, this is the standard response that it’s really all about kids? %$* 403
but the fact of the matter is, they’re trying to keep the number of charter schools down. %$* 403
they’re responsible for this cap in new york state and everything else is just a rationalization. %$* 403
terry, i wish we had the kind of-- %$* 402
randi, i’m going to go on. %$* 13
kate mclaughlin, who is arguing. %$* 13
charter schools in l.a. %$* 406
gary smuts, i’m going to let you go. %$* 13
gary smuts, i just want to get to the-- %$* 13
charter schools in l.a.and there’s magnet schools in l.a.“l.a.times” article about two months ago by howard bloom pointed out that the most successful schools in the l.a.unified school district are magnet schools. %$* 406
now these aren’t schools that shut down, get rid of kids, get rid of teachers; these are schools that have a special focus, that keep their faculty. %$* 406
if you want the most successful schools in the l.a.area, it’s not charters. %$* 406
it’s not traditional schools. %$* 406
it’s magnet schools that have the same configuration, the same union. %$* 406
if you want success, go with magnets. %$* 406
don’t go with charters, and don’t even go with traditional schools. %$* 406
one more response from this side. %$* 13
are these magnet schools, schools of choice? %$* 405
most of the magnet-- %$* 406
all of the magnet schools, %$* 406
i’ll answer this in my district. %$* 406
i have 10 magnet schools in my district. %$* 406
students can-- %$* 406
no student leaves those schools, no teachers leave those school. %$* 406
we invite other students substantially though, better than 95 percent of the students are the same students that have always been there. %$* 406
and those schools are successful. %$* 406
larry sand. %$* 13
yeah, just here in new york city, in harlem, we have very successful charter schools like kipp, democracy prep, and harlem success. %$* 407
the parents, as far as i know, there aren't enough to keep up with the demand, yet randi is saying that-- %$* 407
seems to have a problem with charters. %$* 407
so she wants to go very slowly. %$* 407
it seems that the parents want these things because most of their kids are in hell holes. %$* 407
now, this is not the-- %$* 407
this is not the union's fault that they're in hell holes necessarily, but it's the union's fault because they keep them in hell holes. %$* 407
the best from a local standpoint-- %$* 404
in lowell, massachusetts, it's quite the opposite. %$* 404
they are actually closing the-- %$* 404
they actually force-- %$* 404
they wanted to close the charter school. %$* 404
and we actually appealed on their behalf, so they have to cut the school in half and stop teaching middle schoolers, and we will absorb those students back in the local-- %$* 404
you're saying that the union stood up for the charter school? %$* 407
and the-- %$* 404
the school system. %$* 404
but what you don't know-- %$* 404
again, you say, oh, teachers are against charter schools. %$* 404
you're making up the story why-- %$* 404
i am. %$* 404
let me tell you why i am. %$* 404
they-- %$* 407
actually, they're not saying that. %$* 407
they are saying teachers unions use political power-- %$* 407
use political power to stop the proliferation of-- %$* 407
no, listen to-- %$* 404
with a teacher's-- %$* 405
from a-- %$* 404
with a teacher union. %$* 405
rod paige, i want to let kate finish. %$* 13
from a local standpoint, we-- %$* 404
from this charter school that was going to be announced-- %$* 404
got students back from this charter school which we welcomed. %$* 404
we don't get the funding for them for another year. %$* 404
so when the teachers unions bring up this issue, we're somehow against charter schools. %$* 404
there are major issues about the funding that comes with it. %$* 404
but when we speak it up, we're somehow obstructionist. %$* 404
that is not the case. %$* 404
the other issue about charter schools for me and for my type offers union is it's an equity issue. %$* 404
and my teachers union president has gone even to the governor and suggested that if charter schools are truly innovative, they should be a draft and not a cream of the crop selection. %$* 404
they are not the cream of the crop-- %$* 407
and that-- %$* 404
and it is a total equity issue because we've all agreed that achievement gaps come from school-based issues. %$* 404
they come from social issues, and they come from economic issues. %$* 404
and if you alone base a lottery on which parents have gone to sign up, you have already changed some of those issues. %$* 404
so it is an equity issue. %$* 404
to the other side, larry sand. %$* 13
go see bob bowden’s film. %$* 407
you tell me those parents and those kids are the cream. %$* 407
these are poor people. %$* 407
maybe they're the cream of the poor people. %$* 407
i don't know. %$* 407
let's bring this back to the issue of unions. %$* 13
and i want to go to the side that is arguing that teachers unions are to be blamed for the failure of the schools. %$* 13
and the other side, your opponents are arguing-- %$* 13
two of your opponents used in their arguments the point that there is no real correlation between states that have strong teachers unions and poor academic achievement. %$* 13
kate mclaughlin, your opponent said there is absolutely no research on that. %$* 13
and randi weingarten pointed to the numbers of states where actually there were strong unions and strong school results. %$* 13
i'd like one of you to respond to that. %$* 13
i'd be happy to respond, but i don't know where this stuff comes from, really. %$* 403
look, many, many, many, many factors influence student achievement. %$* 403
and to say basically that schools in the south don't do as well as schools in the north, which is true, and that schools in the south don't have unions and the schools in the north do, and to say, gee whiz, it must be because unions are good for schools. %$* 403
i-- %$* 403
don't try that at a university. %$* 403
it doesn't wash. %$* 403
so, look, as far as the research goes, i don't know where kate's getting this. %$* 403
i mean, there is a research literature. %$* 403
actually, it's pretty big on the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement. %$* 403
she says there's nothing. %$* 403
there is, plenty. %$* 403
it started sort of back in the 1980s. %$* 403
most of the literature i think is not good. %$* 403
but that's typical of most of social science. %$* 403
a lot of this stuff is bad. %$* 403
and part of the reason is that things are complicated. %$* 403
it's very hard to do good studies. %$* 403
so you can't just like count up studies. %$* 403
the results in this literature are pretty mixed. %$* 403
and i think it's partly because, a, it's complicated, and b, a lot of the studies don't do it very well. %$* 403
but there are two studies that are actually in very top-level journals, they have been through very rigorous peer review process. %$* 403
they are one by caroline hoxby in the “quarterly journal of economics,” 1996. another one is by me in-- %$* 403
but that one's really good. %$* 13
yeah, this-- %$* 403
it's a lot better than caroline's. %$* 403
and it is in the “american journal of political science,” 2009. both these studies show, through a quantitative analysis, both of them very extensive, that the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement is negative. %$* 403
okay. %$* 13
randi weingarten, teachers union president. %$* 13
so, terry, you've actually just made the point that i think many of us are trying to make on this side, which is it is complicated. %$* 402
there is not one factor that either causes student success or-- %$* 402
or is an obstacle to it. %$* 402
and that's exactly what we are trying to say. %$* 402
so ultimately, just like we did not say that teacher unions were the reason why maryland or massachusetts or new york were so successful-- %$* 402
and by the way, that was just in quality counts from education week. %$* 402
we were not the ones that said that finland or japan were most successful. %$* 402
we're just saying that those are the correlations. %$* 402
now, there is one person who used to actually agree with you hugely diane ravitch who, in looking at much of the evidence over the course of time, whether it was on charters or whether it was on vouchers has thrill just written a book saying slow down. %$* 402
the evidence of these kinds of market strategies just doesn't work. %$* 402
my point is this: whether you look at-- %$* 402
everyone is going to find anecdotes to fit into their case. %$* 402
that's not going to help one more child learn. %$* 402
we are searching for what actually works. %$* 402
so regardless of the quotes when they hurl at me from the nea or from other places, i stand by the record that we have in turning around schools in new york city. %$* 402
mr. %$* 402
rudy crew, who is sitting there, and i, together did probably the most important reform strategy in new york in the late 1990s, early 2000, where we actually turned around schools in harlem. %$* 402
we turned around schools in new york city. %$* 402
we want to make sure every single child has a choice. %$* 402
once they have a choice for a charter, so be it. %$* 402
but every child should have a choice for a neighborhood high school or a neighborhood school. %$* 402
and larry, last point to you, which is this: just recently, unlike what you said about la, in la, there were 36 schools that were put up for grabs by the la school board. %$* 402
the charters love this. %$* 402
they wanted this competition. %$* 402
and in that competition, regular school teachers, supported by their union, won 29 of the 36 schools because of their plans. %$* 402
the bottom line is we need to do the things that gary and kate talked about in terms of helping all kids, well prepared and supported teachers, real engaged curriculum, safe and orderly environments which is what we see in charter schools all the time, good, good management that works together. %$* 402
and at the end of the day, if we have to find ways, as i said in 2004, to police our own profession, fire teachers that are not making the grade, we want to do that. %$* 402
that's who this teachers union is. %$* 402
okay, i want-- %$* 13
we want the best and the brightest for all of our young people in this country. %$* 402
all right, randi, i gave you quite a long run with that. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 402
and i want-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 402
that's all right, but i do want to urge us to stay as close as possible to our motions. %$* 13
and i think all of us probably share a sense that we want things to improve. %$* 13
but i want to discourage too much grand-standing on the point because we really want to get to the issue at hand. %$* 13
i want to go to the audience. %$* 13
that's not to say that any of us disagree with that. %$* 13
just the nature of the debate. %$* 13
i want to go to the audience for questions now. %$* 13
and what we will do is have microphones circulate in the aisles. %$* 13
and if you raise your hands and identify you, please stand, and i'll bring a microphone to you. %$* 13
hold it about a fist's distance away from your mouth so that the radio audience can hear you. %$* 13
and i want to urge to you actually ask questions and to try to move this debate along in the area in which we are talking and not to make grand-standing speeches or to debate the debaters. %$* 13
they are here to debate each other, i hope prompted by you. %$* 13
and there's a gentleman, a person with eyeglasses there getting the microphone now. %$* 13
if you could just rise, sir, and identify yourself. %$* 13
well, i make two-- %$* 31
two sentences. %$* 31
i would rather that you just make one statement and go to a question. %$* 13
yes, okay. %$* 31
you don't have problem with having a good car. %$* 31
you know which cars are good and you can choose. %$* 31
you know this debate there was parents who have basically forgotten and the question is, in the last two, three decades, have teachers unions helped parents to know which teachers are good and which teachers are bad, and second, have they helped parents during the last two, three decades, not last two, three years, helped parents to be able to choose good teachers? %$* 31
all right, i'm going to take this-- %$* 13
thank you, sir, we get the point, and we need to move on. %$* 13
so i think the question probably, both sides can respond, but probably is primarily directed to this side. %$* 13
and i also think it's a rephrasing of the question or a statement that's been put forward by your opponents who argue that the interests of teachers' unions are not the interests of the children, and none of you have actually addressed that particular point directly, that point being, as has been stated, that teachers' unions are there to grow their numbers, to protect their salaries, to protect seniority. %$* 13
and in terms of those specifics, if you can connect that to the gentleman's question, is it good for our kids and is it good for the parents in knowing what teachers are good and what teachers are bad. %$* 13
i taught for 14 years-- %$* 406
gary smuts. %$* 13
and never did i grade a test or work with my class thinking that-- %$* 406
about my standing in the teachers' union. %$* 406
that doesn't even go through your mind. %$* 406
i would agree that teachers unions don't rank teachers, but neither do administrators. %$* 406
there's no ranking of teachers in any school by anybody. %$* 406
i don't even know if it's possible. %$* 406
i don't even know if it's desirable. %$* 406
it wouldn't be something i would recommend that management do or teachers unions do. %$* 406
i don't think it can be done. %$* 406
i don't think it necessarily should be done. %$* 406
there are a variety of factors. %$* 406
we've all had teachers that have been enormously successful with some folks and not very successful with others. %$* 406
you can't blame teachers unions for not ranking teachers because nobody ranks teachers like that. %$* 406
and what about the part of the question i brought, too, because this is an itch i need scratched the whole issue that the objectives of a union is not the same thing as the objective of taking care of the kids in the best possible way in the educational system. %$* 13
that's not true in my district. %$* 406
the changed their name from union rep to learning rep. %$* 406
and it's not-- %$* 402
let's hear this out because-- %$* 13
the number one focus of the teachers' union and in the workshop where that was done, what they worked on, were all of the strategies and techniques to produce successful students. %$* 406
the number one job according to my union president of the union reps, the reps in my district, is student achievement. %$* 406
and we work together to do that. %$* 406
it's one of the most powerful forces in our district. %$* 406
i've had great administrators and they work with teachers to produce successful students. %$* 406
why would you want it any other way? %$* 406
fighting each other doesn't work. %$* 406
it's a dumb plan to fight each other and say, "one side's going to win, and one side's going to lose." i don't believe in that. %$* 406
you know you got to work together, and if you don't, it is never going to work. %$* 406
that side said that you never-- %$* 406
secretary paige said, "you're never going to do away with teachers' unions." he doesn't want to do that. %$* 406
if that's the truth, then we'd better start working together or we're going to die together. %$* 406
i think if you look at the-- %$* 402
rather than-- %$* 402
randi, can you hold a minute-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 402
because we've had quite a bit from this side, and i will come back to you. %$* 13
terry moe, i had indicated you could respond to this. %$* 13
terry moe. %$* 13
yeah, i just wanted to say that basically the teachers' unions don't want teacher performance to be measured, and they especially don't want any information to get out about how well teachers do. %$* 403
actually the testing technology is quite sophisticated now. %$* 403
and it's possible, not just to do value added calculations for how much kids learn during a year but also to take into account, through statistical controls, student background characteristics, how much students know at the beginning of the year so that you can control for that, and so on. %$* 403
and so it is certainly possible to do these things in a very systematic and rigorous and fair way. %$* 403
and i think what we're going to be leading toward eventually, unless the teachers' unions are able to block it, is a system where we have information on teacher performance under a variety of conditions and we move towards transparency, where it is possible to let people know what teachers are good and what teachers are not good, because if teachers are not good, people should know that so that they don't put their kids in those classrooms. %$* 403
it's very important. %$* 403
randi weingarten. %$* 13
well, well-- %$* 402
well, let me just bring in randi weingarten, please. %$* 13
well-- %$* 402
there's no-- %$* 405
i'd like to bring in randi weingarten, and then i'll come back to you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 405
i will. %$* 13
so the question is-- %$* 402
the question, i think, john, you keep on asking is, what’s the teacher union job? %$* 402
and if you look at the three of us, and you actually listen to our members, you’re actually right. %$* 402
we are paid to listen to our members because very few other people actually do listen to the voices of teachers. %$* 402
there was a gates study recently that said that of 40,000 teachers, that said that overwhelmingly what they wanted; number one issue is they wanted to be supported; they wanted to be respected. %$* 402
that is very similar to polling that we have taken of our members and very similar to what i see when i was a local union president, where we had the most extraordinary people in new york city teaching in our classrooms. %$* 402
what we see is that members by a four to one and five to one margin have said to us, they want us to fight for the tools and conditions they need to do their jobs. %$* 402
and ultimately, when we try to fight for budgets for schools, when we try to fight for equity; when we try to fight to ensure that class sizes are low and that they’re safe and reasonable environments for kids so that kids don’t get bullied, when in some ways we try to fight for the things that i know the harlem parents have tried to fight for in the schools that they have. %$* 402
that’s the integration between teacher unions and kids. %$* 402
okay, rod page. %$* 13
i’m going to go back to the ranking of teachers. %$* 405
and i’ll admit that i can agree that there’s no formal ranking of teachers. %$* 405
but let me tell you, there is a ranking of teachers, while i served as superintendent of schools in houston, it was very clear to me that the kids know who the best teachers are. %$* 405
they know who the poor teachers are. %$* 405
the other teachers know who the poor teachers are. %$* 405
absolutely; they know who the bad teachers are too, there’s very much clear ranking. %$* 405
and this is not ambiguous at all. %$* 405
the rankings are there; we don’t use in a formal way or to make policy, but they’re ranked. %$* 405
i’d like to go to another question, before i do that, just for radio, i want to say the following. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of the intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams of three debating this motion: don’t blame the teachers’ unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
to another question right in front-- %$* 13
and then i’ll start moving to this side. %$* 13
please rise, thank you. %$* 13
hi my name is alexis moore and i’m a sophomore at princeton university and the vice president of students for education reform. %$* 408
and this week, i’m here with a group of 15 undergraduates who are studying education reform here in new york city. %$* 408
can you get to your question please? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 408
half of us are tutoring at paul robison high school, which is slated for closure and last year robison’s four year graduation was 40 percent. %$* 408
i really need you to get to your question. %$* 13
please get to your question okay. %$* 13
and the ust has come out in opposition to the closure of the school which would open up new options for people in that neighborhood and those students. %$* 408
the question goes to the side for the motion. %$* 408
why come out against the closure of a poor school? %$* 408
thank you. %$* 408
thank you. %$* 13
do you feel you had information or did i suppress too much? %$* 13
i think none of have enough information about the specifics about this. %$* 402
i probably have more than the rest of us. %$* 402
but i don’t-- %$* 402
let me tell you about two other schools that i know about well. %$* 402
meaning, i don’t know about robison but i do know-- %$* 402
let’s move on. %$* 13
with respect to your question and i did push you to cut to the chase; i think there was information and i don’t think the panel’s familiar enough with it so i’m going to move on, but thank you very much. %$* 13
to this side, right down front: if you could stand please. %$* 13
and could you wait for just one second; i want to make sure the camera’s on you. %$* 13
okay, thank you. %$* 13
my name is denise saul and i too am a teacher. %$* 409
i taught in public, in private. %$* 409
i’d like to know how many teachers there are in new york state and how many teachers were fired this year. %$* 409
randi weingarten. %$* 13
how many union people-- %$* 402
teachers union people are in this audience? %$* 402
first answer the first question; i’m going to ponder the second one. %$* 13
i mean i wish i was actually, so-- %$* 402
you want to ask. %$* 402
the problem i have with asking how many unionized teachers are the audience, because i’m not sure how to ask the other side of the question. %$* 13
and we’re open to everybody and if there’s a notion that the audience is packed, that’s not something we can control. %$* 13
so i’d rather not have an identification. %$* 13
let me just say. %$* 402
let me just say there was no attempt on any of our parts to either pack the audience or to give people invitations other than the six or ten that-- %$* 402
invitations that i received. %$* 402
so there's no-- %$* 402
there was no attempt to do any of that. %$* 402
now, having said that-- %$* 402
but there's a suspicion, which is interesting. %$* 13
well-- %$* 402
it's not-- %$* 402
which i think goes to the tone of where the lack of trust is. %$* 13
well, but i think that the tone-- %$* 402
what i have experienced in terms of new york city is that in a-- %$* 402
most teachers right now, as we are speaking, are at home actually grading papers and marking lessons. %$* 402
and frankly, from my perspective when i was the teachers union president here, i never actually asked people to come or pack an audience or do these things, from my perspective. %$* 402
i can't talk for other than myself. %$* 402
in terms of the question about firing, what tends to happen in the teaching ranks is that there is a huge attrition rate of teachers. %$* 402
and so you have essentially half the new teachers within the first five to seven years actually leave the profession because it is such a tough, tough, tough place to work. %$* 402
and whether it's because they don't get the support that they need or a variety of other things, whether it's salaries or other things, what you see is that you use both the statistics of how many people have attrited out. %$* 402
and in new york city last year, my understanding was that about 30 to 40 percent of the teachers, or about 30 percent of the new teachers attrited out within the first five years in terms of firing on what the statistic is. %$* 402
but i will tell you, in terms of the peer intervention process and program that we started in 1987, first under my predecessor, sandy feldman and then myself, we actually counseled hundreds of teachers out of the profession who we thought, after we tried to help them, were not up to snuff. %$* 402
let me come to larry sand. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 407
if you send me an email thursday morning, i will get you an answer to your question. %$* 407
i'll give you an answer to a question, though, that you didn't ask, which is how many teachers got fired in new york state-- %$* 407
excuse me, new york city. %$* 407
and in 2008, it was 10 out of 55,000. does that mean that there are 54,990 competent teachers in new york? %$* 407
actually, it's not-- %$* 402
larry, that's actually not true. %$* 402
there were in 19-- %$* 402
in 2008, the last year i was here, there were over a thousand teachers that were terminated for lots of different reasons. %$* 402
okay, larry, did you want to continue your point? %$* 13
i want to ask you whether that question was a plant or not. %$* 13
i'm joking. %$* 13
do you want to continue your point? %$* 13
i have very different statistics than-- %$* 407
i think you made it. %$* 13
i'd like to go a little farther up-- %$* 13
black t-shirt. %$* 13
can you rise and wait just a second? %$* 13
you're in a little bit of darkness, so it will take the camera a second to adjust. %$* 13
and they found you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
go ahead, sir. %$* 13
first of all, mr. %$* 31
sputs, thanks-- %$* 31
smuts, i'm sorry. %$* 31
thanks for sharing your ideas about the union in your area. %$* 31
i'm thinking of changing my name to handsome genius and see if that works as well for me as it did for you. %$* 31
but my question is for-- %$* 31
for the union representatives here is, you keep making the case that we should be listening to teachers and everyone's thinking about the best interests of the children. %$* 31
but shouldn't we be listening to parents first and not-- %$* 31
absolutely. %$* 402
so why are you standing in the school house door and stopping parents from having the choice of where to send their children to school? %$* 31
kate mclaughlin, could you take that one? %$* 13
well, and again, i firmly admit this. %$* 404
i am a lowell girl, and i don't know everything that goes on in the big wide world. %$* 404
but our public schools in lowell are all choice schools. %$* 404
there are no neighborhood schools. %$* 404
we're a city of a little over a hundred thousand people. %$* 404
we have 23 schools, and parents choose. %$* 404
it used to be based on themes, much like the magnet schools. %$* 404
but unfortunately with the high-stakes testing, the themes have gone to the wayside, and all of the well-meaning grants with mandates attached. %$* 404
so i can't speak to that. %$* 404
but the parents do have the choice. %$* 404
so i actually am a parent of a lowell public school child. %$* 404
and i went to the central office and registered him. %$* 404
i put down my top three choices for schools, very much like what you're all advocating for. %$* 404
and that's our public school system, and that's all something our union supports. %$* 404
my district has-- %$* 406
gary smuts. %$* 13
29 regular k-12, kindergarten, middle-- %$* 406
i mean elementary, middle and high school, one adult school. %$* 406
we're schools of choice. %$* 406
we have one-third of our schools are magnet schools. %$* 406
parents can make choices. %$* 406
every school in our district has a school site council where parents are represented. %$* 406
the school board, parents from the district, it's a very powerful influence in our school district, as it should be. %$* 406
and we-- %$* 406
we have board advisory committees that are made up of all parents in the district that report regularly-- %$* 406
let me ask rod paige, what do you make of what he's just saying now? %$* 13
well, i'm not sure how to-- %$* 405
what to make of that, actually. %$* 405
you're saying that choice is good. %$* 405
yes. %$* 404
yes. %$* 405
i want to hear plenty of that. %$* 405
and we've had choice since i was in elementary school. %$* 404
we all went to public schools. %$* 404
we also believe that public choice is good, and we have never-- %$* 402
i know there's an issue here in terms of what must be going on in new york city right now because obviously feel the heat in this room about that. %$* 402
but ultimately, we believe in far broader choice and that every parent should have a public neighborhood school in which to send his or her kids and then ultimately have the broadest possible choices. %$* 402
new york city has actually the broadest high school choice program of any school district in the nation. %$* 402
terry moe. %$* 13
look, this is all in code. %$* 403
so basically the unions are in favor of choice as long as the schools that kids can choose to move into are unionized. %$* 403
and so they are all in favor-- %$* 403
this is just true. %$* 403
they're all in favor of public school choice. %$* 403
and that means-- %$* 403
what she really means is moving from one regular public school to another regular public school. %$* 403
they're all unionized. %$* 403
they're all under the contract. %$* 403
charter schools are public schools. %$* 403
but the unions have done everything they can to keep the number of charter schools down everywhere. %$* 403
gary smuts, respond to that. %$* 13
well, we don't have any charters in our school district. %$* 406
nobody is-- %$* 406
anybody that's applied, trouble is they hadn't-- %$* 406
the couple that did, didn't adopt the california state curriculum, and that's a requirement in california. %$* 406
there's charter schools that just started, a whole bunch up in los angeles. %$* 406
charters in southern california aren't that particularly-- %$* 406
terry's bottom-line point was that when teachers are talking about charter schools and schools in general, they're all for change and choice but not if the school is not unionized. %$* 13
do you think that that's a fair point? %$* 13
it's a little hard in california because we're teacher union state. %$* 406
so other than catholic schools-- %$* 406
second largest system in the country. %$* 406
i take total exception because my issue as a union leader about charter schools, if they are public schools, and this is my experience as a teacher, and hearing from the other teachers, why is it when a child needs an outside placement that costs over a hundred thousand dollars, the charter school sends them back to the public schools to pay for. %$* 404
if they are a public school, that is their student. %$* 404
they should support him. %$* 404
but, kate, to the point; do you unions only want unionized schools? %$* 13
unions-- %$* 402
no, let me ask kate because she's in-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 402
mid flow here. %$* 13

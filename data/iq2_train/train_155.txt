the team arguing against the motion, the admiral and the general, dennis blair and norton schwartz are arguing that drones are far more accurate than any comparable weapon systems; that they minimize loss of life certainly for u.s. troops, but also for civilians on the ground because of that accuracy; that they're a tool that lets the u.s. military reach the enemy in extremely difficult-to-reach places; and that they have done their job, that they have decimated al-qaeda. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that's arguing against the motion, which means that you do not think the program is flawed, and quote back to you something that one of your opponents, ahmed rashid said, in which he said-- %$* 13
and i'm pretty close to verbatim here. %$* 13
he said that the drones take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-qaeda. %$* 13
and i don't know, ahmed, how literally you meant that. %$* 13
but i want to put the question to this side. %$* 13
in terms of this proportion of civilian casualties to desired targets, what do we know about that? %$* 13
norton schwartz. %$* 13
the best information we have, one of the best sources, is the long war journal. %$* 440
and it's-- %$* 440
it estimates that civilian casualties versus legitimate combatants in the afghan theater is about one to seven; in other words, one civilian casualty to seven legitimate combatant casualties. %$* 440
in yemen, the numbers are somewhat different, about one civilian casualty to five. %$* 440
now, you can question whether long war journal's analysis is accurate. %$* 440
it's consistent with some of the un reporting as well. %$* 440
i would argue again that any loss of life, any civilian loss of life, is not what uniform personal strive for. %$* 440
they strive to avoid that outcome. %$* 440
let me take it over to ahmed rashid. %$* 13
ahmed, i was quoting you as saying that the civilian loss is just as much as the-- %$* 13
the death of al-qaeda targets. %$* 13
i don't know if you meant it 50/50, if that's what your point was. %$* 13
well, we really don't know. %$* 437
i mean, but certainly there's enough evidence in countries like pakistan and afghanistan that civilians have died in considerable numbers. %$* 437
now, that's probably getting less and less as drones become more and more accurate. %$* 437
but as long as things like what i described, the signature strikes continue, where it is justified for a controller to drop a bomb on a group of people in which some of them may be militants and others not, obviously, you are going to get civilian casualties. %$* 437
and as the admiral said this is a war zone. %$* 437
and, in a war zone, you're going to get civilian casualties. %$* 437
the fact of the matter is that this is really undermining and destroying everything else that the u.s. is trying to do in these countries. %$* 437
i want to come a little bit later back to the topic of signature strikes and talk about those more specifically. %$* 13
but just back to dennis blair on this notion of the accuracy of these weapons. %$* 13
your team is arguing that, in fact, because they can hover over an area for so many hours, because-- %$* 13
maybe you're even saying because there's not a pilot with his heart beating and racing and being shot at, that there's a more rational and sober process happening at the pilot end of this, and that that makes them safer and more accurate. %$* 13
is there something-- %$* 13
i'm trying to get at, is there something in the nature of the weapon itself that-- %$* 13
that resulted in accuracy that's being produced on the battlefield? %$* 13
because your opponents are saying that they're sloppy. %$* 13
well, i think you have to say compared to what? %$* 439
and when one compares the accuracy and the killing and wounding of bystanders from drones compared to, for example, artillery which is another means of close air support from a manned aircraft. %$* 439
then it has fewer innocent casualties. %$* 439
that doesn't mean it's zero, and everyone as general schwartz said is to be greatly regretted, but it is a-- %$* 439
i can tell you, your regrets are fewer if you're operating drones than if you're shooting artillery or having manned aircraft being called in. %$* 439
okay, let me take that then to the other side-- %$* 13
take it to john kael weston. %$* 13
the other side is making a compelling argument that in fact the number of casualties is going to be lower than if somebody were dropping a bomb, firing an artillery shell, or even putting boots on the ground, that the proportion is lower. %$* 13
no, i think that the key part of the ratio of one to seven and one to five is the equals sign behind, and that equals sign is a factor of two, three, four, five. %$* 438
what basically i think we're losing focus of is what kind of reaction are you getting in village, after village, after village, and how many more enemies and how many more targets are you creating even if one afghan or one pakistani is killed. %$* 438
john, i want to let you have a run at that point, but it doesn't actually answer the question of-- %$* 13
i think that the numbers-- %$* 438
in terms of body count. %$* 13
the body count, yeah, i haven't been close to these drone strikes. %$* 438
you know, we tell ourselves often what we want to hear, and that gets translated into memos in washington, but the afghan and pakistani stories that i have heard is that it's-- %$* 438
whether it's one to seven or one to five, it's a lot more than any of us would like to admit to each other. %$* 438
so i don't want to argue numbers. %$* 438
i think it's a strategic equals sign at the end of the ratio that is the real problem. %$* 438
okay, i do want to come back to what you're talking about, the equals sign being the impact on the image of the united states, but i-- %$* 13
the other side has already heard you make that argument. %$* 13
so i want to give them a chance to respond to that, and i'll go to norton schwartz. %$* 13
so your opponents have said-- %$* 13
they've referred to the drones as a recruiting poster for al- qaeda because of the bitter resentment that is resulting in areas where they're being used, and do you see that? %$* 13
i understand the argument, but i-- %$* 440
but the counter to it is the reality that the u.n. reports that 80 to 84 percent of the civilian casualties in iraq and afghanistan were caused by the insurgency. %$* 440
general, i-- %$* 438
absolutely. %$* 438
i think muslims are killing more muslims than muslims were killing me, or the marines, or the generals that i worked with. %$* 438
they wanted to kill us. %$* 438
we're hard to get. %$* 438
i think the issue-- %$* 438
i-- %$* 440
you make my point. %$* 440
well-- %$* 438
but drones, you've made a point earlier on about pilots being somehow more rational, being removed from the battle, operating out of nellis air force base in nevada or wherever they're operating out of. %$* 438
i would disagree. %$* 438
we don't give medals for restraint, we give medals for combat valor, but i saw a lot of restraint on the front lines. %$* 438
look, your marines were rigorous about applying the rules of engagement, and so are our pilots, kale. %$* 440
the bottom line is this is about discipline, and i agree. %$* 440
civilian casualties is the equals sign, and everyone knows that. %$* 440
and are mistakes made from time to time? %$* 440
yes, but that is not the policy, nor is it the training, nor is it the supervision of those assets. %$* 440
ahmed rashid. %$* 13
look, i-- %$* 437
if i can just make one point, neither of you two, with all due respect, have addressed this whole issue about u.s.foreign policy and the use of drones. %$* 437
the fact is that today, you know, you are throwing technology at foreign policy conundrums where you should throw aid, or diplomats, or peacekeepers, or whatever it is. %$* 437
what we are seeing today in many parts of the world where drones are being used, that foreign policy is being subsumed by technology. %$* 437
we've never had this before. %$* 437
i mean, how can you allow technology to determine what your foreign policy-- %$* 437
are you saying, then, that drones represent a-- %$* 13
that drones in themselves represent a new dimension in this conflict? %$* 13
in other words, are you-- %$* 13
would you be making the same argument if planes were dropping bombs in these communities that you are making because drones are hovering over them? %$* 13
i'm saying that this is the impact that they are having in the countries that received these drones. %$* 437
this is what the public thinks. %$* 437
this is why there's so much-- %$* 437
but is that drone-- %$* 13
is that drone specific or is that ordinance? %$* 13
is that explosive specific? %$* 13
no, it's about drones because drones are a very sinister way of of killing people. %$* 437
i mean, they're not accepted as a normal-- %$* 437
all right, let me bring in dennis blair. %$* 13
general, let me just bring in dennis blair. %$* 13
kael, one second, and let's let them-- %$* 13
by saying the drones are going to come after you. %$* 438
you'll get your turn and-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 439
dennis blair. %$* 13
let me talk about yemen and just take us a little bit out of pakistan here for a while. %$* 439
in the last two years, we have given $200 million in assistance-- %$* 439
$600 million in assistance to yemen. %$* 439
of that, virtually two-thirds has been economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, and governance assistance. %$* 439
roughly one-third has gone to security assistance. %$* 439
that is, to yemen. %$* 439
and so, we do have a broad-based program in places like yemen. %$* 439
we are trying to work on places. %$* 439
the media impression, however, is fascinated with the drones. %$* 439
they're sexy. %$* 439
they're sinister. %$* 439
they're so on. %$* 439
so, i'm sorry, but the reality is that it is a broad-based program of which drones are a part and used very selectively. %$* 439
and the people who look carefully can understand that. %$* 439
the people who just want to read the first headline and say, "that's all of american policy" are going to stop there. %$* 439
you know, there are two narratives-- %$* 438
kael weston. %$* 13
at work here. %$* 438
there's the american narrative and there's their narrative. %$* 438
we spent a lot of time talking to each other about our narrative, but if you listen to the future leaders of afghanistan, you listen to the next generation-- %$* 438
drones is a big issues, because it is about the legalities. %$* 438
the law students at khost university used to ask me, "what is your case for drones? %$* 438
" just like guantanamo, just like the language of these wars that we're in. %$* 438
they are very, very big on how we're doing our wars. %$* 438
so, if we lose that narrative to al-qaeda, i think that ratio is actually the equals sign. %$* 438
and if i lined up a bunch of afghans on this stage, i can tell you, what they tell us is probably what we don't want to hear but we need to hear, and that's really the goal for me tonight, is to bring their voice into this debate. %$* 438
back on the issue, though, of whether-- %$* 438
you know-- %$* 438
but before you go to the issue-- %$* 13
and tell me what it is-- %$* 13
because i do want to remember it-- %$* 13
it's back to, you know, dropping bombs from nevada in pakistan. %$* 438
all right. %$* 13
i want to come back to it, because the point that you just made-- %$* 13
you're reporting from the ground. %$* 13
you're basically telling the high-ranking officers that you were there and that despite their understanding of the situation that because you're on the ground, you're reporting back what you think the afghans think, that you're sharing your perception of their hearts and minds. %$* 13
i just want to take that to this side. %$* 13
because i think it's offered in honesty. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
and so, what they're saying regardless of intentions and even the structure, that word is out not just in the american media, but the word is out in the communities that the drones are different, drones are more dangerous, drones-- %$* 13
you used the word "sinister," that it's a different kind of thing. %$* 13
i just want to-- %$* 13
if you were having dinner about this conversation, and he shared that-- %$* 13
just fact, what would you say to him? %$* 13
i-- %$* 440
it's pretty-- %$* 440
norton schwartz. %$* 13
straightforward, actually. %$* 440
and that is that the reality is that we have a scenario where the weapon-- %$* 440
the platform is not the issue. %$* 440
it's the legitimacy of the target. %$* 440
and the targeting methodology that goes along with it. %$* 440
could i put on the table the issue of double and triple tapping? %$* 438
there-- %$* 438
explain it-- %$* 13
explain it to-- %$* 13
are a number of cases where-- %$* 438
and i've lived this-- %$* 438
where-- %$* 438
especially in khost province, where mohammed atta was trained. %$* 438
this is territory directly tied to 9/11, unlike iraq. %$* 438
when you double and triple tap, you're not even going after the initial target. %$* 438
you're actually dropping bombs on the people that come after round 2 or round 3. what's the rationale? %$* 438
what's the intelligence? %$* 438
what's the argument that you would make to a law student sitting at khost university. %$* 438
one second. %$* 13
did everybody follow what double tap and triple tap means? %$* 13
no? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it's when-- %$* 13
basically, it's a follow-up-- %$* 13
it's a second wave, a third wave-- %$* 13
of bombs. %$* 438
attack. %$* 13
and what kael is saying, that he believes he's seen it happen, where the second wave comes when the firefighters and the hospital people are around. %$* 13
i think that's what you-- %$* 13
family members-- %$* 438
okay. %$* 13
community member, whoever it is. %$* 438
they-- %$* 438
all right. %$* 13
i just wanted to-- %$* 13
get bombed, too. %$* 438
have clarity for you on that. %$* 13
but just to-- %$* 440
norton schwartz. %$* 13
set the stage, when i became the chief in 2008, we had 32 24/7 orbits of remote aircraft. %$* 440
when i left, we had 58.now, we didn't do that because we're sort of generous. %$* 440
the reason we did it is because there was a demand signal from the supportive forces, the marines and the army-- %$* 440
could i-- %$* 438
to-- %$* 440
no. %$* 440
no. %$* 440
kael, let him finish. %$* 13
let me finish. %$* 440
to provide the kind of overhead surveillance and strike capability that minimized the risk to their forces. %$* 440
and i would argue, kael, that this was not just some perception in washington, but this was real down on the ground. %$* 440
no. %$* 438
i-- %$* 438
general, you know, i have the greatest respect for you. %$* 438
my sand is still deep in my shoes, and so i bring baggage with me. %$* 438
however, i found that the commanders on the ground are the 12 to 14 marine generals i worked with-- %$* 438
the closer they were to the drones, the more skeptical they were. %$* 438
doesn't mean that all of your arguments are false. %$* 438
it doesn't mean i think every drone needs to be, you know, eliminated from the battlefield. %$* 438
but the closer you are to where the strategic effect is with the people, the more critical i found the marine commanders to be. %$* 438
i don't want to speak for all of them, but it was-- %$* 438
it was a pretty clear pattern %$* 438
they should probably speak for themselves. %$* 440
ahmed rashid, i want to move this to-- %$* 13
in a different direction. %$* 13
your opponents have made the point, repeatedly, particularly in their opening statements, that the drones have killed a lot of guys that they were supposed to kill, that they have decimated al- qaeda; and that al-qaeda is on the way to becoming a footnote in history because of it, which was the whole purpose. %$* 13
these are the guys who blew up buildings in this city. %$* 13
do you dispute their effectiveness in-- %$* 13
on that agenda? %$* 13
no, i don't dispute their effectiveness. %$* 437
obviously, this is a military weapon that has been developed to do a certain thing. %$* 437
and it is going to be further developed, and it's going to be used even more. %$* 437
i think the point is that it is being-- %$* 437
it is being used very indiscriminately and without any kind of scrutiny or self-knowledge even amongst americans. %$* 437
the whole issue of legality, the whole issue of the precedent that it sets for other countries to follow, there are a whole range of political issues and political answers that are needed in order for this weapon to be really legal, be legitimate and be justified. %$* 437
and that is the point. %$* 437
i don't dispute at all that certainly many senior members of al-qaeda have been killed. %$* 437
but this is a weapon that has opened up a pandora's box of questions, especially for those countries who are in receipt of this weapon, you know, at the receiving end. %$* 437
and i think we need-- %$* 437
we need answers. %$* 437
i think this question of precedent is absolutely paramount at the moment with what-- %$* 437
if syria is using-- %$* 437
let's take it to dennis blair. %$* 13
just because you've discovered the drones doesn't mean that this is the first time that anybody has ever thought about these questions. %$* 439
this is a weapons system which combines the capabilities of surveillance and attack, and it is operated according to the rules of law, the control procedures, the follow up procedures that the u.s.armed forces use for all of the weapon systems that we have over the years. %$* 439
we know how to take new weapon systems, use them for mission purposes, control them so that they're done legally, with lawyers in the command loop to a much greater extent than they are for most any other weapons, and you use them for your purpose, and you try to minimize the harmful side effects of which there are many, as there are for any weapon systems in order to get the mission done. %$* 439
and that's how we do it. %$* 439
i'm going to let this side respond. %$* 13
i just want to let the audience know that after this response i want to start going to your questions. %$* 13
and the way this will work, if you raise your hand, and i call on you, just stand where you are. %$* 13
somebody will come down the mic-- %$* 13
aisle and hand a microphone to you. %$* 13
hold it about this distance from your mouth so that the radio broadcast can get you. %$* 13
we would really like it if you would state your name and then ask a tight, focused question that's on point for us. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
let's go to this side for the response. %$* 13
just briefly, i want to actually give voice to a real live afghan. %$* 438
and i'm going to read a quote. %$* 438
when that incident happened that the new york times covered, a friend of mine went to a tribal elder, and this is what the tribal elder said. %$* 438
“siraj haqqani, the senior most leader of the haqqani said that since the usa is using drones against people, the people will use patriot missiles against the u.s.a. someone in the village asked what he meant, where are the patriot missiles? %$* 438
siraj replied, ‘suicide bombers are our patriot missiles.’" the question i don't think we still had answered, for example, on the legality question-- %$* 438
and i know we're not in a law seminar, but it's an important one because it's what motivates terrorists to hurt us. %$* 438
because at the end of the day, i think everyone in this room needs to ask fundamental question, which is, are you and your family safer because of the drone program as it's currently structured, or not? %$* 438
what is the legality of the third wave of drone strikes in terms of the triple tap? %$* 438
what is the legality of that? %$* 438
what are the lawyers in washington arguing? %$* 438
they're not the initial targets. %$* 438
there's not intel tied to them. %$* 438
norman schwartz. %$* 13
if you are in a declared combat area, as was the case in fallujah or in other areas that you're familiar with, if you have combatants that depart that initial strike area, this is not unlike what happened with zarqawi. %$* 440
the bottom line was, now, that was a manned strike. %$* 440
and hopefully, i make no apologize for that either. %$* 440
but the bottom line is that we have a situation where you have people that depart a site that-- %$* 440
that had combatants, that was identified as a location. %$* 440
and they depart that area, and you reengage. %$* 440
this is what happens when people leave a foxhole or when people depart a tank in a tank battle. %$* 440
the bottom line, kael, i think is that you argue for discretion. %$* 440
i believe in that too. %$* 440
but on the battlefield, the principle is to engage the enemy. %$* 440
it is that. %$* 440
well, we went through a phase in fallujah where everyone was a military-aged male. %$* 438
and i finally told the generals in baghdad-- %$* 438
at that point, i was young enough that i was still a military-aged male according to our definition. %$* 438
we then switched that definition because we started to treat every iraqi as a potential threat. %$* 438
and i'll be honest with you, if you're a taliban member, and you're living in a community around family and friends, with all due respect, i don't think that that makes you a legitimate target. %$* 438
and that's in effect what's been happening. %$* 438
i agree with that. %$* 440
i agree. %$* 440
but if you're carrying an arm, if you have a weapon, i would argue in a combat zone, that makes you a legitimate target. %$* 440
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
right down in the front here. %$* 13
and the point is you can see the weapons from these platforms. %$* 440
yes and no. %$* 438
thank you for taking my question. %$* 441
i just wanted to address this question-- %$* 441
would you mind telling us your name? %$* 13
oh, my name is jordan bennett %$* 441
thanks. %$* 13
i just wanted to address this question to the gentlemen on the left. %$* 441
you bring up these points that the afghani people, the pakistani people are upset, and it's increasing recruitment for al-qaeda and other anti-u.s.sentiment in these areas because we're using drones. %$* 441
would the effect not be the same if we were using cluster bombs or snipers or land mines or any other way of killing these people? %$* 441
is it the drone that's the issue or is it just killing them? %$* 441
that's an excellent question. %$* 13
i had actually put it before, and didn't feel that i got answered. %$* 13
so thank you for bringing it up a second time. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
let's put it to-- %$* 13
let's put it to ahmed rashid. %$* 13
no, it is a drone. %$* 437
the drones are an issue because as i said, this is the most sinister weapon that has come into the marketplace, that, you know, there's no individual behind it. %$* 437
there's no judgments being made. %$* 437
and people are very, very scared. %$* 437
ahmed, you-- %$* 13
ahmed, i just want to ask you, because it's a bold statement. %$* 13
you're seriously saying no judgments are being made in these-- %$* 13
after everything %$* 13
well, this is what people presume, that somehow, these automatic weapons come up into the sky, and they shoot at will, and they shoot down whatever is on the ground. %$* 437
i mean, there are all sorts of stories and mythologies about drones which, unfortunately have been created. %$* 437
and-- %$* 437
and as i said, this is why this weapon-- %$* 437
the chances of this weapon getting out of hand, getting into the wrong hands and being used indiscriminately in many other parts of the world is-- %$* 437
you know, we should take the example of what the reaction already we are seeing in pakistan, yemen and other places. %$* 437
i'll briefly-- %$* 438
rules of engagement are pretty tight in marine combat units. %$* 438
and so, yes, there's going to be blowback. %$* 438
it's a good question. %$* 438
it's a very legitimate question. %$* 438
the drones are being used in pakistan, northwest province basically, outside which is a very different arena than in the conventional side, on the afghan side of the border. %$* 438
bottom line is, though is it's what the rules-- %$* 438
the lack of the rules actually, i believe, in our drone program that is the biggest problem. %$* 438
there is not, for example, a marine general necessarily that technically can command where those drones go because they're operated in a different chain of command. %$* 438
and we don't need to get too technical, and that may be changing. %$* 438
but, yes, afghans are going to respond to a cluster bomb going off or an rpg being launched in the wrong direction. %$* 438
but i have faith that our forces, if one thing over 12 years have learned, is they've learned quite a bit of restraint. %$* 438
and then the rules of engagement have gotten a lot tighter. %$* 438
here's my bias tonight. %$* 13
we have five guys on the stage, and all i see are guys raising their hands. %$* 13
are there any women who would like to get their voices into this conversation? %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
be good, okay. %$* 13
if i could just-- %$* 13
stand up. %$* 13
well, i'll try. %$* 19
hi. %$* 19
my name is elisa. %$* 19
and this is directed towards and admiral blair and general schwartz. %$* 19
and we talked a lot about how the drones may be causing a lot of innocent civilians to really have hate towards the american people. %$* 19
so do you think that the number of terrorists who have successfully killed using drones is greater than the number of young people who will be conditioned to hate america from the drone strikes and therefore become terrorists themselves? %$* 19
but do you seriously-- %$* 13
i mean, i see where you're getting with the question. %$* 13
they just can't count on that. %$* 13
they can't count-- %$* 13
oh, of course not. %$* 19
they wouldn't have a count. %$* 13
but your larger point is-- %$* 13
i mean, i'm just kind of rephrasing, but your larger point is, are they creating more enemies than they're killing? %$* 13
is that basically what you're-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
that is, yeah, the basis of my question. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
so you don't mind if they answer that with the question phrased that way? %$* 13
yes, no, of course. %$* 19
i want you to have ownership. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
that's good. %$* 19
okay, so go ahead. %$* 13
i think it's a great question, i just didn't want to-- %$* 13
i didn't want their dodge to be, "well, i don't have account of that." i wanted-- %$* 13
okay, go ahead. %$* 13
that wasn't going to be my dodge. %$* 439
dennis blair. %$* 13
it's a judgment. %$* 439
it's a judgment. %$* 439
if there were a wonder weapon that would only kill al- qaeda, dedicated card carrying members, would touch no one else, could be deployed from this room by pressing this button, i'd be all for it. %$* 439
we'd use it. %$* 439
we'd invent it first, and then we'd use it. %$* 439
it doesn't. %$* 439
we have a set of imperfect tools that we use to try to deal with this group of people who has declared war on us and who is far less discriminate, more ruthless, more killing in their approach than we are. %$* 439
and you have to make a call as to just how hard you use that weapon because it kills other people and it causes other effects which our opponents have ably said. %$* 439
i think that judgment has to be made to continually reevaluate it as you go, and i'm sure that there have been times in the past in which we have erred on the side of using it too much. %$* 439
i think we learned from those, and as the president has said in his opening statements, or his statements, in recent weeks, we've decided to cut it down so i think it's a judgment, and i think we're making it in the right direction. %$* 439
i'm not sure, though, that you answered the question of whether-- %$* 13
i think a different-- %$* 439
you think it's really-- %$* 13
whether you think the blow back is so serious-- %$* 13
in other words, are you saying that-- %$* 13
and she's to some degree channeling this side's argument, that it - - the use of the weapon, the way it's being used, it creating such ill will that it's creating enemies, and i'm not sure that you addressed whether you think that it is or not or whether you think it is, but not enough to make it a disqualifier for the weapon. %$* 13
i think the only overall judgment we can make is that al-qaeda is far less capable of the sort of attacks that it was in the past than it is now. %$* 439
drones have been a part of reducing it in that capability and, therefore, overall the balance is in favor of the sort of campaign the united states has conducted. %$* 439
and i would only amplify by-- %$* 440
norton schwartz. %$* 13
if i may, by suggesting that you have a situation where you want desperately to avoid having a larger military presence, which i-- %$* 440
, clearly would have its own negative effect on local population perceptions. %$* 440
so my counter question would be, "what's the alternative? %$* 440
what is the least intrusive, invasive alternative? %$* 440
that, we have been seeking for some time. %$* 440
and all i can tell you is that every flag-- %$* 440
senior flag officer on the military side that has looked at this problem, has sought that solution. %$* 440
that's the question i'd like to put to the other side since you've actually phrased it as a question. %$* 13
if you want to kill al-qaeda in these hard to reach places today, what is the alternative to the drones? %$* 13
kael weston. %$* 13
my view has always been the most important battle going on does not include u.s.marines versus taliban. %$* 438
it's inside the mosques, inside the madrasas, it's inside the communities. %$* 438
and actually our best allies are the ones that are most critical of this program. %$* 438
so if we're undercutting-- %$* 438
bottom line you are saying not to try to kill them. %$* 13
well, no, no. %$* 438
i-- %$* 438
yeah, i'm not a person that says, "all drones need to be taken off-- %$* 438
out of the sky." but what i am saying is that we've lost the strategic narratives so that general, i'm all in favor of not sending in the first marine division anywhere again for the most part. %$* 438
however, i think that we've lost sight of who the best fighters are in these battles. %$* 438
and it's actually not an american anywhere. %$* 438
it's an afghan. %$* 438
it's a yemeni. %$* 438
it's a pakistani. %$* 438
so when you listen to our allies who want us to succeed, who want us to be safe, they are pretty uniform in their indictment of drones, and-- %$* 438
if they don't control their own territory. %$* 440
well, that's a government to government discussion. %$* 438
i agree with that. %$* 438
as far as the tactic, it's what ahmed my well spoken and famous colleague here at the table have said, which is that the tactic can't be the strategy. %$* 438
we've enabled the tactic to become a failed strategy and a failed narrative. %$* 438
but, ahmed, it's the-- %$* 13
coming back to the question that your opponents put a minute ago, if the goal of the strategy is to destroy al-qaeda physically, what alternative is there to drones to reach them in these places where it's very hard to get to? %$* 13
well, i think there's no doubt that there are obviously ungoverned areas and the pakistanis have not been active enough in undermining and destroying al-qaeda. %$* 437
but i also think that u.s. policy has-- %$* 437
there's been enormous tension between the u.s.and pakistan over the years, as there has been between yemen and the u.s.now, it's not all centered around drones, but it's centered around, frankly, a lack of long-term strategy and vision by both countries. %$* 437
and both are to blame. %$* 437
now, i think what we need is much greater diplomacy and, you know, diplomatic efforts to strike better relationships. %$* 437
we had a situation where-- %$* 437
as you know-- %$* 437
but just so, just to get to my point-- %$* 13
and i'll-- %$* 13
then i'll let you continue-- %$* 13
are you saying, therefore, that a campaign at this point, to continue to try to kill al-qaeda operatives, planners, et cetera, strategists, by the united states, is ill-founded? %$* 13
they should stop trying to kill them by drones or any other means? %$* 13
no. %$* 437
i think they should continue trying to kill them. %$* 437
they should be urging the pakistanis to do much more to do this. %$* 437
this is the problem, you know? %$* 437
okay. %$* 13
well, yeah, there's a lot of mythology about what seals and drones can do together. %$* 438
and i think what-- %$* 438
the american people look at joystick warfare and think, "well, why not have seals and drones fix everything? %$* 438
" but that's also not a strategy. %$* 438
ma'am? %$* 13
a mike is coming down from the aisle for you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 442
my name is colleen quinn. %$* 442
this question is for admiral blair. %$* 442
admiral, i was very pleased to see that you are also a member of the security leadership council, securing america's future energy. %$* 442
so, you all here today are talking about, you know, overall strategies for the u.s. and one of the things that particular council talks about is how we can frankly, you know, develop alternative energies to-- %$* 442
so that we can-- %$* 442
ma'am, i apologize. %$* 13
not-- %$* 442
oh, sorry. %$* 442
i need the topic to be on the motion. %$* 13
oh, okay. %$* 442
sorry. %$* 442
but thanks anyway. %$* 13
you missed my briefing. %$* 13
right down in front, right by-- %$* 13
but you can chat afterward. %$* 13
i think it's a great cause. %$* 439
thank you. %$* 439
that's an easier debate for you to have, that's for sure. %$* 438
could you stand, please? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
yes. %$* 443
ellie roth i just want to know, who decides what drones are to be sent out? %$* 443
is it the cia that tells the military? %$* 443
that's the mystery. %$* 443
when we hear about drone strikes, we don't understand who's responsible, who's made the decision. %$* 443
is it policy, is it someone who's mad at someone? %$* 443
okay. %$* 13
i'll let these guys answer your question. %$* 13
let's go to admiral blair-- %$* 13
dennis blair. %$* 13
right. %$* 439
the decision on what is a target can be struck either by a military or by an intelligence cia drone is made under criteria that are approved by the white house, that are then promulgated. %$* 439
and a series of officials, including lawyers, officials in each of those agencies and the chains of command, then apply them to actual names of al-qaeda and other combatants. %$* 439
once they satisfy that criteria, then they are a legitimate target at that point. %$* 439
the question is, can you truly tell-- %$* 439
is that a person that you found and can strike, and is there a relatively small level of collateral damage? %$* 439
that is, innocent people around that person before you make the strike. %$* 439
that's how it's done. %$* 439
so, dennis blair, your opponent ahmed rashid has mentioned-- %$* 13
and i said that i would get back to this whole notion of signature strikes, in which the target is chosen by a pattern of suspicious-looking behavior, maybe going frequently to a house where there are known to be bad guys. %$* 13
and then he's tracked back to his house. %$* 13
you don't know his name. %$* 13
you don't know who he is, but he's targeted because it's an association or some other pattern that i'm unfamiliar with. %$* 13
and i want to know, do you put that in a different category? %$* 13
is that morally more challenging an issue, when you don't actually have a name, but you just have a kind of profile? %$* 13
it is. %$* 440
norton schwartz. %$* 13
it certainly is. %$* 440
now, signature strikes in a declared combat area are different than those that occur outside declared combat areas. %$* 440
and i-- %$* 440
and the criteria are different. %$* 440
but the bottom line is, if in a combat area, if the individual or individuals appear to be hostile, you can engage them in the context of that signature of hostility. %$* 440
on the other hand, activities in non-combat areas-- %$* 440
and this does apply to pakistan, i would argue-- %$* 440
it is much more problematic to conduct signature strikes there or elsewhere, where it's not a declared combat zone. %$* 440
yeah. %$* 439
i can talk about those, because i received the phone calls every-- %$* 439
dennis-- %$* 13
time we conducted a strike. %$* 439
this is up to the middle of 2010.and i think that the administration has been really derelict in not talking about these, because they are based on the self-defense of american and afghan forces. %$* 439
the signature strikes that were conducted in pakistan, all of them during my time, and the great majority over all, had to do with armed groups of men who were coming out of known taliban, ttp areas on road headed towards afghanistan. %$* 439
and we knew that they were not friendly. %$* 439
they were armed. %$* 439

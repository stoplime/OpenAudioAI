well, a little bit, there is a little bit of philosophical thing going on here where it's like is this a chair? %$* 277
you know, like, well, it has three legs and not four. %$* 277
and i never saw somebody sit on it, but you could. %$* 277
and i mean, you know, the boundaries of a chair gets fuzzy. %$* 277
so what makes a war a war? %$* 277
well, we've heard a couple things. %$* 277
who are the actors involved? %$* 277
if the person initiating the hurling of a stone at someone is a state actor, could it be a war? %$* 277
well, if the stone hit somebody from another state, if a south korean soldier in the demilitarized zone hurls a stone at his north korean counterpart, squarely trying to hit him, is that an act of war? %$* 277
is that an act of war, mike? %$* 277
i think it might be. %$* 479
i think it might be too. %$* 277
let's just say that we should not try that experiment right now. %$* 277
you know? %$* 277
worse has happened on that peninsula, and it started from lesser things. %$* 277
and then you look, all right, what's the motive and what's the effect? %$* 277
now, what i hear is, yes, the canonical, platonic form of war is like the digital representation-- %$* 277
this is for a younger generation. %$* 277
in the “lord of the rings” series, when all those monsters are going up against each other, all right, that's a war. %$* 277
right? %$* 277
that's a platonic form. %$* 277
but you can take away a leg or two and still have the fundamental truth be, one, are we exposed? %$* 277
absolutely. %$* 277
and what are we exposed to? %$* 277
it may not be a bomb coming down our middle chimney of our house, but it could be something that greatly affects our way of life. %$* 277
if you indulge mike's hypothetical and say what if tomorrow those two banks could be taken out, and suddenly everybody that had some claim to those $7 trillion has no idea to whom it belongs, nor can they prove it. %$* 277
seems to me that's a predicate with the right actors in place to be an act of war. %$* 277
jonathan, this seems to boil down to-- %$* 13
and i don't want to get into this rhetorical tangle here. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 277
but the word "threat" is in there, and it seems to-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 277
the word "threat" means something that could happen. %$* 13
and the question is you are saying we should be really, really, really, worried about what could happen. %$* 13
and you're saying not so much. %$* 13
and you're saying they have motives for trying to scare us. %$* 13
but are you ever-- %$* 13
and you know what damage can be done. %$* 13
bruce, that's what you do for a living is protect-- %$* 13
is protect a company. %$* 13
are you-- %$* 13
are you able to sleep at night in terms of the stuff that could happen? %$* 13
so this is actually interesting. %$* 480
as security guys, we tend to think all about the bad stuff. %$* 480
but, i mean, you go out in the audience, your bank account's actually fine, all right? %$* 480
your identity hasn't been stolen tonight. %$* 480
we talk a lot about the threats. %$* 480
and in my business, we have conferences on the threats. %$* 480
you write papers on the threats. %$* 480
all we do is threats. %$* 480
but actually most of the world works pretty well pretty much all the time. %$* 480
the internet works. %$* 480
the pens go to the back of the room, the beer gets passed, and life goes on. %$* 480
yes, there are vulnerabilities, but the networks, right, i mean sure-- %$* 480
yes, there's espionage going on. %$* 480
a lot of companies keep a lot of secrets? %$* 480
so, yeah, it's easy to sleep at night because we are safe. %$* 480
by and large, we are safe. %$* 480
yes, there are threats. %$* 480
there are common threats. %$* 480
i mean, you could look at the number of-- %$* 480
amount of money stolen from identity theft, right, some cyber crime. %$* 480
and it's a big number. %$* 480
but it's a much bigger number, money that isn't stolen. %$* 480
yes, there's bad stuff going on, but it's rare. %$* 480
it's in the noise. %$* 480
we are safe. %$* 13
three very important words. %$* 13
are we-- %$* 13
jonathan, respond to are we safe? %$* 13
no, we are not safe. %$* 277
i wanted to put to bruce the question i said i put to ed. %$* 277
bruce, if you had a crack team, nsa left you a team of good spooks, and you have two weeks-- %$* 277
not signing them up just yet. %$* 277
you have two weeks, and you have to wreak maximum havoc among the devices in consumer land. %$* 277
the people you just told should feel safe in their homes and businesses. %$* 277
you have to wreak maximum havoc. %$* 277
i know it's against interests to answer it. %$* 277
but tell me just how far could you go? %$* 277
so, we talk about this. %$* 480
and actually, after-- %$* 480
in crypto conferences, security conferences, people get beers at the end of the night. %$* 480
and we have these conversations. %$* 480
and-- %$* 480
i mean, there's a side that-- %$* 480
this is just among us here. %$* 277
right. %$* 480
there's a side that says, well, you know, new introduction of a microsoft operating system is indistinguishable from a big denial of service attack. %$* 480
so, you know, you've got these sorts of things happening-- %$* 480
we have these things happening sort of normally. %$* 480
we had an at&t satellite go out because of software updates, and a lot of people's pagers didn't work. %$* 480
these sorts of things do happen. %$* 480
you can do damage but we recover. %$* 480
we're actually really good at recovering. %$* 480
and i don't think given two weeks and a crack team, you could take down the internet. %$* 480
you could make people real annoyed. %$* 480
you can make-- %$* 480
actually probably get paid overtime-- %$* 480
but the techies who have to fix their computers and networks are going to have a bunch of sleepless nights, but it's not going to take down the-- %$* 480
it's not going to do irreparable damage to our country, to our society. %$* 480
this is not an existential threat. %$* 480
i mean, nothing like that; this is around the edges. %$* 480
okay. %$* 13
i want to in a moment go to questions from the audience, so i want to start that process. %$* 13
we'll get the microphones out there and once again i want to remind you to hold the microphone a fist's distance away from your mouth, to really ask a question that is a question, and to try to keep it on our topic, and we'll come to you in just a moment. %$* 13
but mike mcconnell, i want to give you a chance to respond to what you just heard. %$* 13
i want to go back to the word, "war," and just remind the audience, cold war, there were no russians marching down pennsylvania avenue until we won. %$* 479
and they were on the friendly side. %$* 479
so this-- %$* 479
careful of the use of the word "war." marc said that's a nation state attacking another nation state, we did not exchange nuclear weapons with the soviets. %$* 479
we prevailed in that war. %$* 479
it's the metaphor of war. %$* 479
now, also, marc, earlier in our introduction, accused me of tapping his telephone, and he also just made reference to me stacking the audience with family and friends. %$* 479
now, i would love to have done that however it is against the law-- %$* 479
it is against the law to tap marc's telephone-- %$* 479
you got it. %$* 478
unless he is guilty of a crime, and that goes completely out of the context of the national security agency and becomes a law enforcement issue which is controlled by a judiciary process. %$* 479
mike, let me bring to you a question that actually goes to the issues that concern marc. %$* 13
there is a bill that's sort of sitting in the senate, a lot of cyber-- %$* 13
to address cyber threat, and one of the provisions in the bill was to give the president the power to disconnect a company or to disconnect even a government agency from the internet if he thought it was a threat. %$* 13
and ultimately that provision slipped away because of pressure from groups like marc. %$* 13
do you think it was a mistake for that provision to go away? %$* 13
if you-- %$* 13
no, i do not. %$* 479
i do not. %$* 479
but let me just add a little more context, there are now 40, 40-- %$* 479
four zero-- %$* 479
bills, resolutions, or amendments on the hill circulating, and let me remind you of what mark twain said about that. %$* 479
no man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session. %$* 479
this is a debate that involves you in this room, the citizens, being informed about this process, the scare tactics of the government tapping your telephone; that cannot happen with the right law. %$* 479
oh, my god. %$* 478
it cannot happen without the right-- %$* 479
without the law. %$* 479
does the phrase “warrantless wiretapping" mean anything this evening? %$* 478
i mean, come on, mike, let's be serious. %$* 478
the past administration violated the u.s. constitution and you pushed for-- %$* 478
is it appropriate to be interrupted-- %$* 479
yeah. %$* 13
actually, i-- %$* 13
that no one would be held accountable. %$* 478
all of that may be true but it's actually a different debate. %$* 13
that's an incredible statement. %$* 478
that's a different debate. %$* 13
and, mike, i want to go back to the question-- %$* 13
but we should go to that debate. %$* 478
that's what this debate is. %$* 478
we'll be back and we'll book it. %$* 13
notice that-- %$* 478
i want you to go to my question, why don't you want to give the president the power to do this? %$* 13
because the president can put troops on the street, he can close down ports, why not give the president the power to-- %$* 13
notice that marc came for a different debate. %$* 479
now, let me answer your question. %$* 479
you don't want to concentrate that kind of power with a bill on the hill that is not thought out. %$* 479
my argument is this is very, very complex. %$* 479
my opposition here made reference to my comments about cold war and nuclear weapons. %$* 479
the reason i made that reference is we didn't know what to do with nuclear weapons. %$* 479
we didn't know how to control them. %$* 479
we didn't know what our doctrine would be and so on. %$* 479
so in the late '40s, early '50s, we had the best minds in this country-- %$* 479
it was called the solarium project-- %$* 479
two things came out of that work, containment and nuclear deterrence. %$* 479
and what it said was never ever use them. %$* 479
it built the framework which allowed us to prevail in the cold war. %$* 479
and that's the argument i'm making here. %$* 479
it's not about warrantless surveillance, easy to say, hard to refute. %$* 479
all right, i'd like to go to some questions from the audience now and, sir, with the microphone. %$* 13
thank you for being there. %$* 13
and i apologize that i didn't meet you before and know your name, but there's a gentleman in a blue shirt, and if you can rise, sir-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i just want to wait 10 seconds so that the cameras can find you and i think that’s probably good. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
go ahead, please. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 18
this question is primarily for mr. %$* 18
schneier and mr. %$* 18
rotenberg. %$* 18
we’ve heard a lot of examples tonight about nefarious cyberspace activity as the defining event itself, but i think we’ve seen examples of nefarious cyberspace activities as part a more conventional conflict, when russia invaded i believe it was georgia. %$* 18
is it grossly exaggerated to believe that nefarious cyberspace activities might be used as part of a more conventional conflict against the u.s. or one of our allies and if that is grossly exaggerated, who should be in charge of ensuring that our networks are not overrun in that event? %$* 18
at least take part one of that question, yes. %$* 13
mr. %$* 13
schneier. %$* 13
i think it would be silly of anyone to think that any future war will not include a cyberspace theater, all right? %$* 480
war encompasses all theaters: land, water and air space, cyberspace. %$* 480
war will fill the available space. %$* 480
this side agrees. %$* 277
so yes, so if there is war, there will be a cyber component. %$* 480
georgia’s interesting. %$* 480
so georgia was an actual tanks rolling in invasion and there were some website deface-- %$* 480
non-service attacks. %$* 480
we don’t actually know who did that. %$* 480
you know a lot of what we’re talking about, we talk about cyber wars, are kids playing politics. %$* 480
and you see it. %$* 480
you see israel and palestine, you saw u.s.and china, you know, when the u.s.spy plane had to land in china a bunch of years ago. %$* 480
i saw india-pakistan when the sort of nuclear tests were going on. %$* 480
i mean, you see this all the time that it’s cyber-activism, it’s kids playing politics and we actually don’t know. %$* 480
it’s sort of odd to think that as you’re rolling in tanks you’re going to make it so people can’t visit some website. %$* 480
they’re probably not paying attention to that right now. %$* 480
but if you’re someone who’s rooting for your side, that’s what you can do. %$* 480
so, yeah, it’s hard to know what these things were but any future war will certainly include a cyber component. %$* 480
jonathan, do you have anything to add to that that moves it from where we are? %$* 13
well, we actually saw in the recent russia-georgia conflict a number of georgian blocks on the web. %$* 277
we infer that it might be the georgian government actually trying to keep some of its own people from getting some of the bad news too early but certainly a component of that war was a cyber strategy. %$* 277
and we’ve seen it in other instances, whether it’s disputed elections or other things actually attacking cyber infrastructure because information is really key and if people are confused and they don’t know what’s going on and they’re relying on the internet, they tossed their television set or they don’t know how to work it, that’s a problem. %$* 277
right. %$* 480
i mean, iran’s an example of that, the elections in iran. %$* 480
a lot of the information came out in cyberspace. %$* 480
iranian government’s trying to block it and, you know, activists around the world trying to counter that. %$* 480
i mean, lots of great stuff. %$* 480
not exactly war, but they were good things. %$* 480
john, could i add some-- %$* 479
let me add just a couple of facts about the russian conflict. %$* 479
that cyber-- %$* 479
those cyber attacks were deliberate. %$* 479
i agree with the way that bruce is describing it. %$* 479
there was a lot of piling on. %$* 479
but what happened was deliberate, it was rehearsed ahead of time and it was effective in shutting down the georgian government and the georgian government was defeated. %$* 479
the russians achieved their objective and that’s an example of how you would interface in a current conventional conflict the ability to attack the other side’s capability to communicate, to coordinate, to integrate their forces. %$* 479
the georgians lost. %$* 479
we have a question in the front row so if you could stand up, and the microphone is on its way. %$* 13
so, jonathan zittrain in his opening remarks mentioned that the internet is broken, that people are running protocols that are insecure, and that’s it’s easier for a malicious or incompetent service provider in pakistan to direct all of the world’s youtube traffic to that provider. %$* 18
and i think bruce and many others would agree that many consumers and people are running out of data protocols on out of date software. %$* 18
we’re not hearing, though, any calls for increasing national science foundation funding or any calls for-- %$* 18
so what’s your question? %$* 13
the question is if the problem is that we’re running out of date software or the problem is that we have an insecure internet, why are we not calling for secure software and regulation of technology companies rather than giving power to the dod and nsa who have never done anything to fix the internet or fix security problems? %$* 18
nsa is in the business of finding flaws, not fixing flaws. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
the part of your question that i want to bring to mike because it’s entirely unfocused is that the government has never done anything to protect the internet. %$* 13
is that true? %$* 13
let's start with the fact that darpa invented the internet. %$* 479
so that's a good start place. %$* 479
there are two organizations that-- %$* 479
it wasn’t their job to secure it. %$* 18
true, because it was designed to be open and unassailable. %$* 479
however, it is what it is. %$* 479
there are two organizations that make encryption code for the federal government. %$* 479
one is the national security agency to protect secrets, and the other is the national institute of standards and technology for unclassified protection. %$* 479
there is an initiative calls cnci, comprehensive national cyber security initiative, and it does exactly what you just said it didn't do. %$* 479
it is to direct funding into the national science foundation, produce a cyber corps, now it's a word, cyber corps. %$* 479
what does that mean? %$* 479
it means teaching kids double e and computer science and understanding so they can make this process better. %$* 479
if you're old enough to remember sputnik-- %$* 479
1957, most of you probably don't remember that. %$* 479
immediately after, we had a bill that started sending kids to school for double e and computer science. %$* 479
i went to college on that bill. %$* 479
otherwise i would have been not able to go. %$* 479
so this debate is about doing what you just said. %$* 479
it's not about accusing nsa of spying and warrantless surveillance or saying dod doesn't do its job. %$* 479
it's about a debate that causes us to invest the resources and train our people so that we can securely rely on something we have become dependent on. %$* 479
sir, what do you think of marc rotenberg's concerns with the sorts of measures that you seem to be asking for when you said the government isn't doing anything about it is the sort of-- %$* 13
would invite the kinds of government interference that he finds scary and terrifying. %$* 13
i'll bring the mic back to you. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
well, i didn't say terrifying, exactly. %$* 18
you didn't. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
totally, you didn't. %$* 13
and that's a very good point. %$* 13
the threat of him saying terrifying has been totally exaggerated. %$* 480
and i-- %$* 13
if you can be brief. %$* 13
but he's concerned that the sorts of remedies that i think that you're asking for could be disastrous for privacy. %$* 13
i think marc is scared of the nsa which is not subject to any oversight. %$* 18
i don't think he's scared of a transparent process to improve internet security. %$* 18
okay. %$* 478
so let me clarify. %$* 478
tonight's debate topic’s not whether or not marc's scared, okay? %$* 478
we're not going to go there. %$* 478
we're having a policy discussion, a very important policy discussion. %$* 478
and i'm still having a little difficulty following what mike mcconnell is saying. %$* 478
he said the nsa is not interested. %$* 478
they're not going to get involved, not a big deal. %$* 478
a couple months ago, in the washington post, he's writing we need to develop an early warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions, locate the source of attacks. %$* 478
and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. %$* 478
and then you say we need to reengineer the internet to make attribution, geo location, intelligence analysis and impact assessment, the result more manageable. %$* 478
this is exactly-- %$* 478
but i think he-- %$* 13
i think he's fessing up to all of this. %$* 13
yes, but here's the point about it, okay? %$* 478
and this is why this is a very important question. %$* 478
if the goal were to promote security, reliability, stability the way we talked in the internet community about responding to security threats, we would have unclassified programs. %$* 478
we'd be doing education and training. %$* 478
we'd be responding to user concerns. %$* 478
but that's not the model that we're moving forward now. %$* 478
in fact the model that mike just described a moment ago, the cnci is a classified document prepared by president bush. %$* 478
he was there at white house meeting in 2008.we're still trying to get public disclosure of that document because right now we have a secret cyber security policy. %$* 478
we can't even talk about it. %$* 478
i mean, we can imagine what's in it, but we don't even know what the document says. %$* 478
mike knows what the document says, but we don't. %$* 478
can i just say-- %$* 277
can i just say-- %$* 277
it's posted on the white house website if you'd like to read it. %$* 479
no, not the original document. %$* 478
jonathan, can you be brief, because i want to move on. %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 478
don't say that. %$* 478
jonathan zittrain of harvard. %$* 13
on behalf of the negative team for this debate, i whole-heartedly support much more money to universities and research. %$* 277
let there be no doubt-- %$* 277
then if the gentleman with the green tie and blue-- %$* 13
our proposal for a new maginot line in cyberspace is moving ahead. %$* 277
gentleman with the green tie and blue shirt in the very middle. %$* 13
you'll never get him a microphone. %$* 480
this is will add 10 minutes to the debate. %$* 13
give him a microphone. %$* 13
do it the internet way. %$* 480
sorry. %$* 13
yay. %$* 480
nobody drink the beer. %$* 480
so i'm pleased to announce that the internet works. %$* 18
i really hope your question is excellent. %$* 13
otherwise the internet's failed. %$* 13
this question is for the team against the motion. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
schneier brought up recovery, and i think this is a key difference between real war and so-called cyber war. %$* 18
would you care to comment on the difficulties of the two compared to each other, recovery from a physical war and a cyber war? %$* 18
i guess that's for one of us. %$* 277
who did you-- %$* 13
i'll take a crack at it first, i suppose. %$* 277
first, note that our brethren in the affirmative set the bar at, does this create an existential threat to the country. %$* 277
that bar is too high, otherwise what happened in grenada i dare say was not a war, although i think grenada may have thought otherwise; or panama, or you name other conflicts that need not have existential dimensions. %$* 277
as i understand it, even the war of 1812, yeah, they burned down the white house, but, you know, they didn't actually threaten the entire integrity of our country. %$* 277
so we want to go short of existential threat. %$* 277
when i think of a war, what i think of is a hostile act designed to harm quite often, and typically physically, but not always, the interests, livelihood and, you know, day to day existence of the target. %$* 277
and that is most certainly possible in cyberspace. %$* 277
and when you see it happening because a 12-year-old can do it, it's like, yes, but it's not the chinese. %$* 277
it's like, well, that does not make me sleep any better at night. %$* 277
all right. %$* 13
i have to do a little thing for the radio and television at this point. %$* 13
it will be very brief. %$* 13
i want to remind you, we are in round two of this intelligence u.s.squared debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two. %$* 13
we're marc rotenberg and bruce schneier who are arguing for the motion, “the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.” and arguing against that motion, mike mcconnell and jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
oh, i mispronounce-- %$* 13
somebody in my ear-- %$* 13
the person who tells me everything to say. %$* 13
the nsa. %$* 277
has told-- %$* 13
i have to do it a second time. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
the voices in your head have a friends and family plan. %$* 480
there's always been a voice in my head. %$* 13
i slurred. %$* 13
we are in round two of this intelligence us squared debate. %$* 13
i am john donvan of abc news, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters. %$* 13
you said “debaters” right. %$* 480
i counted four. %$* 480
we are in round two of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i am john donvan of abc - - i have to do it without everybody laughing. %$* 13
we are in round two of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two who are debating this motion, "the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated." and we are going to questions from the audience. %$* 13
once again, ma'am, right there. %$* 13
you're the only woman in that zone. %$* 13
so stand up, and a microphone will come to you. %$* 13
i mean the only woman raising her hand. %$* 13
and we're actually seeing lots of men raise their hands, and we'd love to hear from some more women in fact. %$* 13
my question is to both teams. %$* 19
and we talked a lot about how this is in fact a policy debate. %$* 19
and i would like to know what policies, concrete policies, each side would propose come out of tonight's discussion. %$* 19
excellent question. %$* 478
so part of the argument on our side has been the need for openness. %$* 478
we believe that the most robust cyber security strategy is one that's based on openness and transparency. %$* 478
you know something? %$* 478
that's also been the key to the growth of the internet. %$* 478
we don't think there should be classified documents. %$* 478
we don't think there should be secret standards. %$* 478
we don't think there should be secret agreements between companies like google and the nsa over how to set cyber security standards for the users of services. %$* 478
just to take that step in this area, we think in the long term would provide great benefit for cyber security. %$* 478
mike mcconnell, who actually helped make policy. %$* 13
the nation typically responds to one of four things. %$* 479
fortunately, the most important is ballots. %$* 479
and even marc would agree there's no tampering with those. %$* 479
the second thing is crisis. %$* 479
there is a crisis, we react, sometimes in a dramatic way. %$* 479
the third thing is money. %$* 479
and the fourth thing is law. %$* 479
what i am arguing, or what i propose is we get the law correct. %$* 479
we don't want to wait for crisis. %$* 479
and when i made reference earlier to the debate in the late '40s and the early '50s, it was achieved in a way that i would agree with marc, openness. %$* 479
it was an open debate where we put the issues on the table, and we talked about it. %$* 479
and we got to the right place with the right strategy. %$* 479
that's when i'm advocating we recognize the vulnerability at a significant level where they would be attacked in war that could cause strategic damage to this country so that we elevate it and get the right policy embedded in law. %$* 479
your teammate, jonathan zittrain. %$* 13
first, let me express complete support and agreement for the fragrant smoke that marc just blew about openness and transparency. %$* 277
i'm completely in favor of that, too, so if you feel supportive of that, it doesn't mean you have to vote for that side because it's about the remedy, not about the problem. %$* 277
but you asked a great question about the remedy and let me give you a couple thoughts on that, that i think dovetail with openness and transparency. %$* 277
first, yes to chris' question from the front row; more money to universities and research arms that brought us the internet to begin with-- %$* 277
that's where the darpa money went, would be great, and more concretely-- %$* 277
i don't know if anybody remembers seti at home? %$* 277
this was one of these screensavers you could run instead of the flying toasters back in the day, and it would be crunching numbers from radio telescopes like that movie "contact," and at some point your computer might be, like, omg, "we have found extraterrestrial life." %$* 277
many people installed that and you ended up being able to do what otherwise would take a super computer by people volunteering cycles of their computer, offered over the network, aid among people with a common goal wanting to serve humanity. %$* 277
and i would love to see essentially what you might call "nato at home," which is a form of mutual aid in alerting, so if your computer is having issues there's a way it can alert nearby other computers that can learn to drive around that pothole it just hit. %$* 277
i'm part of a program called herdict, as in, verdict of the herd. %$* 277
i know the name is terrible, open to other ideas, but the basic plan is as you're surfing the net and you find you cannot get there from here for whatever reason, you're trying to get somewhere and it's not working, you can click a button and just report that, not even to the government, to likeminded people who can then get for the first time exactly the kind of dashboard that mike called for in his editorial so we know where the blocks are. %$* 277
these are concrete ideas in the spirit of mutual aid, and you don't have to-- %$* 277
jonathan, you’re rather going on. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
bruce schneier. %$* 13
so i actually disagree that openness is not a remedy. %$* 480
openness is a remedy. %$* 480
i mean, one of the problems we have in internet security is secrecy, that when you have secret systems, you don't know what the vulnerabilities are, you can't assess them, you can't make intelligent buying decisions and use decisions about what to choose. %$* 480
openness actually is a remedy. %$* 480
and it is a way to improve security. %$* 480
the best security protocols we have in the internet have been designed openly either by nis, by the government, in open process, by industry through the ietf, another open process. %$* 480
protocols that are developed in secret systems in secret tend not to work well. %$* 480
so basically i view security failures on the internet as market failures; that the incentives aren't aligned for whoever has the ability to secure to do it. %$* 480
and you can see that in identity theft, you can see that in viruses, that the people who can solve a problem don't have the incentive to do it. %$* 480
and when you have those problems and you have market failures, government has to step in and sort of set those right. %$* 480
so i actually agree with mike that the problem is government needs to get the policy right. %$* 480
we probably violently disagree on what that would look like, but that's what i want to see. %$* 480
i want to see the market fails that prevent these problems, whether they're the worms, the viruses, and all the servers attacks, the chinese hacking, from happening. %$* 480
i want to see those fixed. %$* 480
okay, i'll go to another question. %$* 13
i just for no particular reason want to go to a part of the room i haven't been to, there's a gentleman-- %$* 13
actually the gentleman who's sitting on the stairs, since you've been enduring that position, i think you've earned the right. %$* 13
did you say come up to the balcony? %$* 13
i’m on the balcony. %$* 18
do we have a microphone up there? %$* 13
we don't. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
we don't. %$* 13
do you want to come down? %$* 13
if one of you wants to come down, choose a representative-- %$* 13
we really don't need a microphone. %$* 18
no, we do for the broadcast. %$* 13
if you'd come on down, i promise-- %$* 13
but you're going to ask a very good question, right? %$* 13
come on down, seriously, and we'll ask a-- %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
so the proposition that we're being asked to vote on as the audience is that the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated. %$* 18
i'd like to know what each of you would say in response to the question, how do you measure that threat? %$* 18
how do you evaluate that threat? %$* 18

so try again. %$* 13
there is the mic. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is meitha and i'm a student at nyu.my question is sort of a clarifying question for both sides. %$* 19
you've been referring to religion and to the acts of religious people. %$* 19
i'm wondering if you see religion as a social organization versus religion as a personal individual instance of faith as distinct and having distinct effects, or do you see them as inseparable? %$* 19
and can i refine your question to take it more to our motion? %$* 13
and you tell me if this is fair. %$* 13
in a way, are you asking, should we get rid of the organizations and the churches and the synagogues and the panoply and the various kinds of hats that different faiths wear to establish themselves and to promulgate their rules? %$* 13
is that what you mean? %$* 13
essentially, yes, yes. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i want to ask the side arguing for a world without religion if that's what you're talking about. %$* 13
are you talking about-- %$* 13
yes, i think-- %$* 278
the organization. %$* 13
i think we were thinking about more or less organized collective practice of doctrine and morality. %$* 278
i mean, people do-- %$* 278
the thing about the word "religion" it's like sort of grandmother's underpants. %$* 278
you know, it's huge and baggy and saggy. %$* 278
it's got so many things in it. %$* 278
we talk about football, is this religion or tennis is our religion. %$* 278
and so our meaning is something that obsesses you and takes you over. %$* 278
the idea of one person believing that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden, and that that's person's religion is a bit of a stretch of the word. %$* 278
you want to look at the paradigm. %$* 278
and the paradigms are judaean and the christianity and islam and hinduism. %$* 278
all right. %$* 13
and they are collective practices. %$* 278
is there a religion without the organization, rabbi wolpe? %$* 13
david wolpe. %$* 13
no. %$* 279
okay. %$* 13
i mean, there is personal religious experience, but what we're talking about today is the social organization of religion and what religion does in the world, not so specifically what it does for individuals. %$* 279
so i would-- %$* 279
okay. %$* 13
sir, right down in the front row, plaid shirt. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
my name is mike. %$* 18
i-- %$* 18
approaching the holidays, and we're talking a lot about charity. %$* 18
and the argument you are making is that religion is very charitable. %$* 18
charities are often scrutinized because of their overhead. %$* 18
i've been to the vatican. %$* 18
and-- %$* 18
how do you reconcile the-- %$* 18
the obvious-- %$* 18
plunder. %$* 13
fluidity of funds that are being collected versus what is given out. %$* 18
and to be honest, if i-- %$* 18
= how would you convince me to give my money to you when i can give it to charities that are-- %$* 18
i'm not going to give it to the vatican, i promise. %$* 279
charities without as much overhead. %$* 18
but david wolpe, i think the question they're saying that religions can get very involved in earthly things and bog down in the-- %$* 13
or dinesh, do you want to take the question? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i think in the case of the vatican, the wealth of the vatican is in priceless treasures, tapestries, the ceiling of the sistine chapel, art. %$* 201
now, let's remember-- %$* 201
let's remember - - hold on a second. %$* 201
it's not the vatican's bank balance. %$* 201
it's the vatican's treasures. %$* 201
and let's remember that it was popes, the medici popes and so on, who commissioned those paintings. %$* 201
if it wasn't for catholicism, we wouldn't have the sistine chapel. %$* 201
not only that-- %$* 201
not only that, but in a study of achievement, the social scientist charles murray asked this question: why, at the top of the gothic cathedral are there gargoyles that have been detailed and carved in a way that no one can see them? %$* 201
and when the people who did those were asked why they were doing it when no one could see it, they said, we are carving for the eyes of god. %$* 201
the point being that transcendence introduces a new perspective. %$* 201
sub specie aeternitatis. %$* 201
the perspective of eternity. %$* 201
and so in a sense, your orientation is different, you act differently. %$* 201
and i'm not defending accumulations of wealth. %$* 201
i concede, religion, like any human institution is susceptible to corruption, a little bit like politics or anything else. %$* 201
but i'm saying on the balance, i think it would be wrong to think that we would be better off as a civilization as a culture, it's not all athens. %$* 201
all right. %$* 13
it's a combination of athens and jerusalem. %$* 201
let me take the other side on that question as a balance. %$* 13
anthony grayling. %$* 13
the church commissioned a lot of art because it had the money. %$* 278
and even artists have to eat. %$* 278
and we’ll notice that after the medieval period, the time when the great gothic cathedrals were built, soaring up to heaven with their wonderful spires and crockets, that was a time when people were taught that this life is short and nasty and brutish, and you've got to hang in there. %$* 278
and if you didn't sin too much, you might have a bit of a shorter time in purgatory. %$* 278
and the renaissance, the rediscovery of classical antiquity and its love of things human and things natural reintroduced not just devotional art but landscapes, picnics, portraits of ordinary people, paintings of still lives, a celebration of this world and all the joy and pleasure that there is to be had in this world, a humanistic perspective. %$* 278
was it not thomas hobbes who said life was nasty, brutish and short? %$* 279
it wasn't a religious. %$* 279
it was a philosopher. %$* 279
i was quoting him. %$* 278
yes. %$* 279
one more question, right in the center there. %$* 13
microphone will come in. %$* 13
all over the united states today as far as i can tell, we're seeing churches-- %$* 18
the organized religious institutions shutting down or closing down or contracting, in particular churches and synagogues, as far as i can see personally, in great numbers. %$* 18
does that bespeak, in your view, and in your view, a decline in the views of americans towards religion as something that they do not want in this country? %$* 18
so in other words, are americans beginning to vote with the other side more. %$* 13
should i take a poll? %$* 279
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
good one. %$* 13
the-- %$* 279
look, in-- %$* 279
david wolpe. %$* 13
in survey after survey after survey, americans still pronounce themselves overwhelmingly religious, overwhelmingly religious, 80 percent, 90 percent. %$* 279
it is certainly true. %$* 279
and by the way, and don't discount economic downturn because that also has a profound effect on religious institutions and other nonprofits as it does on the-- %$* 279
on the rest of the economy. %$* 279
i think that you find both trends at the same time. %$* 279
i think that this is a complicated-- %$* 279
you need balanchine to choreograph this. %$* 279
it's complicated. %$* 279
at the same time as people's religion is still high, their sense of religious affiliation and how they want to express their religion shifts very much. %$* 279
and so i don't think that you necessarily are seeing a decline in people's sense that there's something transcendent, something greater than themselves. %$* 279
but some organized religions, and not all, mormonism is growing, some evangelical groups are growing, some religions but not all are declining. %$* 279
pew reported that 10 percent of the american population is made up of former catholics, which i find astounding. %$* 13
that is astounding. %$* 279
always i-- %$* 13
are they jewish now, are they-- %$* 279
they have all that unbridled guilt running around in this society as well. %$* 13
maybe i should do the vatican-- %$* 279
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
well, i do think it's-- %$* 201
there was an expectation in the '60s and '70s that the world was becoming secular. %$* 201
europe was seen as being the automatic vanguard of this and the assumption was that as people become more affluent and educated they will automatically become more secular. %$* 201
it's turned out not to be the case. %$* 201
america has not gone the way of europe, and in fact if you look at any other culture, we're not seeing this automatic secularization. %$* 201
if you meet a hindu ph.d.and a hindu janitor they're just as likely to be religious. %$* 201
there's no difference. %$* 201
same in islam. %$* 201
so i think that it is the disproof of the secular assumption that has in a sense brought out this aggressive new atheism because the atheists thought they were winning anyway, they were winning by default. %$* 201
i think the european case is anomalous. %$* 201
it was not an attack on religion. %$* 201
it was an attack historically on an oppressive alliance between throne and altar. %$* 201
it was a political rebellion against a particular manifestation of religion in that society and the rest of the world is not going that way at all. %$* 201
matthew chapman, is there an advance of atheism or actually a bit of a retreat? %$* 13
i-- %$* 280
sadly i don't see much of an advance in atheism, and as for the churches emptying out, i think it's rather like the corner stores being taken over by walmart. %$* 280
you have the little churches and then you have the big mega-church. %$* 280
and you have churches now where 20,000 people go to pray, evangelical christian. %$* 280
so you know i'm sure there's some diminution of religious attendants but i don't see a huge surge of atheism unfortunately. %$* 280
okay, and anthony grayling. %$* 13
i think dinesh might be guilty of a tiny bit of wishful thinking there because the trend is towards more secularism. %$* 278
in fact, what's happened since 9/11 when the very violent religious activism brought religion back into everybody's point of focus again, is that the volume has gone up. %$* 278
people think that religion is resurging but actually it's because the volume has gone up in the debate. %$* 278
literally thousands, literally thousands of books of a religious nature are published every year in the united states of america and in britain. %$* 278
you don't have to walk into a barnes and noble to see shelf after shelf of them. %$* 278
about half a dozen books which are by dawkins and christopher hitchens and sam harris and daniel dennett, about half a dozen books have been published attacking religion and putting the atheist case, and all hell breaks loose. %$* 278
but by the way hell was sufficiently banned by the episcopalian church-- %$* 278
back in the 1920s. %$* 278
i don't know whether you know this but they're trying to reinvent themselves, but anyway it broke loose because half a dozen books had come out attacking the religious standpoint. %$* 278
and what had happened was this, before 9/11 religion went sort of by default. %$* 278
if i met a religious person, i would you know pussyfoot around, few eggshells. %$* 278
somebody once said, you meet a christian, it's like meeting somebody who's had a recent death in the family, which is a bit sort of apropos. %$* 278
so you wouldn't say anything-- %$* 278
and they probably at a dinner party wouldn't come out with their religious mission statements. %$* 278
anthony. %$* 13
but after 9/11 they did start to do it. %$* 278
the gloves have come off. %$* 278
the debate is now out in the open. %$* 278
and that's why it all sounds so noisy. %$* 278
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing remarks from each debater in turn. %$* 13
the closing remarks will be two minutes each. %$* 13
this is their last chance to change your minds. %$* 13
remember, after this we're going to ask you to vote again. %$* 13
and very quickly we'll have the results in a couple of minutes to declare our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is this, "the world would be better off without religion." here to speak against the motion in his closing remarks, david wolpe, rabbi of sinai temple in los angeles, california. %$* 13
i'm not going to read to you from the article in skeptic magazine that appeared in the most recent skeptic magazine which is as anti-religious a magazine as you can find saying that it is not possible to sustain that religion causes violence in the world, that, that is in fact not true and none of the statistics support it. %$* 279
but i do encourage you to take a look and read it and instead i'm going to end with a story. %$* 279
i'm a rabbi. %$* 279
so rabbi hugo gryn was a rabbi in england for many years but he and his father were in auschwitz when he was a child. %$* 279
and hanukkah came around. %$* 279
and his father took the precious margarine ration and instead of using it for food he used it to light the hanukkah candle. %$* 279
and his son protested and said how can you do this? %$* 279
don't you understand that this is food? %$* 279
and his father said to him, “listen, my child, we have learned that you can go three weeks without eating. %$* 279
you can go three days without drinking, but you cannot go three minutes without help.”now we’ve been accused of being too sophisticated to participate in this debate. %$* 279
right. %$* 279
real religious people are simple-minded. %$* 279
but i want to tell you that there are people all over this world, who, whether you think of them as simple-minded or not, the hope of their lives, the purpose of their lives, the good that they do is dependent not in fact on evolutionary pressures alone but on that candle, on the idea that god not threatens them, not is going to send them to hell, but that god created them in god’s own image, that they are precious, that they are sacred, and so are other human beings. %$* 279
and they wouldn’t live three minutes without that hope. %$* 279
and if you vote for the motion, then you’re suggesting that the world would be better if the hope were taken away from them. %$* 279
it isn’t, and you shouldn’t. %$* 279
thank you, david wolpe. %$* 13
motion is “the world would be better off without religion,” and here to speak in support of the motion, a.c. grayling, philosopher and author of “the good book: a humanist bible.” %$* 13
thank you. %$* 278
it seems very unkind to say that, but alas, it’s just basically true that the religious outlook on the world has its roots, its origins in the beliefs, the superstitions of illiterate goatherds who lived up to 3,000 years ago. %$* 278
and however much religion reinvents itself and however much it tries to make us forget its history and however much it obscures the fact that it depends upon proselytizing very small children for its survival, despite all that, we have an opportunity to think again and afresh and to recognize that in order to live with the kind of hope, with the kind of responsibility, with the kind of love for our neighbor, which is essential for a world of peace. %$* 278
we’ve got to do that hard work of choosing our morality, choosing our ethics, thinking about the principles of which we live, not borrowing it, not inheriting it, not having to conform to a set of doctrines about these things and a set of rituals which people very, very, very long time ago depended upon to do their thinking for them, but to think afresh, start again, and look at this world as a place where reason and human experience have to be our best, because they are in fact our only guides. %$* 278
thank you, a.c.grayling. %$* 13
our motion is “the world would be better off without religion.” and here to summarize his position against the motion, dinesh d’souza, president of the king’s college in new york. %$* 13
rabbi wolpe and i have been laboring under a tremendous disadvantage in this debate. %$* 201
both our opponents have a british accent. %$* 201
now, i was raised in india, and i come from a small part of india called goa, which was a portuguese colony for many years. %$* 201
and i’d always assumed that my christianity was the product quite honestly of the portuguese inquisition. %$* 201
the portuguese came to india with a sword in one hand and a bible in the other. %$* 201
and lots of people converted. %$* 201
they were extremely persuasive. %$* 201
so i’m very alert to the dangers of religion. %$* 201
on the other hand, i once asked my grandfather, a historian, about this. %$* 201
and he said that the fact of the matter was that tons of indians flung themselves into the arms of the missionaries. %$* 201
they wanted to convert. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
and my grandfather’s answer was that if you look at history, it was because of the ancestral-- %$* 201
not religious, but cultural caste system. %$* 201
most of the indians were relegated to the lower caste. %$* 201
and the fact of the matter is that if you were at the bottom, an untouchable, let’s say, there was no way to get out. %$* 201
there was no way to move up. %$* 201
no amount of merit could help you. %$* 201
and so, even though the missionaries might have been greedy and irredentist, the fact that they preached an idea of universal brotherhood, of love, of compassion, inspired people, ennobled their lives. %$* 201
and that’s why they became christians. %$* 201
a world without religion would in fact be a grimmer, harsher, meaner world. %$* 201
religion, for all its flaws, gives us a kinder and gentler world. %$* 201
and that’s why it’s better to have a world with religion in it. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 201
thank you, dinesh d’souza. %$* 13
our motion, “the world would be better off without religion,” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, matthew chapman, writer and co-founder of science debate. %$* 13
the world would be better off without religion because it is better off without religion. %$* 280
if religion made people behave better, markers of social dysfunction, drug addiction, ignorance, teen pregnancies, violent crime would be much lower in highly religious societies. %$* 280
in fact, the opposite is true. %$* 280
to quote my friend, austin dacey, "in post christian europe, entire nations have been plunked into endemic health, sky rocketing education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime." this was a disadvantage to the english. %$* 280
and i'm not-- %$* 280
i'm american. %$* 280
forgive me for using america by way of comparison. %$* 280
i am an american. %$* 280
i love america. %$* 280
however, 90 percent of americans believe in god. %$* 280
but we have by far the largest prison population on earth. %$* 280
drug addiction is widespread. %$* 280
gun violence is grotesque. %$* 280
our education system produces kids whose math and science skills are far lower than in secular countries while our rate of teen pregnancy is far higher. %$* 280
and in a country so rich and christian, it's amazing how many people live in abject poverty. %$* 280
religion is a rational, morally confusing and divisive. %$* 280
it still exposes young children to the ghastly concept of hell. %$* 280
it still denigrates women. %$* 280
it still fosters homophobia. %$* 280
and "religious" gave us 9/11.making no reference to god, science has, among many other things, rid us of the plagues, smallpox and polio, dramatically reduced infant mortality, doubled the average length of a burdened life and is coming to understand how the brain works, including its capacity for empathy and moral decision making. %$* 280
all this progress, all this beautiful knowledge, all this alleviation of human suffering in 100 years. %$* 280
religion has had thousands of years to prove its supernatural effectiveness. %$* 280
it hasn't. %$* 280
we think it's time to try a safer and more enlightened way. %$* 280
so i hope you will support our position that the world will be better off without religion. %$* 280
thank you, matthew chapman. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to decide-- %$* 13
to decide which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
let me just say that again so that it comes out. %$* 13
and now it's time to find out which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to again to go to the key pads at your seat and to vote on which argument you felt was better presented. %$* 13
push number one if you are with this team, the team that's arguing that "the world would be better off without religion," number two if you're with the team that argued against that proposition and number three if you remain or became undecided in the course of the debate. %$* 13
and we'll lock those in. %$* 13
ignore the other keys, and you can correct your vote, as i said earlier. %$* 13
and we'll have the results practically instantaneously. %$* 13
our producer, kris kamikawa, is backstage working on them and will bring them out to me. %$* 13
so before we move forward, i just want to thank-- %$* 13
i want to thank our debaters for the quality of our argument and the spirit of fairness that they brought to this. %$* 13
and i really feel that they might not have agreed with each other, but they heard etch other, and that's the essence of what we're trying to do here. %$* 13
so thank you for that. %$* 13
and i also want to say that the questions that we got tonight were some of the best we've ever had in a debate. %$* 13
the question from slate, from everybody here, even the gentleman with the question that i wanted to veto. %$* 13
the audience's veto of my veto was a good call. %$* 13
i think that went into a good-- %$* 13
a good place. %$* 13
so thank you to all of you for your participation and for the questions that you asked. %$* 13
so this concludes our fall season, but we're starting up again right after new year's. %$* 13
we start a new season of five debates from january through may. %$* 13
and we are setting them up now. %$* 13
and i just want to let you know what's coming up, what's booked so far, what's cast in iron at this point. %$* 13
on january 10th, the un should recognize a palestinian state, will be our motion. %$* 13
and our debaters will include, arguing for recognition, hanan ashwari who has long been a player in the story of the peace process. %$* 13
she was the first woman to be elected a member of the plo's executive committee, very frequent guest in the old days on "nightline." and we're very, very happy that she's coming in for that. %$* 13
and arguing on the other side, aaron david miller. %$* 13
he has served six secretaries of state on arab-israeli negotiations. %$* 13
and the rest of the slots on that debating panel are yet to be filled. %$* 13
on february 7th, our motion is going to be obesity is the government's business. %$* 13
and we have booked paul campos. %$* 13
he is the author of "the obesity myth." and he is trying to fight society's fear of body fat. %$* 13
march 13th, this motion we go internationally. %$* 13
and every season we do something from the east, or try to. %$* 13
and this time a focus on china. %$* 13
in an interesting way we think china does capitalism better than america. %$* 13
and our debaters in that include ian bremmer who is a founder of a global political risk consultancy. %$* 13
new york magazine says his career makes mozart look like an underachiever. %$* 13
and on april 17th, the motion will be "when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." we'll include jacob weisberg who is a pioneer in online publishing, chairman of the slate group, and our partner in this whole process, and eli pariser who is the former executive director of moveon.org. %$* 13
and may 8th, we booked this before the news caught up with it. %$* 13
but the motion on may 8th is "ban college football." our debaters will include buzz bissinger who is a writer and acclaimed author of friday night lights. %$* 13
and malcolm gladwell who has compared football to dog fighting and who is the author of blink. %$* 13
so our full lineup of debaters will be put together fairly soon. %$* 13
you can come to our facebook page. %$* 13
and if you join our facebook page, you'll have a discount on future tickets. %$* 13
we're also on twitter and on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
you can check the local listings for when it'll air on npr and wnyc here in new york. %$* 13
and we'll also be on public television, this particular debate as well. %$* 13
so again i want to thank you all. %$* 13
and we're-- %$* 13
we'll do a very-- %$* 13
a very brief countdown. %$* 13
i'm going to guess from 60 seconds or so to the-- %$* 13
even faster. %$* 13
thank you, kris. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so we have the final results. %$* 13
we asked you to vote before the debate and once again after the debate on where you stood on this motion and on what team you felt argued their position best. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers changed the most is our winner. %$* 13
the motion is this: "the world would be better off without religion." and here is the result. %$* 13
before the debate, 52 percent were in support of the motion. %$* 13
26 percent were against, and 22 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 59 percent support this motion. %$* 13
that's up 7 percent. %$* 13
31 percent are against it. %$* 13
that's up only 5 percent. %$* 13
and 10 percent are undecided. %$* 13
that's down 12 percent. %$* 13
that means the side arguing for the motion that "the world would be better off without religion" has carried this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you for me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

that was a courageous break from the mainstream of the democratic party %$* 127
i want to pay tribute to george, i’m doing my best to ruin all these people’s careers— %$* 127
that’s the conservative position against euthanasia— %$* 527
i’m doing my best to ruin all of their careers. %$* 127
look, we should not tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 127
three quick reasons, and a couple of them have been touched on but maybe not developed. %$* 127
george says, and i think everyone probably agrees that we have to be tougher in our diplomacy, think more seriously about sanctions, and move perhaps outside the security council to get sanctions if we can, explore financial pressure to really squeeze iran which i think the administration is beginning to do. %$* 127
secretary of the treasury paulsen is working pretty seriously on this, and that would be done i think outside the security council through a sort of coalition of the willing on the finance ministry side. %$* 127
this is all good. %$* 127
none of this will work unless it’s backed up by the threat of force. %$* 127
diplomacy will only work if there is a real threat of force, not just saying options are on the table, but a sense that we really won’t tolerate the outcome if iran does not yield, if the moderates to the degree there are some in the iranian regime, aren’t empowered by the pressure we’re putting on to prevent the headlong rush to nuclear weapons, and manage to change course domestically. %$* 127
diplomacy can’t work without the threat of force, therefore, it would really be disastrous to diplomacy to say, we must tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 127
so whatever people might think one would have to do, and sometimes one has to do things in the real world seven or 10 years from now or three years from now i suppose, we should not say we should tolerate a nuclear iran and therefore you should all vote “no,” just to help diplomacy along. %$* 127
but i’m serious about that, and i’m serious that i believe shouldn’t at the end of—i will satisfy karim and say that i would bomb iran in a pinch. %$* 127
but it is important to not even signal weakness. %$* 127
the only reason the europeans got serious in 2003 is that we went into iraq, that we hadn’t yet encountered the difficulties we’ve encountered in the subsequent three years, and iranians were worried and the europeans were worried that bush really would use force. %$* 127
that’s what made the europeans much tougher than it looked as if they would have been prior to 2003.so for diplomacy to work, you need the credible threat of force, you therefore could not say that we would tolerate, or certainly not that we must tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 127
so for diplomacy to work you need the threat of force. %$* 127
the credible, real threat of force. %$* 127
real plans, real attempt to lay the groundwork for it if it comes to that. %$* 127
secondly, deterrence. %$* 127
that is the ultimate argument obviously on the other side, we can deter iran, we deterred the soviet union, we deterred china. %$* 127
pakistan and india have nuclear weapons and so far at least haven’t used them. %$* 127
that depends on the nature of the regime. %$* 127
is this the brezhnev regime, so to speak? %$* 127
conservative, cautious old men, as george said? %$* 127
or is this a much more radical regime, or at least a regime with radical elements in it, and do we have confidence that the radical elements won’t prevail internally? %$* 127
i don’t think so. %$* 127
this is a rising, confident, ambitious, aggressive regime, that thinks it’s carrying forth a historic mission, sort of a jihadist mission on behalf of islam in general, particularly shia islam but perfectly willing to work with sunni jihadists and also to compete with sunni jihadists in radicalism which is itself very dangerous and of course that’s the story in some respects of the last 25 years in the middle east, with the wahabes and the iranians competing to radicalize islam and unfortunately, succeeding. %$* 127
letting iran progress towards nuclear weapons just increases the strength of all the worst radicalizing forces, the jihadist forces, within islam. %$* 127
it would be disastrous in my opinion not just for iran to get nuclear weapons. %$* 127
it’s disastrous for them to succeed in progressing towards nuclear weapons over the next two, four, six, eight years. %$* 127
every month that we huff and puff and the europeans huff and puff and we put off another security council resolution and they progress and ahmadinejad comes here and is treated well by the council of foreign relations and— two minutes. %$* 127
—and pays no price for anything he says or anything he does, every month and every year that that happens, the worst forces in the middle east are strengthened, every government that’s teetering and isn’t sure which side to join basically, our side, the moderate side or the radical side, decides they have to cut a deal with the radical side. %$* 127
individuals decide that looks like the way of the future, this is the classic, dangerous scenario. %$* 127
one hopes that the more moderate people, the more moderate forces in the iranian regime, are going to prevail, and the only way to help them to prevail, is not to reward ahmadinejad. %$* 127
that is what we are now doing by holding open the possibility that we would tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 127
it’s not just that it would be terrible if they got nuclear weapons. %$* 127
there, i think incidentally, it’s not just tolerating a nuclear iran, it’s tolerating a nuclear egypt and a nuclear saudi arabia, and then a whole bunch of nuclear countries which itself creates a very dangerous world. %$* 127
it is also the process of getting towards a nuclear iran, is itself extremely dangerous— one minute. %$* 127
i don’t like to use models from the ‘30s or the analogy of the ‘30s or hitler but in this respect it is like the ‘30s. %$* 127
hitler’s success at each stage strengthened him internally, he didn’t start out in firm control of the regime of which he was chancellor. %$* 127
there were others who thought he was reckless. %$* 127
every time he did something reckless and got away with it, it discredited his internal credits, it empowered fascists elsewhere in europe and other regimes began moving in that direction. %$* 127
the democracies became demoralized, we ended up fighting a war against a much more powerful fascist alliance-axis than would have been the case if we had acted much earlier. %$* 127
we face that prospect unfortunately if we let a jihadist radical regime successfully pursue nuclear weapons in the middle east today. %$* 127
thank you, william kristol. %$* 33
i’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 33
before the debate, you may recall you were asked whether you were for or against the motion or whether you don’t know. %$* 33
here’s the pre-debate tally, for which we will not need the u.s.supreme court to sort out the answer. %$* 33
58 votes for the motion, that we must tolerate a nuclear iran, 103 votes against the motion, and 58 don’t knows. %$* 33
so that was the vote before the debate. %$* 33
we’re now ready for the question-and- answer portion of the program. %$* 33
if you would like to put a question to our panelists please raise your hand. %$* 33
someone on either one of the aisles will find you with a microphone. %$* 33
i’ll call on you. %$* 33
as you’re asking the question, please stand up. %$* 33
if you’re a member of the working press and asking a question, please identify yourself. %$* 33
otherwise it’s your call, and i’m going to begin in the front row, with this young lady. %$* 33
hi. %$* 328
i’m not sure how much of it is a question, but i think it is. %$* 328
i’m on the “for” side, but i have to say the most compelling argument on the “con” is, not the prospect of iran having a nuclear weapon but the prospect of venezuela, egypt. %$* 328
so i feel strongly that yes, we must set a precedent, so that we don’t have 20, 30 nations with nuclear weapons. %$* 328
but then i wonder, how realistic is that? %$* 328
you look at the nations that are pursuing nuclear weapons, and these are nations that feel marginalized and threatened. %$* 328
it’s definitely i think a pursuit, both for protection and also for machismo or for popularity in their home. %$* 328
so is it really realistic to think that we are going to now have 10 more nations with nuclear weapons in the 10, 20 years? %$* 328
the kind of comment along with that too is there’s an interesting vicious cycle that’s set in place when, by starting another war you are creating this vicious cycle of other regimes feeling threatened, and then spurring them on to produce nuclear weapons. %$* 328
will we be giving chavez more of an impetus to get into the nuclear weapon battle? %$* 328
well, since the argument of the one-too-many nuclear irans was made by the opponents, may i ask the supporters of the motion, george perkovich, to answer it. %$* 33
does tolerating a nuclear iran imply tolerating many other new nuclear powers? %$* 33
well, i think we’ll come to this later. %$* 527
we’re now confused about what it means to tolerate or not to tolerate, because i happen to agree with everything patrick said because he didn’t talk about going to war. %$* 527
i agree with reuel and bill, we should do everything we can to try to prevent it. %$* 527
so if what we mean by “tolerating” is that we really, really don’t like it, we’re going to do everything we can to stop it, but we would accept living with it if that was the alternative other than war, then i think we agree. %$* 527
if the alternative really is what bill said, but not what patrick said, that not tolerating it means that you are willing to go to war over it, then i would say to your question, there’s only been one case in history where there was a military effort to stop a country from trying to get nuclear weapons. %$* 527
that was the israeli bombing of iraq in 1981.you can argue what the effects of that were in various ways. %$* 527
iraq went to war or was at war with iran, and then, we had another war with them in ’91 and then we had another war with them in 2003, and their nuclear program continued when we didn’t think it was from ’81 to ’91, but when we thought it was or some people thought it was, it turned out it wasn’t. %$* 527
we’re there now. %$* 527
every other case of getting a country to stop involved politics, negotiations, giving them benefits, security guarantees, trade-offs, and deals. %$* 527
so we should be concerned about if iran succeeds, what happens. %$* 527
but the way the rest of the world’s going to respond to this is going to be if you marshal diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, plus rewards. %$* 527
that’s the way to do it. %$* 527
reuel marc gerecht, why don’t you reply to what george perkovich is saying. %$* 33
i would just like to say that i’m very uncomfortable being in the majority if that poll is correct. %$* 410
i think the other side should demand a recount. %$* 410
but i mean, just a quick comment on that. %$* 410
i don’t think it’s any coincidence that gamal mubarak announced that egypt is going to have a civilian nuclear program. %$* 410
i think the timing of that, because of the iranian nuclear program, was intentional. %$* 410
i would add that there’s a great deal of suspicion that the saudis were in part financial backers of the pakistani nuclear program. %$* 410
it is impossible i think to overestimate the fierce hatred and competition that exists and has existed between saudi arabia and the islamic republic from 1979, bill alluded to it. %$* 410
much of the islamic militancy that we see today, the fuel behind bin ladinism, actually grew out of that competition in the 1980s. %$* 410
it would be surprising not to see the saudis make some play for a nuke. %$* 410
i would also add, i wouldn’t at all be surprised to see turkey go in a nuclear direction. %$* 410
i think the iraq war certainly showed to the turks they cannot rely upon nato as an institution of their defense, and i think the animosity that does exist in turkey, even if it goes in a more islamic direction which i think it will, will not diminish its profound suspicions of the islamic republic. %$* 410
i think it would be a good guess that the turks too would start working on a nuclear program. %$* 410
next question, do we have someone on that side? %$* 33
won’t you hand the microphone %$* 33
and then we’ll come over to the other side of the room next. %$* 33
could you stand up, please. %$* 33
eugene linden’s my name. %$* 531
given the present situation in iraq and afghanistan, and the possibility of $150-a-barrel oil, do we really have a credible military threat? %$* 531
you mean does, is the threat from the united states credible? %$* 33
patrick clawson. %$* 33
in a word, yes. %$* 528
first off, if the united states military were to take action iran’s nuclear sites, this would be the navy and the air force, which are not overly committed in afghanistan and iraq. %$* 528
it would be quite a doable thing to destroy the key nodes in iran’s nuclear program. %$* 528
we don’t have to flatten the whole thing, don’t have to go in and dresden and knock it all down. %$* 528
we just have to knock out the key nodes, and there are some key nodes without which that program cannot function, and it would take a number of years to rebuild. %$* 528
the question arises as to what iran’s response would be if we did this. %$* 528
well, we don’t know, it would depend upon the circumstances. %$* 528
but i would suggest that there was a time when in fact as far as the iranians are concerned, we did bomb them, and we did take military action against them. %$* 528
that’s the end of the iran-iraq war, when we after all, in what we see as a tragic accident, shot down an iranian airbus and killed 200-plus iranian civilians. %$* 528
but they saw that very bluntly as the united states entering the war. %$* 528
indeed, this being holy defense week, and the iranian newspapers have been full of interviews with people about the war and how it happened, and rafsanjani has asked, well why did you end the war? %$* 528
because america ended the war against us. %$* 528
so the fact is that the last time we bombed iran the result was within a week, that the iranians accepted a cease-fire, it stopped a war which had killed 700,000 people. %$* 528
we paid no price in our relationships with the iranians. %$* 528
that’s because the iranian people were sick and tired of that war. %$* 528
so the task is up to us to paint this nuclear weapon as the device which the mullahs are using to consolidate their power and their control and to keep their grip on the country. %$* 528
because if iranians perceive that what we are doing is getting rid of the tool by which the mullahs are going to consolidate their control, that’s a very different situation than if iranians think that this is a national bomb needed for national defense. %$* 528
i wanted to see if the other side agrees that there is a credible military threat, no ground troops, simply air strikes. %$* 33
karim. %$* 33
obviously the united states is powerful enough to bomb iran, that’s not the question. %$* 530
the question is the day after we bomb iran, just like the question in iraq should have been the day after we bomb iraq. %$* 530
obviously the united states could change probably every regime in the world apart from a few, china, russia, india. %$* 530
but what are the repercussions for the day after? %$* 530
i would argue that at the moment even the iranians believe that iranian soft power is dominating u.s.hard power in iraq. %$* 530
i would just put on the table that it’s fundamentally incompatible to think we’re going to stabilize iraq, while simultaneously dropping bombs on iran, not to mention other countries in the region. %$* 530
if we really want to try to tranquilize lebanon, we will see a resurgent hezbollah if we drop bombs on iran. %$* 530
we want to tranquilize palestine and strengthen the moderate palestinians we’re going to strengthen hamas, if we do that. %$* 530
i just want to make a further point that, bill and reuel have written that it’s unclear what would happen domestically within iran if we dropped bombs. %$* 530
maybe actually, we could over time strengthen the iranian moderates. %$* 530
this always reminds me of a quote from john limber, the great u.s. diplomat who was actually taken hostage in iran for 444 days during the 1979 revolution. %$* 530
he was someone like many iranians, my father included, who believed that when the shah was deposed, the shah’s government would be replaced by a secular democracy, and what we saw of course was that khomeini came to, to power. %$* 530
he later wrote in his memoirs that, that what he learned was that when sudden upheavals happen, revolutions are not won by those who can write incisive op-ed pieces. %$* 530
i think likewise in iran we should have no illusions that if we bomb the country it’s going to be moderates who come to the helm either within iran or within the region. %$* 530
sanam vakil? %$* 33
could i just add one more thing. %$* 529
if we also think about bombing iran, we also have to think about not just nuclear nationalism that persists within the country, but just inherent nationalism, the patriotism of iranians that they feel for their country, iranians who don’t even love the regime but love iran. %$* 529
the same way that you might love the united states of america or wherever you’re from. %$* 529
these are the iranians that will come out in defense of their country. %$* 529
there are many iranians i spoke with this summer, that said in the event of a military strike, they would come out in defense of their country and that’s something that we should consider. %$* 529
these are the people that fought an iran-iraq war, not for two years, not for four years, for eight long years. %$* 529
and that same way that you, your sons and your children would come out and defend the united states in the event of a military strike. %$* 529
reuel gerecht? %$* 33
yes, i don’t think anyone on this side of the table believes that bombing iran will produce a moderate revolution inside the country, and in fact i think we’d say that’s really not the issue at all. %$* 410
the issue is do you believe that an islamic republic armed with nuclear weapons is going to help the united states stabilize iraq. %$* 410
i think that is not at all true, just the opposite. %$* 410
as long as the radical forces inside of iran gain power and gain will, i think it is impossible to imagine a situation inside of iraq that is going to be stable and in any way pro-american. %$* 410
i think you will see the forces of radicalism inside the iraqi shia community, continue to gain ground, they’re becoming a dominant force in that society, and iran has no intention of deterring them. %$* 410
certainly an iran armed with nuclear weaponry, i don’t think would be a force of moderation inside iraqi politics. %$* 410
our next questioner? %$* 33
sir. %$* 33
i’m very sympathetic obviously to the “con” side. %$* 32
but i think one question has to be answered, which is: at this present time, what are you going to do about western europe. %$* 32
what are you going to do about the europeans in terms of their support or non-support for this kind of event, and the reality that in another two years we’re going to have another election. %$* 32
blair is on his way out, clearly the sense or spirit of accommodation is reflected i think in both the labour party and in the conservative party. %$* 32
so rather than just thinking in terms of next month, what is one’s answer to the question, how can we really threaten this unilaterally if we cannot bring any of the major powers in europe along with us. %$* 32
bill kristol, what’s the answer to that question. %$* 33
the only reason the major powers in europe are as engaged as they are diplomatically and at least talking, some of them, sometimes, about sanctions, on iran is that in fact they were worried in 2003 that we might use force. %$* 127
as the threat of force has receded, as we’ve been so reassuring in the last year and embraced diplomacy and made clear to the europeans that we put getting along with europeans i think unfortunately perhaps at a higher level of priority than actually dealing with the iranian nuclear program, they of course have cheerfully backed off. %$* 127
they’re not going to be ultimately extremely helpful in this. %$* 127
they will not privately shed any tears for the iranian nuclear program and i don’t think we’ll have any great rupture in nato, we’ll still have peacekeeping forces in afghanistan. %$* 127
but no, they will probably not be part of the mission, and they will in some ritualistic way, probably denounce it. %$* 127
but if a nuclear iran is really dangerous and i think it is, we can’t be stopped by the lowest common denominators of our allies. %$* 127
the unfortunate truth, i wish western europe were different, i wish all of europe were somewhat different, i wish they spent more on the military, i wish they were more serious about dealing with coming threats from outside their region. %$* 127
they’re not, and we have to take the lead. %$* 127
our next question, from the gentleman in the center. %$* 33
van greenfield. %$* 23
i voted against to start, i’m still there now. %$* 23
i think that when we recount again, if karim and sanam actually listen to their own words, then the people against will pick up two votes. %$* 23
i’m very serious about that. %$* 23
i think that sanam said that ahmadinejad dreams of becoming a war president. %$* 23
i fully agree with that, completely support that, i think that he believes it with his heart and soul. %$* 23
if he does feel that way, and has a nuclear weapon, we’re much worse off. %$* 23
karim’s comment was that iran getting a nuclear weapon would be disastrous. %$* 23
if it’s disastrous if they get it, and if he dreams of becoming a war president, i don’t see how you don’t vote that way. %$* 23
the question i’d like to ask is, as i sit here i was kind of astounded that we heard about virtually every country on the globe here, but the one country that we didn’t hear anything about, or any effect about, the country in a way most affected by the words that have been spoken, is israel. %$* 23
robert, you can choose who would answer it, but where do israel and our obligation to israel factor into this? %$* 23
i mean, they have to believe the words— %$* 23
—in the presentations, but first i should say that sanam and karim, you’ve been called upon to debate your own remarks. %$* 33
if there’s something you’d like to say first, feel free to. %$* 33
i stand by the statement that it would be a disaster if iran were acquire a nuclear weapon, but i would just say it would be far more disastrous to bomb them to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
these are the scales we’re forced to measure right now. %$* 530
i think bill and reuel and patrick would agree that as long as this government is in power in tehran, they will never feel comfortable that it’s somehow lost its nuclear ambitions. %$* 530
as long as this government is in power i think they’ll always feel that will happen. %$* 530
my point is that if we bomb iran, we’re going to prolong the life of this regime i would argue two, three, maybe four decades. %$* 530
that what’s going to happen is that these radicals are going to come to the helm, they’re going to clamp down on any type of moderates, and they’re going to have the pretext to do so. %$* 530
so if you want to preserve the shelf life of this regime then we bomb it, that’s my argument. %$* 530
sanam, does president ahmadinejad need u.s. provocation to become a war president or war leader, or will he become one on his own? %$* 33
oh, no, he’s begging the u.s.to do it. %$* 529
he’s not there just yet. %$* 529
i think you misinterpreted. %$* 529
he’s looking for the u.s.to bomb iran so he can avoid the economic mandate, his populistic mandate of why he was elected. %$* 529
he is not going to be able to fill the plates of 74 million iranians. %$* 529
and so foreign policy issues are a nice method of deflection for this president. %$* 529
bombing iran would propel this radical president to a higher post. %$* 529
the presidency of iran is never, historically and constitutionally, a strong position, and we’re making him stronger every day by paying attention to him. %$* 529
if we bomb the country, he will be propelled even more. %$* 529
we will be radicalizing the country in his favor even more, and he will be neglecting his economic mandate, and the fastest way to get him out of power will be to force him to focus on the economic issues that he was elected into office on. %$* 529
patrick clawson, to what degree is this about the threat perceived by israel from iran. %$* 33
well, first you’ll notice that the other side continually does not debate the proposition. %$* 528
they debate a very different proposition. %$* 528
the proposition they debate is we should not bomb iran. %$* 528
now if that were the question we were debating, it would be an interesting debate. %$* 528
but it’s not what we’re here to do tonight. %$* 528
the question is, do we tolerate iran’s nuclear program. %$* 528
that’s like saying, are we going to have the attitude towards an iranian nuke that we have towards an indian and a pakistani nuke. %$* 528
we tolerate that. %$* 528
we say, naughty-naughty, you shouldn’t have done that, but we tolerate it. %$* 528
the question is, are we going to have that kind of an attitude, or are we, as bill said, going to use instead the threat of force in order to back up diplomacy. %$* 528
bill didn’t call for bombs away, neither did i, and neither did reuel. %$* 528
what we called for is to have— %$* 528
i wouldn’t—let’s not go too far here. %$* 127
we have a diversity of views on this side too, you know. %$* 127
some of your teammates are on the record on this— %$* 33
there was a wonderful commentary article by ed lutfoch in which he said it’s not time to bomb iran, yet. %$* 528
it may come to be the time. %$* 528
but it’s not yet the time. %$* 528
because what we’re talking about is how we can use force in order to—the threat of force in order to back up that diplomacy. %$* 528
but george perkovich, you’re the pessimist about the diplomacy. %$* 33
you’re the one who’s saying it’s going to end up as an attack or not an attack. %$* 33
that’s in part because of the israel question. %$* 528
the answer is because israel evaluates the threat to it as much worse than the threat to us. %$* 528
then it’s quite possible that israel will decide that it’s got to attack iran well before we decide to attack iran. %$* 528
in fact i would say that that’s likely that israel will decide that it has to attack iran, long before we think we have to attack iran. %$* 528
that’s going to force the issue about what to do about this. %$* 528
well, it’s precisely because we don’t want to be in that situation that we have got to accelerate our efforts on the diplomacy, and we can use israel as that mad dog the threat of which we wave in front of the europeans in order to get them to be more serious about this matter. %$* 528
george perkovich. %$* 33
we don’t disagree with that, that we have to accelerate and toughen diplomacy, that we don’t want iran to have nukes, all of that we agree with. %$* 527
but what does it mean to not tolerate something? %$* 527
step up all those efforts. %$* 528
i agree, and then if those don’t fail, what does it mean not to talk. %$* 527
bill says it means go to war. %$* 527
reuel has said it means go to war. %$* 527
patrick hasn’t quite said that, so i’m not clear what the resolution is. %$* 527
we have a healthy diversity of views on our side, we don’t insist on orthodoxy unlike some people, you know. %$* 127
george, you’re saying, don’t tolerate it. %$* 528
you’re saying take action against it. %$* 528
well, this proposition is not, go to war with iran. %$* 528
that’s not the proposition we’re debating. %$* 528
may i make a point, a substantive point— %$* 127
but what you’re saying is pretend not to tolerate it. %$* 527
no, no, no, no. %$* 528
we shouldn’t tolerate it— %$* 528
and then maybe at some point you tolerate it, and bill says— %$* 527
no, no, we shouldn’t— %$* 528
this is a semantic debate— %$* 127
to clarify, patrick clawson, you’re saying, worst case, if all the diplomatic measures you’re talking about don’t succeed, then you’ll tolerate it. %$* 33
no. %$* 528
worst case, if the only way we can make the diplomatic measures succeed, as bill has said, is if we say at the end of the day if they don’t we’ll use force. %$* 528
because the only way we can make diplomacy work is if we say at the end of the day, we are prepared to use force. %$* 528
that is what we should be doing. %$* 528
but the other side has not said about—george says, we should press them, press them. %$* 528
how the heck are you going to press them, if you say at the end of the day that what we’re prepared to do, is tolerate it. %$* 528
they’re not going to be interested in being friends. %$* 528
can i say a word on this, this is just semantics. %$* 127
look, the serious argument and most respectable argument i would say on the other side is karim’s, that bombing would prolong the regime, would strengthen the regime. %$* 127
i take that argument very seriously. %$* 127
ahmadinejad successfully pursuing and acquiring nuclear weapons in my view would strengthen the regime and strengthen the radical elements in the regime, much more surely than bombing would. %$* 127
bombing is of course, you don’t know what effects. %$* 127
there’s empirical, historical evidence of the use of force destabilizing and discrediting a radical and aggressive regime, and there are historical examples of nationalist tempers flaring at least for a while, and the radicals being strengthened. %$* 127
i wouldn’t want to stipulate one or the other, but the one thing i think we can stipulate is that letting the most radical elements pursue nuclear weapons successfully would in fact strengthen the regime. %$* 127
so i think if you care about ending the regime which is what one has to care about, one has to be serious about saying we don’t tolerate this regime, this iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons, and then acting if necessary to prevent it. %$* 127
karim sadjadpour. %$* 33
i’d argue that at the end of the day what’s going to change this regime is economic malaise. %$* 530
it’s not going to be bombing it, it’s not going to be a nuclear issue, but similar to the soviet union, at the end of the day you can’t eat a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
that’s what’s going to change this government, but again i think that if we do give it a pretext to clamp down on its domestic population it will very much take it, and we could see the prospect of change moved back many years. %$* 530
i would just argue as well that if we somehow were able to manage a nuclear-armed soviet union and a nuclear-armed china, which had far greater appetite than iran did, it seems to me preposterous that we can’t tolerate a nuclear- armed iran in this context, in the context of deterrence. %$* 530
well, thank you both, thank you all very much for commenting on our audience’s questions, and for clarifying the semantics of the motion, or muddying the semantics of the motion, i’m not sure which. %$* 33
i’m intrigued by the idea that bill kristol came here undecided, and is newly won over to the “con” position. %$* 33
which would make him a neocon, finally. %$* 33
it’s now time to vote. %$* 33
you may think you’ve voted before but you’re going to vote again. %$* 33
this is the ticket you were given on the way in, and all of you should have one. %$* 33
if you don’t, don’t worry, an usher will provide you with one now. %$* 33
there are three possible votes you may cast with this. %$* 33
someone’s going to come by with a ballot box. %$* 33
if you’re for the resolution, take off the green “for,” it’s perforated, and drop that in the box. %$* 33
if you’re against, the red. %$* 33
if you’re still undecided, or if you are now undecided, drop the entire untorn ballot into the ballot box. %$* 33
as you do that, let’s make sure that the ballot boxes are making their way around the auditorium. %$* 33
in a moment, we shall hear brief concluding statements from our six panelists. %$* 33
what sort of progress are the ballot boxes making. %$* 33
good. %$* 33
good. %$* 33
we heard earlier from each of our panelists with an opening statement that began with those supporting the motion. %$* 33
we’re now going to hear brief concluding statements, of no more than two minutes each, beginning with those who are against. %$* 33
we start with patrick clawson. %$* 33
patrick? %$* 33
according to the new york times when kofi annan was in iran at the beginning of the month, he was quite astonished in his meeting with president ahmadinejad when president ahmadinejad explained that while britain and the united states won the last world war, iran was going to win the next one. %$* 528
now, kofi annan didn’t even realize there was going to be a next world war. %$* 528
much less, than iran intended to emerge victorious from it. %$* 528
do not underestimate the ambitions of a group which feels that they represent a quarter of the world, namely the world’s muslims. %$* 528
they feel, that they’ve brought down one superpower, the soviet union, thanks to the, the mujahadeen in afghanistan, and that indeed, they can bring down another. %$* 528
they have very extensive ambitions. %$* 528
so this issue of whether to allow them to have nuclear weapons, is of extraordinary import to us. %$* 528
that is why we should be prepared to make credible threats of the use of force. %$* 528
only through making credible threats of the use of force, is the kind of diplomacy that i described is going to be successful. %$* 528
if we begin that diplomatic process by saying at the end of the day, we are prepared to live with you, to tolerate this nuclear iran, we will get nowhere with that diplomacy. %$* 528
we will get nowhere with forging an international consensus for strong actions of the kind that we have been able to use successfully to slow down iran's program for the last 18 years. %$* 528
paradoxically only the credible threat of force is likely to prevent us from facing the danger of force. %$* 528
we have talked a lot about whether or not the united states will bomb iran. %$* 528
let us recognize, if iran gets the bomb, it may bomb us. %$* 528
thank you patrick clawson. %$* 33
george perkovich. %$* 33
again i'm confused by the terms. %$* 527
because we agree with almost everything especially that patrick said. %$* 527
and with much that reuel and bill said about its, the nature of the iranian government. %$* 527
what we want for the people of iran. %$* 527
how bad it would be if iran got nuclear weapons. %$* 527
and i don't understand what it means not to tolerate. %$* 527
because patrick has used the verb say. %$* 527
we should say we won't tolerate. %$* 527
he said we should have credible threat by using force but avoids the issue of would it be our policy actually go to war. %$* 527
which to me means not tolerate. %$* 527
bill's clear at least, he's saying yeah you know yeah we'll go to war. %$* 527
um that's what the resolution means on their side. %$* 527
not tolerate means physically stop. %$* 527
physically try to act against. %$* 527
and then the question is does that guarantee success? %$* 527
there is no guarantee of success. %$* 527
we found the trouble in iraq that was totally unanticipated. %$* 527
reasonable people would expect things to go badly in iran. %$* 527
so you can't guarantee – %$* 527
one minute. %$* 33
success. %$* 527
we have an experience with china. %$* 527
when china was getting nuclear weapons in 1964, the us government was prepared to launch nuclear war against it, to destroy china, to keep it from getting nuclear weapons. %$* 527
then we thought no, instead of that we'll give nuclear weapons to india in 1963.to balance china. %$* 527
we were afraid that mao was such a revolutionary. %$* 527
he had killed more than twenty million of his own people. %$* 527
something the iranian regime hasn't dreamed of. %$* 527
we thought it would be the end of civilization, that revolution would happen everywhere under this nuclear umbrella. %$* 527
well in fact we decided that we couldn’t stop china. %$* 527
china got nuclear weapons. %$* 527
here we are today. %$* 527
china is a huge economic threat to us today but it isn't like you're gonna go home tonight worrying that china's gonna wake up and nuke the united states. %$* 527
which it does have the capability to do. %$* 527
and which iran for the foreseeable future would have no capability to do. %$* 527
do i think we should publicly say we'll tolerate it and welcome it? %$* 527
absolutely not. %$* 527
but the exercise here is to try and clarify in your own mind, in your own plan - %$* 527
again i'm confused by the terms. %$* 527
because we agree with almost everything especially that patrick said. %$* 527
and with much that reuel and bill said about its, the nature of the iranian government. %$* 527
what we want for the people of iran. %$* 527
how bad it would be if iran got nuclear weapons. %$* 527
and i don't understand what it means not to tolerate. %$* 527
because patrick has used the verb say. %$* 527
we should say we won't tolerate. %$* 527
he said we should have credible threat by using force but avoids the issue of would it be our policy actually go to war. %$* 527
which to me means not tolerate. %$* 527
bill's clear at least, he's saying yeah you know yeah we'll go to war. %$* 527
um that's what the resolution means on their side. %$* 527
not tolerate means physically stop. %$* 527
physically try to act against. %$* 527
and then the question is does that guarantee success? %$* 527
there is no guarantee of success. %$* 527
we found the trouble in iraq that was totally unanticipated. %$* 527
reasonable people would expect things to go badly in iran. %$* 527
so you can't guarantee – %$* 527
on that note george we will remain just that clarified and no more. %$* 33
next concluding statement from reuel marc gerecht. %$* 33
well i remember having a conversation with a good friend of mine, jeffrey goldberg who now writes for the new yorker and used to write for the new york times magazine and jeffrey had just gone over to madrassas in pakistan and he was interviewing young students. %$* 410
and he kept asking them what do you believe in? %$* 410
and they kept saying to him, i believe in jihad, i believe in killing americans. %$* 410
and he'd go to the next one – i believe in jihad, i believe in killing americans. %$* 410
and he kept doing that you know day after day. %$* 410
and so he got some idea what they believed in. %$* 410
now the iranians don't ask that way all right. %$* 410
they're vastly more refined. %$* 410
that's what makes them in many ways the most, and also contradictory, that's what makes them i would argue the most interesting people in the middle east. %$* 410
but do not make a mistake, this question, this debate is about what is at the center of their spirit. %$* 410
and they are dedicated, they are dedicated to the jihad against the united states. %$* 410
they are the mothership of much of the islamic radicalism that we have seen and what is striking about the regime in tehran is that it hasn't become more moderate. %$* 410
it hasn't in fact gone into a period of thermidor. %$* 410
one minute. %$* 33
that the moderates that everybody has hope in and i have hope in them too, have been stuffed. %$* 410
and that you do not see them coming forward. %$* 410
you do not see them gaining power where it matters. %$* 410
it is great and wonderful that the average iranian on the street is in fact becoming much, much more moderate. %$* 410
it doesn't matter. %$* 410
what matters is the people at the top and they have not and i sincerely suggest that you do not want people like that who believe they represent god on earth and that they represent the vanguard for all muslims to have nuclear weapons. %$* 410
well i remember having a conversation with a good friend of mine, jeffrey goldberg who now writes for the new yorker and used to write for the new york times magazine and jeffrey had just gone over to madrassas in pakistan and he was interviewing young students. %$* 410
and he kept asking them what do you believe in? %$* 410
and they kept saying to him, i believe in jihad, i believe in killing americans. %$* 410
and he'd go to the next one – i believe in jihad, i believe in killing americans. %$* 410
and he kept doing that you know day after day. %$* 410
and so he got some idea what they believed in. %$* 410
now the iranians don't ask that way all right. %$* 410
they're vastly more refined. %$* 410
that's what makes them in many ways the most, and also contradictory, that's what makes them i would argue the most interesting people in the middle east. %$* 410
but do not make a mistake, this question, this debate is about what is at the center of their spirit. %$* 410
and they are dedicated, they are dedicated to the jihad against the united states. %$* 410
they are the mothership of much of the islamic radicalism that we have seen and what is striking about the regime in tehran is that it hasn't become more moderate. %$* 410
it hasn't in fact gone into a period of thermidor. %$* 410
thank you reuel marc gerecht. %$* 33
now to one of the most interesting people in the middle east, now to sanam vakil. %$* 33
i appreciate reuel's comments that the government of iran is the vanguard of leading this one fourth of, and patrick's, one fourth of the world into jihad. %$* 529
but that's not the government that i'm aware of and that i have been studying. %$* 529
perhaps two different countries that we've been working on. %$* 529
and my interviews that i recently conducted in tehran, many people in the variety of camps of the regime, ahmadinejad's ministry as well, told me repeatedly that it's the constant threat from abroad, regime change threats from the us administration that have been coming from the past four years. %$* 529
threats of sanctions, containment, isolation of this regime that are perpetuating these fears within the iranian regime. %$* 529
so consider that when thinking the iranian mentality. %$* 529
there are two ways of going forward. %$* 529
we have the military option. %$* 529
but we have an option that has never been actually pursued. %$* 529
twenty seven years of isolation, there's a wide gulf. %$* 529
why not actually try direct engagement with these crazy folks? %$* 529
and let's see actually what they might do. %$* 529
if we're actually dealing with them one on one bring them close. %$* 529
make your enemies our friends. %$* 529
we can monitor their nuclear program and often times there's a lot of talk on the iranian street that the hope of having america back in iran will actually stimulate the iranian people and recharge them and that might be the way to perhaps lead to a prosperous and maybe even hopeful iran in the future. %$* 529
thank you sanam vakil. %$* 33
and now i will hear from bill kristol. %$* 33
really just three points. %$* 127
proliferation, terror and jihad. %$* 127
the proliferation threat is unlike that of when the soviet union or china acquired nuclear weapons. %$* 127
it's not just a generic venezuela, brazil, south africa, etc threat. %$* 127
nigeria – that is a real issue too. %$* 127
but it is an absolute i mean it is very likely that turkey, egypt, saudi arabia, algeria would decide they would want nuclear weapons if iran had them. %$* 127
i don't know if we could stop them, we could offer them security guarantees, if people feel comfortable living in a world where we're providing security guarantees against a nuclear iran for a wahabi saudi arabia. %$* 127
i suppose we can try to manage that world. %$* 127
it would be safer i think to prevent iran from becoming nuclear in the first place. %$* 127
we are talking about an extremely dangerous arms race in the most volatile region in the world. %$* 127
that was not the case when previous nations went nuclear. %$* 127
india, pakistan a little bit more like that. %$* 127
and pakistan was the worst one to have allowed to have gone nuclear but now this is pakistan squared. %$* 127
so to speak. %$* 127
cubed or something. %$* 127
second, terror, providing a nuclear umbrella for terror is not something that's been done. %$* 127
the soviet union played with terror and did some pretty bad, funded some pretty bad things but nothing like the intimate relation to terror that the islamic republic of iran has had. %$* 127
and people need to think seriously about what a nuclear umbrella over terror acts with the possibility of giving nuclear weapons to terror groups but also protecting terror groups by a threat of nuclear retaliation. %$* 127
what that does in the middle east, here israel i think becomes a central question and how does that, how does israel then react to terror groups, protected so to say by iranian nuclear threat of retaliation. %$* 127
finally, jihad, patrick and reuel have made this point right. %$* 127
this regime, getting nuclear weapons would be the biggest booster shot for jihad and i think both on the shia and sunni side is possible. %$* 127
that is the threat. %$* 127
the jihadists need to, those on the wavering need to be convinced that jihadists are losing – letting this regime get nuclear weapons would convince too many people unfortunately that they're winning. %$* 127
thank you bill kristol. %$* 33
and lastly karim sadjadpour. %$* 33
i think one thing that's been missing tonight is iran's ambitions. %$* 530
iran's impetus. %$* 530
we talked a lot about what the us is thinking, what israel is thinking but we can't look at iran's ambitions in a vacuum. %$* 530
and if i would make the argument that as a – it's not that they want to pursue nuclear weapons to wipe israel off the map. %$* 530
we tried to get inside the head of iranian leaders they say well this revolution of ours happened twenty seven years ago and to this day the us has never recognized us. %$* 530
and look historically at countries that have pursued nuclear weapons. %$* 530
not been for offensive purposes. %$* 530
has been very much driven by senses of insecurity and defensive purposes. %$* 530
i would just invoke the paradigm which many in the right in the us have invoked when it comes to iran. %$* 530
and that is one of two ticking clocks. %$* 530
so there's the regime change clock and there's the nuclear clock. %$* 530
and the idea is that you have to make the regime change clock in tehran expire faster than the nuclear talk so when the day comes when iran actually weaponizes, it will be under more friendly, democratic iranian regime. %$* 530
now the fundamental contradiction of this policy is that when you try to expedite the regime change clock in tehran you send the message to iranian leaders that in fact the united states is after nuclear, is after regime change approach. %$* 530
and therefore you need to pursue a nuclear deterrent. %$* 530
so we have to get these clocks worked up. %$* 530
is the option, is the goal to prevent iran from going nuclear or is it to change the regime? %$* 530
if we continue to try to do both, that's going to be iran's greatest impetus for pursuing a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
thank you karim sadjadpour. %$* 33
and thank you to all six panelists for your very ardent contributions. %$* 33
it's now time to announce the results of the audience voting and after our debaters did their best to sway you, you voted eighty two for the motion that we must tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 33
one hundred sixteen against. %$* 33
and twenty one remain undecided or don't know how they would answer that. %$* 33
so congratulations to the opponents of the motion for their winning the debate here this evening. %$* 33
and to the proposer, and to the proposer and his team for increasing his tally so much after the debate. %$* 33
i'd just like to invite all of you to return in three weeks for the next intelligence squared us debate. %$* 33
wednesday, october 18th, it's here at asia society and museum and the motion to be debated on that day is freedom of expression must include the license to offend. %$* 33
and the panelists will include such folks as philip gourevitch and christopher hitchens. %$* 33
i'll let you try to figure out which side of the offending question hitchens is going to be on. %$* 33
an edited version of tonight's intelligence squared us debate can be heard locally on wnyc am 820 on friday, october 6th at 2 pm.outside of new york city you'll have to check your local npr member station listings for the date and time of broadcast there. %$* 33

at school at least they should be helped in developing lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition. %$* 414
i want to go to another question, but i want to tell folks who are in the darker area that i can't see you and the same is true on the sides, so if you want to ask a question you might take a stroll down toward the front. %$* 13
in the-- %$* 13
i'm pointing-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah. %$* 13
hi, i'm chandra turner we've talked a lot about healthy lifestyle, but what i want to know is what is the government's role beyond just promoting this healthy lifestyle that we've all kind of anecdotally realized that isn't working, what about the government's role in junk food in schools? %$* 420
what about the government's role-- %$* 420
in taxing foods? %$* 420
okay. %$* 13
what about the government's role in-- %$* 420
what's the other thing-- %$* 420
labeling products? %$* 13
the fast food industry-- %$* 420
yeah. %$* 13
the packaged food industry, the-- %$* 420
all of the junk that our kids are getting constantly? %$* 420
what is the role there? %$* 420
we haven't talked about that at all. %$* 420
can i ask you a specific-- %$* 13
suggest-- %$* 13
i mean, a specific recommendation you would want to see, for example, with junk food, would you want to ban it? %$* 13
would you want to label it? %$* 13
would you want to tax it? %$* 13
would you want to change the formulation? %$* 13
forced by the government? %$* 13
which of those things are you talking about? %$* 13
kind of all of the above. %$* 420
okay, i want to-- %$* 13
i want to ask-- %$* 13
seriously-- %$* 420
john stossel, you're going to get your chance. %$* 13
i mean, i-- %$* 420
when i think about the role of government, that's what i want to know, all the things that haven't been done yet. %$* 420
yeah, okay. %$* 13
what can be done, and what is the government's role in that? %$* 420
david satcher. %$* 13
yeah, i think it's an excellent question. %$* 414
the government's role can be put into three categories. %$* 414
one is this assessment where you really monitor the health of the population, and you give us this kind of information that we can act on. %$* 414
the second one is assurance that everybody has access to the opportunity to lead healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
the third one is policy. %$* 414
and you're right, it is the responsibility of government to develop guidelines for healthy eating. %$* 414
the nutrition act that's just passed is an effort to say, "if we're going to have free breakfast, free lunch in the schools for 40 to 50 percent of the children, we must make sure that those lunches are healthy, that they have adequate fruits and vegetables," i agree with you. %$* 414
the third role of government is policy development, and that policy is made in such a way as to make sure, number one, we have the information that we need, we’ve got to have labels on the foods so we know what we're getting, and also you've got to make sure the children who are receiving these lunches are getting healthy foods. %$* 414
okay-- %$* 13
that is the role of government. %$* 414
i want to let the other side respond to that, but i want to take a quick break-- %$* 13
artificial break for radio-- %$* 13
which will take all of eight seconds. %$* 13
and then i'm going to raise my hand and ask you to applaud. %$* 13
and that'll be the atmospheric moment in the radio broadcast and it'll be chance for all of your hands to be heard by the nation. %$* 13
so if you could do that, i'd appreciate it, just a round of applause. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we are back at this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
our motion is "obesity is the government's business." we have heard the side arguing for the motion just recently make the case the government does have a very activist role to play in affecting and amending what people eat, in particularly, children. %$* 13
i want to let the other side respond to that argument. %$* 13
john stossel. %$* 13
dr. %$* 288
satcher, i think you're confusing intention with results. %$* 288
it's nice that we have this good intention, but government doesn't get the results. %$* 288
some schools now have banned vending machines. %$* 288
a university of pennsylvania study-- %$* 288
banned vending machines that sell unhealthy food. %$* 288
they studied it. %$* 288
they found the kids eat just as much junk food, no difference in weight loss. %$* 288
you earlier said that, you know, the schools are supposed to be the great equalizer. %$* 288
they are supposed to be, but government schools are more segregated than private schools. %$* 288
it doesn’t work. %$* 288
government fails. %$* 288
david satcher. %$* 13
well, well, i don’t agree that governments fail. %$* 414
now, the study that you’re talking about, i don’t think anyone, even the ones who carried it out would see that as a conclusive study. %$* 414
what they said was to date, we don’t see the evidence that changing the vending machines-- %$* 414
we’re going to keep doing more of it. %$* 18
we are going to keep working to help children develop lifetime habits of good nutrition and physical activity. %$* 414
i think that’s our responsibility. %$* 414
and that’s what the schools have to do. %$* 414
paul campos, arguing against the motion. %$* 13
there-- %$* 416
i mean, i think there’s a major misunderstanding here about the way that society works in regard to the things that people eat and how many calories they have. %$* 416
i mean, i’ve just spent the last three days on the upper west side of new york, and i’m surrounded by nothing but the most incredibly high caloric food that you can imagine, which, thanks to the neuroses of your mayor, are now made evident to me every time that i walk into a store because it says right there how many calories there are. %$* 416
and so i go into this place where it’s filled 100 percent by upper class white people looking at these little cupcakes that have 545 calories in them, so it’s like a nuclear bomb of calories, right. %$* 416
but is that going to cause obesity in that group? %$* 416
no. %$* 416
guess why? %$* 416
because they’re going to, you know, buy it and then slice it into eight little pieces and then eat it in a super neurotic way and then go to the yoga studio for two hours, right. %$* 416
now, the notion that that kind of a social structure can be altered through these kinds of informational government interventions is just-- %$* 416
again, there’s no data to back it up. %$* 416
now, i understand the theory that if something hasn’t worked, you can keep doing it until it does work, right. %$* 416
that-- %$* 416
one of the classic, you know, definitions of insanity, but that seems to be the government program here. %$* 416
again, do you think-- %$* 416
all right, let’s let pamel-- %$* 13
let’s let pamela peeke-- %$* 13
oh, david satcher. %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
it’s amazing that the same thing was said about tobacco, the effort to get people to stop smoking, you know. %$* 414
go back to the ’60s and the ‘70s. %$* 414
it’s not working. %$* 414
there’s no evidence. %$* 414
to date, we can point to millions and millions of peoples whose lives have been saved because of the efforts to get people to quit smoking. %$* 414
smoking is a behavior. %$* 416
obesity is not a behavior. %$* 416
you’re wrong, wrong, absolutely wrong. %$* 415
oh, absolutely wrong? %$* 416
is that why-- %$* 416
tell me, pam. %$* 416
tell me, pam, why are people fat? %$* 416
why are people fat? %$* 416
was it magic? %$* 415
it was behavior. %$* 415
because i’m a upper-class white person who has the privilege of modifying my weight to an extent that most people don’t. %$* 416
and you cut your cupcake into 13 pieces. %$* 415
except, you know, right now, pam, i weight about 185 pounds, which is supposed to be rather high in the overweight range. %$* 416
so, apparently, i might drop dead right on the stage right now because according to dr. %$* 416
walter willett, that-- %$* 416
to be overweight is very, very dangerous. %$* 416
if that doesn’t happen, i suggest that people think about the possibilities that are actually available to people in this culture. %$* 416
and i would especially want to emphasize that if you think that the biggest problem that poor kids have in this country right now is that they don’t get enough information about how much calories is in the junk food they eat or they don’t have enough play spaces to play outside, you’ve got a really bad conceptualization of what actually-- %$* 416
you’re off-topic, paul. %$* 415
all right, there’s a gentleman-- %$* 13
the gentleman in the far corner. %$* 13
thanks, if you could stand up. %$* 13
hi, my name is darrell baxter and my question is for the panelists for the motion, mr. %$* 421
stossell pointed out earlier that the government does get involved in certain programs such as subsidizing the corn subsidies. %$* 421
and also, dr. %$* 421
satcher pointed out earlier with the nutrition program, and i recall reading the article where there was an exception in the nutrition program where i think it was pizza and tomato sauce are considered vegetables. %$* 421
so, my question is to the extent government actually got out of the business of causing obesity through subsidies and so forth, what impact would that have on affecting dietary consumption? %$* 421
david satcher. %$* 13
it’s a great point and a great question. %$* 414
and i think that’s exactly what’s happening. %$* 414
i think government is beginning to change the way we spend our money relative to foods, with children especially. %$* 414
look at the new nutrition act and the difference that it represents from what we’ve seen in the past in terms of the way children eat in school. %$* 414
so i think we are-- %$* 414
the government is responding to the studies that we’ve been talking about, showing how these foods are affecting lifestyles and therefore resulting in ill health, especially type ii diabetes, even in children. %$* 414
so, you’re right, we, the government, have been at fault in many ways in terms of what’s going on in this country, in terms of subsidies as you pointed out. %$* 414
and hopefully we are making the changes that we need to make. %$* 414
it is the role of government to continue to learn and to grow and to change. %$* 414
and that's what we're seeing now. %$* 414
sir, in the-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
my name is larry parks. %$* 422
i host the larry parks show on cable access. %$* 422
and about a year ago i did a show, “are they poisoning you? %$* 422
” where i addressed these issues. %$* 422
and the question i'd like you to address is, how do you know if you get the government involved in this that it won't become politicized. %$* 422
in the show, i say, are you being poisoned, really attacked the food pyramid which was-- %$* 422
came out of government and walter willet who both sides have mentioned, the folks you'd know he's a medical doctor, heads the nutrition department at harvard university. %$* 422
he wrote me that they get their people, the food industry gets their people on the committees to make the recommendations. %$* 422
so dr. %$* 422
satcher, you say you want healthy foods. %$* 422
how do you know all this won't be politicized? %$* 422
and the recommendations, rather than being consistent with good health, or rather consistent with profits of food companies? %$* 422
this is a great question. %$* 414
and to be honest with you, i don't know, since everything becomes politicized. %$* 414
you know-- %$* 414
you bet. %$* 18
as surgeon general, what i said was that i'm not a politician. %$* 414
i speak to the american people based on the best available public health science. %$* 414
but believe me, there were a lot of political pressures on me every time i did a report. %$* 414
but the fact of the matter is, the surgeon general's report is based on the best available public health science. %$* 414
it has to be approved by the nih.it has to be approved by the cdc.it has to be approved by hhs.so government is imperfect. %$* 414
and it's up to us to continue to make it more perfect, a more perfect union. %$* 414
but it's up to us to continue to push the government-- %$* 414
paul campos. %$* 13
i think it's really important to keep in mind that scientists are people just like everybody else and that science is a deeply politicized activity because it can't avoid being politicized given that it's about power and social policy and all the things that are political all the way down. %$* 416
i think when we look at the food industry, one thing that people ought to keep in mind is that the food industry loves the obsession that americans have with weight. %$* 416
the food industry makes enormous profits from selling people food that is supposed to make them thinner, right? %$* 416
the diet foods have a significantly higher profit margin than regular foods because diet foods can be sold as a kind of magical elixir that's going to cause this weight loss if you buy something, which it doesn't have something in it that it's supposed to have in it, but which is supposedly then-- %$* 416
which has a substitute of something else. %$* 416
so for instance, a fat-free fig newton has more calories in it than a regular fig newton. %$* 416
because the sugar that's substituting for the fat in the fat-free fig newton is more caloric. %$* 416
but the fat-free fig newton will cost more. %$* 416
so the food industry loves all this stuff, loves the fact that we're obsessing on these issues and trying to supposedly find a magic cure for our supposed obesity epidemic because that's one of the main sources of its profit margins. %$* 416
and so it encourages this kind of social hysteria. %$* 416
okay. %$* 13
right here in the-- %$* 13
well, the way to get the price down is to make more of it, right? %$* 414
isn't that what happens with-- %$* 414
happened with computers and everything? %$* 414
so in time, we ought to be able to get the price of fig newtons down. %$* 414
thank you. %$* 13
well, blue sweater. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
hi. %$* 423
my name is sandy schaefer, i'm a plus-sized aerobics instructor. %$* 423
and i just wanted to make one statement that-- %$* 423
but very brief, okay? %$* 13
yes, very-- %$* 423
very brief. %$* 423
you get a sentence. %$* 13
all right. %$* 423
okay. %$* 13
as the word "obesity" is ramped up, so is the bullying of fat children. %$* 423
so my question to you is even though you say you're talking about fit, you still have the word "obese," and you're still targeting children and fat children specifically. %$* 423
and they're now being bullied more and more, and it seems to be with government approval. %$* 423
so how do you speak to that? %$* 423
okay, i'm going to pass on your question. %$* 13
i'm going to let that stand as a-- %$* 13
as a darn good statement. %$* 13
just over on the corner up there with the-- %$* 13
you have the white card in your hand. %$* 13
you still need to let the mic come to you. %$* 13
thought this would be loud enough-- %$* 19
no, the radio won't pick you up. %$* 13
that's the problem. %$* 13
in a public school where 95 percent of students receive government assistance, whether we call wic or welfare, essentially it's free lunch. %$* 19
the lunchroom has machines filled with overpriced doritos, chocolate chip cookies, cheetos, et cetera, which many of the students purchase, often in lieu of their available free lunch that was paid for by my tax dollars. %$* 19
is there data regarding specifically the percent of urban welfare recipients how they spend their money and where they spend their money on food? %$* 19
what are you getting-- %$* 13
what do you want to get at though? %$* 13
you want to say that there is an absence of data to know whether it's working? %$* 13
i think she's suggesting it's not working, that they have a free lunch, but they spend $4 on the vending machine junk. %$* 288
you can't manipulate people as well as we think you can. %$* 288
actually, there's a-- %$* 415
there is a fantastic study that just came out in the journal of sociology. %$* 415
and it basically showed that when you have all of this at school, and you have another option, many of these kids are going to what they're used to at home. %$* 415
and so what they're not going to do is, you know, come from a home where they're eating trash and drinking trash and back and forth, and then suddenly magically come to school and go, wow, asparagus, bring it on. %$* 415
they're just not going to do this. %$* 415
what you're talking about is a reward system in the brain that's been hijacked. %$* 415
and you're looking at consistent behaviors on the part of these children. %$* 415
this is one of the reasons why-- %$* 415
but pamela, let me bring it back to our motion. %$* 13
so what's the government's role in this? %$* 13
well, the government's role in this, you know, is a bit more complex. %$* 415
you're looking at a child and controlling that child and offering options there. %$* 415
but you haven't talked to the parents. %$* 415
what we need to do now is bring in the family. %$* 415
if you don't have the family as a unit in this, then this is going nowhere fast. %$* 415
and the government-- %$* 414
am i not looking at a child to receive tax-- %$* 19
whose family receives tax funds-- %$* 19
sorry, tax- generated funds and brought their money to school and spent it on a machine instead of on their healthy lunch? %$* 19
and by the way, 25 out of 28 students in my class, which is 95 percent free lunch, have cable tv. i don't have a tv. %$* 19
paul campos. %$* 13
yeah, but what you're talking about is-- %$* 415
they may have the money. %$* 415
they haven't made the connection. %$* 415
look-- %$* 416
paul campos. %$* 13
again, this has been studied. %$* 416
there have been intense government intervention such as, for instance, the pathway study was based on the notion we're going to educate the kids, we're going to educate the parents about healthy eating habits and better physical activity. %$* 416
we're going to do all these wonderful things that the government is advocating that we do. %$* 416
and what those things did was that they produced some improvement in terms of lifestyle modification, but they did not produce weight loss. %$* 416
there is no evidence that telling parents of children, of fatter children, that this kind of food is-- %$* 416
has more calories in it, and this has less and this is more nutrient rich, and that is less or whatever, is going to produce thinner children. %$* 416
and i want to get back to sandy schaefer's point because i think it is an absolutely crucial one. %$* 416
right now, what we are creating is a machine essentially for stigmatization and bullying, right, because the government is just broadcasting this message 24/7, that if you're a fat kid, you have something wrong with you, and you have something wrong with you that happens to be your fault because you could modify it. %$* 416
paul, that's not just the government. %$* 415
no, no, no, no. %$* 415
we're talking about the media. %$* 415
bring it on through the media. %$* 415
you look at those magazines. %$* 415
you look as those shows. %$* 415
you look at the fantasy world everyone lives in. %$* 415
that was going on a hell of a lot longer before any government intervention showed up. %$* 415
right. %$* 416
but now you're exacerbating it. %$* 416
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i have time. %$* 13
i have time for one more question. %$* 13
i thought sandy did it really when she said it the first time. %$* 13
in the aisle, since you came all the way down, sir. %$* 13
can you step forward just a little bit? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
a little bit more. %$* 13
that's great. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
my name is sakon sharob if we take a step back from the debate and look at the economics of it, maybe the government side could tell us why, out of all actors, government itself is the best actor to step in and solve this problem, if there's a problem in the first place? %$* 424
dr.-- %$* 424
okay. %$* 13
let's take that question quickly. %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
why the government? %$* 13
i think the government is the only actor. %$* 414
remember who the government is. %$* 414
public health is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy. %$* 414
government calls upon all of us to work together to solve the problem. %$* 414
it does it through public-private partnerships. %$* 414
so it's not either/or. %$* 414
we're not saying the government does this, and nobody else. %$* 414
we need all hands in. %$* 414
but if the government does not do its job, it will not get done because government has the resources, and nobody else does, to monitor the health of the population. %$* 414
government has the resources to make policies so that we can have an idea what people are eating and what they are exposed to in terms of information. %$* 414
very quickly. %$* 13
so i think the government has a role that only the government can play. %$* 414
but it doesn't mean nobody else does. %$* 414
very quickly, paul campos. %$* 13
yeah, i'd like to point out something. %$* 416
the health of the american population is better now than it's ever been before. %$* 416
i mean, all this talk of like a huge health crisis overlooks the fact that in fact not only is the life expectancy the highest it's ever been and continuing to increase at a steady rate, but all-- %$* 416
the rates of almost all the major diseases are significantly lower than they've been before. %$* 416
life expectancy may be up. %$* 415
health span is down. %$* 415
the quality of life is decreasing significantly. %$* 415
yeah, because people who are 90 are not very healthy. %$* 416
we're keeping people alive who are grossly disabled by these diseases. %$* 415
all right. %$* 13
all right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's-- %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater, in turn. %$* 13
their closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember we had you vote before the debate. %$* 13
immediately after these closing statements, which are their last chance to win this thing, we are going to ask you to vote again, and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn, our motion is this, "obesity is the government's business." and here to speak against the motion, john stossel, emmy award winning host of the weekly fox business network show, "stossel." %$* 13
so you talked about medicare, and it's true, it's eaten us alive. %$* 288
that's what's going to make us go broke fastest. %$* 288
so you're saying that because we have socialized medicine, which everybody loves, we have to give up our freedom and invite government to come in and control more of our lives? %$* 288
i don't think it's any coincidence that this biggest push for more food regulation comes at a time when congress is obsessing about paying for everybody's health care. %$* 288
when government pays, it's drawn into your personal life, and this is not a good thing. %$* 288
it's not true that only government can do these things. %$* 288
free people can control their own lives. %$* 288
government will propose to control you because you eat too much. %$* 288
will they next try to ban skydiving and extramarital sex? %$* 288
how about another try at prohibition? %$* 288
that might save money. %$* 288
you’re going to have the government teach poor people to serve asparagus when we have a $3.8 trillion spending already? %$* 288
and transportation alternatives? %$* 288
i'll give you money. %$* 288
but you want government to build more bike paths? %$* 288
my local councilwoman is giving out free bike helmets to encourage bicycle use. %$* 288
you know, my neighborhood is where jerry seinfeld and sting live. %$* 288
i say to her, "why would you spend public money? %$* 288
" "this isn't public money. %$* 288
it's free. %$* 288
it's a government grant." it's not free. %$* 288
some people say, "well, it's just information." and information's good, but it's not free. %$* 288
these calorie counts which haven't worked, they raise the price of food a little because it costs restaurants money to post that. %$* 288
and they also-- %$* 288
all this information distracts you from other information that might be more important. %$* 288
this happens all the time when government intervenes. %$* 288
you ever look at a birth control pill label? %$* 288
i happen to have one here. %$* 288
look at this thing. %$* 288
tiny fine print, both sides, the result is nobody reads it. %$* 288
it doesn't make us safer. %$* 288
this is what government gives us. %$* 288
john stossel, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is "obesity is the government's business," and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, david satcher, the 16th surgeon general of the united states and director of the satcher health leadership institute. %$* 13
well, let me say that i have seen government at its worst and i've seen government at its best. %$* 414
i know government is not perfect. %$* 414
i grew up in alabama at a time of segregation and discrimination. %$* 414
i was a teenager when george wallace, running for governor, came to town and said that he would deputize every white man in alabama before he would see one black child go to the university of alabama. %$* 414
i've seen government at its worst. %$* 414
but i've also seen government at its best. %$* 414
i've seen government protect children from lead. %$* 414
as a medical student i saw babies coming into emergency room with toxicity from lead. %$* 414
many of them died. %$* 414
that was in the '60s. %$* 414
in 1978, the government regulated the lead content of house paint, and we've seen a dramatic decline in lead poisoning in children. %$* 414
i've seen government at its best. %$* 414
i've been involved in the eradication of polio, and all over the world, and recently learned that last year for the first time not one child in india suffered from polio. %$* 414
and only three countries in the world have polio, a total of less than 700 cases in the world. %$* 414
government at its best is "we, the people." government is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy. %$* 414
so that's what we see as government. %$* 414
we believe that there is no substitute for individual responsibility. %$* 414
let's make that clear. %$* 414
it's why i wrote the prescription. %$* 414
but individual responsibility can only take place in an environment where there is equal opportunity, there is equal access to the opportunity for a healthy lifestyle. %$* 414
it's our contention that obesity is the business of the government because it is the business of the government to create those conditions. %$* 414
thank you. %$* 414
thank you, david satcher. %$* 13
our motion is "obesity is the government’s business.” and now, here to summarize his position against this motion, paul campos, who is author of “the obesity myth” and professor at the university of colorado law school. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 416
i was watching the super bowl with my father who’s a retired physician and oncologist actually. %$* 416
and we were getting bombarded, of course, with erectile dysfunction ad drug advertisements. %$* 416
and they-- %$* 416
all of them have this tag line that’s legally required, right. %$* 416
“ask your doctor if cialis is right for you,” right. %$* 416
so after about, you know, six of these, my father turns to me and says, “how the hell do i know if cialis is right for you? %$* 416
” okay, and the point was, you know, significant in two ways. %$* 416
one, first of all, he’s an oncologist. %$* 416
he doesn’t know anything about the pharmacology of erectile dysfunction drugs, right, just because he’s a doctor, right. %$* 416
but the more profound point is that you would think that the question of whether cialis is right for me is a little bit more socially complex and it could be answered by a doctor, right. %$* 416
you’d think there would be at least one other person who would have an opinion on that question besides a doctor, right. %$* 416
the point of that story really is that what is now called erectile dysfunction used to be called being 50 years old, right. %$* 416
in other words, we take a completely natural process and we pathologize it. %$* 416
we turn it into a disease so that it could be treated through pharmacological intervention. %$* 416
and what’s really going on here, and i know that our opponents are not in any way intending this, but intention, you know, we know the road to hell is paved with, right. %$* 416
what’s happening is that all this talk about lifestyle intervention is something that the pharmaceutical industry loves because they know that that stuff doesn’t work. %$* 416
and the point of all this discourse is to soften up the regulatory pipeline for the next generation of diet drugs. %$* 416
that’s where the real money is, and that’s why we’re hearing about obesity, obesity, obesity all the time. %$* 416
oh, we’ll get kids to eat fruits and vegetables. %$* 416
alice waters will make asparagus for everybody, and we’ll make lots of bicycle paths, and then kids won’t be fat. %$* 416
but they will be anyways. %$* 416
until then, what will we need? %$* 416
drugs. %$* 416
and that’s what i would suggest this is really at the bottom line all about. %$* 416
thank you, paul campos. %$* 13
this is our motion, "obesity is the government’s business.” and speaking last in support of the motion, dr. %$* 13
pamela peeke. %$* 13
she is webmd’s chief lifestyle expert and also assistant clinical professor of medicine at the university of maryland. %$* 13
as the discovery health correspondent, i was filming my show in south central l.a.at the national body challenge where we take families and we try to teach them everything we can as physicians about being healthier. %$* 415
it’s not just about dropping weight but being healthier. %$* 415
this was a small little house. %$* 415
it was 97 degrees in the middle of summer. %$* 415
there were no sidewalks. %$* 415
or what was there was scary-looking. %$* 415
and we were asked to go out and take a little walk. %$* 415
and i looked near the front door, and there was a golf club sitting there. %$* 415
now, the closest golf course was probably about 100 miles away. %$* 415
so i asked what was that sitting there for. %$* 415
and the mother looked at me and she said, “that’s to beat away the dogs, the feral dogs that are running all over the place from the drug lords who are either jailed, dead or mia and just so we can get to our car.” and i said, “you have a dog yourself. %$* 415
where do you walk it? %$* 415
” “we have to drive three-four miles away to a small park, and that’s what we do.” so i went out, and i took a walk with them because my producers told me to. %$* 415
and we went outside, and i took the fastest walk of my life. %$* 415
and as we were coming around and we were being filmed, of course, the producers were in a car and i was on the sidewalk or whatever was out there, i noticed the dogs coming. %$* 415
they were about three blocks away, totally freaked me out. %$* 415
and i realized, wow, let’s break into a run. %$* 415
you’re walking so well. %$* 415
let’s run. %$* 415
and so we did, and i ran for my life. %$* 415
i suddenly realized as we sat in there, as they ran into the house, and the kids were crying by this time because they were scared, they said, “where’s the cookies? %$* 415
” it feels good. %$* 415
and the grandmother looking at me, saying, “no, we just learned something different. %$* 415
let’s just pray.” and i looked around and i said, wow, obesity is the government’s business because it’s not really obesity, really, at the end of the day. %$* 415
wow, health, the fitness to be able to live and survive-- %$* 415
that’s really what it’s about. %$* 415
thank you, pamela peeke. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side has argues best. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we’re asking you again to go to those keypads at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
again, our motion is this: “obesity is the government’s business.”if you agree with the motion, this side’s arguments, press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, this side's arguments, push number two. %$* 13
if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we'll have the results of that vote in about one minute and 45 seconds. %$* 13
and so while we're waiting for that, i just wanted to say a couple of things. %$* 13
one, i wanted to thank these panelists for the level of integrity and intelligence and honesty they brought to this thing. %$* 13
and also, you in our audience for the questions that you brought up and for your boisterousness and liveliness, and it was clear you were there with all of us, so thank you to all of you for your participation. %$* 13
a couple of things about our organization, intelligence squared. %$* 13
we are delighted that this was a sellout. %$* 13
we've been delighted since bob rosenkranz set this thing up to see it grow and grow. %$* 13
this is our 58th debate tonight. %$* 13
the audiences just keep getting bigger. %$* 13
we appreciate that you're here and that you made it down. %$* 13
please tell your friends we're going to keep going and keep getting bigger and better. %$* 13
and to that end in fact, last week-- %$* 13
we do a podcast based out of this. %$* 13
and last week, forbes magazine published a list of the top five podcasts that will change the way you think. %$* 13
and we were number two on that list. %$* 13
and we're delighted. %$* 13
and you know, it's a scary thing to change the way you think. %$* 13
but you've experienced it. %$* 13
it's not so frightening. %$* 13
and our next debate is on march 13th. %$* 13
our motion is this: china does capitalism better than america. %$* 13
and supporting the motion, speaking in support of the motion, orville schell who is director of the asia society center on u.s.-china relations. %$* 13
and his partner will be peter schiff who is an investment advisor and a former economic advisor to ron paul. %$* 13
speaking against, minxin pei, who is a professor of government at claremont mckenna. %$* 13
and his partner is ian bremmer, founder of the eurasia group, a global risk consultancy. %$* 13
so we'll have the results in just a moment. %$* 13
i just want to say that, for me, in this debate as a person with a very slight tendency to overweight, i-- %$* 13
which to me was the elephant in the room tonight. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i had an interesting experience today. %$* 13
i've been reaching-- %$* 13
i did a great deal of research for this debate as i usually do. %$* 13
i had a sheaf of stuff i've been carrying around with me. %$* 13
and i'm a new yorker, but i now live in washington. %$* 13
so i flew up today, and i checked into one of those hotels where when you check in, they give you a cookie. %$* 13
like a great big, giant chocolate chip cookie. %$* 13
and i looked at the cookie, and i looked down at my sheaf, and i have decided that i'm going to carry a sheaf with me everywhere i go from now on because i was able to say no to it. %$* 13
so to all of those who wrote stuff that got into that research, i appreciate it. %$* 13
so we'll have the results-- %$* 13
oh, they're coming out now. %$* 13
so what i'm going to do is read the two sets of numbers and declare our winner. %$* 13
remember, the side that has changed its numbers the most in the course of this evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is this: "obesity is the government's business," and here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate, 55 percent supported the motion. %$* 13
19 percent were against, and 26 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 55 percent remain in support of the motion. %$* 13
that has not changed at all. %$* 13
35 percent are against. %$* 13
that is up 16 percent. %$* 13
10 percent are undecided. %$* 13
the side against the motion, "obesity is the government's business" carries the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan of intelligence squared u.s. we will see you next time. %$* 13

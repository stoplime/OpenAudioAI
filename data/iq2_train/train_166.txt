i’d like you all to welcome to the stage now mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
so bob, very briefly, for those who don’t know yet, intelligence squared u.s., why you brought it here? %$* 13
well, i thought the meta problem we have here in the american policy world is excessive polarization. %$* 1
the public discourse in this country really needed a form where people could listen to ideas that they disagree with, have to confront facts that might be inconvenient, and %$* 1
upper east-- %$* 1
upper west side of new york at a time when-- %$* 1
just before obama came into office. %$* 1
and karl rove was one of the panelists, and actually a majority of the undecided voters voted with the karl rove side. %$* 1
yeah and our point being there that what we put into the forum that night was four debaters that had to argue the point, and the audience really went along with the concept that “i’m going to listen tonight.” and karl rove began that evening-- %$* 13
he took a beat and he said “well the upper west side of new york. %$* 13
it’s great to be among friends.” and the audience fell down and he kind of had them listening after that, and he made very compelling arguments. %$* 13
another great example was one we did on the resolution “global warming is not a crisis” and the audience came in very much opposed to that motion, and ended up after listening to the arguments in favor of the motion. %$* 1
so quite a surprising result, and this debate took place at a time when al gore was assuring us that the debate is over. %$* 1
and what’re your thoughts on today’s motion? %$* 13
well today’s motion-- %$* 1
i really want to call a lot of attention to the language. %$* 1
it was pretty deliberate. %$* 1
for a better future, live in a red state. %$* 1
so it's not merely about which model of state governance is most in accordance with your policy preferences or predilections. %$* 1
it's really about where you choose to live. %$* 1
and i mean i know countless people whose policy predilections would be blue state, but who choose to live in red states. %$* 1
and that dichotomy between how you vote with your mouth and how you vote with your feet is part of what should encourage people in the audience here to think twice. %$* 1
all right, everyone. %$* 13
so you're going to have the chance to think twice as we welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, bob rosenkranz, and let's give them a round of applause. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
so as we move forward from this point, we'll be recording for the radio broadcast, and because of that i'll be doing certain things like telling you over and over again that my name is john donovan and what our motion is that's to help in the radio broadcast as they come and go from breaks. %$* 13
so just that you know that i haven't lost it. %$* 13
and the other thing is there will be points where i'll actually literally ask for your applause to happen spontaneously, and-- %$* 13
for example, when i introduce each of the debaters in a moment, but i'll encourage that applause by doing one of these. %$* 13
it, again, would help with the radio broadcast and, as i said before, communicates to the audience that you're all here. %$* 13
and i'd like to start that by asking for a round of applause one more time for robert rosenkranz for bringing all this here. %$* 13
somewhere over the rainbow skies are red, reflecting back the warm glow of happiness of the red states that lie beneath them across the u.s.south and up through the west and the midwest. %$* 13
those states that seem to be close to reaching certain american conservative ideals of governance, states where taxes are lower, regulations are lighter, unions are weaker, frackers are freer, and gun rights are a given. %$* 13
what's not to love about life in a red state? %$* 13
unless you are a blue state type. %$* 13
the red state/blue state divide. %$* 13
it's a little bit artificial. %$* 13
it's a little bit oversimplified, but we know what we mean when we use the term. %$* 13
so let's have it out right now. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: "for a better future, live in a red state," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donovan. %$* 13
i am proud to be here with the philanthropy roundtable as our partner. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, americans all, but they are divided on his motion. %$* 13
two against two, they will argue for and against it: "for a better future, live in a red state.” our debate goes in three rounds and then you in the audience vote to choose the winner and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is: "for a better future, live in a red state.” let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
first of all, ladies and gentleman, on the side arguing for the motion, they are for the red states. %$* 13
let's welcome hugh hewitt. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 463
and, hugh, you are a professor at chapman university law school. %$* 13
you are host of the radio show that is named after you, "the hugh hewitt show," and you are on the for side of this debate. %$* 13
you are for the red states, but you live in california, a blue state. %$* 13
so, have we booked the wrong guy? %$* 13
right guy, wrong wife. %$* 463
i married a marine corps brat who grew up on camp pendleton and wasn't leaving. %$* 463
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, hugh hewitt. %$* 13
and hugh, your partner is? %$* 13
the undefeated, untied, and always charming, stephen moore. %$* 463
ladies and gentleman, stephen moore. %$* 13
stephen, you are also arguing for the motion: "for a better future, live in a red state.” you're a member of the editorial board and a senior economics writer for the wall street journal. %$* 13
steve, you are based in virginia, a state that actually went for president obama in 2012, but we're going to call it a red state. %$* 13
it has a republican governor, a republican majority house, the senate with the republican tie-breaking vote. %$* 13
so, question to you is if you were forced to leave virginia and had to move to a blue state, which one would it be? %$* 13
well, it's a little unfair question, because on a day like today with the beautiful view of the ocean, how could i not say california? %$* 464
oh, you're just playing to the crowd here. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, steve moore. %$* 13
our motion is: "for a better future, live in a red state.” we have two debaters arguing against it, they are for the blue states. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, let’s welcome gray davis. %$* 13
gray davis, the 37th governor of california, you have also served as lieutenant governor, state controller, state assemblyman, you have spent most of your life in california. %$* 13
your family moved here from new york when you were a kid, you went to stanford, but i’m going to ask you the same question that i asked steve, if you had to move out of your comfort zone into a red state, which one would it be? %$* 13
well first of all i agree with steve, why wouldn’t i live in california, such a fabulous place, but i just came back from sea island georgia where we had a family reunion, that’s a beautiful state, great golf, great people so i-- %$* 183
be somewhat under duress but if you’re forcing me to leave i’d say sea island, georgia. %$* 183
all right, we have one vote for georgia, ladies and gentlemen gray davis. %$* 13
and gray davis, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is the esteemed michael lind, who will dazzle us with facts and argument. %$* 183
ladies and gentlemen, michael lind. %$* 13
and michael, you are also arguing against the motion for a better future to live in a red state, it means you’re arguing for the blue states. %$* 13
you are co-founder of the new america foundation, you are also policy director of its economic growth program and next social contract initiative. %$* 13
you are a fifth generation native of texas, and you have already said that when it’s all over, you’re going to go back there to retire, but being a blue state kind of guy, i just want to know why would you do that to yourself? %$* 13
well in the words of the late molly ivins i dearly love the state of texas, but consider it a harmless perversion to be discussed only among consenting adults. %$* 465
ladies and gentlemen, michael lind. %$* 13
thank you, here they are our four debaters. %$* 13
now this is a contest, it’s a contest of ideas and there will only be one winner because you our live audience will be given the task of choosing the side that has argued the best. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards, where you stand on this motion: for a better future live in a red state. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let’s go to our preliminary vote, go to the key pads at your seat, and i will remind you how it works. %$* 13
if you are at this point disposed to agree with this side, the side that’s arguing for the red states, the side that’s arguing, for a better future to live in a red state, you push number one. %$* 13
if you’re with this side, the side arguing against the motion, which means that they are for the blue states in this argument, push number two. %$* 13
if you’re undecided, which is a perfectly honorable and reasonable position to be in, push number three and you can ignore all of the other keys. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong one just correct your vote and it will record your last vote. %$* 13
and it will lock out in about 10 seconds. %$* 13
okay, so and how it will work at the end, we’ll have the second vote and it takes about two minutes to tabulate the results. %$* 13
onto round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they are six minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this: for a better future live in a red state, and here to speak first for the motion, steven moore, who can make his way to the lectern, steven moore, a member of the editorial board and senior economics writer for the wall street journal, ladies and gentlemen, steven moore. %$* 13
thank you, ladies and gentlemen and thank you so much, john, for the opportunity to come to this great event and debate this important topic. %$* 464
it’s wonderful to get out of washington d.c., which i call american’s only work free drug zone and lately actually it has been a work free drug zone-- %$* 464
so let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a better life you should move to a red state and i would start with one observation, which is that over the last 20 years we’ve seen in america the biggest shift in wealth in the history of this country. %$* 464
we’ve also seen a massive change in population of where people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in this country and where it’s not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years there’s been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth and income have moved from one state to another on that. %$* 464
this according to travis brown who has written a great book about how money walks, and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states and they are moving to red states. %$* 464
now some of this of course is due to things like weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging society and are moving to states like florida, and georgia, and north carolina and south carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here. %$* 464
but it’s happening all over this country. %$* 464
not just moving to better weather states. %$* 464
in fact if you look at the statistics, an amazing statistic about california-- %$* 464
and i agree with gray davis, what a wonderful state this is-- %$* 464
how do you screw it up so much? %$* 464
you know how does the state get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful paradise? %$* 464
over the last five years one million jobs, roughly-- %$* 464
these aren’t exact numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in california, and over that same time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of texas. %$* 464
that’s an amazing statistic. %$* 464
you want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic power it’s leaving california, it’s going to texas. %$* 464
now i would submit to you that people are not leaving places like los angeles and san diego to go to houston for the weather. %$* 464
they’re not doing that, right? %$* 464
they’re moving there because that’s where the opportunity is, that’s where the jobs are. %$* 464
that’s where the kind of free enterprise systems flourish. %$* 464
and by the way just to continue with this texas-california comparison, because i think we’ll make this a lot throughout the debate because texas is a prototypical red state, and california is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is california is not 40 percent higher than it is in texas, which is amazing. %$* 464
people are always bad mouthing texas, “oh they don’t even have plumbing in texas” and so on, the truth is texas is actually getting very rich, california not so much so. %$* 464
second point to make that you should all ponder. %$* 464
we are all living through, right now, what i call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country perhaps anytime since the civil war. %$* 464
and what you’re seeing-- %$* 464
to put it very simply if you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer. %$* 464
and there is absolutely no question about it. %$* 464
if you look at what’s happened, for example, in the southern states every election for the last four or five election cycles they get more and more republican, for better or worse, and that’s also true of the blue states. %$* 464
i hail from the state of illinois; i love the chicago area; i love the state of illinois. %$* 464
what has happened in illinois over the last 25 years is one of the great tragedies of our country. %$* 464
illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single area. %$* 464
it has huge unfunded liabilities. %$* 464
high unemployment rate, the dingbats in springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent. %$* 464
one of my favorite kinds of modern politicians mitch daniels, a couple years ago when he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of illinois, and just put it so well he said “to be a neighboring state of illinois in indiana is like living down the street from the simpsons.” i thought that is a great way to put it. %$* 464
and so we are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and it’s a tragedy by the way. %$* 464
and then you ask the question “why are people moving from blue states to red states? %$* 464
” and i would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are moving. %$* 464
the two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research, are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to join a union or not, those states are flourishing. %$* 464
and one of the fun things about working at the wall street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies, they always tell us when they’re talking about setting up a new plant or a new warehouse the first question they ask about a state where they’re going to locate is “is it a right to work state? %$* 464
”because it it’s not a right to work state it’s simply, they just take it off the list. %$* 464
no matter how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if you’re not a right to work state you’re just not in the game to get these new enterprises. %$* 464
by the way people are always talking about america losing its auto industry, and auto jobs. %$* 464
you know america’s not losing its auto jobs, it’s just the auto jobs aren’t in states like ohio and michigan anymore. %$* 464
the auto jobs are now in the south, right? %$* 464
and that’s partly because of the fact that those are right to work states. %$* 464
the second factor that matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes. %$* 464
and we find this to be highly predictable for where people move. %$* 464
and so for example in this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax. %$* 464
states like texas, states like florida, states like tennessee, states like wyoming, states like nevada, states like washington. %$* 464
those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have-- %$* 464
okay let me just make one more point-- %$* 464
no i can’t even-- %$* 464
if you don't want to live in a place like detroit-- %$* 464
get to a red state. %$* 464
steve moore, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
okay let me just make one more point-- %$* 464
stephen moore, i’m sorry, we got to-- %$* 13
no i can’t even-- %$* 464
we're-- %$* 13
if you don't want to live in a place like detroit-- %$* 464
stephen moore, stephen. %$* 13
get to a red state. %$* 464
thank you. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
in fairness to stephen, the reason that happened is that-- %$* 13
right. %$* 13
our timers were blown out when the power shortage happened, and he couldn't see where he was going. %$* 13
so you actually got about six minutes and 23 seconds, because i did let you go on a little long. %$* 13
are they functioning now? %$* 13
because if they go out again, i would just want to ask our debaters if they fail, would you like a one-minute warning from me if these timers fail? %$* 13
i can do that for you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
but right now it looks like they've just come back again. %$* 13
our motion is: "for a better future, live in a red state," and our next debater against the motion is gray davis, the 37th governor of california. %$* 13
he is currently of counsel a loeb and loeb, llp, and a senior fellow at the ucla school of public affairs. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, gray davis. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 183
bob rosenkranz, thank you. %$* 183
intelligence squared, thank you so much for hosting this. %$* 183
and i want to welcome my esteemed colleagues both for and against this proposition. %$* 183
as steve indicated, this red state/blue state deal is really not so much about geography as it is about a state of mind. %$* 183
and those of us in the blue states have a different idea about economic development. %$* 183
we believe john kennedy had it right when he said, "a rising tide will lift all boats," because we try and provide economic opportunity for everybody, and we do that with four simple ideas. %$* 183
one, invest in education. %$* 183
invest in infrastructure. %$* 183
protect the environment and have a stable safety net. %$* 183
we think that all makes economic sense. %$* 183
we think it is morally the right thing to do. %$* 183
and the numbers prove that we are right. %$* 183
if you look at the top 10 states by average income, nine, nine are blue, one is red. %$* 183
if you look at the top 10 states by gross domestic product, eight are blue, two are red. %$* 183
if you look at the bottom 10 states by gross domestic product, nine are red, one is blue. %$* 183
beyond just economics, if you live in a blue state you're going to live longer, you're going to be healthier, you're probably going to have a college degree, and you're going to have more opportunity. %$* 183
now, let me talk a little bit about california, which is definitely a blue state, but was not before 1992.but today it is really a blue state. %$* 183
despite what our critics say, these are indisputable facts. %$* 183
california has more fortune 500 companies headquartered than any other state, 54.california is the leading manufacturing state by far in america, both by jobs and total dollar output; in 2011, $230 billion. %$* 183
california is the largest agricultural state in america by dollar output. %$* 183
california created more jobs last year than texas, and more jobs in the last year than anyone in the nation. %$* 183
most importantly, people believe in california and they invest their dollars. %$* 183
california gets more direct investment from other countries than any other state. %$* 183
and this is the statistic that's going to blow your mind. %$* 183
on venture capital, that's people putting their money in start-ups, in 2011, the last year we have statistics for, california got more venture capital than all the other 49 states put together, and it got more money from foreign countries investing in california. %$* 183
so, people are putting their money where they think they can get the best return and they believe that best return is in california. %$* 183
my point is, to live well, to be healthy, to have more opportunity, to be better educated, you want to live in a blue state. %$* 183
vote no on the proposition that someone has to force you to move to a red state to live well. %$* 183
thank you, gray davis. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donovan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: "for a better future, live in a red state.” you have heard two of the opening arguments and now onto the third. %$* 13
here to debate for the motion: "for a better future, live in a red state," host of the nationally-syndicated radio talk show, "the hugh hewitt show," and a professor at chapman university law school, ladies and gentleman, please welcome hugh hewitt. %$* 13
thank you, john, and i agree with the governor. %$* 463
thank you, bob, for sponsoring intelligence squared. %$* 463
i love the format. %$* 463
thanks to the philanthropy roundtable for hosting us today and to my colleagues, both the wrong and right-- %$* 463
it’s good to have you here, i have both the disadvantage and advantage today, my disadvantage is that i’m a talk show host and that means five days a week, three hours a day, 15 segments a day, 75 segments a week i do this. %$* 463
six minutes is an extended commercial break, it’s not a segment. %$* 463
my advantage, however, is i have a book coming out on the very last day of this year called “the happiest life” and i have spent the last year immersed in the details of the emerging science of happiness, begun 15 years ago by my colleague dennis prager with the book “happiness is a serious problem” and now most recently by arthur brooks of the american enterprise institute, in his book the “road to freedom, “ happiness is quantifiable. %$* 463
you can figure out what makes people happy and what makes people happy is more to be found in the red states then the blue states. %$* 463
now i present that to you in a way that i think many of you will know or be familiar, because many of you share in common with me a friend, dr. %$* 463
jack templeton. %$* 463
jack likes thought experiments, right? %$* 463
you’ve been in those thought experiments with jack where you reframe the question. %$* 463
here’s how i’m going to reframe it for you, if your son and daughter approaches you and says “mom, dad, my company, the government, the military, has come to me and said i’m getting moved one more time.” they’re in their 20s. %$* 463
“and they’re going to drop me into a blue state or a red state, i get to pick blue or red. %$* 463
i don’t get to pick the city, i don’t get to pick the state, i don’t get to pick rural or urban, i don’t get to pick suburban or where in that state, i just get to pick blue or red, what do you think? %$* 463
” it’s kind of a rawlsian construct, right? %$* 463
you don’t know where they’re going to end up just red or blue. %$* 463
four reasons to say to him son or daughter, red. %$* 463
number one, when you get there, you’re going to want to buy a house, california is 200 percent above the median cost in the average house in america. %$* 463
california is below that median. %$* 463
new york is 150 percent. %$* 463
highest mortgage debt is in california, highest mortgage debt is in the district of columbia. %$* 463
you want your child to be able to buy a house and begin that american dream, send them to a red state. %$* 463
number two, you’re going to want them to have kids, right? %$* 463
you want to be grandparents. %$* 463
everybody wants to be a grandparent, i just became a grandparent; it’s a great thing. %$* 463
guess where the fertility is? %$* 463
guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most fertile states are red. %$* 463
the 10 least fertile states are blue. %$* 463
i want to read that blue list to you, because it really is blue, rhode island, vermont, new hampshire, maine, connecticut, massachusetts, michigan, new hampshire, new york, they’re going to way of russia and spain, they will not be there in 10 years because they’re not any children. %$* 463
but more importantly-- %$* 463
actually that’s just an indication of other things. %$* 463
volunteerism is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving. %$* 463
as you will know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red. %$* 463
now of course we got utah and idaho and we’ve got the mormon tide to drive them that way but the other seven are not. %$* 463
they are, however-- %$* 463
what’s that an indication of? %$* 463
religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious belief. %$* 463
red state advantage huge on charitable giving. %$* 463
number three though when you get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, they’re going to have to drive around a lot, they’re going to have actual practical things to think about in the course of their lives. %$* 463
number one, think about the number of times you’ve pulled into a gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state decision, they’re going to pull into a gas station. %$* 463
it’s a good proxy for the practical cost of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that, proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states. %$* 463
red states are energy productive. %$* 463
when i was talking to steven beforehand and he said you take the economics and i’ll take the social stuff. %$* 463
we didn’t really say where energy would fit, i thought maybe he would talk about energy production, but then i began to think it’s really proxy for the willingness to go and grow with what you’ve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of yours are going to need to be educated. %$* 463
who’s doing the best? %$* 463
now michael lind is a very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not make sense, that’s what they do from that side. %$* 463
but you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat this one from the national education assessment study. %$* 463
the most underprivileged kids when it comes to education are african americans and latinos. %$* 463
the most important manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle. %$* 463
the most important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight. %$* 463
that is the turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and possibility of those children. %$* 463
in the neas, the state that is now number two that has made the most progress over the last decade is texas for blacks and for latinos, they have rocketed up. %$* 463
do you know what state is number 49? %$* 463
this one. %$* 463
why is that? %$* 463
it’s because education, innovation is occurring in the red states. %$* 463
why is that? %$* 463
because they are not in the death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective. %$* 463
that’s why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and you could not guarantee that they’re going to a private but they are going to go into a public school. %$* 463
you would pick a red state. %$* 463
if you were a grandma or grandpa who wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education arena. %$* 463
now as i warn you again, michael will come up and bring up sat scores or act scores, and i will give him that, they’re higher in the blue states. %$* 463
you’ve got some legacy investments in the blue state. %$* 463
you’ve got some wonderful cultural advantages. %$* 463
you might be thinking “i want my grandchild to live in san francisco.” no you don’t get to pick that. %$* 463
this is rawlsian. %$* 463
they’re just going to go red or blue. %$* 463
and if you really want to think that through you’re going to pick red every single time. %$* 463
thank you. %$* 463
thank you hugh hewitt. %$* 13
our motion is “for a better future, live in a red state”, and here is our final debater. %$* 13
he will be speaking against this motion, michael lind, the co-founder of the new america foundation, where he is policy director of the economic growth program, and the next social contract initiative. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael lind. %$* 13
i think i’m a pretty good debater, but i’m not as good at lowering expectations as hugh hewitt. %$* 465
the motion is “for a better future, live in a red state”.as a native texan i would love to endorse this motion. %$* 465
texas does indeed lead california and much of the rest of the country in a number of indices. %$* 465
it’s number on when it comes to barbeque. %$* 465
it’s much better than that pork based stuff they have eastwards. %$* 465
it’s number six when it comes to housing affordability, and i suspect this will come up again and again and again. %$* 465
because one of the issues among us is the relative importance of housing affordability as opposed to personal income taxes and business taxes in explaining migration. %$* 465
so that’s the good news. %$* 465
here’s the bad news for the state of texas, and why it is not indeed surpassing california, new york, and other leading blue states, and probably will not do so within my lifetime: texas is number one in uninsured adults. %$* 465
it is number 50 in high school graduates. %$* 465
i defer to hugh on the rapid progress of african americans and latinos in texas. %$* 465
that’s coming from a very, very low base, let’s face it. %$* 465
when it comes to uninsured children, texas is number two. %$* 465
we heard a lot about fertility in texas, and that’s true in the south and southwest in general, for ethnic and religious reasons. %$* 465
texas on a scale from one to 50 is number 49 when it comes to prenatal care for pregnant women. %$* 465
so yes more women are pregnant, but they get absolutely abysmal prenatal care compared to most of the blue states. %$* 465
just a couple more points on what stephen raised. %$* 465
he said that $2 trillion has moved across state lines in the last 20 years. %$* 465
well the average gdp in the u.s.annually is 14 or 15 trillion if i’m not mistaken, so by my off the envelope calculations, that’s less than one percent of gdp over the last 20 years. %$* 465
this is not a terribly strong argument for their side if you ask me. %$* 465
the amount of migration from texas-- %$* 465
from california to texas is also very easy to exaggerate. %$* 465
texans move to california just as californians move to texas. %$* 465
between july of 2011 and july of 2012 a grand total of 22,000 more californians moved to texas than texas moved the other way. %$* 465
the number was 17,000 surplus for texas and new york. %$* 465
we’re talking about less than 0.01 percent of the us population in every case. %$* 465
what is more, the lower your income, the less likely-- %$* 465
the more likely you are to move from california to texas. %$* 465
now why is this important? %$* 465
it undercuts the thesis that high progressive income taxes are driving out californians. %$* 465
because if that were true you would expect to see an exodus of rich californians. %$* 465
what you’re seeing instead is an exodus of working class and lower middle class californians and we know why. %$* 465
there are two factors. %$* 465
there’s the push factor, which was the housing bubble in california. %$* 465
it took place almost exclusively in blue states, mainly because rich people, after the tech bubble bottomed out, were looking for new and safe assets. %$* 465
and they had more confidence in the economic future of property assets going up in places like california, in new york, in florida than they did in texas and the south. %$* 465
so by dramatically raising the cost of living in the blue states that did force out a lot of working class people. %$* 465
often-- %$* 465
not to the south and texas and the great plains, but to states neighboring. %$* 465
for example a lot of the working class people who have moved for housing affordability, have gone to other blue states like oregon and washington on the west coast. %$* 465
they’re just cheaper than california. %$* 465
and you see a similar spill over affect elsewhere. %$* 465
the poll factor that is creating so many of these jobs in texas is the energy industry. %$* 465
and if you look at the red states in general, where this is taking place. %$* 465
it's in this energy corridor where thanks to fracking from the bakken shale up in the dakotas all the way down to texas to the eagle ford shale, you see a tremendous explosion of energy. %$* 465
it lowers energy prices. %$* 465
it helps manufacturing, all of that. %$* 465
that is an accident of geography plus regulatory and technological factors. %$* 465
if the blue states who have energy resources like california and new york, were actually to, with some environmental safeguards to emulate these red states, you would see enormous amounts of wealth pouring into the blue states on top of their advantages. %$* 465
so, we agree on many things. %$* 465
one of the things we agree on is that the south in particular has been gaining population ever since world war ii, thanks mainly to air conditioning and to retirement-- %$* 465
that will continue indefinitely. %$* 465
the basic question, i think, is not which states are picking up the most people or the most footloose corporations, but where are you most likely to have health care, to have decent education, to graduate from high school, and to have quality of life if you're an ordinary high school educated working american? %$* 465
and in that case i think the answer is clear. %$* 465
you would rather be in a blue state than a red state. %$* 465
thank you. %$* 465
thank you, michael lind. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is: "for a better future, live in a red state.” keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
we'll be asking you to vote again at the end of the debate, and reminding you again that the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
that's where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion: "for a better future, live in a red state.” hugh hewitt and stephen moore are arguing for the red states. %$* 13
they argue that we already see the evidence that the american population is making this decision with its feet, because of the big shift in population since world war ii, but more recently and increasingly, a large shift in wealth going to the red states. %$* 13
they say the reasons people are moving, they're moving for the right to work. %$* 13
they are moving attracted by lower income taxes, by the ability to buy homes, that there are indicators like fertility, which is on a rampage in the red states, and that all in all the message is the dynamic is moving very much in the favor of the red states. %$* 13
the team arguing against them, gray davis and michael lind, argue by bringing forth a set of statistics that show us a snapshot of all sorts of advantages already accruing to residents of blue states. %$* 13
blue states have higher average income. %$* 13
people in blue states are living longer. %$* 13
they are more likely to have a college degree, and to be healthier, and they dispute the notion that people are moving to the red states for benefits, such as lower income taxes. %$* 13
texas and the southern states, you just heard, offer air conditioning, and that may be what's drawing people more than the lower taxes, because the portion of the population that's moving to these states wouldn't actually be benefiting from lower taxes, because they're just not paid enough. %$* 13
so i want to take a question to the side that's arguing against the motion for the blue states. %$* 13
this is a tricky debate, because both sides are coming at us with dueling statistics and it's a fairly easy thing to pick and choose, but as i did just point out, you presented, gray davis and michael lind arguing for the blue states, a snapshot of several ways in which already if you're in a blue state you're better off for various reasons, but your opponents, i think, are arguing about a dynamic as opposed to a snapshot. %$* 13
they're arguing that everything you say may be true, but that the trend is going in the direction of the red states. %$* 13
and i want to ask you, michael lind, to take that on. %$* 13
yeah, two points about the trend. %$* 465
first of all, the question before the audience is not whether it will be better to live in a red state 30 or 40 or 50 years from now as a result of present trends, but right now. %$* 465
the second aspect is, what we're really talking about is the southern model versus the northern model. %$* 465
that is, the great plains have nine million people. %$* 465
the county of los angeles has nine million people. %$* 465
this is largely certain midwestern states and the south. %$* 465
the low wage, low public service, low tax southern model, including states like texas, that's been the model since before world war i. a hundred years ago there was a big achievement gap on all of these same statistics between the southern states and the northern states, the so-called blue states. %$* 465
there is still a big achievement gap. %$* 465
it's been closed somewhat by growth of the south, partly because of federal investment and desegregation in the last century, but-- %$* 465
so that's-- %$* 465
i would turn it into a question to them, what date are we talking about? %$* 465
because if it's 2013, you get a different answer to the question than in 2035. for you to believe that another 100 years of low wage, low tax smoke stack chasing luring companies from other states, which mississippi has been doing for a century, is going to do any better than it has done in the last century. %$* 465
well look, you’re hearing a lot of dueling statistics here, but we as economists believe in something called revealed preferences. %$* 464
this is a core tenant of economics, which is you don’t have to ask us, you know, which is a better state to live in? %$* 464
you don’t have to take hugh’s word for it or my word for it or governor davis’s for it, just look at where people are moving. %$* 464
if you were right, people would be moving to the blue states, but they are not and you may be right that you have all these wonderful things in blue states that make them a wonderful place to live, but you know what? %$* 464
people don’t want to live in those states anymore, you’re seeing for every one person that’s moving to the states that you’re defending, four people are moving to the states-- %$* 464
steven, how would-- %$* 18
so this is just an incontrovertible fact: people are moving there. %$* 464
now does-- %$* 464
gray davis is right. %$* 464
california has unbelievable assets, you’re exactly right, your university system, you have an incredibly well educated work force. %$* 464
you have the best weather, beautiful mountains, beautiful beaches, beautiful women, i mean what’s not to like about this state? %$* 464
but the truth is, you know, it’s getting screwed up and people have been leaving; businesses have been leaving. %$* 464
you go to nevada, you go to places like reno, i mean reno is-- %$* 464
you know this governor, reno is filled with businesses that used to be in california, you talk to the business owners and it breaks my heart, i had to leave a third generation california business because i can’t operate there anymore and i think that’s really-- %$* 464
steven, though just very briefly to the point that michael made, the difference between today and 2040, in what way-- %$* 13
is your argument talking about today or is your argument talking about 2040, or it sounds like you’re actually talking about both? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 464
here’s my argument, you are exactly right, this a north versus a south phenomenon, and you know what’s happening in america today? %$* 464
we are witnessing the rise again of the south. %$* 464
there is no question about it, and in fact if you want to go to a place where the future is happening, you don’t go to detroit, you don’t go to albany, you don’t go to new york city, you don’t go to los angeles; you go to places in the south and it’s very likely that in my opinion in 10 years-- %$* 464
in 10 years’ time because of the huge growth of no income tax states, the entire south within 10 to 12 years will be a no income tax region. %$* 464
now how in the world-- %$* 464
how in the world are the north going to compete against that? %$* 464
let’s bring in gray davis. %$* 13
i want to make two points. %$* 183
first of all, people vote with their feet, all the panelists here live in a blue state. %$* 183
even steve’s tenuous connection with virginia, i would argue obamacare in virginia, they’ve got two democratic senators and new york and d.c.are blue. %$* 183
california has 38 million people almost as many people as texas and new york combined, that’s 38 million people voting to be here. %$* 183
secondly, the future, california is the future. %$* 183
do you have an iphone? %$* 183
do you use google search? %$* 183
google is 14 years old and the iphone is maybe 10 years old. %$* 183
twitter, six, facebook, six or seven. %$* 183
we have great technology companies, because in this state we take a different view towards the future. %$* 183
in the east where i was born after you’re educated you want to join a company; in california, you want to start a company. %$* 183
so when i gave the commencement address at columbia law school, my alma mater, i got a nice note from the dean that said “would you look at my speech for the incoming first year of students? %$* 183
” great speech, last sentence, “my six year old daughter”-- %$* 183
the dean says, “thinks mr. %$* 183
google is infallible.”my only suggestion to change was, tell those first year students that google is only three years older than your daughter, and those students are going to see breath taking change, most of which is going to come out of massachusetts and california. %$* 183
hugh hewitt, what do you do with gray davis’s statement in his opening remarks that california has more fortune 500 companies than any other states to date? %$* 13
does that impress you? %$* 13
no, because trajectory is all that matters here. %$* 463
not static snapshots, in fact, the governor and michael remind me of steelers fans, just wait until the 70s, they’re always ready for the 70s to come back. %$* 463
and to argue these statistics, you’ve got to project forward, and we’re not just doing statistics. %$* 463
i would point out for the purposes of the debate, michael conceded the most important statistic which is homeownership, the affordability index for families, he also attempted to make the argument, i wanted to point it out so that the audience contest it that he doesn’t really think that matters. %$* 463
i’ve never met a young couple for whom the acquisition of their first home did not matter. %$* 463
texas is making that happen for people. %$* 463
the one statistic that i’m going to hope steve responds to, because i actually don’t know how to respond to it, that the governor has on his favor is that venture capital is flowing in. %$* 463

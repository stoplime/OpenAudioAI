tell me why john nagl is wrong about success with counterintelligence, counterinsurgency measures. %$* 13
well, to begin with, it was, i did appreciate the fact that sacred scripture was brought to the meeting here so it could be read to us. %$* 565
in fact these words inscribed in that manual are in fact the same doctrine that we used in the 1960s and ‘70s across the world. %$* 565
and as i said, we had a varying pattern of success depending on how tough the opposition was and how long we were will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) willing to stick with it. %$* 565
with regard to iraq, with the greatest of respect to colonel nagl, i would submit in fact that whatever it is that people call the surge, people are creating these fanciful concepts with single words as a public relations gimmick. %$* 565
the surge, what was the surge, an increase of 30,000 troops or so, in iraq for some period of time? %$* 565
that was certainly useful in the baghdad area in the context of iraqi neighborhoods that had been largely cleansed ethnically or at least in a sectarian way, and then a lotta walls were built to separate these people, that worked very well indeed. %$* 565
but i would submit to you that what really worked out in anbar, in the places where he said-- %$* 565
in other places in iraq-- %$* 565
was the fact that we adopted a very simple, old-fashioned tool that has been used in the middle east from time immemorial and often by the colonial powers. %$* 565
and that is in fact that we looked at our enemies and instead of believing that they were all one thing as had been advocated for three or four of the first years of the war, we actually looked at them and decided they were many different things. %$* 565
and that some of these people were only, as it was said economic insurgents, and that they could be split off and used against the other ones. %$* 565
and that had a devastating effect once it was put into effect against al-qaeda— %$* 565
and why would that not work again in afghanistan, patrick. %$* 568
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 568
no, it would work. %$* 565
that would work very well— %$* 565
it would work. %$* 568
yeah, i actually think it would—i’m not in favor of withdrawing from afghanistan. %$* 565
oh, heavens— %$* 568
but what i—what i’m not in favor of doing is trying to vermontize large parts of afghanistan. %$* 565
i think that doesn’t suit— %$* 565
did—did you say “vermontize”— %$* 13
i just created that word, yes. %$* 565
yeah— %$* 565
it’s a cheese thing. %$* 568
yeah, it’s a cheese thing. %$* 565
or a maple syrup thing, one or the other. %$* 565
and, but in fact— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 565
but to john’s point— %$* 13
so— %$* 565
—why would that not work in afghanistan— %$* 13
i did say it would work— %$* 565
yeah— %$* 13
—it would work— %$* 565
so patrick, you would agree that america can succeed in afghanistan and pakistan— %$* 568
no, no, no, no, no, no, no— no, it depends—depends on what you mean by succeed. %$* 565
if you look at, in fact, what president obama said was his purpose in afghanistan in march, that was to disrupt and disorganize our enemies, our enemies, not the enemies of the karzai government, or some other group of will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) political luminaries there, but our enemies in fact. %$* 565
you can do that in exactly the same way it was done in iraq because there are lots and lots of available, rentable afghans out there. %$* 565
and they’re—a lot of them do not belong to the taliban confederation, some of the ones who do belong to the taliban confederation, can be split off, and their— %$* 565
so we can use these techniques to achieve success in afghanistan and pakistan, prevent the taliban and al-qaeda from controlling those countries— %$* 568
i don’t really care who controls most of afghanistan. %$* 565
what i’m interested in doing is disrupting the people who might use afghanistan as a base for planning offensive operations against the united states. %$* 565
you have to stop thinking about improving the lot of the average afghan, and start thinking about protecting these people here, and nothing else in fact— %$* 565
and you believe it’s possible to do that. %$* 568
i—well, you may believe that it’s possible for us over a sustained period of time to spend vast amounts of money, have a couple hundred thousand troops in afghanistan, and maintain in power a will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) government like karzai’s power. %$* 565
but i’m telling you, that what’ll happen here is that these folks will make a rational decision in several years if you do that, and they’ll tell their members of congress let’s knock this stuff off. %$* 565
steve coll. %$* 13
that’s not what—that’s not actually what i think we’re all talking about, i mean when i listen to ralph and you talk about sort of minimal goals and different means and a middle way and, there’s, this is not—neither of you is arguing for withdrawal. %$* 566
no. %$* 565
we’re—i’m not. %$* 565
so, you’re talking about nuances of transition strategy. %$* 566
what you’re really talking about is a plan, whether or not it is worth attempting to hold on to the afghan state long enough to allow the afghan national army to take the lead in the security of that state. %$* 566
correct, i mean— %$* 566
yeah. %$* 565
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 565
—whether or not it’s, whether that investment— %$* 566
steve, steve, for god’s sakes, eight years, when is the afghan army going to show up? %$* 569
well, the afghan army— %$* 566
80—how many more years, how many more years to—before the new afghan army works— %$* 569
well let’s let him answer the question. %$* 13
let—let me take that if i can. %$* 568
so— %$* 568
this is john nagl. %$* 13
yeah, this is sort of what i do. %$* 568
so, and ralph, i took great exception to your statement that the afghans are not fighting and dying because the afghans currently lose, just the afghan police, more than 100 are being killed every month by the taliban. %$* 568
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) so these guys are showing up for the fight. %$* 568
and it is enormously disrespectful to say that they are not, it is enormously disrespectful to say that our european allies, who are also fighting and dying, canadians, more canadians proportionately have fallen in afghanistan than americans. %$* 568
so there are a lot of people working to make this go. %$* 568
first— %$* 568
john. %$* 569
john. %$* 569
john %$* 569
the afghan police are dying because they’re hiding in their police posts and the taliban are surrounding them and killing them. %$* 569
our soldiers and marines go out on patrol, and i talk to these guys, they are afraid of the afghans betraying them, of shooting them in the back. %$* 569
it’s happened again and again, they can’t get the afghan army to fight except for a few commando units. %$* 569
may i— %$* 567
you know, and there’s, there’s— %$* 569
steve clem—let’s bring in your— %$* 13
—there’s a point at which— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
—your fellow teammate— %$* 13
—you’ve gotta give— %$* 569
—steve clemons. %$* 13
a colleague of mine and steve coll’s, peter bergen, who would no doubt be arguing on the other side of the panel, made an interesting point the other day in that the tragic death of these i believe 10 troops that were killed in an external outpost— the similar thing had been done in the past and there were hundreds of pages of review documents by the us military done to sort of prevent exactly what happened, that there was supposed to be pre- positioning of men—of equipment and a concern that this not replay. %$* 567
this gets at the issue i’ve been getting at, it is regardless of the merit of what you would like to try and achieve, the costs of the collective failure of the counterinsurgency approach of the months that have been under the obama— i mean the obama administration came in in a period where, the concern for upgrading of the forces at that time was linked to the spring offensive. %$* 567
then there was the increase of 21,000 troops to make afghans safe, afghanistan safe for voters, and we needed to get will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) through the august 30th elections. %$* 567
and then we see dire predictions of the meltdown of afghanistan, again you— we see a constant tick up, but no real serious competence in either generating a consistency of what objectives we’re at, whoever you talk to in the administration, if it’s dod one day, state another usid on another, they’re not on the same page. %$* 567
and then we have the tragic death of these soldiers, in something where the military had studied and not deployed the reforms it said it needed to do— %$* 567
all right, let’s bring in— %$* 13
it’s a mess. %$* 567
let’s bring in james shinn who’s already said he doesn’t really like your argument that the administration isn’t managing this thing well— %$* 13
well, as a former member of the bush administration i will allow you to take on the obama guys as much as you like. %$* 570
i would take on the bush administration as well, they had seven years of this. %$* 567
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 567
james shinn responding— %$* 13
but the issue is not whether it’s 20,000 troops or 10,000 more troops, it really is, and on this point i have to agree with the colonel, it’s a matter of time. %$* 570
you’re interested in counterinsurgency, how long did it take to succeed in malaysia? %$* 570
the british you mean? %$* 565
the british. %$* 570
yeah, it was a long time. %$* 565
long time— %$* 570
and this is an interesting place too because you— %$* 565
12 years, and he did prevail, right? %$* 570
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 570
they, they did prevail but you have to, you know perfectly well that this was an occasion in which the number of communist terrorists as they called them, was quite small, they were confined to a particular despised ethnic minority, and the conditions were all there to—all you had to do was hold on long enough and keep after them and you were going to get them. %$* 565
but as i said before, this was a small-scale problem. %$* 565
afghanistan is not a small-scale problem in terms of applying a general counterinsurgency strategy to this place because it involves economic development, political reform, and counterguerrilla operations. %$* 565
and those are all very complex things, and it’s going to be very expensive over a long period of time. %$* 565
well it is, it is big and it is complex and it will take time. %$* 570
but the risk here i think, is that the counterinsurgency clock moves at a slower pace than the political clock. %$* 570
the real question is, do we have the foresight or the strategy if you want to use steve clemons’s phrase, the strategic vision, to actually stay the course long enough so you achieve the objectives. %$* 570
or rather, you simply sacrifice your interests and walk away. %$* 570
yeah but this is a democracy, right? %$* 565
i mean, at least we think it is will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) anyway. %$* 565
and in fact, what’s going to happen here is, if you remember the history of the late, great war in indochina, 40 years ago, after the application of a great deal of counterinsurgency effort in the last two or three years of the war, and in fact, and the christmas bombing up at north vietnam, there was an armistice that lasted for two years, you were there during that period, in fact. %$* 565
and in fact, there was—did not a thing happen until, the people of the united states over some hiccup in world events then, told their members of congress that they wanted a law passed to prevent this happening again, and the congress passed a law that said not under any circumstances would the united states ever assist south vietnam again. %$* 565
the other side, understandably understood that as a signal. %$* 565
right? %$* 565
so, a year or so later or six months or whatever it was, they took their eight splendid divisions and they took a provincial capitol, and that was the end, everything fell apart. %$* 565
so the question— %$* 568
now why wouldn’t something like that happen again— %$* 565
john, john nagl. %$* 13
so the question is not, whether the united states can succeed in will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) counterinsurgency, the question is whether we have sufficient national interests to necessitate that we bear the burden over the number of— %$* 568
no. %$* 569
—years that will be required— %$* 568
no— %$* 569
—to do so— %$* 568
—the question is— %$* 569
ralph peters— %$* 13
—can the us succeed in counterinsurgency. %$* 569
john %$* 569
in that manual, you love to wave around, you did what bad academics do, you took a couple examples that supported your thesis, and ignored 3,000 years of history. %$* 569
there is nothing in that manual about religious motivation and religious war. %$* 569
and i will just tell will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) you. %$* 569
we’re having a—we’re pretty comfortable in this auditorium tonight. %$* 569
it’s easy to have this intellectual debate. %$* 569
but it’s really to an extent a moot point because the army and marines are out of troops. %$* 569
they are tired. %$* 569
they are worn. %$* 569
this isn’t an abstract issue. %$* 569
in order to send 40,000 more troops to afghanistan on what i believe is a fool’s errand %$* 569
based upon history, we would have to send some troops directly from iraq to afghanistan. %$* 569
now we’ve been at this for eight years. %$* 569
we’ve had some great successes in targeting al-qaeda and smashing them. %$* 569
we’ve—that makes sense in terms of our security. %$* 569
but teaching better dental hygiene to afghan villagers does not persuade the arab terrorists in al-qaeda to stop attacking america, and america’s interests, so john, no, i do not agree that we can succeed in counterinsurgency. %$* 569
we are not necessarily better than the brits, who had tried it for over 100 years, or even the soviets. %$* 569
i need to see the proof that we can succeed, before send more— %$* 569
ralph, i— %$* 568
—of our troops, to die for your theory. %$* 569
ralph %$* 568
with great respect, none of the troops are dying for my theory, they are dying to keep america safe. %$* 568
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 568
they are dying to keep the karzai government in power. %$* 569
they are fighting for the legitimate government of afghanistan, we don’t know—yet know what government— %$* 568
the ques—hey, guys— %$* 567
the legitimate government of afghanistan—? %$* 569
—we don’t yet know which government that is— %$* 567
legitimate to who— %$* 569
all right, all right, i need to separate this, because i want to bring in steve clemons. %$* 13
i mean i—i hope that— %$* 567
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
—we— %$* 567
steve clemons— %$* 13
—i mean, binary debates, are always complicated but i hope we can stay away from sloganeering, i’m not there—the other day general david patraeus said that one of his concerns, was that people would think that what happened in iraq would be easily moved— that he thinks all the time about the tyranny of the mind, that one would get stuck in one framework that might not approach the others, so general petraeus actually raised many of the same questions that we are about the applicability of the counterintelligence—but let’s take your manual for a minute, your manual as you know, and i’ve learned a lot about it from you, argues for a forced deployment which is staggering, but more important, of that staggering force deployment it argues that of the resources deployed, 80 percent of those should be civilian, 20 percent should be military. %$* 567
and i have to tell you that everything we see percolating out of the military analysis is calling for a 99.999 percent military approach to this. %$* 567
that only animates pashtun tribalism, pashtun concern over occupation. %$* 567
it animates and it has built a blob, which we’re increasingly calling the taliban. %$* 567
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) we’re not able to defuse that, and we’re not able to get the convertibility. %$* 567
i’ve talked to various people that— %$* 567
steve, you obviously haven’t read %$* 570
general mcchrystal’s assessment. %$* 570
because he says right in there, that it’s as much politics and economics, that it is military. %$* 570
i have read a significant portion of it— %$* 567
he acknowledges that— %$* 570
—but i— %$* 567
—it’s not a kinetic exercise— %$* 570
well, i’ve read the whole thing. %$* 565
the— %$* 565
this is patrick lang. %$* 13
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 13
the-- %$* 565
he talks so much about the need for good governance in afghanistan and about the woeful deficiencies of the present setup which is based really on traditional norms of government in afghanistan and throughout the region in fact. %$* 565
you know, then after a while you begin to wonder if he thinks in fact that karzai is in fact reformable, or will have to be removed and replaced with somebody else. %$* 565
all right, i want to at this point go to the audience for some questions. %$* 13
and we have people around the hall with microphones. %$* 13
and if you’re called on, i just want to urge you to hold the microphone about a fist away from your mouth so that we can hear you and the radio can hear you. %$* 13
and while the microphones are getting out i just want to take one last question to steve coll, in that i heard from your opponents’ side early in the opening statements, the remark that in the case of afghanistan there is no nation to build, and i want to ask you is that true and is that relevant. %$* 13
it’s false and it is relevant, it’s the heart of what i was trying to argue about afghan partnership in this and the evidence, the clear evidence of afghan resilience expressed continually despite our will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) errors and our underinvestment. %$* 566
you know, to talk about the afghan army not showing up is to suggest that we made adequate investments, adequate commitments, to that project. %$* 566
in fact 80,000 afghan soldiers go out and fight, put their lives on the line every day. %$* 566
you know, you’ve got incidents that you haven’t documented or described about fragging and for that you describe the entire institution as a failure, that’s just, i don’t understand how you can argue that, that the %$* 566
president obama ran for office signaling that this is what he intended to do, he argued that the bush administration had taken american resources, attention and potential, and invested it mistakenly in iraq, and that he was going to right that balance by turning back to finish what the bush administration failed to complete in afghanistan. %$* 566
he’s been in office for less than a year. %$* 566
and how do—how you reach a comprehensive judgment about his potential in performance, at the same time that you believe that the preservation of the constitutional afghan state is of american national interest, you’re arguing we should stay, you’re not arguing we should go. %$* 566
so, i think this is achievable— %$* 566
well— %$* 565
—in that— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 566
you know, i— %$* 565
—you’re basically— %$* 566
i’d like— %$* 565
—we’re basically arguing for the same state, and we’ve gotten off onto a sidebar about counterinsurgent, rural— %$* 566
no— %$* 565
—counterinsurgency— %$* 566
all right, i’m going to— %$* 13
—topics and so forth. %$* 566
i’m going to go—patrick, i’m going to go to some audience questions, now remember my rules about questions. %$* 13
i need them to have question marks at the end. %$* 13
we really want will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) them to be questions. %$* 13
and we would like them to be as close as possible to relevant to our topic tonight, ma’am? %$* 13
my name is michele steinberg, i’m from washington, d.c., with eir news service. %$* 571
first to mr. %$* 571
nagl and cole, i have a two-part question, one %$* 571
at a recent counterinsurgency conference at the national press club and also at the kerry committee, i think it was mr. %$* 571
biddle, they were talking about figures of 400,000 or 600,000 troops to carry out this counterinsurgency. %$* 571
on closer examination it was, a large part of those would be afghanistan soldiers. %$* 571
but that is enormous, and we need a comment for this audience about that, secondly, mr. %$* 571
coll, what you defined as success, i’m rather stunned about. %$* 571
to prevent a government of the taliban in afghanistan %$* 571
and to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of taliban or al-qaeda or mumbai terrorists in pakistan being the definition of success, is so minimal %$* 571
that there must be many paths to that other than four to six—400 to 600,000 troops. %$* 571
okay, thank you— %$* 13
please comment. %$* 571
thank you, steve coll, take that question. %$* 13
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 13
well, i think you’re right, i deliberately laid out what i thought the minimal us interests were, and i don’t think that anyone believes that 400 or 600,000 troops are necessary to achieve those, in fact, i’m quite sure that they’re not. %$* 566
ultimately, it may be that the combination of afghan soldiers and afghan police required to provide afghan-directed security to afghans, will be in that range. %$* 566
but there’s certainly no need to fight a war, today, or any time soon with american or combined troops of that size. %$* 566
in fact that’s not the plan, the plan is to hold the footprint of the cities with a much smaller force, and to challenge the taliban, preserve the afghan state long enough to build afghan security forces and police, that can in time under the direction of their own national leadership, complete this project, and, ultimately it will be afghans themselves who’ll decide how many, what size army and police deployed in what way is necessary to provide the security they require. %$* 566
this figure, to answer it, i’m sure john’ll want to say it is a mathematical calculation that actually has no bearing on us planning or policy. %$* 566
it’s basically a ratio figure that some academics use to describe what is the ratio of troops to population that is ideally required, and i’m not even sure that it’s universally accepted as the correct ratio. %$* 566
sir, your question. %$* 13
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 13
yes, my name is dennis cole, i’m neither from a news service or have any expertise in the subject so i find this very interesting.— %$* 572
as long as it’s a question that’s okay. %$* 13
it’s a question. %$* 572
i understand the arguments that you’re— that some of the sides have been making or one side have been making about the karzai government that we’re supporting, or maybe we’re defending. %$* 572
either we’re engaging in nation-building or we’re defending a government that might be corrupt, et cetera. %$* 572
but, from a, from just a layman’s perspective, i put myself in the shoes of the president of the united states. %$* 572
it seems to me that the question that the president has to answer, and the question that each of you have to answer, is, we are in the middle of a war, we do have threats. %$* 572
and, we, on one hand if we exit afghanistan or if we pull back from afghanistan and pakistan, we in my mind would suffer— that we would increase the probability of attacks here in %$* 572
in the united states, on the other hand, if we stay there clearly we’re going to continue to lose young americans so you have, a loss of life— %$* 572
i don’t mean to be rude, i just want you— that’s—i think where will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) you’re going— %$* 13
so the question is if you had to make a decision between continuing to lose young americans in afghanistan and pakistan to try to win, to try to succeed, or if you had to suffer the higher probability of losses here in america, what would you choose. %$* 572
it’s a terrific question— %$* 13
yeah, can i get this— %$* 569
um— %$* 13
the taliban did not attack us on 9/11. look %$* 569
you— again, we’re obsessing on real estate. %$* 569
this is a leona helmsley strategy. %$* 569
al-qaeda’s not interested in real estate except as a place to duck and cover. %$* 569
we need to remember why we went to afghanistan in the first place. %$* 569
afghanistan, i disagree with steve coll, it’s not a nation, it’s an accident of where other people’s borders ended, and here’s the key thing to take away from this part of it. %$* 569
first of all, we’re very successful against al-qaeda, and no one up here is arguing we have to pull out, it’s not either/or. %$* 569
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) we’re—i’m arguing and others are arguing, do you want to get back to focusing on america’s enemies, which is much cheaper, more effective, and %$* 569
just briefly. %$* 569
we are repeating the last war in afghanistan. %$* 569
the surge, the surge. %$* 569
what happened in afghanistan although the surge helped, was that al-qaeda was a foreign invader. %$* 569
we were too. %$* 569
but al-qaeda was so monstrous, that they alienated millions of muslims. %$* 569
and when the sunni muslims decided that they were—al-qaeda was a much more horrible and threatening foreign invader than we were, the game was won. %$* 569
in afghanistan, the taliban are the home team. %$* 569
again, say what you want— %$* 569
but ralph—i think the— %$* 13
people are dying— %$* 569
—i think the question was, if the taliban returns to hosting in their hotel, al-qaeda, would we rather have—have the deaths there or here and i think it’s a good question— %$* 13
well, that doesn’t connect. %$* 569
that just doesn’t connect— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 569
well, let me just— %$* 567
al-qaeda was trying to— %$* 570
ralph, can we get another voice— %$* 567
let’s, let’s let steve clemons in— %$* 13
mullah—mullah—wait one second, mullah omar was trying to get rid of bin-laden for over a year before 9/11, osama bin-laden wouldn’t go, there’s a lotta bad blood. %$* 569
don’t assume that the taliban equals al-qaeda. %$* 569
steve clemons. %$* 13
i think that it’s dangerous, and sometimes counterproductive to look at questions and just in binary terms, that either you stay and you produce outcomes, you leave and you produce great consequences. %$* 567
sometimes those scenarios, there are probably, steve coll and i talk about this, six or seven different scenarios that, i think for the sake of the health of american society we ought will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) to talk about more systematically, in what you can achieve, but some things that i would put on the table because i respect all the gentleman on the other side is that sometimes, we look very blindly and with an interesting kind of confidence about the ability of the us military to sort of earnestly and proactively go and create and shape outcomes. %$* 567
but it reminds me of trade deficits in economics, where frequently we look at gdp growth, we tend to not look at the current account deficit. %$* 567
we tend to look at what we generate and we tend not to look at some of the negatives and draw down. %$* 567
and what i fear is that there’s a blind spot in a lot of this discussion, about the down-side consequences of the size of the military footprint, in places that are very, very hostile to the narrative of colonialism, control, and that we don’t think about other ways to achieve some of the goals we might want to do, and so the question is efficacy, and actually getting efficacious outcomes, what i said about richard holbrooke. %$* 567
i was in a briefing with richard holbrooke and i can’t talk about the substance of it, other than i can talk about, he is doing some absolutely fascinating things, in a whole broad variety of areas but one of the area’s in agriculture. %$* 567
moving a lot of the poppy-growers into other areas. %$* 567
you can sort of look at transparent, tangible results, changing the sort of lives and direction but, let me tell you— %$* 567
but steve, what do you want to do though— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 570
—just quickly, let me—jim, let me just finish. %$* 567
the taliban today, are delivering to their people, and this is a problem for us, accountability in political management. %$* 567
courts, property rights, security, trade, ombudsmen. %$* 567
they are miserable on human rights, you would never want to be a woman living in those areas, and i think that it’s a night— it would be a nightmarish life on other fronts but in terms of the priorities people have, they’re there. %$* 567
i talked to a dubai businessman the other day who was telling me— %$* 567
steve, i want to—i want to bring jim in— %$* 13
yeah. %$* 567
well— %$* 567
so what do you want to do, steve. %$* 570
i mean i appreciate your encomiums for richard holbrooke— %$* 570
i want to seriously pull back— %$* 567
—i used to work for richard holbrooke— %$* 570
yeah— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 567
—at the state department, and i have observed him in action. %$* 570
but what do you want to do. %$* 570
do you want to split the difference? %$* 570
do you want to muddle through? %$* 570
so glad you asked— %$* 567
what national interest do you want to achieve in afghanistan and how are you going to do it— %$* 570
let him—let him answer, answer the question— %$* 13
so glad i was asked, what i would like to see first of all is for the administration, the obama administration to get itself all on one page, and decide what it is about and what it’s achieved—trying to achieve. %$* 567
that clarity has been absent. %$* 567
i think with all due respect to barack obama, whom i supported as well, barack—the concern that many of our allies have had in this is that barack obama’s eye has not been on the afghanistan ball since march. %$* 567
it is now. %$* 567
and i look for informed leadership, particularly since he’s reading steve coll’s book. %$* 567
but let me tell you what i said, i intimated some of the other things that need to be done. %$* 567
we need to make this not an will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) american war in afghanistan, it needs other major stakeholders, and not just nato. %$* 567
there are— %$* 568
if they don’t come in— %$* 567
—there are 41 countries engaged in this fight with us— %$* 568
i know, this is a george w. bush line, but china’s not there, russia’s not there, there is not the broad stakeholders that i think matter— %$* 567
this is the broadest coalition in history— %$* 568
it’s an important symbolic partnership, but when it comes to the substantive, pushing the needle on what’s going on—i don’t want to denigrate anyone else’s role-- %$* 567
it is not enough. %$* 567
again this is not about, sloganeering, it’s not about-- %$* 567
that i’m trying to make an assessment that the kind of weight that you need, consequential weight, to basically try and create an equilibrium there, remains absent. %$* 567
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 567
there are 41— %$* 568
and let me add— %$* 567
—countries involved in the effort, to prevent al-qaeda from returning to afghanistan and to help the afghan people %$* 568
build a better life. %$* 568
7 percent %$* 568
john, 41 countries— %$* 567
only 7 percent of the afghan people support the taliban, well over 50 percent of the afghan people want the americans to— and the international community to be providing them with security. %$* 568
the afghans i’ve talked to don’t want americans to leave, they want more of us there and they want us to do this better, and they in particular want us to build a big enough afghan army, so that someday they can leave. %$* 568
they want us to leave, but not yet, because they know what would happen to them if we did. %$* 568
john, there are 193 nations in the world— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 567
steve, i have to stop— %$* 13
—you can play numbers games— %$* 567
— i just need to stop you because i need to do a little bit of a break for radio which will take about 20 seconds. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we’re in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator, and we have six debaters, two teams of three who are debating this motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan.” and i want to go to the—there’s a woman who has already been %$* 13
got the nod a little while ago— there you are. %$* 13
and %$* 13
it’s a question, again, please. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 573
are they ready? %$* 573
yes, it’s a question, um, my name’s tricia degennaro, i’m an adjunct professor here in the global affairs department. %$* 573
and also this question is for both sides. %$* 573
i’ve been to afghanistan quite a bit and thank you very much because you both hit very much on the complex issues that are going on there and the decision to stay or go, or transition out. %$* 573
so within that context, how do each of you look at the mission which has not been defined yet, look at how to will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) better the command and control and collaboration or coordination on the ground, and, either if we transition out or stay there, we are going to need a better civilian service team there, and that we’re lacking, so i’d like you all to talk about that— %$* 573
steve coll, can you take that first? %$* 13
well, i’m—we’ve all read the mcchrystal report, but we don’t really know the answer to that very important question. %$* 566
i have my own idea, i think actually the other panelists have some ideas that are probably not as wildly far away as some of our tones suggest since none of them wants to turn around and leave either. %$* 566
certainly, the notion of supporting the constitutional afghan state by allowing it to build its own security forces more successfully than we’ve done so far, and by supporting the efforts that are already underway through the united nations, nato and others to bring, to keep the educational system that’s been build in afghanistan, i don’t know what the numbers are but, tens of thousands of girls and women are in school today in universities. %$* 566
you don’t have to go very far in afghanistan to run into them and to be inspired. %$* 566
and the idea that this is irrelevant to our presence in afghanistan or to our security, just strikes me as self-deceiving. %$* 566
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 566
patrick lang— %$* 13
but you—can i just answer— %$* 566
yes— %$* 13
—her question because she asked a very specific question— %$* 566
right— %$* 13
—about american civilian capacity, it’s a problem. %$* 566
the—hillary clinton has come into the state department and beaten every drum that i think she knows how to find to get the american civilian partnership that is called for in common sense as well as in counterinsurgency doctrine, better present in afghanistan. %$* 566
and i think %$* 566
she’s going slower than she wants, but, everyone who’s involved says within a year there really is an opportunity to improve performance, i hope so because it is a critical question, i’m glad you asked it. %$* 566
if i could just say— will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 570
i want to bring patrick lang in here, we haven’t heard from him in a while. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 565
the, i think there’s room, considerable room for agreement here, i mean i agree with steve coll’s idea that the—be a good idea to withdraw to the major footprint of the major towns. %$* 565
and because—but to try to improve the countryside across afghanistan is i think a visionary idea, as i’ve expressed before. %$* 565
but within those enclaves which contain a large part of the population, you know, you can do all these things that people want to do that are, are good and worthy projects such as the education of women and the improvement of daily life, all that kinda stuff. %$* 565
but in fact, you know, someone said earlier that you can’t go after the bad people unless you’ve got good and sufficient human intelligence. %$* 565
well, and that—you won’t be able to do that if they think you’re not going to pacify the country. %$* 565
well i don’t—i’m sorry, i don’t believe that’s true, you know, i was in the business of running human intelligence for the defense department for a long time. %$* 565
and in fact the way that you recruit spies, is—a variety of inducements often based on their peculiar psychology, each and every person, you know. %$* 565
and it’s a question of applied psychology in the field. %$* 565
so, the fact that you couldn’t acquire people, if you had a number of bases around in afghanistan you couldn’t acquire people that will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) you could use to penetrate enemy formations and then have enough troops on the ground, not the huge force of the troops, but some troops, augmented by the afghan national army, and using a lot of these tribal guys, who don’t like the radicalism of the taliban or wahhabi-inspired, absolute kind of islam that they don’t like, you know, you can go after enough of our enemies to disrupt them and keep them at bay, without having to try to take this whole country over, and to transform it into something that’ll be altogether different. %$* 565
i don’t—as i’ll say again—i just think that’s too big a task for us. %$* 565
have a— %$* 13
at this time. %$* 565
question down in the second row, sir. %$* 13
hello, my name is zack clements and i’m a student at nyu.and we were actually discussing this issue in class today a little bit. %$* 574
and i wanted to ask a little bit more about your endgame strategy for— we’ve defined success in the most minimalist terms possible. %$* 574
in a survey of 127 different countries during the cold war period it shows that, democracy and stability tends to decrease 20 to 25 %$* 574
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) percent post-intervention by a superpower. %$* 574
after we leave eventually, what institutions are we actually leaving behind, to prevent similar instability that we saw for the past 50 years. %$* 574
and then in that same vein, to what extent is the war on terror in general, a relic of the cold war, and is it necessary today for american security— %$* 574
okay, i—zack, i’m going to not use your second question because it’s really not to our point although it’s a interesting one we’ll put into a future debate perhaps. %$* 13
but your, but your first question, what institutions may be left behind, i’d like to go—i assume you’re putting that to the side that’s arguing that we can succeed. %$* 13
and any member of that panel can step forward. %$* 13
john nagl. %$* 13
the mcchrystal report advocates the creation of a very large and strong afghan army in order to enable an american departure, leaving behind a stable afghanistan that does not support terror, and that does not drag down the region, putting further burdens on pakistan and the other neighbors. %$* 568
that afghan army of some 250,000 which is roughly three times the afghan army today is something we know how to build. %$* 568
this is not something we’ve worked to build to date. %$* 568
the afghan army is undersized, only 80,000, about twice the size of the new york city police force. %$* 568
new will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) york city is a tough town, but afghanistan is tougher, and a whole heck of a lot bigger. %$* 568
so, until we start—and by the way right now today as we speak, we are only providing 50 percent of the advisors to the afghan national army that we say are required. %$* 568
we’re fixing that now, this is another one of the 4,000 additional troops president obama sent back in march are just arriving in country now, the fourth brigade of the 82nd airborne. %$* 568
so we need to build an afghanistan that can survive without us, and we are starting that effort now. %$* 568
we are eight years into this thing, we frankly %$* 568
but john, does that mean that you don’t actually know the answer to his question, what institutions %$* 13
no, the— %$* 568
—will be left behind. %$* 13
the afghan— the afghan institutions will be the afghan national army. %$* 568
that will be the single most important institution. %$* 568

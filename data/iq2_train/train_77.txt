that's a strategic stake for the united states and for britain and we've got to support this trend in the arab world and we've got to support the syrian people. %$* 285
thank you, nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where the motion being debated is: the u.s. has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
remember, you voted before the debate and you will vote again once after the debate, after you've heard the arguments and the team who has won more percentage points of your support when the debate is over will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing out this motion, the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
graham allison and richard falkenrath are arguing in support of the motion, no dog in the fight. %$* 13
they argue that syria just does not represent a vital u.s.interest, that the u.s.has no options before it that can lead to a desirable solution or a solution that would actually improve the problem, that there is no dog to pick in that fight, that the opposition fighting assad is so fractured that it's difficult to know who should get the arms and a lot of them are people who would not end up being our friends. %$* 13
they say this is not one where the u.s. should be leading. %$* 13
their opponents, nick burns and nigel sheinwald, say this is one where absolutely the u.s.must lead. %$* 13
the u.s.cannot sit this out, that it has a moral and pragmatic imperative to get involved for humanitarian reasons, for political reasons. %$* 13
they say that if assad wins our allies in the region are really going to be in trouble, and they say there is a political process already in place that represents the dog that the u.s.can ride on this, and should ride all the way. %$* 13
they are hopeful that it will ultimately produce results. %$* 13
i want to put a question to the side that’s arguing that the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
it looks as though what we have here basically to some degree is a disagreement about definition of terms. %$* 13
you have talked about not having a vital interest in getting involved in syria, and i want to put to you the question, just i think this allows us to go to some specifics, to look at some of what’s actually happening there, and ask you to tell us why that’s not vital. %$* 13
for example, as your opponents have pointed out, if syria melts away as a state, even if-- %$* 13
with or without assad, if it ends up being a chaotic place fueling and inviting a radicalization of a generation who would be our enemies, who would end up coming to this country with weapons, doing bad things to us, how is that not a vital interest, and why isn’t it? %$* 13
graham allison. %$* 13
a very good question. %$* 283
i think the u.s.is a global power. %$* 283
and i think-- %$* 283
if i go back to nigel's point just for a second-- %$* 283
the-- %$* 283
i think you set up a bit of a straw dog with the-- %$* 283
with respect. %$* 283
the notion that there's anywhere we don't care about-- %$* 283
excuse me, we care about things in 200 countries today. %$* 283
things happening everywhere impact u.s.interests. %$* 283
we don't sit with indifference for sudan, for somalia, for pakistan, for iraq, for any of the dozen wars that are going on now. %$* 283
but because the ability of u.s.-- %$* 283
both in terms of mind share and also capabilities is limited-- %$* 283
about each case, your question, john, is right-- %$* 283
the very right question. %$* 283
if syria melts down and comes to be three states or more chaotic than it is today, will this be horrible? %$* 283
yes. %$* 283
will it have bigger impacts on u.s. interests? %$* 283
of course. %$* 283
does it rise to the level of vital-- %$* 283
if this-- %$* 283
well, does it rise to-- %$* 13
such that-- %$* 283
does it rise to the-- %$* 13
does it rise to the level of justifying intervention? %$* 13
that's right. %$* 283
and you're saying it doesn't. %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
does it rise to a level of concern that would lead-- %$* 283
that would compel a responsible government to intervene militarily-- %$* 283
if that's the only way to resolve the issue? %$* 283
and i would say the answer is no. %$* 283
if syria melts down, this will be horrible. %$* 283
it will have impacts on lebanon, and on-- %$* 283
and on iraq, of course. %$* 283
it'll exacerbate the sunni-shi'ite division. %$* 283
of course. %$* 283
all those things are also happening before syria. %$* 283
could you-- %$* 13
if syria-- %$* 283
could you take-- %$* 13
i want to go to the other side, first, richard. %$* 13
but i just want to ask graham-- %$* 13
just take 15 seconds-- %$* 13
what would represent a threat to america's vital interests? %$* 13
just to put the marker out there. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 283
if we look to the year ahead, iran getting nuclear weapons. %$* 283
okay. %$* 13
let's go to the other side. %$* 13
who would like to respond? %$* 13
nick burns or nigel sheinwald? %$* 13
nick burns. %$* 13
well, i just say this. %$* 284
the question is-- %$* 284
who has a dog in the fight in syria? %$* 284
do we have one? %$* 284
do we care who wins and loses? %$* 284
well, nigel, can you-- %$* 13
you've-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
nick, you made that point in your opening. %$* 13
i just want to see if you can respond to-- %$* 13
i'm responding to-- %$* 284
i'm responding right now. %$* 284
yeah. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
sounds very familiar. %$* 13
good. %$* 284
you try to repeat your major themes. %$* 284
all right. %$* 13
fair enough. %$* 13
i'm really not trying to clash with you, and i-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we want you on our side, john. %$* 284
okay. %$* 13
i was addressing graham's point. %$* 284
and, you know, we are good friends and colleagues. %$* 284
and i think that graham and richard have raised some really important points. %$* 284
this is not an easy choice. %$* 284
in fact, it's really difficult. %$* 284
and generally, in my career, john, this answers the question. %$* 284
american presidents do not put american troops into harm's way unless it's a vital interest. %$* 284
but that's not what president obama's trying to do. %$* 284
he's not trying to put american troops into syria. %$* 284
in fact, he said he won't. %$* 284
and nigel and i are just arguing, because of the humanitarian interest, because of where syria is, its proximity to israel and other countries, because of the imminent victory of iran in a major power play, we need to be active with president obama's plan. %$* 284
but it doesn't have anything to do with vital. %$* 284
and vital is not in that question. %$* 284
and i think the key disagreement-- %$* 13
and both sides use this word-- %$* 13
was the word “lead.” and this side said this is not one where the u.s.needs to lead. %$* 13
this side says the u.s.needs to lead and quoting you, nigel sheinwald, you can't sit this out. %$* 13
so, i want to take that back to richard falkenrath. %$* 13
this question of leadership. %$* 13
there's a lot of information that's coming out of syria now, about what the people engaged are suffering from this fighting. %$* 119
actually, i think-- %$* 119
and as far as they're concerned, we're sitting this one out. %$* 119
i mean, there's-- %$* 119
there is-- %$* 119
they're very clear, the reporting out of syria is the u.s.is having no impact on the ground. %$* 119
in fact, the narrative looks more like al-qaeda is having an impact and hezbollah is having an impact. %$* 119
but we are not. %$* 119
the-- %$* 119
it strikes me, as you kn0w, president obama is stuck with no good options. %$* 119
and this will go down in history as a failure of his policy. %$* 119
but he's confronted only with options which make the failure even worse, because in order to really make an impact here, we have to make a difference on the ground. %$* 119
it's not enough to figure out who to write a check to or ship a bunch of light arms to. %$* 119
you have to figure out, who are we tipping the military balance in favor of so that there's a better outcome at the end. %$* 119
and we are not doing that at this time. %$* 119
but with your-- %$* 13
i don't want to say approval-- %$* 13
but you think that's the right choice at this point? %$* 13
yes. %$* 119
okay. %$* 13
let's take it back to nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 285
you're very good with the word yes. %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
i just think that richard's analysis is flawed and slanted in his favor, because the reality is that there is a political opposition in syria. %$* 285
it's fragmented, but there is a central group that's all of us in the united states, in europe, in the arab league are supporting and recognize an alternative government. %$* 285
and there is a group called the free syrian army that can channel arms and it could conceivably tip the balance quite quickly. %$* 285
just this week we've seen examples of the attempted assassination of assad. %$* 285
i'm not recommending that. %$* 285
but it happened. %$* 285
and we've seen continued taking of territory by the moderate and recognized groups. %$* 285
i accept that there is al-qaeda involved. %$* 285
there are a whole bunch of other groups involved. %$* 285
but that's been the situation throughout the middle east over the past couple of years. %$* 285
and in all those other areas, we haven't said that the tunisian president must stay. %$* 285
we haven't said that gadhafi must stay. %$* 285
we haven't said that mubarak must stay. %$* 285
we couldn't say that and accept that the will of those people is just going to be completely ignored. %$* 285
and that's what worries me about our opponents' position, that they are really arguing an old-fashioned view of realpolitik. %$* 285
keeping someone in power because it's the easiest option. %$* 285
all right. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
nigel, let me just interrupt you to give graham a chance to respond to some of your earlier points. %$* 13
so, graham allison. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 283
i think your-- %$* 283
nigel, what you're saying is persuasive. %$* 283
but-- %$* 283
okay. %$* 283
the free syrian army representatives and the opposition-- %$* 283
as rich said-- %$* 283
a lot of americans know them. %$* 283
these are guys that we meet in turkey. %$* 283
you don't see them fighting on the ground in syria. %$* 283
so, they're spending their time talking to folks like us, not having any control over 1,200 different groups who are fighting independently. %$* 283
chairman dempsey said last week-- %$* 283
in that-- %$* 283
or two weeks ago-- %$* 283
in very important testimony he says here, just a quote “about six months ago, we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition. %$* 283
now i want to say it's even more opaque.” %$* 283
okay. %$* 13
nick burns? %$* 13
just to point a fact-- %$* 284
the free syrian army is inside syria. %$* 284
it's commended by general salim idris, our colleague david ignatius of the washington post has reported on his activities there. %$* 284
it's the national coalition, the political group that, you know, goes around the world, raising money, trying to raise consciousness. %$* 284
i would just say another thing about general dempsey's testimony. %$* 284
all true. %$* 284
this is going to be-- %$* 284
if the united states were to get involved, it would be difficult. %$* 284
but president obama, his boss, is saying, “we're not going to put troops on the ground.” so i think the real question here that i wanted to address to rich and to graham-- %$* 284
and this is hard-- %$* 284
is it's certainly legitimate of you to say there's a risk in what you're proposing, a risk in action. %$* 284
but i think also the onus has to be on you to answer the question-- %$* 284
what is the risk of inaction? %$* 284
if we do nothing, do we suffer? %$* 284
do american strategic interests suffer? %$* 284
and i heard a little clap over there. %$* 13
that's fine, to do that. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
and again, as i said earlier, because we're a radio broadcast, it tells the radio audience that ultimately will hear this that you're all here. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
you don't have to overdo it, but it's not like a presidential debate, where you're not allowed and you have to sit on your hands. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
just so, that's fine. %$* 13
but it's a great question. %$* 13
and i think it's one we all want to actually hear this side answer. %$* 13
what is the-- %$* 13
what are the consequences of inaction? %$* 13
now, you've said already you don't think they're vital. %$* 13
but what are they? %$* 13
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
well, first, it's not as though we're inactive. %$* 119
we're doing something. %$* 119
it's just not making any difference. %$* 119
and there's two halves-- %$* 119
and this has been the case for a long time. %$* 119
i mean, this has been-- %$* 119
how long ago was it that president obama said he needs to go? %$* 119
assad needs to go? %$* 119
but there's two halves of the argument. %$* 119
the first is about vital national interests. %$* 119
and i think-- %$* 119
it seems to us that you agree with us, that it-- %$* 119
we haven't met that bar. %$* 119
but there's a second half, which is, you need to reasonably articulate a plan that gets you to a better place when you're done. %$* 119
and if you're unable to do that, then you are, by default, stuck with the bad consequences of inaction or of a policy that really isn't making much difference. %$* 119
and so, it-- %$* 119
in fact, the onus is on you to articulate an alternative plan that gets us somewhere-- %$* 119
when-- %$* 119
the interestingly-- %$* 119
you know, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff just testified to this effect for his confirmation hearing. %$* 119
and he basically said there isn't one. %$* 119
and he was-- %$* 119
he went through six different options. %$* 119
and he said, all of them-- %$* 119
none of them work. %$* 119
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
all of them are problematic. %$* 285
but of course, the chairman of joint chiefs supports the limited supply of arms to the syrian rebels that the president has authorized. %$* 285
so, he believes that that is a reasonable policy choice, which will not drag america in in the way that the other policy options he analyzed might. %$* 285
now, i think the issue is, is this any different from the other situations we've seen in the middle east? %$* 285
all very difficult. %$* 285
and in tunisia, you saw a messy political protests leading to an election and the election of a moderate islamist group. %$* 285
in libya, everyone rightly said, was chaos. %$* 285
but there was a transition process. %$* 285
there were elections, again, with a moderate islamist group elected. %$* 285
it's still very chaotic in libya, but we're all going to have to live with 10 or 20 years of unwinding of this extraordinary set of events in the middle east. %$* 285
we can't wait for that perfect moment to arrive. %$* 285
i want to put a question back to this side. %$* 13
it's saying that this-- %$* 13
u.s. has no dog in the fight in syria, the question was put to you, "what will be the consequences of inaction? %$* 13
" you parried with a question back to the other side. %$* 13
i allowed it to go. %$* 13
but i really want to know what your answer to the question is, the consequences of inaction. %$* 13
let's take a specific your opponents put to you, not rescuing this humanitarian crisis. %$* 13
nigel sheinwald in his opening statement said, "this is just going to look real bad." we talked, i mentioned earlier, rwanda, great regret about that. %$* 13
is it not significantly harmful to american interests and reputation not to be acting in the case of the syrian refugees and the killing that's going on there? %$* 13
and the answer is, of course it is. %$* 283
graham allison. %$* 13
and of course the u.s.is acting. %$* 283
i mean, let's be clear. %$* 283
who is the largest supporter of humanitarian assistance to syria today? %$* 283
the u.s.president obama announced last week another $195 million. %$* 283
we have a billion dollars, and we should be doing much more, and we should be raising much more from other parties. %$* 283
but, graham, the-- %$* 13
that-- %$* 283
i think the sense of the question is not strictly about blankets and tents. %$* 13
i think part of the question is bringing back, say, for example, the example of bosnia where a refugee crisis-- %$* 13
in addition to other things-- %$* 13
but a refugee crisis prompted very, very aggressive american action not just in the-- %$* 13
i think that's a good analogy, and i think in that instance there were very special circumstances. %$* 283
nick has actually written about this. %$* 283
and he and i agree on this. %$* 283
there were very special circumstances in which a limited u.s.military intervention made the difference at the margin to get to a better place. %$* 283
and i think that was a good example. %$* 283
in this instance, why is it different? %$* 283
we have an old professor that used to make a list where you draw it down the middle of the page, you say, "similar," and "different." the similarities in this case are superficial. %$* 283
the differences are profound. %$* 283
nick burns. %$* 13
i guess what i'm thinking is that, you know, i think president obama is faced with a very difficult choice. %$* 284
part of the problem is that assad is trying to frame the international debate, "it's me against the jihadists. %$* 284
you americans don't have a dog in the fight." actually, if you listen to the iranians and listen to russia, that's exactly what they're saying, "stay out, you don't have an interest." what we're saying is, "we're facing a complex environment there. %$* 284
there are al-qaeda groups, and there are jihadi groups." and richard knows more about this than anybody, he's right about that, but there also is the moderate element. %$* 284
the only way to help the refugees and people of syria is to support that moderate element. %$* 284
why should we want to see the jihadis and the syrian government to be the only people armed? %$* 284
we have to give these moderate rebels a chance. %$* 284
that's the basis of president obama's policy, which we support. %$* 284
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
richard, can you hold for just one second? %$* 13
after richard speaks, i'd like to go to the audience to begin getting questions from you. %$* 13
what will happen is the house lights will come up. %$* 13
if you raise your hand i'll call on you. %$* 13
a mic will be brought to you if you could stand up. %$* 13
you'll be recorded and filmed, so if you could just state your name and ask a question that's terse, that doesn't take more than 30 seconds or so, that really keeps on point, that gets these teams to debate on this matter. %$* 13
and i really will discourage you from debating with them. %$* 13
richard-- %$* 13
can we ask questions? %$* 18
no, you don't get to ask questions that far away. %$* 13
you can go sit in the audience. %$* 13
richard falkenrath, your response. %$* 13
this-- %$* 119
nick said a key term there, and i think their entire argument hangs on a very slender thread around the key term of "moderate opposition." and so we do, in fact, have a national coalition that was in december, not that long ago, recognized by the, quote, "friends of syria," as the place to send the money. %$* 119
but it is dominated by the muslim brotherhood, and it is essentially a playground for qatari, saudi, and uae-- %$* 119
and turkish influence peddling, that is internally divided, that has achieved notional external legitimacy, since someone has to get the money, but has no internal legitimacy. %$* 119
the free syrian army, our best hope for the moderate people on the ground fighting, is not integrated in any way. %$* 119
it's a loose umbrella of dozens of different fighting groups. %$* 119
and let's just be clear, our friends in the free syrian army, they were the ones who criticized us for deeming the al-nusra front a terrorist organization because they coordinate their operations occasionally and the al-nusra front bailed them out of a situation where they were about to get annihilated by the syrian army. %$* 119
so these are our friends? %$* 119
this is the moderate opposition and the dog that you think we have? %$* 119
i mean, this-- %$* 119
we don't get to pick the dominant post-assad faction in syria. %$* 119
response from this side before the questions? %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
my question back is do you think that, that representation of the opposition mirrors the syrian people. %$* 285
let's go back to the syrian people. %$* 285
let's think what caused them to go into the streets and to rebel and to risk their lives two and a half years ago. %$* 285
and i think the syrian people are basically moderates. %$* 285
there is a strong tradition of inclusiveness, indeed of a secular tradition in syria. %$* 285
we have to get to the point where those people are given the chance to express their point of view, and i don't think i have enough confidence in the way that people operate to feel that if they're given a choice they won't vote for extreme voices. %$* 285
i think you've over-caricatured the fragmentation and extremism of the opposition. %$* 285
i agree it would've been much better if we'd taken much firmer, concerted, and comprehensive action two and a half years ago when the-- %$* 285
extremists and islamist elements were much smaller than they are today, but i'm afraid the logic of what you're saying is give it another couple of years and it'll be much, much worse. %$* 285
all right. %$* 13
let's go to questions, please. %$* 13
sir, right on the aisle and, again, if you can stand up and tell us your name. %$* 13
mateo grodofola hi. %$* 13
my name is mateo grodofola i have a question predominantly for the side which is saying that we should, in fact, intervene in syria. %$* 13
given the way that large opposition groups like the free syrian army have brutalized and attacked a variety of minority groups, such as the kurds, the alawite, the christians, in syria, can they necessarily be deemed to have a moral high ground ? %$* 13
are they the good guys? %$* 13
have they disqualified themselves from our support? %$* 13
nick burns, would you like to take that question? %$* 13
thanks for the question. %$* 13
what we are proposing, and what president obama is doing, is not proposing a military intervention in syria. %$* 284
we're proposing an intensified effort by the united states to rally international support for those moderate elements. %$* 284
are they perfect? %$* 284
no. %$* 284
but compare them to the other side, to the outside government using artillery against civilian neighborhoods in damascus and aleppo and other syrian cities, razing homs and hama. %$* 284
bashar al-assad did that as his father did in 1982. so, there's a big difference between the syrian government and the moderate rebel forces, and in that relative light they are the good guys. %$* 284
but do we need to be concerned about, as the questioner asked, the nasty stuff they've done? %$* 13
i mean, deeply concerned? %$* 13
sure we do, and as i said before, neither of these sides are pure, but there is a difference. %$* 284
and, you know, i think that what all of us are struggling with is that, you know, there is a risk of doing things and there are a lot of risks involved in what we're proposing, what the president's doing. %$* 284
we just think if we do nothing the status quo continues. %$* 284
the real victims of that will be those 6.8 million syrians who've lost their home or lost their job or can't live in the way they want to live. %$* 284
and so they're the people we've got to keep focused on. %$* 284
on each of these questions i'll give the other side a chance to jump in if you want to or we'll go back to questions. %$* 13
graham allison. %$* 13
very briefly, i think the question was right on target, and i think to nick-- %$* 283
we're not doing nothing. %$* 283
nobody's proposing doing nothing. %$* 283
as i said before, we're the largest humanitarian assistance being provided. %$* 283
we're trying to work with the neighbors. %$* 283
the u.s.military is currently in jordan and turkey trying to prevent the spread of the violence. %$* 283
we're currently trying to work with an international coalition to get negotiations going. %$* 283
we've been trying to get a peace negotiation in which the russians would be co-hosting some negotiated outcome, which is our best hope. %$* 283
all those things we're doing, not successfully i would say, so the question is if it continues in this way with the killing and all the other things that we find as negative impacts for us, if it's so important to us, that if the only way to secure our interests is military intervention, we should do so. %$* 283
and we think the answer is, unfortunately, no. %$* 283
i do want to put the question to this side is there a level that this thing would reach where you would justify-- %$* 13
where you would support military intervention? %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
well, i think that if you saw an extraordinary collapse in the situation in syria, if you saw the chemical weapons getting into hezbollah's hands or al-qaeda's hands, then those exceptional circumstances would, i'm sure, cause the united states and cause its allies to think again. %$* 285
i don't think there'd actually be any difference between us on that. %$* 285
i think we're looking more at the situation today, whether it can be allowed to continue and ours is a very, very strong advice is that it can't. %$* 285
okay. %$* 13
another question. %$* 13
sir, right down in front here. %$* 13
people who are farther back, i have a bias towards the front of the room because i don't see that well. %$* 13
so, if you're vigorous with your hand waving, i'll see you and i'm not joking. %$* 13
sir, please. %$* 13
stefan edlis stefan edlis my question has to do with the israeli-syrian border. %$* 13
for the last 30-- %$* 13
perhaps longer years, this has been the most quiet border in asia, in europe, wherever you can see it. %$* 13
how can it be in israel's interests when the assad regime collapses, the sunni majority will become jihadists, how can that be in israel's interests? %$* 13
well, let me ask you, sir, if i can rephrase the question, because our motion is really what's in u.s.interests. %$* 13
are you identifying u.s. interest in israeli interests in this case? %$* 13
stefan edlis how can that be-- %$* 13
u.s.-- %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
fair enough. %$* 13
stefan edlis-- %$* 13
amend the question-- %$* 13
how will that be in the u.s. interests? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i'd like to put that first to the side that is arguing that the u.s. should have a dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 284
nick burns. %$* 13
i think that american and israeli interests are identical. %$* 284
and they have been for a long time on the golan heights. %$* 284
and you're right. %$* 284
the curious, ironic thing was that the assads kept the peace with israel and-- %$* 284
on the golan, between 1967 and two years ago. %$* 284
but the problem the israelis have now, strategically, is that that assad regime is significantly weakened. %$* 284
and it looks like-- %$* 284
you know, assad had some tactical victories in the last couple of months. %$* 284
he suffered two defeats in the last week. %$* 284
he cannot control his country any longer, so the israelis can't bank on that. %$* 284
what we have to hope is that moderate elements in the syrian opposition will emerge victorious, the kind of people who will understand they have to keep the peace with israel as well in the future. %$* 284
that's the basis, i think, of what president obama is trying to do. %$* 284
richard, do you want to take that? %$* 13
only-- %$* 13
i'm only asking you because we haven't heard from you in a bit. %$* 13
or you can seek your partner. %$* 13
graham allison. %$* 13
this is a-- %$* 283
it's a great question. %$* 283
and i was talking to one of the leaders in the israeli national security community, who's a good friend of mine, last week. %$* 283
and so, i asked him just your question. %$* 283
does israel have a dog in this fight? %$* 283
and he says, “absolutely not.”let's be clear if there's this transfer of advanced arms by the syrians to people who are fighting israel, like hezbollah, we are acting-- %$* 283
and we're acting now-- %$* 283
so, israel has attacked half a dozen times, particular instances of transfer. %$* 283
but he said, our official position and our operational position is we will not intervene in the civil war. %$* 283
that's the quote. %$* 283
another question? %$* 13
ma'am? %$* 13
emma rubsax i feel this has moved very quickly-- %$* 13
will you just tell your name-- %$* 13
us your name, please? %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
emma rubysax oh, yeah. %$* 13
emma rubysax i feel that this has moved very quickly from dog to feasibility. %$* 13
so my question is about feasibility. %$* 13
you mentioned the peace talks which have been stalled. %$* 13
and to what extent can increased intervention from the friends of syria and the united states give both sticks and carrots to give russia-- %$* 13
particularly-- %$* 13
an incentive to get assad to the table and negotiate a transfer which might provide some opportunity for those moderate elements? %$* 13
nigel sheinwald. %$* 13
well, i think this-- %$* 285
particularly the united states-- %$* 285
have tried that with the russians, over a long, long period, to get them to change their position sufficiently to get assad seriously to the negotiating table. %$* 285
and it hasn't worked so far. %$* 285
i'd have to say, in the present state of u.s.-russian relations, doesn't look more likely to be more successful, you know, in the weeks and months ahead. %$* 285
i fear that the only thing that will get assad to negotiate or allow his team to negotiate is a change in the situation on the ground. %$* 285
and i think this is where we do differ, the two teams here. %$* 285
we're saying there are things that can change that situation on the ground. %$* 285
and the rebels say themselves, they want more american and international support. %$* 285
they want the arms from the united states. %$* 285
they want the arms from qatar and from saudi arabia and elsewhere. %$* 285
and they believe that with them, they can tip the balance, change the situation on the ground sufficiently to put assad and his regime under pressure and start a negotiation. %$* 285
and the opposition in syria isn't saying that assad-- %$* 285
the whole regime cannot be part of the negotiation. %$* 285
they're saying, we can't negotiate with assad himself, but we're not going to do what happened in iraq. %$* 285
we're not going to banish the whole of the regime, the whole army, the whole public service. %$* 285
we're going to negotiate with the people around assad, form a transition, and then let the people decide. %$* 285
all right. %$* 13
and i think it's conceivable. %$* 285
richard falkenrath, it's part of your argument is that the undogworthiness of this battle is the impossibility of any of these things coming to being-- %$* 13
or the near impossibility. %$* 13
what's your response to the scenario just laid out? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 119
first nigel is correct that in order to get a negotiated settlement with assad, you do need to change the situation on the ground. %$* 119
you do need to change the balance of military power in one way. %$* 119
in fact, it has changed in the last year in two ways-- %$* 119
hezbollah entered in force from lebanon. %$* 119
and al-qaeda entered in force from iraq. %$* 119
not us. %$* 119
and so, i think the basic diplomatic premise is correct. %$* 119
you need to shift the military balance in such a way that it is in their interests to achieve a negotiated settlement. %$* 119
now, that's-- %$* 119
the problem with that is that's what we call a proxy war. %$* 119
and so, it is a recipe for entering a proxy war in syria, not just against assad, but against al-qaeda. %$* 119
and so, proxies are what we do when we want to change the military balance in a country but don't want to be there ourselves. %$* 119
and so, you are left with no alternative on your side of the debate if you do want to change the ground-- %$* 119
the situation on the ground but to engage in a proxy war in syria which the military analysis-- %$* 119
which is not favorable to that case. %$* 119
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters-- %$* 13
two teams of two-- %$* 13
debating this motion: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
i can go to another question, but nick barnes, i don't know if you wanted to respond to richard. %$* 13
i thought that i saw that you-- %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
no. %$* 284
i think richard-- %$* 284
go ahead. %$* 13
nick burns. %$* 13
has addressed the central question-- %$* 284
does it concern the united states that iran is rising to power in the middle east? %$* 284
a victory by assad is a victory for the mullahs in tehran. %$* 284
therefore, it's in our strategic interests to push back. %$* 284
we choose not to push back with american troops on the ground. %$* 284
but if we can push back by weakening assad and by supporting the moderates and making it more likely than not that the moderates will succeed and be victorious eventually-- %$* 284
that's a defeat for iran. %$* 284
so, a lot of what we're doing here is trying to counter and limit iran's inroads into the heart of the middle east. %$* 284
sir, in the far back, in the white t-shirt? %$* 13
steve began thank you. %$* 13
my name is steve began and i have a question for both panels. %$* 13
we're actually talking about a very complex issue that's playing out before us. %$* 13
i think the real test of each of your positions is going to be in the outcome. %$* 13
and so, what i'd ask you to do is look forward to a potential outcome. %$* 13
if your position prevailed - - and we aren't talking about getting in-- %$* 13
intervening or not. %$* 13
we're talking about degrees of intervention, really, here, i think, between the two panels. %$* 13
if your degree of intervention-- %$* 13
if your position prevailed, what outcome, within realism, do you think would be most favorable for the united states interests? %$* 13
that's a terrific question. %$* 13
i'd like to put it first to the side that's arguing the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
if you-- %$* 13

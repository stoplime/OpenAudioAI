and so, it's an important balance to know when is it okay to use the surrogate measure and when isn't it? %$* 296
it's not always okay. %$* 296
and we just need to get more thoughtful and astute about that. %$* 296
sir? %$* 13
front row. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is edgar. %$* 18
i think a recent-- %$* 18
relatively recent case was the drug of avastin. %$* 18
and it was a drug that was unanimously declined by fda.and yet, there were a few patients that showed great promise. %$* 18
i mean, they really responded well to this. %$* 18
and yet, under the old paradigm of chasing p-values, a statistical term, it just was disregarded. %$* 18
so is it-- %$* 18
could it be the case that the low-hanging fruits that fit the old model of statistics are done with and that maybe we should be looking at newer models? %$* 18
i mean, computation power is basically free now. %$* 18
why not move in a new direction? %$* 18
do you-- %$* 13
and do you feel that you hear them-- %$* 13
well, just for clarity-- %$* 13
do you feel that you hear this side saying they don't want to move in any new directions? %$* 13
i feel like this side is saying, keep the status quo. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
no. %$* 296
to be clear, i don't think we're saying that. %$* 296
i think we're saying both-- %$* 296
jerry avorn. %$* 13
me and david challoner, and the approval of devices, and in my case, the approval of drugs, there's a lot of exciting possibilities for looking at genetics, for looking at molecular markers. %$* 296
we're totally in favor of that. %$* 296
and i think one of the most important misstatements made by the other side is that fda doesn't want to look at this and doesn't care. %$* 296
fda very much is trying to look at this. %$* 296
they just want to get the science right. %$* 296
so it's a myth that the fda is-- %$* 296
so-- %$* 13
not willing to consider-- %$* 296
so jerry, what is it that you want to hold onto that you think they want to get rid of? %$* 13
i want to hold onto a careful view of the science, because to not get too statistically wonky, i think it's pretty clear that if you just give, you know, a sugar pill or garlic or anything to a bunch of people with cancer, there will be people who get better, because sometimes people's cancers get better no matter what. %$* 296
and what is at risk here is the idea that that tail of the curve that may have nothing whatever to do with the substance, because we see in-- %$* 296
with placebo, someone's going to say, “ah ha! %$* 296
that's the subgroup that needed to have this drug, even though there's no molecular basis for believing that.” there's always going to be some people who get better from a bad disease with placebo, because that's the way-- %$* 296
keep my question, because i kind of lost it. %$* 13
what is it you say that you want to hold onto that they want to get rid of? %$* 13
i want to hold onto having a high standard for when a biomarker or a surrogate measure or another assessment of a drug is accepted as really being scientifically true. %$* 296
and you think that they're not-- %$* 13
well, i think the fallacy in the other side's argument is that there's always going to be people who get better no matter what you do. %$* 296
and if you attribute that to a drug, you're going to approve a lot of drugs that not only aren't helping people-- %$* 296
because those same people-- %$* 296
answered on their own. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
you know, i think the issue is about caution and risk. %$* 295
and embracing these new kinds of technologies takes a certain degree of risk. %$* 295
and it takes people at the agency outside that comfort zone. %$* 295
and where i think we're arguing is that the agency is just not willing to embrace the risk; they're wedded to a very old model of doing things. %$* 295
and they haven't moved out of their comfort zone. %$* 295
sure, they have pilot programs. %$* 295
i started the critical path initiative with dr. %$* 295
mcclellen. %$* 295
but they haven't progressed, because ultimately, the leadership can talk about these ideas and does, but when it filters down to the review level, the reviewers ultimately feel uncomfortable moving outside the established models and taking the risk that it would take to adopt those kinds of innovations. %$* 295
so it's the cultural thing you mentioned earlier. %$* 13
look, and i-- %$* 296
look-- %$* 296
you can change the culture, but you have change the structure of the process. %$* 295
could i add-- %$* 101
one loophole-- %$* 18
let peter-- %$* 13
let peter say something, then you, and then we’re going to wrap. %$* 13
in the white house report that i mentioned, they described the it systems inside the fda, that they are woefully inadequate. %$* 101
they are-- %$* 101
the systems don't connect among offices, okay? %$* 101
they have incompatible protocols. %$* 101
and they are still resorting to entering data manually. %$* 101
now, i don't blame this on any individual at the fda, but that's what happens to large, bureaucratic structures in washington; they are an information industry and they can't-- %$* 101
you know, they're working with clay tablets and donkeys, really. %$* 101
it's ridiculous. %$* 101
jerry avorn. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
i completely agree, as one of the authors of that presidential report. %$* 296
i totally endorse what you said. %$* 296
one of the difficulties fda has is that folks who were intent on reducing the size of big government and taking away the budget that government-- %$* 296
agencies have, some of who may be on this stage-- %$* 296
that-- %$* 295
make it impossible-- %$* 296
make it impossible for an agency like that to move into the-- %$* 296
forget about the 21st-- %$* 296
into the late 20th century, because they don't have the budget. %$* 296
you need to be able to fund governmental entities to do the work that they need to do, not just say the marketplace will take care of it. %$* 296
and that's part of fda's problem. %$* 296
that-- %$* 13
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
now we move on to round 3.these will be short closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
speaking first to summarize his position against the motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health, jerry avorn. %$* 13
he is a professor of medicine at the harvard medical school. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jerry avorn. %$* 13
we've heard thalidomide mentioned a couple of times tonight. %$* 296
and i think that may be a good thing to remember as you vote and as you think about whether the fda's too cautious or not. %$* 296
before the thalidomide debacle, there were some amendments in washington that senator kefauver had put forward, saying that, in 1962, the agency ought to have the right to make a manufacturer show that their drugs actually worked. %$* 296
that was not a requirement in 1961; that was something which was being debated in the senate. %$* 296
and by all accounts, the kefauver amendments were going to go down in flames, because we had people saying, “oh, we can't let big government get between the doctor and the patient. %$* 296
we can't restrict the liberty of americans to take whatever they want. %$* 296
we can't have doctors' hands tied by having this government agency saying whether or not a drug is allowed to be sold for a given purpose.” right before the amendment went down in flames, it turned out that there were women who had children being born all over europe, japan, africa, with little deformities. %$* 296
and many of you have seen these pictures. %$* 296
instead of arms and legs, they had little flippers, as well as a lot of internal organ damage. %$* 296
and that was because the company was making a drug called thalidomide, called a lot of other things in other countries, as a sedative and anti-nauseant that was particularly marketed aggressively to pregnant women. %$* 296
and there was a reviewer in the fda named dr. %$* 296
frances kelsey. %$* 296
it was her first task to review this drug. %$* 296
she’s still alive, in her 90s, living in washington. %$* 296
and she said, “no, i don't think there's enough safety information. %$* 296
we don't need another sedative or anti-nauseant for pregnant women.” and almost singlehandedly, she caused the drug to not be available or to deny it to the american public. %$* 296
as a result, thousands-- %$* 296
perhaps tens of thousands of american kids were not born with these anomalies. %$* 296
that's changed around the legislation-- %$* 296
fda was given the power in the wake of the thalidomide crisis to say, “yeah, you’ve got to show that your drug is safe and effective before we're going to let you sell it.” i don't think we want to go back to a pre- thalidomide era by weakening the fda. %$* 296
thank you. %$* 13
jerry avorn. %$* 13
our motion is the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, scott gottlieb. %$* 13
he's a former fda deputy commissioner. %$* 13
i want to come back to that drug for hunter's disease, elaprase, i talked about at the outset. %$* 295
when that data from that study were released, the results were impressive. %$* 295
patients getting the drug could walk 44 meters farther in five minutes than before getting the drug. %$* 295
by comparison, most of the children on the sugar pills showed no improvement and many saw their condition worsen. %$* 295
science daily, at the time, relayed the experience of 16-year-old cody paxton, one of the first patients enrolled in the trial. %$* 295
and he said, quote, “my breathing is better and i'm more energetic,” unquote. %$* 295
and he said he could put his hand behind his back, which he couldn't do before receiving elaprase. %$* 295
most of the patients forced to take that placebo, however, saw their joint disease worsen and advance, making future treatment much more difficult. %$* 295
i'd like to say that the kids who got the placebo would regain all the function they lost during that trial, but many would not. %$* 295
i'd like to say that companies are still developing drugs for these enzyme disorders, but no new companies have entered this space since that time. %$* 295
and only one subsequent drug has been approved for any of these diseases. %$* 295
and i'd like to say that the fda reviewer in charge of imposing the elaprase trial isn't handling drug reviews anymore, but he's actually been promoted and now sets drug review policy for the entire fda. %$* 295
fda reviewers are not oblivious to the human cost that we talked about here tonight. %$* 295
but the culture they operate under isn't suited well to minimizing them. %$* 295
by implementing a few key reforms, some of which we've talked about tonight, and modernizing the science of regulation, fda could modernize its culture and improve its ability to keep americans both healthy and safe. %$* 295
thank you. %$* 13
scott gottlieb. %$* 13
our motion is "the fda's caution is hazardous to our health,” and here to summarize his position against the motion, david challoner. %$* 13
he is vice president emeritus for health affairs at the university of florida. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 297
the conversation tonight is obviously focused very highly on pharmaceuticals and not devices. %$* 297
and i understand the reasons for that. %$* 297
but my comments at this point actually would, i think, in the end, help both processes, as long as the fda was an active, engaged organization. %$* 297
most voluntary reporting of problems on drugs or devices by patients, the public, the media, health professions, healthcare organizations such as clinics and hospitals, generally first go to industry and then go from industry to the fda.legal counsel at many of these organizations are loathe to report due to liability concerns for their own client. %$* 297
what does get to industry is supposed to be reported to fda, but some estimates put the data that fda receives as reflecting only 1 to 2 percent of adverse events that actually occur with devices and drugs to the fda.moreover, these anecdotes are not informed by any knowledge of the denominator of the report. %$* 297
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. %$* 297
therefore, i would like to say that as things are managed currently, for now, you must reject the premise that the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 297
thank you, david challoner. %$* 13
and that's our motion: the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, peter huber. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
in the form of arguments for and against this motion, i actually believe only one thing, that we-- %$* 101
the best thing for our health is to get the very best drug science we can possibly develop, and the rest will take care of itself. %$* 101
and i-- %$* 101
and i have been lamenting, in case you haven't noticed, the fda's dreadful failure to move molecular medicine systematically into its protocols. %$* 101
and it's had 20 years to do this, you know, and to tell us that they're working on it, you know, it's too late now. %$* 101
when they're done, vote for the other side. %$* 101
but for tonight, you know, vote for our side. %$* 101
but let me-- %$* 101
i would like to give you just a taste, which blew my mind when i read this, of the incredible new powers that medicine acquires once it begins doing molecular medicine, you know, from scratch, thinking mechanistically about what drugs actually do. %$* 101
true story: six-year-old emily whitehead was on-- %$* 101
you may have read this in the times. %$* 101
you know, was on the brink of death after a two-year battle with leukemia. %$* 101
her doctors extracted from some of her cancerous cells some signature molecules and moved them into some of her healthy immune system cells. %$* 101
exactly as planned, they went in a-- %$* 101
into a wild attack on their cancerous siblings, so wild that they overproduced a molecular-- %$* 101
an immune system signaling molecule, a cytokine. %$* 101
one of her doctors knew that an arthritis drug, of all things, controls cytokines. %$* 101
he prescribed a massive dose. %$* 101
emily-- %$* 101
the icu staff gathered to sing happy birthday when emily awoke from her coma on the day she turned seven. %$* 101
the times ran her story just before christmas, and emily is healthy to this day, and cancer free. %$* 101
we should be simply appalled, you know, that, you know, intense molecular tracking and learning on the fly and measuring everything you possibly can in sight during clinical trials isn't an-- %$* 101
i mean, isn't just the norm today rather than an exception you have to go through to-- %$* 101
a special rule to even find. %$* 101
what are we thinking when we tell the doctors, you know, to put on blindfolds and do no adaptation, no significant learning during the trials? %$* 101
the diseases that are probably going to kill you, and you, and you, and me, and the people we love are going to require complex arrays of drugs, you know, prescribed in complex ways. %$* 101
we have to do molecular medicine. %$* 101
the fda isn't doing it. %$* 101
peter huber, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 101
and that concludes our closing statements, and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued best. %$* 13
most persuasively. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to go again to the key pads at your seat and look at this motion and vote. %$* 13
the motion is "the fda's caution is hazardous to our health." if you look at that, and it rings true for you, push #1.if you look at it, and after hearing everything, you don't buy it, push #2.and if you became or remain undecided, push #3.and you can ignore the other keys; they're not live. %$* 13
and you can correct a key press just by pressing the next one, and it'll be-- %$* 13
it'll work out for you. %$* 13
so we'll have the results in-- %$* 13
in about a minute and a half. %$* 13
but before we get there, a few things i want to say. %$* 13
and the first thing i want to say is i really want to say congratulations to what the debaters did here tonight in a debate where-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
it was really clear that this was a debate where there was a very, very deep fault line between those two sides. %$* 13
and yet they came to it with respect. %$* 13
they knew each other's work. %$* 13
they were intelligent. %$* 13
and that's our goal here. %$* 13
so one more time, thanks to all of them for that. %$* 13
and also, i have to say that sometimes it's a little bit tricky with audience questions. %$* 13
tonight, there wasn't a clunker at all. %$* 13
you were great with the questions. %$* 13
and thank you, everybody who has the courage to get up and ask a question. %$* 13
so congratulations to you. %$* 13
also, the doctor who brought up the term "big pharma," i was thinking of stirring a-- %$* 13
you know, setting off this evening with a drinking game every time the words "big pharma" were mentioned. %$* 13
but except for you, we'd be a pretty sober crowd at this point. %$* 13
it didn't happen to come up. %$* 13
we'd love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
the twitter handle-- %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us.our hash tag for tonight's debate is #fda.this is the final debate of our spring season. %$* 13
however, on june 19th, we're going to be in washington, d.c.we're partnering with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
the motion then is this: “cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies.” so we-- %$* 13
oh, i really want you to come down for that, yes. %$* 13
you know, we'll charter a plane to get you down for that. %$* 13
so make sure to visit our website. %$* 13
we're going to be back in the fall, still here at the kaufman theater, we're pleased to say. %$* 13
you can see on our website how to buy tickets and what we're doing. %$* 13
we're at www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
but i just want to go through the topics we think we're going to be doing. %$* 13
we're going to be looking at drones; we're going to be looking at breaking up big banks; the case for going vegan; we're going to look at gun control; and we're going to take on immigration. %$* 13
that's what the plan is now, so it's going to be a great fall. %$* 13
we hope you'll all be there. %$* 13
tickets go on sale in late june. %$* 13
and for more information, you can go to our website and pick up tickets. %$* 13
i've mentioned this already, but for those who can't join our live audience, there are a lot of other ways to see these debates. %$* 13
we stream live on fora.tv, so everyone who is watching on fora.tv right now, hi. %$* 13
and you can listen afterwards to this debate on npr, wnyc here in new york, on pbs stations across the country. %$* 13
that's also channel 13 here. %$* 13
and check your local listings for air dates and times. %$* 13
all right, so we had you vote twice on this motion: the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
after voting twice, according to our rules, the team that has moved the most percentage points to its side will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
in the first vote on this motion, the fda's caution is hazardous to our health, 24 percent of you agreed with the motion, 32 percent were against, and 44 percent were undecided. %$* 13
that's a very big undecided. %$* 13
so those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, it's the team that’s-- %$* 13
numbers have moved most in terms of percentage points that will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's go to the second vote. %$* 13
first, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote is 53 percent. %$* 13
that's the team that's saying that the fda is too cautious. %$* 13
they went from 24 percent to 53 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 29 percentage points. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against this motion, their first vote was 32 percent-- %$* 13
their first vote was 32 percent. %$* 13
their second vote, 38 percent. %$* 13
that's up only 6 percent. %$* 13
it's not enough. %$* 13
the debate goes to the team that was arguing that the fda's caution is hazardous to our health. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

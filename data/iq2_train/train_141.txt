that did not exist under zia. %$* 411
that did not exist under the dictators that ruled, the military dictators that quite frankly were backed by the united states, like these gentlemen want us to do. %$* 411
let's hear from these gentlemen. %$* 13
and that did not exist at all. %$* 411
daniel pipes. %$* 13
we don't want to back the dictators. %$* 413
can i make it any clearer? %$* 413
we are not arguing for dictators. %$* 413
we are not arguing to extend their rule. %$* 413
we are arguing that we can influence them in a positive direction. %$* 413
i would love to see the dictators gone. %$* 413
i have an idea on who can replace the dictators. %$* 413
again, right up against the rear wall there. %$* 13
yeah, thank you. %$* 13
yeah, yeah. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
i was going to say the guy wearing the black shirt, but that would be like-- %$* 13
i'm black shirt, i'm just wearing one. %$* 18
my name is ben. %$* 18
i'm an englishman in new york, like the song. %$* 18
i have a-- %$* 18
my heart is with brian and reuel, but my head at the moment is with daniel and zuhdi. %$* 18
reuel you made a passing reference to france. %$* 18
and that got me thinking, the french-- %$* 18
the french spring of 1789 was followed by 200 years of war, revolution and genocide. %$* 18
i'm getting worried on this question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
and i'm coming to the question. %$* 18
i'm getting excited, actually. %$* 18
i hope so. %$* 18
there are decades to go. %$* 13
so i'm not going to go through the full 200 years. %$* 18
i've just-- %$* 18
how are you-- %$* 18
are you-- %$* 18
are you convinced that we can somehow avoid a repetition of that pattern in the middle east? %$* 18
because you planted those doubts in my mind by saying that. %$* 18
reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
i think the best answer to that is, and the simplest one is, revolutions are bad. %$* 410
you don't want to have a revolution. %$* 410
you don't want to have the violence that comes with a revolution. %$* 410
what you want to have is the transition that goes through elections. %$* 410
you want to avoid, at all cost, the triumph of the military men, the militarists, the-- %$* 410
i would say in the middle east, the real danger in the middle east still in most places is not the islamists. %$* 410
it's actually still the military. %$* 410
in that you want to have folks become responsible for their faiths as quickly as possible. %$* 410
there's only one way you do that. %$* 410
there's only one way people become responsible, and that is through elections. %$* 410
it is process of elections. %$* 410
i mean, take iran. %$* 410
iran has just - - they've had controlled elections. %$* 410
but the simple fact of having controlled elections in iran has inspired people to actually take them seriously. %$* 410
there was a promise in the islamic-- %$* 410
when the shah fell, there was the islamist strain under khomeini, and there was also the democratic strain. %$* 410
they are in constant tension. %$* 410
and i would argue that actually the democrats have done far better in at least taking the intellectual train. %$* 410
but this does not make you an iran fan. %$* 13
no, i'm-- %$* 410
to the daniel's point is that nobody likes anybody. %$* 13
no, i'm not a fan of iran. %$* 410
all i'm telling you is that it the iran case is very interesting is because it shows evolution. %$* 410
it shows, as we saw in the soviet union and eastern europe, you can have lots of fallen communists. %$* 410
the notion that daniel is suggesting that in fact islamists stay as they are is false. %$* 410
it's all depending upon the political circumstances. %$* 410
no one stays as is. %$* 410
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
i think the central fulcrum of their argument is somehow that the voting booth, that the election process, that once these citizens enter a voting booth, they somehow become liberals or democrats when, in fact, it's a mobocracy that they're advocating for, that somehow 50 percent-- %$* 412
we learned in this country we had to have a civil war and a civil rights movement until we understood what liberal principles were from our own constitution. %$* 412
so somehow they're telling us that elections are going to evolve this without a revolution. %$* 412
and the islamists will actually entrench it more. %$* 412
and i think again, you are insulting muslims to assume that the collectivist concept of islamism, that somehow all muslims must think alike, have the same political party, have the same aspiration for the state, that there's no left to right, that we are all part of this brotherhood party, which is islamism, is somehow freedom for muslims or otherwise we insult islam. %$* 412
there are a majority of muslims that don't islamists, don't want it on our back and reject the entire notion. %$* 412
i agree with that, and i don't know where that-- %$* 411
i agree with that, and i don't know where that straw man is sitting. %$* 411
the chair's not here. %$* 411
i mean, that-- %$* 411
i agree with that notion. %$* 411
is the straw man. %$* 412
all right. %$* 13
i haven't gone to the back yet. %$* 13
the woman in the red dress. %$* 13
would you mind - - can you see that-- %$* 13
i know it's dark back there. %$* 13
would you like her to step into the light a little bit? %$* 13
i just like the idea of the woman in red. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
or walk toward the light, ma'am. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
couple years ago there was a debate on iq squared about how radical islam taken over muslims, the muslim religion. %$* 19
and the debate people here voted that it had which i thought was interesting. %$* 19
not knowing a lot about it, it seems as though at the fulcrum of the issue, question for you is, will elected islamists actually allow any evolution into democracy happen, or will they suppress it? %$* 19
that seems to-- %$* 19
because i think we all like the idea. %$* 19
it's just, will it practically happen? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
that's a question for this side for the motion. %$* 13
reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
we don't know until it happens. %$* 410
i mean, you can't know this in advance. %$* 410
there is no way right now that we can be certain that you're going to have many elections in egypt and tunisia and where else democracy spreads to. %$* 410
that is going to be, you know, trial by error or by experiment so-- %$* 410
but unless you get there, you'll never know. %$* 410
so you have to go down that path before we can even answer that question. %$* 410
now, i can give you a religious discussion of this, how i think on the shiite side and the sunni side, how western ideas about democracy have penetrated that can give you some hope there. %$* 410
but i-- %$* 410
we just don't know until it happens. %$* 410
reuel doesn't know. %$* 413
reuel doesn't know, but i do. %$* 413
oh, daniel, you could have just left it there. %$* 13
it was perfect. %$* 13
i was trying to help you out by going to another question. %$* 13
but go ahead. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i'll go to another question unless you really-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it landed so well. %$* 13
sir, yeah, thanks. %$* 13
a mic will come to you, halfway up the aisle. %$* 13
hi, my name is patrick mcginnis. %$* 18
i just wanted to return to mr. %$* 18
pipes comment, suggestion about america's place in this process. %$* 18
i think, you know, i would be very happy if america could through its intervention bring about liberal democracy in the middle east, and maybe in a time of american hegemony that would've been possible, but our nation building efforts in the middle east over the past 10 years have been very difficult. %$* 18
so based on the experience we've had, i guess i'd like to return to what you said and put it in a practical context. %$* 18
yes, the effort's in iraq and afghanistan have been, will have been, i believe, failures, you can come back in five, 10 years to iraq and afghanistan, you'll see the barest traces of the vast american engagement there. %$* 413
it will have been a failure, so, yes, i agree with the premise of your question, but i'm not calling for invasion and putting in rulers and so forth. %$* 413
i'm accepting the fact that there are autocrats. %$* 413
and i'm saying, "okay, let's use our influence in a constructive way to make it easier for our kind of people who are there to gain in strength to be important and eventually to lead the middle east out of the mire in which it is today," but i'm not calling for invasions. %$* 413
right, so-- %$* 13
and i'm all in favor of that because i spent five years of my life in the middle east working with liberals, with people pushing for human rights, working for women's rights in the west bank, in gaza, in egypt, across the region. %$* 411
and i'm in favor of it, and i think it's a nice idea. %$* 411
and i was against the war in iraq, but the reality is-- %$* 411
and this is what we're debating tonight is that good intentioned americans who want to go in peacefully and try to orchestrate the politics of these places won't produce the sorts of results that you expect. %$* 411
what you need is the rough and tumble, the jousting that reuel talks about. %$* 411
we can help. %$* 411
we were trying to help with the tools of, "how do you organize? %$* 411
" and i think this is a fundamental struggle in the next wave of egypt because there will be a next wave. %$* 411
the islamists swept in this first round of elections. %$* 411
there's still a lot of uncertainty about the constitution, but there'll be another round of elections. %$* 411
and i do believe that american, european, and other organizations have a role to actually support these groups to become better organized. %$* 411
that's not what we're arguing. %$* 411
we're not arguing for elected islamists. %$* 411
we're opening-- %$* 411
we're arguing for open politics in these places, and it doesn't come by invading these countries, and it doesn't come by simply trying to negotiate with some of these dictators and say, "please open up."it comes through an organic process, a political process, that what reuel and i are saying that in the first waves are likely going to lead to elected islamists-- %$* 411
but that's not going to close off the debate. %$* 411
it's going to open it up and lead to multiple centers of power in these countries. %$* 411
another question? %$* 13
sir, down in front. %$* 13
like to-- %$* 18
i-- %$* 13
we just need to get the mic to you, thanks. %$* 13
i'd like to bring you back to the agreement-- %$* 18
can you just-- %$* 13
would you mind identifying yourself? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
okay, constantine canacledes i'm with scholars for peace in the middle east. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
both sides indicated that they agreed that both choices of elected islamists, dictators, were heinous, they were totalitarian, et cetera. %$* 18
there was a distinction made early on, and that wasn't addressed, that the same repressive regimes can operate, but one tends to operate local and local- regional, and as the against side indicated that there is a vast globality of vision and intent on the part of islamists, that they have a vision that goes far beyond the periphery and the boundaries of the state-- %$* 18
nation and state. %$* 18
and that wasn't addressed, and so i'd like this side, pro side, to address, "isn't that a valid distinction that, that would suggest a far greater potential for ill on a global level from islamic fundamentalists and elected islamists and-- %$* 18
can i restate the question and-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
make sure that i'm understanding what you're asking? %$* 13
you're saying-- %$* 13
you're asking about the point that dictators are working from one state. %$* 13
islamists are a part of a global worldwide aspiration to control many, many states-- %$* 13
a mission, yeah. %$* 18
and you want the side arguing for the motion to address that? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
i think it's highly likely that if you have more than one election, that what you're going to see-- %$* 410
and you always see it with democratic politics, is that your aspirations become much more localized. %$* 410
and i don't think that you're going to see any caliphate. %$* 410
i think the notion of that is a bit farfetched. %$* 410
i think it runs against the most successful western export to the middle east which is nationalism which has profoundly affected even islamist movements throughout the area. %$* 410
so i don't think that's a big problem. %$* 410
now, you could find common purpose. %$* 410
it's entirely possible that you will have islamists in one country look fondly and affectionately at islamists in another country and seek to support them. %$* 410
that's-- %$* 410
what's the oic? %$* 412
what's the oic, then? %$* 412
what is that? %$* 412
it's a mess. %$* 410
i mean, the-- %$* 410
wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
term of art. %$* 13
explain the oic. %$* 13
the organization of islamic cooperation is 56 countries that share nothing other than the fact that they have majority muslim countries and also the fact that they rejected the u.n.declaration of human rights, and many of them say they signed in, which they did, but then they signed the cairo declaration that talks about blasphemy laws, apostasy, et cetera. %$* 412
so it's based out of saudi arabia, and they don't seem to be critical of one another. %$* 412
well, that's because the primary-- %$* 410
the oic is really about them saying, in a rather childish way, you know, "here we are; here we are. %$* 410
notice us. %$* 410
we're not the west, et cetera, et cetera." the oic is-- %$* 410
has been, in the past, sort of a concoction of dictatorships that, virtually, the only thing they could agree on is how much they dislike the united states, how much they dislike the israel, and other, you know, less concealed forms of anti-semitism. %$* 410
it's-- %$* 410
i don't really see that the oic actually has anything to do with the democratic process. %$* 410
it has a lot to do-- %$* 410
it's sort of like an islamic version of the united nations, which i don't recommend. %$* 410
i don't think it's a moral paragon. %$* 410
most of the time, it's not very serious. %$* 410
let me-- %$* 13
we have to wrap-- %$* 13
we have to wrap up this section. %$* 13
and i just want to bring up a topic that i thought would come from the audience, and it didn't, and we don't have much time, so i want to ask it very quickly to this side. %$* 13
we haven't heard very much about the issue of women's rights. %$* 13
you all acknowledge that, at this point, most islamist movements are not friendly to women's rights in the way that we would understand it. %$* 13
and i want to ask this side, you know, where do you draw the line on that? %$* 13
where do you say, you know, it can be open and it can be evolving, but in the meantime, in the short term, this abuse of women's rights just cannot be tolerated? %$* 13
it's a red line, and i think we see the dictatorship of saudi arabia as one of the worst offenders of women's rights. %$* 411
and i think you see the places that have-- %$* 411
again, muslim majority countries, malaysia, indonesia, and other places with islamist parties-- %$* 411
respect for women's rights, like everything else. %$* 411
in places like morocco too, where you have space for a discourse and a debate about this. %$* 411
and in morocco, they had mudawwana, a code to improve the status of women's rights. %$* 411
so a big debate is happening here. %$* 411
and i don't believe, for a moment, that the rights of women under saddam hussein were a lot better than what we have today inside of iraq. %$* 411
i don't believe that at all. %$* 411
and i think there's a fight that women, as long as they can go back to the ballot box, as long as there are institutions there, as long as there's accountability in the system, as long as women have a voice in those debates, i believe that you'll see, eventually, a more sustainable and legitimate foundation for women's rights in these countries. %$* 411
fifteen seconds. %$* 13
i have to say, when the dictator, when mubarak wants to control the women in his population, he uses the islamists. %$* 412
when the saudis want to control the women in their population, the islamist wahabis are the ones that they use to do that. %$* 412
so now all you're doing is you're elevating the judges and the teachers from their positions to run the whole country. %$* 412
i'm sorry; i'm not going to-- %$* 412
you know, i think we need to vote against the motion, as a result. %$* 412
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is, "better elected islamists than dictators." and remember, this is-- %$* 13
we're now going to go to closing statements, and this is their last chance to persuade you of the power and the quality of their arguments. %$* 13
but before that, i want to remind you that you voted beforehand. %$* 13
immediately after the closing statements, you will be asked to vote again, and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
but first, on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and speaking first, against our motion, "better elected islamists than dictators," daniel pipes, president of the middle east forum. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 413
the word checkmate in chess comes from persian, "shah mat," which roughly translates to the shah, meaning the king, is defeated. %$* 413
now, there was a shah who was actually defeated in 1979.he was thrown out by khomeini and the islamists. %$* 413
and what's so striking, in retrospect, is how many westerners greeted this event with rapturous excitement. %$* 413
for example, the deeply influential french philosopher michel foucault called ayatollah khomeini a saint. %$* 413
in this country, jimmy carter's ambassador to the united nations, andrew young, made a little less of a statement, called him "some kind of saint." well, look how things turned out. %$* 413
iran is today the rogue state along with north korea, par excellence. %$* 413
it's government is despised by three quarters or more of the population. %$* 413
it is the leading terrorist state in the world, terrorist sponsoring state in the world. %$* 413
its nuclear plans make it the single greatest menace to world peace today. %$* 413
so looking back to 1979 and calling khomeini a saint, expecting things to be better, i would suggest to you not to make them-- %$* 413
the same mistake, not to put your faith in islamists. %$* 413
expect the worst of the islamist regimes. %$* 413
these are people who are not going to let go of power. %$* 413
one man, one vote, one time or maybe two times is what you can expect. %$* 413
and therefore i say, better the greedy dictators that we can push around that we can change than the islamist dictators who are our deepest enemies who we cannot change, who will be there for decades to come, who will inflict enormous damage on their own populations, be aggressors toward their neighbors and deeply mired in anti- americanism. %$* 413
thank you. %$* 413
thank you, daniel pipes. %$* 13
our motion is "better elected islamists than dictators." and here to speak in his position, closing statement on the motion, reuel marc gerecht, a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 13
you know, i think daniel started off by talking about tactics. %$* 410
and i have to say this is the part i simply don't understand. %$* 410
i mean, he says we have dictators to push around and make evolve. %$* 410
but we've-- %$* 410
they didn't evolve, and we did push them around. %$* 410
i don't understand how you actually make a dictator become-- %$* 410
allow liberals to win in a democracy and deprive everybody else. %$* 410
i mean, would that were possible. %$* 410
but it's not possible. %$* 410
doesn't actually make any sense. %$* 410
if liberals are going to triumph, they're going to have to triumph in a free election sometime. %$* 410
you're not going to be able to hold off an election and know-- %$* 410
you only get to have that election when you know that they are going to win. %$* 410
and until that moment, you can't have the election. %$* 410
now, i think that's a recipe that any dictator can look at and say, i think i'm a dictator for life. %$* 410
and i think i have to be honest here. %$* 410
i think that's what daniel is saying too. %$* 410
i think what he is really saying is it's just too big a risk, so we're just going to have to keep the dictators more or less forever because unless you actually are tested at the urns, you're never going to know how popular you are. %$* 410
and i would suggest to you it's only by being tested at the urns that you're actually going to begin to develop a liberal framework, a liberal process that makes sense. %$* 410
it's only by defining yourself against those who are not liberal that you're going to be able to gain votes. %$* 410
i don't see how in the middle east, where the region has been defined by faith, increasingly so under dictatorship, that you get to imagine a scenario whereby suddenly, through american pressure, intelligently applied, of course, because americans always apply pressure intelligently, that you are going to create a liberal order without coming to the ballot box and testing yourself. %$* 410
thank you, reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
our motion is "better elected islamists than dictators." and here to summarize his position against this motion, zuhdi jasser who is president of the american islamic forum for democracy. %$* 13
even before we said a word, our opposition was trying to paste us with the dictators. %$* 412
and at the end, i think if you look at the poster children for islamists, which is really the question in this motion, the poster children for the islamism movement are the muslim brotherhood. %$* 412
and look no further than their emblem. %$* 412
not their emblem in english that says, "freedom and justice" and all those good words that we want to hear, but the words in arabic and under it in arabic, it says, and that's the beginning of a passage in our koran that refers i think to something else, but it refers to, if you look at the translation, "hence make ready against them whatever force and whatever mounts you are able to muster so that you might deter thereby the enemies of god who are your enemies as well." that is on the emblem of the brotherhood in arabic. %$* 412
their motto, "allah is our objective, the prophet is our leader. %$* 412
the koran is our constitution, jihad is our way, dying in the way of allah is our highest hope." they got elected, and they haven't seemed to have abandoned that motto. %$* 412
yet our opposition wants you to vote for a whim that somehow these demagogues, these islamist supremacists will abandon these ideas. %$* 412
and i haven't seen one piece of evidence that they have. %$* 412
in fact, when they. %$* 412
in fact, when they get in power, they smother the liberals. %$* 412
and i think if you believe that hope springs eternal, then you should vote for the side for the motion. %$* 412
if you believe that pessimism, that believing that islamists are not better, but that that pessimism will signal to the liberals on the ground that we are with them, that we will not support their new dictators, then ultimately you must vote against the resolution and against the motion. %$* 412
so many of our families have had it with dictators. %$* 412
don't push upon our communities new dictators using religious language and suits. %$* 412
true moderation demands the abandonment of islamism. %$* 412
you can't band-aid islamism. %$* 412
it's a supremacist ideology. %$* 412
and it's bigoted to assume that muslims and islam can't have a third path, that islamism is islam. %$* 412
and it's not. %$* 412
so you must vote against the motion if you believe in real hope, real hope for those on the ground, and that those dying in the revolutions did not die in order to give opportunity to new islamist dictators; they died for real liberty. %$* 412
thank you, zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
our motion is, "better elected islamists than dictators." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, brian katulis, who is a senior fellow at the center for american progress. %$* 13
this debate tonight has made me think a lot about the previous century and our century, the 21st century. %$* 411
and i think we see a worldview on contrast here. %$* 411
and when i hear our opponents tonight speak, i think about the 1950s in this country when we talk about -isms and communism and lump large categories of people under one big banner and say that this is an ideological crusade; we can't deal with them; we can't talk with them; they're all lumped together, and no matter what, you can't do anything about that. %$* 411
and i started out by saying that you-- %$* 411
we really have a choice here tonight. %$* 411
it's either to accept the reality, a reality that the dictatorships in the middle east and in parts of south asia have fostered the sorts of ideologies that led to the deaths of people in those societies and right here in manhattan on 9/11. %$* 411
and we've got a choice here today. %$* 411
we can stick with that old system that is crumbling, a system in countries that have a population where more than half of the population is under the age of 25.and change is coming, whether we like it or not. %$* 411
and we can pretend like the system of dictatorships that we see in saudi arabia or in iran or in other places, that we can work with them somehow and they'll open up, and that we'll actually whisper in the ear of liberals, and they'll bring about change in those societies. %$* 411
we can continue to pretend that that's the pathway forward. %$* 411
i believe that the rough- and-tumble jousting of politics in these societies are the only thing that's going to produce the sort of legitimate change that comes from within. %$* 411
it's going to take a long time. %$* 411
it won't be simple or easy. %$* 411
but i actually think we stick with the process of democratization as it's unfolding, or we continue on the current path that produces the sorts of extremists that we've seen. %$* 411
thank you. %$* 411
thank you, brian katulis. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements, and now it's time to learn which side you feel has presented the more powerful and highest quality argument. %$* 13
we are asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote, and we'll have the readout almost immediately. %$* 13
the motion is, "better elected islamists than dictators." we're asking you to vote a second time, and this time to vote on the quality of the arguments you heard. %$* 13
if you feel that the team arguing for the motion presented the better argument, push number one. %$* 13
if you feel the team arguing against presented the stronger argument, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remained or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys, and just correct your last vote, and we will have the results in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
i just want to say, about the quality of this debate we presented tonight, we've done-- %$* 13
i've done 46 of these now, and the question i'm most often asked is, "which was the best debate that you've ever seen put on? %$* 13
"i think this one is a contender. %$* 13
i really want to congratulate these guys for doing this. %$* 13

good evening, everyone, and welcome. %$* 1
i’m robert rosenkranz, chairman of intelligence squared u.s.debate forum, which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 1
it’s a very special pleasure for me to welcome you today to our inaugural debate of our inaugural season. %$* 1
with this series of live debates, and with our national radio audience, we’re pursuing a lofty and ambitious goal. %$* 1
we’re trying to raise the level of public discourse in american life. %$* 1
we see a congress that’s mired in partisan rancor, we see much of the media increasingly ideological. %$* 1
we see policy intellectuals in the think-tank world preaching to their respective choirs, and the discussion of contentious policy issues everywhere, dominated by intense emotions, rather than by facts and reasoned analysis. %$* 1
but intelligence squared is not about the search for bland middle ground. %$* 1
rather, we want to encourage each side of an argument to sharpen its own thinking by listening to opposing views, and responding to inconvenient facts. %$* 1
we want our audience, who voted on tonight’s resolution coming in, to vote again after hearing the debate. %$* 1
as our great judge pierre lebeau said, “you know you have a mind, when you change it.” whether or not you change your mind, i hope you’ll come away with the recognition that there is an intellectually respectable position on the other side. %$* 1
for that is the real point of our initiative. %$* 1
we want to promote a civil society in america that is truly civil—where we increase our respect for opposing views, we reduce our anger and emotion, and we call on the best within ourselves, as we confront the challenging issues of our day. %$* 1
we’re thrilled that wnyc is recording our series of debates, and that through national public radio, you’ll be able to hear this debate in most of the major cities across the country on local npr stations. %$* 1
my wife alexandra munroe commissioned the study that was the first concrete step in this initiative, and she has made invaluable contributions every step of the way. %$* 1
we value the sponsorship of the times of london, their support, and indeed the excellence of the debates themselves is part of a team effort. %$* 1
i want to especially thank our moderator robert siegel, the voice of “all things considered,” and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s event. %$* 1
but one individual merits special acknowledgement—our executive producer, dana wolfe, a former “abc news nightline” producer who brought extraordinary determination, intelligence, and experience to this project. %$* 1
thank you, dana. %$* 1
i’d like to close by quoting two political leaders, one american, one british. %$* 1
al gore, at the clinton global initiative last week, speaking on the subject of global warming as a crisis, said, “the debate is over.” and now, margaret thatcher. %$* 1
“i love argument. %$* 1
i love debate. %$* 1
i don’t expect anyone to just sit there and agree with me. %$* 1
that’s not their job.” well, at the risk of showing my own partisanship, i’d like to declare a victory for britain. %$* 1
of course oxford-style debate is a long and vigorous tradition in britain, and intelligence squared was founded in london, where it’s an esteemed institution and a major success. %$* 1
there it attracts a live audience of 800 of london’s most influential figures. %$* 1
i’m honored to welcome the founders, media entrepreneurs jeremy o’grady, and john gordon, and pass the microphone over to john, who will share his thoughts and introduce our moderator for the evening. %$* 1
thank you very much, robert. %$* 526
we’re absolutely delighted that intelligence squared has come to america thanks to the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 526
it’s great for the baby that jeremy o’grady and i have been nurturing for 25 or more years and that we created four years ago has now come over the pond. %$* 526
]intelligence squared in london has really taken off. %$* 526
everyone there loves debate and even though it’s very much part of our tradition, it’s not very much a part of the tradition in london-- %$* 526
there isn’t any regular series of debates other than intelligence squared. %$* 526
i hope this evening you’ll enjoy the two particular pleasures i think that we enjoy from the debate, one is that, this is probably the first time that you’ll have the opportunity to hear oratory. %$* 526
i mean there is very seldom—few outlets where you can hear somebody speaking for eight or nine minutes in trying to persuade you to vote for or against a particular motion. %$* 526
and i think the other great sort of pleasure of debate, which again i’m sure you’ll experience this evening—particularly if you’re undecided as to the motion—is the great pleasure of hearing the proposer arguing the motion, agreeing with them, and then eight minutes later actually agreeing with the other side. %$* 526
and it’s that intellectual ping-pong that is particularly exciting. %$* 526
we’ve been slightly surprised by the enormous take-up of intelligence squared, there’s been a vast amount of interest from companies around the world interviewing us, writing articles about it. %$* 526
it’s almost sort of emblematic of the stereotypes of various countries, for example the french who have written about it and interviewed us, are particularly surprised by the fact that the speakers who are normally extremely rude to each other in english debate end up going out to dinner with each other. %$* 526
the germans who’ve interviewed us twice and written an article in der spiegel, were actually surprised by debate, full stop. %$* 526
as a consensual society they’ve just never really sort of experienced the idea of debate. %$* 526
and the japanese, with whom we did an interview on tokyo fm very recently, a live interview to 20 million people, in the course of the interview it was clear that they completely misunderstood what we were doing. %$* 526
they asked us, how many people have gotten married during the course of a meeting. %$* 526
they rather thought we were a dating agency. %$* 526
so we’re rather curious to see how you are going to respond to this very quintessential british sport of adversarial debate. %$* 526
i’d like now to hand over the microphone to our very distinguished moderator this evening, robert siegel. %$* 526
robert is a senior host of national public radio’s award-winning evening news magazine, “all things considered.” he got started in radio news when he was a college freshman in 1964, and he’s still at it. %$* 526
as a host, robert has reported from europe, the middle east and all over the united states. %$* 526
he served for four years as director of npr’s news and information department. %$* 526
i’m now very pleased to turn the evening over to robert for the debate, “we must tolerate a nuclear iran.” thank you. %$* 526
thank you, john gordon, for your introduction, and i’d like to welcome all of you to the inaugural intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 33
i’d like to begin with some housekeeping. %$* 33
first the obligatory announcement at all public gatherings— could you please turn off your cell phones, pagers, pda’s, things that beep, talking toys or whatever else you might have with you tonight, that might interrupt the debate. %$* 33
also, if you have something that you might be tempted to unwrap in the course of the evening, this is being recorded for broadcast in radio, and the sound of wrapping paper crinkling is often a substitute for crackling fire, or it was in the old days. %$* 33
so please do the unwrapping now, before we begin. %$* 33
i’d like to explain the proceedings, what’s going to happen this evening. %$* 33
first, the proposer of the motion will start by proposing that side of the argument, and the opposition will follow. %$* 33
we will alternate from the pro to the con side, each presentation being eight minutes. %$* 33
i’ll be the time cop, and i’ll give them two-minute and one-minute warnings, and if they keep on talking, i’ll tell you to turn your cell phones back on and interrupt them. %$* 33
after all six speakers have spoken and finished, we’ll then have a question-and-answer session in which we will welcome your questions, and also your brief statements, and they will respond to you. %$* 33
when that question-and-answer session is complete, each debater will make a final statement lasting no more than two minutes. %$* 33
now, during the closing statements we then come to this perforated ballot-ticket that you were given on the way in. %$* 33
you were asked as you entered whether you were for or against the motion or undecided, and once again we will ask you, after you’ve heard from all of our speakers, to vote again, and you will do that in a manner i’ll describe. %$* 33
if you don’t have one of these now, we’ll take care of that when the time comes and the usher will provide you with a ballot. %$* 33
then after we’ve heard all the closing statements, we shall announce the results of both the poll that we took on the way in, and also the voting after you’ve heard these, what i hope will be very interesting and persuasive presentations. %$* 33
i’d like to introduce our panel right now. %$* 33
first, those who support and propose the notion that we must tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 33
george perkovich is a u.s.foreign policy expert and vice-president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace. %$* 33
welcome. %$* 33
karim sadjadpour, formally based in tehran, is a writer and iran analyst for the international crisis group. %$* 33
sanam vakil is assistant professor of middle east studies at johns hopkins university’s school of advanced international studies. %$* 33
that’s the side that proposes the motion we’re going to hear debated. %$* 33
to my left this evening, are patrick clawson, who is an author and also deputy director at the washington institute for near east policy, reuel marc gerecht, an expert in middle east affairs, formerly with the cia, currently a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute for public policy research, and best-selling author and co-founder/editor of the washington-based political magazine the weekly standard, william kristol. %$* 33
bill kristol rounds out our panel. %$* 33
so let us start the debate, proposing the motion, “we must tolerate a nuclear iran,” george perkovich, please take the podium. %$* 33
we have to be much more direct with president putin in russia. %$* 527
russia is the biggest impediment of getting the security council to take strong actions, and we can talk about that later. %$* 527
the general point is, prevention, all of us agree, is the best option. %$* 527
yet prevention is not the proposition we’ve been asked to debate here tonight. %$* 527
the question we are debating, is whether we can tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 527
that question assumes that diplomacy has failed, and we’re on to other options. %$* 527
then we have to ask, well, what are the alternatives to tolerating an iran that possesses nuclear weapons. %$* 527
well, one might say, well, we kill ourselves. %$* 527
if we can’t tolerate, we kill ourselves. %$* 527
that’s not a good option. %$* 527
the second option will be, well, we’ll kill all of them. %$* 527
make the problem go away. %$* 527
also not a good option, there are 74 million of them, three times the population of iraq. %$* 527
even if somehow it were morally justifiable, it wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem. %$* 527
the most feasible strategy that is the alternative, the most feasible strategy for not tolerating a nuclear iran, is an attack—a combination of attack on its known nuclear facilities, on its air force and navy to try to prevent its capacity to retaliate immediately, and on the revolutionary guard, to try to hasten regime change. %$* 527
this ought to be examined, and there are a long list of questions that arise from this. %$* 527
but the key thing in terms of the motion before us is, that you should not assume that this is a question of will power. %$* 527
in other words, if one says, “i will not tolerate a nuclear iran,” that somehow that solves the problem, that the will power to act—meaning to conduct a war—somehow achieves the objective of eliminating iran’s nuclear capability. %$* 527
there’s no reason actually to conclude that it would—that even if you had the will, you could eliminate that capability. %$* 527
but you have to factor that in, as well as the consequences of a potential action. %$* 527
now if i thought that a military attack of this type i described would actually eliminate that nuclear capability, and do it for a sufficient time, i would be for it, if the consequences of our attack were not going to leave us worse off. %$* 527
but to conclude that the consequences won’t leave us worse off, you have to ask a bunch of questions. %$* 527
to his great credit, reuel gerecht, our colleague, has written an essay last april in the weekly standard, that’s a very detailed treatment of a military option, which he ultimately advocates. %$* 527
reuel talks about a campaign, a military campaign, that he says would be “a series of actions and counter- actions between the u.s.and iran, that would probably transpire over many years, perhaps a decade or more.” now there’s a long list of questions that arise when you contemplate a war with iran lasting a decade or more. %$* 527
you’d have to know if we buy some time, maybe two or three years, in the first attack, what happens. %$* 527
well, the most likely thing that happens is the inspectors have to go, that’s been our major source of intelligence. %$* 527
so now when you want to figure out what else to attack over these years, your capacity actually to pinpoint things has diminished. %$* 527
the probability of hitting false targets, wrong targets, killing innocent people, being subjected to media treatments then of the mistaken bombing, goes up, and with each mistaken bomb, u.s.credibility in the world, in the region, in iran, is diminished. %$* 527
there are other questions. %$* 527
what are the odds then an air war will improve the prospects for democracy in iran? %$* 527
what are the odds that another war will make iran less threatening to the u.s. and israel? %$* 527
what are the odds that another war led by the united states will increase america’s capacity to solve the other problems in the world—iraq, afghanistan, the war on terror, international trade? %$* 527
you name the issues, will our credibility be enhanced if we conduct another war in the middle east? %$* 527
now reuel wrote his essay before the war in lebanon. %$* 527
i would argue that war has even further raised the bar, the difficulty, of thinking that a war against iran will actually solve this problem. %$* 527
we believe that another war would leave the united states and the world worse off than we would be by pursuing an alternative strategy. %$* 527
if you agree, you should vote in favor of the resolution. %$* 527
we argue there’s plenty of evidence to conclude that if more energetic efforts to prevent iran from getting nuclear— %$* 527
—fail, it will still be possible to deter and contain iran from using nuclear weapons against anyone. %$* 527
iran’s president is alarming, he is indeed alarming. %$* 527
but the leadership in iran is collective, and it includes many old men. %$* 527
these old men did not get old by being suicidal. %$* 527
iran, persia, has thousands of years of grand history, and there’s no reason whatsoever to think that iranian nationalists would sacrifice their nation and their civilization in a nuclear war of their making. %$* 527
there is other evidence of iran’s deterability. %$* 527
iran has not attacked the weaker united arab emirates with which it has a dispute over two resource-rich islands. %$* 527
iran did not attack the sunni extremist taliban government in afghanistan, even when that government killed, murdered, nine iranian diplomats. %$* 527
one minute. %$* 527
iran has a jewish population that is free to leave but chooses not to. %$* 527
there is no evidence that iran is not deterable. %$* 527
indeed, as reuel has written, “the islamic republic ceased to produce holy warriors by the end of the iran-iraq war in 1988.the potential for chiliastic rapture has just dried up.” the bigger point is this. %$* 527
voting for the motion does not mean doing nothing, or turning the other cheek to iran. %$* 527
voting for the motion means deciding that another war will not solve this problem, and that a robust, extremely tough strategy of deterrence and containment would be the most effective way to keep a nuclear iran from threatening the united states and its friends. %$* 527
thank you. %$* 527
two minutes— %$* 33
—fail, it will still be possible to deter and contain iran from using nuclear weapons against anyone. %$* 527
iran’s president is alarming, he is indeed alarming. %$* 527
but the leadership in iran is collective, and it includes many old men. %$* 527

thank you. %$* 527
thank you, george perkovich, for proposing the motion before us, “we must tolerate a nuclear iran.” and now to the podium we call the first opponent of that motion, patrick clawson. %$* 33
i thought george gave a very eloquent statement of why we should not go to war with iran, and if that were the proposition that we were debating, i think his arguments were spot-on. %$* 528
that however is not the proposition we’re debating. %$* 528
the proposition we’re debating is that we should not tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 528
that’s quite a different matter. %$* 528
in fact, there are many things that we could do, even if iran got a nuclear weapon, that would suggest to me that we would have non-military ways in order to persuade iran to give up that weapon. %$* 528
most of the countries of the world which developed—which had nuclear weapons have given them up, and not through war. %$* 528
so there are in fact many things that we can do, that would show we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran, short of war. %$* 528
so i would rather spend my time discussing the proposition as stated to you, namely that we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran, rather than discussing whether or not to go to war with iran. %$* 528
i would like to suggest that when it comes to a nuclear iran, the proposition is very well-stated, because it leaves vague exactly what do we mean. %$* 528
are we talking about the nuclear family in iran? %$* 528
or what are we talking about here? %$* 528
i for one have no objections if iranians care to choose to live in nuclear families. %$* 528
but what we are likely to have is a very gray case. %$* 528
we in fact do not have a smoking gun to show that iran has a nuclear weapons program. %$* 528
it’s unlikely that we’re going to wake up some morning to find that iran has exploded a nuclear weapon. %$* 528
what we have to deal with instead, is what iran openly declares that it is doing—namely building this complicated thing called a nuclear fuel cycle, to make the materials for having a nuclear weapon. %$* 528
the iranians themselves have described well why they’re doing this. %$* 528
in a remarkable speech, their chief negotiator for their nuclear weapons program wrote that having a fuel-cycle capability almost means the country that possesses this capability is able to produce nuclear weapons, should that country have the political will to do so. %$* 528
now that’s the judgment of the iranian government. %$* 528
the nobel peace prize-winning head of the international atomic energy agency, mohammed al baradei—who you may recall was no friend of george bush on the iraq matter—says that if iran does what iran announces it’s intending to do, that iran will be, quote, “a few months,” end quote, away from having a nuclear weapon. %$* 528
so our real question is, do we want to see iran have that kind of a capability, on the edge of having a nuclear weapon but not quite there. %$* 528
we’re not going to have the dramatic moment where iran explodes a nuclear weapon necessarily. %$* 528
if we need to act, we need to act much before then. %$* 528
we need to act when iran is getting this capability to make the essential elements for a nuclear weapon. %$* 528
that is what we have to concentrate on stopping. %$* 528
indeed, why do i think that that is something that not only we cannot tolerate, but we need not tolerate. %$* 528
let me count some of the reasons. %$* 528
first is that what the iranians are doing, is exploiting a loophole in the system that we have constructed to make sure that the world does not have a hundred countries with nuclear weapons. %$* 528
the iranians have correctly identified a real weakness in our system of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. %$* 528
indeed, muhammad al baradei has proposed a five- year moratorium on the construction of all fuel-cycle facilities worldwide, and has said that any such facility should be under international control, because the technology is so dangerous. %$* 528
if iran gets away with building this, it will not be the only country. %$* 528
we will not only have to tolerate a nuclear iran, we will have to tolerate a nuclear turkey, a nuclear egypt, a nuclear saudi arabia. %$* 528
a nuclear algeria. %$* 528
a nuclear venezuela. %$* 528
a nuclear south africa. %$* 528
a nuclear brazil. %$* 528
when we start having 20 or 30 countries with nuclear weapons, and we start having a multiple system of deterrence, it’s going to be very interesting if we have to go through the cuban missile crisis another 20 or 30 or 40 times. %$* 528
i’m not confident it’ll turn out so positively every time. %$* 528
i don’t think that deterrence is something that we can count on working every time, the way it did work with the soviets, once the soviets got so tired and brezhnev took over, and couldn’t care less about revolution. %$* 528
but in any case, i say we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran, because if we tolerate a nuclear iran, we will be tolerating many, many more nuclear countries, and that is not something that will lead to peace in the world. %$* 528
furthermore, we need not tolerate a nuclear iran, because there is much that we can do to stop it without having to talk about going to war. %$* 528
the fact is that iran has acknowledged to the international atomic energy agency that it’s been carrying out these clandestine nuclear activities for 18 years. %$* 528
but they haven’t gotten very far. %$* 528
now, a lot of that has broadcast our success, in fact having a system which does limit what iran can do. %$* 528
we have had a lot of successes in our efforts in stopping iran’s program. %$* 528
you may recall that we were very worried when the soviet union fell apart that its scientists and nuclear matter would show up around the world, causing proliferation. %$* 528
we started a big program called the nunn-lugar program to prevent that. %$* 528
and in fact, none of it has shown up in iraq. %$* 528
none of it. %$* 528
indeed, the iranians have had to, on the whole, do things themselves. %$* 528
the only thing that they were able to buy was a set of blueprints from a.q.khan of pakistan. %$* 528
i don’t know about you, but i can’t assemble furniture from ikea when i buy it with the blueprints. %$* 528
i certainly can’t program my vcr with the instructions that come with it. %$* 528
so buying a set of blueprints didn’t really get the iranians necessarily that far ahead. %$* 528
indeed, that’s why their program has taken 18 years, and is going very slowly. %$* 528
president ahmadinejad of iran claimed this last spring that they were going to have— %$* 528
—3,000 centrifuges up and operational by the end of the year. %$* 528
i don’t think he’s going to have 300.and we can, by reinforcing our system of controls on iran’s access to advanced technology, by mobilizing the world community, slow down iran’s program dramatically. %$* 528
to the point where iran might be able to make one bomb, but i don’t think it’ll be able to make a lot of bombs, and it certainly won’t have a way to deliver that thing. %$* 528
and if this bomb ends up being some two-ton monstrosity that they can barely fit into a bread truck, then they won’t have easy ways of delivering this thing. %$* 528
so, there are always ways in which the control on technologies makes the real difference. %$* 528
that’s why we should continue our efforts to limit iran’s access to these advanced technologies, rather than tolerating a nuclear iran and saying, well, now you’re in the nuclear club. %$* 528
okay, join the club, you can do what you want. %$* 528
no. %$* 528
we should, even if iran’s program progresses dramatically, continue to press them, continue to work on them— %$* 528
—and not tolerate it. %$* 528
furthermore, as george laid out at the end of his presentation, there are excellent reasons to think that, in fact, the iranian government is pretty cautious, in spite of this ahmadinejad of the moment. %$* 528
on the whole, right now the iranians think that they’re on top of the world and the strategic situation’s very good for them. %$* 528
but that too will change, and our job is to press them, press them so that the cautious element— which i entirely agree with george is very much there in the leadership—comes to the fore, and the iranians decide that this thing too risky, it’s not good for iran’s security, and we can get them to stop this program, or if the program’s advanced a long way, we can get them to reverse it. %$* 528
most of the countries that have had nuclear weapons have given them up. %$* 528
so we do not have to tolerate a nuclear iran, we can get them to stop, or if necessary to reverse. %$* 528
two minutes— %$* 33
—3,000 centrifuges up and operational by the end of the year. %$* 528
i don’t think he’s going to have 300.and we can, by reinforcing our system of controls on iran’s access to advanced technology, by mobilizing the world community, slow down iran’s program dramatically. %$* 528

okay, join the club, you can do what you want. %$* 528
no. %$* 528

one minute— %$* 33
—and not tolerate it. %$* 528

so we do not have to tolerate a nuclear iran, we can get them to stop, or if necessary to reverse. %$* 528
thank you, patrick clawson. %$* 33
we now turn to the proponents once again, and to sanam vakil. %$* 33
thank you. %$* 529
it’s a pleasure to be here tonight to tell you why we must tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 529
it’s time for the united states to rewrite the balance of power. %$* 529
iran has been using its nuclear program to bolster its legitimacy, domestically in iran, regionally in the middle east, and internationally, and this tactic is coming at the expense of american credibility and influence in these arenas. %$* 529
so by engaging iran over its nuclear program, washington can take this tool of coercion out of tehran’s hands, and once again have a larger degree of influence as well as credibility within iran, within the region of the middle east, and internationally. %$* 529
let me tell you how tehran is using its nuclear program to its advantage. %$* 529
let me start with the domestic. %$* 529
by engaging, the u.s. would prevent the iranian regime from using the nuclear program as a pretext for regime preservation. %$* 529
through its domestic policies, tehran has advanced its power under the guise of this program. %$* 529
the administration of mahmoud ahmadinejad is tactically manipulating its nationalistic nuclear ambitions to foster support domestically. %$* 529
important though, is if you ask the average iranian, what is nuclear energy, or what is uranium enrichment, they wouldn’t be able to tell you. %$* 529
this is what the government has homed in on. %$* 529
they’ve been able to exploit the double standards that exist within the international community, vis-à-vis iran’s nuclear program, compared to india’s, pakistan’s, north korea’s, and even israel’s. %$* 529
this is what the government draws strength. %$* 529
an edict was issued roughly six months ago through the national security council preventing negative media from being reported on nuclear issues domestically, and the government uses censorship of media to control popular access to any nuclear-related information, among other information as well. %$* 529
this way, the government has been successful in perpetuating nuclear nationalism, and controlling the effect of that nationalism. %$* 529
for iran, the nuclear issue is linked to the nation’s place in the modern world, national pride, and resistance against the west. %$* 529
an effort to prevent iran’s program from advancing is further associated to discrimination, and perpetuated by fears of sanctions and regime change. %$* 529
more interestingly, as i observed this summer during my visit to tehran, ahmadinejad has more support throughout tehran today and in other cities on foreign policy issues than he did last year after he was surprisingly elected. %$* 529
this is due to his confrontational approach, compared to the policy of détente that was pursued under the hatami administration. %$* 529
you might ask why. %$* 529
that’s because many iranians feel quite happy and proud that he has taken on the nuclear portfolio and succeeded in garnering more concessions for iran, compared to what was going on during the tenure of president hatami. %$* 529
so these confrontational tactics are also domestic tactics pursued by the government, acts of deflection to perpetuate a constant state of fear domestically, with regards to sanctions and even a military strike, and these tactics are designed to strengthen the hand of the regime and the unclear program. %$* 529
this is why we should tolerate a nuclear iran. %$* 529
we should think about the iranians at home that have to suffer under the regime. %$* 529
the same time, the government is using the opportunity of the nuclear threat to launch a domestic crackdown on elites within the system. %$* 529
they’ve closed down reformist newspapers. %$* 529
they’re purging universities of secular academics. %$* 529
they’re detaining students. %$* 529
they’re purging bureaucrats from the system. %$* 529
all in an effort to silence opposition, and all under the paradigm and all under the guise of the nuclear program. %$* 529
the regime is ever more united in the face of opposition. %$* 529
let’s also consider a counter-factual. %$* 529
if we do not tolerate iran’s unclear program, we are playing into the hands of ahmadinejad. %$* 529
he dreams of becoming a war president. %$* 529
why was he elected? %$* 529
he was elected on an economic platform. %$* 529
he was elected to be a populistic president. %$* 529
but since he’s been in power for the past year, he has yet to meet the demands of the people, and he has been pursuing foreign policy issues, not economic ones. %$* 529
any nuclear strike, military strike, or sanctions would give him just cause for continuing to neglect his electoral mandate. %$* 529
so let me offer you even one more final reason why we should tolerate a nuclear iran on the domestic agenda. %$* 529
the government is further playing to these domestic nationalistic sentiments of the iranian street, and playing up against the iranian street that has historically been very pro-american. %$* 529
they’re using their imagery of the war, and they’re using fear of sanctions and regime change to change the sentiment in iran against the united states, and this is a huge loss for washington. %$* 529
let’s turn to the region. %$* 529
ahmadinejad has also exploited the nuclear issue to no end. %$* 529
this issue has gained a lot of support among the arab and muslim street. %$* 529
he’s spoken of the double standards that exist among u.s.policies in the middle east. %$* 529
he’s taken on the plight of the palestinians, challenging the order in the recent war this summer, and he’s earned praise in capitols from cairo to jakarta. %$* 529
there’s also a credible— %$* 529
—threat of proxy war. %$* 529
it’s a notable one, and the regime has cultivated relations with proxies to counterbalance the very large american presence in the region with two unfinished wars on iran’s borders. %$* 529
so tehran’s message is simple—it’s a regime not to be reckoned with the u.s.is in a weakened position in iraq, palestine, lebanon, afghanistan, and with this growing conflict within the religion of islam. %$* 529
tehran is exploiting this to its advantage, drawing on the arab street for support at the expense of the united states. %$* 529
internationally. %$* 529
the regime’s confrontational regional and domestic approach of the nuclear program has also divided and weakened the international community at washington’s expense. %$* 529
unable to unite the international community and drive a consensus on sanctions, only weakens washington’s position further. %$* 529
jacques shirac recently defected, and china and russia are unable to back washington— %$* 529
—on any sanctions in this nuclear jockeying that’s going back and forth. %$* 529
let’s compare ahmadinejad. %$* 529
he’s able to rally 118 nam nations to support iran’s ambitions, and the united states can’t rally the p-5 and the security council? %$* 529
that’s depressing. %$* 529
so, ahmadinejad says he supports dialogue, let’s take him up on this offer. %$* 529
i leave you with this. %$* 529
the u.s.is losing the iranian street, it’s moving into dangerous territory in the arab and muslim world, and it’s losing support in the security council. %$* 529
let’s take the lever away from tehran. %$* 529
let’s not allow them to exploit their nuclear program at our expense anymore. %$* 529
thank you. %$* 529
two minutes— %$* 33
—threat of proxy war. %$* 529
it’s a notable one, and the regime has cultivated relations with proxies to counterbalance the very large american presence in the region with two unfinished wars on iran’s borders. %$* 529

thank you. %$* 529
thank you, sanam vakil. %$* 33
our next speaker, opposing the motion, is reuel marc gerecht. %$* 33
bigotry against tall men. %$* 410
i just want to start off by thanking george for using my own words against me. %$* 410
i sort of had the sensation of arguing with my wife and i inevitably lose those encounters. %$* 410
i will suggest that perhaps he maybe used some of my words a little selectively. %$* 410
i mean, i think patrick handled the geo-strategic issues rather well, i’m not going to go back over those. %$* 410
i also am not going to go over a point- counterpoint on the individual repercussions of a bombing run. %$* 410
i did that, as george said, at great length in a weekly standard piece and there’s no reason for me to torture any of you here who read it the first time through. %$* 410
but i will focus on a couple of issues which i think tend to get overlooked, particularly in american and europe audiences. %$* 410
when i hear the other side talking, i hear them talking about iran as if it’s a status quo country. %$* 410
i almost never hear them talk about god. %$* 410
i almost never hear them talk about the religious inspiration that still fuels the regime at the very top. %$* 410
what people have been anticipating inside of the islamic republic for the longest period of time, is that it would go thermidor. %$* 410
they thought it with rafsanjani, who by the way should really be considered the father of the iranian nuclear weapon. %$* 410
they thought it with him, even though at the very same time he was unleashing the intelligence ministry, the revolutionary guard corps and assassination teams and bombing teams that went around the world in the 1980s and ‘90s. %$* 410
they thought it about rafsanjani when he was calling these ecumenical movements, bringing in sunni militants into tehran on a regular basis and having outreach programs. %$* 410
by the way, ayman al-zawahiri, al qaeda’s number two, has been probably tehran’s favorite poster boy for over 20 years. %$* 410
i will just add there’s something deeply suspicious about members of al qaeda moving through iran before 9-11 and moving through iran after 9-11. %$* 410
it’s also very unusual for individuals who are under house arrest in tehran to be placing cell phone calls to operational units of al qaeda in saudi arabia. %$* 410
that is not the usual routine that people have when they’re under house arrest. %$* 410
i think we have to understand that absolutely, when you deal with the vast majority of iranian people, certainly iranian men—these are the ones we’re primarily talking about—that that chiliastic drive that you saw in the 1980s, they were really the mothership of much of the jihadism mentality that we see today transferred over to the sunni world, it’s dead. %$* 410
it died. %$* 410
if nothing else it died with the end of khomeini who was sort of the charismatic inspiration. %$* 410
unfortunately for the hardcore and for the elite, it’s not dead. %$* 410
i would argue it is as alive today as it was before. %$* 410
that doesn’t mean, once again, that you will not find individuals in that league who cannot be, quote, quite pragmatic. %$* 410
i was quite struck by the commentary of the fellow on cbs, the very, very old fellow, who went to interview ahmadinejad and he said he seemed like a very rational man. %$* 410
that is i think a very western comment, because we have this sort of false juxtaposition that individuals of die-hard belief and faith cannot be rational. %$* 410
they absolutely are. %$* 410
i mean khomeini was a very, very rational man, he had a certain love of neoplatonism that people don’t talk about but he was a more or less rational man. %$* 410
the same is true of ahmadinejad but ahmadinejad is a die-hard believer. %$* 410
so by the way is khomeini, so by the way i would argue is rafsanjani. %$* 410
what we have to worry about, is in fact that the anti-americanism at that level has not diminished. %$* 410
you have to think, do you want to do what is necessary to try to stop them from getting nuclear weaponry, because you’re not primarily talking about an exchange of nuclear weapons being a firing-off between the united states and iran. %$* 410
the iranians realize that will probably end up very badly for them. %$* 410
what are you interested in is, will this give them an umbrella for protection of terrorism. %$* 410
i think if you look at the western track record dealing with the clerical regime, that you have to say we’ve done a very poor job of responding to them. %$* 410
in many ways we have been at war with the islamic republic since its inception, except we have not responded. %$* 410
they have bombed, they have attacked, they have killed american soldiers, we did not respond. %$* 410
i suggest to you that what you’re going to see life they get nuclear weapons is a new inspiration, i think it’s already out there, and i would expect that ahmadinejad is once again trying to do what khomeini and rafsanjani had tried in the 1980s and failed. %$* 410
that was to lead the radical islamic world on a new anti- american jihad. %$* 410
i think you’re going to see them try to do it again, and the acquisition of nuclear weapon is a key to that element. %$* 410
it is their safeguard, it is their protection. %$* 410
once they have that i would argue that in fact the odds of them being able to strike the united states through proxies or directly will go up astronomically. %$* 410
should you take that risk? %$* 410
i would say no, that you have to say, do you want to give individuals who run what i would call sort of a more sophisticated version of bin ladinism, do you want to let them have the nuke? %$* 410
i would say under no circumstances. %$* 410
is it worthwhile to take the repercussion from that in afghanistan, which i don’t think are that much, in iraq, and i might add, the way iraq is going it’s going to be so bad— %$* 410
—it’s going to be very difficult for the iranians to try to make a difference. %$* 410
if you are willing to absorb the repercussion of that, i would say yes, absolutely, the nightmare scenarios that you would have when you have this hardcore elite, which i would argue will become more and more radical. %$* 410
because in fact the vast majority of iranians have sheared away from the visions and the dreams and the promises of the islamic revolution. %$* 410
they are not going in the direction of their citizenry, would that they were. %$* 410
they’re going in the opposite direction. %$* 410
the people inside of that regime, particularly i would argue the most important people, the clergy, the dissident clergy that i would argue are still the hope for that regime in the future, have in fact lost ground if not been completely stuffed. %$* 410
i would agree with sanam that public diplomacy is a very good idea. %$* 410
the united states should try to wage as best a public diplomacy as possible. %$* 410
but public diplomacy is not going to— %$* 410
—the nuclear weapons issue. %$* 410
would that we actually could improve our position inside iran, and i would just add by the way, the united states has a far better position inside that country, and it has maintained a relatively, if not pretty seriously hostile position against the islamic republic now for over 25 years, while the europeans have constantly tried to use engagement, yet their position inside of iran i think is far, far less. %$* 410
hostility towards the clerical regime has not cost us inside that country, it has in fact gained us a following. %$* 410
so you have to decide, are you willing to take a really serious risk, and i would add just tactically, you have to say yes. %$* 410
because diplomacy you know isn’t going to work unless you threaten the possibility, you have to be serious about it, of using military strikes. %$* 410
the only reason the europeans—and they will tell you that if you talk to the germans and the french and the british— %$* 410
time’s up? %$* 410
two minutes— %$* 33
—it’s going to be very difficult for the iranians to try to make a difference. %$* 410
if you are willing to absorb the repercussion of that, i would say yes, absolutely, the nightmare scenarios that you would have when you have this hardcore elite, which i would argue will become more and more radical. %$* 410

the only reason the europeans—and they will tell you that if you talk to the germans and the french and the british— %$* 410
time is up, reuel. %$* 33
time’s up? %$* 410
we’ll hear from the europeans later i think. %$* 33
thank you very much, reuel marc gerecht. %$* 33
now our third and final speaker in support of the motion, and that is karim sadjadpour. %$* 33
okay. %$* 530
thank you so much for coming, it’s really a privilege to be here and it’s a privilege to be personally speaking for bill kristol. %$* 530
it’s a big privilege and a big challenge. %$* 530
when i was in high school my father used to watch the sunday morning talk shows. %$* 530
my favorite guest was always bill kristol because he was always so thoughtful and sensible and sensitive, i just assumed he was a liberal. %$* 530
i must admit i was a late bloomer intellectually. %$* 530
i would just like to first start off by reiterating the point that george made, that i think all six of us here are after the same thing at the end of the day—an iran which is democratic, which is free, which is prosperous, and which is not armed with a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
that would be the ideal option. %$* 530
so the question is not whether or not the islamic republic is a cruel regime. %$* 530
it is, i can tell you as someone who has been detained in tehran by the revolutionary guard, it is a cruel regime. %$* 530
the question is not, again, why or whether or not iran should have a nuclear weapon we should tolerate. %$* 530
i think personally it would be disastrous if they were to acquire a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
but the question on our panel is, should we tolerate it, and that begs the question, should we go to war with iran to prevent it. %$* 530
which cost would be higher, to actually accept iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, or going to war with them to prevent it. %$* 530
i would suggest that the latter option would be far more dangerous, bombing iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear. %$* 530
i’m a bit surprised tonight that the other side of the table is seeming to—i’m a bit too junior to contradict them too much—but they’re running away from the argument somewhat because both reuel and bill are on the record saying that they would bomb iran. %$* 530
so hopefully, we hear that from bill in the next round. %$* 530
i would just argue similar to what sanam said, that if mahmoud ahmadinejad was here tonight, he would be arguing on the other side of the table, meaning i think he very much wants to see a confrontation between the u.s. and iran. %$* 530
i will just suggest why in three different contexts, why the iranians, particularly the hard-liners in tehran, would like to see a confrontation between the u.s.and iran. %$* 530
the first context is the regional context. %$* 530
what was very interesting for me following the right-wing iranian media was these comments which secretary rice made after the war in lebanon in july. %$* 530
what she called it was “the birth pangs of a new middle east.” when i was following the iranian right-wing media, it was very interesting how much they agreed with secretary rice, they said indeed it is the birth pangs of a new middle east. %$* 530
indeed this is a proxy war between the u.s.and iran for hegemony in the middle east, for arab and muslim hearts and minds. %$* 530
in fact we’re very well- placed to fight this war, and what’s very disconcerting right now is that these same newspapers in tehran which are very fascist when it comes to domestic politics, are jeffersonian democrats when it comes to regional politics because they say, actually, democratic elections are very much in our interest. %$* 530
hamas came to power in palestine, hezbollah came to power in lebanon through democratic elections, the muslim brotherhood had a very strong showing in egypt. %$* 530
hardcore religious came to power in iraq via democratic elections. %$* 530
so in fact, we are winning this war for arab and muslim hearts and minds, and given the u.s.’s low standing in the region, it looks like history is now on our side. %$* 530
opinion polls which are conducted show that among the arab street, the three most popular leaders are hassan nasrallah of hezbollah, mahmoud ahmadinejad of iran, and khaled meshaal of hamas. %$* 530
so right now iran feels in a very good position, and i think that bombing the country they would feel even better-placed to fight this war for arab and muslim hearts and minds. %$* 530
we should take into account that if we bomb iran, oil prices are likely going to go up to $150 a barrel. %$* 530
currently the regime is making about $200 million a day on oil revenue, so we double that, they’re going to make $400 million a day on oil revenue. %$* 530
i would argue that that will put them in a far better position to support hamas and hezbollah financially than if we don’t bomb the country. %$* 530
i think that just, if we’re serious about fighting this war, which is becoming very much this self-fulfilling prophecy of the clash of civilizations, we’re going to have to figure out a way to resolve our differences in the middle east without using bombs. %$* 530
the second point is from a non-proliferation perspective, from a nuclear perspective. %$* 530
what would happen if we actually bomb iran to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. %$* 530
let’s play out the scenario, in fact i played out the scenario with a navy captain. %$* 530
say we bomb these sites. %$* 530
first of all we don’t know where many of them are, some of them are underground, some of them we don’t have intelligence on, so we can’t be sure that we bombed the right sites. %$* 530
second of all some of them are near population centers, we would be killing iranian civilians. %$* 530
quite frankly, you know, if you talk to nuclear physicists they say, well, iran actually has quite a bit of know-how right now. %$* 530
it’s like baking a cake. %$* 530
they have the ingredients, they have the recipe, and they have the cooks, they have the scientists. %$* 530
unless you’re going to kill the scientists, you’re going to kill the cooks, i mean, it’s going to be very difficult to set back this program a long way. %$* 530
at most, in talking to nuclear physicists, it will take iran two to three years to recalibrate. %$* 530
at that point, if we bomb them, international public opinion may well side with them, and the iranians may say in fact we now are after a nuclear weapon because we now have been shown that we need it to protect our sovereignty. %$* 530
at that point, when you bomb these sites and you don’t know where iran is recalibrating these facilities, maybe underground, if we really then want to avert the prospect we’ll have to send in group troops. %$* 530
at this point, with our troops spread thin in iraq and afghanistan, that doesn’t look like a welcome prospect. %$* 530
now from the domestic perspective, this is the one that for me i feel most strongly about. %$* 530
when i first started this job, i didn’t get involved in this work because i was passionate about centrifuges and cascades and things like that, this is what george was saying— %$* 530
—but about the prospect of the future for the iranian people. %$* 530
there’s this widespread notion that all iranians are in favor of a nuclear program, which i would like to debunk. %$* 530
i think that, on one hand iran is a nationalist country, and many people feel strongly that we’re a great nation, why this double standard. %$* 530
india and pakistan can have this project, why can’t we. %$* 530
but at the same time this is a country that we forget experienced an eight-year war with iraq. %$* 530
not really one family was left unscathed by this war, there were half a million casualties. %$* 530
no one romanticizes the conflict or the prospect of further militarization. %$* 530
quite frankly this is a very technical project, the idea of enriching uranium as opposed to importing enriched uranium from abroad, so the idea that your average iranian in shiraz or tehran wakes up in the morning and says, you know, if only we could enrich uranium today our lives would be so much better half, has also been very much exaggerated. %$* 530
but i would argue that you present to the iranian people two options. %$* 530
you present this publicly to the regime. %$* 530
a, pursue this nuclear program unequivocally, come what may, for the sanctions, isolation, potential militarization. %$* 530
or b, you take certain nuclear compromises and you reenter the international community. %$* 530
you’re going to have the people put a lot of pressure on the regime to change their behavior, and so far this has not been a policy option which has been issued by the u.s. thank you very much. %$* 530
two minutes— %$* 33
—but about the prospect of the future for the iranian people. %$* 530
there’s this widespread notion that all iranians are in favor of a nuclear program, which i would like to debunk. %$* 530

you’re going to have the people put a lot of pressure on the regime to change their behavior, and so far this has not been a policy option which has been issued by the u.s. thank you very much. %$* 530
thank you. %$* 33
that’s karim sadjadpour, and now speaking against the motion, bill kristol. %$* 33
thank you, robert. %$* 127
let me begin by thanking bob rosenkranz for bringing intelligence squared to new york and to the united states. %$* 127
i don’t know if intelligence squared has a slogan or motto in london, but over here you might want to think about, “fair and balanced.” “we debate, you decide.” you might almost call this a no-spin zone here, you know. %$* 127
with robert siegel, it’s bill o’reilly %$* 127
i shouldn’t have said that, this will ruin his career on npr, and i’ll never be invited back to “all things considered.” i personally came in undecided, um, as many of you did, and even leaning slightly to the other side, but i’ve been convinced by reuel and patrick’s brilliant arguments. %$* 127
bob said he wanted intellectually respectable positions on both sides, and i have a high opinion of george and sanam and karim. %$* 127
but i’ve got to say that, unfortunately, they’re intelligent people but the arguments, while respectable, are not convincing. %$* 127
i was put off by karim’s false praise of me for a second, and i salute sanam for her genuine concern obviously for the iranian people who i think we all agree deserve a much better regime than they have, and i think we all agree, we haven’t talked about this, deserve much more aggressive efforts on the part of the united states and other democracies and europe could do much more here, to help them liberate themselves from this regime. %$* 127
george is one of the more reasonable democrats in washington. %$* 127
i’ve known him for a while and he worked for senator biden and i know that to be a fact, but the tip-off for all of you was when he said that he didn’t believe we should kill ourselves. %$* 127
i thought that was the safe position. %$* 527

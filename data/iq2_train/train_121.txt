we are starting and i would like to welcome our debaters onto the stage. %$* 13
thank you for that warm welcome to our debaters and i’d like to also ask for a warm welcome for the chairman and founder of intelligence squared us, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you all very much for joining us tonight, you know, the mission of intelligence squared, is to encourage our audience to consider both sides of contentious issues. %$* 1
to think twice about their positions. %$* 1
so one of our panelists tonight, former governor eliot spitzer, has certainly done that. %$* 1
just last week he thought twice about arguing in favor of tonight’s motion, and “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” decided to argue against it. %$* 1
when obama took office, the financial sector had just been saved from collapse by massive government intervention. %$* 1
that collapse occurred against the backdrop of a relatively benign real economy, with decent growth and high employment. %$* 1
then in the fourth quarter of ’08 and the first quarter of ’09, the real economy went into free fall. %$* 1
economic output shrank, and unemployment rose at rates that we haven’t seen since the great depression. %$* 1
the collapse of the real economy could’ve been a death blow for an already weak financial sector. %$* 1
we were truly on the edge of an economic abyss, and fear itself was becoming a real self-fulfilling prophecy. %$* 1
well the obama administration threw every policy weapon it could at the problem. %$* 1
zero interest rates, increased money supply, backstops for key financial institutions in the entire automotive industry, and a massive fiscal stimulus package. %$* 1
and confidence has clearly been restored. %$* 1
businesses are building inventories, consumers are spending, investors are no longer hoarding cash. %$* 1
the stock market is up 19 percent since the beginning of the year, and corporate bonds are up nearly as much. %$* 1
last quarter, we had 3.5 percent growth in the economy. %$* 1
it seems that the recession is over, and that armageddon has been avoided. %$* 1
is this not a picture of unalloyed success? %$* 1
well, not so fast. %$* 1
unemployment has increased to 10.5 percent. %$* 1
we bailed out the banks so that they could provide “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” credit to businesses and consumers, and instead they’re shrinking the loan portfolios. %$* 1
government deficits are running in the trillions. %$* 1
public debt has exploded, and the dollar is collapsing. %$* 1
we may eventually face a stark choice, between default, and inflation. %$* 1
and the private sector, the engine that has powered america’s economic dynamism, is facing the burden of higher tax rates, higher health care costs, carbon taxes, pro- union initiatives, pay czars and other intrusive regulation. %$* 1
with such powerful anti-growth forces in play, can we expect new jobs to put unemployed americans back to work? %$* 1
well, i’m not going to be the one to answer that question, but i will make a prediction. %$* 1
that tonight’s debate will be lively and informative, and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to john donvan, and the outstanding panelists we have with us this evening. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
andmay i just invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, welcome, everybody, to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan of abc news and once again it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator, as the six debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university, three against three, will be debating this motion, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” now, i want to point out this is a debate, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” it’s a contest and although we have some professors on the panels they are not here to lecture, they are here to attack and defend but with ideas well-articulated and well-argued, and in this debate, you our live audience here at the skirball center, act as the judges. %$* 13
by the time the evening has ended, you will have voted twice, once before the debate begins and once again at the end, to tell us whether you agree or disagree with the motion. %$* 13
and at the end of the debate the team that has changed the most minds, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, it is time to vote our preliminary vote, and if you go to the keypad on your left side %$* 13
there’s a range of buttons from 1 to 10.ignore all of them but 1, 2 and 3.if you push number 1 it means that you agree with the motion that “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” number 2 means that you disagree, and number 3 means that you’re undecided. %$* 13
and if you feel that you’ve pushed the buttons incorrectly, just repeat the correct entry and it will update to the current one. %$* 13
so it looks like everybody’s done that. %$* 13
and so our preliminary vote is in and let’s let the debate begin, round 1, opening statements by each debater, seven minutes each. %$* 13
we begin with mark zandi who is an economist and the founder of moody’s economy.com. %$* 13
during the 2008 presidential campaign he was an advisor to senator john mccain, he has since become an advisor to the obama white house, mark, i’m not sure what that tells us about which side you’re on %$* 13
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” but the floor is yours— %$* 13
i’m an ecumenical economist, let’s put it that way. %$* 17
i want to thank intelligence squared for the opportunity to be here today, it’s certainly an honor to be here and to address such an important topic. %$* 17
i’m going to make three points in my opening remarks. %$* 17
point number one. %$* 17
i think it’s really quite amazing the totality of the policy response from the administration, i think, we forget all the things that have been done to try to shore up the economy and we tend to focus on the one or two or three things that we’re most annoyed about, and we focus on that. %$* 17
let me just spend a few minutes, well, i’ve got six minutes and 30 seconds, let me spend a couple minutes going over that. %$* 17
and there are three broad areas of policy effort here, first is the effort to shore up to the financial system, and this is everything from what the fdic has done, increasing deposit insurance limits, to guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue to efforts by the treasury to help facilitate all the things that the federal reserve board has been doing to try to provide credit to the financial system and stabilize the financial system. %$* 17
perhaps the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to shore up the financial system, was the banks’ stress tests-- %$* 17
do you remember the stress test, this was done back earlier this year. %$* 17
and to me, those stress tests were the modern-day “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” equivalent of what fdr did back in the great depression, he— i’m going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit. %$* 17
he closed all the banks on a friday and he said on the subsequent monday to his treasury secretary, open all of them except a couple hundred of them and the treasury secretary said to him, well, which ones should i open, and fdr said, well, it really doesn’t matter because the ones you open, everything will think are safe, and life will go on and— in fact it worked, it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the end of the great depression and the stress test in fact did that, it restored confidence and the financial system is stable. %$* 17
the second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two weakest parts of our economy, the housing market and the auto market. %$* 17
i’m not going to spend much time on the auto market because steve is so intimately involved in that great effort, and he’ll talk about that, but i know housing, and the efforts to shore up the housing market have been quite amazing, and just to name a few things. %$* 17
the first-time homebuyer tax credit, very important in stabilizing housing values this summer, to help to support buying by first-time home buyers, the loan modification plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure, to get their monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their, their mortgage payment. %$* 17
efforts to provide more credit to the residential mortgage market through fannie mae and freddie “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” mac and fha.here’s a statistic for you. %$* 17
90 percent of all the residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by the federal government, so if the federal government wasn’t making those loans, the housing market would be in complete disarray and we’d be in very significant trouble, so the second broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors, the two weakest sectors of our economy. %$* 17
and the third policy response, broadly speaking, is the fiscal stimulus, much maligned, but ultimately at the end of the day, very successful. %$* 17
i don’t think it’s any accident that the recession came to an end, at the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum economic benefit to the economy. %$* 17
and the stimulus is lots of things, it’s aid to unemployed workers, it’s helped the state governments, it’s the first-time homebuyer tax credit, it’s cash for clunkers, a long list of things, the infrastructure spending, all very important. %$* 17
so, please remember, point number one, that the policy effort is a range of many things, it’s been incredibly— it’s amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done here, and key to bringing an end to this great recession. %$* 17
point number two, here are the statistics i think are overwhelming. %$* 17
a year ago, think about a year ago, what was going on, major financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized, fannie mae, freddie mac, lehman, bear, aig, citigroup was on the doorstep of falling apart, and look at the situation today. %$* 17
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” the financial system is not normal, no, but it is stable. %$* 17
and banks aren’t lending to us yet as business people and as consumers but they’re moving in that direction, and just imagine where we’d be today without that stability in the financial system. %$* 17
think about the economic statistics, housing activity, new and existing single-family housing starts hit a low in january, housing construction hit a low in january, back at the beginning of the year, housing values were falling very rapidly, today, the last couple of quarters they’ve actually begun to increase. %$* 17
gdp, the value of all the things that we produce as an economy, grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broad- based, that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a half. %$* 17
and clearly driving the economy forward, the gdp in the fourth quarter, the current quarter, is on track to be positive again. %$* 17
the job market. %$* 17
last thing to improve, but it is improving, we’re moving in the right direction. %$* 17
we—just to give you a statistic, at the beginning of the year, we were losing 700,000 jobs on average every single month. %$* 17
in the last three months we lost 200,000 jobs a month, now i know, that’s a lot of jobs, unemployment is still rising. %$* 17
but the trend lines are right, they’re moving in the right direction and my view is by early next year, we will have a stable job market, and by the end of next year, we will have job growth that’s meaningful enough to bring down the rate of unemployment, so everything is moving in the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” right direction. %$* 17
finally, point number three, i said there were three points %$* 17
the proposition is, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” it’s not, they have worked. %$* 17
this is not a mission accomplished, no one is arguing that this is over and done with, we have more work to do, and the administration is still working. %$* 17
just last week, they passed another piece of legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for people who lose their jobs in 2009, now if you become unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, they extended, and they expanded the first- time homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to the housing market, and they’ve provided a number of other supports. %$* 17
they are debating right now and will likely pass other efforts to shore up the economy, extend some of the other provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010.and more importantly and perhaps most importantly, we are working through some of the structural problems in our economy, working on the hard, difficult issues, the most obvious would be financial regulatory reform. %$* 17
now this is something you don’t want to do quickly, you don’t want to make a mistake. %$* 17
our financial regulatory structure has been in place since the great depression. %$* 17
it feels like it, and we have got to take time to make it right. %$* 17
so, in my view, what the administration has done has “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” been highly successful. %$* 17
thank you, mark zandi. %$* 13
and i just want to point out the amazing virtuosity of mark zandi who was watching the clock the whole time, and he said “thank you” as the clock that’s in front of us you can’t see, turned to zero. %$* 13
it’s just about perfect. %$* 13
our motion is “obama’s economic policies are working effectively” and our first debater to argue against the motion, james galbraith of the university of texas, he generally argues from the left, he also has a rather scathing view of economists in the united states in general, he has said that, on all important policy issues, they are on the wrong side, himself an economist, james galbraith. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 370
the question before the house may appear political. %$* 370
but it in fact is not. %$* 370
one person on our panel as you’ve heard, shifted his position to argue our side. %$* 370
two of us, supported president obama in the last election and all three of us hope that he will succeed. %$* 370
the question is about the economy, it is about whether the economic program is working effectively. %$* 370
lawrence summers, the chief economic advisor to the president, told the washington post on november 8th, quote, “i “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” think we got the recovery act right. %$* 370
the primary objective of our policy is having more work done, more product produced, and more people earning more income.” we agree with that standard. %$* 370
the economy is not performing up to that standard. %$* 370
basically, if you leave aside the actions some of which mark mentioned such as the extension of deposit insurance by the fdic, that were taken under the bush administration, the obama economic program %$* 370
the principal points are two. %$* 370
one is the recovery act, the stimulus bill, and the other is the policy of providing free reserves, credit at zero interest rate, to the banking system in the hopes that credit will flow again. %$* 370
so the question before us is, was the stimulus sufficient, and secondly, is credit flowing again. %$* 370
now the stimulus did some good things, it helped forestall the complete collapse of budgets in the state and local government sector, it created some construction jobs and will create more. %$* 370
it has provided some tax relief. %$* 370
the question is, is it enough. %$* 370
i think it is pretty clear, that it was not enough. %$* 370
the stimulus was enacted based on a forecast that unemployment would not rise past about 8 percent by the middle of this year, would decline thereafter, that forecast was clearly wildly optimistic. %$* 370
it underestimated the state and local crisis where job cuts, or, just offsetting, the jobs created with federal funds. %$* 370
it did too little too late to meet the foreclosure crisis which is presently running at several million homes a year. %$* 370
let me quote a distinguished “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” economist. %$* 370
on november 6th, 2009, he wrote, “after rising for more than two and a half years the country’s unemployment rate crossed into double-digit territory in october, with a jobless rate of 10.2 percent. %$* 370
this provides another sign of the severity of the current downturn, the very long road we face back to full employment, and the urgent need for more policy action to create jobs and protect those who can’t find work. %$* 370
with such a huge fire, we need every hose we can find to put it out.” i agree with that. %$* 370
there is an urgent need for more policy action. %$* 370
who said it? %$* 370
why, larry mishel, president of the economic policy institute said it just 10 days ago. %$* 370
what you said %$* 370
if you say this, that you also agree with larry summers, that the recovery act got it right. %$* 370
now i am not an economic forecaster. %$* 370
but there are forecasters i greatly respect, and here is what one of them testified to congress, on october 29th. %$* 370
“it is growing clear,” he said, “that more policy help will be needed to ensure that the tentative recovery evolves into a self-sustaining expansion. %$* 370
although a double-dip downturn is less than likely, meaningful threats to the recovery still exist. %$* 370
most notable, are the intensifying stresses in the job market, the ongoing foreclosure crisis, the boom and bust in the commercial real estate market the dysfunctional structured finance market and the fiscal woes of state and local governments.” quite an impressive list and i hesitate to say this in a theater but it “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” sounds like other than that, mrs. %$* 370
lincoln, how did you enjoy the play. %$* 370
to go on, “congress must provide more resources to unemployed workers, whose benefits are running out, to state and local governments unable to balance their budgets and to household and businesses looking to buy homes and invest.” i agree with that. %$* 370
congress must provide more resources. %$* 370
who said it. %$* 370
why, mark zandi said it, founder of moody’s economy.com, just two weeks ago. %$* 370
would you say this, if you agreed with larry summers, that the recovery act got it right. %$* 370
now it’s true, free money has saved the banks, everyone knows this, from their profit reports and their bonuses. %$* 370
the stock market has come back and so has the price of oil. %$* 370
is this enough? %$* 370
we think not. %$* 370
we think the housing crisis is important, we think the collapse of small business is important, we think 10 percent unemployment as far as the eye can see is a disaster. %$* 370
we know as every business in america knows that credit is not flowing again. %$* 370
what would a working program look like. %$* 370
first it would dissolve rather than coddle the toxic banks. %$* 370
it would stop the displacement of people from their homes, not just slow it, not just help a few, but stop the displacement of people from their homes. %$* 370
it would help all their workers who are ready to leave their jobs, to retire by providing them with a more comfortable employment, and health care that they can count on at an earlier age than 65, opening up places for younger people who are “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” looking for jobs in today’s catastrophic labor market. %$* 370
and it would fund a lot of new green jobs, all across the country, providing every american who wants a chance to work, for the duration, until the private sector comes back, revives and is able to take up the slack. %$* 370
on our side, we don’t agree, on all of the issues. %$* 370
but on the issues just outlined and i submit they are the essential issues, the facts are plain. %$* 370
better than nothing is not good enough. %$* 370
there was a poll %$* 370
released just a few days ago on november 6th, which stated that 47 percent of americans think that the economy is still the most important issue, that’s against all the other issues that might be considered. %$* 370
the american people know what this is about. %$* 370
they do not think that the program is working effectively, and that is surely telling. %$* 370
if it were working effectively, they would know. %$* 370
thank you very much. %$* 370
well %$* 13
.we just had another one of those one-second accomplishments. %$* 13
next to argue for the motion, we asked the white house if they would provide a member of the administration to take part in the debate, they did not want to do that, but they suggested our next debater, larry mishel who is the president of the economic policy institute, so larry—i’m not saying you’re the white house’s guy. %$* 13
but, now everybody’s going “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” to think of you that way as as you get up, but the floor is yours. %$* 13
well, i hope i get invited to the next official state dinner then— you know, as an economist, over my career i’ve been focused on what are the living standards of the american people, the working class. %$* 371
how they’ve done, and so what has mattered to me most on economic policy, is in fact, what have we done to create jobs, to get the unemployment rate down. %$* 371
and so i’m going to focus on the recovery act. %$* 371
and i’m here to say that i think it has actually been a bold and effective act. %$* 371
no, it has not solved all our economic problems. %$* 371
it has not solved the unemployment problem. %$* 371
that is not quite the standard that you should imagine, for judging whether the policies are effective. %$* 371
let me just say—my imagery for all this. %$* 371
president obama inherited a really large apartment building, it was all aflame, afire. %$* 371
he gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could, and he put out the flames, in at least half the floors. %$* 371
but the critics say, look, there’s still fire and so your policies must be wrong. %$* 371
and especially, it turns out, these critics are the conservatives who actually lit the darn fire. %$* 371
and they tried to keep the fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building. %$* 371
i think it’s actually quite outrageous. %$* 371
now it’s a somewhat different— i think it’s somewhat different to my “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” longtime, i don’t have any old friends, only have longtime friends, jamie galbraith. %$* 371
but we’ll get around to that. %$* 371
so let me talk at first about what the fire was. %$* 371
mark talked about it. %$* 371
over the nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009, none of which were the responsibility of president obama, okay, we had the fastest decline in the economy, basically since they started collecting the data in 1947 on a quarterly basis. %$* 371
we had already seen six million jobs lost by march 2009.the unemployment rate was already 8.5 percent, which is the highest it was since the great, really deep recession of the early 1980s. %$* 371
so we were in deep %$* 371
you know what. %$* 371
and so we had the recovery act which was passed very quickly and effectively, actually started having some effect in march, but mostly started having an effect in april. %$* 371
and i want to go through exactly what it does, so it’s not an abstraction. %$* 371
what are the different components. %$* 371
first as mark mentioned, support to the unemployed, and helping them not only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits, extended benefits, and health care, and a major increase in food stamps. %$* 371
why does that matter. %$* 371
by supporting their incomes and their spending it creates jobs, throughout the economy. %$* 371
secondly. %$* 371
there was a major influx of money to state governments, who, by resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and raise taxes, they actually-- %$* 371
what paul krugman said is they are “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” like 50 little herbert hoovers. %$* 371
they are driving us into recession, by actually exacerbating the problem. %$* 371
okay. %$* 371
when you give them the money, they don’t cut the programs, they keep the people that work for them in the local government’s employ. %$* 371
to keep the contractors and the private sector delivering construction contracts, health care, nursing homes, et cetera, employed, and by all those people being employed through spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy. %$* 371
okay, there’s also a third, a tax cut that was in effect in april, everybody’s withholding on their w-2’s, was actually increased, providing more income, more money to spend. %$* 371
last there was some government spending in infrastructure that started going out. %$* 371
but the main infrastructure spending, actually is scheduled for 2010.that’s when we get the energy alternatives, that’s when we get more infrastructure, and other things that are going to create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs. %$* 371
what has been the effect of all this spending? %$* 371
well as mark said, over the last six months, we’ve actually seen a much different outcome than what was projected in the springtime, the economy shrank by a little bit, it would’ve shrunk by around 4 percent, but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent. %$* 371
in the summer the economy actually grew. %$* 371
now, as someone dedicated to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class, who’s satisfied with that, i’m not satisfied with that, okay? %$* 371
but “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” the question is, are you going to judge the obama administration policy ineffective, because it hasn’t corrected what i think is 30 years of generating inequality, false-hearted, silly deregulation and worshipping of markets where we shouldn’t have done it that got us into this darn mess? %$* 371
i don’t think that’s quite appropriate. %$* 371
thank you—don’t take my time. %$* 371
um— we calculate that the recovery act has actually created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of september. %$* 371
i’m not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 rather than 700,000, but i think it’s quite great. %$* 371
i’m very worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for many years to come, too high. %$* 371
i don’t blame that on president obama, i blame that on the bums that put us in this mess. %$* 371
and you should too. %$* 371
now, it’s true that the unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it was going to be. %$* 371
they said if we did the recovery act it was going to only get to 8 percent. %$* 371
well, let me mention something. %$* 371
the unemployment rate in march, before the recovery act even had an effect was already 8.5 percent. %$* 371
now i did tell my friends in the white house, that’s a silly thing, don’t project like that. %$* 371
you shouldn’t do that, you’re going to get caught by that, and in fact, they have been hung by their own petard so to speak. %$* 371
but the fact is that, let me tell you that this is not a policy failure. %$* 371
this is a failure of my profession, economists. %$* 371
if you look at what “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” economists projected right at the time of the election, the blue- chip forecasts, and look at that same period i told you about, the nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first three months of this year. %$* 371
now they’re already halfway through that period. %$* 371
and they were saying that the economy was going to shrink at a 1.5 percent rate, over that nine-month period. %$* 371
and it actually shrank by three times that much. %$* 371
so the fact is, what the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didn’t have a right sense of what things were going to be without the policy. %$* 371
i think they got the policy right, the policy’s had a substantial impact. %$* 371
now has it solved all our problems, the fact is i’m not so sure how much more could’ve been done, economically. %$* 371
i can darn well tell you that politically, there was not much more on the table that they could get. %$* 371
what was put through the house and was put through the senate, what was stopped, is some people that were in the senate, who are known as moderates which just means they want to do a little bit less of what everybody else— %$* 371
and thank you very much. %$* 371
larry mishel—your time is up. %$* 13
and thank you very much. %$* 371
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” so here is where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams out there, fighting it out over this motion, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” and now on to our fourth debater. %$* 13
allan meltzer who is an economist at carnegie mellon university, he is not the liberal member of his team, he is far from it. %$* 13
and if you caught cnbc a few days ago allan meltzer appeared there and i quote, “we have an administration that spends and spends and lies.” ladies and gentlemen, allan meltzer. %$* 13
i’m here to talk about the obama policy, not about apartment house fires. %$* 372
the policy has had a mixed result. %$* 372
there’re some small positive effects. %$* 372
but, there are five reasons for concluding the policies are not working effectively. %$* 372
first, the forecast was that $780 billion would be spent, the maximum unemployment rate would be 8 percent. %$* 372
second, it’s now 10.2 percent, continuing to rise, that’s a failure. %$* 372
the second, is the administration recognition that the policy has failed. %$* 372
if the policy had succeeded, they would not be talking about another stimulus program, it recognizes, that talk recognizes, that the stimulus was not effective. %$* 372
that their “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” policies have, so far, been very weak. %$* 372
third, the administration invented something called “jobs saved.” you can search economic textbooks from now to the end of time, you will not find something called “jobs saved.” jobs saved, how do you know if you job is saved. %$* 372
sure, it was true that, if we paid the states to have a smaller deficit, they didn’t fire quite so many teachers. %$* 372
but, we also shifted the deficit, to the federal government, with higher future tax rates that are going to have to pay for those, over the long term. %$* 372
this administration has failed on the main thing that it needs to do, which is to tell us, how are we going to get out of this mess. %$* 372
the composition of the stimulus is the fourth problem. %$* 372
that was decided in the congress. %$* 372
it was a mistake by the obama administration to let it be decided in the congress, because the congress was interested much more in the redistribution of wealth than it was in seeing jobs and the economy improved. %$* 372
one-third of the stimulus went to state and local governments, for their deficits. %$* 372
that may be good or bad policy, but it has very little stimulus. %$* 372
it simply transfers the deficit from one place to another. %$* 372
also, a big piece of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut. %$* 372
we’ve had lots of evidence on temporary tax cuts. %$* 372
the bush administration, the ford administration, the carter administration, they all tried temporary tax cuts. %$* 372
the economic evidence is, temporary tax cuts don’t do much. %$* 372
the only major stimulating tax cuts that “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” we’ve had in the post-war period were the kennedy-johnson tax cuts, and the reagan tax cuts. %$* 372
they were permanent tax cuts, people knew that once they got them, they were theirs. %$* 372
finally fifth. %$* 372
this program is so off the block. %$* 372
do you remember shovel-ready projects? %$* 372
well, only 25 percent of the dollars for the infrastructure have been spent. %$* 372
maybe that part of the program will do some good when it gets started, but the economy is in a slow recovery. %$* 372
so that part of the program is hardly a success. %$* 372
now the economy has recovered, and the members of the affirmative tell us about how much better things are than they were a year ago. %$* 372
but is that a result of the obama policy, or is it the natural tendency of the economy when it sinks, when inventories get very low, to be rebuilt, because that’s where a lot of the third-quarter improvement came from, the rebuilding of inventories. %$* 372
very little of it in consumption. %$* 372
most of the recovery in the third quarter came from temporary clunkers, and housing. %$* 372
the housing policy is full of corruption. %$* 372
people come in and ask for the $8,000, they send their children, because they’ve already bought a house, they send their children to do it, the washington post had a long expose of the corruption in the housing problem. %$* 372
i believe that we have the wrong policy. %$* 372
the problem for the united states for the future, the problem that we are all going to face for a long time to come, is that we have a huge debt, that a lot of, part of it is owed to foreigners, and it’s “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” growing. %$* 372
so, you don’t have be to an academic economist to figure out that the way we’re going to pay for that is to export. %$* 372
and the way to export more, would be to invest more, and earn our way out of that problem. %$* 372
what the administration is doing is the wrong thing. %$* 372
it’s trying to build up consumption. %$* 372
fortunately, it isn’t being very successful. %$* 372
now the cbo, the congressional budget office, says we have a debate explosion. %$* 372
it’s unsustainable. %$* 372
it’s headed toward a debt crisis. %$* 372
the congressional budget office says that every 10-point increase, percentage point increase in the debt ratio, lowers gdp growth by a quarter percent. %$* 372
this administration is increasing the debt by 50 percentage points. %$* 372
that’s a policy failure. %$* 372
the government debt to gdp ratio was about 50 percent, when the administration took office. %$* 372
the cbo trajectory says, it’s going to 700 percent. %$* 372
700 percent is not a point we’re going to reach, because it’s unsustainable. %$* 372
that means, we’re headed, unless we do something about the exploding debt, we’re going to have a crisis. %$* 372
we absorb a considerable part of world savings, that too is unsustainable. %$* 372
why. %$* 372
well, the bush drug bill. %$* 372
the obama health care bill. %$* 372
a great many of the things that the congress does, increase the deficit. %$* 372
you can’t believe, that we’re going to cut medicare by $500 billion in order to get the drug bill passed. %$* 372
but that’s what you have to believe, if you believe that this administration is going to give you health care without paying. %$* 372
“obama’s economic polices are working effectively” we are on an unsustainable policy, and it’s a failed policy. %$* 372
many years ago i started to tell people, capitalism without failure, is like religion without sin. %$* 372
governor spitzer’s going to talk about that in the context— in the context %$* 372
in the context of the banking system— %$* 372
thank you. %$* 372
vote no! %$* 372
allan meltzer, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 372
vote no! %$* 372
our motion is, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” and our next debater, who will be arguing for the motion, steve rattner, who has gone through many careers. %$* 13
he began as a journalist. %$* 13
he switched to finance. %$* 13
good call, by the way. %$* 13
and he recently had the beginning of a political career as a treasury official. %$* 13
he came to the white house and was given the job of the auto rescue—the gm deal, that’s him. %$* 13
the chrysler deal, that’s him. %$* 13
however, he does not like the term car czar, which is too bad, because it’s very musical. %$* 13
well, my paternal grandparents, who were fur peddlers in moscow, would be rather shocked at the idea that i was a czar of “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” any kind, so i will. %$* 373
i don’t have anything to follow allan meltzer’s last remark, i’m afraid. %$* 373
but i was struck listening to the first two speakers from the other side. %$* 373
i feel a little bit like goldilocks. %$* 373
i heard one speaker that we in the obama administration were too hot and i heard one sort of imply we were too cold. %$* 373
and that makes me think we got it about right. %$* 373
all kidding aside, i actually do want to make a serious point. %$* 373
and with all due respect to the first two speakers from the other side, i want to try to take the ethereal world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics. %$* 373
because i heard a few things that kind of, that did strike me. %$* 373
i heard jamie say, congress must provide more resources. %$* 373
we must resolve the toxic banks. %$* 373
we can’t let it be decided by congress. %$* 373
well, who else decides things besides congress? %$* 373
we have to stop the displacement of people from their homes. %$* 373
i mean, these are all wonderful phrases but this is, as i found in my six months in washington, not how the world works. %$* 373
as rahm emanuel said the other day, it’s fine to imagine yourself sitting under a shady tree at the aspen institute thinking of great policies. %$* 373
but then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world and deal with it. %$* 373
so you can say, people can say our stimulus program was not enough, but the fact is, as larry said just at the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” end of his remarks, it was all congress was going to pass. %$* 373
there was no more there. %$* 373
it took every ounce of political muscle that the administration had to get that. %$* 373
you can say it was too much but i think as larry summers has said many times, when you are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more, not less. %$* 373
and they did as much as was possible. %$* 373
so i just want to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest surprises that i found coming to washington. %$* 373
we may all talk about the president and say, it’s the president’s decision. %$* 373
the president recommends this, the president does that. %$* 373
but there is a little thing called congress that has to be dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes and judgments. %$* 373
and so when jamie galbraith says, all obama did was two things: the stimulus program and the low interest rates—which actually wasn’t even obama. %$* 373
that was the federal reserve—it’s really not fair. %$* 373
i think the obama administration – and we’ll talk more about autos in a minute—but this financial regulatory reform which has been put forward, this energy which has been put forward, this health care which has been put forward, this housing which has been put forward—all these problems that were unattended to for the last eight years, this administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” responsible way. %$* 373
let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because i think my two fellow panelists made very, very coherent and logical and i hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful. %$* 373
and so let me talk for a second about autos. %$* 373
because it was an interesting area. %$* 373
it’s one of the few areas where the president actually did have authority. %$* 373
and so if you don’t like what the president did on autos, it’s fair to blame the administration for that because we didn’t have to go to congress. %$* 373
we had tarp money. %$* 373
we didn’t have to deal with the federal reserve and the fdic, except in one fairly minor way. %$* 373
we were pretty free to act. %$* 373
and when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side of the aisle saying, you’ve gotta let these companies fail. %$* 373
you’ve gotta let the market work. %$* 373
i’m sorry i don’t have any quotes from jamie, but i did see one quote from allan when i was poking around where, when lehman brothers went out of business allan said, no big deal. %$* 373
it’s fine. %$* 373
that’s the way-- %$* 373
you should have consequences from capitalism. %$* 373
that’s the way it should work. %$* 373
and then a year later he said lehman brothers should have been saved. %$* 373
and so we had a lot of people saying to us, oh, just let the market work. %$* 373
well, i hope the people who “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” said, let’s just let the market work, knew what that would have meant. %$* 373
it would have meant that chrysler and gm would have shut down by the end of march. %$* 373
it would have meant that hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business. %$* 373
they all would have liquidated. %$* 373
it would have meant that ford would have stopped making cars because they wouldn’t have been able to get parts because their suppliers, many of them, would have been shut down. %$* 373
and you would have had something like three million people out of work, mostly in the industrial midwest right at the end of march, right when the economy was at its worst. %$* 373
so it’s fine to say, let’s let the market work. %$* 373
but again, let’s try to connect it back to the real world and what the real world consequences would be of letting that happen. %$* 373
then you had some people, frankly, on the other side who basically said, you can’t let these companies go bankrupt. %$* 373
it would be catastrophic, it would be a disaster. %$* 373
nobody would buy cars. %$* 373
they would eventually liquidate. %$* 373
you can’t possibly do that. %$* 373
but president obama made the decision that we weren’t going to simply kick the can down the road, frankly, the way the previous administration had, and we were only going to inject money in the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to include bankruptcy, which it ultimately did. %$* 373
and we achieved unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholders—from the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” lenders, from the uaw, from the suppliers, from the dealers, from everybody who was affected—came to the table and, frankly, with a fair amount of muscle from the administration, participated in this restructuring. %$* 373
and the result of that was that today general motors announced their earnings. %$* 373
they’re still losing money but their performance was wildly better than anybody would have guessed. %$* 373
they have forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had. %$* 373
they’re out of bankruptcy. %$* 373
chrysler is out of bankruptcy in alliance with fiat. %$* 373
so i think it is a very vivid example of a place where we weren’t too hot, we weren’t too cold. %$* 373
we were very pragmatic. %$* 373
we addressed the problem, we focused on it and we tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned. %$* 373
and i think that that exercise, which i was proud to be a small part of, was emblematic of the approach that this administration has taken. %$* 373
tim geithner and larry summers, the two principal economic policy makers, have strong views of principle but they are experienced, they are pragmatic. %$* 373
they know how to get things done. %$* 373
they are balanced and they are very thoughtful. %$* 373
and i think that the approach that they have taken throughout this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” things that you heard larry and mark talk about in terms of bringing this country back from the abyss, bringing us back from a depression and getting us started down the road. %$* 373
of course, i think it was—i forget who on the other side said—47 percent of people think the economy is the most important issue. %$* 373
of course it’s the most important issue. %$* 373
but that doesn’t mean we haven’t made good progress. %$* 373
that doesn’t mean that disaster hasn’t been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have begun to sprout. %$* 373
so i was very proud to be a part of that and i would simply say to you, would you prefer this administration or the last administration or some other administration? %$* 373
because i think this administration has done awfully well. %$* 373
thank you, steve rattner. %$* 13
our motion is, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively.” and here as our final speaker, to argue against the motion: eliot spitzer, the former attorney general and governor of new york—a man whose career has been marked much in headlines, some that were favorable, some that were not. %$* 13
he is, however, at this point in the media himself, having become a financial columnist for slate. %$* 13
and i want to point out to our audience that when this debate was conceived, eliot was actually going to argue the other side. %$* 13
he was going to say the economic policies are working effectively. %$* 13
he has switched sides now. %$* 13
and eliot, i hope in your opening remarks “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” you address the basic question: what’s that all about? %$* 13
sure. %$* 374
well, that was not a proposition, but thank you. %$* 374
first, first even, before i do that, john, well, let me just thank allan meltzer. %$* 374
if i follow his logic i have found religion. %$* 374
the short answer to your question is that i read mark’s testimony. %$* 374
i was going to say, mark, thank you very much. %$* 374
we were on the same side and then i read his very persuasive testimony that he provided—testified before congress a few weeks ago. %$* 374
and he goes through point by point—and i’ll get to it in a moment—that the terror that we are facing, and how treacherous the shoals are that we are going to run up against in a very short order economically—and i said, my goodness, this is not working at all. %$* 374
and so, mark, thank you for persuading me. %$* 374
i will distribute it at the end of the day and you can all be-- %$* 374
i think you will vote our side once you have read mark’s testimony. %$* 374
i’m sure you will next time around. %$* 374
well, let me also say very clearly that the obama administration’s economic policies, in my mind, stand for continuity you can believe in. %$* 374
we are still giving away vast sums of money to the same people with the same result so the bank profits are way up, unemployment is up, “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” investment is not increasing, consumption is not increasing and we are not seeing any of the wise transformation in the fundamental structure of our economy that this crisis calls for. %$* 374
we all we all remember rahm emanuel’s often-cited statement that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. %$* 374
indeed, it is. %$* 374
this crisis is the rare opportunity that we have to change the direction of our economy, an economy that has been sliding in the wrong direction for many years. %$* 374
on that proposition we would all agree. %$* 374
and i think that larry used a very prescient metaphor of an apartment house that is burning down. %$* 374
and he would say that the obama administration came with fire hoses blazing and put out half of the fire. %$* 374
our perspective is they didn’t call the fire brigade from the next county, that they didn’t say, what can we do to stop the fire? %$* 374
what can we do from the air? %$* 374
how can we add other fire retardants to turn this off and make sure that there is not a fire next time around? %$* 374
and that is what we have to do, that failure structurally is what we are talking about. %$* 374
let’s deal with numbers just for a moment. %$* 374
and these are numbers from mark’s testimony. %$* 374
they are there out online, of course. %$* 374
these are irrefutable numbers. %$* 374
unemployment up to 17.5 percent, 26 million people, increasing at the rate of several “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” hundred thousand per month. %$* 374
yes, the 700,000 a month of that was when we were in free fall. %$* 374
right now we are still in free fall— two hundred thousand. %$* 374
there is not any affirmative news on the job front. %$* 374
and i will get to general motors in a moment in terms of what they stand for in terms of jobs. %$* 374
foreclosures: foreclosures are getting worse, not better. %$* 374
your testimony—and we all agree—2010 will be worse than 2009, which was worse than 2008. why? %$* 374
adjustable rate mortgages are going to reset next year. %$* 374
fewer and fewer home owners will be able to afford to make their mortgage payments. %$* 374
that crisis continues unabated. %$* 374
and one of the things the obama administration did not do that it should have done was push for the legislative power to give judges the power to reform mortgages in the bankruptcy context. %$* 374
i, at that point, when i saw that, i said, how could they not do this? %$* 374
it is fundamental, it is necessary, it is right. %$* 374
it would help the middle class that we supposedly care about most fundamentally. %$* 374
the number, by the way: foreclosures are up twenty-three percent this year over last year and it will get worse. %$* 374
commercial real estate, we care about it less, other than as it affects the banking community. %$* 374
you in your testimony say hundreds of banks will go bankrupt next year as a result of the mortgages in the commercial real estate sector that simply cannot be refinanced—grossly undervalued, still “obama’s economic polices are working effectively” accounting gimmicks. %$* 374
they are left, right and center. %$* 374
we have not faced to it. %$* 374
it will be a disaster. %$* 374
credit markets are dysfunctional. %$* 374
your word, we all agree with it. %$* 374
credit markets are dysfunctional. %$* 374
small, medium sized businesses cannot borrow, simply cannot borrow, even though we have given trillions of dollars to the megabanks that came crawling to washington, say, please, please, please, we can’t pay our bonuses. %$* 374
state and local we won’t even get into it cause i only have 2:52 left. %$* 374
the aig conduit payments to goldman, the 12.9 billion, 100 percent on the counter party payments—absolutely outrageous. %$* 374
tim geithner must explain this to the american public. %$* 374
absolutely outrageous. %$* 374
state and local governments will be going bankrupt. %$* 374
they are down ten, 15 percent in their revenues. %$* 374
we have handled it for one year. %$* 374
they will go over a precipice next year. %$* 374
that will lead to the full-time shutdown of school districts, fire districts, community services. %$* 374
that is where we are seeing it because property values will plummet, property revenues will plummet. %$* 374
sales tax revenue, real estate revenues—all dramatically down. %$* 374
general motors today—steve, you’re right. %$* 374
gm had better numbers today. %$* 374

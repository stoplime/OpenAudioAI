so you're just saying that we'll get over it, we'll get through this difficult time? %$* 13
no, it's going to hurt. %$* 189
gen y in particular has to find a new way of doing things because, let's be honest here, government is not going to lead the way in a private enterprise- driven system to whatever comes next. %$* 189
we didn't do it the last time around. %$* 189
we didn't do it the time before that. %$* 189
we're not going to do it this time around. %$* 189
and from my point of view, that's neither good nor bad. %$* 189
it just is. %$* 189
but jim brought up a comment that i really want to get back to on the dissolving of the u.s.dollar. %$* 189
into what? %$* 189
ever since the euro zone decided to confiscate insured bank deposits to bail out cyprus everyone moved out. %$* 189
what's left then? %$* 189
the yen, the yuan, less than 2 percent that's actually traded? %$* 189
that's right. %$* 18
you got the swiss franc and the canadian dollar are the next two. %$* 189
those cannot be a global currency. %$* 189
so the united states-- %$* 189
not suggesting for a heartbeat that i think printing currency is a good idea, but we are the only country in the world that can actually do it because, you know why? %$* 189
three quarters of it isn't even held here because it's a trade system. %$* 189
all right, let me give it to jim rickards. %$* 13
yeah, i'll respond to two points. %$* 191
there's an old saying, "you're entitled to your opinion. %$* 191
you're not entitled to your own facts." joe, i wish-- %$* 191
that comes up so often at our debates, actually. %$* 13
you know, joe, i really wish we were growing at 3 to 4 percent, as you said. %$* 191
the fact is in 2014, the u.s.economy grew at 2.4 percent growth. %$* 191
since the end of the recession, it's 2.2 percent. %$* 191
the debt is growing faster than that. %$* 191
we are going bankrupt. %$* 191
we are on the road to greece. %$* 191
so, those are the facts. %$* 191
now, on peter's point-- %$* 191
what's going bankrupt? %$* 188
just tell me again, who’s going bankrupt? %$* 188
well, okay, let's get to that. %$* 191
so this goes to peter's point, nobody's going to replace the dollar, you're right. %$* 191
it's not going to-- %$* 191
it's not going to be the yuan, peter, it's not going to be the yen, it's not going to be any of those kinds of things you mentioned. %$* 191
but i'll tell you what will replace the dollar and sooner than you think. %$* 191
the fed printed $4 trillion to get us through the last recession. %$* 191
what happened was they substituted public debt for private debt. %$* 191
so, you're right, the banks are propped up. %$* 191
but now all that debt's on the balance sheet of the fed. %$* 191
when the next liquidity crisis comes, what are they going to do, print another four trillion, eight trillion, 12 trillion? %$* 191
what is the confidence limit? %$* 191
there is only one clean balance sheet left in the world. %$* 191
when crisis comes, the world is going to be reliquified by the imf using the special drawing right, which has been around since 1969, sdr's world money-- %$* 191
and, by the way, china will have a big vote, the u.s.will lose its veto. %$* 191
that's how they're going to reliquify the world. %$* 191
so, by the way, we won't have it in our pockets. %$* 191
the dollars will be walking around money like mexican pesos or turkish lira, but the big stuff, the price of oil, balance of payments, that'll be in sdrs-- %$* 191
jim, i want to break in-- %$* 13
i want to move on to something specific that i heard the two sides clash on in their opening statements, and that was the part that education is playing in this debate. %$* 13
the team arguing to bet on america talked about the much vaunted american education system, and the opponents argued that there’re real problems with education. %$* 13
so, let's start with the opponents-- %$* 13
your argument about access to education in the middleclass. %$* 13
okay, so, first of all, there wasn't a point made, which i totally agree with, about the excellence of american elite universities. %$* 190
your universities are great. %$* 190
i went to harvard. %$* 190
i loved it. %$* 190
the problem with american education is it is a symptom of this wider problem of the hollowed out middle class. %$* 190
american education isn't delivering to the people at the bottom, in the middle. %$* 190
and that's-- %$* 190
you know, everyone in this room is going to agree with that. %$* 190
it's-- %$* 190
whether you're on the right or the left, you know that's the case. %$* 190
and in a winner- take-all economy, which is today's high tech economy, that means that social opportunity is being blocked, too. %$* 190
joe joffe. %$* 13
did you pay your way at harvard? %$* 188
no, i got scholarships. %$* 190
aha. %$* 188
from the province of alberta. %$* 190
let me give you a number-- %$* 188
60-- %$* 188
thank you, sandy taggert %$* 190
60 percent of the so-called elite universities, 60 percent of those students are getting scholarships in one way or another. %$* 188
this is probably the best ladder of advancement you can get is the so-called "american elite universities." when i look at these kids in my seminar at stanford, and i blame them for not knowing american history and then they all look up, and i see korea, china, india, and so on, so that is one thing. %$* 188
one other point, the next-- %$* 188
once people concede the best universities in the world, they say, "yes, but what about secondary education? %$* 188
"again, one has to look at the numbers. %$* 188
most americans don't know it, but there's an oecd-- %$* 188
regular oecd study called pisa, program of international student assessment. %$* 188
and, lo and behold, that maligned american high school, when it comes to reading and math skills, these kids are pretty much in the middle of the italians, french, israelis are far down, and germans. %$* 188
so, that american state school system, which has been maligned for the last hundred years, is delivering pretty good stuff, at least it is not as everybody thinks, at the rock bottom. %$* 188
okay, i'm going to go to the audience now for some questions. %$* 13
and how this works is if you raise your hand a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
we want you to not ask the question till you get the microphone to you and have it about the same distance from your mouth as this is from mine so that the radio broadcast can hear you and the podcast. %$* 13
and we'd like you to tell us your name and then be very, very terse in asking a question that keeps us on point. %$* 13
and i'm going to go right into the center, here. %$* 13
and if you can stand up, the mike will be brought down to you. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
once again, just tell us your name. %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 19
it's a question for the opposition. %$* 19
why does it matter that there is inequality if even the lowest are better off? %$* 19
so, if everyone has moved up, why does the inequality matter? %$* 19
okay, great question. %$* 13
who would like to take that? %$* 13
yeah, i'll take it. %$* 190
chrystia freeland. %$* 13
two reasons, first of all, strongest biggest problem is the middle is stagnant at both-- %$* 190
on income and on wealth. %$* 190
and employment is a real-- %$* 190
those good jobs for the middleclass are vanishing. %$* 190
that figure that i cited about comparing 20 to 50-year-old men in the u.s.and france, the fact that employment is lower in the u.s., that's a real issue. %$* 190
so that's the biggest reason. %$* 190
and inequality doesn't matter if the lowest are moving up, but they're not moving up. %$* 191
that's the problem. %$* 191
they're getting lower. %$* 191
that's the problem. %$* 191
do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
i would be happy to. %$* 18
that was sort of a question from your side, but go ahead. %$* 13
peter zeihan. %$* 13
those of you in gen y who have college bills, they suck. %$* 189
i totally relate. %$* 189
those of you who are in gen z, did you know that the cost of education if you don't go to harvard is probably going to drop by 90 percent by the time that you're in college because you'll be able to attend schools online? %$* 189
now, that's a problem if you're a college professor at the university of wisconsin, but if you're somebody who's an education consumer, you are on the verge of the fastest advancement in the educational quality ever in the history of this country. %$* 189
and you know what? %$* 189
no one planned it. %$* 189
now, would you like to respond to that or should i go to another question? %$* 13
i'd like to move on unless you're strong-- %$* 13
feel strongly. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
well, i'll just say, you know, those-- %$* 190
i think that technology transforming education is a terrific thing apart from the professors who are going to be laid off, but the real issue is, "what are going to be the jobs for those kids when they graduate? %$* 190
well, i don't know, but i don't-- %$* 189
that's the problem. %$* 190
that question in 1940 who knew what they were going to be in 1960. that's the whole point of change. %$* 189
it was a different phase in the technology revolution. %$* 190
we have to accept that it's not discontinuum. %$* 190
you know, the industrial revolution changed how the economy works. %$* 190
the technology revolution is doing the same thing and we're going to have to change how politics in society-- %$* 190
okay. %$* 13
we're getting repetitive on the point, so i want to move on to another question, sir. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 18
no, it's okay. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
i'm zachary karabell. %$* 18
this is a question for mr. %$* 18
rickards. %$* 18
so let's say i agreed with you that there is a high probability of a global synchronous economic collapse, which i don't, but if i did, in what way is that an indictment or proof of the statement that america is in decline rather than a separate debate about the tenuousness of the global financial system? %$* 18
well, it's like a school bus full of children heading for a cliff and america is the driver. %$* 191
in other words, you know, america is so much better off than the rest of the bus. %$* 191
the school bus driver is so much more mature than the kids in the back, but if you're going over the cliff you won't-- %$* 191
i don't dispute that when the dollar collapses the other countries will be right behind it, but this is about american leadership, which was chrystia's earlier point, which is that the rest of the world, you know-- %$* 191
the usa is missing in action in minsk today. %$* 191
we're missing in action in brussels where the greek eu negotiation was going on. %$* 191
there is no leadership from the united states. %$* 191
we are the largest economy in the world. %$* 191
we are the leader. %$* 191
we control the global financial system through the federal reserve. %$* 191
can i-- %$* 18
we're the ones driving the bus over the cliff. %$* 191
joe joffe. %$* 13
let me again try to bring this back to the issue of the debate. %$* 188
you can't prove the point about decline versus non-decline by anecdotes. %$* 188
now let's take the so-called withdrawal of the united states from the global arena, which by the way, is not exactly a liberal kind of critique, but more from the right, but it's true that under obama this country has withdrawn, whether it's minsk or brussels or pinsk or whatever. %$* 188
do you guys know where pinsk is? %$* 188
no. %$* 188
i do. %$* 188
i’ve been there-- %$* 190
so-- %$* 188
wait, wait, wait, wait. %$* 188
now the problem is here with these arguments is that we can or you can vote obama out of power in two years and this may change. %$* 188
the kind of long-term forces we keep talking about that europe suffers under, china suffers under, japan, you name it, cannot be decided or changed by vote and that's why i plead with you to keep anecdotes and trends apart. %$* 188
joe joffe, i don't understand why you say an argument can't be made by anecdote frankly. %$* 13
no . %$* 188
i mean, hitler rose to power and messed up germany. %$* 13
that's an anecdote and it's true. %$* 13
no, it's not. %$* 188
it's not because-- %$* 188
no, i'm sorry. %$* 188
to explain hitler's rise you have to go into heavy duty sociology and economics and history. %$* 188
anecdotes prove nothing. %$* 188
they just make good debating points. %$* 188
joe, if i'm-- %$* 13
i'm talking about friends and forces. %$* 188
chrystia freeland. %$* 13
joe, i-- %$* 191
i'm sorry. %$* 13
jim rickards. %$* 13
i took pains. %$* 191
i took pains to avoid anecdote. %$* 191
i used science. %$* 191
if hypersynchronous ising model is complexity theory. %$* 191
i was putting in the scientific space. %$* 191
we probably don't have time for the equations, but i was not using anecdotal evidence. %$* 191
i was telling you how collapses happen. %$* 191
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
i want to remind you we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
i love this audience. %$* 13
these questions have been great. %$* 13
sir, in the back there. %$* 13
keep the streak going. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 18
my name is nick. %$* 18
the four side described many of america's advantages. %$* 18
so, question for both sides. %$* 18
how are those advantages dependent or not dependent on our economic might that the other side argued quite heavily against? %$* 18
well, if i may say. %$* 188
if i'm allowed to repeat myself, some of the points i made have nothing to do with economic might. %$* 188
the power of immigration i'm talking about has nothing to do with it. %$* 188
the fact, what does it mean for somebody like sergey bryn to start google? %$* 188
it means the freedom to dream, invent, and invest. %$* 188
it means rule of law. %$* 188
it means property rights. %$* 188
it means no barriers to competition. %$* 188
that's why this russian- born kid did google here and not in st. %$* 188
petersburg. %$* 188
sounds like an anecdote to me. %$* 13
no. %$* 188
no. %$* 188
the anecdote made a very important point. %$* 188
when i talk about the rule of law, that's not an anecdote. %$* 188
okay. %$* 13
let's let the other side respond. %$* 13
chrystia freeland. %$* 13
that's an excellent question, and it gives me a chance to make a point that i really wanted to make around the immigration and demographics argument. %$* 190
i agree-- %$* 190
those are tremendous strengths. %$* 190
and i think the 21st century is going to be won by countries that are open to immigration and are feminist, and therefore are able to have demographic growth. %$* 190
what i'm worried about with the u.s. on-- %$* 190
and they're related, is when it comes to immigration, you guys are divided, and you're fighting about it. %$* 190
you know, would sergey brin get into the united states today? %$* 190
there is a huge immigration crisis in the u.s.with millions of undocumented immigrants. %$* 190
and your country can't decide whether to keep them and give them status or to kick them out. %$* 190
that, to me, is not a country which is united around what i believe joe correctly points out to be the virtues of immigration. %$* 190
but i think you're incredibly divided and torn on precisely this issue. %$* 190
so, i see the american debate, and you know, frankly the american paralysis-- %$* 190
gridlock, if you will, around immigration as a measure of decline. %$* 190
okay. %$* 13
let's have-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 18
peter zeihan respond. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 189
on the immigration debate, we are divided. %$* 189
but if you look around the wider world, you're right. %$* 189
there isn't that division, because most of them say, "no." and the ones that don't say "hell no"-- %$* 189
the united states has the third largest foreign-born in the world-- %$* 189
canada, of course, is number 1.the united kingdom is number 2.you know, there are some commonalities here. %$* 189
but i want to talk about something a little bit more structural that i think might help with that argument. %$* 189
moving stuff from a to b is really hard, but if you move it on water, it's 1/12th the cost. %$* 189
the united states has more miles of interconnected, navigable waterways than the rest of the planet put together. %$* 189
peter, i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to cut you off there because that's not really to the question. %$* 13
i want to go back to questions. %$* 13
sir, right up behind-- %$* 13
behind you, actually. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
my name is hans. %$* 18
why is moral power not on the table for this debate, specifically as it relates to foreign policy? %$* 18
can you-- %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
as far as the measures of power that the team arguing in favor-- %$* 18
well, you're asking why isn't it on the table. %$* 13
and that's not a question that's going to get them to this-- %$* 13
that's a different-- %$* 13
think about a way to-- %$* 13
i'm going to go on to another question. %$* 13
if we have time, i'll come back-- %$* 13
and i do mean it-- %$* 13
a way to get them to actually be debating the issue of moral power. %$* 13
down in the front here, sir. %$* 13
john tierney. %$* 18
i've got a question for the opposition, for ms. %$* 18
freeland. %$* 18
the economy tends to grow faster in times when you have divided government in washington. %$* 18
so, my question is, what's the problem with gridlock? %$* 18
the reason that i cited the brookings survey is to show-- %$* 190
it's easy to argue it's actually not different this time. %$* 190
and the reason i cited that brookings study is i think it's qualitatively different if you can argue that compared to 65 years ago, it's twice as hard to get legislation passed. %$* 190
this is not a sort of healthy divided government, where the parties are coming together and making deals. %$* 190
this is a government where you're actually voting to stop funding the government. %$* 190
is that how an adult country runs itself? %$* 190
would the other side like to respond? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
sir, do you want to try again? %$* 13
did you want to give another shot at the moral question? %$* 13
i'll answer, john. %$* 18
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 13
i wanted to-- %$* 13
i actually wanted to give the other side a chance, unless you strongly feel so-- %$* 13
would you like to respond to that point? %$* 13
well, we're not an adult country. %$* 189
we're a young country. %$* 189
are we making mistakes? %$* 189
yeah. %$* 189
do we make the most of our gifts? %$* 189
of course not. %$* 189
but how much better than everybody else do you have to be? %$* 189
all right. %$* 13
let me bring it back to jim rickards. %$* 13
i left the moral part of it out of the argument because i was trying to do some less obvious things. %$* 191
a country that celebrates the degradation of "fifty shades of gray" is way past the point of declinance %$* 191
okay. %$* 13
have you seen-- %$* 188
i've got to pass on it-- %$* 13
have you seen the hit this movie has made in europe? %$* 188
right down in front here. %$* 13
that's relative decline, joe. %$* 191
dana, how are we on time? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
right down in front here. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
this is for the pro team. %$* 19
it seems to me like-- %$* 19
for the motion, bet on america? %$* 13
for the motion. %$* 19
it seems to me-- %$* 19
and i could be wrong-- %$* 19
that many of the world indexes today still rank the u.s. as 23rd or below most industrialized nations in pretty significant markers of quality of life, including infant mortality, mortality rates, homicide-- %$* 19
which, in the usdi for example, is about 1 percent higher than syria right now-- %$* 19
literacy, health-- %$* 19
healthcare markers, science and math test rankings. %$* 19
so, my question to you is how do you factor that into the argument that the u.s. in large measure has not been in a state of decline, if not disgrace, for some time. %$* 19
joe, do you want to take that one? %$* 13
joe joffe. %$* 13
look, you want disgrace, you can have disgrace. %$* 188
but you can have the disgrace. %$* 188
i mean, the-- %$* 188
some of the numbers that you mentioned are right. %$* 188
the homicide-- %$* 188
by the way, homicide in this country has gone done enormously since the '90s, but that won't convince-- %$* 188
the infant mortality, high, we can explain it, but that's not the point. %$* 188
the point is what kind of standards are you setting here? %$* 188
wait, why aren't-- %$* 13
right, but-- %$* 13
but why isn't that the point? %$* 13
but why isn't that the point? %$* 13
and you need to explain that. %$* 13
no, i don't-- %$* 188
i-- %$* 188
you can't simply assert what you say are the standards here. %$* 13
you need to explain to her why her standards don't %$* 13
you're taking sides. %$* 188
i'm sorry you're taking sides. %$* 188
no, no, i'm asking to preserve the integrity of the debate, here. %$* 13
she asked a fair question, and i'm asking you to explain-- %$* 13
rather than dismiss her standards, please tell her why her standards are not relevant. %$* 13
i was going to talk about it, but you interrupted me. %$* 188
all right. %$* 13
you're true, i-- %$* 13
that's true, i did, and-- %$* 13
and you keep interrupting us. %$* 188
anyway-- %$* 188
it's my job. %$* 13
i can set any kind of standard which no country, no person can live up to. %$* 188
does the united states have flaws? %$* 188
of course it has flaws. %$* 188
it had tons of flaws. %$* 188
but it has nothing to do-- %$* 188
this is not an issue-- %$* 188
this is a moral issue which this country must fight and wrestle with but has nothing to do with the issue of decline or not decline. %$* 188
this is moral failure but not a power failure and we are talking about decline-- %$* 188
is about power and not about going to church. %$* 188
okay, you did answer my question. %$* 13
sir, in the back there. %$* 13
yes, my name is cliff. %$* 18
and this question is for both sides. %$* 18
the united states was founded as a free market capitalist society. %$* 18
we were founded as a constitutional republic. %$* 18
how do you see how-- %$* 18
today from over the last 300 years, have we moved closer to that-- %$* 18
to those ideals or have we moved further away? %$* 18
and how does that answer the question as to whether we're in decline or not? %$* 18
i'll let the second person-- %$* 13
there's-- %$* 191
i'd say there's nothing left-- %$* 191
there are no markets left. %$* 191
what you have is theater. %$* 191
you have the appearance of markets. %$* 191
prices and things move around, but the fed is manipulating the price of money. %$* 191
money is the common denominator for every market. %$* 191
so when you suppress it and keep it at zero-- %$* 191
by the way, what's the impact of that? %$* 191
when you keep interest rates at zero, so let’s say some of your saving accounts or, you know, my mom has some money in the bank, they get zero. %$* 191
they get zero. %$* 191
the other side of that trade is if you're jpmorgan and you're jamie dimon, you're paying zero for your cost of funds. %$* 191
you can go out and buy some ten year notes 10 to one and make 20 percent returns on equity. %$* 191
that is a $400 billion per year wealth transfer from everyday americans to the power elite to the richest bankers. %$* 191
that's america today. %$* 191
so we have no markets left. %$* 191
peter zeihan. %$* 13
the founding fathers developed the political system for a largely agrarian coastal community. %$* 189
the fact that we have evolved so much from that and still have the oldest constitution in the world i think is a sign of incredible flexibility and strength on our part, and, god forbid me for saying this, even on the part of our political leadership. %$* 189
the space that we have is a big part of that on both sides. %$* 189
it also speaks to the question on standards. %$* 189
we're the least urbanized of the industrialized countries. %$* 189
so everything that we do for a city that we then have to do it for a constellation of a thousand small towns that still have autonomy, that is a degree of political self-determination that doesn't exist in any other political system on the planet, and i think that's admirable. %$* 189
can we-- %$* 188

can we compare the united states with the united states? %$* 188
i mean, when we talk about moral turpitude or failure, what-- %$* 188
how would we rate what followed the crime of slavery in the '60s when i was in college when we took over city hall for civil rights issues and stuff like that? %$* 188
hasn't this country done a hell of a good job in-- %$* 188
with the civil rights act, the voting rights act, bringing previously downtrodden and discriminated people up to turn them into real citizens? %$* 188
is that not the kind of moral achievement or what is this? %$* 188
if we think in terms of inequality, which is to obtain in this country when there was a anglo wasp overclass ruling over others, and now one group after another being emancipated and made full citizens, is that moral failure or what is that? %$* 188
all right, chrystia freeland, the argument that there's moral success, moral fiber. %$* 13
so, i think we're all going to agree that ending slavery is a good thing. %$* 190
i think we'll probably all agree-- %$* 190
no, no, no, but that was-- %$* 13
that's dismissing the point. %$* 13
no, no, but i'm going to continue. %$* 190
okay. %$* 13
i think we're all going to agree also that making women citizens and giving us the right to vote and participate fully is a good thing. %$* 190
and i would add-- %$* 190
because i do think there has been a rights revolution, not just in the united states, but around at least the western world. %$* 190
and i think the fact that lesbian and gay people have increasingly full rights, although they did have the right to marry in canada in 2005, is a really important and great thing. %$* 190
but we can't ignore ferguson and the protests and "hands up, don't shoot." there is still an american underclass, and that underclass today is feeling deeply oppressed partly by the economic circumstances that i was talking about. %$* 190
and the american moral obligation to constantly advance this rights revolution is one reason why i am so agitated about dwindling economic opportunity in the middle and the bottom. %$* 190
i want to let the other side respond first. %$* 13
yeah, sure, don't get me wrong. %$* 18
ferguson was bad. %$* 18
one happens in brazil every eight hours. %$* 18
i mean, yes, getting shot in the street is bad. %$* 18
want to live in gaza? %$* 18
sure, political representation is difficult sometimes. %$* 18
how about the fact that a lot of what snowden stole is being used by the russians to monitor and destroy communications networks across the russian federation right now? %$* 18

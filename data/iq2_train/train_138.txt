as a union leader, i see what collective bargaining does for a school in a school system. %$* 404
is that a "yes"? %$* 13
i-- %$* 404
no, it's-- %$* 404
i think it's a complicated question to answer honestly. %$* 404
no, to answer honestly. %$* 404
i believe in unionism. %$* 404
and i believe that-- %$* 404
a lot of the charter schools are for profit. %$* 404
and i think that unions help keep the ideals of american values in our schools. %$* 404
that is my honest answer. %$* 404
what is an american value? %$* 407
actually, i want to come to you, randi, but i want to give larry a chance just to keep this evenhanded. %$* 13
now we'll come-- %$* 13
in addition, you're talking about choice. %$* 407
it's very interesting. %$* 407
in the big cities, 40 percent of public school teachers send their own children to private schools which are not unionized. %$* 407
what does that tell you? %$* 407
randi weingarten. %$* 13
in the united states congress about 35 percent of united states congress sent their children to private schools also. %$* 405
randi weingarten. %$* 13
i don't. %$* 404
the overwhelming number of teachers opt to join a union because whether it's in new york state or other places, everyone has a choice as to whether or not to join a union, and ultimately-- %$* 402
people-- %$* 402
they do. %$* 402
randi, randi, randi, randi. %$* 405
excuse me. %$* 402
let's let randi finish her point, and i'll come to you, rod. %$* 13
legally everyone has the choice. %$* 402
in new york city they have the choice. %$* 402
all over the country they have the choice. %$* 402
they may not have the choice about whether or not to pay for the services the union renders but they have the choice to join the union. %$* 402
and in new york city 96 percent of the people who teach in new york city opt to join the union. %$* 402
now, the issue around the country-- %$* 402
and i believe the same way as kate, i had lots of opportunities in my life to do lots of different things, i chose not only to be a teacher but i chose to be a union representative. %$* 402
i chose to do this because i believe in my heart and in my soul that what unions do for kids and for teachers as well as for working people is to lift all boats. %$* 402
i said this initially. %$* 402
i said, "we are not perfect, just like superintendents aren't perfect, secretaries of education aren't perfect-- %$* 402
" "-- %$* 402
presidents of the united states of america aren't perfect, but at the end of the day, if you look at the historic record, when the unions had the kind of clout they used to have in this country, we had a vibrant middle class." what we are trying to do as a trade union movement is to insure that kids get the services that they need and to insure that teachers get what they need to do a good job. %$* 402
terry moe. %$* 13
the last part of that, can that not be true, in fact? %$* 403
because that-- %$* 403
but respond to her point. %$* 13
well, what was the point that you want me to respond to? %$* 403
which point-- %$* 13
because she made a lot of points. %$* 403
her last point was that creating a situation where teachers are protected and comfortable, safe, and kate had also earlier made the point, safe from various kinds of vicissitudes of administration, that they can take chances in the classroom, that they can do all of those things, that they have some sort of protection. %$* 13
and there's a logic to that, and i'd like you to respond to it. %$* 13
i think that-- %$* 403
first of all there are laws against arbitrary treatment, against discrimination, and so on, that just apply to workers generally. %$* 403
and so what i would like to hear is why it is that teachers are so vulnerable to these things that they're a special category of people in the united states, that they of all these people deserve to have a job for life, so that they can't be fired for incompetence. %$* 403
well, teachers shouldn't have a job for life. %$* 402
and they should be fired for incompetence. %$* 402
the issue, and i said this a couple of months ago in a speech that neither you, nor larry, nor rod have actually acknowledged in the work that you've-- %$* 402
or the statements you've made today, we want to have valid and reliable evaluation systems. %$* 402
teachers do not like when they are just simply thrown the keys and told, "do it." there are many of us when we first started teaching who had real frustrations in terms of not being able to connect to kids, not knowing how to do the things we needed to do. %$* 402
and ultimately what we've yearned for is to have real development and evaluation programs. %$* 402
and, in fact, larry, i said just two months ago, student learning must count as part of teacher evaluation, and ultimately what the abc school district is doing, what actually the central falls school district was doing before the teachers were fired en masse was to try and create these evaluation systems that arne duncan and i have both said are really required. %$* 402
terry moe, or do you-- %$* 13
terry, do you want to cede to your partner, larry, because, larry, i thought you had your hand up-- %$* 13
if i'm wrong-- %$* 13
well, i was actually-- %$* 407
larry sand. %$* 13
i was going to address another issue of randi's that she made earlier or-- %$* 407
sure. %$* 13
okay-- %$* 407
just briefly what it was? %$* 13
well, she said 96 percent of teachers, i believe, choose to be in the union in new york, is that-- %$* 407
i'm saying in new york city. %$* 402
right-- %$* 407
okay. %$* 407
if you are interested in a real choice-- %$* 407
for people who don't know, new york is a non-right to work state, which essentially means you have to join the union, as is california. %$* 407
that's actually not true, larry. %$* 402
okay, let me finish, randi, please. %$* 407
in california you pay $1,000 a year to the union. %$* 407
it's actually even a little more than that. %$* 407
if you opt out of the union you don't get a choice to opt in, if you opt out you get back about $300 dollars. %$* 407
$700 dollars still goes to the union whether you want it or not. %$* 407
it’s like getting a divorce from your wife that you never wanted to marry the first place and you’re still paying alimony. %$* 407
let’s go to one more question. %$* 13
on this side, yellow shirt. %$* 13
and i really hope it’s good because you may be our last question. %$* 13
and make it a question. %$* 13
as everyone stated on this side of the table that the real meaning or purpose behind the unions is to look out for the kids, if something were to benefit the kids in any of your school districts, but it meant approving a salary reduction, would you vote for that salary reduction? %$* 31
a lot of unions have done that. %$* 402
and what we’re seeing is-- %$* 402
what we’ve seen is, i know i’ve negotiated when i was in new york city, as did my predecessor sandy feldman; we negotiated deferral agreements; we negotiated-- %$* 402
we just negotiated changes in pensions in order to save money for kids. %$* 402
i know. %$* 402
okay randi, i want to move so please state your point that the answer is yes, it does happen. %$* 13
purple sweater? %$* 13
i’d like to address all three, to the panel again. %$* 31
on which side? %$* 13
ma’am, which side? %$* 13
to the side against unions. %$* 31
okay. %$* 13
if you could discuss who are the gatekeepers to who becomes teachers, because it is not the unions. %$* 31
and how do you feel about charter schools using public spaces? %$* 31
and larry, bob’s movie “the cartel” also implicates state government, but mr. %$* 31
page, i would dare say, mr. %$* 31
bush’s friends the ctb, mcgraw-hill testing company, %$* 31
okay unions. %$* 13
can you rephrase your first question please? %$* 13
the first on your list, can you rephrase that? %$* 13
how do you feel about who are the gatekeepers to who becomes teachers; it is not the unions. %$* 31
okay, i think that’s the most relevant to our topic. %$* 13
does anybody want to-- %$* 13
who will be-- %$* 403
if you have a problem, who do you go to, is that your question? %$* 403
no. %$* 31
what’s the gatekeeper-- %$* 403
i don’t understand-- %$* 403
how do they become-- %$* 31
does board of ed let them in? %$* 31
the people who are bad teachers; some of them apparent when they go for interviews. %$* 31
some of them are apparent on paper. %$* 31
i see-- %$* 31
okay we have the question, who gets to choose who gets hired as a teacher. %$* 13
are you saying if not the union or it’s not the union. %$* 13
it’s not the union. %$* 31
it’s not the union. %$* 13
all right i think her point is that the bad teachers aren’t because the unions are there; the bad teachers are in the system because the school administration hired them in the first place, therefore bad teachers are not the union’s fault. %$* 13
rod page. %$* 13
yes, making these decisions are really difficult decisions and we want the universities to do better. %$* 405
we want the administrators to do better. %$* 405
but once the situation has been proven, that this is a sub-par teacher, then we want to have some system to remove the teacher from the environment because we know that it’s not a good idea to have a teacher who’s not competent in front of children. %$* 405
that’s the only reason for that. %$* 405
another question, i think we have time for one more. %$* 13
green sweater. %$* 13
so i guess, one of them is a very quick question. %$* 31
only one question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 31
choose. %$* 13
so we talked a lot about unions defending teachers who we thought were less than competent. %$* 31
is it the fault of the union that they’re defending them and availing them of their rights or that there’s a system that means that they’re actually successful at doing so? %$* 31
i actually didn’t understand the question. %$* 13
but i think there’s something there and i want to make sure our audience-- %$* 13
i guess the question would be, we don’t blame defense lawyers for defending their clients because we have a judicial system that allows for prosecutors and defense lawyers. %$* 31
similarly, should we blame unions for defend-- %$* 31
for availing themselves of their rights to defend their constituents and not-- %$* 31
let me that. %$* 13
and i thank you for that question because that was the biggest myth for me as a new teacher. %$* 404
i too thought oh, teachers unions keep bad teachers around them. %$* 404
as i became a building rep and now the vice president, i’ve seen these cases actually pan out. %$* 404
and it’s exactly what you said; due process is not an easy thing to defend to people. %$* 404
and it’s like you said, i mean the defense lawyer didn’t murder the person. %$* 404
but somehow it seems that unions are taking the rap for the actions of someone else when they’re actually defending the due process. %$* 404
and in the actual case, i’ll give you an example, this is what floored me when i learned about this. %$* 404
can i just say one thing? %$* 404
you can’t grieve opinion. %$* 404
so in the case of a principal writing something, and giving a teacher an unsatisfactory-- %$* 404
teachers unions can only talk about the procedures that happened. %$* 404
we actually can't defend the work of a bad teacher. %$* 404
larry sand. %$* 13
we defend procedure which is exactly-- %$* 404
point made. %$* 13
and larry sand. %$* 13
okay. %$* 407
very quickly, to answer your question, sir, yeah, they act as defense lawyers. %$* 407
i agree with you. %$* 407
but they also make the rules. %$* 407
they make the laws. %$* 407
so it seems to me to be a conflict of interest. %$* 407
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each of our debaters. %$* 13
they will get two minutes each. %$* 13
after that, you will be asked to vote on where you stand on the motion. %$* 13
this will be your last chance. %$* 13
this will be their last chance to change your minds on our motion, which is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
we asked you to vote before the debate began, and reminding you of the results we got, the motion, don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
those for the motion who stand by teachers unions: 24 percent. %$* 13
those against the motion, who blame teachers unions: 43 percent. %$* 13
those undecided were 33 percent. %$* 13
we will ask you to vote once again and pick the winner right after the closing statements which will begin now as we start round three, closing statements, two minutes each. %$* 13
and to lead off against the motion: larry sand, retired teacher and president of the california teachers empowerment network. %$* 13
okay, thank you, john. %$* 407
and thank you, mr. %$* 407
rosenkranz, i think this is a wonderful forum, and i'm very appreciative to be a part of it. %$* 407
yesterday, march 15th was a day of reckoning for many teachers across the country. %$* 407
in a bad economy, that's when the letters of possible layoffs also known as rifs, reduction in force notices, go out to all teachers-- %$* 407
go out to teachers who might be losing their job. %$* 407
in my school's retirement lunch last june-- %$* 407
there were more than retirees saying goodbye. %$* 407
we lost several of the hardest working, most effective and popular young teachers on campus. %$* 407
several teachers-- %$* 407
we all know who they are. %$* 407
the kids know, the parents know, the teachers know-- %$* 407
should have been the ones saying goodbye. %$* 407
but because of the union mandated seniority rules, they weren't. %$* 407
as a parent, a grandparent or just a fair-minded person, don't you want your child, any child, to be taught by the best teacher, not the longest employed teacher? %$* 407
of course you do. %$* 407
but that is not what happened in my school and other schools around the country. %$* 407
yes, the teachers unions are not the only problems with public education today, but the extent of the damage they have caused cannot be exaggerated. %$* 407
in closing, to show you how the twisted the situation really is, what could be more preposterous than this: they go to great lengths to keep the misdirected and other sexual predators in the classroom. %$* 407
the union hounded jaime escalante, one of the greatest teachers of our time, out of the classroom and more recently destroyed the hopes and dreams of thousands of poor children in washington, d.c.please join us in sending the teachers unions a resounding message and vote no on your ballot. %$* 407
thank you. %$* 407
thank you, larry sand. %$* 13
our motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
and summarizing his position for the possession motion standing by teachers unions is gary smuts who is superintendent of the abc united school district in california. %$* 13
abc unified. %$* 406
pardon me. %$* 13
let me reintroduce it so i have it correct. %$* 13
did i say abc news? %$* 13
it comes out sometimes. %$* 13
gary smuts, superintendent of the abc united school district in california. %$* 13
did i get it wrong again? %$* 13
you got it wrong again, but that's okay. %$* 406
you know why, because i'm reading incorrect copy. %$* 13
abc unified school district. %$* 406
we were separate school districts. %$* 406
we all came together. %$* 406
all right. %$* 13
superintendent of the abc unified school district in california. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 406
thanks for the correction. %$* 406
accountability, innovation, standards, high achievement, teacher training, teacher performance measured by student achievement, these are hallmarks of the modern teachers union. %$* 406
now some teachers unions aren't modern. %$* 406
but those that are do these things. %$* 406
it is implied that the teachers union or non- unionon is the only veritable here. %$* 406
and they've tried to use weasel words to get out of that. %$* 406
oh, not all of them or some of them. %$* 406
but the case is if you look at the proposition, you have to blame teachers unions, i guess in each and every case. %$* 406
you have to deny poverty, poor budgets, lack of parental support, poor boards, poor state leadership, poor superintendent. %$* 406
you have to say none of those things count and only teachers union counts. %$* 406
they know that's not true, and they've said so. %$* 406
so you can't blame-- %$* 406
just blame teachers unions. %$* 406
and you know that. %$* 406
there's a lot reasons schools don't work. %$* 406
and it's not just teachers unions. %$* 406
professor moe said that teachers unions are major obstacles to school improvement. %$* 406
everywhere? %$* 406
not in my district. %$* 406
so the proposition isn't true in my district. %$* 406
it isn't true in kate's district. %$* 406
it isn't true in a lot of districts. %$* 406
and you've got to be fair about that. %$* 406
it's not true in a lot of school districts. %$* 406
professor moe pointed out that principals, 90 percent of them said they can't get rid of bad teachers. %$* 406
that's not a very good system. %$* 406
why not work with teachers unions to get rid of bad teachers? %$* 406
that's what randi weingarten wants to do. %$* 406
magnet schools work better than charters. %$* 406
i'm all for magnet schools. %$* 406
but the aft's not against magnet-- %$* 406
charter schools, either. %$* 406
larry sand told us a lot of stories from band camp. %$* 406
i don't think that that's a good reason to say teachers unions are bad, by sharing horror stories from individual places throughout the united states. %$* 406
being a superintendent is a hot, sweaty business. %$* 406
and it's hard enough doing it by yourself. %$* 406
but i'd much rather work as a superintendent with my colleagues from the american federation of teachers to increase student achievement. %$* 406
abc unified school district. %$* 406
we were separate school districts. %$* 406
we all came together. %$* 406
you got it wrong again, but that's okay. %$* 406
abc unified. %$* 406
thank you, gary smuts. %$* 13
our motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
here to argue against the motion, blaming teachers unions is rod paige, former us secretary of education and cofounder of the chartwell education group. %$* 13
well, i think i want to be clear. %$* 405
we all know that teachers unions are not solely to blame for our failing schools. %$* 405
we would never argue that. %$* 405
what we are arguing is the way the motion is put, that the only option that you have in order to express the idea that teachers unions bear significant responsibility for the inability to reform our schools now. %$* 405
and so we are encouraging you to vote no. %$* 405
teacher unions draw the ability to serve, to protect the interest of their members from their ability to convince the public that they are really about the kids. %$* 405
they are very good at hiding their real intent. %$* 405
they draw their power and ability to get the public to believe that there are some persons in some groups that they are not. %$* 405
they are not who they say they are. %$* 405
who they say they are is not who they really are. %$* 405
who they really are are mammoth organizations, highly financed, the most powerful political organizations in the united states of america. %$* 405
so you need to see them in that way. %$* 405
and we think they deserve your vote against the motion because they do bear significant responsibility for the condition of our schools. %$* 405
thank you, rod paige. %$* 13
summarizing for the motion standing up for teachers unions and arguing against our motion, don't blame teachers unions for-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, arguing for our motion, don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools, kate mclaughlin, an elementary teacher in lowell, massachusetts, who is executive vice president of the united teachers of lowell, no. %$* 13
495, which is a local of the aft. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 404
it's interesting because i can't help but take this personally because i am a union leader, and i am a proud union member. %$* 404
and i'm telling that you i'm speaking with the utmost candor that the kids come first to me and to my union president. %$* 404
the unions are the members, the people in the union, they are not these powerful organizations that secretary paige will have you believe. %$* 404
yes, there are-- %$* 404
there are political implications to what we do because we are advocating for the things that our children need; stable housing, healthcare and access to great and wonderful schools. %$* 404
so i would ask that you see the people on this panel as people who are actually doing this work on the ground level and working with our administrations to make our school systems better. %$* 404
we are the conduit for our teachers. %$* 404
our teachers tell us what they need in their classrooms, and we collect this information, and we work together with our superintendent and other central office personnel to make it happen. %$* 404
that is the purpose of the united teachers of lowell. %$* 404
there are other aspects to what we do, yes. %$* 404
we protect due process rights, yes. %$* 404
that is one area. %$* 404
but what we do is maintain an attractive profession so that we can get the very best teachers teaching in our schools for the benefit of the students. %$* 404
thank you. %$* 404
thank you, kate mclaughlin. %$* 13
arguing against the motion; arguing that teachers unions are at fault: terry moe, the william bennett monroe professor of political science at stanford university and senior fellow at the hoover institution. %$* 13
well, i think it's important here at the end to just focus on the big picture. %$* 403
and the big picture is very simple, and it's very devastating. %$* 403
here is what it comes down to. %$* 403
the teachers unions are by far the most powerful groups in american education. %$* 403
and they use their power mainly to protect jobs. %$* 403
and what they say is that there is really no conflict between protecting jobs and doing what's best for kids. %$* 403
but there are conflicts, lots of them, and as a result we can't get bad teachers out of the classroom, the schools are burdened with truly perverse organizations, and fundamental reforms, good reforms that make sense for kids, are resisted and undermined and weakened. %$* 403
so these are just basic facts. %$* 403
our opponents say that they want reforms too, that they want to get bad teachers out of the classroom. %$* 403
we've heard that several times that they want choice, that they want accountability, and my response is, "hey, it's 2010. where’ve you been? %$* 403
if you wanted to get bad teachers out of the classroom, why didn't you do it 30 years ago? %$* 403
why do we have all these protections and state laws? %$* 403
why weren't they aggressive about it 30 years ago? %$* 403
why are we even talking about it now? %$* 403
" same thing with choice and accountability, they could have been aggressive in supporting these things, pushing for more choice, pushing for accountability. %$* 403
the reason we don't have them is that they've been opposing them. %$* 403
so again, what counts is not what you say, it's what you do. %$* 403
so here's the bottom line. %$* 403
you have an opportunity to show tonight where you stand, and so you can send a message about this issue to the unions and you can send a message to the nation as a whole. %$* 403
so please do that. %$* 403
please vote, "no," on this proposal. %$* 403
it's important. %$* 403
thank you, terry moe. %$* 13
our motion is, “don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools," and finally, to argue for that motion, standing by the teachers, randi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers, the country's second largest teachers' union. %$* 13
when i think about what we're doing here tonight, i don't think about it as a debate on this motion and who wins or loses this motion. %$* 402
i think about the kids that i taught at clara barton high school. %$* 402
i think about the millions of kids in this country who, but for public education, will not have a chance at life. %$* 402
i think about the thousands and thousands of teachers who are isolated in individual classrooms and who, frankly, have no interest in the status quo and who join a union or stay in a union because they want voice in how their kids get a decent education. %$* 402
i have been in three schools a week when i was the president of the united teachers in new york city. %$* 402
and i have been in over 50 places in the united states in the last year and a half since i've been the president of the american federation of teachers. %$* 402
i wish i had that magic wand that would magically help all of our students achieve to the global standards we wish right now. %$* 402
but i can tell you, the folks who are on the other side of the stage and the folks in the audience, that this union, under our watch, and you see the examples from both what gary said, who happens to be the superintendent of the year in california, as well as what kate says, who every single day is teaching children as well as doing her union work, we want what children need, we want to make every single school a school where parents want to send their kids and educators want to work, and we've learned a heck of a lot in the last few years about what works for kids, how to insure that we have well supported and well prepared teachers even if we have to do the hard work of saying to people, "you don't belong in this profession," how to have an engaged curriculum, how to work with parents better, and how to make sure that kids have the decent services that they need. %$* 402
randi weingarten, your time is up. %$* 13
what we're asking-- %$* 402
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes this symposium. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you right now to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
it will register your vote. %$* 13
and we're going to get the readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
our motion is, "don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools." if you are for the motion, if you stand with teachers' unions or at least don't blame them, push number one. %$* 13
if you are against the motion, you do blame teachers' unions, press number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, remain undecided, or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and while that's happening, and while the votes are being locked in and tabulated, the first thing i want to do is thank our panel for an amazingly impassioned and informed debate. %$* 13
you all are terrific. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i'd also like to thank those in the audience who came up with questions, even those that we didn't use or that got chopped. %$* 13
we seriously appreciate your willingness to be involved in this and for all of you for voting and for being part of the evening, very vocally in fact. %$* 13
so we’ll hear of the vote result shortly. %$* 13
a few things i want to announce about what’s upcoming. %$* 13

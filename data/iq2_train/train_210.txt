true or false: clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery. %$* 13
well, let’s have it out. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university where we have two teams of debaters, two against two. %$* 13
they include a governor and investor in green energy, a thinker on green energy, and a writer on the topic. %$* 13
they will be trying to change your minds because this is a debate. %$* 13
it is not a seminar or a panel discussion. %$* 13
it is a contest, a contest of ideas and logic and well-presented arguments. %$* 13
in this case, you, our live audience, are our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again at the end of the debate. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the arguing will be declared our winners. %$* 13
so let’s go to register your first vote on the motion. %$* 13
our motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you’re undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you feel you’ve made a mistake, just correct your mistake, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
i just want to ask-- %$* 13
technically, i have a problem with the wire into my ear, and i’m hearing delightful music, so-- %$* 13
so i’ve pulled it out. %$* 13
so we’re going to take a little bit of a break. %$* 13
in san francisco and washington, i understand they’re actually in a restaurant, so, at this point, while we’re doing this, you can all move on to the hors d'oeuvres. %$* 13
can i just get a test from the truck that i can-- %$* 13
yeah, i hear you clearly, terrifically. %$* 13
okay, we’re all back in business again. %$* 13
so you’ve now voted. %$* 13
that has been locked in, and at the end of the debate, you’ll vote again after the closing arguments, and very quickly we will have the results. %$* 13
so, our motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” on to round one: opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and debating first for the motion, i’d like to introduce bill ritter, former governor of colorado whose state has the fourth highest concentration of clean energy workers in the country. %$* 13
he’s now director of the center for the new energy economy at colorado state university. %$* 13
and bill, i think, with a resume like that, america wants to know what kind of car does a former governor of colorado drive? %$* 13
that’s a great question. %$* 551
i have four kids, my wife, family of six. %$* 551
so, i have a lot of options. %$* 551
we have our own fleet. %$* 551
i did just, because i’m commuting, buy a 1999 saab that gets a little over 30 miles to the gallon. %$* 551
so, you’re putting your money where your mouth is. %$* 13
i was driven for four years in a row so i had to do something other than find a driver. %$* 551
it’s nice to be driven. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, bill ritter. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 551
and thank you for being here tonight to discuss what i think is one of the most important issues that we have, really, as a nation facing us. %$* 551
you know, americans are not a group of people that sit out a revolution. %$* 551
if you think about our founding and where we come from, we began with a revolution, the american revolutionary war. %$* 551
and there have been a few revolutions in our time as well that americans have not just participated in, but they’ve led. %$* 551
think about the industrial revolution where we established really our ability to be an economic powerhouse. %$* 551
or, more recently, the information revolution where we reaffirmed in the minds of the world our ability as innovators and creators and inventors, people who really understand the power of technological development. %$* 551
what is this revolution that is upon us now? %$* 551
it is the clean energy revolution. %$* 551
and it’s global. %$* 551
and the question we have before us as americans is will we lead or will we follow? %$* 551
will we accept a place on the sidelines, or will we actively participate in moving this issue ahead? %$* 551
tonight i’m joined by kassia yanosek, who’s my partner in this. %$* 551
and you’re going to get to hear kassia as well, but we stand for the proposition tonight that, in fact, clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery. %$* 551
energy itself, if you think about the revenues generated globally, the largest industry in terms of revenue generation. %$* 551
so, if we get it right, it absolutely can be a significant part of our economic recovery. %$* 551
and it’s important for us to define the terms to some extent. %$* 551
when people hear “clean energy” in a lot of places in the world, they think it’s just wind or just solar. %$* 551
kassia and i tonight, we’re going to talk about clean energy in this broad spectrum. %$* 551
it is about renewable, about solar and wind and geothermal biomass, but it’s also about all those parts of the spectrum that involve the things that we’re doing to promote clean energy, and the research and development laboratories across this country, both public and private, how you commercialize that technology and get it into the marketplace, those things that involve transmission and smart grid technology that help us to manage loads on grid, those parts of the clean energy world that involve transportation-- %$* 551
think electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles, hybrid cars-- %$* 551
but again, the broad spectrum. %$* 551
when we think about clean energy, we do think about natural gas and believe that natural gas and nuclear and even clean coal can perhaps play a role in building out a clean energy economy in america and that it has to be every part of that, from stem to stern, in terms of our thinking about it. %$* 551
it’s important for us to understand as well that workforce development has to be part of our policy considerations. %$* 551
so one of the reasons i’m here tonight and one of the reasons i was fortunate to be invited is because, as the colorado governor, i said in colorado, “we’re going to build a new energy economy.” and i said this when i was campaigning, and over a four-year period, i signed 57 different bills into law, bills that we believe made a tremendous difference as it related to our energy portfolio going forward, but particularly relevant to tonight’s topic, made a significant difference in our ability to see economic development attached to clean energy. %$* 551
one of those bills was a renewable energy standard bill in the first 100 days that took us to a 20 percent standard by 2020 with a rate cap in place for consumers. %$* 551
in fact, last year, the utility and i, after talking with each other, said, you know what? %$* 551
we can get to 30 percent by 2020 with the same rate cap in place. %$* 551
so, as a state, we’ve got a 30 percent renewable energy standard. %$* 551
but in those 57 bills, we did smart metering, meaning people who were residential and industrial consumers could actually get paid if they put energy back onto the grid. %$* 551
we did a variety of things to inspire the bill out of transmission, inspire new technology, energy efficiency. %$* 551
when we talk about clean energy, energy efficiency is one of the most significant things we as a country can do to move this country in a direction toward, in fact, a clean energy economy. %$* 551
so i’m not going to go through the 57 bills, but what i’ll tell you is the proof is in the pudding. %$* 551
we have significant economic development tied to that, and i’ll give you just a couple of examples. %$* 551
vestas wind turbines, the danish company, building wind turbines in colorado, made the announcement just after i made the-- %$* 551
signed the bill. %$* 551
that allowed us to go to a 20 percent by 2020, they in fact then have four factories since that they’ve announced that, at the end of the day, it’s going to be 2,600 employees, a billion dollar investment. %$* 551
sma, it’s a german company-- %$* 551
they’re manufacturing solar inverters in colorado for the first time outside of germany. %$* 551
we have home-grown companies, companies, again, where the technology was developed in a laboratory in colorado we have, the national renewable energy laboratory or one of our research universities, or even private laboratories. %$* 551
one of the thin-film photovoltaic technologies was developed in a lockheed martin laboratory, and so we’ve commercialized that and see these companies grow from the ground up. %$* 551
we’ve seen all sorts of growth in this sector, even during a recession. %$* 551
and it’s not just colorado. %$* 551
if you look around the country, in places in the midwest, in the south, in the southeast, in california, in the northeast, here in new york, we’ve all sorts of investments in clean energy that is related to job growth. %$* 551
if you look at the last 10 years and if you look at michigan for example where they've had terrible job loss. %$* 551
in many of their conventional sectors, they’ve seen job increases, a 5.7 percent increase in jobs in michigan over the last decade. %$* 551
colorado had an 18 percent increase and as john said we’re the fourth if you look at where we stand, we are fourth in terms of how we have clean tech workers as a state. %$* 551
now in my last minute i’m just going to tell you there’s a reason for doing this that’s beyond just the economic development. %$* 551
we have a powerful example in colorado, powerful examples around the country that demonstrate economic development as a part of this. %$* 551
but there’re a couple of other things that are very important too. %$* 551
when you build out a clean energy economy, you actually do something in a very significant way to address the environmental challenges that are upon us. %$* 551
even if you don’t believe that global warming is human caused there are still significant environmental challenges. %$* 551
they are a part of a carbon based energy production sector. %$* 551
and in addition to that you wind up addressing another very serious problem we have in this country which is energy security. %$* 551
domestically produced energy does a variety of things including reducing our trade deficit and reducing it in such a way that we can look and say the health of the country is better going forward because we have proposed an agenda that relies upon domestically produced energy. %$* 551
it’s the trifecta, right? %$* 551
it is about energy security, it’s about environmental security, and it’s about economic security. %$* 551
thank you very much. %$* 551
thank you, bill ritter. %$* 13
our motion at this intelligence squared u. s. debate, "clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery." now to speak against that motion, steven hayward, a fellow at the american enterprise institute, a senior fellow at the pacific research institute for public policy, how wrote when al gore was given the nobel peace prize you wrote that it was a further degradation of a-- %$* 13
a further debasement of a once prestigious award for parson al-- %$* 13
are you saying our former vice president’s a little preachy? %$* 13
i think it’s fairly self evident, isn’t it? %$* 552
ladies and gentleman, steven hayward. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 552
our case against the motion tonight comes in two main parts, first that it represents a brazen case of bait and switch. %$* 552
i thought there’d be two of them, i’ve already heard of the third one, already tonight. %$* 552
and second that it rests on a basic but surprisingly widespread economic fallacy that paying more for energy will somehow make us richer. %$* 552
there are a number of collateral arguments in our case which my partner, robert bryce, will explore further, such as the fact that most forms of so-called clean energy are inferior energy sources, ill suited to many of our needs. %$* 552
now, the bait and switch comes in just two parts, i’ll have to leave the third for later. %$* 552
we’ve been told for the better part of the last two decades that we need to make a rapid transition to clean energy away from fossil fuels in order to stave off climate catastrophe. %$* 552
and all of the official assessments of the matter from the national and international bodies that have studied the matter such as the u.n.’s ipcc concluded that the cost of doing so would be substantial. %$* 552
and the pessimists said the costs that would hurt economic growth and lower gdp.the pessimists said it would hurt a lot, the optimists said the costs would be only modest, but the point is all of the assessments concluded that the sign before the economic cost would be negative. %$* 552
but with the collapse of meaningful climate legislation here and abroad, and the arrival of the great recession, suddenly the argument for clean energy has been shifted into the form of tonight’s motion. %$* 552
clean energy will make us richer, it is the path to prosperity itself. %$* 552
happy days are here again. %$* 552
it’s the new domain of free lunch economics, i call it three lumens. %$* 552
now, the basic problem with so-called clean energy is that nearly every form of it is more expensive than the fossil fuel energy it seeks to displace. %$* 552
now, i know of no economic theory that says the economy benefits by reducing the purchasing power of consumers. %$* 552
the case for this motion rests on the same fallacy as the retailer who loses money on each sale, but promises to make up for it with additional volume. %$* 552
the second bait and switch concerns what we mean by clean energy, because the working definition of clean energy seems to shift to make the term almost meaningless. %$* 552
typically clean energy has meant purely renewable sources such as wind, solar, tidal energy and geothermal, along with environmentally neutral technologies like biomass and biofuels, though i could add that corn ethanol badly failed the test of environmental neutrality. %$* 552
and despite more than 30 years of strong emphasis on these sources they still account for less than five percent of our energy supply. %$* 552
but now suddenly we’re told that natural gas is a clean energy source that should be used to displace coal. %$* 552
but there’s something very odd if we’re now counting a fossil fuel, a finite hydrocarbon, as a clean energy source. %$* 552
do carbon dioxide emissions no longer matter in the definition of clean energy? %$* 552
consider that climate policy orthodoxy says we need to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to one billion tons by the year 2050. today right now, carbon dioxide emissions from current use of natural gas 1.2 billion times. %$* 552
above the target for every source for the year 2050.this is why the sierra club, two weeks ago, changed its position and said we should now make it an object of national policy to phase out natural gas entirely by the year 2050.their director of climate and energy told the politico two weeks ago, quote, “we want people to know that natural gas is not a clean fuel.” mark brownstein, environmental defense fund, told politico, quote “simply because coal is awful doesn't mean natural gas gets to be terrible.” how is it that natural gas, which, as i say, produces over a billion tons of co2, is clean energy, but nuclear power, which produces zero co2 emissions, is usually considered not to be clean energy. %$* 552
governor ritter includes it as clean energy. %$* 552
the u.s.congress specifically excluded it from climate and energy legislation the last two years. %$* 552
moreover, if natural gas is clean energy, then guess what, so is oil. %$* 552
an awful lot of natural gas is produced in the production of oil, and oil has almost the same green house gas emissions per unit of energy produced as natural gas. %$* 552
and if you want to spend enough money, you can make coal clean. %$* 552
governor ritter used the same phrase president obama likes to use: “clean coal.” and so you're left with the rest of the clean energy suite that cannot scale up without mandates and massive subsidies from taxpayers. %$* 552
and even then, they still fail. %$* 552
in recent months, you've seen solar power-makers like solyndra in california, and evergreen solar in massachusetts, lay off a thousand employees, and cut about half their production capacity, despite receiving nearly a billion dollars in loan guarantees and subsidies from government. %$* 552
and we've seen a number of bio-fuel companies fail despite mandates of lavish subsidies. %$* 552
now, the idea that clean energy will be the sector that leads us out of the recession is equally risible. %$* 552
there are a number of studies on this. %$* 552
i'll give you one quotation from a study from the stanford university, a very highly-regarded energy modeling forum that concluded, quote, “the advantages of increased jobs for renewable energy are vastly overstated at costs prevailing today.” they note that most energy investments produce between two and six jobs. %$* 552
that's true of conventional oil and coal, and natural gas, but also of renewable sources like windmills. %$* 552
well, of course, if you spend a million dollars on any sector of the economy, the department of commerce's models say you get about 9.7 new jobs. %$* 552
that's why the energy modeling forum concluded, quote, “electricity generation across all sources creates far fewer jobs than other activities in the economy. %$* 552
subsidies to either green or conventional sources will detract, rather than expand economy's job base, because they will shift investments from other sectors that will create warms climates. %$* 552
in other words, if you're looking for a sector to generate job growth, to lead us out of the recession, the energy sector, clean or otherwise, isn't it. %$* 552
now, i'll conclude with an observation on the essential absurdity of this motion. %$* 552
if this motion were true, we would not need to debate it at all. %$* 552
did we have to debate whether railroads, and automobiles, and the telegraph, and the telephone, would transform transportation and communication? %$* 552
did we have to debate whether the technology revolution and the internet would change our lives? %$* 552
and change american productivity? %$* 552
did we, a hundred years ago, have to debate the motion that new oil, coal, and gas supplies will power the next generation of american industry? %$* 552
of course not. %$* 552
and above all, did we ever need a mandate from the government, like a renewable portfolio standard, to get consumers to buy cars or desktop computers? %$* 552
the answer to that is fairly obvious. %$* 552
clean energy, however defined, does not resemble any of the past histories of recession- busting forces. %$* 552
and the odd thing is, most recession-busting forces, like the housing sector in previous recessions, are because of this pent-up demand. %$* 552
there actually isn't a pent-up demand for new energy at the moment. %$* 552
energy consumption in america has fallen sharply as a result of the recession. %$* 552
our energy consumption is down by the largest percentage amount since the end of world war ii. so building new energy supplies right now makes about as much sense as building new tracts of suburban housing. %$* 552
and by the way, none of the ideas i've heard tonight, with the partial exception of electrified cars such as hybrids, do anything to affect the one part of the energy picture that bothers us the most, and that's our dependence on foreign oil. %$* 552
most of what you're going to hear tonight is about the electricity sector. %$* 552
we can put a windmill on every single house in america, and put solar panels on every roof, and it will not reduce our oil imports at all. %$* 552
the motion, in my mind, fails badly. %$* 552
thank you, steven hayward. %$* 13
so here's where we are, we are halfway through the opening statement in this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: “clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” you've heard two opening statements, and now onto the third. %$* 13
kassia yanosek is founding principle of tana energy capitol, and co-founder of the u.s.partnership for renewable energy finance. %$* 13
we also want to thank her, we were originally going to have, dan reicher, who was going to be sitting in this seat. %$* 13
he is literally snowed in, after an avalanche hit a road in utah last night. %$* 13
kassia came extremely highly recommended and was also an enormously good sport to step in on several hours’ notice. %$* 13
so we want to thank you first of all for that. %$* 13
and, kassia, when i did my quick research on you, i went to youtube and i found a video of you standing in a business suit, holding a live frog, which was what? %$* 13
well, first of all, i love frogs. %$* 553
and i’m willing to hold one in a business suit. %$* 553
but it was a function i went to in the u.k. for the prince’s rain forest project, so it was-- %$* 553
it was a promotional. %$* 13
it was a promotional. %$* 553
and i’m assuming that no frogs were harmed in the filming of that promotion. %$* 13
no, it was a video effect. %$* 553
ladies and gentlemen, kassia yanosek. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 553
again, my name is kassia yanosek and i come to you tonight as an investor. %$* 553
i’ve been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade, and i used to invest in dirty energy. %$* 553
my background includes investing at bechtel enterprises, the private equity arm of bechtel which is a large engineering firm. %$* 553
i also worked at bp.so i started out my career investing in coal and gas. %$* 553
and, you know, as an investor, i look for the biggest growth markets. %$* 553
so that’s why i’m a clean energy investor right now. %$* 553
i don’t sit in an ivory tower or a think tank. %$* 553
instead, i often sit in airplane seats, travel around the country, roll up my sleeves, meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs, and i figure out where to create value in this economy, which is why we’re here tonight. %$* 553
and this is what we’re talking about tonight. %$* 553
you know, most recently, before starting my firm, i was a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm that’s deployed millions of capital in the sector of clean energy. %$* 553
i currently invest with new york investment houses around the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies, and that’s where i think the opportunities are in this market. %$* 553
so i’m going to give you the real story tonight about why clean energy will drive our economic recovery. %$* 553
the other thing i’d like to point out is that i actually don’t think we should be having this debate-- %$* 553
not will it or won’t it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive our economy. %$* 553
we need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where we write op-eds, stop resting on our laurels of the past, stop wimping out about how china is going to cream us. %$* 553
is that any way to win a match or a race? %$* 553
so my goal tonight is to convince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that we’ve done in the past, and that clean energy is the next growth market for the u.s. %$* 553
and here’s why clean energy can drive economic growth. %$* 553
i’m going to give you three reasons. %$* 553
first of all, innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment, and i’m going to provide some examples, from i.t. to the auto industry, and also why government has in the past, and it needs to continue to be, an integral part of this growth for the energy sector. %$* 553
number two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth. %$* 553
so, instead of complaining about china, let’s start competing so we can sell into china. %$* 553
and then, third, we do need to talk about our dependence on oil. %$* 553
oil does not help economic recovery. %$* 553
our dependence on oil doesn’t help economic recovery; it actually hinders economic recovery. %$* 553
so we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce our dependence on any one commodity, which smoothes out volatility and helps our economy grow. %$* 553
so, point number one: innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energy sector. %$* 553
you know, we can see this in our i.t.markets. %$* 553
we now lead the world in research, product, and deployment. %$* 553
and certainly, silicon valley has been a huge driving force of the u.s.economy. %$* 553
right now, i believe that about 16 percent of our total exports are related to advanced technologies. %$* 553
well, guess what? %$* 553
that wasn’t part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago, so clean energy has a great future ahead of it if we’re going to actually put our heads together and start innovating. %$* 553
and government was a big part of that. %$* 553
darpa which is an arm of the government was instrumental in the development of the internet. %$* 553
and secondly, the auto industry-- %$* 553
dinosaur industry. %$* 553
you know, we got our pants beat off by japan. %$* 553
but guess what? %$* 553
detroit is turning around. %$* 553
we’re starting to see ford and chevrolet start developing electric vehicles. %$* 553
there’s a lot of activity out there, and it’s winning accolades. %$* 553
so it really debunks this view that we can’t afford to have this job creation in the united states. %$* 553
and then, finally, without going too much into the weeds, i’ll point out some obvious statistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs. %$* 553
last year, $243 billion was invested in clean energy globally. %$* 553
this is essentially a 25 percent compound average growth rate that we’ve seen over the past five years. %$* 553
and this is really one of the biggest drivers that we’re seeing in the markets today. %$* 553
in the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the united states while total jobs grew by only 3.7 percent. %$* 553
so i have a little bit of different perspective and some different statistics than my opponents over there. %$* 553
and then, finally, i’ll point out that costs are coming down, count down the curve. %$* 553
electric batteries cost about $1,000 a kilowatt hour two years ago; today it’s about half that, and we’re on track for some very competitive technology that we’re going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years. %$* 553
so we’re starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve. %$* 553
point two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth. %$* 553
it’s important that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets. %$* 553
it’s an opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs. %$* 553
my opponent actually pointed out a very important point: there is not a whole lot of energy growth going on in the u.s.and in the next 10-20 years. %$* 553
ninety percent of the growth and energy consumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries. %$* 553
so we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that we’re going to see in these export markets. %$* 553
so, finally, we need to learn from the information technology industry. %$* 553
we need to develop the energy economy the way we did the i.t.and we’re starting to do that. %$* 553
clean tech really is where information technology was 30 years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago. %$* 553
so we’re at the beginning of a very long and prosperous future for this sector. %$* 553
and then, point three, we need a portfolio of energy choice. %$* 553
dependence on fossil fuels doesn’t help economic recovery. %$* 553
as i said, it actually hinders it. %$* 553
you know, we’re seeing $100 oil. %$* 553
we’ve seen this happen before, and price spikes really do not help the economy. %$* 553
rising energy prices act as a drag on gdp growth. %$* 553
a 10 percent oil shock is-- %$* 553
could actually lower gdp growth by .2 percent per year for the next two years, and that’s a recent statistic that goldman sachs just put out. %$* 553
we’re also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporate margins, impacts the consumers, so when we talk about the price of energy, i don’t necessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energy economy in keeping costs down for consumers. %$* 553
so, essentially, with that, i’m going to close with bringing you back to the focus of this debate, which is that clean energy can drive the future of our economy. %$* 553
and, frankly, if you’re not for the clean energy economy, then you’re not for economic recovery. %$* 553
thank you. %$* 553
thank you, kassia yanosek. %$* 13
our motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” and here to speak against the motion, robert bryce. %$* 13
he is the author of “power hungry: the myths of “green” energy and the real fuels of the future.” he’s a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and former managing editor of the energy tribune. %$* 13
and you write, robert, in one of your books, about your experience with solar panels, which you’ve installed on your house in boston and you conclude that, after all, you’re just not sure they’re worth it. %$* 13
why? %$* 13
that’s true. %$* 554
what happened up there on the roof? %$* 13
i have to get up there and clean them, for one. %$* 554
second, the economics-- %$* 554
well, the reason i did, i got a subsidy, a nice big fat subsidy. %$* 554
the city of boston paid two-thirds of the cost, so i got a $23,000 system for about $8,000.but the payback, assuming no cost of capital and assuming electric rates stay flat, is 20 years. %$* 554
the life of a panel is about 20 years, so i don’t know whether it’s a good investment or not. %$* 554
we’ll see. %$* 554
okay, ladies and gentlemen, robert bryce. %$* 13
so, please, by a show of hands, who here is in favor of dirty energy? %$* 554
one. %$* 554
okay, two maybe. %$* 554
okay, thank you. %$* 554
that’s what i expected. %$* 554
well, the fact is that clean energy sounds tremendously appealing. %$* 554
there is no question about it. %$* 554
and debunking clean energy is a dirty job, but steve and i are here to do just that. %$* 554
reality is that clean energy is not a specific thing; it is a marketing slogan. %$* 554
if you remember, the waxman-markey bill in 2009 was called the american clean energy and security act. %$* 554
to the specifics, governor ritter mentioned natural gas. %$* 554
i am as pro- natural gas as anyone. %$* 554
i’m also ardently pro-nuclear. %$* 554
n to n, natural gas to nuclear-- %$* 554
i believe these are the paths to the future for a number of reasons. %$* 554
but he also included in his statement that coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar are clean. %$* 554
the reality is if all of our energy sources are clean, then none of them are. %$* 554
regarding clean coal, i view that oxymoronic, akin to family vacation or jumbo shrimp. %$* 554
took a while, but i’m glad you finally got it. %$* 554
thank you. %$* 554
wind energy is often viewed as the political darling of the moment. %$* 554
this is the clean energy source of the future. %$* 554
well, if you saw wgbh just yesterday they had a story about falmouth, massachusetts, in which they talked about the objections and, in fact, the strenuous protest by local residents against a new wind turbine in that town. %$* 554
i can point you to localities all over the world. %$* 554
i have interviewed people in new zealand, australia, ontario, nova scotia, missouri, wisconsin, new york, some very heated debates here in new york state over the sighting of industrial wind turbines. %$* 554
what is the problem? %$* 554
infrasound, low level noise that is driving people out of their homes. %$* 554
the wind energy industry says, “oh, well, these people that are complaining just need psychological counseling." i kid you not. %$* 554
this is a serious problem that they cannot solve and they try to dismiss it out of hand, it cannot be resolved. %$* 554
my opponent said that natural gas or rather that fossil fuels can’t possibly lead to any kind of economic recovery, i completely disagree. %$* 554
natural gas today is selling for less than $4, why? %$* 554
because of a tremendous technological innovation in the upstream oil and gas business. %$* 554
it's selling for about $4 per million btus, that’s a reduction of about $3 per mmbtu compared to just three years ago. %$* 554
that reduction in price is one of the rare bright spots in the commodity markets in the u.s.it is now saving american consumers $65 billion per year or $180 million per day, and that’s a minimum number. %$* 554
the reality is clean energy is such a nebulous phrase it cannot possibly be supported because the phrase doesn’t mean anything, therefore, you must vote against. %$* 554
second point, green jobs do not exist or are so expensive as to be crippling to the economy. %$* 554
if you’d believe the corn ethanol scammers, one of the longest running robberies of taxpayers in this country’s history, they just put out a report last month that said they’re-- %$* 554
they support 70,000 jobs. %$* 554
well, if you believe the congressional budget office numbers, the total taxpayer cost of the corn ethanol scam is over $16 billion. %$* 554
that works out to $230,000 per job. %$* 554
what about the wind industry? %$* 554
we hear this continually from the american wind-- %$* 554
energy association, "oh, we’re creating all kinds of manufacturing jobs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." texas comptroller public accounts susan colmes just came out with a report in december, estimated that every wind job in texas, where i live, texas leads the country in new-- %$* 554
in wind generation capacity, 10,000 megawatts, each job associated with the wind industry costs $1.6 million to the taxpayers. %$* 554
third point, clean energy cannot possibly drive america’s economic recovery because it is simply too small in scale. %$* 554
i pride myself on doing my research, doing my numbers, here they are. %$* 554
every day coal provides about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent to the u.s.economy. %$* 554
natural gas provides about 12 million barrels of oil equivalent every day to the u.s.economy. %$* 554
we also use roughly 17 million barrels of oil. %$* 554
so roughly 39 million barrels of oil equivalent from those three hydrocarbons, that dirty, nasty energy that nobody likes but everybody uses. %$* 554
okay, so what about the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy sources that we’ve been discussing here? %$* 554
non-hydro sources because we can’t build any more dams here, geothermal, wind, biomass, and solar. %$* 554
in 2010, according to the eia they provided 166 million megawatt hours of electricity to the u.s.that works out to277,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. %$* 554
so how does that compare then? %$* 554
if we just look at the two dirty, nasty sources of energy, oil and coal, they provide 100 times as much energy to the u.s. economy as the political darlings of the moment, the clean energy darlings of the moment. %$* 554
and if we include natural gas, which i believe is clean incredibly pro-natural gas, the ratio is 140 times as much energy from the three hydrocarbons as we get from the clean energy sources. %$* 554
we could double, triple, quadruple, quintuple the amount of energy that we’re getting from the clean energy sources that we’re discussing here, it will be so small as to make no difference to the u.s. economy, and it certainly will not drive america’s economic recovery, therefore, you must vote against the motion. %$* 554
final point, clean energy cannot fuel america’s economic recovery because it is simply too expensive. %$* 554
latest data from the energy information administration estimate that over the next five years or so, gas fired electricity will cost about $63 per megawatt hour, onshore wind will cost about 50 percent more than that, offshore wind, four times as much as that, and solar thermal generated electricity, five times as much as that. %$* 554
in january, the los angeles times reported on the city of los angeles' goal of having 33 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2020.i quote from the times, that, “this push for renewables could result in electricity rate hikes of five to eight percent in each of the next five years.” what's happening now, the city of los angeles is quietly rolling back the renewable targets. %$* 554
in the governor's, governor ritter's home state, electricity rates have increased by 21 percent over the past six years, and the denver post just reported they are likely to increase by 20 percent over the next six. %$* 554
over the last six years, the increase has been twice the rate of inflation. %$* 554
the reality is that oil price spikes hurt the u.s.economy, there's no question about that. %$* 554
with the coming rate, electricity rate hikes that will come from these renewable portfolio standards in the electricity markets, will be even worse for the economic recovery. %$* 554
you must vote against the motion. %$* 554
thank you. %$* 554
thank you, robert bryce. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
now onto round two, where the debaters address each other directly, and answer questions from you in the audience, and from me, john donvan. %$* 13
we're here at the skirball center at new york university in new york. %$* 13
we have two teams of two on the stage. %$* 13
bill ritter and kassia yanosek are arguing for the motion “clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” they are arguing that clean energy is a growth field, it is a revolution, you don't sit out revolutions. %$* 13
their opponents, robert bryce and steven hayward, are arguing, as a resolution, it's very tiny, more of a fantasy. %$* 13
we're going to, now, take questions from you and from them, and have them mix it up directly. %$* 13
and i want to go to the side arguing against the motion, against the clean energy as a solution for america's economic recovery. %$* 13
your opponents have made the case that, that the clean energy field represents a field of innovation, that innovation leads to jobs, innovation leads to exports. %$* 13
they cite the computer industry in our lifetimes as an example of this. %$* 13
okay, so there's a certain logic to that, that i think you can see. %$* 13
sure. %$* 554
take it on, robert bryce. %$* 13
i'm glad to, this is an easy one. %$* 554
what is the most admired company in america today? %$* 554
while it might be google, i would argue it's apple. %$* 554
apple's market cap today is over $330 billion. %$* 554
what does apple do? %$* 554
it designs its products in the united states, and manufactures them in china. %$* 554
are we supposed to be opposed to that? %$* 554
are we supposed to say, “oh, no, apple, you have to, you have to manufacture those products here in the u.s., even though it would be much more expensive, and then you need to export them”? %$* 554
this makes no sense whatsoever. %$* 554
apple is an incredibly dynamic company, and incredibly successful company, one of the most admired companies in the world, and yet we're told, “oh, no, there's something wrong with that”? %$* 554
further, and another, just, quick point. %$* 554
we heard that $243 billion is invested globally in clean energy. %$* 554
i have no doubt that that's the, maybe, the correct number. %$* 554
i can tell you that, here in the united states, the upstream oil and gas industry spends that much alone drilling new oil and gas wells every year. %$* 554
you don't think that they're innovating? %$* 554
of course they're innovating. %$* 554
and what have we seen? %$* 554
incredible success in the shale gas revolution that is driving-- %$* 554
all right. %$* 13
down the costs of %$* 554
so let me go to your opponents, the two arguing for clean energy as a driver of the economy. %$* 13
you've heard, he's basically saying that, yeah, there's innovation, but there's not much bang for the buck. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
kassia yanosek. %$* 13
sure. %$* 553
well, i think that, you know, first of all, we're going to have to define what clean energy is. %$* 553
clean energy is not just wind and solar, which i agree makes up a very small portion, less than eight percent, of our global, of our u.s.power generation. %$* 553
we have to include cleaner sources, cleaner ways to develop and produce energy that's being produced from coal, and natural gas, and nuclear. %$* 553
so when we talk about clean energy and the opportunity for economic growth we're not just limiting ourselves to renewables here. %$* 553
we're actually bringing in the opportunity to bring down costs, improve efficiency. %$* 553
one thing we haven't even started talking about tonight is actually energy efficiency, and the opportunities there. %$* 553
so, first, i would say that, number one, this is not a small industry. %$* 553
this is a huge industry. %$* 553
and there's so much opportunity-- %$* 553
but the wind power part of it-- %$* 13
they're right, is a small part of it. %$* 13
it's miniscule-- %$* 13
wind and solar make up about five percent of our global power generation, in the, well, definitely in the united states, less in the-- %$* 553
and do you see that becoming significantly more in the near to mid-term future? %$* 13
it's certainly growing by leaps and bounds, but, and so, as an investor, i care about growth, and where the best opportunities for investment are. %$* 553
so certainly the growth is happening in the renewable sector, and much higher growth rates than traditional energy. %$* 553
okay. %$* 13
but i would say that, when we're talking about, how do you grow the clean economy, it's about growing opportunity, broadly-speaking. %$* 553
and there are new innovations we haven't even thought about, i mean, think about the electric vehicle market. %$* 553
we didn’t think about building that market 10 years ago, so there are step changes that we haven’t seen that we need to be innovating for now. %$* 553
steven hayward, electric vehicles? %$* 13
well, they’ve got an awful long way to go yet. %$* 552
their performance metrics are not very good. %$* 552
but that doesn’t mean they can’t improve. %$* 13
no, but you’re going to need to make some huge breakthroughs in battery technology and other things to make them work. %$* 552
it’s sort of going step by step, and i’m something of an optimist on that. %$* 552
but, look, let’s suppose we wave a magic wand and we invent the perfect electric vehicle tomorrow that can be sold at a competitive price to a gasoline engine. %$* 552
we have what, 100 million cars in this country? %$* 552
two hundred million. %$* 554
two hundred-- %$* 552
those people not only keep them 10 to 15 years, people aren’t going to rush out and buy 200 million cars in the next two years if we do that, so that means we need oil for quite a while to come, right? %$* 552
i just want-- %$* 552
i have to say one other thing though to respond to kassia directly about energy efficiency. %$* 552
and the cars are part of the story, but they’re a separate thing too. %$* 552
if this debate were scored by the very strict rules of the oxford union, kassia would be ruled out of order for not speaking to the motion. %$* 552
energy efficiency is about the consumption of energy and how much of it we consume. %$* 552
clean energy refers to the supply of energy. %$* 552
we’re talking about two different things here. %$* 552
simple thought experiment, seems to me, clears this up. %$* 552
if you have a factory that gets all of its electricity by coal-fired power and you insulate it and do all the things we want to do to weatherize it and you lower your electricity consumption 25 percent, does that make that energy from the coal fire power plant clean energy all of a sudden? %$* 552
this is like saying we have a motion saying you should eat more vegetables because it’s good for your nutrition and then arguing, but actually, you should just eat less food overall. %$* 552
let’s bring in bill ritter. %$* 13
well, i think that’s-- %$* 551
i disagree that kassia should be thrown out of this debate. %$* 551
i think that that would be a problem-- %$* 551
i said “ruled out of order.” %$* 552
that would be an awful thing for my team. %$* 551
but why are we talking about clean? %$* 551
i mean-- %$* 551
because it’s in the title of the resolution. %$* 552
no, we say new energy-- %$* 551
the energy sources aren’t new. %$* 551
the energy sources have all been there, but the transfer has been to talking about clean because we care about emissions. %$* 551
and that’s really what-- %$* 551
i mean, why do we do this at all? %$* 551
because we care about what we emit. %$* 551
and if you don’t buy into human change or human-caused climate change, there are still serious environmental hazards that happen from burning hydrocarbons, right, so we care about clean. %$* 551
and think about an industry that’s focused on people using less energy, and actually, by using less energy, bringing down the cost of energy, that would be the cleanest form of energy because you’re not emitting at all. %$* 551
so, we’ve done a variety of things as a state that looks at how we go into homes where people have fixed incomes, low incomes, but they don’t have very efficient homes and we try and do what we can to modernize those homes and bring down their energy costs. %$* 551
but, bill, in your opening, i had more the sense that your argument was that this innovative industry would require-- %$* 13
will create jobs with the establishment of the plants and the factories that build the turbines and that sort of thing. %$* 13
and you’re broadening it now to-- %$* 13
am i right? %$* 13
that was your point. %$* 13
well, no, i mentioned energy efficiency somewhere in my opening and probably didn’t give it enough play perhaps because i do think that it is this powerful part of our thinking about clean energy, that we can build an industry around it. %$* 551
and, quite frankly, a lot of that industry has to do with the construction industry. %$* 551
if you look at this goal that we would reduce our emissions by 80 percent by 2050, there are people-- %$* 551
scientists-- %$* 551
who believe that we could get there, 40 percent of the way there, just by retrofitting the built environment, and that’s about energy efficiency. %$* 551
but still, i think we haven’t answered steve’s fundamental point, which is the motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” i’m all for efficiency. %$* 554
who isn’t? %$* 554
every engineer in the world is for efficiency. %$* 554
we are getting dramatically more efficient. %$* 554
today, in america, we use about the same amount of oil as we did in 1973 even though we drive twice as many miles and have twice as many cars, but clean energy, the motion is about the production of energy. %$* 554
that’s the key point. %$* 554
but i think your opponents are arguing that clean and efficient may be the same thing. %$* 13
but i think that that is not what the motion says. %$* 554
that is not what the motion speaks to. %$* 554
the motion is about clean, and it’s how you define “clean.” %$* 553
okay, then tell us what clean is, because i’m still confused. %$* 554
i think the governor had a very strong point that clean is about-- %$* 553
it could be defined as reducing emissions. %$* 553
and so, by improving the efficiency of a coal fire power plant and natural gas turbines, that, in our definition, is clean. %$* 553
john, if i may. %$* 552
steven hayward. %$* 13
by that definition, all fossil fuels are clean. %$* 552
a few facts then about this. %$* 552
we have tripled the amount of coal burned in this country since 1970 and reduced sulfur dioxide emissions in that same period by 70 percent. %$* 552
and the epa expects that we will fall a further 50 percent from current levels just based on existing control technologies that are going to be retrofitted on plants. %$* 552
right now, changes in technology for burning oil mean that emissions from our car and truck fleet-- %$* 552
of conventional air pollutants are falling by about eight percent a year on net. %$* 552
the epa’s own projections, which they never seem to talk about much, project that emissions of conventional air pollutants from the car and truck fleet will fall about another 70 percent over the next 20 years. %$* 552
and i’ve been saying for a long time, “but our grandchildren are going to say, ‘smog? %$* 552
what was that all about? %$* 552
’” and actually, having grown up in l.a., believe me, that’s an impressive thing to say. %$* 552
i really can’t imagine that you’re saying that we should not-- %$* 551
that we should sustain this level of emissions from coal burning plants that we currently have. %$* 551
no, what i’m saying is that your definition of clean is incoherent. %$* 552
no, no, it’s not because you can look at the different kinds of things that we are undertaking to lessen emissions. %$* 551
and if you’d rather, the operating principle here is that we should look at emissions. %$* 551
you pick out sulfur dioxide. %$* 551
we’ve done a good job with sulfur dioxide, but if you put in place-- %$* 551
let’s take natural gas-- %$* 551
natural gas, you decreased sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxygen by 70 to 80 percent. %$* 551
you wipe out the mercury. %$* 551
so you’re not mentioning mercury. %$* 551
we have lakes in this country we don’t eat fish out of because of the mercury that is part of coal pollutant. %$* 551
mercury emissions, by the way, have fallen 60 percent in the last 15 years, by the way. %$* 552
robert bryce. %$* 13
you can eliminate the mercury through natural gas services as well. %$* 551
robert bryce. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 554
can you say that one more time? %$* 554
we are using more natural gas. %$* 554
why are we using more natural gas? %$* 554
the coal industry is under obviously a lot of regulatory pressure for mercury. %$* 554
i think it’s appropriate. %$* 554
but they’re also under regulatory pressure for coal ash. %$* 554
that’s certainly appropriate. %$* 554
but last year, in 2010, according to the eia, the u.s.used more natural gas than it ever has, 24.1 trillion cubic feet, and yet still the price of gas has fallen. %$* 554
that is incredibly good news. %$* 554
your position is that natural gas is clean. %$* 554
i agree. %$* 554
your other position is that somehow that fossil fuels are not a benefit to the economy, which i think is completely untenable. %$* 554
let me move on to one other point. %$* 554

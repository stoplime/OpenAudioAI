good evening, everyone. %$* 13
hi. %$* 13
hello. %$* 13
my name is john donvan, and i will be moderating the debate which begins in about four minutes. %$* 13
i wanted to have a quick chat with you about a few things relating to primarily your role as members of the audience. %$* 13
normally, we do these debates in new york, and occasionally we go on the road, and it's really a pleasure for us to be here in chicago. %$* 13
so i'm going to give you the spiel i give you in new york, which is this: we want you as members of the audience not to consider yourself passive listeners. %$* 13
we need you to be the opposite of that. %$* 13
you actually act as the judges in the debate. %$* 13
you choose the winner of the debate. %$* 13
and the way we have you do that, if you see at your seats, there's a keypad. %$* 13
and at the very beginning of the debate, i'm going to state the motion, "ration end-of-life care," and, before the debate, you agree with this motion, we want you to register that by pushing number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, we want you to push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys at that point. %$* 13
they are not live. %$* 13
and if you push a key incorrectly, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
at the end of the debate, after you've heard the arguments, and we're asking you to keep an open mind through the course of the evening. %$* 13
after you've really listened to the arguments and listened closely, we're going to ask you to vote again. %$* 13
and we want to see whose minds have been changed or who came out of undecided to take one of the positions. %$* 13
and the team at the end of the evening whose percentage has changed the most according to your vote is going to be declared our winner. %$* 13
the second way in which your role is critical as members of the audience is that after a round, a formal round of opening statements by each debater in turn, we will then have a session where it's more mixed up. %$* 13
they can address each other and take questions from me. %$* 13
at that point, i also want to take questions from you. %$* 13
and the way that will work is if you just raise your hand, and i find you, just stand up. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you, and we want you to hold the microphone about this far away from your mouth. %$* 13
i'll explain why in a second. %$* 13
basically so that we can hear you. %$* 13
we'd like you to state your name and then ask a question. %$* 13
now, on the question, this does get tricky in new york at least. %$* 13
we don't want you to debate with the debaters. %$* 13
we-- %$* 13
that's what they're here to do. %$* 13
we want you really to ask a question that will move forward the discussion of this motion. %$* 13
what they're really here to debate and persuade you on is this short statement: "ration end-of-life care." so i'd like you to think in terms of asking a question that focuses on that, not a secondary issue. %$* 13
and i'll be fine if you want to make a short, very, very short opening statement of your premise. %$* 13
but then i want you to get to a question. %$* 13
and you'll know that it's a question because if a question mark goes at the end of the statement naturally, then it's going to work. %$* 13
and i will-- %$* 13
i will respectfully decline questions that are really off topic. %$* 13
and i may have to step in and help you phrase your question if you're struggling, but i do follow that very respectfully. %$* 13
we are being broadcast ultimately on npr stations, on npr-- %$* 13
on podcast downloads, on television in new york, not live, but we are live streaming right now as we speak. %$* 13
but because of that, a few things you need to know. %$* 13
there are certain formalities that we need to observe for the broadcast. %$* 13
i'm going to have to tell you many, many times that we're in chicago and many times that i'm john donvan. %$* 13
all things like that come back from the break. %$* 13
so just so you know that i haven't lost my bearings, that there's a purpose for that. %$* 13
also, a number of times through the evening, given that this is the home of the great program, "wait, wait, don't tell me," whose sound is-- %$* 13
whose live studio sound is just spectacular, we want to hear from you in the evening; feel pleased, to laugh, to laugh, to applaud, to express your dissatisfaction as long as it's not in an ugly way. %$* 13
you know, a well-placed guffaw is fine. %$* 13
we would-- %$* 13
we don't want you shouting out or anything. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
but again, really give thought to things. %$* 13
and at certain times during the broadcast, during those times, probably just before i introduce myself yet again, i'm going to raise my hand, and that's an obvious signal for, "can you please give a round of applause? %$* 13
" so i know that we don't even have to practice that. %$* 13
but in the beginning, i'm going to be introducing each of the debaters. %$* 13
it will be great if you could applaud each of them. %$* 13
my hand will be going up for that. %$* 13
the last thing, because we're doing a radio broadcast, is we have a lot of microphones placed all over the room. %$* 13
and cell phones and blackberries, et cetera, will cause interference with them if it reaches a certain critical mass. %$* 13
so we're-- %$* 13
we're fine if you're tweeting about this. %$* 13
in fact, we're delighted by that. %$* 13
if you're live tweeting, fine, because we don't think there will be enough people doing that to cause problems. %$* 13
but if you're not using your phone for that purpose, please shut down entirely. %$* 13
and you don't want it ringing in the middle of the debate and then having that be heard on npr stations across the station as you stifle your phone. %$* 13
so that's it. %$* 13
we're really, really delighted to be here and delighted that we have a full house upstairs and down. %$* 13
and folks upstairs, i need to tell you that our microphones for questions won't go up there. %$* 13
but if you make a special trip to come downstairs, and i notice, i'll try very hard to call on you to come into the debate. %$* 13
so we are put together-- %$* 13
we exist because of an organization called the rosenkranz foundation which started intelligence squared u.s.with the mission of raising the level of public discourse. %$* 13
and to help us now frame what this debate is, i would like to invite to the stage, to the seats out front, the chairman of the board of intelligence squared u.s., robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
so bob is just going to talk to us very briefly about what's going to happen here, why we're doing this. %$* 13
so what's at stake basically, bob, in this debate? %$* 13
well, this is one of the most intense emotional kinds of issues that we've ever debated. %$* 1
it raises all kinds of questions about ethics, but it also raises huge public policy questions. %$* 1
in our country, we're spending about 17 percent of gnp on healthcare. %$* 1
other rich countries spend about 9 percent. %$* 1
and a big driver of that is what's spent in the last year of life. %$* 1
and so like 30 percent of all medicare expenditures are in the final year of life. %$* 1
and this is frankly driving the huge government deficits that all of us are worried about, and it also, when it gets down to the level of the individual family, it's kind of why families in america have seen no increase in their real incomes over the last decade. %$* 1
all of the improvement in productivity and growth over that time has gone to healthcare. %$* 1
so the side that's arguing for rationing has what going for it as its strongest argument? %$* 13
well, i think the strongest argument simply is that we cannot afford to provide unlimited healthcare, particularly at the end of life, as if it were a free good. %$* 1
there has to be a way to bring in under control. %$* 1
and either governments or insurance companies have to ration end-of-life care as a policy response. %$* 1
and the opposite way, the side arguing against rationing. %$* 13
the side arguing against would say that healthcare, particularly at the end of life, should be the subject of a discussion between your doctor and your patient and the patient's family. %$* 1
and the argument against is really summed up in very colorful language. %$* 1
no one wants death panels. %$* 1
and why this debate now? %$* 13
well, i think the answer is the presidential debate. %$* 1
this is one of the critical national issues. %$* 1
and i expect, because it's such an emotionally difficult issue, it is not going to be debated forthrightly in the presidential debates. %$* 1
so i thought this was a good opportunity to do it. %$* 1
so we'll do it here. %$* 13
thank you, bob. %$* 13
and so that is the shape of this debate. %$* 13
and let's bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
and i would just like to ask for one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making all of this possible. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: end-of-life care, we can't afford to keep every elderly person alive, so we're going to have to ration it. %$* 13
is that right, or is that wrong? %$* 13
well, since probably all of us at some point want to have our crack at it, when it's our turn, but probably all of us in the meantime, we're going to have to pay for it for everybody else, and since there really are two serious sides to this argument, then let's make a debate of it. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we are in chicago, chicago ideas week. %$* 13
it is a pleasure to be here. %$* 13
the motion that's on the table, "ration end-of-life care." we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this motion. %$* 13
our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion, "ration end-of-life care," arthur kellermann, the paul o'neill alcoa chair in policy analysis at the rand corporation. %$* 13
his partner, peter singer, professor bioethics in the university center for human values at princeton university. %$* 13
the motion, "ration end-of-life care," and here to argue against the motion, ken connor, chairman and founder of the center for a just society. %$* 13
and his partner, sally pipes, president and chief executive officer of the pacific research institute. %$* 13
let's start off with "ration end-of-life care," and let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
first, dr. %$* 13
arthur kellermann. %$* 13
doctor, you worked in and you taught emergency medicine for about a quarter of a century. %$* 13
that's the front line in this really, and i want to ask you, do you think the rest of us, we, civilians, in this world, really have any idea how often these end-of-life decisions come up in the er? %$* 13
john, we save a lot more lives than we lose, but we deal with the issues we're going to debate tonight far more often than anyone realizes. %$* 466
okay, and your partner, peter singer. %$* 13
peter is a professor of bioethics at princeton, and you wrote in the new york times a few years back that a system of rationing care should include measures of the quality of life but not judgments about moral character or social value. %$* 13
why not? %$* 13
well, i think that's not the business of physicians. %$* 467
i think they can judge. %$* 467
there are ways of judging quality of life and life expectancy, but moral character is something different. %$* 467
it's too subjective, i think. %$* 467
i wouldn't like to see it used as a criteria in there. %$* 467
all right, peter singer. %$* 13
our motion is this, "ration end-of-life care," and here to argue against the motion, first, ken connor. %$* 13
ken, you are chairman of the center for a just society, and you played a major role in perhaps the most well known case that centered on end-of-life issues, the terri schiavo case, in which the nation and the family was divided over the question of whether to remove the feeding tube from a young woman. %$* 13
the governor of florida was empowered by the law called "terri's law" to become involved in that. %$* 13
what was your involvement in that story? %$* 13
i represented the governor in defending terri's law. %$* 468
and the fact that in the end your side lost? %$* 13
terri's law, was struck down by the florida supreme court, and terry was ordered to die by starvation and dehydration. %$* 468
she did so over a 13-day period. %$* 468
if the court had ordered that of ted bundy, it would have been deemed to be cruel and unusual punishment, but that's precisely what it was. %$* 468
and your partner, sally pipes, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
are also arguing against rationing end-of-life care, and you wrote a book called "the top 10 myths of american health care." so what do you think is the number one myth about end-of-life care? %$* 13
well, i think that one should not have to die earlier than one might in order to benefit society and reduce costs. %$* 469
people should have the right to die and to live as long as they can. %$* 469
all right. %$* 13
so we have already heard a taste of where this debate is going to go by listening, hearing all of our debaters in these brief introductions. %$* 13
now, in this debate, you, our live audience here in chicago, act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once again after the debate, on where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
and the team who has moved the most of you to their side by the end of the evening, and it's as a percentage term, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's have our preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the keypads on your seat, you'll see a series of numbers, but you only need to pay attention to one, two, and three. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to push number one if you agree with the motion, "ration end- of-life care," that's the side that this side is arguing for. %$* 13
if you agree at this point with this side, if you are against the motion, if you disagree with the motion, "ration end-of- life care," push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided at this point, push number three. %$* 13
my guess is that the undecideds are who these debaters are really fighting for, but not necessarily. %$* 13
we have had a lot of debates where people said that they listened so closely that their minds are actually changed because the arguments were so good. %$* 13
so we're going to lock that out now. %$* 13
and again, at the end of the debate, we'll have you vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed most as a percentage will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so our motion is, "ration end-of-life care." and on to round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and speaking first, for the motion, arthur kellermann, the paul o'neill co-chair and policy analyst at the rand corporation. %$* 13
prior to this, he was a professor of emergency medicine. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, arthur kellermann. %$* 13
as you hear from each of us tonight, i urge you to not only listen to our arguments, but consider our different backgrounds and our different interests. %$* 466
since 2010, i've worked for the rand corporation. %$* 466
rand is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy questions confronting our country and the world. %$* 466
rand analysts are expected to be dispassionate and detached. %$* 466
that's not a good way to win an "intelligence squared" debate. %$* 466
so this morning i advised rand i was taking a day of annual leave. %$* 466
and i'm here tonight not as a rand analyst but as an er doctor. %$* 466
who, as john said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying patients in some of our nation's busiest ers. %$* 466
the goal of emergency medicine is always to save lives. %$* 466
but you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants. %$* 466
it happens when a critically ill patient is rushed to the er in the very last stages of a terminal illness. %$* 466
and that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got around to having the conversation. %$* 466
they never got around to talking with the patient about, "what will they want us to do when they reach that point? %$* 466
" so we end up having that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a family conference room or at the bedside. %$* 466
now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full- court press. %$* 466
start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, put in iv lines. %$* 466
but, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want. %$* 466
and rather than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying. %$* 466
that's why when "intelligence squared" called me and asked if i would do this debate tonight, my answer was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what their family goes through too. %$* 466
now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, i think it's important for us to define just what we mean. %$* 466
what kind of end-of-life care are we talking about? %$* 466
medical and surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be used. %$* 466
limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine. %$* 466
many treatments are used to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, or there was no advanced care planning. %$* 466
avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's simply rectifying poor-quality care. %$* 466
and some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low chance of success. %$* 466
declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would consider rationing. %$* 466
and my teammate, professor singer, will have more to say about that in a minute. %$* 466
but i do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used often enough. %$* 466
it's relatively inexpensive. %$* 466
it's highly valued by patients. %$* 466
and it's effective. %$* 466
it's palliative care. %$* 466
palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they can be as they approach the last days of their lives. %$* 466
now, two years ago, a group of cancer specialists published an amazing study in the "new england journal of medicine." they took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer. %$* 466
and they randomly assigned them to two treatment groups. %$* 466
one treatment group got palliative care and standard cancer treatment. %$* 466
the other group got very aggressive, advanced cancer care. %$* 466
and they followed the two groups. %$* 466
the palliative care group not only had a better quality of life and less depression prior to their death. %$* 466
they lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment. %$* 466
this past august another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life. %$* 466
those that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried. %$* 466
those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth. %$* 466
so at the outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad medicine. %$* 466
and you can be confident that professor singer and i did not come here to advocate limiting access to palliative care. %$* 466
so that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of situations in a highly charged question: do patients in the last stages of terminal illness have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long as they want? %$* 466
because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price. %$* 466
despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 percent. %$* 466
so the question is not whether we're going to live or die. %$* 466
the question is where and how we'll die and who will be with us when we do. %$* 466
most of us don't want to die in an intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved ones. %$* 466
yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life. %$* 466
as a physician, my goals are simple: to save as many lives as i can, to ease pain and suffering when i cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect. %$* 466
that's why at the end of this evening i urge you to vote for the proposition. %$* 466
thank you. %$* 466
now, arguing against the motion, sally pipes. %$* 13
she is president and chief executive officer of the pacific research institute. %$* 13
she also writes a weekly health column for forbes.com and is the author of "the pipes plan: the top ten ways to dismantle and replace obama care." ladies and gentlemen, sally pipes. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 469
and i am against the proposition that we should ration end-of-life care. %$* 469
my mother was canadian and a senior. %$* 469
in july of '05, she felt she had colon cancer. %$* 469
her primary care doctor said she did not because he did an x-ray and no cancer showed up. %$* 469
well, we all know that colon cancer is not detected by an x-ray but by a colonoscopy. %$* 469
but she could not get one in canada because of her age and the fact that a waiting list for people under 65 with colon cancer symptoms was over six months. %$* 469
so by late november, my mother was hemorrhaging and had lost 35 pounds. %$* 469
she knew she was ill, and she went to the hospital in an ambulance and went to the emergency room, spent two days in the transit lounge. %$* 469
then she did get her colonoscopy. %$* 469
but sadly, she passed away two weeks later from metastasized colon cancer. %$* 469
this is the outcome when government bureaucrats set the rules for who is going to get care and when. %$* 469
this is rationed care and what will face seniors in america if the affordable care act is not repealed and replaced. %$* 469
rationing care at the end of life may be a sound solution in the abstract. %$* 469
but when it comes to your mother, your father or your child who has a terminal illness, it is wrong for social engineers and government bureaucrats to make these life decisions for you. %$* 469
in canada where i grew up, the government spends 11.4 percent of gross domestic product on healthcare. %$* 469
and private health insurance is outlawed. %$* 469
the government sets a global budget, the one that government can afford. %$* 469
the demand for healthcare is much greater than the supply. %$* 469
as a result, canadians spend-- %$* 469
and they have long waiting lists, rationed care and lack of access to the latest treatments. %$* 469
17 percent of canadians are waiting to get a primary care doctor. %$* 469
in 2011, 940,000 canadians were on a waiting list waiting for treatment. %$* 469
the average wait in 2011 from seeing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 19 weeks, up from 18.2 weeks the year before. %$* 469
in the case of my own mother, it may have shortened her life, but it was definitely cheaper for the government. %$* 469
in the case of my mother, it may have shortened her life. %$* 469
but colon cancer is one of the most common diseases among our seniors. %$* 469
a study published in the british journal lancet oncology, suggests that america is one of the best countries for treating cancer and survival rates five years after diagnosis for 13 of the 16 most common cancers. %$* 469
do we want to change this outcome by controlling healthcare costs through rationed care? %$* 469
for example breast cancer survival rates among american women is 83.5 percent, whereas in britain, it's only 70 percent. %$* 469
prostate cancer, survival rate 92 percent in the u.s., only 51 percent in britain. %$* 469
so how will the affordable care act ration care for our seniors and in particular those in need of healthcare? %$* 469
in three ways: the independent payment advisory board, accountable care organizations and the patient-centered outcome research institute. %$* 469
first, ipab; on october 1, president obama and governor romney spent a lot of time debating the issue of ipab.ipab will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by the president and approved by the senate whose job it is to cut medicare spending. %$* 469
it will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on medicare exceeds the average consumer price index growth rate between 2014 and 2018. after that, costs will be tied to gdp growth plus 1 percent. %$* 469
the board must propose spending cuts. %$* 469
congress could overrule the board, but only if it has a 3/5 majority in the senate and the house or comes up with another plan to reduce costs. %$* 469
the accountable care organization is second. %$* 469
they are delivery models for doctors and hospitals to give them financial incentives to provide good quality coordinated care to medicare beneficiaries while keeping costs down. %$* 469
they would benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for treating medicare patients. %$* 469
if higher, acos would have to pay back funds to the government. %$* 469
it is my belief that doctors and hospitals will ration or deny care to seniors if they feel that their costs would exceed the ceiling. %$* 469
acos are a giant hmo. %$* 469
third is the patient-centered outcomes research institute (pcori). it is similar to nice in the uk, a government agency that determines which treatments are cost effective as compared to medically effective. %$* 469
while no one can deny that there are problems in american healthcare, a system that empowers doctors and patients will solve them, not the federal government. %$* 469
i do think that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care. %$* 469
how do we achieve that goal? %$* 469
well, i believe there are two competing visions when it comes to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage. %$* 469
one focuses on doctors and patient-centered solutions. %$* 469
the other focuses on increasing the role of government in our healthcare system. %$* 469
that was president obama's vision. %$* 469
liberal politicians, academics and the elite media tell americans that socialized assistance such as exists in canada and europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all. %$* 469
and while it is true that 5 percent or 2.5 million seniors in their last year of life consume 25 percent of medicare spending, it is still my belief it is not the government's place to limit costs by sacrificing lives. %$* 469
end-of-life decisions should be made by doctors and families, not bureaucrats such as those on ipab and pcori.they will ration the care our seniors receive, and i believe that is ethically and morally wrong. %$* 469
in my view, people have every right to live as long as they can. %$* 469
therefore, i urge you to vote against the proposition. %$* 469
thank you. %$* 469
thank you, sally pipes. %$* 13
and we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "ration end-of-life care." you have heard the first two opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
debating for the motion, "ration end-of-life care," the ira w. decamp professor of bioethics at princeton university, he's been called the most influential living philosopher by the new yorker and is the author of a number of books including "the life you can save" and "animal liberation." ladies and gentlemen, peter singer. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 467
it's the position of our side that we are already rationing health care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so. %$* 467
the question that we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we're doing, and, therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially means, "do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we're spending now," or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don't bring out in the open so we cover up, that we don't really dare to discuss. %$* 467
and we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the money we're spending effectively. %$* 467
now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at present. %$* 467
we spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross national product, on health care. %$* 467
that's about 50 percent more than other comparable countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with. %$* 467
there is no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of gdp that we're spending, than those other countries. %$* 467
and dr. %$* 467
kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what sally pipes just said when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks. %$* 467
when we looked at not just what the health system does – but at health outcomes in america, we're actually terrible. %$* 467
it's the combination of what the health system does and our general health. %$* 467
we rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like slovenia and costa rica. %$* 467
they are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet their health outcomes are comparable to ours. %$* 467
and the other industrialized nations have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, canada. %$* 467
it's also true-- %$* 467
it's also true that when you ask canadians, as gallop did a couple of years ago, and americans, and britons, people in the u.k., do they have confidence in their health care system, the britons and the canadians, 73 percent of them, just coincidentally the same number, say, "yes," they do. %$* 467
when you asked americans, only 56 percent of them say they do. %$* 467
i think that there's a general feeling that this health care system is not delivering what we want. %$* 467
but as i said it is rationing. %$* 467
it rations in many ways. %$* 467
for example, we about 44 million people, americans, now, who are not insured at all. %$* 467
that number will drop significantly when obama care comes into effect, but it will not unfortunately drop to zero. %$* 467
now, not being insured means that you are more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident. %$* 467
in fact, joseph doyle, a mit scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road accidents, seriously injured. %$* 467
and found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for other variables than those who had insurance. %$* 467
and when he calculated how much it would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000.reasonable amount of money. %$* 467
but that was how much more was spent on saving the lives of the others. %$* 467
but given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about $5,500.these people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each year of life that we could have saved. %$* 467
compare that with the amount that those much criticized bodies sally pipes mentioned nice, the national institute for clinical excellence in the united kingdom. %$* 467
what they say is too much to spend. %$* 467
apparently, nice’s figure is around $49,000.in other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these young accident victims. %$* 467
and of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because some people can't afford copayments. %$* 467
we have long waiting times. %$* 467
we don't pay doctors enough for medicare, and so they don't take medicare patients, or they don't take so many medicare patients. %$* 467
so we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we could save quite cheaply. %$* 467
so i think we ought to be more explicit about this. %$* 467
we ought to be prepared to say, "let's use the dollars-- %$* 467
" maybe we should spend more dollars. %$* 467
i'm not necessarily opposed to spending more dollars. %$* 467
but let's use the dollars we spend in the most effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives. %$* 467
something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than the economy is growing. %$* 467
they're rising at 9.8 percent per annum. %$* 467
we all know the economy is not growing at anything like that amount. %$* 467
so as that keeps happening, what's going to happen? %$* 467
it will eventually soak up all available spending. %$* 467
but we know the government has to spend on other things. %$* 467
on the website, in the articles that were posted. %$* 467
there's a very moving piece by ken connor about the plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the demographic changes, there's going to be more of them. %$* 467
effectively, we need to spend a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no longer look after themselves. %$* 467
that costs money, and it's going to cost more money. %$* 467
we cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important things that we need. %$* 467
so, like it nor not, we are rationing health care. %$* 467
we are arguing that, indeed, we should. %$* 467
that's obvious. %$* 467
but whether we should be more explicit about it, because we want to get the best results we can. %$* 467
we want to save the most number of lives that we can. %$* 467
and the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this motion. %$* 467
we should be rationing health care. %$* 467
thank you. %$* 467
thank you, pete singer. %$* 13
and our final debater will be speaking against this motion. %$* 13
it's ken connor. %$* 13
ken is chairman and founder of the center for a just society. %$* 13
he is a successful trial lawyer. %$* 13
he represented governor jeb bush in the long-running terri shiavo case, and for several years served as president of the family research council. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ken connor. %$* 13
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 468
sally pipes' mother's situation is exhibit "a" for why americans don't want the government to wind up rationing health care in this country. %$* 468
by contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an older age than sally's mom. %$* 468
she received aggressive treatment, both surgery and chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed. %$* 468
which system would you prefer? %$* 468
ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to make three points, if i may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care. %$* 468
first of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by bureaucrats at a remote location. %$* 468
secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying. %$* 468
thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way-- %$* 468
lazy man's attempt to balance the budget. %$* 468
it's easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands of the special interests at home and abroad. %$* 468
so back to the premises, first of all, that healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside. %$* 468
americans don't want bureaucratic bean counters in washington making decisions about what kind of care they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life. %$* 468
decisions about healthcare and how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families. %$* 468
decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given patient should take into account the needs of the patient. %$* 468
in other words, healthcare should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient. %$* 468
a bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of individualized decisions that are required. %$* 468
these are decisions that have to be based real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. %$* 468
in the morning as dr. %$* 468
kellermann has pointed out. %$* 468
and it's the people who have their feet on their floor-- %$* 468
on the floor in the hospital and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions. %$* 468
there's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine in washington can make those kinds of decisions. %$* 468
healthcare requires the fine edge of a scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax. %$* 468
and patients don't want their doctors straight- jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city. %$* 468
they want decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account. %$* 468
they don't some interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in washington, in a room that was predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions. %$* 468
and, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in washington to be making these kinds of decisions? %$* 468
should cost be the primary driver of such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in washington? %$* 468
i would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort. %$* 468
now, no one is suggesting for a moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources. %$* 468
we absolutely should be. %$* 468
but rationing is not what we need. %$* 468
it's rational care. %$* 468
we ought to be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient? %$* 468
is it clinically appropriate? %$* 468
is the cost reasonable compared to similar services? %$* 468
these are questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the hospital in real time by hospitalization-- %$* 468
hospital utilization committees and not by people who are removed from the bedside. %$* 468
now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former colorado governor richard lamb who said, "the elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way." this philosophy sees the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now costs more to maintain than they produce. %$* 468
they reject the sanctity of life ethics that has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious and out to be respected and protected under the law. %$* 468
that view affirms equal protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old. %$* 468
instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies. %$* 468
of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability don't score well using those formulas. %$* 468
and isn't that the point? %$* 468
ladies and gentlemen, what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of life? %$* 468
will they be any more successful than they were in picking solindra and bright source and abound solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars? %$* 468
but then again, what does it matter? %$* 468
at the end of life, we're all going to die, right? %$* 468
folks, i would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying. %$* 468
for heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the wall street bailout to rescue businesses that engaged in profligate spending practices. %$* 468
surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick and the dying. %$* 468
ladies and gentlemen, i urge you to vote against the proposition because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did. %$* 468
thank you. %$* 468
thank you, ken connor. %$* 13
that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
now we'll have the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience, we have two teams of two. %$* 13
arthur kellermann and peter singer are arguing for the motion: "ration end-of-life care." and we have heard them say basically that we already are rationing, that healthcare is rationed right now by the ability to pay for it by the individual and that it is time to be explicit, to ration in a different way, to step up and admit that's what we're doing and figure out a system for doing it. %$* 13
they say that you need to figure out how much saving a life produces in terms of results. %$* 13
you have to compare that to how the resources could be used elsewhere. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, sally pipes and ken connor, argue that rationing end- of-life care is the wrong way to balance the budget. %$* 13
they say that it would be falling to government bureaucrats to make intensely personal decisions, that cost should not be the driver of a decision regarding the end of life, and that they depict a future where basically the elderly will be thrown overboard. %$* 13
now, i notice that the two sides do agree that cost cutting needs to happen, that costs are out of control. %$* 13
they do agree that ideally these decisions will be made at the bedside by doctors and their families. %$* 13
the question is, who ends up controlling where the money comes from. %$* 13
and i want to put to the side arguing in support of rationing end-of-life care, particularly to peter singer, this basic question: is there a way actually to arrive at a dollar value for what a few more months of life would be worth to an elderly person versus what it would be worth to a younger person? %$* 13
and does that explain whether-- %$* 13
does that price carry over to whether a procedure is worth pursuing or not? %$* 13
can you put a dollar number on these things? %$* 13
it's very difficult to agree on dollar numbers. %$* 467
i mean, healthcare economists try to do it because really what they're doing is they're comparing what you get for your money if you spend it on one thing, let's say saving young people's lives and what you get for your dollar if you spend it on something else, perhaps let's say for cancer where it can only extend life by two or three months at significant expense. %$* 467
and i think what they can clearly say is we get better value in some cases rather than others. %$* 467
we extend lives for longer for the same amount, or we extend lives for an equal amount for less money. %$* 467
you said in your opening remarks that younger lives are less expensive generally speaking to save than older lives with the outcome of a longer life lived because the person's younger rather than older. %$* 13
am i reading you correctly? %$* 13
well, i think most of us would agree that it's a greater tragedy if a 20-year-old dies because they're in an accident and didn't have health insurance than if an 85-year-old dies. %$* 467
i think, you know, we would feel that people have lived most of their life, achieved most of what they're going to achieve when they die in their 80s, let's say. %$* 467
it's still sad, of course. %$* 467
i know it's sad. %$* 467
but it's a greater tragedy. %$* 467
it's worth spending more to prevent if we can save the life of somebody who still has most of their life in front of them and still has a lot of things that they can achieve. %$* 467
all right. %$* 13
sally pipes i'd like your response to that in light of your saying in your opening remarks that each of us has the right to live as long as we can. %$* 13
does age come into it? %$* 13
do the young-- %$* 13
do the younger have more of a right to live as long as they can than the older? %$* 13
no. %$* 469
i believe we all have the right to live as long as we can. %$* 469
only when someone has died can we actually measure the cost of what the cost of keeping that person alive is. %$* 469
but i think that people should be able to get the best healthcare they can and not have their care rationed by government bureaucrats. %$* 469
but you know, we all want to live longer lives, have affordable, accessible quality care. %$* 469
how do we do that? %$* 469
well, we have to make some changes to our health care system. %$* 469
i believe in empowering doctors and patients, making changes to medicare and medicaid, changing the tax treatment because for people who have-- %$* 469
sally, can i interrupt? %$* 13
but you made that point in your opening statement. %$* 13
and i want to kind of keep on this question that the other side has raised about-- %$* 13
and you were beginning on it-- %$* 13
on this question of older versus younger, that they're-- %$* 13
what they're constructing is the notion that if you save the life of a person who then lives for 50 years, that, therefore, there's more value in that than saving the life of a person who lives for two years. %$* 13
you get 25 more years of life out of it. %$* 13
and it's a mathematical calculation. %$* 13
and i want to know how that sits with you, that-- %$* 13
to take math and dollars - - and dollar figures to apply to these very sensitive issues. %$* 13
well, i would say i don't think we should be using mathematics to determine this. %$* 469
we should give people the best opportunity to get the best care that they can, regardless of their age. %$* 469
i mean, if you take an issue like infant mortality, people assume and probably will say, "well, infant mortality is much higher in the u.s.than it is in countries in europe," but you have to compare apples with apples. %$* 469
you know, americans have-- %$* 469
we have the best neonatal care. %$* 469
when the children live-- %$* 469
survive a lot more in this country because they have this good neonatal care, in countries in europe, they determine that as a fetus or a newborn, if under a certain weight and a certain length, they're not counted as a live birth. %$* 469
so i think we don't want to put dollars and cents on this. %$* 469
we want to give everyone the best possible care. %$* 469
and how we get there is-- %$* 469
well, we can talk about it a little bit later. %$* 469
all right. %$* 13
and ken connor, your partner. %$* 13
john, i'd like to weigh in against that kind of a calculating. %$* 468
in america, we hold to the proposition that all men are created equal. %$* 468
equal protection under the law is the hallmark of american justice. %$* 468
and i would suggest to you that any point of view that says that a person's dignity diminishes with age or that somehow their personhood erodes as they get older is a point of view really that is a bankrupt point of view. %$* 468
and inevitably that point of view will endanger everyone who reaches old age or anyone who should suffer from the slings and arrows of misfortune and wind up suffering a serious illness or injury. %$* 468
but we haven't said their dignity is less or that their personhood is less. %$* 467
what we said is that they have less years to live. %$* 467
and that's a different question. %$* 467
well, let me ask you this point, if i may, you've been an apologist in your book-- %$* 468
in your books for infanticide, making the point that disabled infants who lack rationality or the capacity to grasp that they existed over time or that they lack some form of self consciousness were somehow not persons and could be disposed of, indeed you've gone so far as to make that argument about all newborn infants, maintaining that within a period of, say, 28 days after birth, parents should be able to decide to get rid of them or not. %$* 468
point of order. %$* 467
my question would be-- %$* 469
point of order. %$* 467
this is not the topic we're debating tonight, but i'm happy to debate it some other time. %$* 467
well, it is the topic. %$* 468
i want to give ken a chance to relate it. %$* 13
and here's the point i would make, old people who suffer from dementia often lack self awareness. %$* 468
they often lack the capacity for rationality. %$* 468
they often lack the capacity to grasp the notion that they exist over time. %$* 468
would you declare them non-persons and say that they are not worthy of protection and preservation, as you have in the case of-- %$* 468
okay, art kellermann, because i'm not hearing them make the argument in that extreme way, but i want to-- %$* 13
i just got to get a couple of things sorted out here. %$* 466
i'm easily confused. %$* 466
first of all, i want to make sure i came to the right debate tonight because i came here to debate whether-- %$* 466
how we approach end-of-life care. %$* 466
i did not-- %$* 466
i just want to make sure i'm at the right debate, because i'm not here to debate solyndra, wall street, obamacare, or the presidential election. %$* 466
i'm just confused, but i'm southern, and we're easily confused. %$* 466
so second question is are we here to debate an elderly person's right to super expensive care paid for by the government versus simply very expensive care that we all agree is probably a reasonable deal, or are we here to debate whether or not poor people and other folks can get decent care versus no care, because i personally believe in the sanctity of life, but i think the sanctity of life extends beyond birth and goes all the way up and doesn't sort of kick in again the last few weeks before death. %$* 466
it extends throughout life for the uninsured, the poor, and working class folks, too. %$* 466
and they should be part of this discussion. %$* 466
exactly my point. %$* 468
and the point is, we're going to use some kind of criteria to decide who lives and who dies. %$* 468
and for instance, if the eminent dr. %$* 468

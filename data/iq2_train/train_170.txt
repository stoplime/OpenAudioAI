singer were to become the rationer in chief in the next administration, what criteria would he use? %$* 468
would we look at the elderly, the demented, the disabled and say that their quality of life years don't merit preserving their lives? %$* 468
would we say that, as in the case of the infants that he's identified, that they are not persons whose lives are worthy of protection and preservation? %$* 468
ideas have consequences. %$* 468
what we believe determines how we behave, and this logic applies at the end of life no less so than at the beginning. %$* 468
let's take one specific part of your question that relates most closely to this motion, to peter. %$* 13
and, you know, if you were the rationer in chief-- %$* 13
that's not a very likely scenario. %$* 467
no, it's unlikely to happen for anyone. %$* 13
but do you have a system? %$* 13
or do you have the outlines of a system? %$* 13
do you have a philosophy about how this should be approached? %$* 13
i would try to look at the number of years that we can expect to extend people's lives for a given number of dollars. %$* 467
i would also try to look at the quality of life as well. %$* 467
now, that certainly may be affected by dementia, but, in addition, especially with older people, i would hope that they would be encouraged to state their own wishes as to what should happen to them if they become demented, or if other things happen to them. %$* 467
but, peter, assuming that you're correct, that you're not going to get the job, what body do you see making the decisions? %$* 13
so i think, actually, although it's much criticized, i think that the u.k. model of setting up-- %$* 467
they have a national institute for clinical excellence. %$* 467
sally referred to it by its acronym, nice.not everybody thinks it's nice. %$* 467
but what they do is, they try to cost the various treatments that are out there, and they try to get expert data on how long those treatments extend life in a variety of different conditions, and they make recommendations. %$* 467
they're not binding, but they make recommendations to the local area health authorities throughout the united kingdom to suggest that this treatment does give value for the money; you should be providing it. %$* 467
but perhaps this treatment for this specific condition is above the bar that we think reasonable, and you may consider not providing that. %$* 467
and the health authorities then reach those decisions. %$* 467
and how often-- %$* 13
if you happen to know-- %$* 13
how often is there a recommendation not to use a particular intervention or treatment? %$* 13
is it uncommon, or is it pretty common? %$* 13
it's relatively common that there are some treatments for some specific conditions that are considered too expensive to provide. %$* 467
and i think that that's going to be inevitable, because medical technology really has no limits to how much it can cost, and the drug companies can charge more. %$* 467
in fact, drugs are much cheaper in the united kingdom because the manufacturers know that if they price them very high, they're not going to be recommended by nice, whereas here they can basically charge whatever they like, and they're still going to get users. %$* 467
let's hear from your opponent sally pipes. %$* 13
so you are a proponent of nice, which i think the patient-centered outcomes research institute is patterned after, but if you read the british press about people-- %$* 469
the quality- adjusted value of life. %$* 469
if you're, say, 68 years old and the actuaries within the national health service bureaucracy say, "your life is worth $49,000." you may have been diagnosed with a severe cancer, macular degeneration, but if the drugs to take care of this are costing more than $49,000, you are denied care in the united kingdom. %$* 469
read the british press, the daily telegraph, the daily mail, any of it. %$* 469
people are complaining all the time, even ex-employees at the national health service will say, "it's wrong that we cannot get the care we need because it may be medically effective but it's not cost-effective." and on the issue of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, yes, drugs and medical devices are cheaper in canada and in the u.k.and other countries in europe. %$* 469
they don't develop these drugs and medical devices. %$* 469
the united states is the entrepreneurial capital for developing drugs and pharmaceuticals. %$* 469
pharmaceuticals cost about $1.3 billion from the idea until it gets through. %$* 469
these other countries-- %$* 469
canada, britain-- %$* 469
they free-ride off our r&d, and it is wrong. %$* 469
sally, one question for you when you were describing what the british are doing, saying no to certain procedures that are not considered cost-effective or not effective enough to justify the cost. %$* 13
don't insurance companies do that all the time? %$* 13
yes, insurance companies make decisions based on actuarial evidence. %$* 469
would you prefer the government to making decisions about what drugs and treatments you can't, or would you prefer the private sector and insurance companies to make those decisions? %$* 469
i, personally, want insurance companies-- %$* 469
i prefer insurance companies. %$* 469
well, you know-- %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
let's show some respect to this-- %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
why would you prefer the private sector to do it, to the government? %$* 13
because the private sector provides all things that we-- %$* 469
we can make decisions about what kind of cell phones we want, what kind of bank accounts we want. %$* 469
the private sector is always good. %$* 469
but the problem in this country is that 50 percent of our healthcare today is already in the hands of government through medicare, medicaid, chip and the va system. %$* 469
we don't have a private market. %$* 469
we need to move to a three- year market, get insurance away from employers. %$* 469
60 percent of americans have their healthcare through their employer. %$* 469
and if they don't like the plan or whatever, you're stuck with that. %$* 469
but if you lose your job, you lose your insurance, you go into the private market, you have to buy your insurance with after-tax dollars. %$* 469
i want to see the tax code changed so that we can move to a more individualized basis on health insurance just like our car insurance, our life insurance, our long-term care insurance. %$* 469
this is the way america works. %$* 469
it's what makes america great. %$* 469
and we don't want to move to a canadian style single-payer system which i think the president, nancy pelosi and harry reid, that is their ultimate goal. %$* 469
let me ask-- %$* 13
we will have medicare for all. %$* 469
let me ask your partner, ken connor this point. %$* 13
we do have smaller versions of single payer systems. %$* 13
we have medicare, we have the veterans administration. %$* 13
they have to make decisions. %$* 13
they have to cut costs. %$* 13
do they need to-- %$* 13
do they need to have a system of rationing in the system that exists now as opposed to-- %$* 13
as opposed to what you're proposing a solution which just is not the world that we're in today? %$* 13
well, i think it's important to understand, as a practical matter, the truth of the notion that he who pays the piper gets to call the tune. %$* 468
and so it's a practical matter. %$* 468
whoever's making those payments, in large measure, is going to call the shots. %$* 468
what we advocate, though, in contrast to a central bureaucratized, central planning, decision making process is that we have consumer-driven decision making, informed by medical advice, mediated by markets. %$* 468
we believe that that system is a better system than the government system. %$* 468
we believe that that system is a better system and that those-- %$* 468
that's a better way to make decisions than relegating it to the people who brought us the bridge to nowhere, solyndra, the wall street bailout. %$* 468
now, look-- %$* 468
look, folks, plain and simple. %$* 468
there's an economic concept that our physician friend may not be aware of. %$* 468
it's called opportunity cost. %$* 468
and-- %$* 468
and your proposition assumes the fallacy of only two alternatives: either we recoup the money from the sick and dying, or we don't. %$* 468
but my point is there are other ways to recoup the money from other areas where we are wasting money. %$* 468
and it's much easier to balance budgets on the back of the sick and dying than to wrench it out of the hands of the special interests in washington. %$* 468
arthur kellermann. %$* 13
i'm real glad i got a chance to talk. %$* 466
let's talk for just a moment about exhibit a, sally. %$* 466
as a doctor, i've got to tell you, i've heard that story before. %$* 466
and i don't think â€“ %$* 466
remind people just tuning in to-- %$* 13
oh, yes. %$* 466
the story earlier about your mother not getting the colonoscopy she needed. %$* 466
and i feel badly about what happened. %$* 466
but i have to tell you, i don't think a government bureaucrat was the one who made the mistake. %$* 466
i think you got a bad doc. %$* 466
and the fact of the matter is-- %$* 466
i know this may come as a shock, sometimes canadians screw up. %$* 466
if they didn't, we'd never win the stanley cup. %$* 466
and mr. %$* 466
connor-- %$* 466
and canadians are really nice people. %$* 469
yeah. %$* 466
and they are very patient, not like patients in need. %$* 469
yeah. %$* 466
mr. %$* 466
connor-- %$* 466
i'm with you, brother, on the market incentive. %$* 466
so let me suggest a market-based solution to what we're talking about. %$* 466
i think there's a big difference between deciding what we as a society can afford to commit folks to get, whether it's in icu at the end of the life or whether it's at 25 years old when you're trying to get your first job and starting a family. %$* 466
and let's commit to that level of financial protection and coverage that we all kind of want to buy into. %$* 466
if beyond that, whatever that is, whatever we as a country decide we are prepared to shoulder, you can buy it. %$* 466
sally, you could buy it. %$* 466
if you want avastin, and it's worth $100,000 a year to pay for it out of your pocket, and you want to use your children's inheritance, go for it. %$* 466
it's okay with me. %$* 466
but i've got a problem with you using our inheritance to buy your avastin if we don't have the evidence that it makes a difference. %$* 466
so let's have a market-based solution. %$* 466
that's the deal today that 50 million uninsured americans get, except they don't even get a basic level of coverage. %$* 466
it's all out of pocket, or it's on the charity and mercy of individual doctors and hospitals. %$* 466
that's a pretty lousy deal. %$* 466
well, when you analyze the 48.6 million americans who are uninsured, it doesn't mean they don't get healthcare. %$* 469
anyone in this country under the federal law can turn up an emergency room-- %$* 469
i know we take care of them. %$* 466
so but let's look at that 48.6 million. %$* 469
14 million of them are people who are eligible for medicaid and chip and haven't signed up. %$* 469
we're going to be adding 11 to 12 million more to medicaid under the affordable care act. %$* 469
why have these people not signed up for medicaid? %$* 469
well, i believe doctors are reimbursed 35 to 42 percent below what they get from treating private patients. %$* 469
so medicaid patients find it very difficult to get a doctor. %$* 469
this is only going to get worse. %$* 469
the other point is that there are about 20 million of these people are people that are young people, like a lot of you in this audience. %$* 469
you're between 18 and 31.you're the young invincible. %$* 469
you don't want to spend $400 to $500 a month on healthcare. %$* 469
so you don't. %$* 469
you'll pay out of pocket when you need it. %$* 469
there are only about 9 million americans who are chronically ill without health insurance for a period of two years or more. %$* 469
those are the people that i want to take care of and that we should be taking care of. %$* 469
but you know, in the uk, in the country, if you decide that you want to buy avastin because the actuaries have said your quality adjusted value of life is not worth the 80 to 90,000 a year for avastin, you can pay out of pocket. %$* 469
but you are then out of the national health service. %$* 469
the government says you cannot get any more treatment from the government. %$* 469
and i feel that is not fair. %$* 469
yeah, but we don't support that system. %$* 467
i mean, that's not-- %$* 467
i know. %$* 469
but this is what-- %$* 469
under the pcori under ipab, under accountable care, this is what is going to happen to people in this country. %$* 469
let me bring in peter. %$* 13
let me bring in peter singer. %$* 13
well, let me just say, i mean, i've spent most of my life in australia as you can probably tell from the funny way i speak. %$* 467
and we have universal health coverage, but we also have private insurance. %$* 467
it's not like canada. %$* 467
you're not out of the medicare, as we call it. %$* 467
you're not out of that scheme by taking out private insurance. %$* 467
it just gives you, if you want to do that, extra coverage for various things that you can do. %$* 467
so it's an option and-- %$* 467
all right. %$* 13
i don't feel i'm doing a very good job as moderator tonight. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
because i want to shape this back to what we're talking about as a tradeoff of what you get for what you pay, and are you willing to pay it, and is it wrong to deny that payment? %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
you know, ken connor, you actually did put your finger on it when you said that, he who is paying the cost gets to call the tunes on this. %$* 13
and right now we are in a world where medicare is taking care of an awful lot of people. %$* 13
and it's very expensive. %$* 13
we know a crisis is coming. %$* 13
given where we are on that, their argument that at some point you have to say no, and let's figure out a way to say no, and let's make it fair for everybody, which is the principle of rationing, that if there's not enough of something to go around, you set up a system so that everybody gets an equal shot at it. %$* 13
but everybody doesn't get all of what they want. %$* 13
just-- %$* 13
just that concept, what do you think of-- %$* 13
what is wrong with that? %$* 13
because i know you think that it's wrong. %$* 13
well, i think you're talking about fundamental fairness here. %$* 468
let's think of it in these terms: how fair is it when you pay into something all your life, you get to the end of your life, when you really need it, you've been told that you're paying in to receive healthcare, and you get down to the point when you really need it and say-- %$* 468
and the government says, "sorry, you're going to cost us too much." isn't there a fundamental fairness issue in that regard? %$* 468
no. %$* 468
we're going to take the money that you paid in over time, over all these years, and we're going to give it to younger people because they don't need as much of it as you do. %$* 468
isn't that why we paid into it all of our lives? %$* 468
isn't that-- %$* 468
isn't that part of fundamental fairness, is getting what you pay for? %$* 468
okay. %$* 13
and the question we'll put to this side out of this is that he's actually portraying what sounds like a very ugly situation. %$* 13
you're old, you're-- %$* 13
you got two years left. %$* 13
we got a limited amount of money. %$* 13
that group of kids over there, they've got all their lives in front of you. %$* 13
sorry, charlie. %$* 13
you're off the boat. %$* 13
it does sound ugly, nasty, and very hard to take. %$* 13
and i want you to take on that side of the argument. %$* 13
well, the only problem is that's not how it works, and that's not what we're talking about. %$* 466
that is what we're talking about. %$* 13
i mean, we're talking about, again-- %$* 466
no, it is-- %$* 13
but, art, it's-- %$* 13
we are talking about having to make these hard choices and saying no to some people. %$* 13
yeah, well, no, what we're saying is we want to give everybody good, decent, high- quality, evidence-based medicine and care, including and especially palliative care at the end of life. %$* 466
but if you want a super expensive drug or an unorthodox treatment, it costs a freaking fortune. %$* 466
and it is way beyond what we think as a society private insuranceâ€™s actuaries or the government's actuaries or the institute of medicine says is reasonable, then we should not, as a society, be obliged to go along for the ride. %$* 466
you should be able to pay for that out of pocket or in any other way you want to do it. %$* 466
that's a fundamental difference in saying, "no, you can't have it at all." and let me remind you, we talked about wasteful spending earlier-- %$* 466
but wasn't peter describing a situation in the u.k. where they do look at specific treatments and they say, "if you want to stay in the national health, you can't have it at all"? %$* 13
well, i'm sorry. %$* 466
i thought we were in the united states. %$* 466
no-- %$* 467
but peter used the united kingdom system as an example so i think itâ€™s on the table-- %$* 13
well, yeah, but let me just mention something that i think weâ€™ve got to put on the table because i don't know how much time we're going to have, a cynical colleague of mine once said, "americans don't mind throwing people overboard, they just don't like to hear the splash." and there's an awful lot of people that are getting thrown overboard every day in this country that we're not debating about tonight. %$* 466
no, it's really important. %$* 466
sally told a story-- %$* 466
i'll just briefly tell a story. %$* 466
early in my career, i saw a woman in her 30s, a mother of three, who rolled in the door with a hemorrhagic stroke, her blood vessel burst in her brain, she was neurologically devastated. %$* 466
we incubated her, we did everything that sally and ken would want. %$* 466
we gave her a full court all out best we could humanly do, and we could not save her life. %$* 466
i went to break the news to her sisters, and they told me that three weeks earlier she'd lost her job, lost her coverage, could not afford her three blood pressure medicines, and was forced to choose between groceries for her kids or medicine for herself. %$* 466
she chose her kids like any mother in this audience would choose, and she paid for it with her life. %$* 466
her life had value. %$* 466
she died. %$* 466
we spent more money in the last three hours of a completely futile effort to save her life that could have kept her in blood pressure medicine her whole life, raised her kids, paid her taxes, contributed to our country. %$* 466
those people matter, too! %$* 466
i want to take questions from the audience, but i just want to finish this up. %$* 13
should she have been denied that service since it didn't make sense economically? %$* 13
what? %$* 466
the extraordinary effort-- %$* 13
no, because early on you don't know how things are going to turn out and you-- %$* 466
but at some point you say-- %$* 466
and, again, what we said-- %$* 466
opening conversation here is the most important discussion to have is between a physician and the patient with an honest sharing of information, not get pulled into an industrial complex of modern medicine. %$* 466
just remember, we were talking about the affordable care act or obama care earlier. %$* 466
one of the first provisions that got knocked out of it was one that would have given doctors a little money every six months to encourage them to have a conversation with their patients. %$* 466
and you know what we called this, folks? %$* 466
we called it a "death panel." what the hell was that about? %$* 466
let me ask you this question. %$* 468
i don't know 10 doctors in america that thought that was a good idea to knock that out. %$* 466
i'm going to let ken respond. %$* 13
i think you're going with the question, so, yeah, make it a question-- %$* 13
if i may, you've made the point, and you've written about it, it's a good point, that some 15,000 people die estimated every year because of the lack of insurance coverage. %$* 468
easy. %$* 468
then probably due to medicine estimates that 100,000 people die a year from medical malpractice. %$* 468
are you willing to be as aggressive about reforming medical malpractice and ensuring that physicians meet the standard of care for those 100,000 as you are to argue for the 1,000s who don't survive because of a lack of insurance? %$* 468
absolutely. %$* 466
sign me up. %$* 466
and you know what? %$* 466
and while we're at it, let's cut out the $750 billion a year that the institute of medicine says our health care system, the one i work in, is wasting due to inefficiency, wasteful management, missed opportunities for prevention, and fraud, $750 billion, folks. %$* 466
we could do a lot of good with that money. %$* 466
and right then and, if you'll wait a second, a mike will come to you and you can stand up, if you wouldn't mind telling us your name, and just wait for the mic. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i have a question for sally. %$* 19
sally, you-- %$* 19
can you just identify-- %$* 13
right. %$* 19
oh, i'm sorry, john. %$* 19
my name is judith alexander. %$* 19
sally, you were running through how many people are uninsured who could actually receive government assistance if they applied for it. %$* 19
but aren't you being inconsistent, because aren't you against a single payer and yet you seem to be advocating that many of the uninsured take advantage of the programs that really are single payers? %$* 19
well, first of all-- %$* 469
i think i'll pass on the question because i don't think this goes to the issue of rationing unless you want to rephrase. %$* 13
don't single payers ration? %$* 19
yes, definitely, in terms of rationed care, waiting lists, and lack of access to the latest treatments. %$* 469
everyone in america is entitled to health care by turning up at an emergency room. %$* 469
and the real-- %$* 469
the hidden tax is not on the uninsured. %$* 469
it's on the low reimbursement rates by government to doctors and hospitals. %$* 469
that adds about 10 percent to the cost of an insurance plan by people who have private plans. %$* 469
the uninsured only adds 1 percent to the cost of premiums for those who have insurance. %$* 469
response from the other side? %$* 13
you donâ€™t need to if you donâ€™t want to. %$* 13
art kellermann. %$* 13
no, just-- %$* 466
we don't do a really good job of giving chemotherapy and doing a lot of other stuff in ers. %$* 466
i mean, i love practicing emergency medicine. %$* 466
that is the last place that poor and uninsured americans should have to go to get their health care. %$* 466
it doesn't make any sense, and it never has. %$* 466
and it just boggles the mind. %$* 466
i'm sorry. %$* 466
i'll have to recalibrate. %$* 466
i've heard some things that have really got me spinning on this side and i need a moment to figure it out. %$* 466
all right. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
my name's patrick bachelor first, to sally. %$* 18
your story was both tragic-- %$* 18
i think it's irrelevant, unfortunately. %$* 18
obama care is very different than the canadian model, both in terms of who pays for it as well as how it's structured. %$* 18
but to the other side-- %$* 18
don't debate the debaters, please. %$* 13
just ask your question. %$* 13
put the question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
the trick part of the question, i think, tonight is, do we really know what end-of- life is until we get there? %$* 18
there are many, many cases-- %$* 466
i never try to predict for an individual patient. %$* 466
but what i do tell a patient is, "this is the situation. %$* 466
this is what could happen. %$* 466
what do you think is the right thing to do? %$* 466
" and i respect their wishes, and i respect the family's wishes. %$* 466
but you've got to give them honest information. %$* 466
you've got to give people a sense of odds. %$* 466
everybody is one or zero as an individual, but the odds and the outcome and the prognosis really matter, and people need to understand what they're signing up for. %$* 466
ken talked earlier about cruel and unusual punishment. %$* 466
if we took prisoners on death row and subjected them to a week in an american icu, the supreme court would rule that unconstitutional. %$* 466
so it's important to make your choice based on your values. %$* 466
and my advice to you, sir, is to go home tonight and talk to your wife and kids and tell them what you want at the end of the life, so they'll be there to represent your views. %$* 466
i just want to understand, was the thrust of your question, "who knows what a procedure is going to produce? %$* 13
no, it's, "how do you know when you're at that point, at end-of-life? %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
all right, so i think he just answered it. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
my name's tom oldfield great job, everybody. %$* 18
it was very entertaining. %$* 18
i'm holding my phone because i wrote the question on there, but-- %$* 18
could you move the mic a little closer? %$* 13
yeah, absolutely. %$* 18
sorry about that. %$* 18
thinking in two hypotheticals. %$* 18
one, we're thinking 60 years down the road, and the other being that the stereotype that gen-y all think theyâ€™re special is true. %$* 18
which scenario do you think would be more likely? %$* 18
"a," as a result of our lives being so special, that the pool of end-of-life candidates would become so extreme down the road that we have no choice but to make reforms, and have this discussion and ration life care? %$* 18
or "b," would-- %$* 18
as a result of having such a comfortable life, would the-- %$* 18
would the effect of the suffering that goes on during end-of-life become so extreme where the conversation actually switches to people-- %$* 18
do people have the capacity for-- %$* 18
to choose euthanasia, for example? %$* 18
would there be a demand for that? %$* 18
let's take ken connor first on that. %$* 13
i'm not sure i understood your question fully, and i apologize for that. %$* 468
can i restate? %$* 13
you're talking about, are we going to go to a world where-- %$* 13
well, the second scenario you were talking about, are we bound to a world where there are so many sick and elderly people, and we are so unable to pay for it, that people are going to be encouraged to off themselves? %$* 13
that's what you were asking? %$* 13
no. %$* 18
it's actually-- %$* 18
it's actually more of sort of the-- %$* 18
i think of just killing as an example of when your quality of life, the drop-off of your quality of life is greater because of your upbringing, so having a more comfortable upbringing would naturally lead to a greater suffering, even though it's-- %$* 18
yeah, i'm going to pass on the question, because i think there's so many premises that we would end up ripping apart, addressing the many premises. %$* 13
so i'm going to pass on it, but thank you. %$* 13
can you at least talk about the euthanasia? %$* 18
sure. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
i'll be happy to address that. %$* 468
historically, in america, we have maintained that humans - - you know, it's a self-evident truth that human beings are endowed by their creators with certain inalienable rights, the first of which is the right to life. %$* 468
that right to life has been deemed to be the foundation of all other rights because if you don't preserve it, you don't get to enjoy any of the others. %$* 468
now, i fear that rationing opens the door to euthanasia because decisions are made on a utilitarian basis about who lives and who dies. %$* 468
and that's the reason i injected the issue on the front end of this debate about personhood. %$* 468
because dr. %$* 468
singer has maintained that if you lack certain qualities, rationality, the capacity to reflect on your own existence, self-awareness, you're not a person. %$* 468
and he makes the point that if you're not a person, then it is not as morally culpable to destroy that entity than it otherwise would be for-- %$* 468
but ken, he's not-- %$* 13
he's not making that argument. %$* 13
well, my point ultimately goes to this: is that when we use these utilitarian criterion to decide who lives and who dies effectively, we wind up redefining who a person is and-- %$* 468
and that gives rise to a potential license to kill which invites euthanasia. %$* 468
peter singer. %$* 13
well, if i can comment on that, i think what we are increasingly finding, and we will in the future, if you're looking to the future, is that more people want to have the right to make their own decisions about when they die, about when they've had enough. %$* 467
at the moment, people generally can say, "i don't want any more treatment." but if there isn't treatment that's keeping them alive, they don't have that choice. %$* 467
now the citizens of oregon, the citizens of washington state, have voted in favor of having that right, at least to get a physician to prescribe the medicine that they know will be lethal that can end their life. %$* 467
the courts in montana have said that citizens there have that right as well. %$* 467
there are several nations in europe that allow that and also allow-- %$* 467
some of them allow a doctor to give a lethal injection as well on the request of the patient, satisfying certain conditions like a second opinion. %$* 467
those countries are satisfied with that. %$* 467
in the netherlands, for example, that's been the case for at least 20 years now. %$* 467
and through different governments, through liberal governments, through conservative governments, through a catholic prime minister who never tried to repeal that law because he knew it was too popular and would be political suicide if he did. %$* 467
so i think that that is actually something that probably is increasingly going to happen as people start to see that this is something that they want for themselves. %$* 467
but that's a matter of choice. %$* 467
that's not a matter of rationing. %$* 467
i want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, who are debating this motion: ration end-of-life care. %$* 13
peter singer, i had the sense that ken connor's point wasn't about voluntary euthanasia, and i think the question was also about a culture in which euthanasia becomes a suggestion overhanging the elderly as they become more and more in number and as they become more difficult to take care of, that this sort of-- %$* 13
i think the question is, will we get to a world once we open the world to explicit rationing where an old person will know that it's time to get on the ice flow and get the pushout. %$* 13
no, i don't believe so. %$* 467
i think there's still going to be the possibility of choosing, providing, of course, as you're saying, that you're not imposing a huge burden on other people by opting for something very expensive and of doubtful benefits. %$* 467
so there are going to be limits there. %$* 467
but i think otherwise people are going to be able to make their choices in accordance with their own values, and there will be some people who'll want to hang on to life as long as possible and other people who will say, life has lost whatever quality is had that i think makes it worth living, and i think it's time to go. %$* 467
but don't you think, peter, that these decisions should be made between doctors and family and the patient in conjunction? %$* 469
and living wills is an area that is expanding because if you have a living will, you can say so that when you're very ill you won't-- %$* 469
it's not as if you're under anesthetic or under drugs, you've actually made a decision. %$* 469
i know it's hard to figure out when that time will be, but i think living wills are a great way to put things down. %$* 469
but i think doctors and families and the person who is ill should be making these decisions. %$* 469
and we shouldn't be so concerned about the cost to the system because we have a lot of weight in our system right now. %$* 469
yeah, i entirely agree. %$* 467
the decisions about living and about voluntary euthanasia should be matters between doctors and patients. %$* 467
and that's why i think they're separate from decisions about costs and about when treatment is imposing so much of a burden on others and on the general health budget that it's not something that the public should be paying for. %$* 467
so are we, or i, confusing euthanasia, which is a deliberate act to end life, with the withdrawal of an extraordinary measure which the patient hopes will save his or her life? %$* 13
are those two different things? %$* 13
they are somewhat different things, certainly. %$* 467
again, i think patients should have those choices, and patients might choose that they don't want life support even though that is considered sufficiently cost effective to be worth providing. %$* 467
but that should be a choice. %$* 467
okay. %$* 13
but they are different. %$* 467
ma'am, sorry. %$* 13
i didn't see you. %$* 13
my name is julie goldstein. %$* 19
i am a palliative care physician and educator. %$* 19
and my question is to all of you, but particularly dr. %$* 19
kellermann. %$* 19
i see first hand all the way till that happens, particularly at the end of-- %$* 19
sorry. %$* 13
could you move the mic just a little closer? %$* 13
sure. %$* 19
thanks. %$* 13
and my question is, do you think that if we were to address the waste head on by education, et cetera, that we might save enough money that we wouldn't even need to feel-- %$* 19
we wouldn't have the need to ration? %$* 19
i'm glad you brought that up. %$* 466
i really believe that if we focused on getting rid of bad medicine and eliminating the kind of errors in communication problems that i discussed and reinforced the sustained palliative care, that takes care of 90 percent of this issue. %$* 466
and the rest of it really does come down to a doctor, a patient and their family and what is meaningful and mattering to them. %$* 466
there may well be in a point in society where we have to say that if the other certain amount of dollar value you can pay for it yourself that medicare or private insurance or whatever won't go past that point. %$* 466
but i'm never going to get between an american and their wallet. %$* 466
it's my wallet or your wallet i'm more concerned about in that very unusual circumstance. %$* 466
i just want to double back to the comment about euthanasia and say as a doctor, i'm not ready to go there. %$* 466
but if a patient tells me, in their terminal condition, that they don't want an oxygen mask because they want to kiss their wife, i want to let them kiss their wife. %$* 466
okay. %$* 13
ken connor. %$* 13
well, i affirm, doctor, that the premises of your question, which is if we can eliminate the waste broadly abused, doesn't that obviate the need for rationing? %$* 468
and that was the point i tried to make in my opening statement, is that the alternative is not simply ration or not. %$* 468
the question is whether or not we're going to continue to waste money and then promote the need for rationing because of it. %$* 468
now, the institute of medicine reports, for instance, that we spend $75 billion a year because of healthcare fraud. %$* 468
190 billion in excess administrative costs. %$* 468
inefficiently delivered services, $130 billion a year. %$* 468
now, my point is this: it's easier to argue for balancing the budget on the backs of the old people who aren't voting and who don't have lobbyists and who don't have packs than it is to try to rest the money away from the people who are-- %$* 468
who are perpetuating the fraud or rendering these services inefficiently. %$* 468
and so i'm saying, let's not take the path of least resistance. %$* 468
let's not take the lazy man's way out. %$* 468
let's do what we need to do to reform wasteful spending and not-- %$* 468
not force ourselves into a position where we think we have to ration healthcare at the expense of the elderly. %$* 468
you just lost me there, ken, because i thought you said earlier that what we wanted to do was to get government out of the business and let doctors do whatever the heck they want. %$* 466
but you just told us we were wasting $750 billion, so i-- %$* 466
when healthcare providers perpetrate fraud, government has a legitimate interest in stopping that fraud. %$* 468
that's a perfectly appropriate role for government. %$* 468
but it isn't just fraud. %$* 467
i mean, the problem is that the financial incentives in the market system, that the opposition are defending all the way, provide incentives to do more. %$* 467
here is an example. %$* 467
the national rate of cesarean sections is 34 percent of births. %$* 467
there's an outfit called intermountain in utah healthcare that has a cesarean rate of 20 percent. %$* 467
it saved $50 million by doing fewer cesarean sections. %$* 467
but it cost it money. %$* 467
it lost money by doing fewer cesarean sections, by saving the system $50 million it suffered a financial hit itself because the financial incentives are to do more and you get paid more, and you can pay-- %$* 467
you can build up your financial base, expand, stop, et cetera. %$* 467
so this is the problem with allowing this to be done through the free market. %$* 467
we need something that puts a lid on not just fraud but also the incentives to do more medical treatments. %$* 467
thank you. %$* 19
i'm peggy lester. %$* 19
and i've been a nurse for 30 years in an emergency room here in town. %$* 19
my question for everyone on the panel is if-- %$* 19
you know, the profit issue of all of this is what seems to me is what the issue is. %$* 19
and so eventually i see it that insurance companies, if we privatize everything, insurance companies will come to a point where they're not making a profit, and that they will then begin to ration care, which they actually already do. %$* 19
so i would like you to speak to, i think, any time we have a health care system that depends that everybody's going to make a profit off of it, we really don't do the best thing for everybody involved. %$* 19
so if you could just comment on that. %$* 19
do you mind if i tweak your question slightly? %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 19
i don't think very much, but to ask sally pipes just, to your point, that ultimately, if you do go to an all private system, that private companies would have the same-- %$* 13
exactly the same motives to ration as anybody else, and that there would be rationing under the program that you're talking about. %$* 13
well, first of all, i'd like to say that-- %$* 469
so are you good with that? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
under the affordable care act, i believe with the essential benefit plan that will be part of these exchanges, where government is going to determine what is a package, what is in the mandate, what insurance companies are going to be able to charge, i believe that a number of insurance companies are going to get out of the insurance market because it's not profitable for them to stay in the market. %$* 469
and so we've already seen principal financial in indiana dropped all health insurance, 800,000 people lost their coverage, and-- %$* 469
but-- %$* 19
no, just a minute aetna and several other-- %$* 469
i've seen that on television recently. %$* 13
oh, yeah. %$* 469
aetna and some other companies have already done that. %$* 469
i know that united health is not writing individual policies in california because it's just too expensive, too much regulation. %$* 469
so, you know, i believe that medicare should be there for those seniors who really need it. %$* 469
medicaid should be there for those people who are at 133 percent below the poverty level. %$* 469
i think that medicaid should be granted to the states so that they can make these decisions. %$* 469
i'm not saying the whole system should be private, but i'm saying if we can move away from employer based coverage to an individual system-- %$* 469
okay, but-- %$* 13
all right, but-- %$* 13
i have to interrupt you because i do have an internal sense of the question not being answered. %$* 13
and the question was, "won't insurance companies-- %$* 13
if you went to a private system, won't insurance companies end up with exactly the same need to conserve resources and we heard this woman saying for the sake of making profit, but whatever the reason is, won't they have to conserve resources and end up rationing anyway? %$* 13
well, there's always going to be rationing, but the question is "who do you want to be doing the rationing? %$* 469
" do you want government to be making decisions about your care, or do you want an insurance company which doesn't-- %$* 469
isn't full of fraud and abuse-- %$* 469
as obama said "medicare and medicaid, $500 billion in fraud and abuse." if those programs are so great, why are they the programs that have all the fraud and abuse in them? %$* 469
okay, john-- %$* 466
oh, okay, art, yes, sir. %$* 13
may i weigh in on that? %$* 468
i come back to the premise that i outlined earlier. %$* 468
and that is that we should be able to make consumer driven decisions, informed by the medical community, mediated by markets. %$* 468
now, the difference between markets and the government is that within markets you have a choice. %$* 468
and so if you don't like the way the insurance company is rationing your care or the circumstances that it requires for you to participate in, then you have alternatives. %$* 468
when you're in a one size fits all government program, you have no alternatives. %$* 468
you have lost your liberty in that regard. %$* 468
all right. %$* 13
i don't feel like there is a need from a response from this side because the question was posed to this side, so i'm going to go on to another question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
this is a question about rationing, correct, and whether or not ethically we at the government have the right to ration, is that-- %$* 18
yeah, i would say so. %$* 13
so last year my father-- %$* 18
sorry-- %$* 18
my brother-in-law's father was in a car accident, had his spine severed, and was in the hospital for six months, icu, back and forth. %$* 18
he actually-- %$* 18
i think he had bills for about $1.5 million. %$* 18
so with that, he was 72.i want to put out a hypothetical story. %$* 18
you have three gentlemen, 72 years old. %$* 18

the rosenkranz foundation “intelligence squared u.s.” “spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea” %$* 33
. i’d like to introduce at this point, uh, the person who, who really, uh %$* 45
makes these, these debates possible. %$* 45
and that’s robert rosenkranz who’s chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, sponsor of the evening’s debate. %$* 45
and bob is gonna make some opening remarks. %$* 45
and i’m hearing some— %$* 45
well, thank—thank you, robert, very much,  %$* 1
with me tonight is dana wolfe, our executive producer, and i’d like to just extend a very warm welcome to all of you, at this, the opening debate of our second series. %$* 1
intelligence squared was formed with the goal of raising the level of public discourse in america. %$* 1
the concept is to frame a provocative proposition on a hot-button topic. %$* 1
the panel of experts attempts to convince us to vote, either for or against the proposition. %$* 1
the audience votes before hearing the debate, participates during a question period and then decides who has carried the day with their final vote. %$* 1
the response to this format has been really wonderful. %$* 1
every one of our debates has sold out. %$* 1
uh, we’re produced for radio by wnyc and carried on, uh, 70 national public radio stations around the country. %$* 1
and tonight’s proceedings, uh, will be aired on public television as well, on channel 13 wnet here in—in new york. %$* 1
well, american foreign policy has often been energized by a sense of moral conviction. %$* 1
most of us have a strong conviction in the merits of the system that includes freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, rule of law, respect for property rights, and an elaborate balancing of power between the, uh, various branches of government. %$* 1
this is perhaps, uh, are the elements of what fareed zakaria has called liberal democracy. %$* 1
and they may be the elements we have in mind when we seek to encourage democracy in other nations. %$* 1
but our founders were as fearful of the tyranny of the mob as they were of the tyranny of the king. %$* 1
they constructed a constitution that requires far more than a simple majority at a single moment in time to subvert these liberal elements. %$* 1
when democracy means simply the use of a ballot box to choose a leader, the merits become far more problematic. %$* 1
and that’s the subject of tonight’s debate. %$* 1
should the us encourage democracy in countries where the best- organized and most politically powerful groups are islamic radicals? %$* 1
how should we react to an elected hamas? %$* 1
what do we make of polls that show that 65% of middle easterners do not believe that spreading democracy is a real us objective? %$* 1
on the other hand, if the us does not encourage democratic ideas, are we merely cynical supporters of despotic regimes and narrow elites? %$* 1
do we ignore the large, uh, majority of muslims that believe that democracy will work in their countries? %$* 1
can such an approach galvanize, uh, domestic support. %$* 1
and if not, can we prudently, uh, take a hands-off approach to a region of the world that is so— of such enormous geopolitical significance. %$* 1
well these are vexing questions indeed and present a real conundrum for us policy. %$* 1
but fortunately we have a distinguished panel of experts to turn to this evening. %$* 1
our moderator, robert siegel, is the senior host of national public radio’s award-winning program “all things considered,” and is the radio host of the intelligence squared series. %$* 1
he got started in radio broadcasting when he was a college freshman, in 1964, and he’s still at it. %$* 1
he’s reported from europe, the middle east, and across the us, and for four years, directed npr’s news and information department. %$* 1
welcome back, robert. %$* 1
i’d like to welcome you to this, the first debate of the second series of the intelligence squared us debates, tonight’s motion is, “spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea.” i’m gonna give you a brief rundown of what will happen this evening, first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting that side of the argument, and the opposition will follow, and each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go back and forth, from one side to the other. %$* 33
second, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks, i’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 33
third, when the question-and- answer is complete, each debater will make a final statement, no more than two minutes per person. %$* 33
fourth, after the final closing statement is made, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that’s attached to the arm-rest of your seat. %$* 33
and fifth and last, i will announce the results of the audience vote, and i’ll tell you which side carried the day. %$* 33
now, before hearing from our panelists, i’d like to start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 33
and i’d like you to pick up the keypad that’s attached to the, uh, arm-rest on your left. %$* 33
for audience members who are sitting on the aisle to my right, uh, your keypad is attached to the arm-rest on your right side next to your neighbor’s. %$* 33
and when i tell you, after my prompt, you will press “1,” to vote for the motion, “2” to vote against the motion, and “3” if you’re undecided, i’m gonna repeat the—the motion, which is that “spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea.” “1” is for, “2” is against, “3” is undecided, and you may begin voting now. %$* 33
i hope you’ve been able to vote by now, i will reveal the results of the pre-debate vote later in the evening, but now though i’d like to introduce our panel. %$* 33
starting with those who will speak for the motion, a senior fellow at the new america foundation, former director for middle east affairs at the national security council, flynt leverett. %$* 33
the the founding president of the nixon center and publisher of its foreign-policy magazine the national interest, dimitri simes. %$* 33
uh, the anwar sadat professor for peace and development at the university of maryland, and also a non-resident senior fellow at the saban center of the brookings institution, shibley telhami. %$* 33
and now, the side against the motion, former near eastern affairs principal deputy assistant secretary, and coordinator for broader middle east initiatives at the us department of state, liz cheney. %$* 33
vice-president for foreign and defense policy studies at the american enterprise institute, danielle pletka. %$* 33
and the director of the adelson institute for strategic studies at the shalem center in jerusalem, natan sharansky. %$* 33
let’s start a debate. %$* 33
flynt leverett. %$* 33
good evening. %$* 227
it’s a pleasure to kick off tonight’s debate. %$* 227
i’m gonna start by telling you a couple of things that my colleagues and i are not arguing, in our support for tonight’s resolution. %$* 227
first, in arguing that spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea, my colleagues and i are not arguing that the people of the middle east—whether defined as arabs, muslims, or in any other way—are inherently less capable of democratic development than any other ethnic, cultural or religious group. %$* 227
second, we do not question the desirability of democracy, or the benefits of living under a democratic political order. %$* 227
i have the good fortune of being an american citizen solely through the accident of my birth. %$* 227
but my two colleagues tonight, came to this country from elsewhere, and embraced american citizenship by choice, precisely because they are convinced of democracy’s desirability. %$* 227
in arguing that spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea, my colleagues and i want to look at tonight’s resolution through the prism of american national interests. %$* 227
of course us interests in the middle east are complex and multifaceted, but i’m gonna boil down our most important interests in this critical region to three things. %$* 227
first, the free flow of oil from the persian gulf, second, the security and welfare of the state of israel, and third, keeping the middle east from providing a platform for further mass-casualty terrorist attacks of the sort that we suffered on 9-11.i will argue for tonight’s resolution because i believe that promoting democracy in the middle east is not just not helpful for these interests, it is downright harmful to them. %$* 227
let’s look first at terrorism. %$* 227
president bush and his administration’s defenders have argued since the united states began preparing to invade iraq, that spreading democracy in the middle east is the essential antidote to jihadist terrorism originating in the region. %$* 227
but there is literally not a shred of hard evidence supporting that proposition. %$* 227
from osama bin laden on down, that claim that jihadist terrorists are products of economic and political marginalization is simply false. %$* 227
the 9-11 hijackers were truly trust-fund terrorists, from economically and politically advantaged backgrounds. %$* 227
proponents of democracy promotion in the middle east also argue, that democratization is needed to counteract the distorting effects of madrasa educations on the mind-set of millions of young arabs and muslims in the region. %$* 227
but the fact is that al qaeda and other internationally active terrorist groups, don’t recruit from madrasas. %$* 227
look at it in practical terms. %$* 227
to be an internationally active jihadist terrorist, you need, for example, english language skills, you need a certain level of technical competence. %$* 227
madrasas are not the place where one acquires that kind of skill-set. %$* 227
that’s why al qaeda and other internationally active jihadist terrorist groups recruit primarily among university students and university graduates. %$* 227
indeed if you look at the backgrounds of terrorists who have been recruited over the years by al qaeda, you find the number-one subject that they studied at university was engineering, the number-two subject was medicine. %$* 227
democracy promotion is not going to win the war on terror, in fact the bush administration has tacitly acknowledged that promoting democracy is not winning the war on terror. %$* 227
since 2005, in the annual patterns of global terrorism report, the administration has, as a matter of policy, withheld publishing the aggregate statistics showing the number of significant terrorist incidents around the world each year. %$* 227
they withhold that information, i would suggest, not because the data show that the number of incidents is getting less. %$* 227
it is actually getting greater-- %$* 227
democracy promotion will not help us win the war on terror. %$* 227
now let’s turn to israel’s place in the region. %$* 227
proponents of democratization in the middle east often advance what i call the garbage-collection model of lowering palestinian and arab expectations. %$* 227
this model assumes that palestinians and their sympathizers in the arab and muslim worlds don’t really care that much about palestinians living under occupation, that palestinian and other arab leaders use israel as a convenient way to deflect popular attention from their own performance. %$* 227
i myself heard president bush argue in the white house situation room, that a democratically-elected palestinian government would be more focused on collecting garbage, and less, quote- unquote, “hung up” on territory and the status of jerusalem. %$* 227
well, we tested this theory in the 2006 palestinian elections, and the result was hamas’s victory in internationally supervised balloting in the west bank and gaza. %$* 227
the hard reality is that negotiating peace between arab states and israel is not popular in the middle east. %$* 227
arab-israel peacemaking requires that arab states—that, that the united states work with indigenous regimes in arab states that are prepared to pursue peace with israel, not because it is popular, but because those leaders judge it to be in their countries’ national interests. %$* 227
this is the approach that was pursued by anwar sadat in the camp david accords. %$* 227
sadat paid the ultimate price for that initiative. %$* 227
but it is the model that has been followed by his successor, president mubarek, by king hussein and his successor king abdullah in jordan. %$* 227
it is the model that is being followed today by saudi king abdullah in the arab league peace initiative. %$* 227
promoting democracy in the middle east will not enhance the prospects for arab-israel peacemaking, it will in fact, harm prospects for peace. %$* 227
the same argument can also be extended to eliciting the absolutely essential cooperation of regional regimes, to enable the united states to play its critical role as the guarantor of physical security for persian gulf oil fields. %$* 227
the legacy of 20th century colonialism in the middle east, oil concessions, and all the rest, mean that it is not popular for regional regimes to cooperate with hegemonic power. %$* 227
while there is no evidence that democracy reduces the incidence of terrorism, there is ample evidence—from places like egypt and saudi arabia—that holding more open elections in these and other societies would produce governments that are more anti-american than incumbent regimes. %$* 227
given this reality, how is it in america’s interest to rush these countries’ populations into voting booths? %$* 227
a couple of final points. %$* 227
advocate of democracy promotion in the middle east, oftentimes argue that— %$* 227
—by promoting democracy, we are also promoting the spread of liberal values, the emancipation of women, um %$* 227
and other things that americans hold right and dear. %$* 227
and %$* 227
they often suggest that, if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda, we really are—to use mr. %$* 227
rosenkranz’s phrase—cynical supporters of despotic regimes. %$* 227
but, if you look at popular attitudes in the arab and muslim world, these attitudes are not just increasingly anti-american in their orientation toward international issues. %$* 227
they are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent regimes. %$* 227
the best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization, in the arab and muslim worlds today, lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that, first of all— %$* 227
—economic modernization is essential to their country’s future. %$* 227
one. %$* 33
—by promoting democracy, we are also promoting the spread of liberal values, the emancipation of women, um %$* 227
and other things that americans hold right and dear. %$* 227
and %$* 227
they often suggest that, if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda, we really are—to use mr. %$* 227
rosenkranz’s phrase—cynical supporters of despotic regimes. %$* 227
but, if you look at popular attitudes in the arab and muslim world, these attitudes are not just increasingly anti-american in their orientation toward international issues. %$* 227
they are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent regimes. %$* 227
the best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization, in the arab and muslim worlds today, lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that, first of all— %$* 227
thank you— %$* 33
—economic modernization is essential to their country’s future. %$* 227
thank you, flynt leverett, speaking for the motion. %$* 33
danielle pletka, against the motion. %$* 33
good evening, everybody. %$* 228
you saw me looking around in a little bit of a panic and that’s because i realized i left my glasses in the other room. %$* 228
so i’m just going to hold this a little bit further forward, if you’ll forgive me. %$* 228
before anything else, let us all agree that democracy is a good, in and of itself. %$* 228
it doesn’t require a wit as sharp as winston churchill’s to know that, stacked up against dictatorship, mob rule or even benevolent tyranny, democracy – notwithstanding all of its imperfections, is the best system of government. %$* 228
let’s also accept that democracy means a great deal more than elections and that when we say democracy we’re really using a shorthand for a system that contemplates representative leadership, rule of law, economic as well as political freedoms and more. %$* 228
finally, let’s stipulate that while we expect our news to arrive instantaneously, our paychecks to be deposited immediately and our diets to work miraculously, democracy is indeed a long term project. %$* 228
i’m pleased to see that flynt, shibley %$* 228
shibley, uh, dimitri, uh, have accepted the idea that the system of government most admired in the middle east is democratic and that they agree that people do indeed aspire to freedom in that region. %$* 228
and i must say i agree with the caveat that people do not aspire to freedom that is eclipsed by fear for the future and for their own security and well being. %$* 228
so we have a moral good that we are all agreed upon in the abstract. %$* 228
what we don’t agree about is the strategic imperative or the appropriate role of the united states. %$* 228
we can debate about that a little bit later but the foundation of that debate should be a proper understanding of the nexus between tyranny and terrorism. %$* 228
how do groups like al qaeda operate? %$* 228
it should be clear by now that in parasitic fashion these groups feed off of host nations that are weak. %$* 228
they operate with a key, with a core group who are committed ideologues and do come from all walks of life. %$* 228
but the real sustenance, but that is, that is only part of the story. %$* 228
the real sustenance for al qaeda and other light groups is an environment that tolerates their methods in appreciation of their supposed ideals. %$* 228
for many it is not necessarily the virgins that await or the triumphs of the return of the caliphate. %$* 228
rather, it is the relief from the life in purgatory that constitutes the average lot of the average arab. %$* 228
that life is about unemployment, real rates of up to thirty-five and forty per cent – and young men, who when polled consistently complain that their existence offers no hope and no opportunity. %$* 228
it is about the fact that the united nations development program estimates that nine per cent of every business deal in the middle east goes for bribes and when students who want to vote step into the streets of cairo they risk arrest and torture, like karim suleiman who was sodomized and tortured because he demonstrated in favor of the rule of law. %$* 228
these victims of middle eastern oppression are the ones who provide the oxygen that enables al qaeda to operate and it gives resonance to their political messages. %$* 228
and why? %$* 228
if your life and your father’s life and your son’s life is lived under the yoke between this or dictator for life that, you cannot form a new political organization and you cannot change your system of government and you cannot begin to help yourself and you look for other options. %$* 228
and if the only haven in which you can talk about those options is in the mosque and the only thing the mosque is offering up is islamic purity, a return to greatness and the uncorrupted life of the true believer, it shouldn’t be a great wonder that such ideas take hold. %$* 228
if you find that argument unpersuasive let’s for a moment look from our opponent’s viewpoint. %$* 228
they rightly suggest that in egypt, jordan, syria, lebanon, saudi arabia, kuwait, palestine – i could go on – the main opposition parties are islamist. %$* 228
but why? %$* 228
it’s because they have a proven record of delivering on a better life? %$* 228
is it because somehow they have more charisma than other opponents of the regime? %$* 228
or is the fact that the islamists have successfully used the vast religious networks and cash available to them to promote their own political cause – occupying the only political space that exists in the authoritarian arab world. %$* 228
there are only two places for breathing room in the current middle eastern political construct-- %$* 228
the dictator space and the islamists. %$* 228
oppression gives the islamists the popularity to move their agenda and further the environment in which al qaeda is tolerated and worse. %$* 228
and they know it. %$* 228
in extensive writings, including by bin laden and zarqawi-- %$* 228
and here i really disagree with what flynt had to say – they rail against democracy because they know it represents a threat to their lifeline. %$* 228
zarqawi wrote to ayman al-zawahiri bemoaning the future of their fight in iraq. %$* 228
democracy is coming, he wrote, and there will be no excuse thereafter. %$* 228
so what is the answer? %$* 228
the answer cannot be that because hamas and others take advantage of the democratic process, therefore, democracy is discredited. %$* 228
we must confront systems that tolerate islamists and provide ideological safe haven to al qaeda. %$* 228
and the way to do that is by insuring that there are other opposition parties, genuine reformers, who have the power and the money to make their voices heard. %$* 228
our opponents will argue that the united states has no role to play, that where we interfere we make things worse and that with our inconsistency we risk destabilizing the region. %$* 228
that is an unacceptable formulation. %$* 228
it is certainly true that the united states is not a fault free advocate for democracy. %$* 228
i can now agree that there are times when the reality of foreign policy demands that we do business with objectionable leaders. %$* 228
but there is no reason to rely on the brutality of dictators because that brutality at the end only besmirches us. %$* 228
worse still, there is clear evidence that jihadists flourish where dictators rule. %$* 228
in supporting the plo, what did we do to rid gaza and the west bank of hamas in supporting mubarak? %$* 228
what have we done to rid egypt of the muslim brotherhood? %$* 228
sixty years of rooting for the dictator’s stability, as my colleague liz cheney will make clear, didn’t protect us on 9/11.our role must be to facilitate and educate, to hold open the door for democrats like ayman nour in egypt. %$* 228
it should be to use our influence to see laws rescinded to stop the formation of new parties and constrain the grass roots activities of political and economic reformers. %$* 228
it should be to insure that mosques are not the only place where political parties and reformers can meet and it should be to insure that economic reforms go hand in hand with political change. %$* 228
ultimately, when young men can expect unemployment in a thriving market economy, there will still be a few who are attracted to al qaeda – those medical students and those engineers. %$* 228
but the vast mass will not. %$* 228
they will be less attracted to the answers they hear from radical preachers. %$* 228
or do our opponents here this evening really believe that reform is not possible, that reformers do not exist? %$* 228
no one among us has suggested the only way to prize open the closed doors of the middle eastern palaces is with middle eastern %$* 228
is with middle east – excuse me – military force. %$* 228
to the contrary – if that is our system it will fail. %$* 228
the same holds true for al qaeda. %$* 228
we cannot kill every pakistani that tolerates an al qaeda operative in his midst. %$* 228
we cannot bomb houses of worship that preach islamic politics and jihad. %$* 228
we can throw our considerable weight behind the people who do believe that rule of democracy – not jihad and bin laden – offer real hope for the future. %$* 228
we may never do it perfectly but that is certainly not a reason not to do it at all. %$* 228
thank you very much. %$* 228
one. %$* 33
or do our opponents here this evening really believe that reform is not possible, that reformers do not exist? %$* 228

thank you. %$* 33
thank you, danielle pletka, speaking against the motion. %$* 33
shibley telhami, for the motion. %$* 33
good evening. %$* 229
i think, uh, america should stand up for democracy and freedom. %$* 229
i think it should be an inspiring model, as it has been historically. %$* 229
what we shouldn't be doing is trying to pretend like we’re capable of making spreading democracy a top priority in a world in which we face many threats – and certainly not to do it by force. %$* 229
i think, if you look at what has happened over the past five years as a consequence of this policy of spreading democracy by force, is that we have a public and arab world that doesn’t believe us: we have a gov %$* 229
governments that don’t believe us: we have less democracy, more anarchy, more instability, more terrorism – and even worse, the growing american dependence on the very institutions and the very %$* 229
very governments that need to be reformed. %$* 229
in essence, we have given democracy a bad name. %$* 229
it is hard for people in the region, including people who badly and desperately are looking for democracy and freedom, to think of democracy and freedom the american way without thinking about the horrors of iraq. %$* 229
we have paid a price by diverting attention from the important issue of human rights, which we often confuse with spreading democratic systems. %$* 229
that issue which we should trump and advocate has paid a price as a consequence of this policy. %$* 229
let me begin with some of the facts. %$* 229
the vast majority of people in the arab world, all polls show, do not believe that we mean to spread democracy in the middle east. %$* 229
most of them believe that we’re in iraq and in the region for oil, israel and weakening the muslim world. %$* 229
even the governments who have faced pressures from us – and yes, they have faced pressures and, yes, they have been told to liberalize – all have believed that this is essentially tactical, that this is done in order to coerce them to cooperate on strategic issue or as a political domestic issue to divert attention from the absence of wea %$* 229
uh, the weapons of mass destruction in iraq. %$* 229
and as a consequence, they dealt with it tactically. %$* 229
they said, the president needs a little political – give him a little election so he can say, i’ve got more democracy in libya, i’ve got more democracy in, in saudi arabia. %$* 229
and then once he claims that he has a success-- %$* 229
he’s not gonna claim it as a failure the next day - - and then you can go on with business. %$* 229
and look at the reality that we have at the moment. %$* 229
the vast majority of people in the middle east – when you poll them – those people whom we’re supposed to be giving democracy to-- %$* 229
uh, the vast majority believe that the middle east is less democratic today than it was before the iraq war – less dramatic today than it was before iraq war. %$* 229
and it was horribly undemocratic before the iraq war, no doubt. %$* 229
and how is that the case? %$* 229
is this simply made up by the media? %$* 229
is this what people tell them? %$* 229
is this what leaders tell them? %$* 229
i’m afraid there’s a little bit of reality to that and we now see it in many of the places that we celebrated early on as examples of democracy. %$* 229
remember, the three big examples – iraq, lebanon and the palestinian areas-- %$* 229
and you look at where we are in these areas. %$* 229
but separate from that there was some other dynamic that goes on that we are not coming to grips with – something that our policy does because in, in reality we are not making democracy our priority. %$* 229
and we, in essence, deceive ourselves when we think we are. %$* 229
let me give you an example. %$* 229
ninety per cent of the arab public passionately opposed the iraq war, didn’t want to see it take place. %$* 229
they told the governments, don’t do it. %$* 229
it’s gonna bring about ruins. %$* 229
their government’s instinct was, don’t support the iraq war. %$* 229
but when we went to the iraq war-- %$* 229
these governments are certainly dependent on the u.s.-- %$* 229
in the end they came along and they provided logistical support and bases and everything else. %$* 229
and they were telling us that they’re worried about their public opinion. %$* 229
well, we had, it was more important for us that they support our policies on terrorism, on iraq, on the arab/israeli issue, despite the anger of the people, than the liberalization. %$* 229
what happens in the process? %$* 229
how is the jordanian government or the egyptian government or the saudi government going to face up with that pressure that comes from the public at a time of war? %$* 229
what they do is they unleash security services. %$* 229
yes, they have elections-- %$* 229
and by the way, some of those elections we’ve had as little as twenty per cent and possibly only ten per cent of the public participating. %$* 229
it tells you how people, how seriously people took it. %$* 229
but in the end these governments became more repressive in order to quell, to, to, to put down any possible opposition, given the anger of the public. %$* 229
and this is essentially what we do, even in the war on terrorism. %$* 229
who do we think our most important allies in these, uh, countries-- %$* 229
it’s not the democrats. %$* 229
yes, the democrats we theoretically want to empower them. %$* 229
but who do we give most aid to? %$* 229
with whom do we institutionally cooperate – the security services who are embedded with our security services, the military, which are in bed with our military? %$* 229
these are the institutions of the repressions that need to be reformed. %$* 229
but those are the ones we have to deal with. %$* 229
and i’m not saying we don’t need to deal with them. %$* 229
we have to deal with them. %$* 229
but the reality of it is that the consequence is perpetuating repression, increasing it even as we pretend to be promoting it. %$* 229
let me, just a couple of, make a couple of points to end. %$* 229
one is that i believe that all people in the world and all arabs and all muslims want to see freedom and democracy. %$* 229
no one likes dictatorship. %$* 229
and yes, you, i don’t think they want a different kind of democracy and freedom. %$* 229
when i ask them, uh, name two countries where there’s most freedom and democracy for their people they name primarily western countries – western europeans and the u.s.they know what democracy and freedom are. %$* 229
people aspire to it. %$* 229
but one thing they don’t want is they don’t want anarchy. %$* 229
they want anarchy even less than they democracy. %$* 229
and they want to see no occupation. %$* 229
they want freedom but they want to avoid anarchy and they want to avoid occupation. %$* 229
and when they see what is going on in iraq, if a leader in egypt looks at their citizen and say, do you want cairo or do you want baghdad? %$* 229
i want cairo over baghdad any day of the week, with all the pain that people face every day. %$* 229
and that is the reality of how the choices are seen in the region. %$* 229
let me end by saying i am not in harmony with the view that we – %$* 229
shouldn’t advocate democracy. %$* 229
i think we need to advocate democracy. %$* 229
but i believe that there is a better way. %$* 229
i think we should focus on those issues over which there is international consensus, like human rights. %$* 229
we should hold people responsible to treaties that they have signed and in order for us to be powerful in that regard we have to uphold our end of the bargain. %$* 229
we have to be an inspiring model, not just lecture to people while we have the abu ghraib prison. %$* 229
and we need to work in economic reform because that is the structure that enables true democracy to emerge from within. %$* 229
we’re treating arab as a passive people that, that need to be told from the outside. %$* 229
no, they need empowerment from the outside – not manipulation. %$* 229
thank you very much. %$* 229
one. %$* 33
shouldn’t advocate democracy. %$* 229

no, they need empowerment from the outside – not manipulation. %$* 229
thank you very much. %$* 229
thank you, shibley telhami, uh, speaking for the motion. %$* 33
liz cheney, against the motion. %$* 33
uh, there are clearly a number of issues that our opponents would like to debate tonight. %$* 230
and i, too, would welcome those debates. %$* 230
i would readily accept a debate on the topic, "was it right for america to go to war in iraq? %$* 230
" i would readily accept a debate on the topic, "is america effectively promoting democracy in the middle east? %$* 230
" or perhaps one on, "how accurate are opinion polls in the middle east? %$* 230
" and i hope intelligence squared invites me back if they’re gonna have those debates. %$* 230
but those are not the issues before us tonight. %$* 230
although i can understand why our opponents would rather discuss those issues than have to stand before you and argue against democracy. %$* 230
but make no mistake, their protestations aside, that is what they’re doing. %$* 230
the truth is that spreading democracy in the middle east is not a bad idea nor is it a failed idea. %$* 230
nor is it an idea that would have been good except that george w.bush adopted it. %$* 230
it is, by any objective measure, a good idea, the right idea and a necessary policy choice for america today. %$* 230
here are some facts: america is at war with an enemy driven by radical, ideological hatred to destroy us and all that we stand for. %$* 230
these terrorists were not created by u.s.policy. %$* 230
they are religious zealots who will stop at nothing in achieving their objective of establishing a global caliphate in which individual lives have no value, women are chattel and the only legitimate faith is a perverted version of islam. %$* 230
to accomplish their objectives, the terrorists or the trust fund terrorists – as my colleague flynt has called them-- %$* 230
need recruits. %$* 230
because the truth about the trust fund terrorists is they don’t do the dirty work themselves. %$* 230
they’ve got to find young men and women willing to strap bombs onto their bodies, detonate them, killing themselves and taking as many innocents with them as possible. %$* 230
for decades the terrorists have known that they can prey most effectively in societies where young people live in despair, where they have no hope for a better future here on earth – in societies that are characterized by brittle, autocratic regimes and closed status economic systems. %$* 230
for too many years america perpetuated this status quo. %$* 230
we supported those authoritarian regimes, we ignored the aspirations of their people. %$* 230
this policy, essentially the one that our opponents would have us return to tonight, brought only a false sense of security and stability. %$* 230
it is true that young people in the arab world, as elsewhere, yearn for the freedom to be heard. %$* 230
they yearn to stand for something larger than self. %$* 230
they yearn to control their own destinies and choose their own leaders – and only democracy can fulfill those aspirations. %$* 230
our opponents argue there is no evidence that democracy combats terror. %$* 230
to make this argument, you have to ignore the words of the terrorists themselves. %$* 230
if you read the captured letters of former al qaeda and iraq chief, abu musab al-zarqawi-- %$* 230
who my colleague dani pletka quoted – you will see, in 2005 he wrote, quote: we have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to embrace it. %$* 230
the terrorists have done this because they know the fundamental truth – that people never choose to ru %$* 230
be ruled by al qaeda or the taliban. %$* 230
those are the ideologies that must be imposed by force. %$* 230
our opponents tonight also argue that supporting democracy is messy and that elections do not always turn out the way we would like them to. %$* 230
that is certainly true here in america, as well. %$* 230
but that is essentially an argument about how to effectively promote democracy, not one about whether promoting democracy is a bad idea. %$* 230
so let’s dispense with some straw men and agree on several things. %$* 230
promoting democracy is not only about supporting elections. %$* 230
elections are necessary but not sufficient and often they should come last in the reform process, not first. %$* 230
america’s democracy policy should and does include supporting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, women’s rights and a thriving civil society. %$* 230
asserting, as our opponents do, that somehow promoting democracy in the middle east is an imperial imposition of american values requires ignoring two critical facts. %$* 230
the first is you have to ignore that the desire for freedom is a universal human desire. %$* 230
at its base this is an assertion, regardless of what they say, that only some people – maybe those of us fortunate enough to be born in the west – really desire human freedom. %$* 230
at least fifty per cent of our panel tonight is living evidence that that claim is not defensible. %$* 230
our opponents’ position also requires ignoring the massive change underway in the middle east today. %$* 230
five or six years ago state dominated media, state press dominated the media in the region. %$* 230
today there’s been an explosion of independent newspapers, television programming and access to the internet. %$* 230
six years ago no woman had ever run for or voted in an election in the gulf. %$* 230
today they’ve done both. %$* 230
six years ago a demo %$* 230
and discussion about democracy in the arab world would have brought ridicule and potentially jail time. %$* 230
today leaders, reformers, journalists and millions of others are engaged in a constant ongoing debate and discussion about democracy. %$* 230
and america’s actions in this regard matter. %$* 230
as an egyptian reformer said recently, when the outside world softens its call for reform regimes are emboldened to ignore their citizens’ rights. %$* 230
knowing that we are on the side of those fighting for freedom empowers them and it strengthens them. %$* 230
abandoning them or this cause would be unjust and unwise. %$* 230
in that regard, our opponents tonight need to answer this question: if you are truly concerned about america’s credibility and image in the middle east, why are you willing to accept the grave damage that will be done to that credibility if america adopts your approach, if we return to the policy of support for autocrats and turn our backs on the aspirations of the, uh, arab people? %$* 230
finally, consider this: as we engage in this debate here tonight in manhattan, a saudi woman can sit in her home sixty-five miles, fifty-five hundred miles away. %$* 230
she can blog about her life, her fears, her oppression, her hopes and her aspirations. %$* 230
she can post that on the internet for all the world to read. %$* 230
she has a voice, probably for the first time in her life. %$* 230
if we were to tune in right now to any of the scores of arabic satellite channels we would find young men and women from across the region debating the issues of the day, arguing and questioning authority. %$* 230
adopting the path proposed by our opponents would be to betray those young men and women. %$* 230
would our opponents have us tell young arab men and women that america doesn’t believe they’re ready for democracy? %$* 230
would they have us say to women across the gulf that although they have been able, over the last few years, to vote and run – %$* 230
..for office, that was just temporary and america has now decided we won’t support their efforts any longer. %$* 230
would they have us assert that we, in our ultimate wisdom, have decided that instead of supporting freedom fighters, we will throw america’s great and unparalleled strength behind autocrats and against the people? %$* 230
that surely is a world in which the terrorists have won. %$* 230
that is a world in which neither the terrorists nor the americans support democracy and that is not a world in which i imagine many of us would like to live. %$* 230
thank you. %$* 230
one. %$* 33

thank you. %$* 230
thank you, liz cheney, uh, speaking against the motion. %$* 33
dimitri simes, for the motion. %$* 33
this was an interesting presentation. %$* 231
i never knew that i believed in all those things. %$* 231
but it’s always, you know, a learning experience, uh, particularly when you debate bush administration officials or many former administration officials. %$* 231
your kind of plan, what you mean, what you sought and what you said. %$* 231
i don’t think that this was our position and i hope that you will make your own judgment, whether the previous presentation really reflected our side's. %$* 231
how can one be against democracy promotion? %$* 231
a very prominent american leader once said, it is our destiny to promote democracy worldwide because we cannot yield moral ground to repressive regimes because it would be unjust and wrong and because, also, it could be never secure as long as there are repressive regimes. %$* 231
because they would not leave us alone and would continue to plot against us. %$* 231
sorry, france, it was not a prominent american. %$* 231
it was leon trotsky. %$* 231
and of course, he spoke not about promoting democracy but promoting proletarian revolutions. %$* 231
but he believed in proletarian revolutions very strongly. %$* 231
he was a sincere man. %$* 231
so were many crusaders when they invaded the middle east and you remember what has happened and what did it cost – to the arabs, to the christians, to the regions. %$* 231
uh, we are not talking about our private beliefs. %$* 231
we are entitled to our beliefs. %$* 231
but democracy is not a religion. %$* 231
democracy promotion should be policy. %$* 231
therefore i will not hesitate to say that there are some things that are more important than democracy. %$* 231
if, uh, and then in 1930s, we knew what hitler would do to the jews and to the others, would we allow him to come to power democratically? %$* 231
wouldn’t we consider stopping him a wise and honorable policy? %$* 231
and i completely agree with the israelis now when they would not want to recognize democratically elected hamas. %$* 231
and i do not care how many votes hezbollah gets, but as long as they do what they do we should judge them not by the process to which they came to power, but what they’re doing to themselves, to others and what they present to the united states. %$* 231
i would yield to no one in my commitment to freedom. %$* 231
freedom - - to select democracy for us and to freedom to allow others to make their own choices. %$* 231
i am touched by anecdotes about arab women. %$* 231
i don’t need anecdotes when i hear about two and a half million iraqi refugees – two and a half million, for whom in the name of democracy promotion we are doing almost exactly nothing. %$* 231
and more than a hundred thousand civilians who have died so far in iraq and more dying. %$* 231
and our democracy promo %$* 231
promoters don’t seem to be extremely concerned. %$* 231
there was a very prominent american who said, in 1964, that extremism in defense of freedom is no vice. %$* 231
his name was barry goldwater. %$* 231
i disagree. %$* 231
extremism in the name of whatever is never a virtue. %$* 231
and extremism is never a sound policy. %$* 231
first about democracy as something that stop %$* 231
stops wars – remember, the peloponnesian war among the greeks. %$* 231
more than twenty-five hundred centuries ago and there were democracies on both sides. %$* 231
now, i just came from washington. %$* 231
who, uh, do you think burned washington in 1812? %$* 231
my impression is that this was the british. %$* 231
and of course, they had a monarchy but they were very democratic by standards of the time. %$* 231
now, more americans have died in the civil war than in any other war in american history. %$* 231
would you disagree that the confederacy was democratic – at least by the standard of the time? %$* 231
and what about the british in south africa, fighting each other at the end of the 19th century. %$* 231
democracies do go to war against each other. %$* 231
now, about democracy and terrorism – well, you know, i think that one of the most democratic countries i know is called britain. %$* 231
and you see british born citizens engaging in the most vicious terror against their country. %$* 231
well, you would say, but this may be terror imported. %$* 231
well, about, what about the basques in spain? %$* 231
what about ira and their long war against britain? %$* 231
what about the oklahoma city bomber? %$* 231
come on, we know very well that there are many causes of terror. %$* 231
and to say that the absence of democracy in saudi arabia and egypt really is responsible for september 11th-- %$* 231
you know, a claim like that has no scientific evidence whatsoever, is not based on interviews with the terrorists themselves. %$* 231
no senior cia official who knows how these suspects were interviewed and what they said would ever claim that these people have attacked the united states because their arab regimes were not democratic. %$* 231
people love freedom, i completely agree with that. %$* 231
but, you know, when people love freedom they may not only that they would be able to vote or even to enjoy free press or even, uh, freedom of religion or even that they would be able to travel. %$* 231
you know what they also mean? %$* 231
they mean that they want to be able to make their own choices, including to make their own mistakes. %$* 231
and that’s what the american revolution was all about. %$* 231
and when the only remaining super power is coming to other countries and uses considerable american leverage and sometimes american military power telling them, follow our indispensable guidance or else pay the price, then some people are unhappy. %$* 231
and people who are unhappy, are not just despots— %$* 231
—and they’re not just some brainwashed people. %$* 231
india is the greatest democracy, in terms of numbers of people in india, and by now they have a long experience with democracy. %$* 231
and yet india is very strongly against democracy promotion. %$* 231
we should believe in democracy for ourselves, we should promote freedom of choice for others, but we should not presume that we know all the answers, and as the only remaining superpower, we should be the judge and the jury, however noble our intentions may be. %$* 231
one. %$* 33

thank you, dimitri simes, speaking for the motion. %$* 33
natan sharansky, against the motion. %$* 33
you know, in life %$* 232
a disadvantage can sometimes be advantage take being short. %$* 232
i can assure that in soviet prison, being short was a huge advantage. %$* 232
and not only because punishment cells were very small. %$* 232
but because %$* 232
the food is rationed. %$* 232
and clothes come in one size. %$* 232
so for tall people, they’re always hungry, and clothes simply doesn’t cover their body, and protect them from cold. %$* 232
but for people of my size, it was easier with hunger, and i always had an extra cloth, to cover myself, from the cold. %$* 232
and the winters are very cold in gulag. %$* 232
there we were praying for global warming. %$* 232
one can think that %$* 232
living under totalitarian regime was a big disadvantage. %$* 232
of course i’m very happy that my daughters were born in freedom. %$* 232
but, sometimes i really think, that having experience of living in a fear society, i have a big advantage. %$* 232
because, i will never take freedom for granted. %$* 232
i will never think that the grass on the other side could be greener. %$* 232
i will never say what was said by one human rights, so-called human rights officer of the united nations two years ago in baghdad, when he was explaining why under saddam hussein it was better. %$* 232
he said, you know, under saddam, if only you object, give away your freedom of thought and expression, you’re physically more or less okay. %$* 232
now only the one who never had to give away his freedom of thought and expression can say such a thing. %$* 232
people who live in fear societies, have different perspective, of the advantages of democracy. %$* 232
and when they say democracy, exactly as all the colleagues who are against said, democracy’s not about elections. %$* 232
stalin had elections. %$* 232
he did pretty well there. %$* 232
and hitler not only had elections but as just now was said, he has opposition. %$* 232
he was elected democratically, but nobody would think that third reich is %$* 232
a democracy. %$* 232
america’s strong democracy because, it has all these institutions of civil society, free press, independent courts, and so forth. %$* 232
because %$* 232
when i—when i’m speaking about democracy  %$* 232
the society which as i call, can pass the town square test-- %$* 232
you can come to the center of your city. %$* 232
you can speak your mind, you can express your opinions, and you won’t be punished, you will not be harassed. %$* 232
that’s free society. %$* 232
so, is promoting free institutions of free society, like, free press, or, or independent opposition, independent courts, is promotion of these institutions result us a better year? %$* 232
of course not. %$* 232
what, that’s, exactly what america was doing, when you defeated germany, and japan in the second world war. %$* 232
you spent enormous efforts, economical, intellectual, financial, to support, to promote democracy, and today japan and germany is not a threat. %$* 232
take russia, when russia was part of the totalitarian soviet system, it was your worst enemy. %$* 232
when soviet union fell apart and russia went towards freedom, it almost became your ally. %$* 232
today, when freedom is then in retreat, in a big retreat, it becomes again a threat to america. %$* 232
and that is true about every part of the world. %$* 232
take venezuela, you take north korea, you take iran %$* 232
what—whenever there is a threat to america is means that democracy is there, in retreat. %$* 232
if middle east today is a dangerous place, it’s not because of democracy. %$* 232
it’s because in the last 60 years, when democracy was spread to germany, and to japan, and to spain, and to latin america, and to south asia, and to eastern europe, and even to russia, it was never spread to middle east. %$* 232

tolerant and inclusive, moderate than extreme and above all, non-judgmental. %$* 595
these are not simple social science abstractions. %$* 595
if you don't believe me, look at the terry schiavo affair. %$* 595
strident voices in the republican base said go for it. %$* 595
the republican congressional leaders went for it. %$* 595
president bush even flew back from crawford, interrupting for one of the few times in his presidency a vacation. %$* 595
and then what happened? %$* 595
these folks were stunned to find that they had a genuine public revolt on their hands. %$* 595
including a revolt of a majority of religious americans who considered what the government was doing meddling and intrusive, a violation of family privacy and abuse of law to limit our personal freedoms. %$* 595
and so my friends, to sum up, religious americans have been at the forefront of progressive change throughout our history. %$* 595
they strengthen our society and our politics today and they do not strengthen – they do not threaten, indeed they reinforce our tradition of liberty. %$* 595
one - %$* 595
now, if you've followed me on this journey i'll hope, i hope you'll agree that just as george bailey in normal, ennobled bedford falls – so religious americans with all their flaws have ennobled our country. %$* 595
but my guess is that many of you remain unconvinced. %$* 595
what about the shrill voices, the calls for a christian america? %$* 595
jerry falwell's lunatic rantings? %$* 595
well of this and more is true. %$* 595
but every movement, secular and religious has its extremists. %$* 595
those with tunnel vision and an absolute conviction of their own rectitude who will brook no compromise. %$* 595
let me ask you – who among you would wish to be judged in accordance with the most extreme version of the faith or beliefs you profess? %$* 595
to judge fairly you must look at the full picture, not the fringe. %$* 595
and if you do, i'm confident that you will conclude that america is not too damm religious after all. %$* 595
thank you very much william galston. %$* 589
we've now completed the first portion of the evening's debate. %$* 589
and at this point i'd like to announce the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 589
before the debate sixty seven point forty six percent of you – i like that uh second decimal uh refinement there – sixty seven point forty six percent of you voted for the motion. %$* 589
uh twenty four point four oh percent of you voted against the motion. %$* 589
and eight point one four percent of you were in the category of don't know. %$* 589
we're now ready to begin the question and answer portion of this evening's debate. %$* 589
i will call on the questioners. %$* 589
someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone. %$* 589
please stand when you ask your question. %$* 589
i would ask that first you do not start to ask your question until you have the microphone. %$* 589
secondly and obviously importantly uh please make your questions short and to the point. %$* 589
if any questions come from members of the press, they should identify themselves as such. %$* 589
and finally members of the audience have the option to identify themselves or such – or not if they, depending on which they choose to do. %$* 589
so if we could have a first question. %$* 589
thank you – am i – the one – i'm sorry they gave me the mic so i thought i was %$* 589
i can't see – over here yes. %$* 179
thank you. %$* 179
thank you all the panelists for your excellent talks. %$* 179
my name is jerry orstrom. %$* 179
i'd like to ask the panelists opposed the motion uh their views on the teaching of intelligent design in the schools as an alternative to evolution. %$* 179
uh would any of the panelists volunteer to do that or shall i toss the question at one or the other of you or toss it over to the other folks to answer for the panelists who are against. %$* 589
well i speak as the son of the sterling professor of biology emeritus at yale university. %$* 595
uh so i think you can probably guess what i believe about the matter at hand. %$* 595
uh having said that uh john stewart mills said something that stuck with me ever, ever since the first time i read it as an undergraduate. %$* 595
he who knows only his own side of the case doesn't even know that. %$* 595
uh and i am i am fascin – i was fascinated to read a review of a biography of, of the uh you know the english botanist, alfred russel wallace. %$* 595
you know who was a contemporary of darwin and some believe anticipated him and how wallace struggled with the question of the relationship between evolution and design. %$* 595
you know what, i think our students might be better off if they knew something about that controversy. %$* 595
i'm not saying i'm in favor of the kinds of curricula that the extremists are pushing but if you're asking me in principle, would it be good for our students to know that there is a history of debate on these issue, this issue, and people who are by no means manifestly foolish have taken various points of view. %$* 595
no i don't think they would be worse off. %$* 595
uh barry lynn did you want to respond to that. %$* 589
um bill i think this is a good example of what we're talking about tonight. %$* 590
the truth is that in two major recent studies, high school biology teachers said that they spent quote little or no time discussing evolution. %$* 590
why do they do that? %$* 590
because they are afraid of stirring up community distaste for what they're doing in those public schools. %$* 590
so in a world, in some other alternate universe where we would have the time to spend enormous amounts of time talking about evolution and then perhaps discussing this controversy, you might be making a very important point. %$* 590
but we are now facing a dumbing down of science so terrible in this country that biology teachers, without any statutes or passage of any goofy resolutions from school boards, are simply afraid to teach the truth. %$* 590
the scientific truth as they know it to be true. %$* 590
they don't doubt it but they're afraid to teach it. %$* 590
and that's the climate of religious intolerance. %$* 590
of religious efforts to move city councils, state legislatures, state boards of educations in the direction of biblical literalism instead of scientific truth. %$* 590
without even understanding that there's a difference between the two disciplines. %$* 590
that's the real world that susan was talking about. %$* 590
that's what we find when we litigate these cases as we did with the aclu of pennsylvania up in dover, pennsylvania. %$* 590
i have to say i'm a little tired of this real world, illusory world distinction. %$* 591
um as those of us over here somehow living in um i think you said an alternative universe where in fact certain kinds of discussions can go forward. %$* 591
and and be had and it's to the benefit of everyone. %$* 591
that's simply not the case. %$* 591
i think that we understand very well the kinds of pressures that can be brought to bear given the way america has organized its schools we've never had total monolithic control of the schools. %$* 591
we have school districts with a lot of independence. %$* 591
that means you're going to get variety from place to place. %$* 591
if this process of dumbing down were as systematic as mr. %$* 591
lynn suggests it makes our continuing astonishing uh sort of scientific progress and the fact that people come from all over the world to study science here, a bit perplexing. %$* 591
uh now having said that let me just indicate that if you look at the kinds of text books that are used, which i did but maybe i was doing that in an alternate universe that are used to teach science in our high schools and are the most widely adopted text books, you see that evolution in fact is covered and that it is something that is addressed. %$* 591
but it is also important not to become, it seems to me, if we're worried about fundamentalism uh there is a kind of darwinian fundamentalism that in fact will brook no debate and no opposition. %$* 591
and the truth of the matter is, if you know anything about this field at all is that there's a tremendous amount of debate internal to it. %$* 591
and a lot of, and scientists who are uh see themselves as evolutionists who strenuously reject darwin's classical theory and so forth. %$* 591
so i think students can handle these kinds of debates, both within science and between the scientists and those with an alternate account. %$* 591
although i should say that a lot of the intelligent design people including a very distinguished scientist named sir john polkinghorne do support some notion of intelligent design. %$* 591
so it's not just a bunch of whackos out there who want to dumb everything down, who think this debate should go forward. %$* 591
well we'll have al and then susan. %$* 589
ok this is tangential as i think most of my comments are tonight to some of the debate but if we're talking about the real world i think what really concerns me is not whether the, this debate about intelligent design and darwinism, that has some importance, what concerns me is the corporate presence in our schools in which students are eating pizza from pizza hut and coca cola from the coca cola company. %$* 593
the rampant disease of consumerism. %$* 593
that is showing its way in terms of unprecedented numbers of child obesity in our society. %$* 593
in the real world what bothers me is that the average american child, whatever they study in terms of issues of darwinism or intelligent design watches three and a half hours of television a night. %$* 593
the average american adult watches five hours of television a day. %$* 593
talk about dumbing down - that's where it comes from. %$* 591
that's twenty one thousand commercials a year. %$* 592
i'm gonna have to ask our, our debaters to be a little bit briefer in their responses so we can get to some more questions. %$* 589
but first of all susan. %$* 589
yes i would just like to say that dr. %$* 594
elshtain's comment is typical of this kind of argument. %$* 594
she is suggesting that there is actually debate about evolution versus intelligent design. %$* 594
there is of course much debate within the scientific community about many of the particulars of evolution. %$* 594
there is no debate at all in the scientific community about intelligent design on the one hand versus evolution on the other. %$* 594
furthermore, uh, what dr. %$* 594
galston said, certainly intelligent design would be an interesting thing to have in a college course on, on the history of pseudo- science and religion, that would be good. %$* 594
but to include it in a high school biology class would be to include for example, the theory of that—the theory of that vortices were responsible, vertexes were responsible for the earth turning on its axis. %$* 594
that is not a debate, it’s putting nonsense in the same classroom with science, period. %$* 594
could—could i have a question from this side of the auditorium, please? %$* 589
yeah, hi, thank you very much, howard baruch, i’m curious why the biggest threat, uh, to us as a society in this country, that even gives us the ability to have this conversation, wasn’t touched on by either side of the panel. %$* 179
uh, where right now in the middle east we have people who wanna fly into our country and destroy our country but, you know, but nobody brought this up as a threat to our way of society, on both sides of the panel. %$* 179
and, just seemed to be neglected. %$* 179
thank you. %$* 589
uh, we’ll, we’ll have a brief comment on that, the— the motion was america is, is too damn religious, i think that probably accounts for some of the direction of that. %$* 589
but if anybody would like to make a brief response to that, uh, point obviously on people’s minds. %$* 589
we’ll take another question then. %$* 589
oh, thank you. %$* 178
my name is susan harrington, and what i’m a little bit concerned about this evening is that the question for me is not is—are americans too religious, that’s of, really of no interest to me. %$* 178
more important to me is is the american government too religious. %$* 178
are the american schools too religious. %$* 178
is the american medical society too religious or affected by religion. %$* 178
panelists? %$* 589
barry lynn? %$* 589
i—i think, uh, susan was, uh, addressing that issue as, as alan and i were also that in %$* 590
our—that our concern is the way in which religion has played off government and played off politics in these negative ways. %$* 590
susan, don’t, don’t tell all of your free- thinker friends that i’m gonna say this but the fact that franklin delano roosevelt said a prayer on d-day over the radio, i’m not too troubled about. %$* 590
what i am troubled about is george w.bush seems to have a prayer for every day from a-day to z-day and he’s happy to share it with us at all times. %$* 590
his ideology, shared by many of those third of americans who are biblical literalists, has a tremendous negative effect on the way we can do science, the very things we can study in medicine and science, so while some are coming to america to study, you’re right, jean, it’s also true that because of our absurd policies for example on stem-cell research, we are losing some of the top scientists in this country, east and west, to other nations. %$* 590
does anyone—bill? %$* 589
i really have to protest. %$* 595
uh— with— with a smile. %$* 595
uh, one of the pieces, one of the pieces of my biography, uh, is that i was in the clinton white house for two and a half years as his deputy, uh, deputy director for domestic policy. %$* 595
uh, i have gone down with the good ship al gore, twice. %$* 595
uh, this—you know %$* 595
uh, i did not come here, i thought, for a debate about george bush and the bush administration. %$* 595
uh— i %$* 595
you know %$* 595
i yield, i really do yield to no one in my opposition to this administration. %$* 595
but, to reason from the follies and excesses of this administration to conclusions about america, just strikes me as a syllogism with a missing middle— %$* 595
well, may—may i just— %$* 592
and as well— i think it was— and as a well— let me %$* 591
let me just— %$* 591
the mod—the moderator will take charge. %$* 589
bill, are you finished with your remarks, ‘cause i’d like alan, who made the distinction between americans and america, uh, respond, uh, if, if that’s all right and we’ll, we’ll carry on— %$* 589
i think i’ve made my point. %$* 595
um, i’m a great admirer of all your work with al gore and bill clinton but, look, i’m the one who brought george w. bush into this debate, and, and, how could you not? %$* 592
uh, on, on, on this particular subject, it’s, it’s, we have seen, in the last six years, uh, a, a, really a—a radical transformation, in the, in my opinion the manipulation of a, political-religious, pseudo-religious movement, uh, to serve secular ends, but to cover— i believe to serve secular political ends, but to cover it with religious language. %$* 592
because, it is widely understood in this country given its religiosity, that it’s perfectly appropriate to argue about politics, but it’s not appropriate to argue about religion, as susan jacoby said. %$* 592
once you say you’re religious then we’re all supposed to say, oh, i didn’t know, my goodness, of course i respect everything you say. %$* 592
it is, it seems to me, a violation of both the principles of liberal democratic debate, but even more importantly a violation of the fundamental christian idea of rendering under caesar what is caesar’s, and rendering to god what is god’s. %$* 592
for politicians, george w.bush and the republican party to try to, uh, impose undemocratically a radical agenda on the united states, bad enough. %$* 592
and then to cover it in religious language as a way of immunizing themselves from criticism because we all know that this is a particularly thin- skinned administration that doesn’t want the public to question what it does and what a better way to do that than to say, or to claim, that when people disagree with them, that’s religious bigotry, that’s religious prejudice and so on and so on. %$* 592
and that’s why— %$* 592
you know, alan, alan was— %$* 589
—george w. bush is the— %$* 592
there—there—there was a, there was a panel— it was—there was a panel a couple of years ago at the annual meeting of the american academy of religion, about 7000 people show up to this thing. %$* 591
and if memory serves, i think peter steinfels was on that panel. %$* 591
um, and it had to do with looking at the, uh, religious, explicit religious references and so on in the— or at least one person did—in the, in the speeches of president clinton, and george bush. %$* 591
uh, or george bush specifically and someone compared it to clinton and it turned out, uh, that it was— that bill clinton referenced scripture more frequently than bush did. %$* 591
which proves my point— %$* 592
and, and, and with—and as bill galston likes to say, it’s because he knows it better. %$* 591
um— but at any rate it’s— the no—the notion %$* 591
the notion that, the notion that you know, if we—i mean the, the political agenda that seems to be going on is because one opposes certain policies, one therefore has to oppose, uh, the fact that those promulgating these policies, uh, have strong religious beliefs. %$* 591
but when you—but if you favor the policies, uh, then presumably, the religious references, the use of scripture and so on, is something to, to good ends, and i think that, uh, if we wanna blame, uh, barry lynn mentioned the faith-based initiative, i think, uh, the person responsible’s right here. %$* 591
i mean this was a—this was a clinton administration initiative. %$* 591
so i think there’s a lot of, of, of strange, uh %$* 591
there’s a lot of history being rewritten here about how these things wok. %$* 591
and i also think, alan, you’re not—and i, then i know i’ve gotta stop here. %$* 591
you’re not giving the american people enough credit to sort out the use and abuse of religion in the public sphere. %$* 591
i mean if indeed the bush administration were so diabolically clever as you seem to claim it is, why aren’t his, why aren’t his ratings at up at 80 percent? %$* 591
uh, his approval ratings, people have a capacity to think critically about this, give people some credit. %$* 591
uh—i—peter—oh. %$* 594
one question. %$* 589
uh, be brief, please— %$* 589
uh, i’ll—yeah, i’ll, i’ll—well i will, i’ll, i’ll forget what—i’ll, i’ll stop what i was going to say which is this is not a debate about biblical references, i love it when people use biblical references. %$* 594
it’s like, like barry, i don’t love it when it’s an obligation to con— con—finish every speech with “god bless america.” but the reason george bush’s ratings are down, is because you can’t keep the reality-based world away forever. %$* 594
this is—just call this the revenge of the reality-based world. %$* 594
i—i—i’d like to, i’d like to throw in a question myself because, uh, despite the sparks we’ve seen, uh, in recent moments, uh, i detected a distressing amount of agreement underlying, many of the debaters’ presentations tonight. %$* 589
uh, namely there’s agreement about all kinds of bad forms of religion, there certainly were not endorsements of certain kinds of use of government and legislative fiat, uh, for religious purposes. %$* 589
but i’m still not certain about the question, which in some ways bill galston posed. %$* 589
uh, if the price %$* 589
of getting rid of the forms of religion that bothers us or the use of religion in conjunction with state power, or the means of getting rid of that, were to make americans somehow or other less religious generally, pray less, read scripture less, light sabbath candles less, pay less attention to their religious leaders, is that the price that we think would be worth paying, and i thought susan answered that to some extent directly in her remarks ‘cause, maybe i’m wrong, she seemed to think that that would be one way of doing it especially in regard to that one third of the country. %$* 589
no— %$* 594
but i don’t have other people—i’d like to have other people’s responses— %$* 589
but i’d like to—i, i didn’t say—first of all i think that’s— okay— %$* 594
—that’s a false choice. %$* 594
i don’t think that the—i don’t think that the price we pay in, in not letting government be as involved with religion as it is in making americans less religious at all. %$* 594
uh, in fact, if you look at europe, alan mentioned europe, and, and i don’t entirely agree with him about this. %$* 594
in europe there is in fact much more official church-state entanglement than there has been here, all—all along. %$* 594
and yet europe is indeed much more secular than it is here and probably that is the reason. %$* 594
so i cannot imagine why anyone would think that whatever we do about church and state will make americans personally less religious. %$* 594
yeah, and, i—i thought it was interesting, important to— %$* 592
and i don’t—not that i, not that i care, i think less religion would be better altogether. %$* 594
well, we, we— %$* 594
but i don’t see why it would affect, why it would affect americans’ personal religion. %$* 594
i—i was sure this issue would arise, and that’s why i wanted to be on this side to point out to the audience that, we on this side can disagree with each other, on the question of whether americans are too damn religious, and still completely agree on the question of whether america is too damn religious. %$* 592
that distinction just strikes me as enormously important, i am not sam harris, i am not richard dawkins, i am not—i do not object to religion. %$* 592
i object to public religion, the use and deliberate manipulation of religion. %$* 592
that it seems to me is the problem, so peter, my answer to your question is, we’re not here to address the question you raised. %$* 592
the question of whether americans are not religious enough or too re—is just not simply on the table. %$* 592
it’s not what we’re about. %$* 592
you wanna have richard dawkins debate john polkinghorne or something like that, then have that debate. %$* 592
but that’s not our debate. %$* 592
um, alan, public religion, um, refers not just to the people that you don’t like misusing religion as you understand it. %$* 591
it refers quite specifically to the kinds of movements and efforts that our side has identified. %$* 591
that precisely involves bringing religion into the public square as a form of public religion. %$* 591
i think that your understanding of religion, is, is of a kind of quiet, contemplative sort where it’s all about, uh, it’s all about my own, uh, orientation. %$* 591
but as we all know, historically, uh, various religious traditions have strong histories of different forms of social engagement. %$* 591
the question is what does that engagement look like, what does it involve? %$* 591
and none of the folks that we talked about, none of the efforts we talked about, called for anything like, uh, establishing a faith, anything like something like quasi- establishment, but certainly believe that there had to be this strong public witness and public presence. %$* 591
and i think that’s, that’s part of what—that’s why i said we’re awfully damn american, that’s what america historically has very much been about, and it’s one of the fruits %$* 591
and here i think might be the one point where i agree with susan. %$* 591
the fruits of free exercise. %$* 591
you precisely have the kind of hollowing-out of the religious traditions in europe because of that history of church- state, which i think destroys religion over a long time when you’ve got established religion. %$* 591
we don’t have that, we’ve never have that. %$* 591
but we have people who want it. %$* 592
that’s the point— %$* 592
no, no we don’t— %$* 591
—i couldn’t agree with you more that— %$* 592
they don’t want a—they don’t want an established religion, they have too strong a stake in free exercise— uh, could i— bill, bill— %$* 591
no, the free exercise for the majority— %$* 592
well, here’s—here’s what we’re going to do at this point. %$* 589
i would like actually to take a few more questions without getting responses, simply to get the questions, and if panelists would like to respond to one or another of them, that would be fine. %$* 589
there’s a question, i—i encourage people to sit in the first row so there’s a question right here, there’s a woman right here, uh, who’s eager to ask a question. %$* 589
and then we’ll move back to that one and then over here, let’s take, uh, three questions quickly %$* 589
and please be brief with your questions too. %$* 589
audience member (female) my name is inga gittelman and i have just one question. %$* 589
how do you define religious. %$* 589
you all seem to see something else. %$* 589
and in the end you’re all the same. %$* 589
thank you. %$* 589
question was, uh, that, that the definition of religion was at the, perhaps at the center of this, this debate. %$* 589
hello, can i, uh, can i just— %$* 179
quest—what’s— %$* 589
i’ve had, i’ve had this for a while, peter— all right. %$* 179
hi, uh, i’m professor marufi i’m also from fordham university. %$* 179
and i—i have a question, i think, one of the things that bothered me a little bit about this discussion, is that religion in my mind is a variable, it’s not a constant. %$* 179
so it’s very hard to answer this question. %$* 179
but the—what that leads me to believe, is that, the extent to which people use religion to underwrite ethics and morality, has an implication for public policy. %$* 179
so my question to you is, to what extent does the majority have the right, because of their religious beliefs, to dictate morality, conscience, and ethics, to people who don’t share those beliefs who might be in a minority. %$* 179
good, thank you, and one more. %$* 589
uh, christopher rizzari my question in this debate has always been, where are the main-line churches in this debate, i think if you were to go to the midwest, or even new jersey, the most visible churches that you would see are the big mega-corporate churches. %$* 179
where are—where’s the 150-year-old episcopalian churches that have had white members who were involved in abolition and the civil rights movement, where are those churches in this debate. %$* 179
thank you very much, i hope that in their remarks, uh, some of the—their closing remarks, some of the debaters may in fact, uh, take up some of those very good, uh, cle—questions that i’m glad we got on the floor and i’d particularly like to thank all the audience for making your questions brief. %$* 589
it’s now time, uh, to vote. %$* 589
uh, here’s the ticket if you want to vote for the motion %$* 589
you tear off the “for” from the top and slip it into the ballot boxes. %$* 589
if you are against the motion tear off and deposit the “against” and if you still don’t know where you stand just put the entire ticket in the box. %$* 589
the ballot boxes will be given to one person %$* 589
at the end of the row and passed along, please pass them quickly to your neighbor %$* 589
and one of the ushers will then take the box and pass it on to the row behind you. %$* 589
everyone should get a chance to vote %$* 589
please don’t reach over, wait till the ballot box gets to yourself. %$* 589
uh, now, if we could do the rest of the voting, uh, quietly, if we could, if we could proceed a little bit more quietly i’d like to start with the final remarks from the panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion. %$* 589
and i’d ask the panelists to please speak, uh, from their places. %$* 589
so first, speaking against the motion, jean bethke elshtain. %$* 589
uh, well, as we have learned this evening, uh, the interaction of religion and politics, is a continuing tension. %$* 591
it’s a dramatic story. %$* 591
uh, we have our version of it, and you’ve heard a bit of that version from our side. %$* 591
uh, we’ve heard some, some rather dismissive remarks and some ridicule from the other side. %$* 591
uh, but i would ask you to reflect on the question of american civil society, uh, as you go forward into this evening. %$* 591
uh, the fact that religious commitment, citizens who are believers, believers who are citizens, have been the backbone and the heart of american civil society historically, that we would be enormously impoverished without their commitment, in almost every area of social life. %$* 591
now, the notion that somehow, when people bring their religious commitments to the public arena that means they’re trying to “dictate” their faith to the rest of us. %$* 591
no, they’re doing what citizens do. %$* 591
they’re trying to persuade you of something. %$* 591
uh, they’re trying to get you to think about things a certain way, they’re trying to get you to vote a certain way. %$* 591
that’s what citizens do. %$* 591
and we should not impose some kind of penalty on those with religious convictions when they bring those convictions into public life. %$* 591
now one other important point here and that is, that religion helps to provide the kind of critical self- limitation that keeps a political system from dangerous overreach. %$* 591
um, that is to say, it helps to remind us ongoingly, of the dangers of a certain kind of political power, and the attempts to take over all areas of social life by saying no, wait a minute. %$* 591
uh, we have free exercise in this country, certain things cannot be dictated to us, and certain kinds of controls cannot be applied, and that’s part of the american story too. %$* 591
thank you very much, jean elshtain. %$* 589
now, uh, with some closing remarks, uh, for the motion, barry lynn. %$* 589
uh, i have not given a speech in the last 20 years without mentioning one person’s name, so i’ll mention it now. %$* 590
uh, on saturday i’m going down to pat robertson’s regent university law school to judge the finals of their moot court competition. %$* 590
so even he and i do chat on occasion. %$* 590
and i am never saying, that people like pat robertson, james dobson, jerry falwell do not have a right to speak, do not have a right to go to the public forum, in which they find, uh, their voices heard. %$* 590
i’m just saying that if you speak so unpersuasively that you don’t %$* 590
persuade people to do what you want them to do, then don’t you dare go to the government and try to get the government to force all of us to live as you would have us. %$* 590
and second, uh, and final point here, it goes to a question that was not addressed, yes, terrorists came to america. %$* 590
and we should at some point debate fundamentalism around the world. %$* 590
the truth in the matter in this real world, in every world, in this universe, is that when pope—the late pope john paul ii condemned the invasion of iraq in the strongest possible words used by any modern pope, and said that the american officials who made the decision to invade iraq would have to answer directly to god, george bush’s response was to call in a group of so-called religious right theologians two days later to come to the white house, chat with him, and explain to the press afterwards that they were convinced that this was a just war. %$* 590
i believe that if president george bush had in fact done a little more intelligence-gathering, and a little less theological butt-protecting, there would be thousands of american families and tens of thousands of iraqi families who would not be visiting their children in graveyards. %$* 590
it does matter. %$* 590
thank you, thank you very much, barry lynn. %$* 589
and now speaking against tonight’s motion, albert raboteau. %$* 589
as i hinted earlier, well, let me, let me do something first, i— i’d like to express my appreciation to the rosenberg foundation and its executive director, robert rosenberg, for this occasion. %$* 593
and i’d like to— %$* 593
rosenkranz. %$* 591
rosenkranz. %$* 591
i’m sorry %$* 593
rosen—rosenkranz. %$* 589
rosenkranz, i’m sorry, yeah. %$* 593
can’t read my own writing. %$* 593
uh, thanks also to dana wolfe for inviting me to participate in this debate and to vern calhoun and kris kamikawa for the arrangements which they handled so graciously. %$* 593
i’d like to also thank my fellow panelists for their thoughtful and cogent arguments. %$* 593
as i said earlier i—i feel somewhat tangential to this argument, in part because the argument was about religion, or church and state, religion and political culture. %$* 593
the way in which i took the question—and this partly gets at the question of what is religion— was, what’s the role of religion in terms of the american ethos the spirit of the american people. %$* 593
uh, as we all know jefferson changed locke’s notion of the inalienable rights from life, liberty and property, to life, liberty, and the pursuit of freedom—of happiness, excuse me, pursuit of happiness. %$* 593
what i see as being part of the ethos of american culture, uh, and the american, direction, has been a reversal of that, those inalienable rights. %$* 593
that is we are back to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. %$* 593
property in terms of rampant consumerism which is what i see as the real danger to american culture and spirit today. %$* 593
now let me close with, um, with three short stories, brief vignettes, which have to do i think with the possibility of religion consum—continually renewing itself and reminding people who are religious or who hear, uh, in some ways religious symbols, who aren’t totally tone-deaf to religion. %$* 593
al—al, your, your two minutes is up, if you can make the stories very quick— %$* 589
okay, i’ll make them, i’ll make them very, very, very short, i’ll make, make it only two. %$* 593
uh, the first one has to do with, with abba abba serapian, uh, one day was, walking down the road. %$* 593
it’s in the fourth or fifth century. %$* 593
and, um, he gives his cloak to a poor man. %$* 593
and as he walks on he meets another poor man who’s shivering in the cold and gives him his tunic. %$* 593
and then he sat down naked holding the holy gospel. %$* 593
someone came along and asked him, abba, who has taken your clothes. %$* 593
and he pointed to the gospel book and said, this is the robber. %$* 593
the last quick story, one day abba lott went to see abba joseph and said to him, abba, as much as i am i, uh, i am unable, i practice a small rule, a little fasting, some prayer and meditation and remain quiet and as much as possible guard my thoughts. %$* 593
what else should i do. %$* 593
then the old man stood up and stretched his hands towards heaven. %$* 593
his fingers became like ten torches of flame, and he said to him, if you wish, you can become all flame. %$* 593
now i present those to you as two zen-like koans for your reflection about the abilities of religion to %$* 593
renew itself, to see beyond itself, and to point to something important for the human spirit. %$* 593
rosenkranz, i’m sorry, yeah. %$* 593
can’t read my own writing. %$* 593
uh, thanks also to dana wolfe for inviting me to participate in this debate and to vern calhoun and kris kamikawa for the arrangements which they handled so graciously. %$* 593
i’d like to also thank my fellow panelists for their thoughtful and cogent arguments. %$* 593

what i see as being part of the ethos of american culture, uh, and the american, direction, has been a reversal of that, those inalienable rights. %$* 593
that is we are back to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. %$* 593
property in terms of rampant consumerism which is what i see as the real danger to american culture and spirit today. %$* 593
now let me close with, um, with three short stories, brief vignettes, which have to do i think with the possibility of religion consum—continually renewing itself and reminding people who are religious or who hear, uh, in some ways religious symbols, who aren’t totally tone-deaf to religion. %$* 593
i’m sorry %$* 593
as i hinted earlier, well, let me, let me do something first, i— i’d like to express my appreciation to the rosenberg foundation and its executive director, robert rosenberg, for this occasion. %$* 593
and i’d like to— %$* 593
thank you, al raboteau. %$* 589
and now, uh, speaking in support of the motion, uh, susan jacoby. %$* 589
it’s been suggested that religion creates a check against government overreaching. %$* 594
we wish. %$* 594
more often than not, it pro— can also provide an excuse for government overreaching. %$* 594
for overreaching in general in fact. %$* 594
we’ve heard a great deal in recent months about how the only strategy for liberal democratic candidates is to fight fire with fire, by pitting liberal religious values against the dominant conservative values of the current administration. %$* 594
i knew that hillary clinton was running for president two years ago, when for the first— when the first time she said, “our bible,” in those pious, sanctimonious tones. %$* 594
“our bible tells us this.” the problem with this is that your bible may tell you something else altogether, as indeed was the case with the pope on one side and the various minister hacks bush got together on the other. %$* 594
what is the bible telling— what, telling those very religious senators now, as they fiddle and manage not to debate while iraq burns. %$* 594
i for one would like to hear a lot less about theology and a lot more about the personal moral courage that has seemed so lacking in our political process. %$* 594
uh, whoever the gentlemen said, i—i do not believe we have to have a civic morality that while for many includes religion, has to be based on more than religion. %$* 594
too often, referencing religion has become not a way to demonstrate personal responsibility, but a way to avoid it. %$* 594
and one final thing, it’s a wonderful life is a movie. %$* 594
thank %$* 589
thank you, susan jacoby. %$* 589
uh, we’ll now have finally speaking against the motion, william galston. %$* 589
it may be a movie, but it’s a little closer to reality than many of the things that team a has presented us with this evening. %$* 595
uh— hear, hear. %$* 595
i, uh %$* 595
i certainly, uh, you know %$* 595
i, i certainly believe, uh, that there are dogmatic biblical literalists, no question about it. %$* 595
i also believe, i think with good factual warrant, that there are dogmatic atheists. %$* 595
quite frankly i don’t see anything to choose between them. %$* 595
in my presentation, i offered three arguments about the historical contribution of religion, about the current social and political engagement of religious americans, uh, and third about religious americans as not being a threat to our liberties. %$* 595
about the first of these propositions, apparently there’s no contest. %$* 595
uh, about the second, apparently no contest, or at least we, we heard none. %$* 595
and as for the third, the only evidence that was put on the table, was a parade of horribles which as professor elshtain has pointed out, have been rejected by the american people themselves. %$* 595
the terry schiavo affair is a perfect case in point. %$* 595
a question arose, from the audience, about the rule of—the rule and role of law. %$* 595
uh, i would remind everyone, that martin luther king was not simply appealing to conscience. %$* 595
he was advocating for law. %$* 595
in his judgment, conscience led to law, so the real issue is not law and coercion yay or nay, but rather the legitimate limits of law and coercion. %$* 595
i’m a professor of political philosophy, i’d be happy to debate that with you for hours on end, but that is the question. %$* 595
finally, uh %$* 595
reverend lynn referred to thomas jefferson, this is my peroration, peter. %$* 595
uh, and, quite appropriately. %$* 595
uh, he was one of our, uh, i would say least orthodox founders. %$* 595
uh, and we rightly honor him for his, uh, intellectual courage. %$* 595
so let me close with this quotation, from thomas jefferson. %$* 595
“can the liberties of a nation be thought secure, when we have removed their only firm basis—a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of god.” thank you very much. %$* 595
thank you, william galston, and now finally, uh, speaking for the motion, alan wolfe. %$* 589
well, we obviously have our disagreements on this panel, we obviously have our disagreements in america, we’re deeply divided on some of these questions. %$* 592
but when we’re attacked, when our enemies launch an attack against us, we come together, and we unite, and we rely on our armed forces to defend us as a people. %$* 592
at the air force academy in colorado springs, colorado, a publicly-financed institution, designed to defend all americans against their enemies, has been taken over by evangelical christians who use every facility at the air force academy in their capacity to proselytize for jesus christ. %$* 592
lawsuits have been brought, inquiries have been brought, the practices continue. %$* 592
this is the danger of america being too religious. %$* 592
this is not permissible in our pluralistic, democratic society. %$* 592
jean elshtain says, that what religious believers want is the right to free exercise. %$* 592
for a certain kind of religious believer, the right to free exercise is the right to proselytize, and the right to free exercise is to proselytize in public at public institutions. %$* 592
our first amendment forbids the establishment of, of a state church, and protects the right to religious freedom. %$* 592
but for a certain kind of religious believer in this country, the right to exercise their freedom is constituted by the right to establish themselves as the official church in their local community, in their university, or in their public institution. %$* 592
those are the dangers, it seems to me. %$* 592
this requires that we be extremely sensitive to paradox, that we walk fine lines. %$* 592
of course we want people who are motivated by matters of conscience and by matters of faith, to make public their concerns. %$* 592
of course, at least i believe, our entire political culture is enriched by the private consciences and the religious convictions of americans, i knew that on my side of the panel, there would be people who would be probably somewhat less sympathetic to people of faith than i would be. %$* 592
but i wanted to use my opportunity to demonstrate, that when america becomes too damn religious, it’s bad for religion. %$* 592
it’s bad for people of faith. %$* 592
it is bad when people use faith for what are corrupt, unreligious, and for christians, un-christian ends, and i hope i’ve been able to persuade you of that. %$* 592
thank you very much, alan. %$* 589
uh, i would in fact like to thank all the debaters, and the audience for their very good work this evening. %$* 589
i think we could give them another round of enthusiastic applause. %$* 589
before announcing the results of the audience vote, i want to take care of a few other matters. %$* 589
first, the next intelligence squared us debate will take place on wednesday, march 14th, 2007, here at asia society and museum. %$* 589
the motion to be debated is, “global warming is not a crisis.” i’m not signing up on that one. %$* 589
the remaining three debates in our spring series, including that one, are all sold out. %$* 589
the good news is however that beginning next week, uh, intelligence squared us will start selling packages on-line and by phone for the fall 2007-spring 2008 series. %$* 589
we will be giving priority to full-season subscribers, so to avoid disappointment, you should buy those series packages immediately. %$* 589
in addition, tonight’s debate can be heard locally on wnyc-am 820, on friday, february 23rd, at 2 p.m. %$* 589
copies of some of our panelists’ books are for sale upstairs in the lobby. %$* 589
you can also purchase dvd’s from previous debates, here tonight or from the intelligence squared us website. %$* 589
finally, please be sure to pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of the times of london, and the times literary supplement, as you leave the auditorium. %$* 589
and, uh, now i take— there’s not an envelope to tear open but the results of our debate, um %$* 589
there seems to have been a slight swing from the “don’t knows” to the “for the motion.” uh, after our debaters did their best to persuade you, you voted, 70.35 percent for the motion, and 24.34 percent against the motion, and only 5.31 percent now in the “don’t know” category. %$* 589
so, congratulations to all the debaters but especially for those supporting the motion. %$* 589
thank you very much. %$* 589

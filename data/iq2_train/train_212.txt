rather than just the meaning of clean energy, i’d like to ask the question about the meaning of economic recovery. %$* 18
given that until just now, nobody had the sort of the wherewithal to bring up climate change because there’s some who will contest the indisputable scientific evidence behind global climate change, i’d like to just ask that if there’s the potential for climate change to derail not only our society but our entire economy in the longer term, in the middle term, in the long term, can we choose to act in any other way but to embrace the precautionary principle and address this problem immediately rather than finding out what happens with clean energy and-- %$* 18
robert bryce, you write directly to this issue in your new book, so why don’t you take that question. %$* 13
well, i’m agnostic on the question of climate change. %$* 554
i’ve read both sides on the co2 that some say it’s catastrophic, others say that it’s not a problem. %$* 554
to me, it’s, okay, if you believe co2 is bad, then what? %$* 554
what is the solution? %$* 554
and i say it clearly has to be natural gas and nuclear, and nuclear in particular because of the power density numbers because you get such incredible amounts of energy from a very small amount of real estate and relatively small amounts of steel and concrete. %$* 554
and those resource inputs are going to be incredibly important going forward. %$* 554
so, you know, were i the king, if i were the energy czar, i’d say let’s go nuclear in a big way because of the obvious benefits. %$* 554
and i think that the people who are, in my view-- %$* 554
if you are anti- carbon dioxide and anti-nuclear, you’re pro-blackout. %$* 554
let me bring in kassia. %$* 13
let me bring in kassia yanosek, and then i’ll come back to you. %$* 13
kassia, can you make this one brief, though? %$* 13
ish, brief-ish. %$* 13
well, the one thing, and i was just going to make one point here which is i actually agree with our opponents here. %$* 553
i do think nuclear and natural gas are part of the solution. %$* 553
what we haven’t spoken about tonight is actually the importance of having efficient, appropriate long-term transparent government policies to get us there. %$* 553
so if we are going to have an economic recovery that’s going to be fueled by clean energy, we’ve got to have the appropriate government policies in place to get us there in the most efficient and the cheapest manner. %$* 553
okay, steven hayward. %$* 13
yeah, the question i was trying to address in my opening remarks-- %$* 552
that it’s one thing to be told that it’s necessary to do this; it’s another thing to be told, as the motion does tonight, that it will make us richer to do so. %$* 552
here is the blunt problem though. %$* 552
the international energy agency a couple years ago put out an assessment and they caught hell for it because what it said was the united states and european countries could disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow, which means their emissions would go to zero, and the growth in emissions of fossil fuel use of the developing world will make up for all of our emissions in about 15 years, which means if you can’t solve the problem globally, it doesn’t matter what we do. %$* 552
that’s why i like to say the problem is so much bigger, whatever your view on the climate question is, you can accept the catastrophic view and, in fact, that makes it so much bigger than all the piddly things we’ve been talking about with waxman-markey or even incremental improvements and efficiency in this country. %$* 552
that’s a sobering answer for you. %$* 552
question down in the front row. %$* 13
i think kassia just hit the core of this resolution and the difference between the two sides perhaps. %$* 18
a government policy, which to me is code for subsidies, which were only obliquely discussed earlier, so if we return to that subject and if indeed clean energy by any definition is technologically achievable, economically achievable, what kind of government policy is necessary, slash subsidy, and why can it not be left to the market? %$* 18
bill ritter. %$* 13
so there are three things that the government policy can include: a public strategy that helps invest in the innovation-- %$* 551
that can be a part of it. %$* 551
and government policy can certainly be helping think about ways that there are financial instruments. %$* 551
and there are instruments apart from subsides that also lead to investment. %$* 551
there’re a variety of things municipal governments can do, state governments can do that are financial mechanisms. %$* 551
and so, if you have the technology and you have the finance in place, then you look at sort of the other policies that might spur the kind of innovation, and that was our experience in colorado, that our renewable energy standard absolutely made a significant difference in jobs coming to the state because there was a market certainty. %$* 551
steven hayward. %$* 13
i don’t know where to begin. %$* 552
i mean, governor, if a 20 percent renewable standard are good, why not 50 percent? %$* 552
well, we went to 30, and we went to 30 with a two percent rate cap. %$* 551
well, why not 50? %$* 552
well, because we couldn’t get the coalition of people that i believe were necessary for us to do it to make a wise policy-- %$* 551
and cause was not a consideration at all? %$* 552
we got to 30 with a two percent rate cap, that’s a pretty good thing to be, the second most aggressive renewable energy standard and to do that with people at the table agreeing that it was possible and achievable. %$* 551
but your utilities are agreeing why? %$* 554
because there was a pass-through cost to their rate payers. %$* 554
that’s the interesting thing about all the subsidies that are being discussed now is that-- %$* 554
i take the questioners point is directly on point here. %$* 554
i’m all for renewable, but why can’t they exist on their own. %$* 554
why do they need my tax dollars? %$* 554
why do they need everyone else’s tax dollars? %$* 554
well, with the rate cap-- %$* 552
i mean, our history of price controls is real successful. %$* 552
yeah, i mean, i went to bat for the natural gas industry when they were going to remove the tax credit for intangible drilling costs. %$* 18
you’ve written about that. %$* 18
so there’s subsides. %$* 18
there are big subsidies out there, but the fact of the matter is we did this with a two percent rate cap and, in fact-- %$* 18
somebody referenced a story that said we’ve had this kind of inflation in our energy costs, a denver post story that went and looked at this, said the biggest increase in cost came from the opening of a new coal plant, not from renewable resources being at 30 percent renewable by 2020. %$* 18
okay, well, fair enough. %$* 554
would you agree then to-- %$* 554
well, that wasn’t mentioned in your-- %$* 551
that’s fair enough, but you didn’t mention it. %$* 551
okay, so would you agree then, fair field, eliminate all subsidies? %$* 554
fair field, no favor? %$* 554
the oil and gas tax preferences amount to $4.4 billion per year. %$* 554
ethanol alone gets $16 billion. %$* 554
i’m not a fan of ethanol. %$* 551
okay, fair enough, but would you support fair field, no favor-- %$* 554
actually, i’ve got a point here i’d like to make. %$* 553
kassia yanosek. %$* 13
and this is a very important question. %$* 553
i think that what we haven’t seen enough of in this country is enough policies that actually pool technologies into the marketplace. %$* 553
we’ve seen a lot push. %$* 553
well you need some of the push because you actually need to be developing the end market so that you have the development of the turbines and the solar panels who actually sell into a big market, but i absolutely think that the pool of technologies is the most important thing that we need to be focusing on. %$* 553
that could be through a carbon price, a tax or just some sort of price on carbon. %$* 553
i think the clean energy standard, and certainly a federal one is certainly a good way to go rather than the patchwork of state policies that make investors, i think, very concerned because we don’t-- %$* 553
we’d like to see a big federal approach so that we have an easier time in putting our money to work. %$* 553
steven hayward, final word for you. %$* 13
yeah, this is the price on carbon question, that comes up a lot. %$* 552
i actually did a paper with a tufts economist a few years ago on what a $15 a ton price on carbon would get you. %$* 552
we thought about a 10 percent reduction in co2 emissions, not a lot, but something. %$* 552
but here’s the problem with the idea of the price on carbon. %$* 552
you know, europe has had a big price on carbon for a long time. %$* 552
they’ve had high fuel taxes for decades as a-- %$* 552
strictly as a revenue measure. %$* 552
it later became an environmental measure. %$* 552
you know, so their equivalent price of gas is as high as $8 a gallon in some countries and their utility rates are much higher than ours and yet even with those high prices you don’t see any breakthrough in green clean energy technologies in europe. %$* 552
their numbers are about the same as ours. %$* 552
if the price on carbon incentivised the market you’d see a lot more going on in europe than we do. %$* 552
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are. %$* 13
we’re about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and this is their last chance to change your minds. %$* 13
remember you voted before the debate and we’re going to ask you to vote once again right after their closing statements. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most of your minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so round three closing statements, each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery." here to summarize his position against the motion, steven hayward, f. k. weyerhaeuser fellow at the american enterprise institute and author of the "almanac for environmental trends." %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 552
remember that the motion tonight is directed not at whether we think clean energy however defined is a good thing, or a necessary thing, but whether clean energy can be the sector that will lead this country out of what we’re still calling the great recession. %$* 552
now i wish we could talk more about this. %$* 552
if you mandate or subsidize something of course you’ll create jobs and if the government spends lots of money on something, you will create jobs. %$* 552
that’s why we do defense spending because it’s necessary and if you have a defense plant in your area of course you create lots of jobs. %$* 552
but of course if we thought just the government spending money on things was the answer to prosperity we would never cut the defense budget after a war. %$* 552
the reason we build prisons, because it’s necessary. %$* 552
and there’s lots more demand for prisons unfortunately in this country, but no one thinks that, that is the path to prosperity, even though it creates jobs. %$* 552
the question does it create net new jobs across the economy, does it add value where value doesn’t currently exist. %$* 552
the light bulbs up here really don’t discriminate what kind of electron it comes from. %$* 552
electrons are all the same, these lights don’t care whether it’s from a coal fire powered plant or natural gas or a windmill except when the windmill is not turning. %$* 552
a problem we haven’t talked about a lot is the reliability of many forms of clean energy. %$* 552
i cannot think ever of a sector of the economy that led us out of a recession because the government mandated that we buy the product. %$* 552
and i could spend a lot of time talking about some of the important things that have been pointed to like the internet, jet turbine engines which were the result of government research, but not mandates that the public buy them. %$* 552
i think for all these reasons the sign behind us says think twice, i think you should think twice about letting sentimental slogans do our thinking for us rather than the hard headed reality of the energy world. %$* 552
thank you. %$* 552
thank you, steven hayward. %$* 13
kassia, do i pronounce your firm, "tana"? %$* 13
tana. %$* 553
tana, okay, i just wanted to be correct, because you were a late entry i didn’t get pronunciations on all this. %$* 13
and thank you again for filling in, it was terrific that you did this. %$* 13
our motion is clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery and here to summarize for the motion, kassia yanosek, founding principal of tana energy capital and cofounder of the u.s. partnership for renewable energy finance. %$* 13
well i’d like to summarize tonight by saying first of all our opposing side has done us a great benefit tonight. %$* 553
they’ve said that they’re bullish on solar, that natural gas is clean, that apple is a great example of a company that has innovated here but manufactures their products abroad in china. %$* 553
and all of those points help us because essentially they’re saying that they agree with us, that the clean energy economy will help to grow our economy and get us into a state of recovery. %$* 553
i’d also like to bring it back to why i’m here tonight. %$* 553
i’m not an environmentalist; i don’t like bats and birds. %$* 553
i like making money and i wouldn’t be here talking about the importance of clean energy if i didn’t think that there was an opportunity for investors and consumers to improve our state by either making money or reducing our costs of consuming energy. %$* 553
we’ve talked about subsidies; we've talked about how subsidies in the united states help dirty and clean energy. %$* 553
we've been in agreement that we're seeing costs come down the cost curve for many clean energy technologies, whether it be batteries for electric vehicles, or solar energy. %$* 553
and we've also agreed here that, you know, oil price spikes aren't great. %$* 553
and therefore, we need to be expanding our energy options into a variety of different fuels, clean and dirty, and make them cleaner. %$* 553
so, i would just finalize here, my points, by saying, i think that we need to be focusing on what's actually going to be getting us into this next stage of growing our economy. %$* 553
and we're already doing that. %$* 553
we're already seeing energy technology move to a place where, we saw it and biotech 10, 20, 30 years ago. %$* 553
and it's about focusing on the technology, focusing on the smart policies that actually promote energy innovation, and promote pooling technologies and having them compete with one another. %$* 553
and finally, it's about policies that actually bring finance into the, into this industry. %$* 553
and leverage-- %$* 553
tana. %$* 553
thank you, kassia your time's up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 553
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is “clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” here to summarize his position against the motion, robert bryce, author of “power hungry: the myths of green energy and the real fuels of the future.” %$* 13
recall the motion. %$* 554
“clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” the key word there is “drive,” that this is going to be the catalyst for the economic recovery. %$* 554
energy transitions, like it or not, happen over decades, or even centuries, not years. %$* 554
and that economic recovery, the implied timeline here is maybe a half-decade? %$* 554
steve and i have repeatedly shown that this “clean energy” term is so vague as to be meaningless. %$* 554
that's one reason why you should vote against this motion. %$* 554
in 1974, richard nixon promised that we would be energy independent in six years. %$* 554
today, we import a lot of foreign oil. %$* 554
we've been an importer of foreign oil since 1908, a net crude oil importer since 1908.now, we hear president obama saying 80 percent of our electricity will be clean energy by the year 2035.we didn't get energy independence, and we won't meet this goal of 80 percent of our electricity from clean energy by 2035 either. %$* 554
because it is such a nebulous idea. %$* 554
if everything is clean energy, then nothing is. %$* 554
look at the latest numbers from the eia.today we produce about 50 percent of our electricity from coal. %$* 554
their latest projections are that, by 2035, coal will still be providing about 40 percent of our electricity. %$* 554
why? %$* 554
because of cost. %$* 554
the latest eia projections also show that by 2035, coal, oil, and natural gas will be providing 78 percent of our primary energy. %$* 554
that's only slightly down from 83 percent today. %$* 554
clean energy won't fuel america's economic recovery, because we don't know exactly what it means. %$* 554
unfortunately, steve and i can't talk about power density, and cost, and scale, in ways that will drive these points home. %$* 554
it takes physics, it takes math. %$* 554
this issue that we're hearing, this beating of the drum for clean energy, unfortunately, is just a further cheapening of our political discussion in this country. %$* 554
rather than having real discussions about energy and energy policy, we're stuck with yet another slogan, and that will not help our economic recovery at all. %$* 554
thank you, robert bryce. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 554
the motion: “clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” and here to summarize his position for the motion, bill ritter, director of the center for the new energy economy at colorado state university, and former governor of colorado. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 551
thank you very much for your time and your attention tonight. %$* 551
this is a debate that's far more important than any kind of political slogan, or any kind of politicking. %$* 551
this is a debate that i think has everything to do with the economic future of this state, this country, and quite frankly, the future for our kids and our grandkids. %$* 551
and people who think that americans don't care what kind of power source delivers electricity through a light bulb are wrong about that. %$* 551
everything that i've seen, in terms of public opinion polling, says that americans absolutely do care that we make investments in clean energy. %$* 551
why do they care about it? %$* 551
they care about it because they believe that, in this place, america, that we are inventors, that we are creators. %$* 551
you can look at costs and say, “costs of this, and that's why coal will be, going forward, 40 percent of our energy.” that's a static view of the world. %$* 551
it doesn't take into account the tremendous cost curve reductions that we've seen in a variety of places that are absolutely non-carbon sources of energy, solar, wind, and things of that nature. %$* 551
and, quite frankly, americans believe in the star of innovation and creation, and say, “yeah, we can do it.” we can do it with the right set of policies. %$* 551
and we're not here defending every subsidy and saying it has to happen this way, in a subsidized way. %$* 551
what we're saying is, if you put the right set of policies in place to support taxing-- %$* 551
sorry-- %$* 551
financing, technology, and those things that help bring technologies forward and move them forward, then you get to a place where you can see a vision for a clean energy economy that can be part of this economic recovery. %$* 551
states across the country have seen job growth because they committed investments and innovation. %$* 551
they committed policy to this, and they’ve seen job growth in this sector and no other sector. %$* 551
and that’s just one laboratory. %$* 551
if we did it at the federal level and we did it as a nation, we would see economic recovery in this sector even in the place where we’re slow to recover in a variety of other sectors because it’s a global market and a global demand. %$* 551
thank you. %$* 551
bill ritter, thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we’re asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
our motion is “clean energy can drive america’s economic recovery.” if you agree with the motion, having heard the arguments, press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, press number two. %$* 13
if you are or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we will have the results in just a minute. %$* 13
and also, in san francisco and in washington, d.c., our observers there are also registering their vote, and we’re going to report both results tonight. %$* 13
so, before we get to the results which will only take about a minute, a few things i want to take care of. %$* 13
first of all, i would really like to-- %$* 13
i’ve already thanked you personally, kassia, but i’d like to thank all four of our panelists for coming here, really bringing their game today. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, all of you. %$* 13
and tonight was one of those nights when the questions from the audience members were actually terrific and on point no matter what kind of hat you’re wearing. %$* 13
i want to thank all of the people who got up and asked questions because it’s not that easy to do. %$* 13
and a special thank you goes out to the american clean skies foundation for helping to underwrite this season of debates. %$* 13
and again, thank you greg staples. %$* 13
and what this season is about is a theme that we call “america’s house divided,” and our next debate will be tuesday, april 5.the motion then, “it’s time to clip america’s global wings.” arguing for the motion, we have peter galbraith, the u.n.’s deputy special representative for afghanistan in 2009, the first u.s.ambassador to croatia as well where he was actively involved in the bosnia and croatia peace process. %$* 13
joining him as his teammate is lawrence korb and assistant secretary of defense under ronald reagan, korb was once in charge of administering 70 percent of the defense budget. %$* 13
he is currently a senior fellow at the center for american progress. %$* 13
arguing against the motion are elliott abrams, a fellow at the council on foreign relations who held positions in the reagan administration and the george w.bush administration where he was deputy national security adviser in charge of middle eastern affairs. %$* 13
his partner will be elliot cohen. %$* 13
we have a double elliot coming up, and that’s very rare. %$* 13
he’s a professor at-- %$* 13
i was once on a shoot for abc news in romania, and i was joined by three abc colleagues. %$* 13
all came from different countries. %$* 13
we all converged there, and all three of them were named bruno. %$* 13
now that is rare. %$* 13
eliot cohen is professor of the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins who, despite taking the bush administration to task over its handling of the iraq war, served as counselor at the department of state. %$* 13
tickets are available for those debates, for that debate and others following through our web site and at the skirball box office. %$* 13
and you can also follow intelligence squared u.s.on twitter. %$* 13
and make sure to become a fan on facebook to receive a discount on upcoming debates. %$* 13
and actually, this entire debate was streamed live on facebook tonight. %$* 13
this is the first time that we’ve done that. %$* 13
also, all of our debates, as we’ve said before, can be heard on npr stations across the country, and you can watch the debates on the bloomberg television network starting next monday at 9pm. %$* 13
visit bloomberg.com to find your local channel. %$* 13
so i’m just waiting for the results to come. %$* 13
they’re probably taking a little bit longer because of the d.c.and san francisco votes. %$* 13
and since i mentioned charles ferguson earlier, oscar winner, i don’t know if you’re actually here because i never saw you. %$* 13
are you here, charles? %$* 13
can you just shout yes? %$* 13
i am. %$* 555
you are. %$* 13
i just want to again-- %$* 13
congratulations to you. %$* 13
and an interesting little fact, my son who’s a 14-year-old eighth grader, got extra credit for going to see your movie and showing up at school with the ticket stub. %$* 13
so, as his father, i’m glad that i could contribute a little bit to your income on that, but congratulations to you. %$* 13
now, dana, do we have word from-- %$* 13
why don’t we announce the hall vote and then afterwards i can announce the d.c. and san francisco vote. %$* 13
that’s going to embarrass her a great deal. %$* 13
all right, well, talk to your neighbor. %$* 13
here it comes. %$* 13
here comes the vote. %$* 13
all right, so, we didn’t actually hear back from san francisco. %$* 13
i’m not sure what’s happening out there. %$* 13
so here are the-- %$* 13
i just want to do the math here. %$* 13
it’s pretty close in d.c.okay, so, in washington, here are the results before the debate: 52 percent were for the motion, 14 percent were against, and 34 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 46 percent are for the motion, 23 percent are against, and 31 percent undecided. %$* 13
as i see it, the “against” side won in washington by moving the number nine percent versus the “for” side’s moving at eight percent. %$* 13
so, in washington-- %$* 13
so congratulations to them. %$* 13
all right, here is the final result then from all of you in the hall who have voted twice now on the topic and motion and the arguments that you have heard. %$* 13
before the debate, 46 percent were for the motion, 21 percent against, and 33 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 43 percent are “for”-- %$* 13
that’s down three percent. %$* 13
47 percent are “against”-- %$* 13
that’s up 26 percent, and 10 percent remain undecided. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, “clean energy can drive america’s recovery,” has carried the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them, and thank you from me, john donvan, at %$* 13

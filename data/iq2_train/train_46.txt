i’m interested to hear what he has to say about this one, so let's please welcome to the stage mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
how are you? %$* 13
good. %$* 1
so i was just saying, you know, normally we're doing foreign policy and defense spending debates. %$* 13
and tonight we're going a little bit in a different direction with this discussion of the afterlife. %$* 13
so what's the thought behind putting this on the stage now? %$* 13
well, one of the things that kind of got me to think that this would be a very interesting debate is a sermon i heard in a catholic church many, many years ago, in which the priest was challenging people to believe in an afterlife. %$* 1
and the argument he made was quasi scientific. %$* 1
he said, imagine a fetus in his mother's womb that's almost ready to be born, nine-month, full-term baby. %$* 1
and you're trying to convey to this baby what's about to happen, that it's going to have an incredibly painful experience going through the birth canal, that its ties to its mother through which it's getting all kinds of nutrients and all the oxygen is going to be severed. %$* 1
but not to worry, there's going to be a great life afterwards. %$* 1
there's going to be all kinds of experiences and sensory things and development and emotional growth and just an incredible world that you cannot imagine. %$* 1
and when you think about that, of course, you say, of course you could-- %$* 1
there's no way you could communicate that. %$* 1
and there's no way that the baby could understand it. %$* 1
and yet we all know it's true. %$* 1
so it kind of invites you to think, is it possible that there's something that we can't-- %$* 1
we can not imagine, that we don't understand, but nonetheless is true about life after death? %$* 1
i mean, i want to ask you one point about the approach we're taking to this. %$* 13
but before we get to that, do you have a lot of these epiphanies in churches? %$* 13
well, i'm jewish, actually. %$* 1
but-- %$* 1
you know, the jews do have the highest resurrection rate in the world. %$* 1
my question is, we're not looking at this is a religious debate, speaking of which, we're really taking a different cut at it. %$* 13
no, of course. %$* 1
and that's what i think sort of makes it much more of a factually grounded and intellectually grounded argument, and it's the reason we're doing this, is to take it away from the questions purely of faith and try to do as scientific an approach as we can to this topic which obviously interests a lot of people. %$* 1
well, the great thing is we have four scientists debating tonight, so let's welcome them to the stage, and thank you to bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
okay. %$* 13
now i can see. %$* 13
and i just want to actually invite one more round of applause to bob rosenkranz for making this all possible. %$* 13
so the difference between going to heaven some day and getting hit in the head with a hammer right now is that going to heaven some day sounds so much better than getting hit in the head with a hammer right now. %$* 13
but at least with the hammer, you know that the hammer is real. %$* 13
science can see the hammer. %$* 13
science can weigh it and take its measurements and even cut it up into little pieces and put it into test tubes. %$* 13
but heaven, the afterlife, science cannot see that, not with a telescope, not with a microscope. %$* 13
so does that mean that heaven is not as real as the hammer? %$* 13
or does it just mean that science and scientists don't know yet how to find heaven, how to look for it? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: death is not final, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, scientists all, but they divide on this issue: death is not final. %$* 13
they will argue two against two for and against. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then the live audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters and the team arguing for the motion, death is not final, please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome eben alexander. %$* 13
and eben, in a way, you are our founding story in this debate tonight. %$* 13
you are an academic neurosurgeon, 15 years on the faculty of harvard medical school. %$* 13
but in 2008, you got very, very sick. %$* 13
you went in a coma for seven days. %$* 13
your brain effectively stopped showing signs of life in the higher functions. %$* 13
and you came back, and you said, "i was there. %$* 13
i saw it. %$* 13
i've seen the afterlife." in one word, what did you see? %$* 13
what was it? %$* 13
astonishing. %$* 234
astonishing. %$* 13
and if you had heard somebody, back before you had this experience, make that same sort of claim, what would you have said? %$* 13
"no way," at least not until i knew all the facts. %$* 234
we'll hear more of the facts from you tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, eben alexander. %$* 13
and eben, your partner is? %$* 13
my very good friend, dr. %$* 234
raymond moody. %$* 234
ladies and gentlemen, raymond moody. %$* 13
and raymond, you are also arguing for this motion that death is not final. %$* 13
you're a psychiatrist, and you have a medical degree, a doctorate in philosophy. %$* 13
you are described as "the founder of the near death experience." you coined that phrase in your book in 1975, "life after life," in which you looked at more than a hundred cases of people who had experienced clinical death and come back. %$* 13
you've been looking at this now for decades. %$* 13
but it's interesting to us to note that your curiosity in this whole thing was piqued not by religious conviction. %$* 13
what was it? %$* 13
no, i'm-- %$* 235
i was not-- %$* 235
can you just move a little closer to your mic. %$* 13
yes. %$* 235
i was not religious. %$* 235
i got interested in the afterlife question at age 18 when plato convinced me, through his argument, that the afterlife question is the most important question of existence. %$* 235
we're going to be hearing about plato tonight? %$* 13
yes. %$* 235
we're looking forward to it. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, raymond moody. %$* 13
and that's the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and now the team to argue against this motion, "death is not final," please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome sean carroll. %$* 13
sean, you are a physicist at the california institute of technology. %$* 13
your research focuses on fundamental physics and cosmology, the study –of the origin and the evolution of the universe. %$* 13
you've written a lot of books, including "the particle at the end of the universe," which is about the quest to discover the higgs boson, which is a celebrity among particles. %$* 13
and you have described yourself as a naturalist. %$* 13
so for the purposes of understanding where you're coming from, what does that term briefly mean? %$* 13
a naturalist is one who believes there is one world, the natural world. %$* 236
and it is our job to deal with it. %$* 236
and are you dealing? %$* 13
okay. %$* 236
so far so good. %$* 236
sean carroll. %$* 13
and, sean, tell us who your partner is? %$* 13
the talented and charming steven novella. %$* 236
ladies and gentlemen, steven novella. %$* 13
steven, you are also arguing against the motion that death is not final. %$* 13
you are a neurologist at yale school of medicine. %$* 13
you're the founder of the website, "science- based medicine," cofounder of the new england skeptical society. %$* 13
we sense, you know, there's a theme running through this. %$* 13
you know, you-- %$* 13
the skeptic's guide to the universe is your podcast. %$* 13
so you're doing all of this neurology. %$* 13
why did you decide to put yourself out there as a skeptic? %$* 13
well, i had briefly considered a career in interpretive dance. %$* 237
but sadly, i had to conclude that my talents lay elsewhere. %$* 237
so i thought science skepticism was a good match. %$* 237
the dance of skepticism. %$* 13
the dance of skepticism. %$* 237
i'll work on that. %$* 237
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our debaters tonight. %$* 13
and this is a debate. %$* 13
our motion is "death is not final." and in this debate, we go in three rounds, and only one side will win. %$* 13
and that side will be chosen by you, our live audience. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice; once before the debate and once again afterwards to tell us where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the first vote. %$* 13
if you go to these key pads at your seat, look again at the motion on the screens: death is not final. %$* 13
if you are for this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you are against it, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three, which is, by the way, a perfectly honorable position with which to start this debate. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong one, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote, and we're going to wrap this up in about 12 seconds. %$* 13
okay, looks like everybody's done. %$* 13
so let's move on. %$* 13
let's start this debate. %$* 13
let's get on to round one. %$* 13
round one, our motion is, "death is not final." in round one, we have opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and here to speak first for the motion, eben alexander. %$* 13
he is an academic neurosurgeon who taught at harvard medical school. %$* 13
he is author also of the bestselling book, "proof of heaven." ladies and gentlemen, eben alexander. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 234
i've been an academic neurosurgeon for over 20 years, and i fully believed in reductive materialism, our modern conventional science. %$* 234
in fact, six years ago i would've been sitting over on that side of the stage with steven and sean. %$* 234
now, at that time i believed that the brain creates mind and consciousness, that we have no free will, that it's birth to death and nothing more. %$* 234
then something happened. %$* 234
i now know that those ideas are false. %$* 234
in november 2008 i was driven rapidly into coma due to a severe bacterial meningoencephalitis which i much later came to realize is the perfect model for human death, destruction of the neocortex, the outer surface, the human part of the brain. %$* 234
sadly almost no one returns, much less recovers, from a case of meningitis as severe as mine. %$* 234
the last evidence of any activity in my neocortex was in the first hour, so in the emergency room and afterwards i demonstrated only very pathological reflexes including severe brainstem damage. %$* 234
given my gram negative bacterial meningoencephalitis, which i was found to have, and my descent into coma over three and a half hours, i had at best a 10 percent chance of survival at the very beginning. %$* 234
it only got worse. %$* 234
mine was an absolutely lethal meningitis. %$* 234
my white cell count in my cerebral spinal fluid was 4,300 and a protein of 1,340.both those numbers should be zero. %$* 234
in fact, the glucose in that fluid, normally 60 to 80, and maybe as low as 20 in a severe case of bacterial meningitis, went all the way down to one. %$* 234
none of the consultants in my case, from harvard, uva, duke, or wake forest had ever seen that severe a case. %$* 234
my doctors never found a cause. %$* 234
the scan showed diffuse destruction of my neocortex with blurring of the gray-white junction over all eight lobes of my brain. %$* 234
no area was spared. %$* 234
later in the week, off all sedation, my neurological activity was almost nil. %$* 234
with what's called a glass glaucoma scale, which in everybody in this room would be 15 and a corpse is three, my scale was ranging from three to five. %$* 234
this was a very severe meningitis. %$* 234
on day seven, with no residual neocortical function, brain stem badly damaged, reflecting the deadly nature of my illness, my doctors recommended, because i was down to a 2 percent chance of survival by that point, with a best case scenario that if i survived i'd spend a month or two in the hospital, be transferred to a nursing home, and die in a coma months later, hence, they recommended just stopping the antibiotics. %$* 234
my journey deep in the coma began in a very primitive unresponsive realm, which i later called the "earthworm's eye-view," the best consciousness my brain could muster, soaking in pus. %$* 234
my prior neuroscientific view would've dictated that the next step would be one of no awareness at all. %$* 234
yet, it was just the opposite, like the blinders coming off. %$* 234
i ascended into far more crisp, vibrant, ultra real realms of pure joy, love, and understanding, realms i called the "gateway in the core," far too rich and complex to fully describe. %$* 234
soon thereafter i started to return to this world, but with my brain so wrecked that i had no memory of words or language, nothing of eben alexander's life before coma, any religious concepts, et cetera, yet i knew the entire ultra-real odyssey that i had just been deep in coma, went so extensive it seemed to last for months, even though it had to fit within seven days of earth time. %$* 234
words came back to me over hours and days, childhood memories over weeks, and knowledge of brain-mind consciousness of more than 20 years' experience in neurosurgery came back over two months. %$* 234
my doctors have no explanation at all for my full recovery. %$* 234
other cases of medically inexplicable healing do occur in transcendental near-death experiences, like those of anita moorjani and dr. %$* 234
george rodonaia. %$* 234
in the 36 hours after emerging from coma, i was in and out of a delusional, paranoid, psychotic nightmare that was completely different, not even in the same ballpark, when compared to the ultra-reality of the deep-coma experience in the gateway in the core. %$* 234
those experiences deep in coma seem almost seem to weigh too real to be real. %$* 234
my doctor's believing that the brain creates consciousness, and knowing the destruction they had seen in my brain, had told me that i could not have had any such experience in the depth of coma, and therefore just to forget about it. %$* 234
i knew i'd experienced something and sensed that it had to do with the fundamental flaw in the models of consciousness and the-- %$* 234
and the role of the neocortex. %$* 234
early on, i tried to explain all of this as a brain-based phenomenon based on my old paradigm, writing it up as a report for the neuroscience literature. %$* 234
it's important that when i was emerging from that coma, i saw six faces at the very end. %$* 234
and these were faces that were very important in helping me to realize that the entire coma experience happened between days 1 and 5 of my coma, and not at the very end. %$* 234
over those weeks of recording my experience after coma, i also began to talk with my doctors and review my medical records, especially neurological examinations and the scans, and came to realize just how deathly ill i was and how there was no way that such an ultra-real crisp and vibrant experience could have happened in my physical brain. %$* 234
modern neuroscientific ideas of the neocortex and consciousness would dictate that i should have experienced nothing at all beyond that earthworm's eye view. %$* 234
i wrote the entire experience down, 20,000 words that i wrote over six weeks, before i read anything about near death experiences. %$* 234
i have never read that literature before. %$* 234
initially, i was very worried that the memories would fade. %$* 234
those memories are as sharp today as when they happened. %$* 234
memories of the delusional paranoid psychotic nightmare that occurred over those 36 hours after i came out of coma faded within weeks. %$* 234
very different origin. %$* 234
i had never read nde literature before, and was shocked to find that the experience seemed hyperreal in over half of nde accounts, and the memories do not fade like those of hallucinations, dreams, confabulations, or drug effects. %$* 234
people recount their own nde stories to me by the hundreds, usually starting-- %$* 234
i'd never told anyone this before, but even from over 50 years ago, as if they happened yesterday, i came to see that the similarities in the nde and afterlife literature far outweighed the differences. %$* 234
and the commonalities across cultures, beliefs, continents, and millennia indicate an underlying constant reality of that realm. %$* 234
many of the petty differences are due to our being so restricted by our earthly language. %$* 234
this is not like we're describing a trip to disneyland. %$* 234
personal biases and religious beliefs might taint the telling of those stories. %$* 234
but the core similarities remain striking. %$* 234
i'm sorry. %$* 13
and thank you very much. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
eben alexander. %$* 13
our motion is death is not final. %$* 13
and here to speak against this motion, sean caroll. %$* 13
he is a physicist at the california institute of technology. %$* 13
he is the author of several books, including "the particle at the end of the universe." ladies and gentlemen, sean caroll. %$* 13
thanks, john. %$* 236
it's a pleasure to be here defending such a cheerful and uplifting proposition, as death is, in fact, final. %$* 236
driving around the streets of los angeles, where i live, you can't help but notice these gigantic billboards telling us "all men must die." turns out they were advertisements for "game of thrones," but i thought that they were advertisements for-- %$* 236
our event here tonight. %$* 236
it's a similarly-- %$* 236
you know, not quit as happy message as we might like to accept. %$* 236
fortunately, we can open dr. %$* 236
alexander's book. %$* 236
it begins with a quote from albert einstein. %$* 236
einstein says, "a man should look for what is, not for what he thinks should be," to which i would like to reply, "exactly." we human beings are not always perfectly rational. %$* 236
let me tell this shocking news to you. %$* 236
we are bundles of cognitive biases. %$* 236
and one of the strongest biases we have is that we go easy on propositions that we would like to be true. %$* 236
what we should, in fact, do, is go especially skeptical on propositions that we would like to be true. %$* 236
and even i want it to be true, that death is not final. %$* 236
but we should hold something like that to an extraordinarily high standard of evidence. %$* 236
so, what are we actually being asked to accept? %$* 236
what should we expect the world to be like if death were not, actually final? %$* 236
for one thing, i would expect that the existence of souls persisting in the afterlife should be perfectly obvious. %$* 236
it should be just as clear that heaven exists as it is clear that canada exists. %$* 236
but in fact, it seems that the souls persisting in the afterlife are kind of shy. %$* 236
they don't talk to us, except sometimes they do talk to us. %$* 236
i would expect, also, that when people did have near death experiences, and really talked to other souls in the afterlife, that they would come back with consistent, interesting, non-trivial stories to tell. %$* 236
but in fact, when christians have near-death experiences, they often say they've met jesus. %$* 236
when hindus have near-death experiences, they meet hindu deities. %$* 236
there was a little girl who had a near-death experience, and she met a portly man wearing a red cap. %$* 236
she met santa claus. %$* 236
and we are told by some defenders of this that, well, jesus dressed up as santa claus so as not to scare the little girl. %$* 236
possibly, that is true. %$* 236
but we should be asking, are there other plausible explanations? %$* 236
i especially think that if we went and had a life after death and then came back to visit us, bringing some message back, that message would-- %$* 236
should be as useful as possible. %$* 236
we are told that, you know, people have after death experiences, and they come back saying, you know what? %$* 236
love is really important. %$* 236
i agree with that. %$* 236
but actually, i knew it already. %$* 236
what i would like to know is the cure for alzheimer's disease. %$* 236
what i would like to know is something that i didn't already know brought back to us. %$* 236
but it seems that the souls in the afterlife tend to speak in platitudes. %$* 236
the story that we're told of life after death doesn't really hang together. %$* 236
what we have are personal testimonies like that from dr. %$* 236
alexander. %$* 236
so people say, with very sincere voices, that what they experienced was totally real. %$* 236
and i have no doubt in the sincerity of this testimony. %$* 236
what i'm asking is, is it possible that our brain is telling us that something was real, but that thing does not actually correspond to something that really happened. %$* 236
and when you ask it that way, the answer is obviously yes. %$* 236
our brains are fooling us all the time. %$* 236
steve novella, my partner, will tell us about the neuroscience behind this. %$* 236
but basically, our brains are not like video recorders or photo albums. %$* 236
they're more like little theaters. %$* 236
when we try to remember something, it's much like imagining something that hasn't happened. %$* 236
it's more like running a script than reviewing a tape. %$* 236
and that's why, when we dream, when we hallucinate, when we have a near-death experience, it is just as vivid as something that actually happened. %$* 236
in the legal community, they will tell you that eyewitnesses who tell you that-- %$* 236
have a certain sincerity and conviction that their eyewitness testimony is true, that conviction is essentially uncorrelated with now true it actually is. %$* 236
the vividness or reality of a memory does not tell us that it was really real. %$* 236
so what is going on? %$* 236
we had this informal idea that there is a soul that sort of is a blob of spirit energy that takes up residence near the brain and drives us around like a soccer mom driving an suv. %$* 236
but we've known for a long time that this picture doesn't make sense. %$* 236
back in the 1600s, princess elizabeth of bohemia carried on a correspondence with rené descarteswho was trying to defend mind-body dualism. %$* 236
and elizabeth demands, no, how could something immaterial like the soul affect something material like the brain or the body? %$* 236
descartes was never able to answer that question. %$* 236
and these days, science has gone way beyond that. %$* 236
we know a lot more about what is happening. %$* 236
we can literally see memories being formed. %$* 236
we can see the chemical changes in neurons. %$* 236
so the soul is supposed to also have memories. %$* 236
how do the memories get from the neurons to the soul? %$* 236
we know that brains often have false memories in them. %$* 236
does the soul in the afterlife carry those false memories, or are they somehow corrected after death? %$* 236
we even know the laws of physics by which the atoms, the electrons, the elementary particles in our brains behave. %$* 236
we know the equations that the electrons that are responsible for chemistry obey. %$* 236
and there's no ambiguity in these equations. %$* 236
they could always be wrong. %$* 236
it is always possible to say, well, we just don't know what is going on. %$* 236
that's fine. %$* 236
but what we have is the evidence of every experiment ever done telling us that these equations are correct. %$* 236
to overcome that, we would need very, very strong evidence, just one experiment, telling us how the soul is pushing around the chemicals in our brain. %$* 236
but we don't have that. %$* 236
what science says is that life or consciousness is not a substance like water or air. %$* 236
it is a process like fire. %$* 236
when you put out the flame on a candle, the flame doesn't go anywhere, it simply stops. %$* 236
and that is what happens when we die. %$* 236
so we're faced at the end with two scenarios. %$* 236
one scenario says that everything we think we understand about the behavior of matter and energy is wrong in a way that has somehow escaped notice by every experiment ever done in the history of science. %$* 236
and instead, there are unknown mechanisms that allow information in the brain to the transferred to blobs of spirit energy that persist after we die and can talk to the other blobs of spirit energy, but don't talk to us, expect sometimes they do. %$* 236
the other scenario says that physics is right and that people under stress sometimes have experiences that are not actually real. %$* 236
on the basis of rationality, it not a difficult decision to choose between these two options. %$* 236
on the basis of emotion, it might be difficult. %$* 236
but we need to have the courage to live life here in the actual world. %$* 236
thank you. %$* 236
thank you, sean carroll. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is: "death is not final." we have two debaters, two against two, arguing for and against this motion. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have heard from the first two debaters and now onto the third. %$* 13
here to argue for the motion, "death is not final," raymond moody. %$* 13
he's a medical doctor with a phd in philosophy, author of numerous books on near- death experience, including, the seminal "life after life." raymond moody. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 235
since 1965, i've had the honor of interviewing thousands of people from all over the world who had near-death experiences. %$* 235
and unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for the last 40 years, you've all heard about this, that people on the brink of death tell us that they leave their bodies, and they go into a beautiful light which they find very difficult to describe. %$* 235
and in that light say that relatives or friends of theirs who have already died seem to be there to meet them and to help them through this transition. %$* 235
and they have panoramic memory in which they see all of the events of their lives displayed around them in a sort of holographic panorama of which they witness instantaneously. %$* 235
my assessment from 40-something years of working on this, and i will underline that word "assessment" is that in the words of the proposition, death is not final. %$* 235
but i want to translate a little bit to say that what i'm trying to say with that is that in my opinion, at death, personal consciousness is taken up into a more inclusive state of reality or frame of existence in a way that people who go through this find it very difficult to put into words. %$* 235
one of the most common things they say is, however articulate they may be, they say that this experience is ineffable, or indescribable. %$* 235
i want to emphasize here something at the very beginning. %$* 235
and please hear me out on this one. %$* 235
i have decided, or sort of assessed the situation, that there is a life after death. %$* 235
however, i want to say anybody who tells you in the year 2014 that that is a scientific matter is not thinking clearly. %$* 235
in 2014, the question of life after death is not yet a scientific question. %$* 235
i am not a parapsychologist. %$* 235
and i think parapsychology is a pseudo science. %$* 235
so there's a different frame of reference to think about this, though. %$* 235
and that is that reason is a much bigger category than science. %$* 235
scientific method is about, say, 400 years old. %$* 235
reason itself is about 2300 years old, a much bigger institution that includes history and philosophy and literary theory and the law in addition to scientific thinking. %$* 235
so what i am suggesting to you is that the solution to the afterlife question is not going to come initially from science, but rather from, i think, the whole area of critical thinking and logic. %$* 235
as i look back on the debate that-- %$* 235
on near-death experiences that's gone on for almost 2500 years now, what strikes me is that a big part of the problem is that the format of the debate is basically twisted. %$* 235
since democritus and plato fought this out 2300 years ago, the way we've debated this is we say that some people look at these near-death experiences, and they take it at face value, as plato did, and they say, well, this is an indicator of an afterlife. %$* 235
other people democritus being an example, said, as democritus famously did, "there is no such thing as a moment of death," implying that therefore what he's getting is that these near-death experiences are just the patient's perception of the winding down process of the body. %$* 235
the trouble with this whole debate is that that format of debate itself is incoherent. %$* 235
we can't keep debating it that way. %$* 235
let me give you an indication of why. %$* 235
all of the elements that we think of as a near-death experience, getting out of the body, going into this light, seeing a panoramic review of one's life, seeing apparitions of the deceased occur very commonly, not just to people who almost die and are brought back, but rather to the healthy and uninjured bystanders at the bedside of someone else, shared death experiences, as i call these. %$* 235
as the person in the bed, it's fairly common that bystanders will say that they themselves leave their bodies and accompany their dying loved ones partway toward this light, or they see the apparitions of relatives and friends of the dying person come into the room. %$* 235
so my question is, if the causation of these near-death experiences is the physiological distress and the events going on in the brain, why should the bystanders who are not ill or injured have identically the same experience? %$* 235
so i think that we're into a situation with this now where really the problem has sort of outgrown the format that we use to debate about it. %$* 235
in my opinion, we really are on the verge of breakthroughs in the genuine, and i will underline "genuine," rational investigation of the question of life after death. %$* 235
and in that context, i think there are two people in history who have more than anyone else i think stated this afterlife question very clearly and the major problems that come with it, plato being one, who said that, "whenever we talk about the afterlife, there's always going to be the narrative aspect, a story, because we've got to have some sort of story just to get thought about this kind of thing started, but also we've got to have some sort of set of concepts to link the-- %$* 235
these narratives with the statement of what-- %$* 235
that there is life after death." i think that's coming. %$* 235
i think that we are on the brink of a breakthrough in rational study of an afterlife, but it's not going to come initially from science, but initially from the realms of logic and critical thinking. %$* 235
so thank you very much. %$* 235
thank you, raymond moody. %$* 13
and our motion is, "death is not final," and here is our final debater against this motion, steven novella. %$* 13
he is an academic clinical neurologist at yale university school of medicine, as well as the host of the weekly science podcast, "the skeptics' guide to the universe." ladies and gentlemen, steven novella. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 237
thanks, john. %$* 237
i want to say thank you to the intelligence squared debate for inviting me here. %$* 237
it's an honor to be here. %$* 237
so i'm going to convince you that you need to vote against this proposition because if you vote for the notion that death is not final then you-- %$* 237
that by necessity means that you are voting against the conclusion, the scientific position, that the mind is what the brain does. %$* 237
the mind is a process of the brain itself. %$* 237
you would have to reject that in order to accept that the mind exists without the brain. %$* 237
well, how sure are we? %$* 237
how confident are we in-- %$* 237
as a scientific conclusion, which is what we're here to talk about, that the mind is essentially the brain? %$* 237
well, we're very certain about that, and we're as confident of that as we are of anything in science. %$* 237
we have a mountain of neuroscience, countless experiments, that look for the neuroanatomical correlates of consciousness, of the brain functioning, of the mind. %$* 237
everything that you think, feel, believe, is something that's happening inside the brain, demonstrably. %$* 237
but let's take that as a scientific hypothesis. %$* 237
if the mind is entirely the brain, then what must also be true? %$* 237
well, then if the arrow of causation's going from brain to mind, then if we change the brain, that should change the mind. %$* 237
and if we damage the brain, that should damage the mind. %$* 237
and if we turn off the brain, that should turn off the mind. %$* 237
well, if all of those propositions are correct, that strongly supports the notion that the mind is essentially the brain, and that is, in fact, exactly what scientists have discovered over and over again over the last one to two centuries of neuroscience. %$* 237
i can give you-- %$* 237
i'm a neurologist, so i can give you tons of examples from my own personal clinical experience. %$* 237
but let me just tell you about one very interesting neurological phenomenon called capgras syndrome. %$* 237
this is a syndrome in which-- %$* 237
well, i'll give you-- %$* 237
i'll back up a little bit. %$* 237
so when you're looking at, let's say, the face of your wife or your spouse, what's forming on your retina is just shapes and shadows and colors and lines, but your brain has to construct that into an actual image. %$* 237
but then it also have to give meaning to the image. %$* 237
it has to tell you that these shapes are, in fact, a face. %$* 237
and then another part of the brain tells you, "that's not just any face. %$* 237
that's the face i know well. %$* 237
that's the face of my spouse, the face of my wife." now, assuming, however, you have feelings about your wife-- %$* 237
let's assume that-- %$* 237
then-- %$* 237
there's also a connection between that part of your brain that tells you that that face is your wife to the limbic system. %$* 237
that's the emotional part of your brain. %$* 237
and that connects your emotions, your feelings about your wife to that image. %$* 237
so, when you see your wife, those feelings are connected to it. %$* 237
those are all circuits that are happening demonstrably in your brain. %$* 237
now, in capgras syndrome, that last connection is broken by a stroke, by damage, by something. %$* 237
so, when someone sees their spouse, they recognize them as their spouse. %$* 237
but the feelings aren't there. %$* 237
so, what do people conclude when this happens? %$* 237
well, it's interesting. %$* 237
when people have brain damage, it affects how their brain constructs their image of reality, because as my-- %$* 237
as sean was saying, are-- %$* 237
we don't have a tape recorder in our minds, in our brains. %$* 237
we are constructing reality and image of reality all the time. %$* 237
it's a very active process. %$* 237
and when you-- %$* 237
when that process breaks down, then your construction of reality breaks down. %$* 237
so-- %$* 237
and you usually don't have insight into that, especially initially, because we tend to assume that our experience is a real, continuous experience. %$* 237
that's also something your brain constructs. %$* 237
so, what do people conclude when they have this syndrome, that circuit is broken in their brain? %$* 237
they conclude that their wife, their spouse must be an impostor .that's the only explanation that they can come up with. %$* 237
there's, in fact, a documented case of a husband who murdered his wife because he was convinced that an impostor had replaced his wife, you know, with an exact-- %$* 237
you know, it makes no sense, but that's the only way his brain could make sense of its broken construction of reality. %$* 237
and there's endless examples of this. %$* 237
there's no limit-- %$* 237
there is no practical or functional limit that neuroscientists have encountered so far to the degree which we can mess with your mind by messing with your brain. %$* 237
your-- %$* 237
your sense that you're in your body, that you control your body, that you separate from the universe-- %$* 237
basic fundamental things about your concept of yourself and your experience of reality are all things demonstrably happening in the brain, and we could turn it off like a switch. %$* 237
now we actually have the technology to do that. %$* 237
so, given the mountain of evidence that the mind is the brain, we wouldn't reject this easily. %$* 237
do near death experiences provide such compelling evidence that there is mental activity outside of brain activity, that we need to reject the mountain of neuroscientific evidence that's growing every day, that tells us that the mind, in fact, is the brain? %$* 237
well, i think the answer there is definitely no as well. %$* 237
there are-- %$* 237
as sean said, there are stories-- %$* 237
anecdotes, compelling narratives. %$* 237
we're all about compelling narratives. %$* 237
that's what our brain does-- %$* 237
that people have had very unusual experiences. %$* 237
we don't doubt that they have had, you know, life-altering, unusual experiences. %$* 237
whenever your brain is constructing reality in a different way that you're not used to, that's going to be a very weird, profound experience. %$* 237
it's going to be memorable. %$* 237
it's going to be amazing. %$* 237
astonishing, even. %$* 237
we have no doubt about that. %$* 237
but it's demonstrably something happening in the brain. %$* 237
what we don't have are any documented cases of mental activity occurring when there could not be brain activity. %$* 237
now, proponents will often say that, "well, but the person remembers being, you know, in the emergency room, or they remember-- %$* 237
they have these memories that were forming while their brain wasn't functioning." but we don't know that. %$* 237
there is no case in which that's been documented. %$* 237
they easily could be forming their memories when they're coming out of their-- %$* 237
whatever state, whatever coma that they were in. %$* 237
dr. %$* 237
alexander even says he had a prolonged recovery. %$* 237
we have no idea what was happening in his brain during that period of time. %$* 237
when people are in a coma, there's still some break activity. %$* 237
there are animal experiments showing that sometimes even during an acute stress, there could be even a burst of neural activity. %$* 237
who knows what kinds of astonishing memories are occurring there? %$* 237
we have a reality testing module in our brain, a circuit in our brain that says, "this feels real to me." and that testing module could break down. %$* 237
and then things-- %$* 237
you don't test reality. %$* 237
it just seems hyperreal. %$* 237
every element of a near death experiment-- %$* 237
experience can be duplicated, can be replicated with drugs, with anoxia, with lack of blood flow, by turning off circuits in the brain. %$* 237
every single component is a brain experience that we could now reproduce. %$* 237
and we're zeroing in on the exact circuits in the brain which reproduce them. %$* 237
that's why you must vote against this proposition. %$* 237
thank you. %$* 237
thank you, steven novella. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is death is not final. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another and take questions from me and from you in the live audience. %$* 13
our motion is this: death is not final. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion. %$* 13
we have eben alexander and raymond moody who have made a presentation based very significantly on the personal experience of eben alexander. %$* 13
it's an argument based on one very, very compelling anecdote of a guy who's been there. %$* 13
he has seen it, and he is not a gullible guy and never was. %$* 13
he was trained as a scientist. %$* 13
he comes back saying that consciousness is something that is a lot bigger than the brain, that what he experienced could not be explained by brain activity, especially given the illness and the state of illness he was in when his brain was functionally nonfunctioning. %$* 13
they're also arguing that there are thousands and thousands of cases like this and that there is a consistency to these cases. %$* 13
at the same time, they say that science-- %$* 13
no, science cannot prove that the afterlife exists, but that through the use of reason and logic, we can get to that conclusion in a way that laboratory experiments cannot. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, sean carroll and steven novella, they agree with their opponents that science cannot prove that there is an afterlife. %$* 13
but they also say that science can more or less tell us that there is not and cannot be an afterlife, that the existence of an afterlife would not fit in with everything else that we know about how the way the world works, that there are all sorts of other possible biological explanations for the experiences that people come back and describe and that psychologically, we're wired to want to believe in the story of an afterlife and that that wiring influences the kinds of accounts that come back. %$* 13
so there are a lot of ways to take cuts at the debate-- %$* 13
at this debate based on what we have seen so far. %$* 13
but i want to-- %$* 13
you know, we're going to talk about the power of anecdote, the validity of anecdote. %$* 13
we're also going to talk a little bit about what we know about brain function and the state of brain function. %$* 13
and i want to start with that point as the opening, as it's the thing that we most recently heard steven novella talk about. %$* 13
and i want to go to eben alexander. %$* 13
and this debate is not eben alexander on trial. %$* 13
we agree with that. %$* 13
but you're the one with the experience. %$* 13
you've had-- %$* 13
i think you also-- %$* 13
your partner, ray moody, did you have a near-death experience? %$* 13
no. %$* 235
no? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i didn't, either, just for the record. %$* 13
eben, your opponents are arguing that what you said you experienced can be explained by-- %$* 13
by what we already know about the brain; that as they put it, you had a real experience about something that was not real. %$* 13
and i think we all understand the logic of what they're saying. %$* 13
that could be the case, could it not be the case? %$* 13
well, i think the important thing to point out is i get asked to give a lot of talks at medical groups, neurosurgery and other surgical groups, physician groups, because they realize the power of the medical situation. %$* 234
and i think this is what certainly grabbed me and challenged me within weeks after my coma is my knowing mybrain mind consciousness came back, and i started to review the records to reveal just how sick i was. %$* 234
i think the problem is that any other reason for being in deep coma, i probably would have been stuck because usually if there's some part of the neocortex that's still working, you could make an argument that that part was part of the process of putting it all together. %$* 234
but i think the important thing to point out is, with my neocortex so badly damaged, it became very difficult to try and come up with a way to explain how this very rich, elaborate set of memories occurred. %$* 234
so in answer to my question, there are-- %$* 13
you're arguing there really can be no other possible explanation, that you had a real experience about something that can only be real. %$* 13
well, it was a very real experience that had no way of occurring in my physical brain. %$* 234
now, initially, i looked at all kinds of possibilities; could it have happened early going in, could it have happened coming out, was there some way that other structures in the brain or some part of brain was participating and generating this very long, elaborate journey? %$* 234
and yet that's where i kept running into trouble with it. %$* 234
okay. %$* 13
let's bring it over to sean carroll then, where your opponents-- %$* 13
your opponent, eben alexander is saying that what he experienced can only be explained as a real experience. %$* 13
and sean carroll, why don't you respond to that? %$* 13
well, i think that steven can talk about the specifics that might have been going on in the brain. %$* 236
but my emphasis is on weighing two different comprehensive pictures here. %$* 236
we have personal testimony from someone who says he experienced something, and it's very real and says that, well, we can't imagine that, even as a neurosurgeon, he just doesn't know what could possibly have been going on in his brain that would make that happen, therefore let's throw out all of the laws of physics. %$* 236
and i think that that is not nearly enough. %$* 236
stop right there. %$* 13
stop right there. %$* 13
eben, is that true? %$* 13
no, that's not at all true. %$* 234
in fact, they still teach quantum mechanics, right? %$* 234

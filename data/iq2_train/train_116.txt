and your opponent is saying, you know, you can learn beautiful ideas. %$* 13
and i was an english major, and i speak english now superbly. %$* 13
it's been very practical and useful for me. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
but seriously, is there-- %$* 13
are we putting dollar and cents measurement on something that needs to be measured more broadly than that? %$* 13
well, i'm not doing that when i say that too many kid are going to college. %$* 354
i'm coming at it-- %$* 354
again, let's go back to the american dream thing. %$* 354
in 1960, which wasn't that long ago for somebody as old as i am, only eight percent of american adults had college degrees. %$* 354
so college was a big deal then. %$* 354
but 92 percent didn't, including most of the successful people in this country. %$* 354
not having a college degree had no relationship to the american dream at all at that time. %$* 354
college did have prestige. %$* 354
but you didn't look down on somebody who hadn't gone to college. %$* 354
and one of the things we don't like to say any more, but it is absolutely true, is we do now. %$* 354
if you are just a high school graduate, you are a second class citizen in this country. %$* 354
that is a kind of destruction of the american dream that i think it's becoming like a caste system where if you go not just to college but to an elite college, the doors will open and you are going to be a success, and you don't give into that-- %$* 354
but they're arguing for more people to go to college to-- %$* 13
no, i'm not. %$* 354
no, no. %$* 13
no, no. %$* 13
i'm saying they're arguing for more people to go to college, thus to presumably reduce the caste system. %$* 13
the caste system is real. %$* 354
i mean, how many people out in the audience can tell to a fare-thee-well when someone says what college they graduated from, you know very well, you go clicking through your mind, and you can place that college as to where it is in the stratification. %$* 354
the argument that your opponents have made that a bachelor's degree is meaningless, now you-- %$* 13
you meant that in the extreme. %$* 13
i'm sure you're-- %$* 13
you also said that it-- %$* 13
if that's the only bit of information you have about a person, you don't know a thing. %$* 354
okay. %$* 13
what about-- %$* 13
i want to tell you, and mostly again because i am an immigrant, and i understand the american dream more-- %$* 211
better than most americans do. %$* 211
look at the rise of america relative to its education. %$* 211
we rose-- %$* 211
you know, in the '50s and the '60s, we were coming out of the war. %$* 211
it was a different era. %$* 211
over the last 50 or 60 years, we've become "the" only world super power. %$* 211
yes, the economy is in the tank right now. %$* 211
yes, things are bad. %$* 211
we'll come out of it. %$* 211
this country keeps reinventing itself because it has smart people who can think outside the box that-- %$* 211
who can reinvent themselves over and over again. %$* 211
yes, there's some outliers who can't. %$* 211
but the average american can reinvent him or herself, and that's what makes this country what it is. %$* 211
bachelor's degrees, if we want to declare-- %$* 211
bachelor's degree is irrelevant, then let's invent something new. %$* 211
but we're not going to be able to change the system like that. %$* 211
like you said, if we outlaw bachelor's degrees, we're going to declare defeat to the rest of the world because the rest of the world has caught the american dream. %$* 211
those chinese students i talk about, they are just like my students here at duke and at berkeley are. %$* 211
they're just like the students we meet over here. %$* 211
they read the books. %$* 211
they follow us. %$* 211
they understand what we're doing. %$* 211
they want to get those bachelor's because they want to get master's, and they want to get phds. %$* 211
that's how it is. %$* 211
so forget about our vision of the american dream. %$* 211
we're now a small part of the world. %$* 211
our economy is becoming a decreasing part of the world. %$* 211
we're going to be competing like you won't believe over the next 10, 20, 30 years. %$* 211
side respond to that. %$* 13
peter thiel. %$* 13
let me just tackle this whole globalization international thing. %$* 352
so i think there obviously are a lot of things that are very admirable about india, china. %$* 352
people have a great work ethic. %$* 352
they're thinking very much about the future. %$* 352
and i do not want to at all underestimate how serious the competition is or to encourage people to be complacent. %$* 352
but the proposition we're debating today, do too many kids go-- %$* 352
are too many kids going to college, and if you look at those countries, the percentage is much smaller, and it is-- %$* 352
you know, i looked these numbers up because i figured-- %$* 352
i thought you might make this argument. %$* 352
and the u.s.-- %$* 352
there are about 40 percent of college-aged students are in college. %$* 352
and of course there are a lot of them that end up dropping out. %$* 352
it starts at more than 40.but on average, 40 percent fromr in college. %$* 352
in china, the number is 20 percent. %$* 352
in india, the number is 10 percent. %$* 352
and if you want to look at china and india, it is a brutally selective system. %$* 352
very few people can get in. %$* 352
people are worked incredibly hard once they're in college. %$* 352
and if we want to be more like them, the first thing-- %$* 352
simple approximation is you have far fewer people go to college. %$* 352
and this is true of any other country in the world you'd look at. %$* 352
and so if the u.s. should take its bearings from other countries, that is a very powerful argument for our side. %$* 352
let's bring in henry bienen. %$* 13
well, at one time, it wasn't so long ago, the united states was first in the world in post- secondary enrollment. %$* 353
and whatever post-secondary enrollments meant. %$* 353
and now we're-- %$* 353
we were 12th a few years ago. %$* 353
i think we've actually fallen to 15 to 16. if anybody thinks that's a good idea, they would think again. %$* 353
i want to add one more perspective getting back to the indians and chinese. %$* 211
yes, it's a smaller percent of the population. %$* 211
but look at the industry in which everyone is moving, technology, engineering. %$* 211
1.5 million versus about 100, 150,000 of ours. %$* 211
they're eating our lunch. %$* 211
you should-- %$* 211
you know, they have become-- %$* 211
india has become a $80 billion it industry which came out of nothing at all the last 15 years. %$* 211
how? %$* 211
by educating its people. %$* 211
zero to $80 billion in 15 years. %$* 211
but they're saying that the number of people being educated relative to the rest of the population is a tiny fraction. %$* 13
but there-- %$* 211
that's because they don't have the resources to do it. %$* 211
they're putting everything they can into education %$* 211
so if you were king of the world, would you educate everybody in india? %$* 13
would everybody go to college? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 211
i would educate everyone in the world because it uplifts society. %$* 211
what it does is it improves-- %$* 211
because the low-level jobs are going to go away. %$* 211
robotics are going to take over manufacturing in the next ten years or so. %$* 211
so those jobs which could be menial jobs that you could have non-educated people doing, they're going to disappear. %$* 211
it's become a knowledge economy where everyone has to now do intelligent things or they're unemployed. %$* 211
charles murray. %$* 13
but look at the way the caste system persists because you have good jobs which is being a lawyer or a doctor or a scientist, and then you have menial jobs. %$* 354
now, tell me where it is written that we ought to-- %$* 354
charles, you're creating a new caste system %$* 211
but let me finish my sentence. %$* 354
right. %$* 13
that we ought to think about what is more intrinsically rewarding about being a lawyer than being a cabinetmaker? %$* 354
why does that have-- %$* 354
should that have any privilege over being a cabinetmaker? %$* 354
there are a whole lot of jobs in this world which are wonderfully fulfilling that don't require a college degree and we talk about them as being vocational training. %$* 354
that is a kind of invidious caste system in education that i want to destroy by getting rid of college degrees. %$* 354
charles, which jobs are you talking about because what the other side is arguing is that those jobs are disappearing due to automation and robots, et cetera. %$* 13
wait a minute, skill jobs, listen, you want to hire a lawyer or a doctor you can do that in a nanosecond. %$* 354
you want to find good skilled labor? %$* 354
that's hard. %$* 354
finding a good plumber, a good electrician to come and fix things, that's hard. %$* 354
we have a demand for a wide variety of skills-- %$* 354
a wide variety of skills that we aren't meeting because guess what that's demeaning those occupations. %$* 354
henry bienen. %$* 13
but now, charles wants to overturn the wage structure of the world, not just the u.s., he wants to overturn the return to knowledge. %$* 353
i don't have any bias against craft skills and i agree that sometimes they're in very short supply and they get a good return, but we-- %$* 353
you know, if you believe at all in markets, i assume, charles, coming from where he comes from and with his ideas believes in markets, people pay a return to something that they think is relatively scarce or that they value in some way. %$* 353
and sometimes it's a great scientist and sometimes it's a great artist and sometimes it's a great craft person. %$* 353
but that's the way it works, so you can have a lot of complaints about college and cost but now he wants to complain about the world wage structure. %$* 353
but you can't-- %$* 18
peter thiel. %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 18
let's let peter thiel-- %$* 13
but you can't have it both ways either. %$* 352
you want to say on the one hand that college is an end in itself, it's an absolute good, we don't ask any questions about it, it's not instrumental, and on the other hand it is completely instrumental and it's what leads you to getting a better job, more high paying job. %$* 352
you cannot have it both ways. %$* 352
but the jobs-- %$* 211
one second, vivek asked you a question about your point, but-- %$* 13
i said the jobs they're talking about, the plumbers and electricians, they're less than one percent of the u.s.population. %$* 211
what about the other 99 percent? %$* 211
what do they do? %$* 211
charles murray. %$* 13
you know, one of the great television shows on tv is "dirty jobs." any of you ever seen it? %$* 354
every week they go to a dirty job but the thing is you find out a couple of things, there are a huge number of ways to make your living. %$* 354
they are interesting, they are fulfilling, the people who are doing the, you'd like to know-- %$* 354
one percent of the population-- %$* 211
it is a great curative for the kind of way we are talking about the job structure, which has nothing to do with wages, it has to do with making a living in a way that is fulfilling and satisfying. %$* 354
there's nothing wrong with doing those jobs for people who want to do them. %$* 211
the issue is how do you pick a child who gets educated or who not gets educated, you basically want to do it based on iq. %$* 211
of course i don't. %$* 354
how would you pick someone who goes to school? %$* 211
i want absolutely open competition for every position in any kind of educational institution no matter what it's teaching. %$* 354
where you got the idea i want to put iq scores on kids' foreheads-- %$* 354
look on the bell curve. %$* 211
say, "you can go to college, and you cannot," i'd like you to read a passage of anywhere that i've said that. %$* 354
charles, charles, one point that the other side did make is that education can be transformative and somebody who may not necessarily start out as a freshman seeming like a superstar signed up for a ba even of the nature that you may not find terribly useful, that the experience of going to college can cause a blossoming and that just by being there, being in the situation, somebody who wasn't very promising might turn out to have a lot of promise, what-- %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
well-- %$* 18
okay, peter thiel, you were ready with it. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
well, you know, we can find all sorts of anecdotal things. %$* 352
we were told by the other side that we shouldn't look at anecdotes like zuckerberg or gates or jobs and i agree those are exceptional cases, and there obviously are all sorts of people who have idiosyncratic things that can happen in college. %$* 352
they can also happen outside of college. %$* 352
socialization does not have to happen in college. %$* 352
people should learn how-- %$* 352
you know, this is again a really bizarre recent phenomenon, you know, 92 percent of the people did not go to college in 1960, they were able to be citizens, they were able to vote, they were able to be-- %$* 352
you know, we wouldn't say nobody should have voted in 1960 because they didn't have college degrees. %$* 352
that would have been an invidious thing to say. %$* 352
and when you say that college is a bubble, are you also arguing that colleges have a self interest in growing, that in other words, they’re signing up students to keep the tuition up? %$* 13
oh, i think there are extraordinary conflicts of interest. %$* 352
it’s like subprime mortgage brokers saying people should buy houses. %$* 352
i mean, the self dealing that is going on is incredibly severe in all of this. %$* 352
and i do think-- %$* 352
all right, i want to take that point directly-- %$* 13
all right go ahead. %$* 13
one other-- %$* 352
one last point. %$* 352
i don’t think you can separate the question entirely from the cost question. %$* 352
and so it’s like saying, you know, “mrs. %$* 352
lincoln, besides that, how’d you like the play? %$* 352
” so besides the fact that college costs you an arm and a leg, how much do you like it? %$* 352
and these two things are linked together. %$* 352
henry bienen, having quintupled northwestern’s endowment, the point made from the other side is that you had a conflict of interest, not you personally but people in your profession have conflict of interest in inducing students to continue coming to school because of the revenue that flows in as a result. %$* 13
well, we-- %$* 353
well, first of all, northwestern, i can tell you, the full-- %$* 353
if you are a full tuition payer and you had no financial aid at all, you are paying about 60, 65 percent of the total cost of the university, and it leaves out a lot of other things that universities do, which lead to higher costs, some of which i approve of and some of which i don’t. %$* 353
but we’re the research generators of the world in american universities today. %$* 353
bell labs is gone. %$* 353
the big pharmas have offshored their research. %$* 353
we’ve adopted those costs. %$* 353
now, not every university is a research university. %$* 353
it’s not a northwestern or a duke or a stanford, but i want to speak to the question of cost directly since our opponents, though i don’t think it’s the subject of the debate. %$* 353
but you know, we don’t have to induce anybody to come to northwestern. %$* 353
we get 33,000, 34,000 applicants for something like an entering class of 2,000 students. %$* 353
so-- %$* 353
and that is true of the elite universities. %$* 353
not all universities look like that. %$* 353
that’s true. %$* 353
and there is this range of places, which we’ve tried to talk about. %$* 353
if you believe in demand at all, people are still voting with their feet. %$* 353
and by the way, it’s foreigners who are voting with their feet because they want to come to american universities for the ph.d.level. %$* 353
we’ve talked about undergraduate education a lot. %$* 353
but there’s something else that universities do out there, or at least certain kinds of universities which are very, very important. %$* 353
it’s a very important function for the place that i-- %$* 353
and response for this side? %$* 13
if not, i’ll move onto something else. %$* 13
okay, i was curious to know, for you to paint a picture of, again, if you were kind of the world and these ba programs were shut down or, at the very least, people were discouraged from going to them, heard your message and stopped going, how many people would be left in college? %$* 13
what percentage? %$* 13
and where would they be going to school? %$* 13
in my ideal world, the college campuses would be more full of students than ever, but they wouldn’t be there for four years. %$* 18
somebody once want to go into business, so they have some marketing courses they want to take and some business administration and accounting courses. %$* 18
takes them a year and a half. %$* 18
and they finish all the courses they want to take, and then there is a good certification exam, like the cpa exam for accountants. %$* 18
they take that exam, which doesn’t have to consist of just filling in dots and circles. %$* 18
it can be work samples. %$* 18
it can be a variety of things, but you can take that to the employer and say, “here’s what i know academically about business.” %$* 18
do you two sides on this issue, that-- %$* 13
because it sounds to me that when you’re defining this motion as being about a variety of forms of school and education-- %$* 13
college-- %$* 211
community college is college. %$* 211
and charles is also talking about a variety of forms of education, it sounds to me as though there’s common grounds on this or you’re just coming at it from different-- %$* 13
some common ground. %$* 353
i’m not so willing to consign the b.a.four-year to the dustbin of history, as charles is. %$* 353
but i don’t think everything will or should stay the same. %$* 353
i don’t disagree with that. %$* 353
i don’t believe-- %$* 353
for example, take distance learning. %$* 353
i suspect we’re probably on the same page. %$* 353
i think you’re going to see more distance learning, even at the major four-year universities. %$* 353
it’s going to happen. %$* 353
people can take a statistics course online. %$* 353
i’m chairman of the board of a company called ithaca harbors where we’re doing research on how people learn online. %$* 353
maybe they learn statistics online as well as being in a classroom. %$* 353
maybe they can even do econ 101 like that. %$* 353
i don’t know. %$* 353
we’ll see. %$* 353
i’m for experimenting. %$* 353
our law school went from everybody in a three-year law school program to some people in a two-year program. %$* 353
i think the great universities will change. %$* 353
they should change. %$* 353
not everybody has to be in a bricks-and- mortar place. %$* 353
online, for-profits, can be solely online or 70 percent online courses. %$* 353
so we ought to think about this in a flexible way. %$* 353
i don’t disagree with charles and peter on that. %$* 353
i think we can close down the discussion. %$* 354
charles murray. %$* 13
all i’m asking is we don’t put kids in the straightjacket of the ba and we enable them to get certifications that show what they know even if it's-- %$* 354
even if they'd done it all online and that the b.a. loses its mystique. %$* 354
but your-- %$* 13
your partner. %$* 13
your partner, peter, spices the argument with-- %$* 13
by coming at it from a completely different direction which is talking about the experience of college actually being a waste of great talent as opposed to a resting place for the mediocre. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 352
i think what charles and i-- %$* 352
what charles and i agree on very much is that there is no one size fits all approach. %$* 352
there are certain skilled people, very talented people. %$* 352
not every talented person should go to harvard. %$* 352
you know, there are a lot of different kinds of things different people should do. %$* 352
and i think that's-- %$* 352
that's sort of a basic starting point. %$* 352
we don't believe there is a single straight jacket. %$* 352
and the crazy thing in our society is that the more talented you are, the narrower the straight jacket has become. %$* 352
this is a very, very bizarre feature of it. %$* 352
we also agree that learning is generally a very good thing. %$* 352
and we agree that we should be-- %$* 352
i think we all four of us agree on that. %$* 352
but there's a bit of a disagreement that i don't want to understate, is that a great deal of what masquerades as learning is nothing more than credentialing. %$* 352
and the basic numbers i've seen is that it's something like 90 percent credentialing, 10 percent learning if you try to sort of break the numbers out. %$* 352
if you got into harvard versus finishing high school, let's say you make 30,000 a year in-- %$* 352
out of high school, 60,000 a year out of harvard. %$* 352
let's say it's two to one, something in that ballpark. %$* 352
you get to 45,000, if you were good enough to get into harvard, that's the selection. %$* 352
and you get to 57,000 people knew you got into harvard, that's the signaling. %$* 352
so 90 percent is credentialing. %$* 352
and the learning gets you from 57 to 60.we're in favor of that 10 percent. %$* 352
but it is outrageous how it's been conflated with this credential which is being parasitically charged to people in this-- %$* 352
way costs have escalated and escalated and escalated. %$* 352
all right. %$* 13
peter thiel, thank you very much. %$* 13
we're going to take a break. %$* 13
and when we come back, we're going to go to questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
so i'm going to do my little bit of radio here. %$* 13
this is one of those moments when i need you to very spontaneously applaud when i-- %$* 13
exactly when i tell you to. %$* 13
and i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to say a line or so, and then i'm going to-- %$* 13
then i'm going to say the line again without the applause to give the radio editors a chance to make an editing decision on how to do that. %$* 13
so when i raise my right hand, you can just do a round of applause like before, please. %$* 13
our motion is too many kids go to college. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we are in chicago. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing out this motion, and now we're going to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
and i'm going to do that one more time without the applause. %$* 13
our motion is too many kids go to college. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s. we are in chicago. %$* 13
and now we're going to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
so if you can raise your hand, a mic will come to you, and i want to encourage you to-- %$* 13
to-- %$* 13
right down in the front will be first-- %$* 13
to really think in terms of a question that moves us along on this motion and that is terse. %$* 13
no two-parters. %$* 13
and have some phrases so it really is a question. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
ma'am, can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
oh, and if you hold-- %$* 13
it's already turned on. %$* 13
hello? %$* 355
can you hear me? %$* 355
and if you hold the mic about a fist's distance from your mouth, the radio broadcast will hear it fine. %$* 13
hi. %$* 355
katherine nvadaren professor of international political economy and expert on asian entrepreneurship from depaul university. %$* 355
i enjoyed this talk quite a lot. %$* 355
i'm an alum of northwestern, so it's a great pleasure to see dr. %$* 355
bienen who was the president while i was a doctoral candidate there. %$* 355
it's a great pleasure to be with all of you tonight. %$* 355
my question is something that has not come up in the debate, and that is social networks. %$* 355
i do analysis of high-tech gazelles all over the world, and i find that the social networks that individual entrepreneurs obtain while they are in the k through 16 pipeline, particularly while they're at universities and/or graduate schools are absolutely critical for them getting, one, trusting business partners, their first business partners, and two, angel investments. %$* 355
so i'd like for both sides to comment on the quality of the social networks that you get while you're in university. %$* 355
peter thiel. %$* 13
well, i think-- %$* 352
i think the social networks are quite valuable. %$* 352
it's-- %$* 352
it's not clear people should be-- %$* 352
it's still not clear that it justifies the college's paying-- %$* 352
charging a quarter million. %$* 352
i think the social networks tend to be the most valuable only at the elite colleges. %$* 352
once you go below that level, they actually function in a way where people, again, do not have access. %$* 352
so i think you have a very ambiguous aspect-- %$* 352
aspect about how it works. %$* 352
in practice, in silicon valley, most of the companies do get started by people who are a few years out of college. %$* 352
and i tend to think that when i started paypal, there were some people i brought in from stanford, but you know, i started with a colleague who, we met in a different social context in silicon valley. %$* 352
and we'd gone to different schools, so it ended up being somewhat-- %$* 352
my own experience was different. %$* 352
but i think-- %$* 352
you know, i do-- %$* 352
i do think elite colleges have a social networking value. %$* 352
it's very-- %$* 352
that's a very oddly different thing from what we've heard here. %$* 352
that's very different from that's about learning, that it's about turning people into citizens or anything like that. %$* 352
and it seems to me that even if that's true, it should cost way, way less. %$* 352
vivek? %$* 13
you know, not just elite colleges. %$* 211
peter keeps talking about a quarter million dollars. %$* 211
that's stanford. %$* 211
the rest of america is not stanford. %$* 211
most colleges are much, much cheaper. %$* 211
and the direction the students have are the same. %$* 211
it's not that the elite, you know, students at stanford have a big advantage over the others. %$* 211
it's just that they happen to have gone to a nicer campus. %$* 211
so the social network is equally important no matter where you go. %$* 211
now, the other thing is that if you don't go to college, if you drop-- %$* 211
forget about dropping out. %$* 211
if you went directly from high school to work, you're going to have a very junior position in some big company or some startup where you have very limited interaction with anyone else. %$* 211
you're not going to build a social skills. %$* 211
you're not going to have a network greater than the handful of people that you happen to work with in your department. %$* 211
i don't know how many of you worked in big companies or any companies. %$* 211
but it's always to people you're exposed to. %$* 211
when you're in college, you're interacting with lots and lots of people all across the board. %$* 211
it's those interactions that define you. %$* 211
they can't be quantified. %$* 211
but that's what carries you through your whole life. %$* 211
you get to meet diverse people. %$* 211
it's not just people who happen to work in the same field and the same company that you do. %$* 211
so the kids that are dropping out and starting their own startups, they're going to be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. %$* 211
i don't know what they're going to be 30 years from now because they haven't had that social interaction which defines human beings. %$* 211
we need that. %$* 211
we need that extra three or four years where you get to stabilize and learn and become who you are and decide what you want to be when you grow up. %$* 211
peter-- %$* 18
you don't know that going into college. %$* 211
peter, did you say earlier that-- %$* 13
that if you were to do it all over again, you would still go to stanford. %$* 13
and can you take 20 seconds to explain why, and why you don't feel that the time you spent getting your-- %$* 13
on a graduate degree was a drag on your-- %$* 13
on your other-- %$* 13
other energies. %$* 13
well, i didn't know what else to do. %$* 352
and i think i probably would not have known what else to do. %$* 352
in some ways, i was probably a candidate for a good general liberal arts humanities education in many ways. %$* 352
i was really interested in learning. %$* 352
i was very interested in these things on their terms. %$* 352
i don't think most people are like me. %$* 352
i think a lot of people are at a different-- %$* 352
at a different place. %$* 352
peter, they are like you. %$* 211
they are like you. %$* 211
they don't know what they want to be. %$* 211
it's-- %$* 352
i don't think people are identical. %$* 352
i think this is like-- %$* 352
this is-- %$* 352
they're not as smart as you, but they are like you. %$* 211
i tell you. %$* 211
i know that this is a big philosophical disagreement we have. %$* 352
we should not understate. %$* 352
i don't think everybody is cut from the same cloth. %$* 352
people are actually different. %$* 352
and we need to acknowledge the diversity that exists in our world and we shouldn't pretend that everybody is the same and everybody should do the same thing. %$* 352
peter, you didn't know what you wanted to be when you were young. %$* 211
most children don't know. %$* 211
they're muddling through it. %$* 211
they-- %$* 211
they learn by interacting with other people and getting ideas from other students who have diverse backgrounds. %$* 211
that's how they decide what they're going to be. %$* 211
but-- %$* 352
but, i think-- %$* 352
i think the-- %$* 352
i think that-- %$* 352
i think that most-- %$* 352
i think that there are a lot of people already in high school who were not academically motivated. %$* 352
and i can say that even if they do not know what they wanted to do professionally or work wise, you could say they weren't particularly interested in reading books and learning. %$* 352
and this was not their talent. %$* 352
that's not what they were psyched to do. %$* 352
and there is something crazy about saying everyone has to be locked into a room and read books and-- %$* 352
and that's what we have to do. %$* 352
you made that point very forcefully, i just want to go to another question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
you've got a black book in your left hand. %$* 13
if you raise it, a microphone will find you. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
hi. %$* 356
my name is jeff nelson, and i actually run a college readiness and first assistance program here in chicago that takes low-income kids to and through colleges. %$* 356
and amazingly, though, i've actually been appreciating some of the comments that are coming out of this table. %$* 356
i do-- %$* 356
by this table, you mean the side that's arguing that too many kids go to college. %$* 13
correct. %$* 356
okay. %$* 13
what i did agree with is that i share a frustration with higher ed, and i think there is a distortion. %$* 356
but i think the solution is unfounded. %$* 356
i don't think the solution is actually that you should deter kids from actually going to college. %$* 356
i think your frustration comes from the fact that there are fundamental reforms that need to be made to higher education. %$* 356
in my opinion, it should in some way mirror the reforms that are happening in charter schools. %$* 356
could you bring this around to a question? %$* 13
i will get to a question. %$* 356
thanks. %$* 13
so-- %$* 356
but i mean now. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
so-- %$* 356
so the question is, do you think there are fundamental reforms that could be made to higher education that would sway you to want to have more kids actually stay in college? %$* 356
do you mean the four-year classic-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 356
yes. %$* 13
yeah, i think that certifications as a replacement for the b.a. is the way to go. %$* 18
and i think there are a lot of market forces working in that direction because the b.a.really is meaningless. %$* 18
and employers do know that it tells them extremely little. %$* 18
whereas if they could get some strong indication that the kid sitting in front of them has actually learned something about things that are relevant to the job they're going to have, that would be good for them. %$* 18
and it would level the playing field. %$* 18
let me repeat, i do not see our college campuses having fewer people on them, i see it having as many or more but not locked into the b.a. straightjacket. %$* 18
we're being streamed live on slate.com. %$* 13
slate.com is our media partner and we had people submit questions actually beforehand once they knew what the topic was, and i just want to read one of those questions here. %$* 13
from minneapolis, minnesota, a rob arbow asks if fewer people go to college, actually he said if less people go to college, but i'm an english major so-- %$* 13
sorry, sorry, rob arbow, but he said if fewer people go to college, shouldn't the value of a college degree go up? %$* 13
charles murray. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 354
if fewer people go to college, shouldn't the value of a college degree go up? %$* 13
no. %$* 354
it's because of the college degree, you may have heard me say this, doesn't mean anything. %$* 354
if you say, "oh, well, if you have a classical education and that becomes the standard of what goes into a b.a. and you can be confident that's what a kid has gotten when they have a b.a., then you'd have a very different kind of value associated with a b.a., but it doesn't happen right now. %$* 354
okay. %$* 13
oh, henry bienen. %$* 13
if we have fewer people who go to college, the premium of wages will go up in china and india and brazil and turkey where the jobs will go, and those folks will benefit. %$* 353
you know, i'm reminded of the onion which had a suggested solution for the recession in the u.s.was just to give everybody another degree. %$* 18
and i think we have to think we can't just mechanically say, "you go to college, you get a b.a."it is, "what are you learning? %$* 18
what are the specifics? %$* 18
" you have to be focused much more on the detail-- %$* 18
no, i wanted to take to you, henry bienen, the question that-- %$* 13
peter's opening point is that, that is kind of the default position in society, increasing more so, certainly more than 45 years ago, that it is-- %$* 13
if you're anywhere close to middleclass or aspiring to the middleclass it is an automatic, "i have to go to college," without a whole much great deal of the sort of weighing of other options that this team is talking about. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
is it too much of the default's position? %$* 13
well, i think one of the problems in the u.s., and i said this earlier, is that we haven't had a lot of other good options. %$* 353
so i'm not against having vocational streams in high schools, for example westinghouse high school here, a relatively new high school, is an interesting place. %$* 353
it has both a high performance stream and a vocational stream. %$* 353
see, mr. %$* 353
mayor, you send me to these places, i try to learn something about them. %$* 353
so that's okay with me. %$* 353
i'm not against that. %$* 353
i'm not against for more on the job training. %$* 353
only 10 percent of our labor force has what the swiss and the germans would call on the job training. %$* 353
i'm not against that. %$* 353
americans have decided they didn't want to go in that direction, they didn't want to stream the kids in high school really early. %$* 353
but i think if-- %$* 353
it's not a terrible option at least to open it up. %$* 353
there's a question down in the front room. %$* 13
you have a mic? %$* 13
yes. %$* 357
okay. %$* 13
hi, i'm jessica posener my question is that it seems to me that in the-- %$* 357
with the invention of the internet, technology, globalization, there seems to be less and less a concrete set of skills that people need to be successful in the world. %$* 357
there's much more like what a liberal arts education i think maybe focuses on developing critical thinking skills. %$* 357
and so how would a shift from a liberal arts or sort of a more a broader education to more concrete courses, focus on a very specific skill set, change the ability of our society to innovate and to continue to respond to changing demands? %$* 357

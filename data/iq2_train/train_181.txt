i’d like to introduce robert rosenkranz, chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of intelligence squared, who will frame tonight’s debate. %$* 494
thank you, morley. %$* 1
and thank all of you for braving the rather forbidding elements tonight. %$* 1
with me is dana wolfe, our executive producer. %$* 1
well, tonight’s debate reflects what will almost certainly be a major theme in the upcoming presidential election, particularly if barack obama’s momentum and fundraising prowess carry him to the democratic nomination. %$* 1
we can expect campaigns that reflect stark differences in views about america’s military engagement with the world. %$* 1
each of rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- these views has a long political pedigree – antecedents ranging from jeffersonian isolationism, hamilton’s economic liberalism, jackson’s muscular populism and wilson’s humanitarian idealism. %$* 1
each would come to very different conclusions on tonight’s resolution. %$* 1
among the arguments that america should be the world’s policeman are: who else will protect the peaceful from the ruthless, especially the ruthlessness of islamic radicalism. %$* 1
who else will cope with nuclear proliferation or threats to the world oil supply. %$* 1
the u.n.has proven useless. %$* 1
nato is too unwieldy and has under-invested in its militaries for decades. %$* 1
only the u.s. has the capability to lead and to act. %$* 1
the counter-argument is that no single nation is fit for the role of global policeman – certainly not an over-stretched and economically challenged america, an america with a deeply flawed intelligence operation, ineffective public diplomacy and only a superficial understanding of other cultures. %$* 1
police are viewed skeptically and for good reason, particularly if there are no international institutions to check their power. %$* 1
we need a multilateral approach for legitimacy and to be successful. %$* 1
so these are the two arguments that are going to be elaborated on by a wonderful panel of speakers that i’m particularly proud of. %$* 1
and i’m pleased to turn the evening over now to our moderator, morley safer. %$* 1
morley has received many awards for his long and rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- distinguished career in broadcast journalism. %$* 1
he’s been a correspondent on 60 minutes for cbs since 1970.so this is his thirty-eighth year on the show this season. %$* 1
morley, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you, bob. %$* 494
i’d like to welcome you to the seventh debate of the second intelligence squared u.s.series. %$* 494
the resolution being debated tonight is: america should be the world’s policeman. %$* 494
and let me give you a brief run down of the rules of the game. %$* 494
members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument. %$* 494
presentations are limited to seven minutes. %$* 494
when opening arguments are complete i will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 494
after the q&a each debater will make a final two minute summation. %$* 494
and finally, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat and i will announce your decision on which side carried the day. %$* 494
let’s start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 494
you should have one of these. %$* 494
pick it up. %$* 494
it should be attached to the armrest on your left. %$* 494
and for audience members sitting along the aisle, to my right, your keypad is attached to the armrest on your right side next to your neighbor’s. %$* 494
again, tonight’s resolution is: america should be the world’s policeman. %$* 494
after my prompt please press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion or three if you’re undecided. %$* 494
you may rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- begin voting now. %$* 494
everyone voted? %$* 494
okay, i will announce the result of your vote later on in the evening. %$* 494
i’d now, now like to introduce the panel, and please hold your applause until all six are introduced. %$* 494
for the motion, a fellow in national security studies at the council on foreign relations, max boot, professor of american foreign policy at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies, michael mandelbaum, and author, commentator and director of the centre for social cohesion, douglas murray. %$* 494
and to my left, against the motion, president and founder of the eurasia group, ian bremmer, president and ceo of the henry l.stimson center ellen laipson, and writer for the times of london and the spectator, then broadcaster for the bbc and a former british member of parliament, matthew parris. %$* 494
we will start with max boot voting for the motion. %$* 494
thank you very much. %$* 89
and first i’d like to thank bob and alexandra and dana for the terrific job they’ve done in turning this debate series into reality. %$* 89
and i’d like to thank all of you for showing up on such a miserable evening to hear a debate about what i do think is one of the most important issues that we could possibly talk about. %$* 89
no doubt many of you are asking yourselves tonight, why should america take on the thankless task of policing the globe. %$* 89
to answer that question, start by rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- asking, does the world need a policeman. %$* 89
that’s like asking whether new york city needs a police force. %$* 89
as long as evil exists, someone will have to protect peaceful people from predators. %$* 89
the international system is no different in this regard from your own neighborhood, except that predators abroad are far more dangerous than ordinary robbers, rapists and murderers. %$* 89
they are, if given half a chance, mass robbers, mass rapists, mass murderers. %$* 89
without an effective police force the world community would fall apart faster, and more completely than new york city did in the 1970s. %$* 89
there are to be sure lots of international laws on the books prohibiting genocide, landmines, biological weapons and other nasty things. %$* 89
but without enforcement mechanisms they are as worthless as the kellogg-briand pact, which outlawed war as an instrument of national policy, 11 years before the vermacht rolled into poland. %$* 89
the hope of idealistic liberals for more than a century has been that some international organization would punish the wicked. %$* 89
but the league of nations was a dismal failure, and the un is not much better. %$* 89
the best multilateral alternative is probably nato.but from bosnia to afghanistan we have seen time and again that nato has trouble acting effectively. %$* 89
in fact five retired nato generals have just issued a report that bemoans the absence of a properly defined political rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- objective, the absence of an integrated strategy to achieve that objective, and the absence of capabilities to implement the strategy. %$* 89
now that doesn’t mean we should abandon nato.it does mean we should have no illusions that its european members can fend for themselves. %$* 89
so who does that leave to be the world’s policeman. %$* 89
belgium, bolivia, burkina faso, bangladesh? %$* 89
i think the answer’s pretty obvious. %$* 89
it’s the country with the most vibrant economy, the most fervent devotion to liberty, and the most powerful military. %$* 89
in the 19th century, great britain battled enemies of all mankind such as slave traders and pirates, preserved the balance of power on the continent, and kept the world’s seas open to commerce. %$* 89
today the only nation that can play an equivalent role is the united states of america. %$* 89
allies will be needed, but america is, as madeline albright said, the indispensable nation. %$* 89
now skeptics will reply that america has an isolationist past, and no desire to past globo-cop. %$* 89
but rumors of american isolationism are greatly exaggerated. %$* 89
since the earliest days of the republic american traders, missionaries and soldiers have penetrated the farthest corners of the world, and they have a long history of upholding civilized norms. %$* 89
i am reminded in fact of the words spoken 104 years ago, by a great new yorker. %$* 89
he said, “chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. %$* 89
and in the western hemisphere, the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.” now when teddy roosevelt spoke those words, the western hemisphere was the only place where the us exercised military hegemony. %$* 89
today america exercises almost as much power everywhere around the world, as we once had only the caribbean. %$* 89
in fact we have more power than any other state in history. %$* 89
thus, by roosevelt’s logic the us is obligated to defend civilization, and that is precisely what we are doing. %$* 89
that is why american troops have fought in places like bosnia, kosovo, afghanistan and iraq to up—restore the rule of law and uphold human rights. %$* 89
that is why american troops are still stationed from south korea to germany, to prevent aggression and a return of dangerous rivalries. %$* 89
that is why the us navy patrols the world’s oceans, to prevent the closing of checkpoints at— chokepoints, such as the straits of hormuz. %$* 89
and that’s why numerous agencies of the us government work to combat terrorism, and to stop the spread of weapons of mass rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- destruction. %$* 89
that is what being the world’s policeman is all about. %$* 89
of course we cannot right every wrong, nor intervene everywhere. %$* 89
we have to use prudence and judgment in the exercise of our power, something we have not always done in recent years. %$* 89
but america’s occasional missteps should not lead us to abdicate our indispensable role, any more than the nypd should stop doing its vital work, simply because cops occasionally do the wrong thing. %$* 89
on balance, the nypd still does far more good than harm, and so does the united states of america. %$* 89
in fact america has been the greatest force for good in the world in the past century. %$* 89
just think of what happened when we did not act as globo-cop. %$* 89
think of what happened in 1914, in 1939.by contrast, think of what happened when we did act as globo-cop. %$* 89
think of what happened in 1945, and 1989.american intervention made possible the defeat of nazism, and communism. %$* 89
american isolationism made possible the outbreak of two world wars. %$* 89
as these examples demonstrate, there is nothing altruistic about our globo-cop role. %$* 89
as the world’s most prosperous country, and as a country that depends for its prosperity on the free flow of people, capital and products, we are the biggest beneficiaries of the liberal international order that we safeguard. %$* 89
compared with the benefits that we gain the financial costs are trivial. %$* 89
we rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- currently spend 4% of our gpd on defense, a lot less than the average during the past four decades. %$* 89
that 4 cents on the dollar preserving international peace and stability is a bargain. %$* 89
now i imagine that the other side will claim that our international policing function makes us hated, and leads to greater violence against us. %$* 89
that is sometimes the case and i will be the first to admit it. %$* 89
but we are as often reviled for not acting, for not stopping the genocide in rwanda or darfur, for not imposing peace between the israelis and palestinians. %$* 89
and yes, there is a cost to be paid for action, as we’ve learned in iraq. %$* 89
but there is also a cost to be paid for inaction. %$* 89
during the 1990s we ignored our policing responsibilities in afghanistan. %$* 89
as the civil war raged between the taliban and the northern alliance, our leaders said in essence what britain’s leaders said in the 1930s—that there is no reason to be concerned about a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. %$* 89
well on 9-11 we found out why we should care. %$* 89
the answer can be seen a few miles from here, where the world trade center once stood. %$* 89
9-11 should’ve taught us that we cannot ignore potential peril, nor count on others to protect us. %$* 89
we must safeguard ourselves, and not simply by launching retaliatory rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- strikes after thousands, perhaps millions have perished. %$* 89
we need to play a proactive role. %$* 89
we need to police areas of unrest, and to do what we can to bring decent government to war-torn lands. %$* 89
if we fail to act, we, as the mightiest nation in the world, will pay the heaviest price. %$* 89
i therefore urge you to heed theodore roosevelt’s admonition, and to vote in favor of america exercising an international police power. %$* 89
thank you. %$* 89
one minute— %$* 494
but there is also a cost to be paid for inaction. %$* 89
during the 1990s we ignored our policing responsibilities in afghanistan. %$* 89
as the civil war raged between the taliban and the northern alliance, our leaders said in essence what britain’s leaders said in the 1930s—that there is no reason to be concerned about a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. %$* 89

we need to police areas of unrest, and to do what we can to bring decent government to war-torn lands. %$* 89
if we fail to act, we, as the mightiest nation in the world, will pay the heaviest price. %$* 89
i therefore urge you to heed theodore roosevelt’s admonition, and to vote in favor of america exercising an international police power. %$* 89
thank you. %$* 89
against the motion, we’ll begin with ian bremmer. %$* 494
no, i’m sorry, i am sorry %$* 494
okay. %$* 494
i should sure this, can’t i— %$* 494
okay? %$* 495
well, good evening, everyone, i’m not ian bremmer, i’m ellen, and i rise to oppose the notion that the us should be the world’s policeman. %$* 495
the united states indisputably has a vital role to play in world affairs, we have unique qualities for leadership. %$* 495
at present, perhaps not as a permanent state of affairs, some of this unique role is circumstantial because our only peer adversary for over half a century is no more. %$* 495
some of it is inherent in our qualities. %$* 495
the size of our country, the wealth that we enjoy, and the talent of our people. %$* 495
we can influence world affairs, both by conscious decisions that our governments make, by our society’s desire to respond to humanitarian rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- disasters, and in positions that we take in multilateral negotiations and in regional organizations. %$* 495
americans for the most part do want to be active on the world stage. %$* 495
but we can do good in the world, and we can benefit as a society, from active engagement in the world, without being the world’s policeman. %$* 495
let’s talk some definitions. %$* 495
now, i don’t know whether the organizers of this debate meant “police” in a literal sense. %$* 495
but let’s take the word “police” at three different levels. %$* 495
first would be “police” as in a demand for someone to enforce the rules, not make the rules, but enforce them. %$* 495
so who do you—when you’re in trouble, call 911, the police come. %$* 495
so that’s the kind of bottom-level, literal definition of, of policeman in this case. %$* 495
we could also think of the world’s policeman as a metaphor for a security provider in much broader dimensions. %$* 495
who sets the laws and enforces them. %$* 495
this would be a reference to the hegemonic stability system that we’ve known internationally since world war ii, that would refer to for example america’s military presence in east asia, or in the role that we played when we finally decided to topple the taliban in afghanistan. %$* 495
and then there’s a third definition that’s perhaps a little more abstract. %$* 495
“policeman” as a surrogate for any use of force, or for a rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- monopoly on the use of force, including going to war, preemptive wars, preventive wars. %$* 495
we decided saddam hussein had to go, we made the rule for ourself it wasn’t a rule for anybody else, it was just for us. %$* 495
so that’s a third definition of “the world’s policeman.” so i oppose this motion and i hope you will agree with me, for several reasons. %$* 495
first let’s take some practical reasons. %$* 495
the us is a country, not a global government. %$* 495
we have to know our limits. %$* 495
the united states should use force when it’s in our interest, just like every other country has to make existential decisions about the use of force and about war and peace. %$* 495
if we step up to the role of the world’s policeman we would be committing to act and to put our soldiers and police and our citizens in harm’s way where u.s.interests may be very modest. %$* 495
do we want to assume responsibility to go anywhere anytime? %$* 495
a second practical argument is that we can’t do it. %$* 495
and here i mean both in terms of quantity and quality. %$* 495
quantity: guess how many of the eleven thousand police who are currently deployed worldwide in u.n. operations are american? %$* 495
out of eleven thousand, two hundred and ninety-one are u.s.policemen. %$* 495
and they are in kosovo and haiti, principally. %$* 495
so the u.s.has not provided robust manpower from our police forces. %$* 495
we’ve also learned that the way we train our policemen in a federal system is not all that well suited to the requirements for police in a lot of peace operations post-conflict. %$* 495
and then let’s rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- ask literally, are we capable of doing the job? %$* 495
can we be the beat cop that max talked about? %$* 495
do we know the neighborhood? %$* 495
do we speak the language? %$* 495
do we know the culture so that we can diffuse conflict before it breaks into violence? %$* 495
i’m not so sure about that. %$* 495
it turns out that a lot of other countries, by the way, are willing to train their citizens and deploy them to be policemen in such circumstances – the south asians, the australians, the canadians and the nordics, in particular. %$* 495
a third practical reason is that i’m not sure the american people want us to play this role alone. %$* 495
there is a deep belief that the security burdens in the world need to be shared and that not all security problems affect american interests. %$* 495
we need to make choices. %$* 495
polls show that americans want to respond when there are humanitarian requirements, et cetera, but they don’t want to do it alone. %$* 495
now, i’m not going to make the cost argument because i actually don’t think it’s the most persuasive one. %$* 495
the u.s.does still contribute twenty-five percent of the u.n.’s costs to deploy forces around the world but we are behind in our dues. %$* 495
and before we criticize the u.n., i think we better decide whether the under-funding of some of the u.n.’s activities are, in fact, because we haven’t paid our, our fair share. %$* 495
second set of arguments i want to make against this motion are rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- political ones. %$* 495
and here basically it’s two arguments. %$* 495
one is an argument about today, the particular moment that we’re in. %$* 495
and another is an argument about the horizon, about the future. %$* 495
i think today we have a particular problem trying to assert that we could or should be the world’s policeman. %$* 495
we have over-used our global leadership role. %$* 495
we have abused, in a way, the, the good will of the international community by deciding that we knew better than anyone how to bring security to dangerous parts of the world. %$* 495
and it turned out we weren’t as good at it as we thought we would be. %$* 495
we have not necessarily made – at least the key, iran and afghan %$* 495
iraq and afghanistan – more secure or more stable. %$* 495
this is not the moment to reassert the policeman’s role. %$* 495
a third set of arguments – at the horizon my argument is that there is a realignment of power in the 21st century. %$* 495
other countries are rising. %$* 495
this does not mean that the united states is in decline. %$* 495
it does not mean that we’re weak. %$* 495
but other countries are rising and it’s a good moment to try to reallocate some of the responsibilities for these activities. %$* 495
i have a third, a last argument, which is a philosophical one. %$* 495
i think it would behoove american society and the long term interests of the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- american people if we would take a more nuanced and egalitarian sense of our place in the world. %$* 495
in the age of globalization we’ve benefited at least as much as everybody else. %$* 495
but we have to be, we have to start to recognize that other people are good at this game too, and that we have to have more respect for the capacity of others to contribute to the global commons. %$* 495
so what i advocate is a multilateral approach to the security needs of the international community. %$* 495
i want an integrated approach that doesn’t look just at the security aspects of some of these problems but weaves together cultural, political and economic dimensions of policy responses. %$* 495
and i want us to care a lot more about the legitimacy of how we engage internationally, particularly since, as the world becomes more democratic – %$* 495
okay, thank you very much. %$* 495
one minute. %$* 494
a third set of arguments – at the horizon my argument is that there is a realignment of power in the 21st century. %$* 495
other countries are rising. %$* 495
this does not mean that the united states is in decline. %$* 495
it does not mean that we’re weak. %$* 495
but other countries are rising and it’s a good moment to try to reallocate some of the responsibilities for these activities. %$* 495
i have a third, a last argument, which is a philosophical one. %$* 495
i think it would behoove american society and the long term interests of the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- american people if we would take a more nuanced and egalitarian sense of our place in the world. %$* 495

and i want us to care a lot more about the legitimacy of how we engage internationally, particularly since, as the world becomes more democratic – %$* 495
time is up, ms. %$* 494
laipson. %$* 494
okay, thank you very much. %$* 495
and now for the resolution, michael mandelbaum. %$* 494
thank you. %$* 496
you will observe that some of the things that i have to say overlap some of the things that max boot said. %$* 496
this is so, i daresay, not only because great minds run in the same channel, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- but also because the things on which we agree are true. %$* 496
all societies, when they become sufficiently interdependent, need governance. %$* 496
the society of states, the society of sovereign countries has reached that point. %$* 496
the international society needs governance and the united states provides it. %$* 496
the united states provides to other countries some, although not all, of the services that governments provide within the countries that they govern. %$* 496
this, as it happens, is the thesis of my 2006 book, the case for goliath: how america acts as the world’s government in the 21st century, that the organizers have very kindly provided outside this room. %$* 496
hmm. %$* 496
the united states provides order to the world, as governments must, in two ways. %$* 496
first, economic activity within countries requires a secure backdrop. %$* 496
government protects commerce and enforces contracts. %$* 496
the united states does this in the global economy. %$* 496
american military deployments and the american alliance systems assure the free flow of trade and the movement of capital across borders. %$* 496
this economic activity known as globalization, and made possible by the american role as the world’s police force, has brought benefits to hundreds of millions of people. %$* 496
second, the united states helps keep order in the world by leading the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- out of the hands of groups or individuals that would deploy them in ways antithetical to the interests not only of the united states, but of the world in general. %$* 496
the united states leads the effort at global nuclear non-proliferation. %$* 496
and in these two ways above all, the united states acts as the world’s police force. %$* 496
now, to this argument at least three objections may be made. %$* 496
and we’ve already heard one of them. %$* 496
one objection is that the united states does not carry out its policing duties as well as it should. %$* 496
as ellen laipson said, the united states is not present everywhere and doesn’t act perfectly. %$* 496
and this is certainly true, but neither does any police force. %$* 496
every police force is subject to criticism, legitimate criticism. %$* 496
but criticizing a police force is not the same thing as arguing that there should not be one. %$* 496
a second objection to the motion is that it would be better if global policing were carried out, not by the united states, but by other countries or groups of countries or international organizations. %$* 496
now, i daresay if the proposition were put that way to the american public a majority of them might agree. %$* 496
but it is the fact, as max boot noted, that there is no other country or group of countries that is willing or able to take up the burden of global policing. %$* 496
and as for international organizations, they are far too feeble to do so, and that emphatically includes the international rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- organization to which some would like to assign the task of global policing – the one whose headquarters is located a few blocks from here – the united nations. %$* 496
so the alternative to the united states as the world’s policeman is not a better international order. %$* 496
it is more international disorder. %$* 496
well, a third objection is, what about iraq? %$* 496
well, the american military operations in iraq really have two parts. %$* 496
the first part involved removing a tyrannical government and insuring that neither it nor a tyrannical successor would possess weapons of mass destruction. %$* 496
the second part of the operation involves trying to construct a stable, decent democratic government in that country. %$* 496
the first task which falls within the purview of global policing was successfully accomplished. %$* 496
the second has not been done so successfully. %$* 496
but the second task – what’s wrongly called nation building and should be called state building – is not an example of police work. %$* 496
it’s an example of social work. %$* 496
the united states is not good at social work but it doesn’t have to be to perform as the world’s police force. %$* 496
so to oppose this motion you must believe one or both of two things. %$* 496
you must believe either that the world does not need policing or that there is some better source of global policing than the united states. %$* 496
there is, i submit, no reason to believe either. %$* 496
and i will add, by way of rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- conclusion, that there is one group of people with a keen interest in global order and extensive familiarity with the american role in the world that emphatically does not believe either proposition. %$* 496
i refer to the world’s governments. %$* 496
they could, if they chose, circumscribe or abolish altogether by banding together to oppose it, the american role as the world’s policeman. %$* 496
but they have done and shown no signs of doing any such thing. %$* 496
and the reason is that they understand and appreciate the benefits that america’s role as the global policeman confers upon their countries and on the world as a whole. %$* 496
so whatever the verdict of the people in this house, the governments of the world above all, by what they have not done, have voted in favor of this motion. %$* 496
thank you. %$* 496
against the motion, uh, matthew parris. %$* 494
ladies and gentlemen, i was touched by what max boot, max boot said about the excellence of the british empire and british imperialism in the 19th and early 20th century. %$* 497
i'm old enough – he’s not – to remember that that was not the american attitude towards british imperialism, even in the 1950s and the 1960s. %$* 497
what happens when any one nation tries to assert, coercively, its predominance over the rest of the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- world is that other nations begin to gang up against them. %$* 497
and in that case the united states was part of the group that ganged up against the british empire. %$* 497
it might be fair, it might not be fair. %$* 497
but it will always happen and it’s something to which i want to return. %$* 497
but first – and if you’ll forgive me that spirit of malice which i find rescues these occasions from the horrors of constructive debate, may, may i,-- %$* 497
i say what a privilege it, it is to find ranged, against me three of the finest minds it’s possible to locate among protagonists for a doomed cause. %$* 497
one of my fellow countrymen, douglas murray’s precocious genius – well, few on the british, the thinking british right have not heard of douglas murray’s genius. %$* 497
i have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that he has taken elements in britain quite by storm. %$* 497
one commentator praises him as the right’s answer to michael moore, god help us. %$* 497
his unkinder critics have suggested – i, i think in jest-- %$* 497
that when younger he had a brief flirtation with the baptist church. %$* 497
only on discovering that baptism by total immersion meant disappearing entirely from the public view for all of thirty seconds, made mr. %$* 497
murray relent. %$* 497
max boot appeared last year on a list of the five hundred most influential foreign policy thinkers. %$* 497
we, on this side of the debate, do not dispute mr. %$* 497
boot’s influence on foreign rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- policy thinking any more than we dispute the influence of donald rumsfeld or king george the iii. both murray and boot and michael mandelbaum, too clever for the mob on their own side, represent one of the most interesting political experiments in outsourcing ever conducted-- %$* 497
u.s.conservatism’s franchising out to experts of its higher mental faculties. %$* 497
their function, they’re a kind of priesthood, is to flatter stupider people that there exist higher arguments, smarter than they themselves can quite grasp, for things that they wanted to do anyway. %$* 497
they should be here in white robes. %$* 497
three fine fellows, then – one of them older, one of them younger, all of them prettier and all of them cleverer than the argument that they represent. %$* 497
we salute them. %$* 497
next, to the, to the argument that they represent: why must washington shun the mantle of world policeman? %$* 497
for three reasons: first, america can’t; second, america shouldn’t; and third, americans won’t embrace this role. %$* 497
we don’t debate whether belgium should police the world because the possibility does not arise nor does it for america, as ellen laipson says – not even america. %$* 497
she is more powerful than any but nowhere like more powerful than all of the nations of the world. %$* 497
the point at which the united states most closely rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- approached political hegemony – military, political and economic – was more than half a century ago. %$* 497
it was at the end of the second world war. %$* 497
since then, and despite magnificent growth in absolute terms, america has been in almost continuous relative decline. %$* 497
after the implosion of the soviet union the impression of power vacuum was just a mirage. %$* 497
it was not a vacuum. %$* 497
it was a fragmentation, as america and my own country, britain, are discovering in iraq and afghanistan, where we are hopelessly entangled in two quite undeveloped countries, both of which i visited since the occupation. %$* 497
where are the armies? %$* 497
where are the fleets? %$* 497
where are the treasure chests to finish this job, let alone embark on new coercions? %$* 497
if the predominance of america’s wealth and power in comparison with any single rival has misled some into supposing that america could out-punch all of them together, it never misled cleverer men like messrs. %$* 497
boot, mandelbaum and murray. %$* 497
they have advanced a more subtle theory that if america picked on a single miscreant nation and sorted it out by force, then mission accomplished – others would learn the lesson. %$* 497
it’s an attractive idea. %$* 497
it didn’t work – quite the reverse. %$* 497
it triggered an international up-swelling of resentment and resistance. %$* 497
this has weakened america’s greatest resource – good will, her powers of persuasion. %$* 497
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- maybe you think the world is judging america unfairly. %$* 497
i, i think the world judged imperial britain unfairly. %$* 497
but ask why that happens, why that always happen. %$* 497
and if you want to know the answer, ask how americans would feel if the boot – max will forgive me – were not on the american foot. %$* 497
of all people, americans should know that a policeman implements laws made by and for the people that he polices, under a government whose legitimacy derives from its being their own. %$* 497
police other nations and there will be no such assumed legitimacy. %$* 497
without acquiescence you can only impose. %$* 497
america does not have the brute power to impose, nor the right. %$* 497
i said that not only can america not police the world but that she should not. %$* 497
with whatever good will you set out with – %$* 497
on your policeman’s beat, your decisions must in the end take account of your own interest. %$* 497
how can it be otherwise? %$* 497
faced with a conflict between the interests of the american people and anywhere else in the world, how can a democrat believe that washington can or would stand blindfold in disinterested judgment between the two? %$* 497
we act, in the end, in our own interests. %$* 497
finally, i said that america won’t police the world. %$* 497
i rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- don’t believe it is the will of the american people. %$* 497
i’m not a narrow horizon englander. %$* 497
i was born in africa, schooled in cyprus, zimbabwe. %$* 497
my family lived for five years in jamaica. %$* 497
i was at school in swaziland and for two years at yale university. %$* 497
i know a bit about america and americans. %$* 497
and i think there’s something different about you. %$* 497
i think that even if you could police the world, i don’t think that americans want to police the world. %$* 497
i don’t think that americans are isolationist. %$* 497
i think that on occasions america has to intervene abroad, has to respond, has to defend herself. %$* 497
but i think it’s in the instincts of the american people to demand of their statesmen that reasons are given for that. %$* 497
there will never be a long, longstanding will among the american people for international intervention. %$* 497
curiously enough, i %$* 497
may i just finish my sentence? %$* 497
though you think your argument faces a tough test before an audience of internationalist new yorkers, it’s out there in the sticks, among the right, where it will finally flounder. %$* 497
i know rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- those people. %$* 497
i represented them in england. %$* 497
they are conservatives. %$* 497
you, max, douglas and your cartload of doctrine and theory, are not. %$* 497
i beg to oppose the motion. %$* 497
one minute. %$* 494
on your policeman’s beat, your decisions must in the end take account of your own interest. %$* 497

curiously enough, i %$* 497
please wrap it up mr. %$* 494
parris. %$* 494
may i just finish my sentence? %$* 497
sentence. %$* 494
though you think your argument faces a tough test before an audience of internationalist new yorkers, it’s out there in the sticks, among the right, where it will finally flounder. %$* 497

you, max, douglas and your cartload of doctrine and theory, are not. %$* 497
i beg to oppose the motion. %$* 497
thank you. %$* 494
before we continue, i—i have a question or two for each side here. %$* 494
max boot, you make the case %$* 494
that the alternative to unilateralism, is isolation. %$* 494
whatever happened to diplomacy? %$* 494
if i gave you the impression that %$* 89
the alternatives are either unilateralism or isolationism i—that’s, that’s false, and in fact i tried very hard not to give that impression because what i talked about was not necessary unilateralism, it was american global leadership, and as i said, we should try to act with allies wherever possible. %$* 89
we should certainly not go it alone unless it’s absolutely necessary. %$* 89
but in certain circumstances it is absolutely necessary, and even with allies we cannot simply do what the herd wants, we have to provide leadership. %$* 89
we saw in the case of bosnia for example in the early 1990s what happened when american global leadership was absent. %$* 89
and that was genocide occurring and it was only when we stepped forward and mobilized our allies in the way that a policeman might mobilize a posse that we were able to be effective, so— %$* 89
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- but the record for intervention is abominable, when you think of the intervention in vietnam. %$* 494
when we think of the intervention in cuba, i mean the list goes on and on—and, and chile. %$* 494
well, i would say to you— %$* 89
and all of those places. %$* 494
well, in the first place— %$* 89
we are—interventionists we may want to be, but inept we are. %$* 494
well, in fact i would argue that a lot of our interventions have worked out reasonably well and i think for example of world war ii or the gulf war and more importantly i think of the consequences of not in— intervening, for example the fact that we did not intervene in europe in the 1930s, i think that failure speaks for itself. %$* 89
well, in an age of atomic proliferation, “reasonably well” just isn’t good enough, i guess. %$* 494
ms. %$* 494
laipson, you talk about engagement— %$* 494

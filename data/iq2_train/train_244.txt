and what do you suggest be done? %$* 641
everybody blames everything on politics. %$* 641
does it-- %$* 641
well, the reason i think that's a relevant question is because, howard, you have made the case repeatedly, and you also, jeff, that there need to be basic changes in the way we do things. %$* 13
and mort keeps coming back saying that would be great if we could do that, but he's saying it's politically impossible. %$* 13
so that's kind of a little bit of a strike against your position if mort is right that the things you're talking about just can't be done politically. %$* 13
so can you take that on? %$* 13
you know, the things mort is talking-- %$* 246
i mean, is mort just throwing up his hands and going to go back to canada? %$* 246
the thing that mort is suggesting be done can't be done politically either as far as i can hear. %$* 246
if he has any solutions for this that are politically viable now, more politically viable than our side, please speak up, mort. %$* 246
here's your chance. %$* 13
well, i do think that the notion of changing fee for services, which i am totally in favor of, or trying to get a cap on medical tort liability, which i'm totally in favor of, i can't imagine how that's going to happen for a very long time. %$* 144
i do think we still, in the interim, can introduce some modest changes to the social security system which we've been doing since the initiation of that program. %$* 144
and they did it, as i said, in 1983.what it will take, to answer the question, is political leadership. %$* 144
and that's what we don't have and haven't had for years, who really-- %$* 144
people who really want to address this because they feel they're going to lose votes in one place or another. %$* 144
and that's the sad part if we have a system. %$* 144
in canada, for example, they're doing it very differently. %$* 144
margaret hoover. %$* 13
and-- %$* 144
and it's really working, with a different kind of political leadership, with a different kind of politicalism. %$* 144
we don't have that. %$* 144
margaret. %$* 13
margaret. %$* 13
so-- %$* 633
and we agree in many ways on what the problems are: fee for service. %$* 633
governor dean agreed with us that fee for service is a problem, though we have dramatically different ideas about how to address that. %$* 633
and i think you're right that our politics have become so polarized that you cannot simply come to the table admitting that there are going to be principal differences and figure out how to-- %$* 633
how to work it out. %$* 633
and the political game and the bomb throwing has made touching medicare or social security a third rail for anyone who tries to take it on. %$* 633
look what's happened to paul ryan who puts forth a plan that you might not like. %$* 633
but he puts down a plan that goes through the trouble of getting it scored by cvo. and the next thing we know, there's a commercial of him throwing grandma off a cliff. %$* 633
howard dean. %$* 13
that's nuts. %$* 633
well, actually, i thought that that was fairly accurate. %$* 634
no. %$* 634
i'm sorry. %$* 634
that's part of the problem. %$* 633
trying to stifle my partisan side here. %$* 634
look, i'm by nature, optimistic. %$* 634
and i agree that we can discuss for a long time what's the matter with the political leadership. %$* 634
i do think elections have a way of eventually fixing that problem. %$* 634
i think the private sector's going to do it, and i'll tell you why. %$* 634
because of the obama health care plan, which i was not a big supporter of, but which does have some good things in it, there is a real opportunity in the private sector. %$* 634
and i'll tell you what it is. %$* 634
if you have a totally vertically integrated system like kaiser, for example, or geisinger, they can now sell their product outside an insurance agency. %$* 634
when they go on the exchanges, which are going to be in place in 2014, you are now going to have people competing with insurance companies to keep prices low. %$* 634
the other great thing about this bill is the exchange is basically a transparent way of buying insurance. %$* 634
private-- %$* 634
democrats go crazy when i say this, but the truth is, small business is going to dump all their people into the exchanges. %$* 634
that is a great thing because now individuals are going to go into the marketplace and choose their own insurance with some government subsidy. %$* 634
and that is market forces at work. %$* 634
okay. %$* 13
and an integrated system will beat an insurance company every single time. %$* 634
let me go to the front row for this gentleman i passed over before. %$* 13
hello. %$* 18
my name is david, and i believe i fit into the junior generation. %$* 18
and i was just really worried about a statistic that mr. %$* 18
madrick brought up. %$* 18
he said that when i retire, so like when i'm 75 or whatever, when i qualify for social security, i will-- %$* 18
if mort and-- %$* 634
if mort and margaret get their way, you probably won't get social security when you're 75. %$* 634
all right. %$* 18
well, when i do get my social security payments, i was told that i would only get 78 percent, i believe it was, of my benefits. %$* 18
but when you subtract-- %$* 18
when you deduct basically all the expenses i would normally be paying when i'm receiving a hundred percent of my benefits, how much would i have left of that 78 percent. %$* 18
i agree with that. %$* 246
and that's why i think we do have to raise taxes and get up-- %$* 246
get it up to a hundred percent. %$* 246
i'm not sure our opponents are talking about maintaining the same level of benefits. %$* 246
i think they are talking about reducing those benefits. %$* 246
but that sort of does get to the bone of my-- %$* 13
are you talking about maintaining the same level of benefits that we have today? %$* 13
absolutely, without a question. %$* 144
nobody suggested cutting the benefits. %$* 144
frankly, if there would be any benefits cut, i would cut them for the well-to-do. %$* 144
so i would put in an income standard for that. %$* 144
but on all the other benefits, absolutely not. %$* 144
what we're trying to do is to make it possible for us to afford to continue to pay those benefits. %$* 144
and so i'm just going to go to one issue because this is a chance for me to say, even though it's not relevant. %$* 144
if bill clinton has a wonderful idea for how you deal with health insurance, private health insurance, where in most states one or two companies really dominate the entire health insurance med space %$* 144
he said, you just put in one line into their policies, mandate it, that 85 percent of the premiums they receive go to health care benefits, and the rest of it, only the rest of it can go to promotion and profits. %$* 144
and he said you would have a major improvement in that. %$* 144
well, fine. %$* 144
i'm ready to sign onto that. %$* 144
any time you-- %$* 144
when i'm president, the first appointed, canadian jewish president, i'm willing-- %$* 144
i'm willing to sign that legislation. %$* 144
just a minute. %$* 13
i want to ask-- %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
you've been shaking your head dramatically-- %$* 13
that's in the law. %$* 18
that is the law. %$* 18
it's in obama's law. %$* 18
you look very, very frustrated by things you're hearing. %$* 13
the 80 percent, not 85 percent. %$* 18
and i-- %$* 13
i want to see that unleashed in the form of a 30-second question. %$* 13
my name is roger karlback and i heard mr. %$* 642
zuckerman say he's willing to have increases in taxes, maybe doing it through the caps rather than the rates. %$* 642
and he's willing to do other things. %$* 642
but i don't know if the republican national broadcasting representative is willing to raise revenue at all so let me put it to her. %$* 642
okay. %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
can you correct your approach to margaret hoover? %$* 13
yes. %$* 643
we-- %$* 13
we like to keep it pretty civil. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
it seems to me that this intergenerational thing with the sponsor of the thing, his introduction was less impartial than it has been in the past. %$* 642
he kind of was shilling for this side. %$* 642
and i thought that wasn't right. %$* 642
okay. %$* 13
not a question. %$* 13
we're going to take one more. %$* 13
do we have time for one more? %$* 13
yeah, right behind-- %$* 13
right behind our executive producer. %$* 13
hi. %$* 644
my name is deanna oliver, i'm a student at nyu.i have a question for you, governor dean. %$* 644
in the introduction of your opening statement, you claimed that there isn't in fact a social security trust fund problem. %$* 644
however, there's a problem with political collaboration and our economical stance right now. %$* 644
so if we are to lack progress in either of those areas which both sides have agreed to, and private sectors don't act on the opportunity which you claimed in your last response, does that mean that the future of the millennials will in fact be at risk? %$* 644
i don't think so. %$* 634
and i'll tell you why. %$* 634
howard dean. %$* 13
i think the millennials are-- %$* 634
people have often asked should we have term limits in the united states senate. %$* 634
i said no, but we shouldn't allow anybody over 50 to serve in the united states senate. %$* 634
that would solve the problem. %$* 634
you guys are-- %$* 634
you've elected your first president. %$* 634
and now you're going to eventually take the reins of power. %$* 634
you are not a confrontational generation. %$* 634
you focus-- %$* 634
there's much less ideological bandwidth among your generation than there is in mine. %$* 634
and i actually think you are going to get to some solutions, which as soon as us older-- %$* 634
the political class is always the last to get it. %$* 634
and as soon as these guys pass onto someplace else with their deserved reward, you guys are going to be running the senate, and you guys are actually going to sit down across what minimal ideological lines you have and get something done. %$* 634
so this is going to get fixed. %$* 634
i'd just like to see our generation own up to it and fix it and stop yapping at each other so we'll not have to leave it up to you. %$* 634
and margaret hoover. %$* 13
i would just say, i-- %$* 633
on the one hand, i completely agree with governor dean. %$* 633
on the other hand, you're the one who just said, paul ryan pushed grandma over the cliff. %$* 633
he did. %$* 634
so you resembled-- %$* 633
but you're resembling this partisanship that is polarizing the debate and not letting us get to the solution the millennials are trying to get to. %$* 633
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we're about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
the closing statements will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate because immediately afterwards, you will vote again. %$* 13
so this is their last chance to change your mind. %$* 13
so onto round three, closing statements. %$* 13
and the first to speak against our motion, which is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future," jeff madrick, author of "the age of greed: the triumph of finance and the decline of america from 1970 to the present." %$* 13
grandma's benefits do not imperil junior's future. %$* 246
the main reason is we have so much room to raise taxes without impeding economic growth that we can handle the so- called-- %$* 246
not the so-called-- %$* 246
the social security debt-- %$* 246
what i meant was the so-called social security insolvency-- %$* 246
relatively easily. %$* 246
medicare is not a problem for 10 or 12 more years, and we do as governor dean and i think, mort zuckerman and maybe margaret agree, we have to reform that system. %$* 246
i am obliged to say something about paul ryan's plan, just because he had it scored by cbo and won some plaudits in the media does not mean it was not an extremist plan. %$* 246
meant triage. %$* 246
it meant literally triage for medicare recipients down the road. %$* 246
it meant they wouldn't get covered. %$* 246
keep one fact in mind because in the end i think what's generating our opposition's ire is that we have big deficits in america. %$* 246
if we reversed the bush tax cuts, not only on the top 250 but for everybody, we would solve the deficit problem for the next 10 years. %$* 246
the deficit, the debt in america would not rise above approximately 70 percent of gdp, these are cbo numbers, not my numbers. %$* 246
we would be in what's called primary surplus so you see how much latitude we have to take care of these problems without jeopardizing the economic growth. %$* 246
and it's economic growth that the young need because that's what creates jobs for the young, and we-- %$* 246
thank you, jeff madrick. %$* 13
fouled that up badly so far. %$* 246
thank you, your time is up. %$* 13
jeff madrick. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future," and here to summarize his position for the motion, mort zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of u.s. news and world report. %$* 13
well, just about every serious review of the benefits in broad term of entitlement programs in part because of the problems that the governor mentions which is the problems in our health care system which are much more intractable than dealing with the entitlement programs' financial problems. %$* 144
virtually everybody says "we've got to do somebody about that. %$* 144
now, the question is, if you had to make a pragmatic judgment as to what you could do about it, i have to say to you that some of the proposals that are put forth by the other side are about as likely as-- %$* 144
well, you name it, as governor dean becoming president. %$* 144
i-- %$* 144
believe me, i've been a democrat all my life. %$* 144
i would have supported him, had he got the nomination, but he did not get the nomination, and at this stage of the game he's not in that political mood but i would just say to you that these are very, very serious, serious times for us. %$* 144
this country is on the verge of losing a great deal of the economic energy that it has had, in part because of the failures of our political system. %$* 144
but we have to deal at least with those programs it seems to me that protect the elderly. %$* 144
and this is something i'm totally in favor of. %$* 144
i opposed the bush tax cuts when they came about. %$* 144
i supported reinstating the tax levels when other democratic presidents reintroduced some of the bush tax cuts. %$* 144
i didn't support that. %$* 144
but whatever it is, we've got to do something about these programs or else in fact the burdens that they are going to imply in terms of the deficit that this country is going to have to undertake in order to deal with these programs, is going to do immense damage to the very future of the people that we're talking about. %$* 144
we call him junior but i'll tell you what, whoever they are, they, their cohorts, their younger siblings, their older siblings, they're all going to pay the price and it's going to be a huge price in terms of what their future is. %$* 144
so my view is take the most, in a sense, the simplest way to solve it, even though there are other solutions, i don't disagree with that, that's much more difficult to do. %$* 144
i hope we can reform the medical system. %$* 144
we have to do that. %$* 144
thank you. %$* 13
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
your time's up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future." and here to summarize his position against this motion, howard dean, former chairman of the democratic national committee and longest serving governor of vermont. %$* 13
well, first of all, let me say we're going to take this fight to north carolina, and then we're going to michigan, and then we're going to south carolina-- %$* 634
and then we're going to-- %$* 634
oh, pardon me, excuse me. %$* 634
of all, i’m heartened by the agreement among us. %$* 634
we’ve really put up a lot of the positions that i think the four of us could sit down for four and a half hours, i bet we could solve all these problems as long as we didn’t have any problems like the senate and the presidency and the house to interfere with us, which actually means that we agree on the substance that this is a solvable problem. %$* 634
and what is standing in the way of the problem? %$* 634
is it grandma’s benefits or is it a political problem? %$* 634
the framing of the opposition who doesn’t like any kind of government is that this is a benefit problem. %$* 634
this is not a benefit problem. %$* 634
this is a governmental failure problem and an economic failure problem. %$* 634
so we have a broad agreement and some disagreement about how we can fix these problems. %$* 634
but we don’t have to go through those because there’s so much agreement here. %$* 634
the question is how are we going to fix this. %$* 634
is mort right when he says, “well, we can’t do this tomorrow”? %$* 634
we can’t do it if we rely on politicians to do it tomorrow, but the hallmark of this millennial generation is to cast aside the political process and just do it, do it locally, do it in the private sector, do it any way you can. %$* 634
so i conclude that grandma’s benefits do not endanger junior’s future. %$* 634
what endangers junior’s future is a failure of our political system to work properly, a failure of people at the top of both the economic and government field to take full responsibility for a great country. %$* 634
i have no doubt that the millennial generation will restore that greatness, but in the meantime, i think it is very important for us not to scapegoat particular groups, whether its seniors or immigrants or muslims or gays, whoever it is. %$* 634
we ought to put an end to scapegoating politics and focus on the real problem, which is how we treat each other and not grandma’s benefits. %$* 634
thank you, howard dean. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” and here to summarize her position in support of the motion, margaret hoover, author of “american individualism: how a new generation of conservatives can save the republican party.” %$* 13
so throughout our country’s history, americans have found the courage to do right by our children’s future. %$* 633
deep down, every american knows that we face a moment of truth again. %$* 633
we cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer. %$* 633
without regard to party, we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of america, to give our children and grandchildren a better life. %$* 633
our challenge is clear and inescapable. %$* 633
america cannot be great if we go broke. %$* 633
these are not my words, but the words from the preamble of president obama’s national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform. %$* 633
this is not inflammatory language from the far right. %$* 633
this was a bipartisan commission by democrat erskine bowles, republican alan simpson, appointed by democratic president obama. %$* 633
there is broad consensus that we are on a course of fiscal disaster. %$* 633
again, not inflammatory language but language that is used broadly by democrats and republicans alike, embodied by this panel, mort as a democrat and myself as a republican. %$* 633
i think governor dean has done fancy footwork by trying to make this about politicians and not about what the motion is about, which is that grandma’s benefits, which we all agree-- %$* 633
everyone on this panel agrees-- %$* 633
need to be fixed. %$* 633
and everybody has their own solutions for fixing it. %$* 633
that notion that they all need to be fixed is-- %$* 633
it confirms the motion that there is a problem with the system, that junior’s benefits are imperiled. %$* 633
so i would just say for everyone in the audience who is in their 30s or younger, we should feel real urgency to address these problems and take on these reforms because it’s about our economic future and our economic prosperity. %$* 633
so please vote with us. %$* 633
thank you, margaret hoover. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to find out which side you, our live audience here at the skirball center, feel argued best. %$* 13
our motion is "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” if you go to those keypads at your seat, it’s your chance to vote now. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, "grandma's benefits imperil-- %$* 13
do imperil junior's future,” if you feel that was the better argued side, press number one, this side. %$* 13
if you feel the other side, the side arguing against the motion, argued better, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we will lock the votes in. %$* 13
and i’ll have the results actually in about 1 minute and 18 seconds from now. %$* 13
they come very quickly. %$* 13
so that concludes the argumentation portion of the evening. %$* 13
and because i feel that all of these sides came and argued with each other so respectfully, finding common ground even as they disagreed, i think they did a terrific job. %$* 13
and i just want to congratulate them all for doing that. %$* 13
i want to acknowledge that slate magazine is our media partner, and this debate was being streamed live on slate. %$* 13
and to everybody out in slate land, thank you very much for watching and for participating in this. %$* 13
and i also want to thank the many people who got up and asked questions because i know that i set a tough standard, and it takes some guts to get up and do that. %$* 13
the questions actually were pretty good tonight and on topic. %$* 13
so congratulations to everybody who asked questions. %$* 13
so as you know, we do a series every fall and every winter and spring. %$* 13
and this year we're trying something new. %$* 13
normally we will set up these debates and the panels well in advance. %$* 13
but we left one blank spot deliberately this year, october 25th, almost to the last minute to put together a debate on a topic that was very, very much in the news and relevant. %$* 13
and we have chosen the topic. %$* 13
and it's going to be this: congress should approve obama's jobs plan. %$* 13
arguing for the motion we have cecilia rouse. %$* 13
she is a labor economist who served on the president's council of economic advisors, and her partner supporting the motion for the jobs plan is mark zandy, moody's analytics chief economist who predicts, actually, that the president's plan will add two percentage points to gdp growth and will add 1.9 million jobs. %$* 13
arguing against the plan, dan mitchell. %$* 13
he is an advocate of a flat tax and a senior fellow at the cato institute. %$* 13
and richard epstein, he's a law professor here at nyu. %$* 13
and he describes the president's plan as, "a mishmash of taxes, subsidies and regulations." and he also describes it as, "a turgid 155-page bill." so that's going to be here and have some nyu influence. %$* 13
and we hope that you'll all take part, come down for that debate on october 25th. %$* 13
if you happen to be in chicago on october 12th, we're also putting on a debate, the first time we're going to chicago for the chicago ideas week festival. %$* 13
peter thiel, the controversial cofounder of paypal who has been paying students $100,000 to drop out of college on the theory that they are wasting their time in college when they could be out building businesses as entrepreneurs. %$* 13
he's going to be headlining the debate in which the motion language actually is "too many kids go to college." so everybody get on a plane to chicago for next week. %$* 13
you have a full listing of this fall's debates in tonight's program and on our website. %$* 13
and tickets are also available for purchase. %$* 13
all of our debates, as we said before, can be heard on npr stations across the nation, including wnyc here in new york, and also it can be watched on wnet's channel 13, wliw and njtv.and you can also follow intelligence squared on twitter and make sure to become a fan on facebook. %$* 13
and you will receive a discount on future debates. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
you have heard all of the arguments. %$* 13
you have been asked to vote twice. %$* 13
the motion we were listening to: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's futures." we've asked you to vote twice, once before the debate on where you stood and again afterwards to tell us which side you feel argued best, presented the better arguments. %$* 13
and so here now are the final results of the two votes. %$* 13
before the debate, 40 percent were for the motion, 24 percent were against, and 36 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 38 percent are for the motion, that's down two percent. %$* 13
56 percent were against. %$* 13
that is up 32 percent. %$* 13
and 6 percent are undecided. %$* 13
that's down 30 percent. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion that grandma's benefits imperil junior's future carries the day. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you for me, john donvan. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

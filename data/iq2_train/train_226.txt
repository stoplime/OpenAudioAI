i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
and we have four debaters, two against two, debating this motion: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
more questions, right down front, sir. %$* 13
and this front row. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
what about the aspirational aspect of the-- %$* 18
of the spread, the inequality spread. %$* 18
in "freakonomics," steven dubnner talked about the drug dealers and how many people were in that trade because there was a chance that they might be able to get to the very top. %$* 18
and if the top is getting higher, is that becoming more aspirational and potentially improving mobility? %$* 18
does the top rung really give you something to shoot for? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
that's a really interesting question. %$* 13
let's take it to ed conard. %$* 13
would you like to take that, or your partner? %$* 13
yes. %$* 587
i think that innovation is like any game of chance; the higher the payoff, the more risk people will take. %$* 587
and so what we have seen in our economy is that as we've raised the bar for success, our most capable people at the highest end, or our highest earning people have worked harder and harder, more and more hours than the rest of the world and have taken more and more entrepreneurial risk and produced way more innovation than the rest of the world has. %$* 587
and ultimately, that's translated into a much higher growth rate. %$* 587
and so we do keep raising the bar. %$* 587
and it's not really the bar for money. %$* 587
that's not what motivates people. %$* 587
it's the status that goes along with it. %$* 587
and as the bar gets raised, you have to achieve more and more to get to the same level of status. %$* 587
and that drives our most talented people to work harder and harder and take more risks. %$* 587
and that is what everybody else needs from the most talented people. %$* 587
we need those people working hard. %$* 587
and in america, we've been able to achieve that. %$* 587
and the failure of europe and japan to duplicate our success shows how difficult it is to motivate the most talented people, to get the training that really grows the economy, to put in the hours that really grows the economy and to take the entrepreneurial risk of which 99 percent of them, more than 99 percent of them, will fail, and they'll be set back in their careers as a as a result, which is not to say these talented people won't have a career. %$* 587
they'll have a career. %$* 587
but if they spend 10 years in the garage trying to do something, and then they go back to their career, they'll be behind where everybody else was. %$* 587
nick hanauer. %$* 13
and that's what we need to do to get our economy to grow and to get more people employed at higher wages. %$* 587
nick hanauer. %$* 13
so quick audience poll with your hands, not the buttons: who thinks they work harder than their parents? %$* 586
you need to tell the radio audience what you're seeing. %$* 13
two-thirds of the room. %$* 586
do you-- %$* 586
do you think you work harder than your parents because your tax rates are lower than theirs? %$* 586
i don't think so. %$* 586
i don't think so. %$* 586
so hard work is-- %$* 586
is an extremely important thing, but it is completely uncorrelated to the tax rates we pay. %$* 586
that's the first point. %$* 586
and the second thing is-- %$* 586
and this is the most difficult thing to talk about when we talk about upward mobility and the american dream and inequality. %$* 586
and that is this: that humans are status seeking creatures. %$* 586
we are not optimizing for money. %$* 586
we are optimizing for sort of social position. %$* 586
and when you go from a world where to fly first class is to be affluent, wealthy, to a world where you have to have a $25 million falcon 2000 to be affluent, to live large, you have stretched the society apart in a way that means that 99.999 percent of the people in the society cannot live the good life. %$* 586
and i would argue-- %$* 586
you don't think that people will aspire to that? %$* 13
you think they'll be turned off by it. %$* 13
i don't think that they will aspire one iota more in the second scenario than the first. %$* 586
it's just that in the second scenario, 99.999 percent of you fail. %$* 586
and i would argue that having a society that is an arms race, that is structured to be an arms race, that no one except me and maybe a couple other people in the audience, can possibly win, is a winning solution to building a good society. %$* 586
scott winship. %$* 13
i think it's a little bit disingenuous to take a poll and say that tax rates don't affect work. %$* 588
i mean, the argument that smart people on the left that i know make about why inequality at the top has risen is because of the reagan tax cuts, right? %$* 588
the reagan tax cuts-- %$* 588
this is the argument from the left-- %$* 588
increased the rewards to bargaining. %$* 588
so i don't agree with this diagnosis. %$* 588
but the left says, because tax cuts went down, it became more advantageous for people at the top to bargain, to take risk, to work more, and that's why income concentration has risen. %$* 588
so, it's certainly not a foolish idea in economics if you ask any finance-- %$* 588
public finance person in economics. %$* 588
i would also say this: ask the 50 million adult immigrants and their children whether or not they benefited from this arms race or they were hurt by this arms race. %$* 587
he talks like a rich man, okay? %$* 587
a poor guy benefits from the fact that we are working our tails over and taking the entrepreneurial risks and grow the economy and increase prosperity. %$* 587
rich guys walk around and say, "wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't have an arms race, and i didn't have to have my, whatever it was, falcon something in order to be successful? %$* 587
" we need you to be working your tail off. %$* 587
it's the poor people that need you to be working your tail off. %$* 587
the poor people are working their tails off. %$* 586
yes. %$* 585
i didn't say-- %$* 587
i didn't say they weren't. %$* 587
but in europe and japan, they have not been able to produce the innovation and the growth and the employment that the u.s.economy has. %$* 587
it is two to three times faster. %$* 587
it's an extraordinary difference. %$* 587
do we have time for one more question? %$* 13
we've been a little short on females tonight. %$* 13
there you are. %$* 13
make it really good because i just put this whole burden on you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
well, i'm actually going to come from people on the left. %$* 19
so, for example, you mentioned the ceo pay ratio. %$* 19
i don't see how you can compare an economy that was completely manufacturing based to an economy that is information based and globalized. %$* 19
it just makes sense if you're competing on a globalized scale that the pay-- %$* 19
the ratio scale would change as well. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
and you said that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are getting poorer. %$* 19
wait, wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
i need you to put a question or a little up speak at the end of it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
sorry. %$* 19
but if the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, then why has our poverty rate declined once you include all the transfers that have been made and all that has been done? %$* 19
i think it is-- %$* 19
okay, okay. %$* 13
that was our question. %$* 13
let me address-- %$* 586
nick hanauer. %$* 13
this ceo pay first. %$* 586
so our companies are not more information based or more globalized than multinational big companies from around the world. %$* 586
but the ceo pay in the united states, which expanded tenfold, that's not true in norway. %$* 586
it's not true in australia. %$* 586
it's not true in canada. %$* 586
it's not true in germany or japan. %$* 586
they did not need to do that in order to run their companies. %$* 586
and i think that that's why, when you look at the mobility data, it's much higher in all of those places. %$* 586
ed conard. %$* 13
if you look at the ceo pay in the u.s., it has not risen relative to the .1 percent. %$* 587
the .1-- %$* 587
and 90-- %$* 587
90 percent of the people in the .1 percent can't go to their board and ask for a pay raise. %$* 587
they have to go to a customer and get them to buy something that will allow them to earn more money. %$* 587
that is not the case â€“ %$* 587
up, up, nope, that's-- %$* 13
they're a lawyer, they're a doctor, they're whatever their who has to go and increase the revenues of their business in order to get a pay raise. %$* 587
now, what's happened is they've been much more successful in the united states than they have been in other countries. %$* 587
and so as a result, the .1 percent in sweden is much lower than the income than the .1 percent in the united states. %$* 587
and therefore, it's cheaper to hire a ceo in sweden than it is in the united states. %$* 587
and if you want somebody who's in that high level of capability to run your company. %$* 587
that's the cost in the united states because of the alternatives that we have been able to create at the highest end of our wage scale. %$* 587
elise gould, did you want to respond? %$* 13
yeah, to the second part of your question, yes, transfers, absolutely, if you take transfers into account, we can reduce poverty using transfers. %$* 585
and we can show that with the data absolutely. %$* 585
and social security is the number one way that we have transferred income to the elderly and reduced poverty among the elderly. %$* 585
but i think that we want to do better. %$* 585
i think we should look-- %$* 585
if we look at wage-based poverty rates-- %$* 585
if we look at wage-based poverty rates they have actually gone up. %$* 585
so the rewards to hard work, and you talk about working long hours, the only reason why people at the bottom have seen any increase in their annual earnings is because of how many more hours those households are working, and they are working really hard to make ends meet. %$* 585
all right, i'm going to-- %$* 13
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
i don't want to get-- %$* 18
my name is byron-- %$* 18
i'd like to get a piece of the trillion dollars that nick is talking about. %$* 18
it seems to me that when you apply for a job they offer you a salary, and if it's enough you take the job. %$* 18
now, what you're saying is that if the system were as you describe it that i would-- %$* 18
and i'm-- %$* 18
i accept $40,000 as the wage that i'm willing to work for, and if you're saying that in-- %$* 18
if you're going to divvy up an extra trillion dollars, even though i'm willing to go to work for $40,000, you'll pay me $50,000, is that the way you think the system will work? %$* 18
and if you do it your way-- %$* 18
all right, that was a question. %$* 13
nick hanauer. %$* 13
- the borders, believe me, will be mowed down. %$* 18
yeah, i don't-- %$* 586
i don't think that's a fair way of characterizing it, that the extra trillion dollars is profit because corporations have more power today than workers. %$* 586
it once wasn't true. %$* 586
we had unions, and we had even better labor standards than we have today, and those have eroded. %$* 586
again, the only difference, it's not an economic difference, it's simply a power difference. %$* 586
and the question becomes, "what kind of a country do you want to have? %$* 586
do you want to have a country where a few people earn everything and most people earn nothing or do you want to have a country where most people do pretty well and everybody lives a life that includes upward mobility? %$* 586
and my argument is that we generally should prefer the latter, and that is within the scope of our choice we can do that by using policy and politics to advance a commonsense agenda. %$* 586
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is ""income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility."and remember how you voted just before the debate began. %$* 13
immediately after closing statements, which are about to begin, we'll have you vote a second time. %$* 13
and i just want to remind you about our rules. %$* 13
it's the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms that will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
here to summarize her position in support of the motion, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility," elise gould, senior economist and director of health policy research at the economic policy institute. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 585
one of the most profound pieces of research that i've encountered in my tenure as a professional economist came from an interdisciplinary group of researchers. %$* 585
they examined the brains of hundreds of young children from various economic backgrounds, beginning at birth and following them every few months until four years of age. %$* 585
and what they found is that children in poor families lagged behind the development of the frontal regions of the brain, deficits that help explain behavioral, learning, and attention problems more common among disadvantaged children. %$* 585
what's striking is that the brains of the infants looked really similar. %$* 585
you didn't see those differences at birth. %$* 585
you start seeing the separation in brain growth between the children living in poverty and the more affluent children increase over time. %$* 585
and that really implicates the environment in which they live. %$* 585
it boiled down to an elevated fight or flight response from living in a more stressful home environment, which makes them less able to learn and succeed in school. %$* 585
the researchers do note that these children are not doomed. %$* 585
with the right investments, we can survive-- %$* 585
they can survive and contribute to society to the fullest extent. %$* 585
without that, they are really wasted resources. %$* 585
it's no surprise that familiesâ€™ economic situation and particularly low levels of economic stability can wreak havoc on children's wellbeing and their success later in life. %$* 585
while the mobility research has a few years to catch up as the children born in the most unequal times grow up-- %$* 585
the pathways are clear. %$* 585
the evidence is there in black in white in those brain scans. %$* 585
the truth is that income-- %$* 585
increasing incomes for those families at the bottom of the income distribution have extraordinary consequences for children's health, educational attainment, and future earnings. %$* 585
it's not only well-founded, it's common sense. %$* 585
if the economy had delivered jobs and growing wages to all those wanting to work and work hard, children across the income distribution would have a much better chance of succeeding and attaining the american dream. %$* 585
luckily, there are steps we can take to reduce this trend, but let's not deny the facts. %$* 585
vote for increased opportunity. %$* 585
vote for the proposition. %$* 585
thank you, elise gould. %$* 13
and our proposition is income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, scott winship, the walter b. wriston fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
well, thanks, john. %$* 588
as you heard john say at the beginning of the debate, nick recently tried to convince his fellow zillionaires that income inequality has risen so much that they should fear for their safety. %$* 588
so, i'll just quote: "you show me a highly unequal society, and i'll show you a police state, or an uprising. %$* 588
there are no counter-examples. %$* 588
none. %$* 588
it's not if. %$* 588
it's when." but i can think of one example. %$* 588
it comes from emmanuel saez-- %$* 588
we cited before. %$* 588
saez tells us that the top one percent in manhattan-- %$* 588
top one percent of parents-- %$* 588
receive 54 percent of the income of all parents on this island, more than double the national figure. %$* 588
that's also much higher than in king county, washington, home to seattle and to nick hanauer. %$* 588
in king county, the top receives 25 percent of parental income. %$* 588
but the saez data indicates that in manhattan, low income children, those poorer than 75 percent of kids, typically, as adults, end up poorer than 59 percent of their peers-- %$* 588
as late 20 somethings. %$* 588
that's far too high. %$* 588
but how high do poor children rise in king county? %$* 588
they typically end up poorer than 73 percent of their peers. %$* 588
they end up right where they started out. %$* 588
the issue tonight isn't whether poverty is a problem or whether lack of upward mobility is a problem. %$* 588
as we've discussed tonight, there's a lot of consensus about both of those questions. %$* 588
the question tonight is whether rising income inequality caused those problems, whether we would reduce them by reducing income inequality. %$* 588
and as i've argued tonight, the evidence is just not there, as much as we might care about the poor and those who are stuck at the bottom. %$* 588
so, i urge you tonight to oppose the motion on the table-- %$* 588
income inequality has not impaired the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 588
thank you, scott winship. %$* 13
and that's the motion: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, nick hanauer. %$* 13
he is cofounder and partner at the venture capital firm, second avenue partners. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 586
scott, i acknowledge that in some ways, economic inequality and mobility may not be as bad as some of the data suggests. %$* 586
but i equally insist that in many ways, it is likely far worse than the data shows. %$* 586
and ed, people do, of course, need theoretical incentives. %$* 586
but even more, they need practical opportunity. %$* 586
for all of human history, wherever you have found concentrated wealth, you find its defenders and its apologists, the deniers. %$* 586
the people who put lead in paint denied it was harmful. %$* 586
the people who made cigarettes denied they gave us cancer. %$* 586
the fossil fuel industry today denies global warming. %$* 586
the packaged food industry denies that sugary soft drinks have anything to do with our epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes, and how could we not have inequality deniers? %$* 586
like clockwork, they will tell you it's not happening, or if it is, it's really, really good for the economy and for the middle class in mobility. %$* 586
inequality tonight is being sold like high fructose corn syrup. %$* 586
"yummy. %$* 586
have some more." really? %$* 586
really? %$* 586
so, we should ignore the facts and the drowning feeling a majority of middle income americans are experiencing today, as they watch the american dream recede? %$* 586
our answer to them to be-- %$* 586
should-- %$* 586
our answer to them should be, "hey, you just need to look at the data differently. %$* 586
we should believe that the young men in ferguson, missouri elected not to become software engineers or partners at bain because the theoretical incentives to take risk were not high enough."elise and i do not believe that, and we hope that you don't either. %$* 586
you don't need a phd in economics to see that extreme and rising inequality isn't just impairing the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 586
inequality is drowning it. %$* 586
thank you, nick hanauer. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion, income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this position, ed conard, a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute and former partner at bain capital. %$* 13
germany is the second most prosperous major economy in the world. %$* 587
in germany, the 99 percent earns 47 percent of gdp.in the united states, the 99 percent earns 47 percent of gdp.and that's 47 percent of a faster growing economy with median incomes that are 20 percent higher. %$* 587
with america's 1 percent earning a larger share of gdp than their counterparts in germany, how can it be the case that the 99 percent in both countries earn the same share of gdp. %$* 587
relative to germany, the additional share earned by america's 1 percent comes entirely from the investors' share of gdp, not the share earned by the 99 percent. %$* 587
so for those of you who continue to believe that the economy is a pie, please recognize that the larger share of america's 1 percent comes entirely from investors and not the 99 percent. %$* 587
with valuable on-the-job training at companies like google, and access to networks of experts like silicone valley, the productivity of america's top earnings-- %$* 587
earners is higher than the rest of the world. %$* 587
and given these advantages, it should come as no surprise that america's 1 percent creates a greater share of gdp relative to investors than their counterparts elsewhere. %$* 587
and given this advantage, it should come as no surprise that the returns to college education are significantly higher in the united states than they are in any country in the world. %$* 587
ultimately, this debate boils down to whether the outside success of america's talent is an asset or a liability for the rest of the country. %$* 587
by every measure, employment growth, median incomes, return to education and opportunities for immigration, the u.s.provides more upward mobility than any other economy, even ultimate liberal emmanuel saez agrees. %$* 587
mobility has not declined. %$* 587
and even if you believe that we ought to tax the rich more, it does not change the fact that the success of america's top earners do not impair the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 587
they improve it. %$* 587
please vote against the motion. %$* 587
thank you, ed conard. %$* 13
and that concludes round three of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seats and have you vote a second time. %$* 13
just as before, push number one if you are in support of the motion, income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
push number two if you come out against this. %$* 13
push number three if you remain or became undecided. %$* 13
and we will have the results in about a minute and a half and declare our winner. %$* 13
before we do that, i want to say it was a-- %$* 13
it was a relatively complex topic. %$* 13
the motion itself has several moving parts, and i think debaters dealt with that really well and intelligently and in a spirit of respect for one another. %$* 13
so, i want to congratulate them for the way they did this. %$* 13
a second thing i want to say, because of the complexity of the topic, i don't usually throw as many questions as i did tonight. %$* 13
and i just want to say to the people whose questions i threw out, there is no disgrace or dishonor in that. %$* 13
this is a topic where you can go off in a lot of different directions. %$* 13
and to the 18-year-old high school student, i really hate not taking your question from a high school student. %$* 13
we did a debate two years ago where the motion was "the rich are taxed enough," which really went to some of the issues that i think people wanted to get to tonight. %$* 13
and it's on our-- %$* 13
it's available through our app actually, as all of our debates are, which you can get from apple store and from the google store. %$* 13
i also want to thank-- %$* 13
take a moment and thank all of our generous supporters who have made these debates possible. %$* 13
the ticket sales do not by any means come close to covering the cost of these debates. %$* 13
so thank you to all of them and we encourage everybody else who is willing to make a visit to our website at iq2us.org and make a donation because every-- %$* 13
every gift counts for us. %$* 13
so thank you to those who are here who have been our contributors. %$* 13
our next debate will be here at the kaufman center on thursday, november 13th. %$* 13
the motion will be, on november 13th, legalize assisted suicide. %$* 13
for the motion, we have peter singer. %$* 13
he's a professor of bioethics at princeton university, often described as the world's most important living, influential living philosopher. %$* 13
his partner will be andrew solomon. %$* 13
he's an award-winning author who has written about his own mother's assisted suicide. %$* 13
against the motion, we have baroness finlay who is-- %$* 13
she's a palliative care physician whose own mother considered assisted suicide, did not, and came to regain her full desire for life, so a very powerful personal anecdote in that; and dr. %$* 13
daniel sulmasy who is a professor of medicine and ethics at the department of medicine and the divinity school at the university of chicago. %$* 13
tickets are available at our website at iq2us.org. %$* 13
and as i mentioned, we have the app. %$* 13
you can look at all of our debates are available there. %$* 13
we live stream on our website at iq2us and listen-- %$* 13
you can listen to all these debates on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, it's all in now. %$* 13
i have the final results and recall that the way we determine victory here is the team whose numbers have changed the most between your two votes in our live audience here in new york, in percentage point terms. %$* 13
so, let's see what the results are. %$* 13
the motion was this: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
before the debate, 60 percent agreed with this motion. %$* 13
14 percent were against. %$* 13
26 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, those are the first results. %$* 13
again, it's the difference between the first and second vote. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility, their second vote was 53 percent. %$* 13
they went from 60 percent down 7 percentage points to 53 percent. %$* 13
let's look at the team against the motion. %$* 13
their first vote was 14 percent. %$* 13
their second vote, 37 percent. %$* 13
they went up 23 percentage points. %$* 13
that's enough for victory by far. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility, is our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

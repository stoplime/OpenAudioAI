so, if we're going to debate law, let's debate the law as they interpreted it. %$* 238
but we're not here to debate law, because that's not why-- %$* 238
that's-- %$* 238
michael hayden. %$* 13
too easy. %$* 238
right. %$* 13
it's too easy to debate the law, because then, actually, i'm on their side. %$* 238
then i shouldn't have shown up. %$* 238
michael hayden. %$* 13
i just want to add, whatever label we put on it-- %$* 77
“war on terror” or “war against al-qaeda,” it still is the legal authority under which we operate, but against al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 77
that all we have been doing-- %$* 77
all that we have done, has been designed against that opposing armed enemy force-- %$* 77
al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 77
so, don't be confused by the labels. %$* 77
all along, despite whatever the rhetoric may have been, we used-- %$* 77
again-- %$* 77
the tools of our own conflict against a specific set of enemies, authorized by the congress of the united states. %$* 77
but do you hear your opponent saying that's as a practical matter-- %$* 13
as almost a cultural matter - - the term “war” suggests much more than the issue of a legal authorization-- %$* 13
that it does reflect a mindset, and taking a side is keeping a population in fear. %$* 13
and that charge-- %$* 13
it does reflect a mindset, a commitment to discussion over resources, a discussion over sacrifice, that talking about a war is a great deal more than the narrow legal sense that you're talking about. %$* 13
well, it can be, but you need an actionable proposition. %$* 119
i mean, you need something you actually can decide on. %$* 119
and when it's so subjective that you're talking about a mindset, it's like - - general hayden and i showed up in the same government for three years or so. %$* 119
we didn't come to work with an identical mindset. %$* 119
we came with slightly different mindsets, and he-- %$* 119
at the time-- %$* 119
was an active military officer. %$* 119
i think it had a different meaning to me then as a civilian in the white house. %$* 119
so, it's a very subjective thing. %$* 119
one of the things about this war-- %$* 119
which is different from, certainly, world war ii or vietnam-- %$* 119
is that the national security apparatus-- %$* 119
and actually a subset of it, feels like it's at war. %$* 119
still to this day. %$* 119
but the people don't. %$* 119
and that's ahistoric. %$* 119
so, it hasn't usually been that way for us. %$* 119
and i actually think that's okay in this particular case for-- %$* 119
not everyone to feel like they're walking around, feeling like they're mobilized for war-- %$* 119
but for a subset of the national security apparatus to actually act that way. %$* 119
so he's saying your definition of war is too subjective. %$* 13
he is saying that. %$* 238
yeah. %$* 238
i think that's a weird way to put the war on terror, only because what followed from calling it a war on terror-- %$* 238
which was not my language. %$* 238
i mean, that was the language of an administration that determined that after 9/11, we would conceive of it at as war. %$* 238
and it would have all sorts of implications-- %$* 238
not just legal implications, but implications for a whole range of activities, because we were going to call it a war. %$* 238
and all the-- %$* 238
so, it wasn't just a feeling. %$* 238
it was a series of procedures and policies that flowed from that. %$* 238
so let me just give you an example, because that may help-- %$* 238
what this legal debate means. %$* 238
so by deciding that it's a war on terror. %$* 238
so, that's what it is. %$* 238
this is the debate about military commissions. %$* 238
what do we mean by military commissions? %$* 238
well, if it's a war on terror, that is this thing that we can define and determine where we want to go with detainees or how we want to try or not try them. %$* 238
then, we create a whole new military commission system that, under the previous administration, got essentially overturned by the supreme court. %$* 238
and then you have to come back, right? %$* 238
and then you have to say, “what are we going to do with these detainees? %$* 238
” because it's a problem. %$* 238
we all agree it's a problem. %$* 238
and then you come back, and you work with congress, and you create a military commission-- %$* 238
which this president did-- %$* 238
which provides very strong protections for the people within the military commission system, has independent appellate review-- %$* 238
and let's just be clear, has been supported by every article iii court, every federal court in the united states. %$* 238
we're not at a constitutional crisis every day. %$* 238
we're just not there. %$* 238
so, it wasn't our language. %$* 238
it was the language of the aumf-- %$* 238
authorization for the use of military force against al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 238
wasn't our language. %$* 238
so to say now, that we're calling it a feeling seems like it's just a little bit of amnesia there, i think. %$* 238
mike hayden. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 77
i'm confused. %$* 77
are we a nation at war or not, is the question i would ask. %$* 77
and do our armed forces have the right-- %$* 77
does the president have the right to use the tools of a nation in conflict, to protect you against al-qaeda? %$* 77
we've got some commentary here about some things that were done over the last 10 years. %$* 77
and there's some criticisms-- %$* 77
or implied criticisms-- %$* 77
that some of these were overreactions, or not in the best traditions, or novel developments in american constitutional military law. %$* 77
i'm not here to debate that. %$* 77
i am here to suggest that we are not at our best when we are fearful. %$* 77
and that the degree that we are not fearful, we adhere to the best of our traditions. %$* 77
lincoln's quote about the better angels of our nature. %$* 77
we are able to do that more freely now. %$* 77
we are able to consult those better angels, because the threat is incredibly much reduced. %$* 77
and it's much reduced because those people who did those things are largely dead. %$* 77
and they're dead because we were a nation at war, and we're allowed to use the tools of a nation at war, to make them dead. %$* 77
i don't think it's time to give up that capacity-- %$* 77
to give up that authority-- %$* 77
why, michael, if they're mostly dead? %$* 13
because, peter mentioned-- %$* 77
peter mentioned-- %$* 77
because they aren't all dead. %$* 77
and peter mentioned john brennan, and leon panetta, and david petraeus giving rather rosy descriptions of al-qaeda. %$* 77
i mean, rosy from our point of view. %$* 77
they were talking about al-qaeda maimed. %$* 77
they were talking about al-qaeda in pakistan, and in the tribal region. %$* 77
they were not talking about the franchises in yemen, or in somalia, or in islamic maghreb. %$* 77
and none of them have suggested this is over. %$* 77
all of them, in fact, have called for at least the current tempo of operations. %$* 77
i have met no one who is actually responsible for creating the circumstances that make this debate possible-- %$* 77
should we end this thing? %$* 77
no one who is responsible for creating that, who actually thinks we ought to stop doing what we're doing. %$* 77
peter bergen. %$* 13
well, i'm glad that general hayden has conceded that, certainly, our principal enemies are dead. %$* 91
i mean, that's usually how you end a war, when your enemies are mostly dead. %$* 91
we didn't kill every nazi at the end of world war ii.i mean, there's a certain point. %$* 91
what we're claiming here is it's time to end the war on terror as the organizing principle of our national security policy, which by the way, cost us trillions of dollars over the past decade-- %$* 91
which has allowed us to ignore a lot of serious problems we have at home and other threats abroad. %$* 91
you know, there are a million americans now with top secret clearances. %$* 91
i don't think they all needed them. %$* 91
that is one of the legacies of defining it as a war on terror. %$* 91
and richard said that we're not debating the war on terror as it was produced by president george bush in the first four years. %$* 91
well, i mean, let's try and take that back to our side a little bit. %$* 91
the war on terror was not the war on al-qaeda and its allies. %$* 91
it was an open-ended conflict against a tactic that produced a lot of enormous problems for this country, including the iraq war and all that, the legacy we have from that. %$* 91
and so, there is sort of historical part to this. %$* 91
it's important. %$* 91
we're not just debating about what happened today. %$* 91
it's about a mindset which causes countries some serious economic problems-- %$* 91
which we are still trying to recover from. %$* 91
as i said-- %$* 119
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
maybe these debates often turn on trying to get the voters to think about the proposition in a particular way. %$* 119
and the-- %$* 119
but so are you doing it. %$* 13
yeah, that's why it's called a debate. %$* 77
but i think i read the proposition a little more closely, because you could have written it like this. %$* 119
it could have said, “should the war on terror be the central organizing principle of u.s. foreign policy? %$* 119
” you could have said that. %$* 119
i think we would have been uncomfortable on this side of the table. %$* 119
but what do you think the audience is-- %$* 13
let me ask. %$* 13
do you assume the audience sees it your way or do you think the audience-- %$* 13
well, i suggested a way to think about it. %$* 119
and as a-- %$* 119
okay. %$* 13
right. %$* 238
to make it sort of actionable. %$* 119
because as we've said, we are currently at war, in a legal sense, and we'd like to frame this proposition, saying, “should we no longer be? %$* 119
right. %$* 238
that's really what it means, “it's time to end the war on terror.” now, we could make this a referendum on how this was handled between september 11, 2001 and then the elections of 2006.or, you know, you could do that too. %$* 119
that's a different argument. %$* 119
and, you know, we're prepared to have that, but it's really not the war that we face right now today. %$* 119
and many of these issues were considered-- %$* 119
this is ironic-- %$* 119
by the obama administration. %$* 119
many of the sort of tactical issues. %$* 119
and as i said, he didn't divert anything from what bush was doing. %$* 119
in fact he intensified it-- %$* 119
the unilateral use of military force against a neutral country-- %$* 119
pakistan-- %$* 119
into their territory. %$* 119
it-- %$* 119
so. %$* 13
increased. %$* 119
so-- %$* 13
make your point, but then i want to come back to the questions. %$* 13
a couple things on what rich says. %$* 238
this argument is actually-- %$* 238
if you read it-- %$* 238
is about the war on terror. %$* 238
and it's not a referendum on the first four years of the bush administration, or the first six years, or even the first two of obama. %$* 238
it is about, what did we mean by the war on terror? %$* 238
what was that definition that was used for so many years? %$* 238
and are we ready to be over? %$* 238
and they are doing-- %$* 238
they are trying to convince you, sort of a simplistic notion here, which is-- %$* 238
for those of us who have also served in government and national security is way too simplistic, simply because you want to say that the war on terror is over does not mean that you're saying, “no military action ever.” right? %$* 238
it doesn't mean, “oh, gosh, i wish bin laden had been brought to a courtroom in new york city.” no one is saying that. %$* 238
there is authority for the president to use force, including killing bin laden, under the authorization for the use of military force. %$* 238
i support that. %$* 238
so what stops, if you declare the war on terror over, what stops happening? %$* 13
well, i think it's already over. %$* 238
so let me then-- %$* 238
that's a great question. %$* 238
because what also happened over the course of this 10 year period is that a narrative is being rewritten. %$* 238
and the narrative is that obama is exactly the same as bush. %$* 238
but bush wasn't exactly the same as bush. %$* 238
we have grown. %$* 238
and there are examples everywhere-- %$* 238
coercive interrogation, the black site-- %$* 238
all of that, we have learned. %$* 238
they learned, we learned. %$* 238
and that ability to change doesn't mean that, you know, “oh,” you know, “we're going to continue to call it the same thing.” that war ended. %$* 238
that notion that military or this war on terror was how we were going to approach it. %$* 238
it became much better. %$* 238
and can we talk about homeland security for a minute? %$* 238
but if it's ended, then why are you saying it's now time to end the war? %$* 13
because they're never going to end it. %$* 238
well-- %$* 13
right? %$* 238
the 10th anniversary is a good sign to begin to say, “let's give,”-- %$* 238
have the american public say, “we're ready to not think of our world this way.” that the war on-- %$* 238
so, maybe we should let juliette and peter argue this one out-- %$* 119
because they were not arguing the same proposition here. %$* 119
i mean, this is entirely different. %$* 119
juliette says the war on terror as we-- %$* 119
as she's defining it-- %$* 119
is already over. %$* 119
and peter says, “time to end it now, because we decimated most of the al-qaeda leadership and the ideology was defeated”-- %$* 119
completely-- %$* 238
“in the arab spring.” these are totally different propositions. %$* 119
so we're not clear-- %$* 119
they are two factual arguments to make the case. %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
right. %$* 238
which is fair-- %$* 13
which is a fair way to do it. %$* 13
but i think we hear your point. %$* 13
michael hayden. %$* 13
i return to my point, that i'm the one on stage that got the phone call in the middle of the night. %$* 77
i knew what the war was about, right? %$* 77
it's about what he said. %$* 77
it was about the authorization for the use of military force, and the ability to use combat power against al-qaeda and affiliated organizations. %$* 77
there was no confusion on my part. %$* 77
and so, i don't quite understand. %$* 77
if that's still okay, what is it we're departing from? %$* 77
well-- %$* 91
as sort of another way to look at this is that president clinton tried to kill bin laden in 1998, with cruise missile strikes. %$* 91
this is not new, the idea that we reserve to ourselves the ability to kill enemies of the state. %$* 91
well, we're just calling for an end of this all-encompassing, global conflict that has cost us so much money. %$* 91
we're not calling for a global police action against terrorists, certainly. %$* 91
we reserve the right for a certain kind of war-like activities, but it's time to stop this sort of grandiose approach, where we're at war with any person who's ever said the word “jihad” around the world, which is going to cost us a lot of money. %$* 91
peter, that's a cartoon. %$* 119
that's-- %$* 119
no one said that anymore. %$* 119
this is not the case. %$* 119
i mean, you can lambast the other side of this debate by constructing the straw man, but that's just not it. %$* 119
i mean, we're not-- %$* 119
well, is it? %$* 13
is it, peter? %$* 13
do you feel that that's still the rhetoric coming from the u.s.? %$* 13
well, i think when we say, “the war on terror,” when fdr went to war against the nazis, he didn't declare war against the sort of tactic of u-boats or kamikaze pilots, in the case of japan. %$* 91
i mean, the war on terror was a very expansive notion that pulled us into the conflicts in the iraq-- %$* 91
that we now orphaned-- %$* 91
and others. %$* 91
and that's what we're saying – it is the end of that. %$* 91
i mean, juliette is making a point that it's, in a sense, already ended. %$* 91
but also, our enemies are essentially defeated. %$* 91
and defeat doesn't mean total obliteration. %$* 91
it means that we can now move on and say, essentially, that the longest war in american history, which it is now, the longest war in american history. %$* 91
you know, there's a time-- %$* 91
a time to move on. %$* 91
all right. %$* 13
i'd like to go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
and the way we'll do this. %$* 13
i can see you, and we'll-- %$* 13
i think i explained beforehand. %$* 13
i believe everybody was here. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
we'd ask you to rise, to be terse, to make it a question, to keep it on point, and to keep the microphone about four inches away from your mouth. %$* 13
and this gentleman in the very center, if you-- %$* 13
i'm looking right at you-- %$* 13
and if you'd stand up, they'll bring a mic over to you. %$* 13
my question is-- %$* 18
i just want to get the mic over to you, so we can hear you on the radio broadcast. %$* 13
my question is to peter and juliette. %$* 27
i think the other side has defined very well what they think would be lost if the war on terror, as they define it, would be ended. %$* 27
can you explain very clearly what would be gained if the war on terror, as you define it, would be ended. %$* 27
thank you. %$* 27
could you just say that last part again? %$* 238
if the war – %$* 238
what would be gained by ending the war on terror, as you define it? %$* 27
honesty, descriptiveness, actually reflecting what's happening out there. %$* 238
i mean, whether the war on terror ended as we started to change, it's just a learning process over 10 years, to effective counterterrorism-- %$* 238
effective counterterrorism tools. %$* 238
that happened over the course of a 10 year period. %$* 238
so the reason why not to call it a war on terror is because we know what the war on terror meant. %$* 238
now, they can now claim it was just a legal device. %$* 238
but i lived that time. %$* 238
we all lived that time. %$* 238
we all served in government. %$* 238
three of us served in government during that time. %$* 238
so i've just asked people to remember, as we have been discussing, what that meant. %$* 238
it's not an indictment on everything that happened or the changes or whatever else. %$* 238
it is just simply today we have effective counterterrorism measures. %$* 238
some of them might be military, might be the use of military force as authorized by law. %$* 238
many of them will not be. %$* 238
and it's as simple as that. %$* 238
and so we can say that we didn't mean by the "war on terror" anything but there's this law. %$* 238
and that's just for you all to decide if that's what you thought it meant at that time. %$* 238
can i ask you, sir, to, first of all, if you don't mind identifying yourself. %$* 13
and then in terms of the answer, do you feel that your question was answered, that it was addressed? %$* 13
my name's philip gourevitch. %$* 27
i'm a writer. %$* 27
i was asking whether you think-- %$* 27
the issues that you're describing are a kind of broad conception of the war on terror. %$* 27
and they're defining it as a legal set of tool-- %$* 27
a toolbox. %$* 27
and you're essentially saying that you agree with them that that legal toolbox should not be abandoned. %$* 27
so i'm saying, what would you-- %$* 27
could you-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
one more time. %$* 13
could you stand? %$* 13
you don't have to repeat the question because you were about to repeat it anyway. %$* 13
okay. %$* 238
but go at it. %$* 13
you're saying that that tool-- %$* 27
are you saying-- %$* 27
you're saying that toolbox shouldn't be abandoned either. %$* 27
right. %$* 238
but the concept of the war on terror should be because of a bunch of things that you say have essentially-- %$* 27
been changed. %$* 238
not been practiced for a while so-- %$* 27
right. %$* 238
it seems like you think it should be redefined. %$* 27
and, but-- %$* 238
and there's a reason for-- %$* 238
and i'm asking what would be gained by saying "the war on terror is over," and wouldn't-- %$* 27
if you're still preserving all those legal tools-- %$* 27
right. %$* 238
that you think that they-- %$* 27
that they said that we should. %$* 27
not all of them, yeah. %$* 238
no. %$* 238
i think in answering in terms, i think more descriptive of actually what we're doing, more limited description of what counterterrorism efforts and procedures actually are. %$* 238
there's a difference between counterterrorism efforts and actions and war. %$* 238
and it's – %$* 238
i think the question might also-- %$* 13
be descriptive in that sense. %$* 238
might also be reframed as what's the harm to-- %$* 13
in continuing to call it a war on terror? %$* 13
well, then that's my-- %$* 238
i viewed the war on terror as so expansive and defining so many authorities, including a commander in chief by all-- %$* 238
any means necessary to protect us. %$* 238
that explains a 10-year or eight-year trajectory. %$* 238
i'm not going back to say, oh, look how horrible they are. %$* 238
i'm going back to say, that's what the war on terror was. %$* 238
aren't we glad that we have moved away from that? %$* 238
they moved away from it. %$* 238
we moved away from it. %$* 238
i just want to see if your opponents would like to respond. %$* 13
michael hayden. %$* 13
i talked about one dimension of expansiveness. %$* 77
you know, war on terror, whatever the rhetoric was, it was war on al-qaeda and its affiliates. %$* 77
i'm sorry to repeat myself. %$* 77
i did not have the authority to do against hezbollah and other terrorist organizations who are unaffiliated with al- qaeda and not responsible for the attack of 9/11, the authorities i had to deal with this well, clearly defined enemy. %$* 77
so the expansiveness in that dimension wasn't expansive. %$* 77
in addition, the expansiveness in this direction, what is it you could do against this enemy force, was controlled by u.s. law, by the constitution. %$* 77
but was not the invasion of iraq, which had its own authorization, also part of the war on terror as they're describing it? %$* 13
i-- %$* 77
you know, we can talk a lot about different and specific things. %$* 77
but-- %$* 13
no, no. %$* 13
but no, no. %$* 13
but mike, it-- %$* 13
i'm not debating the merits of the war on iraq at all or asking you to. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 77
or i'm not debating with you because i'm the moderator. %$* 13
i'm just trying to deliver what i heard as her point to you, which is that there is an expansiveness to the term that leads to an expansiveness of actions. %$* 13
the-- %$* 77
okay. %$* 77
so the attack on 9/11 created an environment in which the-- %$* 77
it was more likely that our government would make a decision to go to war with iraq, i think that's clear. %$* 77
okay? %$* 77
the war in iraq was not tied to the authorization for the use of military force. %$* 77
and people like me in the american intelligence community, made it very clear that there were not operational connections between the iraqi intelligence service and al-qaeda, the named enemy in the aumf. %$* 77
john, i mean, is it-- %$* 119
to your direct question, the answer is president bush and his principal officers in explaining the rationale for going to war against iraq did reference the war on terror extensively and repeatedly. %$* 119
and they were by no means unique in doing so. %$* 119
that occurred on both sides of the political aisle and may still go on today. %$* 119
now, whether that was an appropriate characterizations or not, who knows? %$* 119
but, i mean, they did. %$* 119
well, i think we do know. %$* 91
is this a debate about ending the war on iraq or ending the war on terror? %$* 77
well, they were related to each other, i mean, that's-- %$* 91
the way-- %$* 91
the way the war was sold is that it was part of the war on terror. %$* 91
that was the intellectual architecture of the war. %$* 91
again, peter, those are events of a half a decade ago or longer. %$* 77
well, we're still in iraq. %$* 91
well, yeah, we are. %$* 77
and frankly, i mean, we all have to deal with life as it is, not as we wish it would have been. %$* 77
and so we're not-- %$* 77
oh. %$* 238
and so we're not-- %$* 77
oh, "awe." come on. %$* 77
there are-- %$* 77
people who are actually responsible for things have to deal with the world as it is, not as they wish it to be. %$* 77
and that may be the actual core of the debate. %$* 77
all right. %$* 13
i'd like to go to another question. %$* 13
you know, i'm-- %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
can i just-- %$* 91
people often ask me, "why don't you call on more women? %$* 13
" because women aren't raising their hands. %$* 13
so i'd like to get-- %$* 13
oh, there you are. %$* 13
do you mind giving us your name too? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thank you, yes. %$* 239
my name is eileen karovoch and i think i relate to the first gentleman's question. %$* 239
i don't understand the economic benefits of ending the war on terrorism. %$* 239
you talked about the trillions of dollars that we're spending. %$* 239
and i am tired of this recession. %$* 239
how will ending the war on terrorism give money back? %$* 239
well, i mean, it's a factual matter that we spent-- %$* 91
peter bergen. %$* 13
a trillion dollars at least in iraq, right? %$* 91
i mean, we're-- %$* 91
by winding down there and no longer part of the war on terror there, we're going to save ourselves a lot of money. %$* 91
as a factual matter, we spent half a trillion dollars on our intelligence. %$* 91
i think juliette would have a better answer on how much we spend on our homeland security. %$* 91
we spend a huge amount of money on this, and we can't afford it right now. %$* 91
and clearly there is some belt tightening that is needed, and if we stopped having this construct on the war on terror it would help making the hard decisions that we need to make about reducing the size of our bloated – i mentioned the fact that there are a million americans with top-secret clearances. %$* 91
that’s not secret. %$* 91
top secret. %$* 91
i don’t think that all these people really need these top secret clearances. %$* 91
we are facing a group of people that on a good day may now number 300 or 400. %$* 91
but it was a recession question on that. %$* 13
i’m not sure how the clearance issue relates to that. %$* 13
well, are going to have to reduce the number of people in our intelligence apparatus. %$* 91
we are going to have to reduce the number of people, if we are going to draw down in afghanistan and iraq, and by saying that the war on terror is over, that’s going to help those decisions. %$* 91
we asked—slate asked its readers to submit questions to us. %$* 13
slate selected a few for us and i’d like to bring one of them up because i think it goes to this side and to some degree, richard, you had touched on this but it’s more specific. %$* 13
his name is peter mckay and he’s actually from new york city. %$* 13
“since you believe that it is not yet time to end the war on terror, could you please explain what specific conditions you would have to see met to know that that time has come. %$* 13
okay, fair question. %$* 13
michael hayden? %$* 13
i’m kind of with rich. %$* 77
this will be something that we’ll recognize when we see it, like supreme court justice described something else. %$* 77
all i can do is repeat what i said earlier. %$* 77
everybody i know who’s actually responsible for getting us to the state we are in now, which is far better than we were one five or ten years ago – no one thinks it’s time to stop. %$* 77
no one thinks that we’ve gotten to the point for al-qaeda is sufficiently non-resilient that it cannot regenerate. %$* 77
until we've reached that point and make that judgment, no, i don't think we should end what rich and i are arguing we should continue, which is a legal authority to use all the tools at the disposal of the american government. %$* 77
richard, why is it difficult to foresee what those conditions would be? %$* 13
well, it's just something that i wouldn't want to write down on paper or articulate until you have to. %$* 119
and so i'm quite comfortable with the proposition tonight that now is not the time to do it. %$* 119
do i want to rule out that some future time, if we have a new government in pakistan, fundamentally change the environment in the horn of africa and the arabian peninsula, might there be the conditions then? %$* 119
maybe. %$* 119
but there's nothing pushing it. %$* 119
there's no-- %$* 119
as a-- %$* 119
one of the first questions that came from the audience was, what's the harm? %$* 119
i'm not seeing any harm. %$* 119
any benefits that were gained by ending the war on terror as particularly juliette defines it, were already gained when president obama got elected and won the nobel prize principally for not being bush and-- %$* 119
and, you know, this is-- %$* 119
the benefits have already accrued. %$* 119
only harm comes from changing the legal apparatus that allows us to continue offensive military operations. %$* 119
i just don't know-- %$* 238
juliette kayyem. %$* 13
i just don't know how-- %$* 238
i mean, first of all, with all due respect, general hayden, i think no one is arguing that al-qaeda-- %$* 238
no one in authority or who has to deal with dealing with the security apparatus or figuring out how to distribute funds that are drying up, because that's what you know in particular homeland security, that's what state and locals are dealing with, that's what police departments are dealing with, how do i prioritize the threat out there when everyone wants to be safe not just from terrorism but from crime and whatever else may go on. %$* 238
so no one is arguing that we're closing the door to acknowledgement of a threat of terror, and it's just not the debate. %$* 238
and so they're sort of throwing up a bunch of straw men against this typical notion of people who want the american public to acknowledge, and maybe it happened two years ago with the election of obama-- %$* 238
growing recognition that war and what war meant was not the way to describe what we were doing. %$* 238
and general hayden talks about this consensus that we want all the tools in the toolbox, but to remind you-- %$* 238
the consensus was not a consensus because the president decided it was a consensus. %$* 238
it took congress, the courts, the public, leaders within the bush administration, and, yes, a new president, to realize that this construct that we had created over the course of six, eight, or 10 years needed to be thought about in a different way. %$* 238
and that's what we're asking of you, not saying, throw in the towel, let bin laden, hang out with his wives, that is not what we're saying and it's a disservice to people who want to challenge this notion of the war on terror to caricature us that way. %$* 238
okay, i want to go back to another question. %$* 13
sir, i'm looking at you, and you stand up because you seem to be-- %$* 13
just wait for the mike and if you could tell us who you are. %$* 13
i’m matt foley i'm just wondering in 1993 the trade center was bombed first time, and they went a different route, they didn't start a war on terror, they prosecuted the people responsible. %$* 18
could you guys just give me an idea of what the cost of this war on terror has been-- %$* 18
dollars, we know that there's been thousands of lives, but in comparison to what was done in '93, why is this approach better than that one because it seems to me that they were able to apprehend the people responsible much more quickly and with far less human cost-- %$* 18
so your question is to the side against the motion. %$* 13
yes. %$* 240
mike hayden. %$* 13
in its starkest form, the law enforcement approach after the first attack on the world trade center in '93 did not prevent the destruction of the world trade centers in 2001. the "we are a nation at war approach" following 2001 has prevented any similar attack on the united states in the ensuing 10 years. %$* 77
i think that's the biggest distinction. %$* 77
let me just say that-- %$* 119
two years or three years, from '93 to 2000 there was no attacks. %$* 240
right. %$* 77
so what you're saying is that this war-- %$* 240
because we don't know when the next-- %$* 240
hopefully there won't be any more attacks but right now the evidence is-- %$* 240
there actually were. %$* 119
they weren't against the continental united states but they were against u.s. interests abroad, and if i could just say, i'll tell you, one of the rhetorical excesses of the first bush administration and so you know 2001 to 2004 in which i served which troubled me was a-- %$* 119
they did tend to dismiss the law enforcement approach as they were talking about the various military options. %$* 119
there's no question that there was a somewhat disdainful view of the law enforcement. %$* 119
as someone who then left the white house and went and worked in law enforcement, i no longer do, that troubled me because it strikes me as it's a completely legitimate set of options available to the executive branch and deserves no-- %$* 119
it should not be treated disdainfully at all. %$* 119
there were successful prosecutions in that time period. %$* 119
ramzi yousef is currently serving a life sentence in super max. %$* 119
he was one of the architects of it, the nephew of khalid shaikh mohammed, one of the architects of 9/11. %$* 119
but there were many other aspects of that investigation that were enormously problematic, principally concerning the compartmentalization of information and the inability to allow the information generated in the law enforcement investigation to sort of transmute across the inner agency and inform a wider intelligence perspective of a growing threat. %$* 119
now, a few people saw it, but the system as a whole struggled to grasp it. %$* 119
juliette kayyem. %$* 13
i would actually totally agree with rich on this point. %$* 238
i think that the changes that were made over the course of the 10 years, not because we had to call it a war but these are actually statutory changes made to the foreign intelligence surveillance act have brought about tremendous changes within both the law enforcement intelligence community, local law enforcement and whatever else. %$* 238
so i actually would agree with-- %$* 238
i think we’re all sort of-- %$* 238
there are a variety of tools that can be used by any present executive branch member or whatever else to counter al-qaeda and to defeat al-qaeda. %$* 238
sorry i’m going move on just because i think that actually both have answered your question. %$* 13
you might not like the answer, but they’ve addressed it. %$* 13
right-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13

he is the chairman of the board of the rosenkranz foundation and intelligence squared u.s.bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
and what bob does is a lot of study. %$* 13
we both do, before the debates, to really figure out the way that we want to frame this. %$* 13
and so bob is going to do that for us. %$* 13
he's going to talk us through what's at stake here and why we're talking about it now. %$* 13
so, bob, why now? %$* 13
why this debate now? %$* 13
well, of course, this is election season, and we're all seeing the effects of huge amounts of money in politics. %$* 1
so this is really a debate that is timely and especially pertinent following the supreme court decision in citizens united, which created the whole super pac phenomenon. %$* 1
and is this a debate that really has two valid arguments on both sides? %$* 13
i think it does. %$* 1
so the side that's cheering for super pacs, what do they have going for their argument? %$* 13
the biggest thing they have going for their argument is the principle of free speech. %$* 1
in order for speech to be heard, it needs money behind it. %$* 1
and the most important kind of speech of all is political speech. %$* 1
and critical political speech is essential because otherwise congress or the president could shut down speech that's critical. %$* 1
and the side arguing against? %$* 13
their best argument it seems to me, is that things have gotten out of hand. %$* 1
there's just too much damn money involved in politics, and we're drowning out the voices of people who can't be heard because they don't have access to money to get on the airwaves. %$* 1
and one thing the citizens united decision changed in 2010 is increased participation by corporations and unions. %$* 13
how does that change the game? %$* 13
well, i think that the unions have always been a source of very, very big money in politics and almost always on the democratic side, probably 98 percent or so. %$* 1
corporations, on the other hand, have been divided pretty equally between democrats and republicans, in part because they want to hedge their bets, and in part because they don't want to offend any of their customers. %$* 1
so in some sense, this legislation-- %$* 1
i'm sorry, court decision, really opens the door not so much for corporations but for wealthy individuals. %$* 1
all right, bob, thank you very much again for making this event happen. %$* 13
and now let's welcome our debaters to the stage, everybody. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i just would like to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
deep and durable and well-known by all of us is the influence and place of money in american politics. %$* 13
if you go to that famous quip by one of the all-time politicos of american history, mark hanna, an ohio republican, this is what he said: "there are two things that are important in politics. %$* 13
the first is money. %$* 13
and i can't remember what the second one is." hanna died in 1904.he did not have super pacs. %$* 13
but we do, and we have a debate. %$* 13
"two cheers for super pacs: money and politics is still overregulated," that is our motion. %$* 13
i'm john donovan, a debate from intelligence squared u.s., four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, all of whom have grappled with the question of where money fits into a system that we refer to as democracy. %$* 13
we debate, as always, in three rounds. %$* 13
then the audience votes to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
on the side for the motion, "two cheers for super pacs," david keating, president of the center for competitive politics. %$* 13
your partner is jacob sullum. %$* 13
he is a senior editor at reason magazine. %$* 13
on the side arguing against the motion, trevor potter. %$* 13
he is president and general counsel of the campaign legal center. %$* 13
and your partner is jonathan soros. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the roosevelt institute and cofounder of friends of democracy. %$* 13
going to introduce our debaters once again in more depth for our television broadcasts. %$* 13
and i know you just applauded your hearts out for them. %$* 13
but when i name them again, i'm going to ask you to do that one more time. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." let's meet our debaters and welcome first, david keating. %$* 13
and, david, earlier this year, you became president of the center for competitive politics. %$* 13
it represented a group that you also founded in a landmark case that was speechnow.org versus the federal election committee. %$* 13
citizens united gets most of the credit for the fact that we have super pacs. %$* 13
but without speechnow, we would not have them at all. %$* 13
and in addition to that involvement, you also spent a lot of time in your career working on tax policy. %$* 13
so the question is, which is the more twisted set of legislation: campaign finance or tax policy? %$* 13
well, that's simple. %$* 265
the election laws. %$* 265
the tax laws are a model of clarity and simplicity. %$* 265
by comparison. %$* 13
yes. %$* 265
and the irs is reasonable compared to the federal election committee. %$* 265
all right. %$* 13
thank you, david keating. %$* 13
your partner, arguing for the motion, "two cheers for super pacs," jacob sullum. %$* 13
jacob, you are a senior editor at reason magazine where the motto is "free minds and free markets." you are also the author of "saying yes: in defense of drug use." jacob, you graduated from cornell university where you majored in both economics and psychology, psych and ec. %$* 13
and the question is, is that what equals a libertarian? %$* 13
i did learn a lot about politicians in my abnormal psych course. %$* 266
all right. %$* 13
our motion is "two cheers for super pacs: money and politics is still overregulated." here arguing against the motion first, trevor potter. %$* 13
trevor, you are president and general counsel of the campaign legal center and a former commissioner and chairman of the federal election commission. %$* 13
but you may also know trevor as the man behind steven colbert's super pac, americans for a better tomorrow tomorrow. %$* 13
you are an attorney, and you've advised several republican presidential candidates. %$* 13
so how did you end up on comedy central? %$* 13
i answered my phone. %$* 267
easy enough. %$* 13
it could have been a pollster. %$* 13
steven colbert called, said, "can you explain what a pac is? %$* 267
" i laid it out, explained how to game the system. %$* 267
he said, "are you willing to say that in public? %$* 267
all right, i-- %$* 13
thanks, trevor potter. %$* 13
and let's meet your partner, also arguing against super pacs, jonathan soros. %$* 13
jonathan, you are a senior fellow at the roosevelt institute and ceo of js capital management. %$* 13
you are also one of the cofounders of friends of democracy. %$* 13
and a washington post headline about this says it all: "son of liberal financier george soros launches anti-super pac super pac." so how does that work? %$* 13
well, we're never going to change any of these rules unless we can build some political power to do so. %$* 268
and right now both political parties are locked into the status quo. %$* 268
and so the only way to do so is from the outside. %$* 268
so working from the inside. %$* 13
all right, thank you. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our team of debaters. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
one side will win, and one side will lose. %$* 13
and in that debate, you, our audience, our live audience, act as the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate is ended, you will have been asked to vote twice; once before the arguments and once again at the end. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved your position, your vote on this proposition, the greatest, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's register your first vote. %$* 13
go to the key pads at your seat. %$* 13
on the right hand side, and the numbers one, two and three are the only ones you need to worry about. %$* 13
our motion is "two cheers for super pacs: money and politics is still overregulated." and if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other numbers. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you make a mistake, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and what we're going to do is hold that vote until the end of the debate when you vote the second time. %$* 13
and then we'll reveal both numbers. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most on this motion will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so onto round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and speaking first up for the motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money and politics is still overregulated," david keating. %$* 13
he is president of the center for competitive politics. %$* 13
before this, he was executive director of the club for growth and president of speechnow.org, an organization that he founded to protect free political speech. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, david keating. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 265
i think largely what we have tonight is a debate about the first amendment and what it means and whether we still value the first amendment. %$* 265
do we want to keep the first amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to say something else? %$* 265
and who will say what that "something else" is? %$* 265
first, let's review what it says. %$* 265
it's pretty simple actually. %$* 265
the part that we're talking about tonight is congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. %$* 265
well, i'm sorry to inform that we have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech. %$* 265
the supreme court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on political speech. %$* 265
we have laws and regulations that come to-- %$* 265
close to 400,000 words. %$* 265
but these words are not clear enough so the federal election commission has already issued close to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means. %$* 265
and on top of that, there have been nearly eight-- %$* 265
7,000 enforcement actions by the federal election commission during its history. %$* 265
to really understand the law, you need to understand all that. %$* 265
and the fact is no one does understand what the election law means. %$* 265
in fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire a lawyer like this one over here. %$* 265
i don't know how much he charges, but most grassroots groups probably can't afford it. %$* 265
and if they don't have a lawyer, they're probably going to make mistakes. %$* 265
i lived under this, working at a political committee. %$* 265
i saw the regulations firsthand, and we-- %$* 265
a lot of this we're getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn't get an answer to many of our basic questions. %$* 265
on top of that, in 2002 congress passed the mccain-feingold act, and for many of us that was the last straw. %$* 265
a portion of that-- %$* 265
not all of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive no matter what our views on politics. %$* 265
part of it said that within 60 days of an election, a group that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the name of a congressman if it aired on radio or tv. that was illegal. %$* 265
now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that. %$* 265
i thought that was outrageous. %$* 265
and there is no group fighting on the political front for the first amendment. %$* 265
we hear about groups fighting for second amendment rights but not first amendment rights. %$* 265
that's why i started speechnow.org because i think we need a group to fight for our political free speech rights. %$* 265
now, i designed this group in a way that i thought would allow us to be effective. %$* 265
in fact, one of our panelists who doesn't support free speech-- %$* 265
unfettered free speech has adopted the speechnow.org model, which is now called a super pac.and basically here's how it works. %$* 265
it's americans getting together and pooling their money. %$* 265
i talk to you. %$* 265
i make the case as to why you should donate money, so then we can talk to other americans. %$* 265
that's what the speechnow model was. %$* 265
there was only one problem with it. %$* 265
it was illegal to do that. %$* 265
so the speechnow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued the fdc, to make a long story short, we won. %$* 265
that case, speechnow.org versus fdc, is what created the super pac.now, let me explain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different from normal pacs. %$* 265
these are different from political parties. %$* 265
these are literally americans getting together independently. %$* 265
the federal election commission calls these groups "independent expenditure only committees" because that's all they can do. %$* 265
we don't make any donations to candidates. %$* 265
we don’t make any donations to political parties. %$* 265
we don't coordinate our speech with the candidates. %$* 265
we don't coordinate our speech with the political parties. %$* 265
all of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on the internet on the fdc website. %$* 265
and all of our spending is donated-- %$* 265
is reported as well. %$* 265
that is what the media has come to call a "super pac."so when you think about it, what's wrong with that? %$* 265
it's basically a group of people getting together and saying, "hey, we want to speak to our fellow americans about what direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, who should represent us, and we're not going to give any money to the candidates or the parties." that's what a super pac is. %$* 265
now, this model has been so popular that there are now 805 of them that have formed since june of 2010 when super pacs first became legal. %$* 265
now, i want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech. %$* 265
and i will go back to 1967, when a u.s.senator named gene mccarthy wanted to run for president. %$* 265
the incumbent president, lyndon baines johnson, was a very powerful political figure. %$* 265
today most people would think it'd be impossible to take down a sitting president in a primary, especially if you started in november previous to the election year. %$* 265
but gene mccarthy did it. %$* 265
and you know how he did it? %$* 265
he went to a handful of people, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today's dollars of $10 million, $10 million. %$* 265
now, that's the kind of money that we're talking about in super pacs, but back then, the money went directly into gene mccarthy's campaign committee. %$* 265
gene mccarthy was opposed to the vietnam war. %$* 265
he wanted to make his run for president based on opposing the vietnam war. %$* 265
and he wanted to help build a movement to help end the vietnam war. %$* 265
he couldn't have done it without those contributions. %$* 265
he couldn't have done it. %$* 265
and you know what? %$* 265
he did it. %$* 265
he didn't win the nomination, but he forced lbj out of the race. %$* 265
and it's the only time since-- %$* 265
since we've passed these campaign restrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger. %$* 265
and i daresay it probably won't happen for many, many years. %$* 265
so if you believe in the right of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to do everything they can to speak to other americans. %$* 265
and independent political groups are the way to do it. %$* 265
thank you. %$* 265
thank you, david keating. %$* 13
our motion is, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." and here to debate against the motion, trevor potter. %$* 13
he is president and general counsel of the campaign legal center and a former commissioner and chairman of the federal election commission. %$* 13
he is also the lawyer behind the creation of stephen colbert's pac, americans for a better tomorrow tomorrow. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, trevor potter. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 267
may surprise our worthy opponents, but all of us on the stage tonight recognize and celebrate the importance of the first amendment, the right each of us has as citizens to criticize the government and speak freely. %$* 267
we are all american patriots in this room tonight, not supporters of king george iii.none of us believe that the crown, or our government, should be free of criticism. %$* 267
but our opponents want this to begin and end as a debate about the first amendment, and only about their view of the first amendment. %$* 267
they want to ignore the rest of the constitution and the functioning of the government that we the people created. %$* 267
the constitution created a congress that represents the will of the people, the voters. %$* 267
it created a president whose job is to faithfully execute the laws passed by congress. %$* 267
what we have learned over the last 200 years, by sad experience, is that our government can be corrupted by campaign money so that it primarily responds to the sources of money that fund elections-- %$* 267
special interests and big political contributors and spenders-- %$* 267
rather than representing the people and seeking the common good. %$* 267
so tonight i'm going to look at how campaign money can corrupt our government and why, for 100 years, there have been limits on money spent in politics to try and control that corruption. %$* 267
then, my debating partner jonathan soros will explain why super pacs and their related nonprofit c4s and c6s only make the possibility of corruption greater. %$* 267
theodore roosevelt began this national discussion in 1905 after being elected president with huge contributions from wall street. %$* 267
he actually had mark hanna. %$* 267
and mark hanna had what we would call super pac money, unlimited contributions from corporations that elected roosevelt. %$* 267
afterwards, those corporations came to him for their reward which they expected would be less government regulation. %$* 267
roosevelt responded by saying to congress, "all contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law. %$* 267
directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes." later, he said, "every special interest is entitled to justice, but none is entitled to a vote in congress to a voice on the bench."congress reacted to roosevelt's call by passing the tillman act in 1907 forbidding corporate political contributions in federal elections. %$* 267
later in 1947, the taft act extended this prohibition to labor unions and to independent expenditures. %$* 267
roosevelt and the congress believed that the election of representatives of the people to congress should be left to individual citizens and voters, not corporate or union interests almost always seeking special legislative favors in return. %$* 267
under president richard nixon, these prohibitions were violated because of a lack of disclosure. %$* 267
then in the watergate scandal, these hidden violations became public. %$* 267
we learned that the department of justice had dropped an antitrust case against itt in return for $400,000 given to finance the republican convention where nixon wanted it. %$* 267
we might never have known that except an itt lobbyist wrote it all down in an internal memo which then saw the light of day. %$* 267
the result was that after watergate, congress passed new reform laws and tried to require the disclosure of all money given for political purposes. %$* 267
these laws were later revised and strengthened in the mccain- feingold law in 2002.as senator alan simpson said at that time, too often members' first thought is not what is right or what they will believe, but how it will affect fundraising. %$* 267
who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue? %$* 267
the goal of each of these laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action or inaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns. %$* 267
just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption. %$* 267
as the supreme court said in the buckley case in 1976, congress has the right to deal with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permitting unlimited financial contributions. %$* 267
the supreme court also recognized one other reality in that case which is central to our debate today. %$* 267
there is a significant difference between my speaking myself or giving my money to someone else for their speech. %$* 267
my own speech and my own words has higher first amendment protection than a contribution. %$* 267
that brings us to the world of super pacs. %$* 267
they were created, as we heard, by the supreme court citizens united decision and the dc circuit's speechnow case. %$* 267
the majority in citizens united, overturning previous decisions, said that in their view of the first amendment, corporations had the same right as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal elections because such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. %$* 267
the court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can never corrupt on two important predicates. %$* 267
the spending must be totally independent of candidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words of justice kennedy and citizens united, the public can see whether elected officials are in the pockets of so-called money interests. %$* 267
so are their spending totally independent of candidates? %$* 267
do we have full disclosure? %$* 267
jonathan soros will tell us in a few minutes. %$* 267
thank you, trevor potter. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two who are fighting it out over this motion: "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overrated"-- %$* 13
you have-- %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
not overrated. %$* 13
i'm going to say that again so that-- %$* 13
so that that can be edited out. %$* 13
it's great to control the process. %$* 13
"two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." you have heard two opening statements, and now onto the third to debate for the motion: "two cheers for super pacs," a senior editor at reason magazine and reason.com, an award-winning journalist and author of the critically acclaimed books, "saying yes," and "for your own good," jacob sullum. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 266
i feel a little bit under qualified for this debate because i think i'm the only panelist who has not created a super pac.although i briefly contemplated starting an anti-anti-super pac super pac.it seemed too complicated to me, but maybe trevor could help me out. %$* 266
so i'm talking instead from the perspective of somebody who has been writing about civil liberties issues for about 25 years now. %$* 266
and i see this as fundamentally an issue of freedom of speech. %$* 266
consider the legal situation before the citizens united case. %$* 266
wealthy individuals were free to speak without limit. %$* 266
jonathan's father, for example, spent about $24 billion during the-- %$* 266
or excuse me, million dollars during the 2004 election season to defeat george w.bush. %$* 266
and more power to him. %$* 266
media corporations such as the ones that own fox news and the new york times were also free to speak without limit. %$* 266
parties and candidates could spend as much as they wanted on political messages, although the contributions for them were limited. %$* 266
by contrast, unions, businesses and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the nra or the aclu, could not talk about their issues on the air close to an election if they happen to mention the name of a candidate for federal office. %$* 266
furthermore, as david mentioned, people of lesser means could not get together and pool their resources to use for election-related messages unless they registered with the fec and were subject to strict contribution limits. %$* 266
people often overlook what was actually at issue in the citizens united case. %$* 266
this was a documentary that was produced by a conservative group, citizens united. %$* 266
it was called "hillary: the movie." they wanted to air it during the 2008 election season, and they were prohibited from doing so. %$* 266
why? %$* 266
first of all, it mentioned a candidate for federal office. %$* 266
she was running for the democratic presidential nomination at the time. %$* 266
and two, it made her look bad. %$* 266
now, whatever you think about hillary clinton or about this particular movie about her, how can that possibly be consistent with a constitutional provision that says "congressional shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech"? %$* 266
the supreme court concluded that it could not. %$* 266
and it also concluded that the first amendment made it-- %$* 266
forced it to override an earlier rule that said you cannot engage and express advocacy if you are a corporation or a union, meaning you explicitly were advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. %$* 266
you frequently hear a couple of arguments in response to this decision from people who didn't like it. %$* 266
first of all, they say, money is not speech. %$* 266
well, that's literally true. %$* 266
but you do need money in order to get your message across to a mass audience. %$* 266
so i suppose congress passed a law saying newspapers can exist, but they can't spend any money. %$* 266
or newspapers can exist, but they can only spend up to this amount of money. %$* 266
clearly, that would be abridging the freedom of the press. %$* 266
similarly, if congress said, you can spend as much as you want if you're a newspaper, but we're going to limit how much you can take in from advertisers and readers. %$* 266
so once you understand that this is really controlling-- %$* 266
money in effect is controlling speech, i think you also have to recognize that loosening these regulations on speech does not mean empowering people to buy elections. %$* 266
why? %$* 266
because the messages that you pay for still have to persuade voters. %$* 266
you're still talking about convincing people to vote a certain way. %$* 266
there are a number of striking illustrations from recent elections that show you that money can't buy you love. %$* 266
and i'll just give you a couple of them. %$* 266
one from 2010, linda mcmahan is trying again this year. %$* 266
she spent $46 million of her own money on a senate campaign in connecticut. %$* 266
it was nearly a hundred dollars for every vote she received. %$* 266
she lost by 12 points. %$* 266
this year, jeff lake won the republican nomination for the senate in arizona. %$* 266
even though he was outspent two to one, he won by 48 points. %$* 266
so clearly, money is not the whole story. %$* 266
it is, nevertheless, true that in general, the people who win tend to spend more. %$* 266
but it's also true that stronger candidates tend to attract more money. %$* 266
well, what makes a candidate strong? %$* 266
there are various characteristics that you can imagine that would make people both better able to raise money and better able to get votes, charisma, popular policy positions, but one of the most important is incumbency. %$* 266
and incumbency gives people tremendous advantages in terms of visibility, the power to dispense pork, name recognition, and the reelection rates for members of congress are insanely high. %$* 266
i mean, historically, in the past few cycles, 90 percent or more even in the last-- %$* 266
in the 2010, when democrats lost a bunch of seats, it was still about 85 percent. %$* 266
so incumbents have this huge advantage and they use campaign finance regulations to reinforce that advantage. %$* 266
one great example is the so-called millionaires amendment, which was part of mccain-feingold act. %$* 266
it said that if you face an opponent who is spending his own money, he's financing his own campaign, then we're going to lift the limits on the contributions you can get. %$* 266
so this is clearly designed to help out incumbents who are facing self financed challengers. %$* 266
another argument you often hear is that corporations are not people. %$* 266
well, that's also literally true, but corporations are created by people. %$* 266
i mean, they're not created by robots or dolphins or extraterrestrials. %$* 266
i mean, they're created to achieve certain goals. %$* 266
the question in citizens united was whether people lose the right to freedom of speech when they organize themselves as corporations. %$* 266
i think people tend to think when you hear the word "corporation" of these huge businesses like wal- mart or exxon mobile, but, you know, every one of us works for a corporation. %$* 266
this debate tonight is sponsored by a corporation. %$* 266
the groups that are complaining that corporations have too much influence over politics are themselves corporations, right? %$* 266
so you have to understand that corporations overwhelmingly consist of small businesses and nonprofits, not these huge businesses. %$* 266
and they represent all sorts of points of view and take on all sorts of issues. %$* 266
our moderator, by the way, works for a corporation, walt disney company, correct? %$* 266
and he had this privilege before citizens united that most corporations did not, they were allowed to talk about politics on the air even if it meant mentioning a candidate for federal office. %$* 266
now, that was an exemption, a media exemption for media corporations, that journalists took for granted, but it's very hard to justify under the first amendment because when you talk about the freedom of the press you're not talking about the freedom of members of professional news organizations, you're talking about the freedom to use technologies of mass communication. %$* 266
that's a freedom that we all have that's guaranteed to all of us by the first amendment. %$* 266
so by lifting the restrictions on the money that people could collect and spend on political messages, these two decisions, citizens united and speechnow, signal that freedom of speech is not a privilege that's reserved to billionaires or to media corporations or to politicians, it's a right that belongs to all of us no matter how we choose to organize ourselves. %$* 266
and i think we're seeing benefits from that in terms of diversity of voices and greater competition in elections that we can talk about later. %$* 266
thank you. %$* 266
yes. %$* 13

thank you. %$* 266
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, jacob sullum. %$* 13
our final debater, and he is speaking against the motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated," is jonathan soros. %$* 13
jonathan is chief executive officer of js capital management and a senior fellow at the roosevelt institute and cofounder of the super pac, friends of democracy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan soros. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 268
i can see that we're going to have a lot to talk about tonight, but my partner, trevor potter, laid out the case for why in response to the first amendment we still have an important interest in mitigating the corruption that can result from even independent political activity but from in particular from contributions to candidates. %$* 268
i'm going to take us on a closer look at the proposition, itself, "two cheers for super pacs," and suggest that we don't even have the rules that super pacs were premised on. %$* 268
mr. %$* 268
keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super pacs are, but that doesn't really resemble what they are in fact. %$* 268
after 40 years of supreme court intervention, what we have is more loophole than law. %$* 268
let's start with the issue of independence. %$* 268
as my partner mentioned, the supreme court has repeatedly said that speech that is independent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted. %$* 268
let's set aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed up and said, "i'm going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position x or position y," that that's not going to have some influence on candidates or elected officials. %$* 268
we'll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what "independent" really means today because the rules around what independent is for super pacs are basically nonexistent. %$* 268
there are in effect only two rules that apply. %$* 268
one, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and what their resources are with a super pac, and the super pac may not give a contribution directly to the campaign. %$* 268
obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, like spending lots of money on television. %$* 268
there are more rules about what goldman sachs' partners can say to each other than there are about what super pacs can say to candidates. %$* 268
we've all seen the jokes that this leads to. %$* 268
my partner's super pac, americans for a better tomorrow tomorrow, has been referenced several times. %$* 268
it's one of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months. %$* 268
i would strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it. %$* 268
it's really funny. %$* 268
but what we're seeing in that-- %$* 268
and they've provided a tremendous example-- %$* 268
is that there are, in effect, no lines between super pacs and candidates. %$* 268
let's just give a couple of examples. %$* 268
candidates can raise money for super pacs. %$* 268
they can show up at their fundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit. %$* 268
but then what happens after they leave? %$* 268
who knows? %$* 268
we all know, at least in the presidential election, the super pacs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates, in both instances. %$* 268
candidates can endorse super pacs. %$* 268
you hear mitt romney talking about "my" super pac.and just in the last couple of weeks, since we've watched the conventions, we heard about karl rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to president bush and to many other republicans, getting briefings about his super pac around tampa. %$* 268
and last week in charlotte, rahm emmanuel, who had been, at one time, white house chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the obama campaign, left that position and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention about how he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the obama-aligned super pac.so, clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke. %$* 268
that, in effect, leaving aside what's happened in the super pac, has undermined something we thought we had before. %$* 268
we thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very good reason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions to candidates. %$* 268
now, those rules still technically exist. %$* 268
you can still only give $2,500 to a candidate. %$* 268
you can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party. %$* 268
but you can then turn around and give $25 million to a super pac that's working, essentially, as a surrogate for the campaign. %$* 268
though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 are irrelevant to most of the population anyway. %$* 268
it's only 1 percent of 1 percent of the population that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities. %$* 268
well, now, with super pacs, we've seen that shrink even further. %$* 268
so 200 people account for 80 percent of the money that was raised for super pacs, at least as of the last filing. %$* 268
lastly, let's talk about transparency. %$* 268
it's true; super pacs do have to disclose their donors and their expenditures. %$* 268
transparency is something that the supreme court speaks glowingly of in citizens united and other cases. %$* 268
but there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollars through, right? %$* 268
you don't have to give your political money to a super pac.you can give your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations can give them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as super pacs can do, and they don't have to disclose their donors. %$* 268
so when people say, "how much money is being spent in this election? %$* 268
" the answer is, "we actually don't really know." we know that it will be more than ever before, but we don't know exactly how much, and we don't know exactly where it's coming from. %$* 268
these are problems that can be addressed. %$* 268
we can have rules on transparency that address disclosure of all political spending that's related to the election. %$* 268
we can have rules, coherent rules, around independence that require that super pacs are at least an arm's length distance from the campaigns. %$* 268
we need a functioning enforcement agency, and i hope that we'll have a chance to talk a little bit about the dysfunction of the fcc later on. %$* 268
but none of this will make a difference without an alternative. %$* 268
a friend of mine likes to say that transparency alone is like the webcam that was at the bottom of the gulf of mexico showing us the deep water horizon well, right? %$* 268
shows you everything that's spewing into the gulf, but it doesn't do anything to fix it. %$* 268
we need an alternative. %$* 268
we need a system of citizen- funded elections that allow candidates to run for political office without dependence on large contributions and big donors. %$* 268
that's commonly known as public financing, but when you think about it as a system that is designed to change the incentives of candidates, then it becomes something slightly different. %$* 268
if you think about a system we have in new york where, if you're participating in the system, $175 contribution is matched six-to-one. %$* 268
what's the result? %$* 268
it's transformed the way that funds are raised for city offices here in new york. %$* 268
instead of going to the plaza or the waldorf, you're going to people's living rooms and dining rooms talking to normal folks, constituents about what the interests of their community are. %$* 268
so if the premise of this debate had been "money and politics is badly regulated," i would have happily switched sides and sat over there and argued that case. %$* 268
but the answer to the current lawlessness is better rules, not less of them. %$* 268
thank you, jonathan soros. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
now we move on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this: "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." we have two teams of two arguing it out. %$* 13
david keating and jacob sullum are arguing for two cheers. %$* 13
they say that in a world where political speech depends on money, you don't want to put limits on either of those things; that, in fact, super pacs and spending of money in politics has the effect of extending and widening political discourse and that attempts to regulate it usually are instigated by politicians who are already sitting in office and don't want their competition to be financed and elected either. %$* 13
on the other side, trevor potter and jonathan soros are making the argument against super pacs. %$* 13
they're saying that unlimited money puts people into office who are then beholden to the suppliers of the unlimited money. %$* 13
the larger the amount, the more beholden that they'll be, especially if the source of the money is secret. %$* 13
they say that what's needed is a better and saner system of regulation, but that regulation, there must be. %$* 13
i want to put a question to the side that is arguing for super pacs. %$* 13
your opponents have really hammered at the theme that money is corrosive in politics, essentially that votes can be bought. %$* 13
and i didn't hear in your statements from either of you that you are especially agitated about that phenomenon. %$* 13
david keating. %$* 13
well, there is really no evidence that votes can be bought. %$* 265
the voters still-- %$* 265
no, come on. %$* 265
we-- %$* 265
out of 58 candidates who used 500,000 or more of their own money in federal races in 2010, fewer than one in five won. %$* 265
so my point is simple: that money does not control the outcome of the election. %$* 265
i'm not saying money isn't important, but it's just one factor. %$* 265
i do also want to point out a lot of what you just heard from jonathan is just simply wrong about the regulations. %$* 265
he said, for example, we don't know how much is spent in the election. %$* 265
that's simply not true. %$* 265
any independent expenditure that is run in the election needs to be reported to the federal election commission. %$* 265
that is a law. %$* 265
now, you can argue about whether people are abiding by the law or not. %$* 265
but they-- %$* 265
i think, by and large, people are reporting their independent expenditures. %$* 265
all right, let me-- %$* 13
now, there are other things, perhaps, that are not-- %$* 265
let me let you come back to some of the points because you are raising a couple of things that i want to let this side respond to. %$* 13
and the first of those is your response to my question that, yeah, money is necessary, money plays a part, but that money ultimately isn't nearly as corrosive as your side has been talking about. %$* 13
it's not that bad a problem. %$* 13
take that, trevor potter. %$* 13
well, we're talking about two things. %$* 267
david's talking about whether you can guarantee you're going to win an election if you spend a lot of your own money. %$* 267
that's-- %$* 267
we're not saying that. %$* 267
what we're saying is that we have a history in this country. %$* 267
it's human nature that candidates who become office holders are going to be grateful to the people who put them there if they can identify somebody who spent an enormous amount of money to elect them. %$* 267
they are going to feel beholden to them rather than everyone else. %$* 267
so with that clarification, let me bring that back to this side, jacob sullum. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 266
i mean, actually, it often goes unnoted that in most states it was perfectly legal for corporations and unions to spend money on political campaigns even prior to citizens united, and there's no evidence that the states that allowed unlimited spending by unions and corporations were more corrupt than the states that didn't. %$* 266
you would expect there to be some evidence if it's the case that money is corrupting. %$* 266
that doesn't seem to be the case. %$* 266
i mean, it seems commonsensical that obviously money buys people's votes. %$* 266
but in fact if you look at the research that's been done, there's very little evidence that legislators are actually driven by the campaign donations they're receiving as opposed to their party's interest, their constituents' interests, things that might appeal to the voters who elected them. %$* 266
by the way, i find a lot of that, at least as troubling as selling your vote for money. %$* 266
i think that is something to be concerned about, selling your vote for money. %$* 266
but i think we should be more focused on the actual policies being introduced by politicians. %$* 266
and if they're good policies for bad reasons, i prefer that to bad policies for good reasons. %$* 266
so, you know, for a politician to do something like take other people's money from around the country and spend it on some pork barrel project in his district and then go to brag to voters about this and say, "reelect me. %$* 266
look how great i am," he's basically stealing other people's money from around the country and using that money to buy the votes of the voters. %$* 266
and to me that's at least equally troubling. %$* 266
so the side arguing against the-- %$* 13
perfectly legal though. %$* 266
your opponents are saying that there is no evidence that in fact politicians will be influenced in office by contributions from donors as they were running for office. %$* 13
jonathan soros or trevor potter, do you want to take that on? %$* 13
so maybe just very quickly first, without getting-- %$* 268
i think we could get into a very technical debate. %$* 268
but issue advertising is not disclosed. %$* 268
there's a lot of that going on this summer. %$* 268
it doesn't flow through independent expenditure committees, and so it doesn't get disclosed. %$* 268
so in the aggregate, we actually don't know the answer. %$* 268
so i don't think we want to get bogged down on that. %$* 268
i think one of the things we should think about here is the definition of corruption in the first instance. %$* 268
and because we're not only talking about buying a vote, that there's actually a deal that says, i'm going to hand you this money, and you're going to vote this way. %$* 268
we're talking about, a, that does-- %$* 268
that is an issue that can be prosecuted. %$* 268
it doesn't happen-- %$* 268
can i step in, just to the bottom and i will let you continue. %$* 13
but they're saying there really is no evidence that-- %$* 13
there really is no evidence that politicians will perform in office according to how they were funded on the way to office. %$* 13
well, what they said was there's no evidence of corruption. %$* 267
that would be a great surprise to all those people sitting in jail across the country because they were the subject of fbi stings where they took money for official action. %$* 267
there are people in a variety of state legislatures. %$* 267
there're members of congress who have freezers full of cash because they took-- %$* 267
okay, but that's not-- %$* 13
those are direct bribes. %$* 18
those are not campaign contributions. %$* 18
yeah, he's got you. %$* 13
that's-- %$* 13
those are two different things. %$* 18
actually, you know, a couple weeks ago, the governor of alabama was returned to jail for having taken a campaign contribution and then given someone an official appointment for it. %$* 267
i'm not saying everyone does this. %$* 267
i'm saying two things: first, it definitely has happened across the country and in our history. %$* 267
there is a long series of affidavits in the mccain-feingold litigation and testimony from members of congress and, not surprisingly, former members who feel freer to speak about it saying, i see votes affected all the time by where the money came from, which industry was being affected. %$* 267
and that's the underlying corrosive problem, plus the amount of time that these members spend, which is now estimated at up to 70 percent of their working days raising money. %$* 267
those are the problems we face. %$* 267
we're talking about a couple of different things here. %$* 265
david keating. %$* 13
what we're talking about here is the ability of americans to get together as-- %$* 265
in groups together to speak to each other and to speak to other americans. %$* 265

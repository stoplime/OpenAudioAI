i want to bring to the stage-- %$* 13
what we like to do is just take a little bit of a moment to frame this debate and the question of why we're doing this debate and its relevance. %$* 13
and to do that, we always bring to the stage at this point robert rosenkranz, who is the chairman of intelligence squared u.s.and i'd like to bring him out now. %$* 13
robert, why this debate? %$* 13
why does this one intrigue you, in particular? %$* 13
because i know it does. %$* 13
i kind of got interested in this topic by reading a book about science. %$* 1
it was by the astronomer royal of england, a man called martin rees, and the book was called "just six numbers." and it was about six physical constants that were imprinted in the early universe, in the first 100 millionth of a second after the big bang. %$* 1
and these constants express ideas like the strength of gravity, the strength of the bond that keeps the nucleus of atoms together, the uniformity of that initial fireball. %$* 1
and if any of those six numbers was much larger or much smaller, we would really not have a universe; either stars and galaxies wouldn't have formed, or there'd be no elements as complicated as carbon and oxygen, or the big bang would've been succeeded by a big crunch into a black hole in which all matter would've disappeared. %$* 1
and when you think about this, or at least for me, i thought, could this be just chance or is there some uncanny intelligence at work in this early design? %$* 1
and for the-- %$* 13
what we're doing here tonight, why is this not-- %$* 13
you know, this has been going on for a long time, this conversation, why is this not just the scopes monkey trial all over again? %$* 13
well, because i think this conversation should be much more sophisticated than when dealing with the literal truth of something in the old testament. %$* 1
and, in addition, of course, science has moved on so much since that time. %$* 1
so i think this is going to be a very-- %$* 1
a much more subtle and interesting debate than that one might have been. %$* 1
i'm sure it's going to be, because we're going to bring out our debaters so that you can meet them, and we'll let the debate get started. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
two of you are in the dark, and i don't mean that metaphorically. %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
let there be light. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
in fairness, we have to let the other side do the same thing. %$* 13
i just want to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
newton invented calculus, and he believed in god; max planck was the father of quantum physics, also a believer; copernicus, the solar system, he had the faith; and galileo and francis bacon and pascal, they all believed. %$* 13
what they also all had in common is that none of them was born within 150 years of us. %$* 13
today, three out of every five scientists, knowing what they know, said that they can't really buy into the concept of god. %$* 13
science refutes god, they would say. %$* 13
really? %$* 13
so then what about the two out of five scientists who do believe in god and they actually know the same stuff? %$* 13
it sounds like the makings of a great debate, so let's get on to it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: science refutes god. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s. i'm john donvan, we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for and against that motion, "science refutes god." our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only side wins. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion "science refutes god," lawrence krauss, a theoretical physicist and director of the origins project at arizona state university. %$* 13
his partner is michael shermer; he is a founding publisher of skeptic magazine, and a columnist for scientific america. %$* 13
on the side arguing against the motion that science refutes god, dinesh d'souza; he is the bestselling author of "what's so great about christianity? %$* 13
‚Äù and director of the documentary, "2016: obama's america." and his partner is ian hutchinson. %$* 13
ian hutchinson is the professor of nuclear science and engineering at massachusetts institute of technology. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
our motion is, "science refutes god." and welcome first to argue in support of the motion, lawrence krauss. %$* 13
oh, that was confusing. %$* 13
i'm eager. %$* 199
you are eager. %$* 13
so, lawrence, i first want to chat with you just-- %$* 13
just a moment. %$* 13
so i want to tell folks, you are a theoretical physicist. %$* 13
your research interests have included partial physics, dark matter, neutrino astrophysics, which is kind of easy stuff for all of us. %$* 13
you also-- %$* 13
you like to push buttons, and you wrote "forget jesus: the stars died so that you could be here today," which doesn't sound very polite. %$* 13
do you think that's provocative? %$* 199
slightly, yeah. %$* 13
well, i think provoking people and ridicule and satire is incredibly important in the world today. %$* 199
nothing should be above ridicule because it gets people to think and least of all, religion. %$* 199
and your partner is? %$* 13
michael shermer. %$* 199
ladies and gentlemen, michael shermer. %$* 13
michael, you are the founder of skeptic magazine and the skeptics society. %$* 13
you were not always skeptical on this issue. %$* 13
you, as a teenager, were a born-again christian, and then you switched to the other team. %$* 13
you're what my eighth grade nun would call "a very brazen and naughty boy." %$* 13
well, i'd be happy to talk to her about it for you if you like, but-- %$* 200
she passed on, which i think would go to the other side. %$* 13
well, i was a born-again evangelical. %$* 200
i went knocking on doors to doors to tell people about jesus. %$* 200
and then later when i became a born-again atheist, i went back to those same houses and knocked on their doors %$* 200
i was wrong. %$* 200
all right. %$* 13
our motion is "science refutes god." we have two debaters arguing against this motion. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce the first, ladies and gentlemen, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
dinesh, you're a best-selling author and the director of "2016: obama's america," the second highest grossing political documentary of all time. %$* 13
you have debated this issue a number of times. %$* 13
you've been on stages arguing against atheists a lot. %$* 13
and a lot of times they say that science refutes god, but you came out with a book called "god forsaken." and the way you turn this argument on its head, how? %$* 13
well, i think science is a-- %$* 201
can be a tool to help us understand god. %$* 201
and so far from science refuting god, i see science as a wonderful instrument for helping us learn about the world and thus learning about its creator. %$* 201
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is ian hutchinson. %$* 201
ladies and gentlemen, ian hutchinson. %$* 13
ian hutchinson, you are a professor of nuclear science and engineering at mit. your contributions to science include, and i take this from your biography online at mit, they include, "the first observations of polarized tokamak electron, cyclotron radiation and development of diagnostics and thermal and nonthermal electronic distributions based on it." so you're that guy? %$* 13
what are you doing here? %$* 13
well, i guess that is the question, isn't it? %$* 202
but most seriously, i am a scientist, and i'm also a christian. %$* 202
i think both are very important parts of the way that we understand the world. %$* 202
and i think that's why this debate is so important. %$* 202
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our live audience, act as our judges. %$* 13
we ask you before the debate has ended to vote twice, once before you've heard the arguments and once again after you've heard the arguments. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved by the highest percentage will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so we would like to register the preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to the key pads at your seat, set of numbers one through three, and if you agree with the motion at this point, science refutes god, we want you to push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided or agnostic, push number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you've pushed a number in error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and we're going to hold the result of this first vote until the end of the debate. %$* 13
when you vote the second time, we'll compare the two numbers. %$* 13
and again the team whose numbers have moved by the highest percentage will be declared our winner. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so on to round one, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "science refutes god." and here to debate first in support of this motion, lawrence krauss. %$* 13
he is the director of the origins project and professor of physics at the school of earth and space exploration at arizona state university. %$* 13
he is an-- %$* 13
also an author of the best-selling book, a-- %$* 13
let me do that again so that it's clean for the radio broadcast because i really want to help you sell this book. %$* 13
yeah, you bet. %$* 199
you can take all the time you want. %$* 199
he is also the author of the best-selling book, "a universe from nothing." ladies and gentlemen, lawrence krauss. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 199
i actually wore this t-shirt for the subject of the debate. %$* 199
and it's the center of the debate. %$* 199
and it's clear. %$* 199
the motion is science refutes god. %$* 199
and michael and i have the distinct advantage here of arguing in favor of the motion because in fact we have evidence, reason, logic, rationality, and empirical methods on our side, whereas the opponents have vague hopes and fears, and they're arguing in favor of a motion that's hanging on for its existence by mere shreds of emotional and ideological spaghetti, much like this type provided by the flying spaghetti monster, one of the equally irrational gods which science provides no support for. %$* 199
but i first want to begin by clarifying the nature of the motion, because the motion isn't science disproves god. %$* 199
it's science refutes god. %$* 199
and that's very important because you can't disprove a notion that's basically vague and unfalsifiable. %$* 199
i could not-- %$* 199
there's no way to disprove the notion that god didn't create all of us 15 seconds ago with the memories of the amusing comments we heard before that. %$* 199
there's no way we can disprove that, okay. %$* 199
and that's really important to recognize that those kind of unfalsifiable notions are unfalsifiable, as i say. %$* 199
but we can ask, is it rational to expect that that's likely. %$* 199
and tonight i want to emphasize that 500 years of science have demonstrated that god, that vague notion, is not likely. %$* 199
it's irrational to believe in god. %$* 199
now, to refute god means refuting several claims. %$* 199
onethat are all based on faith, not evidence. %$* 199
one, that god is necessary, two, that there is evidence for god; and three, that that belief is rational. %$* 199
and the point is that the progress of science has shown over and over and over again that the answers to all those three questions are no. %$* 199
no, no, no. %$* 199
now, my own scientific field is cosmology. %$* 199
and that's the study of the origin and evolution of the universe as a whole. %$* 199
and it's where science and religion sort of confront each other. %$* 199
and creation myths have abounded throughout human history, and science confronts those creation myths. %$* 199
and we'll talk about that, i'm sure, at some point in the debate. %$* 199
but i want to point out that our opponents, i'm pretty sure, are going to argue first that one aspect of science that supports perhaps the belief in god is this notion that the universe is apparently fine-tuned for life. %$* 199
i hear that a lot, and because it was fine-tuned so life could exist. %$* 199
that is a remarkable and, in fact, cosmic misunderstanding, because it's the same kind of misunderstanding that led people to believe in special creation for life on earth before darwin. %$* 199
it looked like everything was designed for the environment in which it lived. %$* 199
but what darwin showed us was that a simple proposition, namely that there's genetic variation among a population combined with natural selection meant that you didn't need supernatural shenanigans, that in fact all the diversity of life on earth could arise from a single life form, by natural law. %$* 199
and he didn't know-- %$* 199
what he showed was it was plausible, based on the evidence-- %$* 199
he didn't know about dna.he didn't know about the details of genetic replication, but he showed it was plausible. %$* 199
and as i'll say, that's where we're at now as far as the understanding of the universe is concerned. %$* 199
now, our-- %$* 199
my opponents, i suspect, will argue the universe is equally fine-tuned for life, and they-- %$* 199
in fact, they will point out that certain fundamental parameters in nature, if they were different, we couldn't exist. %$* 199
or they may boldly assert that, in fact, certain of these parameters are so strange and unnatural that they must have been established with malice aforethought to ensure our existence. %$* 199
this too is an illusion. %$* 199
just as bees need to see the color of flowers but they're not designed to do it, if they couldn't see them, they couldn't get the nectar and reproduce. %$* 199
so what we're seeing is a version of cosmic natural selection. %$* 199
we would be quite surprised to find ourselves living in a universe in which we couldn't live. %$* 199
in fact, that might be evidence for god. %$* 199
but i want to point out that in fact the universe isn't particularly fine-tuned or conducive to life. %$* 199
most of the universe is rather inhospitable to life. %$* 199
and in fact-- %$* 199
perhaps the biggest fine-tuning problem in my own field of cosmology, something i'm, in fact, very proud to have proposed in a sense is that the energy of empty space is not zero. %$* 199
the weirdest thing you can imagine, that empty space weighs something, but remarkably the energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would na√Øvely predict. %$* 199
and if it were much bigger than we measure, it's true that galaxies couldn't form, and planets couldn't form, and intelligence squared debates couldn't happen. %$* 199
so the universe appears to be here because intelligence squared is here. %$* 199
now, that suggests religion perhaps, but the point is not that that claim of fine tuning is ridiculous because, in fact, if the energy of empty space was zero, which is a-- %$* 199
by far a more natural value, the universe would be a better place for life to live in. %$* 199
we all thought it was zero when i was a graduate student, because that was a natural value. %$* 199
if it was zero, the universe would be a better place. %$* 199
in fact, you can show the value that it has now makes the universe the worst of all possible universes to live in for the future of life. %$* 199
so, so much for a universe created for us. %$* 199
now, once darwin had removed the apparent need for god in evolution of life, the last bastion for god was the creation of the universe, how you can get something from nothing. %$* 199
and what-- %$* 199
we're in a remarkable situation of being in is precisely the same situation that darwin existed in 150 years ago, namely, we have a plausible explanation of how a universe could precisely come from nothing. %$* 199
if you asked, "what would be the characteristics of the universe that came from nothing by natural laws? %$* 199
" it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we observe, and it didn't have to be that way. %$* 199
it could have been another way. %$* 199
and by nothing-- %$* 199
and it-- %$* 199
the-- %$* 199
my opponents will say that by nothing, i'm not talking about nothing, but i'm talking about nothing, no particles, no radiation, no space, no time, and even no laws of physics. %$* 199
our-- %$* 199
my opponents might argue that the multiverse, which our universe might have spontaneously been created in, was created by physicists because they don't like god, because it's eternal and exists outside our universe, those same characteristics that god is supposed to have. %$* 199
but it wasn't created because we don't like god, although i don't like god. %$* 199
it was-- %$* 199
we'd been driven to it by measurements. %$* 199
in fact, i don't even like the multiverse, but i've learned to force my beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality. %$* 199
that's where science differs from religion. %$* 199
there do remain deep philosophical and seismic questions that are unanswered, but god is not required or useful to explain any of them. %$* 199
and, therefore, to conclude, science has taught us that we don't need god to create a universe, that there's no evidence for god, that the specific sides of the claims of those who require god disagree with empirical evidence, and it's irrational. %$* 199
science refutes god, so clearly you should vote for our side. %$* 199
thank you. %$* 199
thank you, lawrence krauss. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "science refutes god." and here to speak against the motion, ian hutchinson. %$* 13
he is a professor of nuclear science and engineering at mit and the author of "monopolizing knowledge: the scientist refutes religion denying reason destroying scientism." %$* 13
thank you for the opportunity to be with you tonight and to explain why science does not refute god. %$* 202
let's agree that this motion is not about whether, for example, the latest sociological theories disprove the gods and goddesses of ancient greek mythology. %$* 202
no, it's about whether modern natural science exemplified by things like physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and so on rule out thoughtful theism. %$* 202
the god i'm going to discuss is the god of christianity, because i'm a follower of jesus, but my side's job is not to convince you of the truth of christianity, although i think it is true. %$* 202
our job is just to show that christianity's god is not refuted by science. %$* 202
now, obviously there are some religious beliefs that are ruled out by science, for example, the belief that the earth is stationary and orbited by the sun, moon, and stars. %$* 202
that is disproved by science, and perhaps prior to the 17th century, most christians held a belief like that, as did most other people. %$* 202
but that stationary earth belief is not in the least central to the christian message and doctrine. %$* 202
to establish the motion, what our opponents have to do is to show that some central tenet of what christians believe about god is impossible or at least highly implausible in the light of science, and that's a tall order. %$* 202
actually, they can't even come close. %$* 202
but let me dispense with a couple of the most plausible sounding arguments. %$* 202
i'll illustrate one common argument from the writing of an mit colleague, alan lightman, who wrote in the salon magazine last year, he said, "the central doctrine of science is the view that the laws of nature are inviolable." he said, "science and god are compatible as long as the latter, god, is content to stand on the sidelines once the universe has begun."now, i certainly shall not shrink the god that i advocate down into a deistic, non- interventionist first cause. %$* 202
no, the god i'm interested in is personal and active in the world. %$* 202
so the question is, "how do i answer alan lightman? %$* 202
" it's straight forward. %$* 202
the presumption that the laws of nature are inviolable is just not a doctrine of science. %$* 202
alan and a lot of other people are just wrong about that. %$* 202
science's method and its program is to describe the universe insofar as it is repeatable and follows universal laws, but science hasn't got the slightest need to extrapolate that method and program into a presumption that everything that happens must be so describable. %$* 202
and the majority of the scientific heroes of history did not make that presumption. %$* 202
great scientists like those that were recited before, newton, boyle, dalton, faraday, maxwell, were christian believers who saw their science as compatible with a god who is active in the world and, on occasion, works miracles that go beyond the laws that they were discovering. %$* 202
so the notion that for science to function, or in order to be a successful scientist, it is necessary to believe in universal laws, is indisputably disproved by history. %$* 202
a second frequent critique of belief in god is that it is based on irrational faith rather than evidence. %$* 202
and this, of course, is a fallacy. %$* 202
belief in god is often highly rational. %$* 202
the universities that were established between, say, the 14th and the 18th centuries, were places of explicitly religious rationality and learning. %$* 202
actually, evidence is just one type of reason for belief in god, and there is a loss of evidence for christianity. %$* 202
but what the critics mean, i think, is-- %$* 202
they're saying there's no scientific evidence for god. %$* 202
and that goes to the heart of this question and the myth that science has somehow refuted god. %$* 202
actually, there are some things we've learned about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for god were non-existent. %$* 202
would that mean that science refutes god, or would it even mean and support the more modest claim that there's no evidence for god? %$* 202
not at all. %$* 202
god is mostly not a scientific question, and so the evidence for god is mostly not scientific. %$* 202
if you insist that scientific evidence is the only type you will count, then you put out of business not just religion, but a vast range of other human knowledge, like history, or the law, or politics, or philosophy, or literature. %$* 202
there's no scientific way to prove that caesar crossed the rubicon; there's no scientific way to judge the justice of a verdict; there isn't even a scientific way to detect a true thought. %$* 202
but all of these things are real cognitive questions whose answers are important and often indisputable. %$* 202
and questions about god are usually of the same type, not scientific. %$* 202
about 50 years ago, yuri gagarin became the first human in space. %$* 202
soviet president nikita khrushchev told the communist party, anti-religionist, "gagarin flew into space but he didn't find any god there." well, what a silly argument. %$* 202
but most of the arguments behind the view that science has refuted god are of much the same type. %$* 202
if science, in its endeavors, fails to detect god, so what? %$* 202
thoughtful christians don't believe that god is a natural phenomenon or a law of nature to be established by scientific investigation. %$* 202
science, for all of its power, is utterly incompetent to refute god. %$* 202
thank you, ian hutchinson. %$* 13
a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing it out over this motion: "science refutes god." you have heard two of the speakers so far, and now onto the third. %$* 13
"science refutes god." and here to speak in support of the motion, michael shermer. %$* 13
he is the founding publisher of skeptic magazine, executive director of the skeptics society, a monthly columnist for scientific american and the author of "the believing brain." ladies and gentlemen, michael shermer. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 200
thank you. %$* 200
i'm going to start off with a thought experiment. %$* 200
imagine you're a hominid on the plains of africa 3.5 million years ago. %$* 200
you're a tiny little australopithecus afarensis, little brain. %$* 200
your name is lucy. %$* 200
thank you. %$* 200
a lot of people in the midwest don't get that. %$* 200
what? %$* 200
not that lucy, the other one. %$* 200
and you hear a rustle in the grass. %$* 200
is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind? %$* 200
if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator, and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error in cognition. %$* 200
a false positive. %$* 200
you thought the wind was connected to something, and it wasn't. %$* 200
a was connected to b, and it wasn't. %$* 200
so that's a false positive. %$* 200
but that's relatively harmless. %$* 200
but if you think that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch. %$* 200
congratulations. %$* 200
you've just been given a darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing. %$* 200
and we are the descendants of those who are most likely to make type one errors, false-positives, versus type two errors, false-negatives. %$* 200
that is to say, why can't you just stay in the grass and collect enough data to get the answer right? %$* 200
and the answer is that predators don't wait around for prey animals to collect more data. %$* 200
that's why they stalk and sneak up on their prey animals, so they can't get enough data. %$* 200
so we evolve the propensity to make snap decisions and make one kind of error more likely than another kind of error. %$* 200
and that kind of error, that false positive, that's superstition. %$* 200
that's magical thinking. %$* 200
that's assuming a is connected to b.it's a true pattern, and it isn't, and you're wrong. %$* 200
that's the basis of finding false patterns like gods. %$* 200
now, what's the difference between the wind and a dangerous predator? %$* 200
the wind is an inanimate force. %$* 200
a dangerous predator is an intentional agent. %$* 200
and his intention is to eat me, and that can't be good. %$* 200
so what we also do in addition to finding these meaningful patterns is infuse in them agency. %$* 200
that is, it's alive. %$* 200
it's real, it has intention, and its intention is not good, so i better assume it's real. %$* 200
and this is the basis of animism and spiritism and polytheism and monotheism and the belief in angels and aliens and demons and spirits and poltergeists and gods. %$* 200
gods are invisible agents who run the world, who control things, who create these patterns, who are these patterns that we use to explain things. %$* 200
all cultures everywhere in the world have created god beliefs. %$* 200
gods with these intentional-- %$* 200
that are intentional agents. %$* 200
so my question tonight is not like in my book, why do so many people believe in god, here is a theory, which i just outlined for you. %$* 200
but for tonight, i want to ask, what's more likely, that our opponents here happen to pick the right god and the right religion among all the-- %$* 200
about 10,000 different religions and about a thousand different gods the humans have constructed socially, anthropologically, psychologically in the last 10,000 years. %$* 200
10,000 different religions, a thousand different gods. %$* 200
our opponents agree with us that 999 of those gods are false gods. %$* 200
they are atheists like we are atheists. %$* 200
what i'm asking you to do is just go one god further with us. %$* 200
so here's what happened. %$* 200
about 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, these small bands of hunter- gathers began to coalesce into chiefdoms and states. %$* 200
as long as the numbers are small, informal means of behavior control and moral enforcement operate quite well. %$* 200
as soon as the numbers are too large for these informal means, shunning, making people feel guilty, gossiping about them, making them feel embarrassed for their bad behavior, as soon as the population are big, there's too much opportunity for free riding and for cheating the system and taking advantage of it and getting away with it. %$* 200
so two institutions evolved, government to set up a set of rules, and everybody gets a copy; and religion in case you think you got away with it, you didn't because there's an eye in the sky that those all and sees all and keeps track of this. %$* 200
so this is the second part of how humans construct religions and gods, because we need it for moral enforcement. %$* 200
it just so happens, by contingency and chance, religion and government was the first on the scene. %$* 200
now, what's happened in the last several centuries, since the enlightenment, in addition to the trajectory that professor krauss outlined for you, science displacing religion as the primary means of explaining how the world works, something else has also happened. %$* 200
we've slowly but ineluctably replaced religion as the primary source of our morals and came up with the clever idea that you actually have to have a reason why you have certain moral principles, and we're going to write certain laws. %$* 200
you actually have to give evidence for why you think this is a good law or a bad law or a good moral principle or a bad moral principle. %$* 200
and that has been the trajectory of the enlightenment since about 200 years ago. %$* 200
and so again, what's more likely, that one of them happens to be the one true religion, and the one true god, and all those others that have been constructed are false gods or that, as we can clearly see, anthropologically, socially, psychologically and so on, this is what people do to get along. %$* 200
they construct religions. %$* 200
they construct moral systems and so on. %$* 200
we now know that we can do this without gods. %$* 200
in fact, we do it quite well without gods. %$* 200
northern european countries do just fine with much lower rates of religiosity than we have. %$* 200
it is possible to do it, and that is what we've been doing. %$* 200
now, i want to finish with just one comment on the resurrection since ian brought that up. %$* 200
let me just-- %$* 200
leaving aside the scientific evidence for this, just think about what it is that is being said here. %$* 200
they are monotheists. %$* 200
they believe that there's just one god and that jesus is god manifest on earth. %$* 200
and he is your savior, and you accept him for redeeming us for sins we never committed. %$* 200
somebody else in the past committed them. %$* 200
so as i understand this, god sacrifices himself to himself to save us from himself. %$* 200
if that sounds as incomprehensible to you as it does to me, i urge to you vote for our side. %$* 200
thank you. %$* 200
thank you, michael shermer. %$* 13
and our motion is "science refutes god." and now our final debater speaking against this motion, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
he is the best-selling of many books including, "what's so great about christianity." he's also the director of the documentary "2016: obama's america." and a former policy analyst in the reagan white house. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 201
how would one go about refuting the idea-- %$* 201
establishing the idea that science refutes god? %$* 201
first of all, you'd have to show that belief in god was, if not impossible, unreasonable. %$* 201
and, therefore, you'd have to show that all the people in the world who believe in god are also being unreasonable and that science has established this not at some point in the future, but has established it already. %$* 201
science has refuted god right now. %$* 201
now, on the face of it, this is such an odd and difficult and preposterous enterprise. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because actually the questions to which god is the answer are really fundamentally not scientific questions. %$* 201
here is what i mean. %$* 201
here we are as human beings. %$* 201
we're thrown into the world. %$* 201
and we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a universe? %$* 201
second, what's our purpose? %$* 201
what are we doing here? %$* 201
third, what's going to come after? %$* 201
we're going to die, but what next? %$* 201
now i ask you, what are the scientific answers to those questions? %$* 201
and in fact, the answers are, from science, don't have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because none of those questions is amenable to being decided empirically. %$* 201
science can show how we got a universe but not why. %$* 201
on the question of what our purpose is here, science is completely silent. %$* 201
moral issues are in a way outside the province of science. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be. %$* 201
and finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical evidence can science provide on either side of that question? %$* 201
so because science is in no position to refute god, what we get from the other side is pop psychology. %$* 201
and we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years. %$* 201
it's an effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation. %$* 201
you remember a few decades ago freud basically said that god and religion could be dismissed as wishful thinking, "we wish for a better world and so we make one up." well, that would kind of explain heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really wouldn't explain why major religions have invented hell. %$* 201
who would wish for that? %$* 201
hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life. %$* 201
and then you've heard here people like richard dawkins say, "well, belief in god depends on where you're born. %$* 201
if you're born in afghanistan you're going to be a muslim. %$* 201
if you're born in tulsa, oklahoma, you're likely to be a christian." michael shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods. %$* 201
but the sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief. %$* 201
i'm sure that people who are born in oxford, england, are most likely to believe in darwin's theory of evolution than people who are born in oxford, mississippi. %$* 201
i'm sure people who are born in new york are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in new guinea. %$* 201
what does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true? %$* 201
nothing. %$* 201
the genesis of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be sustained as a matter of argument. %$* 201
the reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about darwin because the last good argument against god came out in 1850-- %$* 201
in the 1850s, science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite direction. %$* 201
and, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way. %$* 201
when the discovery of the big bang came-- %$* 201
this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of american and western science-- %$* 201
so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning. %$* 201
in other words, this was something that the ancient hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a single scientific experiment. %$* 201
by the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies. %$* 201
other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient hebrews said, "no, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe."by the way, that's almost identical to what lawrence krauss said, "first, there was nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completely consistent to what-- %$* 201
with what christians believe, and exactly said by the ancient hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the basis of, "god told us." and the astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries. %$* 201
now, the fine-tuned universe is-- %$* 201
has become now a tremendous embarrassment to atheism. %$* 201
why? %$* 201
because ultimately it shows that the laws and constants of nature are fine-tuned, not only for the existence of life, but specifically for human life. %$* 201
i want to note that this is an argument completely immune to darwinian attack. %$* 201
this is not about whether the horse, the dog, and the wolf had a common ancestor. %$* 201
let's remember that evolution, powerful theory as it is, is not a theory of life. %$* 201
it is only a theory of transitions between life forms. %$* 201
it's not about the origin of life, it's simply about how life form a gave rise to life form b.and the fact is that there have to be certain conditions, self-replicating cells, an old universe, an old earth that are necessary for evolution to take place. %$* 201
in other words, the fine-tuned universe is a precondition of darwinian evolution itself. %$* 201
we are living at a time when religious believers do not need to be afraid of science; they should, as i do, embrace science and welcome science because correctly understood, far from pointing away from god, science thrillingly points to god. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 201
thank you. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where the motion is "science refutes god." now, keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, remember we're going to ask you to vote again at the conclusion and the team that has changed the most minds at the end of the debate will declared our winner. %$* 13
now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two, they're arguing out this motion: science refutes god. %$* 13
lawrence krauss and michael shermer are arguing for the motion, and they are basically making the argument-- %$* 13
number one, they're saying they are not arguing that science disproves god, but that science makes the possibility of the existence very, very unlikely. %$* 13
they point out, their argument, that the universe is so badly designed, actually, for human life, that it's highly unlikely that anybody would've thought this up. %$* 13
they also say that god is a human creation, that this is established in history, psychology, anthropology, and that in the past god was the answer to a question that science has now answered more and more successfully. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, dinesh d'souza and ian hutchinson, are making the argument that belief in god, number one, is very rational; number two, that there is evidence for the existence of god, it's just not evidence that one would call scientific. %$* 13
that, in fact, science is not capable of answering the kinds of questions that god answers, such as, "why are we here? %$* 13
" the "why? %$* 13
" questions, where do we go afterwards? %$* 13
they also say that the arguments being made on the-- %$* 13
by the other side, that are based on social sciences like anthropology and psychology, are pop science; and therefore, i believe, to be disqualified. %$* 13
so we're going to take questions from you and from me, but i want to start by actually getting to something i'm very curious about, and that's the issue of miracles. %$* 13
i want to put to this side, you in particular, ian hutchinson, who is arguing against the notion that science refutes god, what is a miracle if not a violation of the laws of physics? %$* 13
and is that what it is, in addition to all of its other implications? %$* 13
does it not violate the laws of physics? %$* 13
and if it does so, how does-- %$* 13
how is that even possible? %$* 13
and how does that fit into this argument? %$* 13
so what we call the laws of physics, from a christian point of view, are the way that god normally orders the universe. %$* 202
it's the normal behavior of things around about us. %$* 202
and boyle, who was one of the founders of the royal society, wrote a whole a book about what nature is, and what he advocated was that what we mean or should mean by "nature," is the normal course of events. %$* 202
now, of course, miracles are not the normal course of events. %$* 202
and, by the way, it didn't take science to tell us that; you know, people in the first century knew that people don't rise from the dead when they've been hung on crosses, and people knew that women don't bear children unless, well, you know what. %$* 202
you know, this is not something that modern science has been necessary to tell us. %$* 202
so, yes, miracles are abnormal events; usually, abnormal-- %$* 202
why does science not refute those things? %$* 13
as in-- %$* 13
it is simply not the case that you have to presume that the laws of nature are universally inviolable; it is simply not necessary to do science to do that. %$* 202
lawrence krauss. %$* 13
that's ridiculous. %$* 199
in fact, it's ridiculous to the science that you do. %$* 199
when you do science, you're presuming that the results of an experiment in your laboratory apply in another laboratory. %$* 199
the fundamental claim that-- %$* 199
if you just-- %$* 199
miracles in your particular religion-- %$* 199
it's kind of remarkable that these violations of the laws of nature only occurred before video cameras and intelligence squared and the internet, and that you have these remarkable violations of the laws of nature in a book, which i was really surprised to hear dinesh call a scientific document, the bible. %$* 199
i hope he really didn't mean that. %$* 199
st. %$* 199
augustine would be very upset with you, because he said the bible wasn't scientific. %$* 199
but these violations of the law of nature-- %$* 199
laws of nature only occurred at a time when there was no evidence for them-- %$* 199
but, lawrence-- %$* 13
and you believe them. %$* 199
lawrence, but is there a logical argument, again, that you can make against miracles? %$* 13
not the "i didn't see them and nobody's seen them lately" argument. %$* 13
but is there a logical argument you can make against them? %$* 13
our logic is determined by nature, not by what we'd like. %$* 199
and nature has told us that miracles don't happen. %$* 199
that's it. %$* 199
it's not what i want or what i think should be rational. %$* 199
it's, do they happen? %$* 199
and there's no evidence that they've ever happened. %$* 199
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
i think we have here a deep fallacy. %$* 201
and the fact that it remains a fallacy shows that what is being called science is actually hiding behind a philosophical principle. %$* 201
it was the philosopher hume who pointed out 200 years ago that from no amount of empirical generalizations, however large, can you draw a general law that is true as a matter of logic. %$* 201
what i mean is, it doesn't matter how often you measure something. %$* 201
let's say you measure the speed at which this pen falls down. %$* 201
you can measure it a million times. %$* 201
but you don't know that on a star ten light years away or in some other condition where you haven't measured it, that if you drop this pen, it will fall at the same speed. %$* 201
science presumes it. %$* 201
it doesn't prove-- %$* 201
we measure. %$* 199
i'm sorry. %$* 199
we measure it. %$* 199
let me finish it. %$* 201
right. %$* 201
but you can't measure it always and everywhere. %$* 201
and you haven't measured it 10,000 years ago. %$* 201
you're assuming that-- %$* 201
yes, we have. %$* 199
10,000-- %$* 201
no. %$* 201
you're assuming that 10,000 years ago it happened at the same speed. %$* 201
and your measurement is based on that. %$* 201
so hume's point is this: science provides general propositions based on experience, but he said we should always be willing to accept new experience that proves the opposite. %$* 201
a good example of this in western philosophy-- %$* 201
before you go to the example, let me let michael shermer come in and respond to where you've gone so far with that. %$* 13
sure. %$* 201
right. %$* 200
so like a popular thing in skeptic magazine, there's psychics and people that can telekinetically move objects with their mind or so on. %$* 200
and there's an example of this where there's a man who can move the cursor on his computer just by thinking about it. %$* 200
now, it turns out he's a quadriplegic, and he has a chip in his brain that enables him to do this. %$* 200
but if you don't know about the chip, it looks like a miracle. %$* 200
once you know the technology, it's no longer miraculous. %$* 200
this is arthur c.clarke's third law. %$* 200
any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. %$* 200
i contend that there's no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal. %$* 200
there's just the natural, the normal and the stuff we haven't explained yet. %$* 200
and when something unusual like that happens, we should go searching for the mechanism behind it. %$* 200
is there a chip in the brain? %$* 200
so if it's true that, say, god heals cancers or whatever due to prayer, this should be a measurable thing because this is what we-- %$* 200
but what about dinesh's point that just because something has happened 10,000 times and that that's your case, that it's always going to happen. %$* 13
and he's saying logically, you don't actually know that it's always going to happen just because it's happened 10,000 times. %$* 13
okay. %$* 200
fine, fine, fine. %$* 200
say that in fact that's very important. %$* 199
science-- %$* 199
i agree with you in that. %$* 199
science could only prove was wrong, not something that's absolute true. %$* 199
so you're right. %$* 199
if i drop a ball a million times, and it falls, i, in principle, could imagine an experience where it wouldn't. %$* 199
but it's highly likely it's going to fall the next time. %$* 199
but you use the keyword, "experience." we wait then for an experience that contradicts the known laws. %$* 199
so if tonight when i looked up at the sky, the stars rearranged themselves that i am here in aramaic or ancient greek or whatever you want, then i might say, you know, there's something to it. %$* 199
but the point is there's been no-- %$* 199
there's been no experience that violates the fact that the laws have existed throughout all time. %$* 199
lawrence, you haven't had such an experience. %$* 202

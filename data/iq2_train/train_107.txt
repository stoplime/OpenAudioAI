welcome. %$* 135
as is often the case, uh, in new york on evenings of public discourse, the event begins with a bad joke. %$* 135
but i’m going to begin this event with a dangerous joke that i overheard on a reporting assignment that i did out in california very recently. %$* 135
and i was in the company of some, of a very diverse group of very successful business people who were sitting around in california talking about issues of the day. %$* 135
and one just was dying to tell the following joke, which i will repeat. %$* 135
it’s not one that i would necessarily tell except in the context of this debate and what we’re going to be discussing tonight. %$* 135
it seems at the alamo – you know the alamo – at the conclusion of the defeat of the defenders of that fort in texas, jim bowie – who was one of the defenders – and one of his colleagues looked out the window and saw in the grounds of the fort the victorious mexicans swarming in. %$* 135
and bowie turned to his colleague and said, are we pouring concrete today? %$* 135
the laughter catches in your throat. %$* 135
and rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants that joke and its relevance, its humor, its whatever that sort of hit on that day was very, very meaningful to me. %$* 135
because it really sort of depicted for me, in a visceral kind of way, just how electrifying the immigration debate is, is in america right now. %$* 135
um, on the eve of an election year, we see an issue in which american culture, american race, american economics, america’s sense of its own notion of freedom, inclusion and what we are as a nation, the actual definition of what it means to be american is all tied up in this thorny knot called the immigration debate. %$* 135
um, and so it is in that context that i offer that very bad and dangerous joke tonight, um, to set the stage for what we hope will be a very, very lively event. %$* 135
some of you have come to these before, um, and know the rules of the road. %$* 135
others i will, um, like to lay out some of the details for all of you. %$* 135
now, you know, we like audience participation. %$* 135
we like the fact that this is done before a live audience. %$* 135
you’ll notice this is a radio show here, microphones all over onstage, microphones all over on the side. %$* 135
um, fill in the empty seats. %$* 135
move forward. %$* 135
kind of, you know, get, get collegial. %$* 135
um, and, uh, of course, as is always the case, turn off your cell phones and beepers. %$* 135
we kinda like the sound track we have for our program here. %$* 135
we don’t necessarily need an addition from rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants one of your electronic devices. %$* 135
um, we, of course, want questions from you. %$* 135
you have cards, i believe. %$* 135
does everyone see their cards that they have at their seat? %$* 135
um, we’re going to try something a little different on the questions this, this time around. %$* 135
we have pencils and let me just make sure that i get this right. %$* 135
now, if you have a question fill out your card. %$* 135
write the question. %$* 135
and unlike other debates, we’re going to do it a little bit differently. %$* 135
at the top either put your name, if you’re comfortable having me read your name or some way of identifying you. %$* 135
but i’m really, if it’s really hard to identify you i’m probably not going to use your question. %$* 135
so if you want your question used, even if you don’t want your name used, put donald duck at the top or something, just so i can at least say whoever said they’re donald duck, it’s your question. %$* 135
cause i’m not going to waste a lot of time going, the person who says that they’re wearing the green shirt in the fourth row. %$* 135
i’m not going to do that, okay? %$* 135
if you want your question answered a name or your name. %$* 135
um, the ushers will collect your cards and they’ll give you a new card so you can ask as many questions as you like. %$* 135
um, that is it. %$* 135
but obviously, we want something lively and wonderful and interesting. %$* 135
and, you know, the bar is high here because the debates that, uh, you have very previously attended have been rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants very, very successful. %$* 135
i’m thrilled to be here. %$* 135
i am john hockenberry. %$* 135
i, uh, previously you may know my name from, uh, national public radio. %$* 135
you may know it from, uh, nbc television. %$* 135
um, i would like to introduce our sponsor and sort of uber host for this, uh, entire series – uh, robert rosenkranz, who is chairman of the rosenkranz foundation and of course the sponsor of this evening’s debate. %$* 135
well, thank you very much, john. %$* 1
uh, dana wolfe, our executive producer, and i are very pleased to welcome you to tonight’s intelligence squared debate. %$* 1
immigration will almost certainly be a major issue in the next presidential election. %$* 1
it’s front page news when governor spitzer wants to issue driver’s licenses to illegal, uh, immigrants because these are our de facto identity cards. %$* 1
the very term illegal is emotionally charged – so much so that, uh, some of our panelists insisted on the word undocumented in our resolution. %$* 1
and yet the division and viewpoint does not fall along conventional liberal/conservative lines. %$* 1
in, in classical economics labor mobility benefits both the worker and his employer. %$* 1
and the gains seem obvious, just by a casual glance at our daily lives. %$* 1
consider the growing number of immigrant laborers, many from mexico and central america, who have taken up rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants housekeeping jobs, gardening, childcare jobs throughout the new york metropolitan area in recent years. %$* 1
and then consider the large number of immigrant ph.d.candidates, many of them asian and indian, who study science, engineering, mathematics and go on to key roles in our technology firms. %$* 1
at both ends of the economic spectrum, both the immigrants and those who employ them are better off. %$* 1
surely this enhances our economic dynamism and global competitiveness. %$* 1
on the other hand, these benefits may come with associated costs, particularly for the unskilled migrants. %$* 1
who bears the cost of their emergency medical care, of educating their children, of dealing with increased criminality and social unrest? %$* 1
and isn’t the term undocumented just a euphemism for illegal? %$* 1
and shouldn’t illegality be punished rather than rewarded? %$* 1
in a post-9/11 world don’t we need special vigilance about who crosses our borders? %$* 1
well, emotions notwithstanding, there are good arguments on both sides and a lot to learn from our outstanding panel. %$* 1
our moderator is john hockenberry. %$* 1
he is an author, columnist, veteran broadcast news correspondent and teller of very bad jokes. %$* 1
he holds an array of astonishing, an astonishing a %$* 1
array of awards or an array of astonishing awards and is the host of a new morning news program on wnyc, which is going to be starting early next year. %$* 1
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants john, the evening is yours. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 135
i’d like to welcome you all to the second debate of the second intelligence squared u.s.series. %$* 135
i want to give you a brief rundown of how the evening is going to go. %$* 135
first, the proposer of the motion – and let me remind you what the motion is. %$* 135
the motion for tonight is: let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants. %$* 135
the motion tonight is: let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants. %$* 135
so, first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 135
the opposition will follow. %$* 135
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 135
second, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks i will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience, questions that i may have, questions that are motivated by our panelists who may want to address each other directly. %$* 135
third, when the question and answer is complete, each debater will make a final statement, lasting not more than two minutes per person. %$* 135
and fourth, after the final closing statement is made you will vote on tonight’s motion with the key pad attached to the armrest at your seat. %$* 135
it looks like this. %$* 135
look down, you all have one. %$* 135
and fifth, and last, i will announce the results of the audience vote rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants and tell you which side carried the day. %$* 135
beforehand, from our panelists let’s start with a pre-debate vote. %$* 135
let’s do a little base line data here. %$* 135
pick up the key pad attached to your armrest on the left. %$* 135
remember this little guy here. %$* 135
for audience members sitting along the aisle to my right, your key pad is attached to the arm rest on your right side next to your neighbor’s. %$* 135
does everyone have a key pad? %$* 135
all right, when i prompt you, you will press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion or three if you are undecided. %$* 135
let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants – are you for, are you against or are you undecided? %$* 135
you may begin voting now. %$* 135
all right. %$* 135
you seem very, very methodical and definitive there. %$* 135
hmm, i’m very anxious to know the results. %$* 135
and i will reveal the results of your vote a little later in the evening. %$* 135
i will now introduce the panel. %$* 135
please hold your applause until all six are introduced. %$* 135
we are thrilled to have all six of these people with us. %$* 135
professor at the school of industrial and labor relations at cornell university, vernon m.briggs, jr. %$* 135
is the, is speaking for the motion. %$* 135
executive director of the center for immigration studies and contributor to the national review, mark krikorian, is also speaking for the motion. %$* 135
and the john m. olin fellow at the manhattan institute and contributing editor to city journal, heather mac donald, is also rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants speaking for the motion. %$* 135
against the motion, director of the cato institute center for trade policy studies, daniel t.griswold. %$* 135
speaking against the motion, president and founder of border angels, human rights activist, enrique morones. %$* 135
and also speaking against the motion, president and executive director of the asian-american justice center, karen k.narasaki. %$* 135
all right, let’s begin. %$* 135
as you recall, each speaker will have eight minutes. %$* 135
beginning tonight, speaking for the motion, heather mac donald. %$* 135
thank you very much, john. %$* 93
two principles require that we stop welcoming undocumented immigrants, otherwise known as illegal aliens – respect for the rule of law and respect for facts on the ground. %$* 93
the ongoing violation of our immigration laws has reversed the traditional roles in a sovereign nation. %$* 93
it is now people living outside our border who determine our immigration policy, not americans. %$* 93
the facts that result from this constant violation are these: a significant portion of the children of illegal mexicans and central americans are adopting an underclass culture, as anyone can verify for himself by looking at social statistics or spending time in heavily hispanic schools. %$* 93
until we figure out how to prevent this from happening our unrestricted immigration flows guarantee social problems for years into the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squaredus-undocumented immigrants future. %$* 93
now, on paper, our elected representatives continue to make our immigration rules. %$* 93
in reality, however, the power to determine who comes into the country and on what conditions, the most basic attribute of sovereignty, has passed from congress to the world at large. %$* 93
a net half million aliens enter the country illegally each year. %$* 93
once inside, they have enjoyed virtual immunity from any risk of penalties, as well as receiving a host of taxpayer benefits. %$* 93
such immunity is now considered an entitlement. %$* 93
any hint of enforcement, no matter how limited, inevitably provokes a massive outcry from immigrant advocates and immigrants themselves, that the government is behaving unfairly and, indeed, unlawfully. %$* 93
disapproving headlines will blare from newspapers across the country. %$* 93
quote: fear among immigrants spreads, unquote. %$* 93
mexican consul generals will complain bitterly that the government is psychologically abusing their countrymen by causing them to worry about their status. %$* 93
it seems that not only ill %$* 93
do illegal aliens have the right to live here without being deported, they also have the right to live without thinking that they face even a minimum risk of being deported. %$* 93
this sense of entitlement does a great injustice to the thousands of law-abiding foreigners who are patiently waiting to enter the country legally. %$* 93
and it makes a mockery of our laws. %$* 93
i would like to ask our esteemed opposing team if they think that anyone should ever be deported for coming into the country illegally or whether they believe that once across the border he should be home free. %$* 93
now, you may hear from mr. %$* 93
griswold tonight that our immigration laws are economically unwise. %$* 93
i and my colleagues vehemently disagree. %$* 93
but even if it were the case that controlling the border was bad economic policy, the sanctity of the law does not rest on whether it meets someone’s idea of optimal economic efficiency. %$* 93
until the american people decide to change the law it should be respected and enforced. %$* 93
you may also hear tonight that we have tried immigration enforcement and that it has failed and therefore that we have no choice other than to allow the present inflood to continue. %$* 93
in fact, until a few months ago, there has been almost no immigration enforcement in the interior of the country. %$* 93
in 2004 a mere three firms were issued fine notices for employing illegal aliens out of the hundreds of thousands of such law-breaking employers across the country. %$* 93
to be sure, the country has progressively put more agents on the border. %$* 93
but once an illegal alien got across the border he entered a three million square mile sanctuary zone. %$* 93
this means that mass deportation is not required to revive the effectiveness of our immigration laws. %$* 93
the illegal population has burgeoned precisely because illegals assume they face absolutely no risk of enforcement, as the complaints about psychologically harassing illegal aliens with de minimis enforcement show. %$* 93
increase that risk even slightly and calculations change. %$* 93
after 9/11, the department of homeland security deported fifteen hundred illegal pakistanis living in, in new york, leading fifteen thousand more to leave on their own. %$* 93
a modest increase in enforcement would result in a similar reduction over time of the broader illegal alien population. %$* 93
the second principle supporting tonight’s motion is respect for facts on the ground. %$* 93
those facts show that unrestrained illegal immigration is producing an underclass culture among many children of hispanic illegal aliens. %$* 93
talk to students in any heavily latino school and you’ll hear something like this – told to me by an undocumented guatemalan girl in los angeles – quote: "most of the students i hung out with when i started school have dropped out. %$* 93
others got kicked out or got into drugs. %$* 93
five graduated and four homegirls got pregnant." this testimony is perfectly representative. %$* 93
hispanics now have the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country. %$* 93
moreover, fifty percent of hispanic children are born out of wedlock, a rate two times that of whites and three times that of asians. %$* 93
the stigma against unmarried child-rearing among teens has virtually disappeared. %$* 93
hispanics have the highest school dropout rate in the country – fifty percent. %$* 93
and gang life is sucking in large numbers of latino youth. %$* 93
the incarceration rate of mexican-americans jumps eightfold between the first and second generation, resulting in an incarceration rate three and a half times that of whites. %$* 93
gang counselors in schools from washington, d.c. to san diego – %$* 93
despair at the fact that younger and younger kids are joining gangs. %$* 93
to be sure, most hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them. %$* 93
but as long as many of the children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values, maintaining the current high levels of illegal entry will bring in its wake rising welfare and crime. %$* 93
in conclusion, we should continue to welcome legal immigrants who have respected american law from the moment they entered the country and in the way they entered it. %$* 93
but it is an insult to them to accord the same privileges to so-called undocumented immigrants who have chosen to flout the law. %$* 93
and it is not in the country’s self-interest to do so. %$* 93
thank you very much. %$* 93
one. %$* 135
despair at the fact that younger and younger kids are joining gangs. %$* 93
to be sure, most hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them. %$* 93
but as long as many of the children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values, maintaining the current high levels of illegal entry will bring in its wake rising welfare and crime. %$* 93
in conclusion, we should continue to welcome legal immigrants who have respected american law from the moment they entered the country and in the way they entered it. %$* 93
but it is an insult to them to accord the same privileges to so-called undocumented immigrants who have chosen to flout the law. %$* 93
and it is not in the country’s self-interest to do so. %$* 93
thank you very much. %$* 93
thank you, heather mac donald, speaking for the resolution. %$* 135
now, to speak against the resolution, daniel griswold. %$* 135
well, thank you, everybody, for coming out tonight. %$* 338
uh, first i want to lodge a protest at the, uh, proposition that we’re debating. %$* 338
it’s a little bit like, uh, have you stopped beating your wife? %$* 338
, kind of question. %$* 338
i don’t think anybody up here is thrilled about having illegal immigrants in the united states. %$* 338
our side would like to see them able to come legally. %$* 338
and i’d like you to think of the motion as, uh, let’s stop welcoming more legal immigration. %$* 338
and i’d urge you to vote against it. %$* 338
immigrants have made the united states a prosperous, dynamic and free country. %$* 338
they have throughout our history, they continue to do so today – both on the higher end of the skills spectrum – but i will argue tonight that low-skilled immigrants are also benefiting the united states. %$* 338
there are two powerful economic and demographic trends, two very positive ones, that are driving low- skilled immigration to the united states. %$* 338
on the demand side, our economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs every year for low-skilled workers in fields like retail, cleaning, landscaping, food preparation. %$* 338
and at the same time, the supply of americans who traditionally filled these jobs – americans without a high school diploma – has been dropping steadily. %$* 338
we’re getting older, we’re getting better educated. %$* 338
uh, less than ten percent of americans, adult americans, do not have a high school diploma, compared to fifty percent in the early 1960s. %$* 338
4.6 million fewer americans are in the work force without a high school diploma today than just a decade ago. %$* 338
so we have a, a structural mismatch between demand and supply in our economy. %$* 338
and yet there’s no legal channel for a peaceful, hardworking twenty-four year old mexican or central american to come into the united states legally and fill these jobs that there are simply not enough americans, uh, there to fill. %$* 338
and yes, we have tried enforcement and it’s failed. %$* 338
we have ramped up real spending on enforcement six-fold in the last two decades, line watch hours at the border eight-fold. %$* 338
we’ve built walls for miles into the desert. %$* 338
we have gone through periods of increased interior enforcement in the late nineties and now again. %$* 338
it has made no dent. %$* 338
enforcement without reform is doomed to fail. %$* 338
it has failed in the past and it continues to fail. %$* 338
you know, we rounded up a few thousand, uh, workers at a chicken processing plant, uh, in georgia a while back. %$* 338
you know, two thousand down, eight million to go. %$* 338
it’s a futile exercise. %$* 338
there have been perverse consequences. %$* 338
because of our enforcement those trying to get in are actually, uh, more successful because they’re going through more remote regions in the desert. %$* 338
it’s more dangerous. %$* 338
the death rate has tripled. %$* 338
three or four hundred people are dying every year for the crime of wanting a better job and trying to cross the border. %$* 338
and here’s the irony: once they’re in they’re more likely to stay. %$* 338
because of the expense and risk of crossing the border once they’re in they tend to stay. %$* 338
traditionally we’ve had a strong circular component to mexican migration. %$* 338
eighty percent of them who came here eventually went back home, uh, as temporary immigrants. %$* 338
and we’ve interrupted that now and i think a legalization program would restore that circular flow. %$* 338
the only answer is immigration reform. %$* 338
we need to change the law. %$* 338
this is a broken, dysfunctional law. %$* 338
we need to change the law. %$* 338
you know, uh, and i think we need to both create a temporary worker program and legalize those who are here. %$* 338
we’re not talking amnesty. %$* 338
they would pay a fine, they would serve probation. %$* 338
that’s the penalty for a misdemeanor. %$* 338
it’s not a felony. %$* 338
it’s not a crime to be here. %$* 338
it’s a civil infraction. %$* 338
the punishment should fit the crime. %$* 338
the immigration reform and control act of 1986, of course, did, did none of that. %$* 338
uh, but the missing piece was that it had no temporary worker program, no provision for legalizing future workers, and it failed. %$* 338
let’s not make that mistake again. %$* 338
back in the 1950s we had a problem with illegal immigration. %$* 338
we had the bracero program but the visas were insufficient. %$* 338
we dramatically increased the visas and illegal immigration dropped by ninety-five percent. %$* 338
our side’s not talking about letting in more immigrants. %$* 338
we’re talking about turning in a flow of illegal and a population of illegal immigrants into a legal flow and population of i %$* 338
of immigrants. %$* 338
you’ll hear the argument from the other side that this is bad for low-skilled americans. %$* 338
well, if you’re twenty- five years old and you don’t have a high school diploma you’re getting it from all sides. %$* 338
the best thing you can do is stay in school. %$* 338
you’ll get a thirty-eight percent raise just over somebody who’s dropped out. %$* 338
so it’s, the answer isn’t to build walls. %$* 338
it’s to encourage people to stay in school. %$* 338
you’ll hear about the fiscal and social costs and you’ve already heard that. %$* 338
uh, i just don’t see it. %$* 338
yes, low-skilled workers tend to consume more in government services than they pay in taxes, but i think the other side exaggerates those costs. %$* 338
the costs are manageable. %$* 338
we can control access to the welfare state. %$* 338
and they’re overwhelmed by the economic benefits to having a more, uh, expansive, uh, dynamic economy. %$* 338
the social costs: you know, heather talked about this swelling underclass. %$* 338
i just don’t see it. %$* 338
in the last decade the poverty rate is down in the united states. %$* 338
cri %$* 338
crime is down by a third from the early 1990s – and this is with a doubling of the illegal immigrant population. %$* 338
the number of u.s. households headed by somebody without a high school diploma has dropped by more than ten percent, uh, in the last decade. %$* 338
so we have a shrinking underclass, uh, in this country and immigrants are helping to create, uh, opportunities throughout our economy. %$* 338
the answer, my friends, is to fence off the welfare state, not to fence off our country. %$* 338
let me end by talking a little bit about national security. %$* 338
and i don’t need to remind people in new york how important that is. %$* 338
none of us want to see a repeat of september 11th. %$* 338
i think a sensible immigration reform program would enhance our security and bring order to the border. %$* 338
this is a very important thing. %$* 338
we would begin to drain the swamp of smuggling and document fraud that can facilitate, uh, terrorism. %$* 338
we’d encourage people to come forward, announce themselves to authorities, to cooperate, uh, with the police rather than living in the shadows and being afraid. %$* 338
and also we would free up resources to go after the real criminals and terrorists. %$* 338
uh, i think that’s one reason why our homeland, uh, security boss, uh, michael chertoff, has been such a strong supporter of immigration reform. %$* 338
it would make his job easier. %$* 338
as he told congress recently, uh, immigration reform would, quote, "dramatically reduce the pressure on our borders, aid our economy and ease the task of our law enforcement agents inside the country." what in the world is our homeland security department doing using its scarce resources going after janitors and dishwashers and meat packers when it should be going after criminals and terrorists? %$* 338
we need to stop wasting our dollars, manpower and lives in a futile effort to close our borders and turn away hardworking, peaceful immigrants. %$* 338
we need to change the law – %$* 338
so that our country can welcome more legal immigrants to help us grow. %$* 338
and let me just end with a world about the rule of law. %$* 338
i’m all for enforcing the law. %$* 338
i’m all for obeying the law. %$* 338
but the law must be reasonable. %$* 338
it must be consistent with how normal people live their lives. %$* 338
in the 1930s we had alcohol prohibition. %$* 338
it made criminals out of millions of people who just wanted a drink after dinner. %$* 338
the american frontier was settled by illegal squatters and instead of clearing them off we passed the homestead act. %$* 338
uh, we need to change the law so that our immigration law better reflects our needs as an economy, our need for a more secure nation and our highest values. %$* 338
thank you very much. %$* 338
one. %$* 135
so that our country can welcome more legal immigrants to help us grow. %$* 338
and let me just end with a world about the rule of law. %$* 338
i’m all for enforcing the law. %$* 338
i’m all for obeying the law. %$* 338
but the law must be reasonable. %$* 338
it must be consistent with how normal people live their lives. %$* 338

uh, we need to change the law so that our immigration law better reflects our needs as an economy, our need for a more secure nation and our highest values. %$* 338
thank you very much. %$* 338
thank you. %$* 135
daniel griswold, speaking against the resolution. %$* 135
i want to remind the audience if you have a question don’t wait. %$* 135
jot it down on your card, pass it to the ushers on the aisles and you can ask for another card so that, uh, it’s not a one shot deal here. %$* 135
uh, we definitely want to encourage your questions for the question and answer part of the program. %$* 135
we continue now. %$* 135
speaking for the resolution, vernon briggs. %$* 135
thank you very much. %$* 339
it’s a pleasure to be here. %$* 339
please don’t let the other side confuse you. %$* 339
this is not about legal immigration. %$* 339
there’s a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration. %$* 339
the topic tonight, which the vote is supposed to be on, is illegal im %$* 339
immigration-- %$* 339
undocumented workers, if you want to call them that – but illegal immigration. %$* 339
that’s the issue and that’s the principle that i’m, uh, uh, that i’m in favor of stopping. %$* 339
ille %$* 339
and there are three reasons, basically. %$* 339
and i want to elaborate on each in a moment. %$* 339
the first is that illegal immigration is not a victim %$* 339
victimless crime. %$* 339
there are people who lose and lose in big ways. %$* 339
and these are the most vulnerable people in our society – not the privileged, not the well-off, who %$* 339
whom government is suppo %$* 339
does a very, a pretty good job of protecting – but the most vulnerable, the unskilled, the poorly educated, the poorly trained, disproportionately youth, disproportionate minority, disproportionately women who bear the, the competition with illegal immigrants. %$* 339
and they’re hurt very badly. %$* 339
just because some people win and other people lose doesn’t mean it’s on average, nothing happens. %$* 339
it’s a very, it has a very detrimental impact on those who lose. %$* 339
secondly, and i to go back and talk about a moment, illegal immigration does erode one of the basic pillars of this society – the, the rule of law. %$* 339
and when we make mockeries of our laws we br %$* 339
we, we engender, we, we, we encourage cynicism about the society in which we live in. %$* 339
what’s the sense of passing laws if nobody obeys them? %$* 339
and lastly, i want to talk about the fact that illegal immigration exposes in a very obvious way the seamier side of our wonderful democracy. %$* 339
uh, the willingness of some to tolerate the exploitation of human beings, uh, in our society, to find some ways to rationalize it. %$* 339
and the failure to stop this, these sores allows them then to, to fester and make conditions in this country much worse. %$* 339
it breeds cynicism about what our really core values of this nation are. %$* 339
but before i elaborate on those i want to say briefly how i got involved with this. %$* 339
i was invi %$* 339
i became involved in this when i was a very young professor teaching at the university of texas, when a man named cesar chavez came through austin on the way to try to organize farm workers in south texas in 1966. %$* 339
and i joined with that movement and i went down to the border for the first time. %$* 339
i was not a texan. %$* 339
i saw the border and i knew right away that the first day i was on the picket line that this strike was lost. %$* 339
we were overwhelmed by strike breakers and i’m saying to this day those, those people are still not organized in south texas. %$* 339
and, uh, from those years in the sixties and seventies there was no greater spokesman for ending illegal immigration in this country than cesar chavez, who sued the carter administration for, uh, for its unwillingness to enforce immigration laws before we even had employer sanctions. %$* 339
just trying to say these people shouldn’t be in here. %$* 339
that was chavez’s line. %$* 339
and he believed it very strongly in those days when he was actively trying to organize farm workers. %$* 339
and he certainly made a big impression on me for the rest of my life. %$* 339
it’s also the case that i believe the position that we’re arguing is supported by the overwhelming balance of re %$* 339
of research and findings about the adverse impact of illegal immigration on individuals and on our society. %$* 339
i want to elaborate on the three points now. %$* 339
first of all, with respect to adverse impact, there are ninety million – in a newspaper article just in last week’s ithaca journal – ninety million people that are adults in a population in the united states who only have only a high school diploma or less – ninety million. %$* 339
that’s half of the adult population of the entire country. %$* 339
of that number, fifty million are in the civilian labor force. %$* 339
almost one-third of the labor force doesn’t, has only a high school diploma or less. %$* 339
the problem this country faces, as this article makes, discusses very clearly, is that we have an over-supply of unqualified people in the country. %$* 339
it’s not that we have a shortage of unskilled workers that we need undocumented workers. %$* 339
and that over-supply is the group that are so adversely affected by illegal immigration. %$* 339
those are the people overwhelmingly who are adversely affected in terms of their wage depression and limited opportunities. %$* 339
they’re the ones who have to compete with illegal immigration, immigrants for jobs. %$* 339
uh, and that’s the ones we should, would be concerned with – the people that had the highest unemployment rates. %$* 339
the highest unemployment rates in the united states are those people in the high school grades, or high school-less, uh, uh, uh, cohort. %$* 339
uh, the unemployment rate is, is over, it’s almost six percent for people without high school diplomas and for those people in some groups, even blacks without high school diplomas, it’s all %$* 339
it’s, it’s twelve percent right now. %$* 339
so it’s hard to make any argument that there is a great shortage of unskilled workers when the highest unemployment rates in the united states are held by those who have the lowest level of education. %$* 339
just what we’d expect, but the other side makes it out as if there’s a great shortage of unskilled workers in this country that would document, that would, uh, warrant the, uh, the coming of undocumented workers. %$* 339
that is absolutely not true. %$* 339
absolutely not true. %$* 339
this, uh, this labor market is in surplus and that’s the problem. %$* 339
why income levels at the bottom, uh, don’t go up, wages at the bottom don’t go up, why income distribution in this country is coming, uh, increasingly skewed, heading toward greater inequality. %$* 339
it’s, uh, and it’s, it’s a very dangerous thing for a society to have happen to it. %$* 339
uh, we all know that if undocumented workers were pouring into the professional and legal ranks of this country, if they were coming into the professor ranks or the lawyer ranks or the doctors’ ranks or the business executive ranks, this issue would have been solved a long time ago. %$* 339
we all understand very clearly that this, uh, that the undocumented workers coming into the legal profession or the doctors’ profession five hundred thousand a year, was not good for the doctors in this country or the lawyers in this country who have to invest, uh, invest in their education and training and the, all the rest of it to get to those positions. %$* 339
undocumented, not legal immigrants, but undocumented, illegal immigrants. %$* 339
but somehow when it comes to low-wage workers, low-skilled workers, farm workers, maids, yardmen and all the rest of these things – landscapers and restaurant employees and hotel employees – people forget about the laws of economics – that, uh, that, that, uh, increasing the supply of those workers when you have unemployment already, of high unemployment rates already in those markets, can only depress wages and working conditions and make conditions worse for those at the bottom of our society, and society. %$* 339
so, again, this is the first reason. %$* 339
uh, illegal immigrants will always win in the competition for jobs. %$* 339
they become preferred workers. %$* 339
it’s not that u.s.citizens will not do these jobs. %$* 339
employers don’t want them. %$* 339
illegal immigrants will always work for the longest hours, the lowest pay or the worst working conditions because no matter how bad conditions are in this country, they’re infinitely better than they are in the countries that they came from. %$* 339
remember, two billion people on this planet today earn less than two dollars a day. %$* 339
two billion – half of all the workers in the world today. %$* 339
that’s what they make. %$* 339
so any condition in this country is way better than what they have had from most of the countries that they’ve come from. %$* 339
so in the competition for jobs they will always be a preferred worker if employers can have them. %$* 339
my view is they should not be allowed to have access to that supply of labor. %$* 339
that is a, that, that – and that’s what our law says, that’s what our law requires. %$* 339
it’s just we don’t enforce our laws. %$* 339
secondly, the, the issue of, of, of the rule of law. %$* 339
illegal immigrants, those who enter without inspection or overstay visas are creating, are committing, uh, criminal misdemeanors. %$* 339
if they, if they over-stay their visa – sorry, if they, if they’ve been deported and then come back in, it’s a felony offense. %$* 339
but we don’t enforce the laws. %$* 339
uh, they get away, so there’s little risk, really in actually following any of those laws. %$* 339
since, since 1986 illegal immigrants who come to the united states, um, uh, uh, are not required to work but they do work. %$* 339
again, the laws that are not being enforced. %$* 339
i’m, i’m real, way behind, i guess, in what i wanted to say. %$* 339
it’s, uh, it’s illegal to use false documents, it’s illegal to, to use somebody else’s identity. %$* 339
it’s illegal to use someone’s else, the social security number. %$* 339
all those things have criminal offense but then nobody applies the laws. %$* 339
how many laws are these people of, uh, are entitled to violate without people becoming cynical about our rule of, our rule of law? %$* 339
uh, uh, driver’s licenses, social services, all the rest of it. %$* 339
um, uh, the last point i wanted to make was about the, about the, the fragileness of our democracy. %$* 339
uh, this exposes the seamier side of it by, by allowing illegal immigration to go on. %$* 339
it gives tacit, uh, uh, approval to their presence in our society and to its human, its human smugglers and abusive employers and unsafe work environments. %$* 339
and all those things are, are, go hand in hand with illegal immigration. %$* 339
the result is to encourage millions to keep coming. %$* 339
um, so that they – and it also-- %$* 339
thank you. %$* 339
much more to say. %$* 339
one. %$* 135
since, since 1986 illegal immigrants who come to the united states, um, uh, uh, are not required to work but they do work. %$* 339
again, the laws that are not being enforced. %$* 339
i’m, i’m real, way behind, i guess, in what i wanted to say. %$* 339
it’s, uh, it’s illegal to use false documents, it’s illegal to, to use somebody else’s identity. %$* 339
it’s illegal to use someone’s else, the social security number. %$* 339
all those things have criminal offense but then nobody applies the laws. %$* 339

and all those things are, are, go hand in hand with illegal immigration. %$* 339
the result is to encourage millions to keep coming. %$* 339
um, so that they – and it also-- %$* 339
speaking for the resolution, vernon briggs. %$* 135
thank you very much. %$* 135
thank you. %$* 339
much more to say. %$* 339
our next speaker against the resolution, enrique morones. %$* 135
thank you. %$* 340
yeah. %$* 340
buenos noches. %$* 340
good evening. %$* 340
shalom. %$* 340
i’m glad to be in, uh, beautiful new york city once again. %$* 340
i wanted to, uh, first of all, thank everybody here and, and for the invitation to share a few moments with you. %$* 340
it’s important that we discuss in a civil manner and, uh, that we talk about the truth about this immigration situation. %$* 340
and i want to find out in the audience, uh, how many native americans are here? %$* 340
how many hundred percent native americans that are indigenous, that could trace their roots to the tribes that were here thousands of years ago? %$* 340
you know, maybe i might be the only one but i’ve gotta admit, only my dad’s side of the family-- %$* 340
eight thousand years. %$* 340
and on my mom’s side of the family i can only go back to the 1600s. %$* 340
and so it’s just to kind of say that even though this is a great country and i love the united states – i’m a u.s.citizen. %$* 340
i was born and raised in san diego – my family came from mexico and it came like most mexican families. %$* 340
it came legally. %$* 340
and it came, like most immigrants come to this country, looking for a better opportunity. %$* 340
and it was driven by economics. %$* 340
my dad’s job had an opportunity in san diego and, and we moved to san diego. %$* 340
and i was born in san diego. %$* 340
it’s very important that we look back on the history of this great country. %$* 340
and i don’t think that we’ve had a lot of welcoming, uh, to immigrants, especially if you look at it from the native american point of view or the people of color point of view. %$* 340
i don’t see very much diversity but we’re all the same race – the human race. %$* 340
and i think it’s important that we treat each other in such a manner. %$* 340
and cesar chavez was mentioned a, a moment ago. %$* 340
they’re one of our biggest supporters, the united farm workers. %$* 340
and i ask you in your prayers to pray for elena chavez who was diagnosed with colon can %$* 340
cancer just a couple of days ago – cesar chavez’s wife. %$* 340
and, uh, they’re, they’re big supporters of our movement and they’ve helped us in, in the efforts that we’re continuing, to have more humane laws. %$* 340
ethel kennedy, uh, robert kennedy’s wife, is really the one that inspired me to come out of the shadows when we started our work as, as border angels back in 1986. %$* 340
and you’ll see some information on some flyers i have in the back for our all-volunteer organization. %$* 340
what we’re best known for is putting water in the desert – putting water in the desert to save people’s lives. %$* 340
but that’s not the only thing we do. %$* 340
we also were instrumental in the massive demonstrations last year which had three and a half million people take to the streets and say, we want humane and comprehensive immigration reform. %$* 340
we don’t want to have any more deaths on the border. %$* 340
we don’t want to have this hate radio and hate television that many of you are familiar with, that’s really sprung up in the last several years. %$* 340
border angels is a non-partisan faith based organization and our mar %$* 340
what our mission statement says, "if i was hungry did you give me to eat, if i was thirsty did you give me to drink? %$* 340
" period. %$* 340
in october of 1994 the united states government decided to build a wall between the united states and mexico. %$* 340
we protested against this wall. %$* 340
what the government said it’s gonna stop the flow of migrants. %$* 340
and i said, why would it stop the flow of migrants? %$* 340
the united states invaded mexico in 1846, took half its territory and there was a treaty that was signed – the treaty of guadalupe de hidalgo – where people were supposed to be able to go back and forth, freely. %$* 340
that was never honored. %$* 340
but there’s nobody alive today that was there when the united states invaded mexico in 1846. what country has not committed sins? %$* 340
every country. %$* 340
every country has racist, every country has people that misinform the public. %$* 340
so let’s stick to the facts. %$* 340

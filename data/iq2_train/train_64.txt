hey, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
so we're going to do a little bit of debating and discussing and defining of millennials during the course of the debate. %$* 13
but there may be folks who don't have direct experience or be aware that they have direct experience with the millennial generation. %$* 13
but you were telling me backstage that you've recently had an interesting encounter. %$* 13
well, yeah. %$* 1
i've been interviewing a couple of millennials, people who entered the work force since 2000, and for an analyst position, a quite highly paid position as a credit analyst and security analyst. %$* 1
and one of these guys i think sort of summed up the reason you might vote for tonight's motion. %$* 1
he's showing me his work product, and the grammar was sloppy. %$* 1
there were spelling mistakes. %$* 1
it was basically just a rehash of a banker's presentation with no indication whatsoever of independent critical thought. %$* 1
and i asked him about his current job, and he immediately started complaining about how they didn't appreciate his work enough. %$* 1
seriously, that was his-- %$* 13
that was his selling point. %$* 13
that was serious. %$* 1
and so that, to me, sort of summarized the rap on millennials that you hear from employers. %$* 1
but, surely, this generation has superstars as well. %$* 13
it does. %$* 1
but, you know, i think an interesting part of the debate is also not just the qualities of millennials themselves but the world in which they have to compete. %$* 1
right. %$* 13
and this is kind of interesting. %$* 1
after i interviewed this group of people, i started to think about outsourcing this analytic function. %$* 1
and we found a company in india that is supplying us a team of seven analysts, all with-- %$* 1
with undergraduate degrees in science and math, all with business degrees, all with cfa, charter financial analyst certification. %$* 1
the entire team is going to cost less than this one guy this i wouldn't even give a job to. %$* 1
and that's-- %$* 1
that's what these people are facing economically. %$* 1
i mean, they're facing real competition in a global world and an environment where there is very little job creation in america. %$* 1
so it's not just about their characteristics, it's also about-- %$* 1
the harsh world out there. %$* 13
the harsh world that they're entering. %$* 1
so is there an argument for-- %$* 13
does the other side have an argument? %$* 13
well, i certainly think they do. %$* 1
the other side of the argument, i'd just sum up by naming four companies: google, facebook, twitter, go pro. %$* 1
i mean, these are all very successful, very large companies that have provided new services and new products never seen before. %$* 1
and each one of them was started by somebody in their 20s. %$* 1
and i don't think we've ever had a generation of 20-somethings who've been able to start large entrepreneurial businesses, watch them grow, innovate as much as they have. %$* 1
this is the most tech savvy and entrepreneurial generation that i've ever seen, i think that america's ever seen. %$* 1
and i think that's the flip side of this motion. %$* 1
well, i thought we might take one second to look out into the audience and just see a show of hands, how many people identify with the millennial generation. %$* 13
wow. %$* 13
i would say that that is maybe slightly more than half. %$* 13
so you all are being judged as well. %$* 13
enjoy tonight and, bob, thank you very much. %$* 13
and let's bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
great. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so as i mentioned, from every now and then, i might be asking for a round of applause for sense of atmospherics, but this one is sincere and authentic. %$* 13
i just want to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for bringing this to us. %$* 13
they are young, they are tolerant, they are entrepreneurial, they are civic minded. %$* 13
no, wait a minute. %$* 13
they're spoiled, they're lazy, they're entitled, they're living in their mother's houses, and they are doomed to disappoint history. %$* 13
i am talking about the generation called the millennials, those born, roughly speaking, in the '80s and the '90s, now america's youngest adults. %$* 13
a caricature, sure, on both sides. %$* 13
but there is something in there, and there's somebody inside there. %$* 13
so let's debate this. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: millennials don't stand a chance, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters here at the kaufman music center in new york, two against two. %$* 13
they will argue for and against this motion: millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in new york votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
millennials don't stand a chance, that is our motion. %$* 13
and let's meet the team arguing for this motion. %$* 13
first, please, let's welcome binta niambi brown. %$* 13
and binta, you did corporate law for quite a while, but you left. %$* 13
you went to the kennedy school at harvard where you worked on market solutions to humanitarian and human rights problems. %$* 13
you're on the boards of a lot of great organizations and one university, at least. %$* 13
but this is what i want to ask you about: a few years ago, you were profiled in real simple magazine, profiled as a mentor to a millennial. %$* 13
and i want to ask you, what does it take to mentor a millennial? %$* 13
it takes patience. %$* 261
because? %$* 13
and compassion. %$* 261
because? %$* 13
because they're millennials. %$* 261
no, i mean-- %$* 261
i'm not going to pick on the millennials. %$* 261
i think they're great. %$* 261
i think i've certainly gained more from mentoring any of them than i have contributed to any of their lives. %$* 261
ladies and gentlemen, binta brown. %$* 13
and binta, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is keith campbell. %$* 261
ladies and gentlemen, keith campbell. %$* 13
keith, you are also arguing for this motion that millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
you're head of psychology at the university of georgia. %$* 13
you're co-author of the book, "the narcissism epidemic, living in the age of entitlement.” you're here to talk tonight in part-- %$* 13
part of your argument is about the narcissistic trends among millennials, this younger generation. %$* 13
but, keith, you know that this phenomenon of slightly older generations wringing their hands about slightly younger generations is as old as the hills, right? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 262
i mean, people wrung their hands about me. %$* 262
some still do. %$* 262
i think the thing to keep in mind, there's a lot of positive you see in millennials; tolerance for other people being a big one. %$* 262
but there are some down sides i'm going to talk about. %$* 262
with an argument. %$* 13
yes. %$* 262
you've come to the right place. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, w.keith campbell. %$* 13
our motion is "millennials do not stand a chance.” and two panelists will be arguing against this motion. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome david burstein. %$* 13
david, you are 25.you are, congratulations, the youngest debater we've ever had on this stage. %$* 13
you are founder of generation 18.it's a nonpartisan organization to get-out-the-vote among young people. %$* 13
you wrote the book, "fast future: how the millennial generation is shaping our world.” you made your first documentary back in 2008.it was called "18.” you had interviews with jeb bush, samantha power, john kerry. %$* 13
how old were you when you started that project? %$* 13
i was 16. %$* 263
16 years old. %$* 13
and did you have any idea at the time that you had no idea what you were doing? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 263
i didn't really think about that fact. %$* 263
it might have been good to think about in retrospect, but i think it's kind of typical of this generation that we just go out and do right away. %$* 263
thank you, david burstein. %$* 13
and, david, your partner is? %$* 13
jessica grose. %$* 263
jennifer grose, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
uh, jessica. %$* 13
jessica. %$* 13
i just said jennifer. %$* 13
let me do that again. %$* 13
all millennials are named either jessica or jennifer. %$* 264
it's okay. %$* 264
we can fix it up on the radio so that millions of people will never know the awful error i just made if i-- %$* 13
if i just say, "jessica grose, ladies and gentlemen." jessica grose, you are a self-described ancient millennial. %$* 13
you're a contributor to slate and bloomberg business week. %$* 13
you write a lot about culture and creativity for fast companies, co-create. %$* 13
you've been a senior editor at slate and jezebel. %$* 13
in 2012, you published your first novel, "sad desk salad.” so you've done a lot, and you are doing a lot. %$* 13
so what is the top reason you took time out from all of that to defend millennials on this stage tonight? %$* 13
well, i mean, i couldn't just sit home and listen to my generation be maligned by people who don't understand us. %$* 264
so, you know, i had to come defend our honor. %$* 264
all right. %$* 13
you know that you are being judged like they are as well. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jessica grose. %$* 13
and these are our debaters. %$* 13
now, this is a contest. %$* 13
there will be judgment. %$* 13
the debate will, at the end, have a winner and a loser, and that will be determined by a vote of our live audience here in new york city. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again at the conclusion. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
let's go to the preliminary vote. %$* 13
go to the keypad at your seats. %$* 13
again, look at the motion:"millennials don't stand a chance.” if you agree with this, if you agree that they don't stand a chance, that means you're for the motion and we want you to push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with it, if you think they do stand a chance or better, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and remember how you voted this time. %$* 13
we'll-- %$* 13
at the very end of the debating we'll have you vote a second time, and we got about a 90-second turnaround, and that's how we declare our winner. %$* 13
okay, we're going to lock it out, and we're going to get started. %$* 13
on to round one, our motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” opening statements from the face-- %$* 13
first opening statement from the first debater. %$* 13
it will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
it will be seven minutes long. %$* 13
and let's welcome to the lectern w.keith campbell. %$* 13
he is professor of psychology at the university of georgia, coauthor of several books, including "the narcissism epidemic" and "the handbook of narcissism" and "narcissistic personality disorder.” ladies and gentlemen, please welcome w. keith campbell. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 262
it's always nice when people mention "narcissism" and then they start laughing. %$* 262
i never know why, but it's always like a bad ex-relationship or something. %$* 262
what i'm here to argue for is that "millennials don't stand a chance.” what i'm not here to do is malign millennials or bash millennials. %$* 262
that's fun. %$* 262
i just don't want to do it. %$* 262
i don't want them to fail. %$* 262
i don't want my kids to fail either who are going to be the next generation. %$* 262
but, that said, i think there's a lot of problems. %$* 262
and to sum it up easily as i can i'd say there is a major disconnect or major gap between how young people were raised in the '80s and '90s, they're born in-- %$* 262
people born in the '80s and '90s, the millennials, and the world they're facing today. %$* 262
think about it this way, they were raised with a very inflated optimistic view of themselves and the world. %$* 262
and they're-- %$* 262
we've given them a really terrible place to get a start. %$* 262
let me just expand on this a little bit. %$* 262
if you think about the millennial self, these are kids that started-- %$* 262
that were born in the '80s, they started school right when the self-esteem movement hit. %$* 262
this was brought to us by the good people in california in 1982, started going through schools-- %$* 262
the idea was if we can give kids self-esteem they'll do better in life. %$* 262
and the way to give kids self-esteem is not to have them succeed at optimal challenges or have strong relationships, which actually works, it was to tell them they're special and unique and give them lots of awards and trophies as people sort of lament. %$* 262
so we set people off that way. %$* 262
and we do have a generation with very high self-esteem, especially college students. %$* 262
self-esteem is near the top of the scales we measure. %$* 262
we also see some of the darker side of self-esteem with that. %$* 262
we do see increasing narcissism. %$* 262
it wasn't like it was flat with gen x and then jumped up, but it just keeps going up and up. %$* 262
we see increasing uniqueness. %$* 262
we see this with the names we've given kids, and this is the millennials, but we're still doing this. %$* 262
i mean, now with our children born today we don't even give them names. %$* 262
if we're celebrities we name them directions on a compass so our-- %$* 262
name them after fruit-- %$* 262
so these kids are given a sense of specialness, they think they're better than others. %$* 262
we've raised expectations in young people dramatically, where they have high expectations about professional careers, they have high expectations about going to graduate school, and, again, it's great to raise expectations if you can provide a reality for that. %$* 262
and finally there's been this big shift in values. %$* 262
there's been a switch from what we call "intrinsic values," which the baby boomers tended to have, to much more extrinsic values. %$* 262
to give you an example of the biggest change would be something like in the baby boom people said, "i want a meaningful philosophy of life.” people don't say that anymore. %$* 262
people aren't looking for their true self. %$* 262
what they're looking for now is a job to make lots of money. %$* 262
again, that's fine, it just doesn't fit with our world. %$* 262
so if you take that inflated psychology the millennials were raised with and you look at reality right now, we have very high youth unemployment, we're talking about 12-- %$* 262
a little over 12 percent for people in the young 20s with very liberal numbers of unemployment. %$* 262
we have a trillion dollars in student loan debt. %$* 262
and student loan debt is horrible. %$* 262
i mean, this isn't like, "gee, i bought a mcmansion .oh, i can't afford it. %$* 262
i can live in it for three years and send the keys back."and this is like "i can't get rid of this stuff because the government says, 'you can't get rid of it.'" you have massive levels of competition for jobs. %$* 262
you have massive levels of competition for those elite education tracks. %$* 262
i mean, people are hiring people to write college essays now, it's-- %$* 262
i mean, like paying to make 30 grand to get into college. %$* 262
the millennials are having to put off marriage. %$* 262
the average marriage age now for women is 27, 29 for men. %$* 262
you have over a third of young people 18 to 30-- %$* 262
living back at home with their parents. %$* 262
not necessarily in a basement. %$* 262
lots of homes don't have basements, but maybe over the garage. %$* 262
maybe someplace else. %$* 262
and yet-- %$* 262
i mean, even now, sociologists talk about this period of emerging adulthood-- %$* 262
age 20 to 24-- %$* 262
which is something we didn't talk about 20 years ago. %$* 262
these people are in a cocoon and they're going to butterfly out as adults. %$* 262
and they might. %$* 262
we have decrease in civic engagements. %$* 262
most measures we look at-- %$* 262
millennials volunteer more than any generation we've studied. %$* 262
so, that number has gone up. %$* 262
they voted a lot for obama's first term. %$* 262
but other than that, civic engagement has dropped. %$* 262
and generally, the sense of trust we have in the country for each other and for our major institutions-- %$* 262
our journalists, our government, our religion-- %$* 262
is at the lowest point we've ever measured. %$* 262
i mean, the country in terms of just our basic civil institutions is collapsing. %$* 262
bottom line, and people grown up, raised by us-- %$* 262
they don't raise themselves. %$* 262
they're raised to have a very positive view and a very optimistic view. %$* 262
and they're put in a reality that is incredibly challenging, incredibly negative. %$* 262
some are making it. %$* 262
some are doing great stuff in entrepreneurship. %$* 262
they're creating their own jobs. %$* 262
other people are part of what i think of as the great fantasy migration. %$* 262
they're dressed up as wookies or stormtoopers, or they're living in their mom's basement, playing world of warcraft. %$* 262
and you get a lot of ego needs met that way and have a lot of good relationships. %$* 262
but that aside, it's very tough. %$* 262
and i apologize for being so negative on such a nice evening. %$* 262
thank you. %$* 262
thank you. %$* 13
w.keith campbell. %$* 13
our motion is, millenials do not stand a chance. %$* 13
and here to argue against this motion is jessica grose. %$* 13
she writes for fast company's co.create and is a frequent contributor to slate and bloomberg businessweek. %$* 13
and also author of the novel "sad desk salad.” ladies and gentlemen, jessica grose. %$* 13
so, like john said, i call myself an "ancient millennial.” i was born in 1982, which is the first year in a lot of definitions of millennial. %$* 264
i have a baby, and a husband, and a mortgage, and all those things that keith worries millennials will never have. %$* 264
we are the most racially diverse. %$* 264
we are the most educated generation of adults today. %$* 264
we've got the lowest amount of debt in 15 years. %$* 264
and that, you know, in part because we've seen what's happened to the world and we have decided to pull back on buying frivolous things. %$* 264
we have healthy relationships with our parents, reported highest levels of healthiness among all adults today. %$* 264
and we have a deep entrepreneurial spirit, as the mentioned. %$* 264
so, why do our detractors say that we're doomed? %$* 264
they say we're immature, immoral narcissists who want to live in our parent's basement. %$* 264
it's always the basement. %$* 264
or maybe the attic. %$* 264
so, these stereotypes are based on false media narratives. %$* 264
and i am urging you to vote against the proposition because i'm going to dispel those falsehoods. %$* 264
and my partner, david, he's going to tell you about some of the under reported truths about millennials. %$* 264
so, let's start with that first myth, that basement myth. %$* 264
so, it's true that a greater percentage of millennials live at home than previous generations. %$* 264
but the degree to which that's true has been completely exaggerated. %$* 264
keith said a third. %$* 264
that's not the numbers i've read. %$* 264
the numbers from pew are that 15 percent of millennials live at home, compared to 12 percent of boomers and 13 percent of genx. so, i don't know where they're getting that. %$* 264
and the second part of the myth is that it's necessarily a bad thing. %$* 264
half of the millennials who live at home are in college. %$* 264
and so, i think it's better for them to be living with their parents while they get an education than to be wasting money they don't have on dorms and apartments. %$* 264
so, the second part of the myth is that the people who aren't in college are just sponging and they're playing video games all day. %$* 264
so, i have two examples here. %$* 264
one is lena dunham, because you cannot have a debate about millennials without mentioning lena dunham. %$* 264
she is the creator of hbo's "girls.” if you don't know who she is. %$* 264
she lived at home after graduating from college to make her first feature film, which went to south by southwest and led directly to her being the creator, star, and writer of her own hbo show, which is the most zeitgeist-y show in generations. %$* 264
so, maybe you think, "dunham is privileged. %$* 264
she's not a good example.” so, how about sophia amoruso? %$* 264
she was making $13 an hour. %$* 264
she was a community college dropout when she was living at-- %$* 264
with a family member in their cottage. %$* 264
she started an online business, selling vintage clothing on ebay. %$* 264
that online business has turned into a multi-million dollar organization called "nasty gal clothing.” she employs 300 people. %$* 264
so, i don't think she would have been able to do that if she had to pay rent on some bad apartment. %$* 264
really having that support allowed her to launch herself into the world. %$* 264
so, the second myth is that we're immature. %$* 264
and some of this immaturity is said because we're not buying cars and we're not buying homes like the people in generations before us did. %$* 264
and that's not because we don't have the maturity. %$* 264
it's because we prefer to live sustainably, not just financially sustainably, but environmentally sustainably. %$* 264
we want to live in close communities. %$* 264
we use public transportation. %$* 264
and i think that that's all to the good. %$* 264
with the age of the mcmansion and the suv, the ginormous suv, that's over, and good riddens to that. %$* 264
so the third myth is that we're immoral, and, as keith mentioned, we're less religious. %$* 264
but if you actually ask millennials why they've left the church or temple that they were raised in, a full third of them say that it's because of their church's values about the lgbt community. %$* 264
so i think that actually shows a huge amount of moral backbone to be able to question what you were raised in and to be able to say that you want to be on the right side of history. %$* 264
so the fourth myth, and it's the most pervasive myth, is that we are narcissists. %$* 264
and what galls me is that it's always the boomers saying this. %$* 264
and they were the original narcissists. %$* 264
i mean, i think they forget that tom wolfe called them "the me generation" in 1976. but-- %$* 264
so keith has told you that we have this inflated, overoptimistic sense of the world. %$* 264
but that's not my impression at all. %$* 264
if you went back to 2000, david brooks wrote an article in the atlantic called "the organization kit.” it might have been 2001.i was either a freshman or sophomore in college. %$* 264
and that was a much more accurate picture of how we were raised. %$* 264
we were raised to know that we are competing in a global world. %$* 264
remember, everybody had to learn japanese in the '80s and '90s, because they wanted us to-- %$* 264
our parents wanted us to compete the same way that kids are learning mandarin today. %$* 264
and he says, you know, we are more narcissistic because we agree with statements like, "i will be a success.” you know, those are just statements. %$* 264
you know, it's just words. %$* 264
and i think actions speak so much stronger than that. %$* 264
as has been said, we volunteer more than any generation. %$* 264
73 percent of millennials volunteered for a nonprofit in 2012.and the percentage of college freshman believing that it's essential or for very important to help people in need is the highest level it's been at in 40 years. %$* 264
there are the lowest levels of drug use, teen pregnancy and youth crime. %$* 264
that speaks louder than any multiple choice test to me. %$* 264
so i'm not going to stand here and say we weren't dealt a bad hand. %$* 264
like it's been said, we graduated into a recession. %$* 264
the jobs are scarce, and that there are systemic problems in america with poverty and income inequality that plagues all generations, not just us. %$* 264
but i think that millennials are uniquely qualified to solve these problems because we're committed to social justice, we're committed to sustainability, and we have this entrepreneurial spirit. %$* 264
so i really urge you to vote against the proposition because we are so far from doomed. %$* 264
we're just getting started. %$* 264
thank you, jessica grose. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: millennials do not stand a chance. %$* 13
you've heard the first two opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating for the motion that the millennials don't stand a chance, binta niambi brown. %$* 13
she is a lawyer, a startup adviser, a human rights advocate. %$* 13
she has been recognized as one of fortune magazine's "40 under 40 business leaders" and as a young global leader by the world economic forum. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, binta niambi brown. %$* 13
good evening, everybody. %$* 261
so i'm a lover, i'm not a fighter. %$* 261
i'm not here to fight, i'm not here to bash, i'm not here to talk about all of the reasons why millennials are horrible people and are going to fail of their own doing because i don't believe that. %$* 261
i mentor millennials, and i educate them. %$* 261
and i am a firm believer in their capacity. %$* 261
with that said, the picture is not nearly as rosy as it's been painted by my esteemed opponent, jessica. %$* 261
so a couple of things that i'd like to unpack. %$* 261
first, the notion that millennials are the most educated generation in the history of humanity, ever. %$* 261
we can look at that from a quantitative perspective, and we can also look at that from a qualitative perspective. %$* 261
let's talk about it first quantitatively. %$* 261
my generation, generation x, the forgotten generation. %$* 261
everybody likes to skip over us. %$* 261
we don't have complexes. %$* 261
we invent companies like google, actually. %$* 261
it was x that invented google, not y.correction from earlier tonight. %$* 261
so my generation, at this point, depending on the study you look at, we range in education from 30 to 45 percent having completed the equivalent of a four-year college degree. %$* 261
if you look at the boomer generation, between the ages of 55 to 64-- %$* 261
and again, i'm reminding you of the quantitative versus the qualitative assessment. %$* 261
if you look at the boomer generation, the boomer generation is now around 32 percent. %$* 261
the very wonderful cohort that comes up behind me, they are currently at or estimated to be around 33 percent. %$* 261
so this notion that they have more education at this point in time than anybody else is actually not true from a quantitative perspective. %$* 261
it's also not true qualitatively. %$* 261
and what do i mean by that? %$* 261
the quality of education in the united states as we all know and have been reading about over and over and over again has been declining precipitously over the course of the last several decades, in particular as concerns science and mathematics. %$* 261
that people are taking tests, that they are taking aps, that they are going to college does not mean that they are learning any better, particularly in an environment where our government has insisted on teachers teaching to the test instead of developing deep critical analytical thinking skills that are absolutely and unequivocally necessary in our workplace. %$* 261
so qualitatively is not quite there either. %$* 261
let's also discuss this notion of what a millennial is. %$* 261
i think far too often, when we're having conversations about when a millennial is and what a millennial isn't, we do talk about lena dunham, and we talk about mark zuckerberg. %$* 261
but i think that they are far and away the exceptions for the millennial population. %$* 261
as noted, the millennial group is the most diverse in the history of humanity. %$* 261
43 percent are nonwhite. %$* 261
of that 43 percent who are nonwhite, 35 percent of them are black and hispanic. %$* 261
the black and hispanic millennials are in primarily underperforming schools, they are mostly unemployed, they are not receiving college degrees at the same rate. %$* 261
and the situation for them is particularly bleak and really, really bad. %$* 261
i'm going to keep going with this theme a little bit further because we can't just talk about the exceptions. %$* 261
we have to talk about the whole. %$* 261
so when we say on our side that millennials don't stand a chance, we're not talking about jess, we're not talking about david, we're not talking about a couple of my millennial mentees who are here tonight, we're not talking about the millennial entrepreneur whom i have given some advice to. %$* 261
we're talking about all of the rest of them. %$* 261
we can't focus on just 1 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent of the stars. %$* 261
so even with that, 66 percent of millennials are not earning college degrees, right? %$* 261
that sounds like it's a high number, and it's not when you think about the number of people who have actually earned their college degrees. %$* 261
but in an economy that is a knowledge-based economy, where increasingly we need people with these computer science and engineering degrees, it's pretty bad, right? %$* 261
and it's bad because, as was alluded to earlier tonight, we're entering into the age of artificial intelligence. %$* 261
we're entering into the age of machine learning. %$* 261
the kinds of jobs that we've prepared millennials to take, right, are not going to exist. %$* 261
and so then what do they do? %$* 261
they're going to end up in jobs and careers unless there is a dramatic intervention, which i will argue we need to have a dramatic intervention, then will end up in the kind of jobs and the kinds of careers where they are overeducated and underpaid. %$* 261
and that's not particularly good, particularly for a generation, as keith has already said, which has $1.1 trillion worth of student debt, which, by the way, jessica, is the reason many analysts are saying millennials are staying home. %$* 261
so i'm sure it's very nice to have anecdotal evidence suggesting that millennials are staying because they like their parents. %$* 261
i too like my parents. %$* 261
i'm extraordinarily close with my parents. %$* 261
i wish they could have made it tonight. %$* 261
i actually have a lot of millennial qualities. %$* 261
that's not a bad thing. %$* 261
but i think that financial independence for most of us and for most adults means that we want to move out of the house at a certain point. %$* 261
and that's important for another reason, not because we want people to over-consume, but because the traditional indicators for economic growth and what that relies upon is a form of consumption that relies on housing strikes that relies on housing formation, that relies on purchases of furniture and purchases of appliances and other things millennials are currently not able to afford in part because those who are college educated, who are not undereducated, right, so the undereducated millennials are in the absolute worst position. %$* 261
those who are college educated, to the extent that they weren't qualified to get the high-tech jobs, which most of them are not qualified for, as i've already suggested, they're in jobs which don't actually require a college degree. %$* 261
and so they're not earning enough money. %$* 261
and this is isn't, by the way, any of their fault. %$* 261
i have about 45 seconds left, so i'm going to hit on two more important points. %$* 261
none of this is the fault of the millennial generation. %$* 261
all of this is the fault of the kinds of policies, baby boomers, the greatest generation, and even a few people who are in the generation x in washington right now have put into place. %$* 261
it's the absence of a good jobs policy. %$* 261
it's the inability for us to work on entitlement reform and shifting all of that burden to millennials. %$* 261
and so it's no wonder that this generation is completely stressed out. %$* 261
and if i had more time, i would begin to tell you about the very difficult numbers of 44 percent of college students evidencing or suggesting that they have some level of depression. %$* 261
things are not as good as they seem. %$* 261
thank you very much. %$* 261
thank you, binta niambi brown. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "millennials don't stand a chance.” and here, our final debater to argue against this motion, "millennials don't stand a chance," david burstein. %$* 13
he is the author of "fast future: how the millennial generation is shaping our world.” he is founder of the voter engagement group, generation 18. ladies and gentlemen, david burstein. %$* 13
thanks, john, and thanks to all of you for being here tonight. %$* 263
you've heard obviously a lot of things already about millennials. %$* 263
and, as jessica mentioned, i'm going to hit on a couple things that are true about millennials that i think are important to consider in this context. %$* 263
i am a millennial, as was stated earlier. %$* 263
and i have been spending the past several years really trying to understand what this generation is and what this generation means and particularly thinking about how it relates to the context of the world that we're living in. %$* 263
and i want to just highlight that. %$* 263
i'll come back to that later, thinking about the context of this world and what that means. %$* 263
i got my start, as was mentioned earlier, in political engagement, thinking about young people in political engagement. %$* 263
and the trend we have seen in youth political participation over the past several election cycles is really remarkable. %$* 263
and this is in the face of a generation who has seen arguably the most toxic political climate that we've seen in many, many years, who has turned out in record numbers to vote in recent elections, who have actually had an incredible role in pushing issues like gay marriage to be where they are at today. %$* 263
this is the generation who has the largest support of that issue. %$* 263
and it's a generation who have actually worked on campaigns. %$* 263
they've gone to volunteer. %$* 263
they've gotten deeply engaged in what it means to be a candidate for office. %$* 263
in fact, just this sunday i was in pennsylvania for a person in this generation who was actually running for office. %$* 263
so i think there's a lot to consider there about the role of this generation in politics and how that contributes to that. %$* 263
and when keith talks about civic engagement and the lack of civic engagement in this generation and says that voter participation volunteerism are up, i think that there are other measures of at least political engagement-- %$* 263
there aren't very other many measures you can measure when you look at that. %$* 263
so it's really a deeply engaged generation. %$* 263
it's also the first generation that truly is a global generation, that understands the role of their relationship to the rest of the world. %$* 263
and as you think about, you know, what robert was mentioning earlier about jobs going to india and other places, this is a generation that gets that. %$* 263
for previous generations, people have actually had the choice about whether or not they wanted to recognize that there was another part of the world out there. %$* 263
this is the first generation who has no choice but to realize that and deeply understands that. %$* 263
in fact, 93 percent of people in this generation say that they at some point in their life expect to live or work globally. %$* 263
so it's really a generation that's in tune with the reality of the world that we're living in. %$* 263
you also look at this generation in terms of social activism, which is also something i've spent a lot of time thinking about. %$* 263
and it's true that volunteerism is up, but one of the most remarkable things that's happened over the past several years is you've seen record numbers of people in this generation starting their own businesses, starting their own organizations, and caring about issues as diverse as gang violence on their own street or international development in africa. %$* 263
and you see this incredible range of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds who are participating in trying to make the world a better place. %$* 263
in fact, an overwhelming majority of people in this generation actually say they would take a job that pays them less money if they could have more impact in that work. %$* 263
and you see record numbers of applications for programs like teacher america, the peace corps, a lot of which has followed ever since 9/11, which in a lot of ways was an important civic moment for this generation, which really allowed people to see that there was something that as individuals we can do. %$* 263
for us, if you think about the context for the past several years of what this generation has gone through, growing up in an age where we lived under the specter of two wars, where we saw every one of our biggest institutions fail, banks, educational systems, our political system, it is incredible to know that this is a really resilient generation. %$* 263
in the face of the economic crisis, people in generation actually became more optimistic about their own economic future. %$* 263
and those numbers are still true today. %$* 263
in fact, eight in 10 people in this generation, according to a pew study that just came out a couple weeks ago, say that they have enough money now to live the life that they want to life or-- %$* 263
and that they will in the future. %$* 263
and you also look at the fact that 75 percent of the people in this generation have given to-- %$* 263
have given to charity over the past several years. %$* 263
and 49 percent say that america's best days are ahead of us. %$* 263
all of these numbers, by incidentally, have tracked over the past several years, as people have been following millennials. %$* 263
and they're also relatively on par or higher with people in this generation than they were in their counterparts' years before. %$* 263
but the final thing that i wanted to talk about is this role of entrepreneurship. %$* 263
binta sort of made the point about the fact that there are only a handful of people who are doing this. %$* 263
but it's important to note, first of all, that there are the largest number of self-made millionaires and billionaires in this-- %$* 263
under the age of 35-- %$* 263
that exist in this generation that have ever existed. %$* 263
and if you were talking about whether or not millennials don't stand a chance, i think that's an important consideration, to look at the amount of wealth creation-- %$* 263
not just what that means in the raw numbers, but what that means in terms of the kinds of things that this generation is capable of. %$* 263
you know, as john pointed out, when i was being introduced, this is a generation that doesn't think about "should i do this? %$* 263
should i not do this? %$* 263
" but it's a generation that actually jumps into action. %$* 263
in the face of the economic crisis, well - - there were a number of suicides related to economic challenges for people of older generations. %$* 263
there was not a single such one for people in this generation. %$* 263
when you look at these indicators of how that economic crisis fared, people in this generation became incredibly resilient in looking at-- %$* 263
looking at the future and continue to do that today. %$* 263
in fact, an overwhelming majority of people in this generation say that someday they might like to start their own company. %$* 263
whether or not people actually do that is another question, but the idea that people are thinking in that kind of way gives us a kind of strong-headedness and resilience that i think will be very positive going into the future. %$* 263
the jobs of this economy, in this environment-- %$* 263
are different. %$* 263
but this is a generation that has grown up in the future, in this new world, who's absolutely ready to fight and compete for that kind of work. %$* 263
and it's a generation that really has accomplished in its short lifetime an incredible amount. %$* 263
so, i'm going to-- %$* 263
i'm going to stop now. %$* 263
i'm looking forward to discussing with you guys a little more. %$* 263
thank you. %$* 13
david burstein. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate? %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again immediately after the debate. %$* 13
and remember, it is the team that moves the numbers the most, in percentage point terms, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
i want to let you know that tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website-- %$* 13
iq2us.org-- %$* 13
and also on fora.tv.if you are watching the live stream, we'd like to hear from you too. %$* 13
send us questions via twitter or facebook with the hashtag millennial so that we spot it. %$* 13
and be sure to let us know what city and state you're from, and also your first name. %$* 13
so, now on to round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
round 2 is where the debaters address one another in turn, and also take questions from me, and from you in the live audience. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
w. keith campell and binta brown-- %$* 13
we heard them say basically that millennials have been set up to fail by being sent into a challenging world without really having any of the antibodies to challenge. %$* 13
they say that they have not been as well educated as they think they are, that they are postponing adulthood, that they are narcissistic like no generation has ever been. %$* 13
they can see that there are success stories, but they say those are the exception and that things are particularly bleak for minorities. %$* 13
bottom line? %$* 13
they're not saying nasty things about their opponents. %$* 13
they're saying none of this is their fault, that they've been cheated by the generations ahead of them who left them a terrible deal. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
keith-- %$* 13
jessica grose and david burstein-- %$* 13
they're saying that basically millennials are the victims of a lot of ridiculous myths in the media. %$* 13
yes, perhaps, they live in their basement. %$* 13
it's not because they're freeloading, it's because they are frugal, that they are conserving their resources in a difficult time, that they know what they're doing. %$* 13
they say, in response to the notion that they're narcissistic, that no generation has been as civically involved as this one, that this generation has healthy relationships and entrepreneurial spirit, that it's optimistic, resilient. %$* 13
and therefore, that it holds in its hands-- %$* 13
and its personalities-- %$* 13
the solutions to the very challenges that they are facing. %$* 13
what i want to do is put a question to the side that is arguing that millennials don't stand a chance, and tell you that what i hear from your opponents is an explosion of optimism. %$* 13
they've heard everything you said. %$* 13
to a great degree, concede that times are tough. %$* 13
but, boy, do they believe in themselves, and purely on optimism, they think they're going to get through. %$* 13
and i want to put to either of you a response to that, either binta or keith. %$* 13
binta brown. %$* 13
so i think optimism is awesome. %$* 261

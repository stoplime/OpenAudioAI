you're not quite saying it, but you're suggesting, paul, that there's not a whole lot of point in reducing your calories and exercising more if your goal is to lose weight. %$* 13
and that just flies in the face of everything that even you stand for in your work, pamela. %$* 13
so take that on. %$* 13
i will be more than happy to take that on. %$* 415
apparently paul is not aware of the national weight control registry. %$* 415
this is an ongoing study, almost 20 years old, which has been sponsored by the university of colorado as well as brown university, my colleagues, dr. %$* 415
james hill and rena wing. %$* 415
the cohort right now is over 10,000 people, including people who have bariatric surgery as well. %$* 415
and these people are known as the successful losers. %$* 415
and actually, paul, you actually are too, because of your own weight loss as you noted in your book. %$* 415
you qualify because you had to have dropped at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least a year. %$* 415
and the grand majority of these people have kept off approximately 60 pounds for almost six years or longer. %$* 415
and this is on the average in a very large cohort. %$* 415
so are these mutants? %$* 415
freaks? %$* 415
what are they? %$* 415
these people have determined that they will keep this weight off by utilizing very simple things. %$* 415
and this has been published in extensive literature. %$* 415
one of the most interesting things we found was that the number one predictor for being able to keep weight off and do this well is to have a healthy breakfast every morning. %$* 415
they are physically active. %$* 415
are they part of the olympic camp? %$* 415
no. %$* 415
they basically get out. %$* 415
and the number one favorite thing to do is walk. %$* 415
and in most of the government interventions, all we're asking people to do is not drop weight so much. %$* 415
that's not where we're going. %$* 415
losing weight, i'm a physician. %$* 415
people lose weight and do really stupid things to lose weight. %$* 415
that's not where we're going. %$* 415
so you're talking-- %$* 13
we're going to health. %$* 415
you're talking-- %$* 13
we're going to health, and we're going to fitness. %$* 415
pamela. %$* 13
and that's what we saw in this study. %$* 415
so you're emphasizing information, encouragement and education. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 415
i want to ask john stossel, what's wrong with the government through schools emphasizing education information and encouragement? %$* 13
because pamela said that's all voluntary and talked about public-private partnerships being voluntary. %$* 288
but government isn't voluntary. %$* 288
it said we have a voluntary tax system. %$* 288
but try not paying your taxes and see if it's voluntary. %$* 288
men with guns will come and make you pay for the dumb programs that they keep creating that don't work and that paul says make people miserable. %$* 288
and keep growing. %$* 288
but john, what would be the harm of-- %$* 13
of spending money in a school to put this on the curriculum and keep it on the curriculum? %$* 13
because the schools can barely teach reading, writing and arithmetic. %$* 288
david satcher. %$* 13
well, i think a couple of things. %$* 414
the goal of these programs is to help children develop lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition. %$* 414
we also know, by the way, that children who develop good eating habits and regular physical activity do better academically. %$* 414
they perform better on standardized exams in math and reading. %$* 414
they are more disciplined in school. %$* 414
so the benefits of healthy lifestyles go far beyond losing weight. %$* 414
now, paul quoted the statistics about weight loss versus decrease in diabetes. %$* 414
the goal is to decrease fat. %$* 414
and sometimes you can decrease fat and increase muscle and not lose weight. %$* 414
but you still reduce the risk of diabetes. %$* 414
i think you know that as a runner. %$* 414
so let them learn that from pamela's tv show and from richard simmons. %$* 288
we don't need government. %$* 288
excuse-- %$* 414
here's the problem. %$* 415
pamela peeke. %$* 13
yeah, that's nice for people who do have cable tv.unfortunately, many people don't have discovery channel. %$* 415
so for those poor people out there who have no access, what are you going to do? %$* 415
you just assume they're going to catch it on the tube. %$* 415
oh, no. %$* 415
you're not supposed to be watching tv because if you watch tv too long, you get this big. %$* 415
so, i mean, you're going round and round. %$* 415
why not just sit there? %$* 415
why not do what alice waters did in berkeley, the martin luther king middle school? %$* 415
she built a garden. %$* 415
she had the kids grow stuff. %$* 415
all right. %$* 13
paul campos. %$* 13
kids who grow and eat it. %$* 415
paul campos. %$* 13
again, just-- %$* 13
well, i just-- %$* 416
i love alice waters' cooking, i'll tell you. %$* 416
i think it's awesome. %$* 416
but i think her social policy is rather questionable because she wants everybody to be like they're an upper class white woman in berkeley. %$* 416
and that's just not going to happen, right, for all kinds of reasons. %$* 416
now, what i'm going to emphasize here is that the government's theory seems to be something along the lines of, people are fat because they have not been given the information that it is more desirable in this culture to be thin rather than to be fat. %$* 416
i don't think that's correct. %$* 416
i think this information is-- %$* 416
is not exactly a state secret. %$* 416
it's been widely disseminated. %$* 416
well, let's be clear, though. %$* 414
david satcher. %$* 13
it's not the information. %$* 414
it's the opportunity to act on it. %$* 414
i think what pamela described in terms of in the inner cities of the country—you don't have sidewalks, you don't have safe places to be physically active, you don't have access to grocery stores, so what you're talking about is the opportunity-- %$* 414
that's absolutely right. %$* 415
to leave-- %$* 414
tell me the government's role in creating those opportunities. %$* 13
are you literally talking about building sidewalks, %$* 13
yeah, in some-- %$* 414
the government-- %$* 13
look at what louisville did. %$* 414
it changed the zoning laws so that within so much area you had to have grocery stores and you had to have parks and playgrounds, so the government can, in fact, produce the opportunities for people to have access. %$* 414
did people lose weight in louisville when that happened? %$* 13
well, i think it's too soon to say they lost weight but they clearly increased healthy lifestyle, but, believe me, the fixation on weight is not ours. %$* 414
oh, really? %$* 416
the fixation here is on healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
what was your report called, dr. %$* 416
satcher, your 2001 report? %$* 416
was it a report on healthy lifestyles? %$* 416
no, the first ever surgeon general's report was on smoking and health and it was on cancer, but that wasn't the focus. %$* 414
the focus was on getting people to stop smoking. %$* 414
absolutely. %$* 415
so are you in favor of getting people to stop eating? %$* 416
getting people to stop-- %$* 414
getting people to eat-- %$* 414
to engage in healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
well, i'm all for engaging in healthy lifestyles, but i'd like to point out that-- %$* 416
that's the role of government. %$* 414
one of the most interesting things about this debate is that if you had a time capsule, everything that's being said by the advocates of the government's position here was said almost literally word for word in the 1950s. %$* 416
remember-- %$* 416
some of you may remember-- %$* 416
president john kennedy-- %$* 416
i don't remember it actually, but i've read about it-- %$* 416
initiative for the president's council on physical fitness, right? %$* 416
i remember that. %$* 288
john remembers it, right? %$* 416
i remember that, you had to throw a softball 100 yards and do pushups-- %$* 13
that's right, all that kind of thing, you know, that we're all and, you know, for being healthy in that way. %$* 416
john kennedy was actually a wreck physically but they hid that quite successfully at the time because-- %$* 416
but anyways, that's another story. %$* 416
the thing is, it's really striking, if you looked at the literature, the government officials were saying in the 1950s the same thing they're saying today, they're saying, "americans are getting horribly fat, and it's going to cause this huge health crisis, and if we don't do something about it, the russians are going to just come in and push us over and takeover-- %$* 416
" "-- %$* 416
and it's, you know, the terrorists within," and all that stuff, and nothing that was ever predicted took place. %$* 416
but this is one area i have found in terms of government policy and social hysteria and moral panic where data simply doesn't move anything because people have such a fixation with the desirability of weight loss that you can talk all you want about how we ought to have healthier lifestyles, but what people really want to do is make people thin. %$* 416
all right. %$* 13
no, we don't want to make people thin. %$* 415
pamela for just one second. %$* 13
we don't want to make people thin. %$* 415
and i don't know where this came from. %$* 415
apparently there's a fantasy land going on over there. %$* 415
"thin" is a four-letter word, okay? %$* 415
i don't know what it means. %$* 415
all we care about is healthy and fit. %$* 415
come on. %$* 415
let's get real here for a minute. %$* 415
fifty years ago, if you were 10 or 15 pounds overweight it was a crisis, you know, you couldn't get out of your size four, whatever. %$* 415
today i'm a physician and i don't make fun of this stuff. %$* 415
i'm a compassionate physician because i have people sitting in front of me and they're in pain. %$* 415
and do you know what? %$* 415
they don't have 15 to 20 pounds to drop. %$* 415
they have 100 and 150.it's changed. %$* 415
it's changed from 1950. and i'll tell you what, they'll never get within spitting distance of an ideal body weight, so you know what i do today? %$* 415
i've changed the game. %$* 415
i think it's head south, just start moving down, five percent, 10 percent, pick up healthy lifestyles, small steps here. %$* 415
that's all you need to do. %$* 415
but, pamela, what does that have to do-- %$* 13
what does that have to do with the government's being-- %$* 13
it has everything to do with the government-- %$* 415
make the case. %$* 13
because they don't have resources. %$* 415
where are the play yards? %$* 415
where are the parks? %$* 415
where are the bike paths? %$* 415
okay. %$* 13
let me take that to john stossel. %$* 13
let me just take that to john stossel. %$* 13
i just want to say, though-- %$* 414
we haven't heard from him. %$* 13
all right, go ahead, very quickly. %$* 13
it would be very interesting to find these studies that paul is quoting saying that obesity was a major problem in the '50s. %$* 414
there's no such study. %$* 414
we looked at every-- %$* 414
forty percent of the american population was, quote, unquote, "overweight," in 1958, 40 percent, so apparently if there's been an epidemic, we've had an epidemic for a long time. %$* 416
but overweight-- %$* 414
i want to be clear about "overweight," because i know you've written, saying that people who are overweight are healthier. %$* 414
many people who are overweight are athletes who are muscular or people who work out, so we admit it in our books, we acknowledge that the bmi is not reliable in people who are muscular, who are athletes, and who work out. %$* 414
so i think that's a distortion. %$* 414
john stossel, i've been asking the other side for specifics on what the government can do. %$* 13
they're talking about building parks, playgrounds, sidewalks, to give people the chance to get physically fit, particularly in communities where we know those things are at a deficit. %$* 13
take that on. %$* 13
my understanding is that there are just as many or more parks, playgrounds and sidewalks as there have ever been. %$* 288
people can exercise if they wanted to. %$* 288
and john, you talked about they’re responding to this national emergency. %$* 288
that’s the justification for government, and i think you’re right. %$* 288
and that always is. %$* 288
the crisis is the friend of the state. %$* 288
but there-- %$* 288
the specialists always have emergencies. %$* 288
it’s terrorism or global warming or y2k.remember, the planes were all going to crash, and the killer bees were coming up from mexico, were going to sting us all to death, and bird flu and plastic bottles. %$* 288
it’s endless. %$* 288
it all requires government to intervene, to raise your taxes and to limit your freedom. %$* 288
pamela peeke. %$* 13
john says there’s plenty of sidewalks and parks. %$* 13
john. %$* 415
john, where the hell do you live? %$* 415
right here in new york city. %$* 288
honey, listen, get out of new york-- %$* 415
get out of new york and live, right. %$* 415
go out to the hinterland. %$* 415
go out to places where people don’t have these-- %$* 415
the hinterland is one big park. %$* 288
very seriously, john. %$* 415
i mean, really, what we’re looking at is the ability to be able to give people options. %$* 415
we keep telling people to go out and do whatever. %$* 415
eat less, move more. %$* 415
you give them food deserts. %$* 415
you don’t give them anywhere to move that’s safe. %$* 415
and then what do you have? %$* 415
where is that obesity? %$* 415
do i see a lot of obesity out here? %$* 415
i don’t think so. %$* 415
again, go to the hinterland. %$* 415
john, keep looking. %$* 415
it’s up there somewhere. %$* 415
you don’t have to go to the hinterland. %$* 414
there are many areas in this city and surrounding cities where it’s not safe to get out and walk in the street. %$* 414
it’s not safe. %$* 414
there’s no safe place. %$* 414
it’s safer than it used to be. %$* 288
crime is down. %$* 288
i’m sorry. %$* 414
it’s safer than it used to be. %$* 288
crime is down. %$* 288
and obesity is up. %$* 288
and it’s down in great part because of the same leadership that’s now saying that we’ve got to change the way we direct food to people. %$* 414
i want to move a little-- %$* 13
we’ve got to intervene to make sure that people know what they’re eating. %$* 414
i want to move to another part of the argument that paul campos has put out there, where he’s basically challenging the scientific underpinnings of the argument that you’re making. %$* 13
i mean, dr. %$* 13
satcher, you said that you’ve talked about-- %$* 13
you’ve discussed the association between obesity and diabetes. %$* 13
you didn’t-- %$* 13
causation-- %$* 13
you said an association. %$* 13
but paul campos, you’re saying that even that association doesn’t exist. %$* 13
no, the association exists, but the relationship is complex, right. %$* 416
i mean, the notion-- %$* 416
do we know that diabetes causes obesity? %$* 416
how do we know that obesity doesn’t cause diabetes? %$* 416
do we know? %$* 13
right, we-- %$* 416
in other words-- %$* 416
we don’t know-- %$* 414
we don’t know the cause of breast cancer. %$* 414
that doesn’t mean we don’t screen for it. %$* 414
we do know the association. %$* 414
well, yeah, but david, i don’t think-- %$* 416
in public health, we deal with associations. %$* 414
do you want to just perform mastectomies on women who don’t have breast cancer so they can avoid getting breast cancer? %$* 416
i don’t get the connection. %$* 414
the connection is-- %$* 416
okay, paul, paul. %$* 415
pamela peeke. %$* 13
whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah. %$* 415
in our laboratory, in the laboratories of many of our esteemed colleagues around the country, we’ve made it very clear that excessive visceral adiposity, a lot of fat deep inside your belly, is highly associated with a pro- inflammatory state, which increases the risk of diabetes, coronary vascular disease and cancer, period. %$* 415
i have that much literature to back up. %$* 415
yes, that’s right. %$* 416
and you know what? %$* 415
you can get rid of visceral body fat-- %$* 415
paul, let her finish. %$* 13
in addition, paul, the information that you presented showing that overweight is okay by me is actually wrong. %$* 415
and that has been refuted by at least two pooled meta- analyses publishes in lancet and the new england journal of medicine by my colleague, dr. %$* 415
walter willett from harvard and by leading epidemiologists around this country basically refuting your-- %$* 415
okay, let’s-- %$* 13
great. %$* 13
paul, go ahead. %$* 13
yeah, well, first of all, visceral body fat can be very effectively dealt with through changes in activity levels. %$* 416
it’s not going to-- %$* 416
but are you conceding that there’s a relationship between visceral body fat and-- %$* 13
there is a correlation between visceral body fat and increased health risks. %$* 416
that’s quite true, but the notion-- %$* 416
look, again, i want to emphasize the willingness to talk out of both sides of the mouth on this issue is just astonishing to me. %$* 416
you have people coming here and say obesity, obesity, obesity, right. %$* 416
we have this huge crisis. %$* 416
and then i point out this is a bunch of nonsense. %$* 416
and then it gets flipped around into, “well, we’re not really talking about obesity. %$* 416
we’re talking about lifestyle.” this isn’t called, you know, “is lifestyle the government’s business? %$* 416
” this doesn’t have a picture of a lifestyle on the front of it, right. %$* 416
david satcher. %$* 13
it has a picture of a-- %$* 416
come on, just wait a moment. %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
now, let’s be fair. %$* 414
obesity is an outcome, in many cases, of unhealthy lifestyles. %$* 414
it’s not that simple. %$* 414
we differ in terms of metabolism. %$* 414
there’re some people who can eat a lot of calories and not gain a lot of weight. %$* 414
there are other people who gain weight easily. %$* 414
so everybody’s not equal. %$* 414
we’re not stigmatizing people who are obese. %$* 414
read the surgeon general's report, clearly says this is not about appearances. %$* 414
it's about health. %$* 414
and the way to improve health is to change lifestyles. %$* 414
that's what the report says. %$* 414
all right. %$* 13
i'd like to go to the audience for some questions now. %$* 13
and reminding you of the point i made earlier. %$* 13
we'd like you to be terse, on point, a question that leads us to the discussion of government involvement with this issue of obesity and to really make it a question. %$* 13
and there's a gentleman right in the middle. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
i pointed to you. %$* 13
and if you can stand and state your name, and try to follow the rules. %$* 13
my name is mel zolkins first, one sentence statement. %$* 417
the function of our government-- %$* 417
one of the functions is to promote the general welfare, unquote. %$* 417
so now the one sentence question to mr. %$* 417
stossel is, what does that mean to you? %$* 417
wait. %$* 13
wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
stand up. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i'd like you to-- %$* 13
we can get john stossel going way off on this one. %$* 13
and i'd like you to focus that question more to the topic if you can. %$* 13
and i think you can probably do it with four or five words. %$* 13
so give it another shot. %$* 13
i'll leave that up to you. %$* 417
all right. %$* 13
you know what i have in mind, obviously. %$* 417
all right. %$* 13
but it would be so charming if you said it. %$* 13
you can say it better. %$* 417
john stossel, the gentleman is asking whether you feel that the government's responsibility for the social welfare includes the health of the individual. %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
and your opponents have talked about the enormous amount of government money that's spent on funding research that is saving people's lives. %$* 13
that costs money. %$* 13
that's taxes. %$* 13
looks like it has a benefit. %$* 13
is that the government's business? %$* 13
well, they mention the nih and basic research. %$* 288
and there is a better argument to be made that that does promote the general welfare. %$* 288
but if the general welfare means the obesity police or the lifestyle police, then there is no limit to what government can do. %$* 288
then they can reach into every crevice of your life. %$* 288
they can ban the dinner you're about to have. %$* 288
they can ban fat-- %$* 288
john, really? %$* 13
and ice cream. %$* 288
i mean-- %$* 13
i need-- %$* 13
this as a neutral journalist. %$* 13
i need to know what you're talking about when you talk about the-- %$* 13
you used to work at abc.you can't be a neutral journalist. %$* 288
sorry. %$* 288
i know. %$* 13
i know, i need to be more fair and balanced, john. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
john, i just want to know, when you're talking about these police telling us what we can eat for dinner, where is this-- %$* 13
you know, i know you're talking about a slippery slope. %$* 13
i can see that. %$* 13
but where-- %$* 13
be more detailed about this fear. %$* 13
i mean, where do you see this happening? %$* 13
you're talking about in terms of-- %$* 13
the discussion of soda taxes, issues like that. %$* 13
is that what you're talking about happening? %$* 13
well, that's part of it. %$* 288
i mean, thomas jefferson said it's the natural progress of things for government to grow and liberty to yield. %$* 288
government always grows. %$* 288
it starts with information. %$* 288
it moves to taxes. %$* 288
then it moves to limits on what you can consume. %$* 288
and now that we have obama care and the government says we're going to pay for your health care, then that's an argument to say, we have the right to have exercise police come into your home and make you improve your lifestyle. %$* 288
you start off by quoting-- %$* 414
david satcher. %$* 13
lincoln, so i'll quote lincoln who said that it is the role of government to do for people what they cannot do for themselves. %$* 414
and that's what we're talking about here. %$* 414
people can't lose weight for themselves? %$* 288
not if they don't have safe places to be physically active, not if they don't have access to fresh fruits and vegetables. %$* 414
and they can't be biggest loser because they don't own a tv. %$* 415
another question from the audience. %$* 13
well, that's going to be helpful. %$* 416
sir? %$* 13
oh, i meant a little farther back. %$* 13
striped sweater. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you don't mind stating your name. %$* 13
my name is noam gerber. %$* 418
and i was curious how would you respond to the idea that the government's role is to protect the collective rights of the citizens which overarches the protection of every one of our individual rights, and that the increase in obesity which represents that bridge represents a threat to our society, for example, the increase in rising costs of medicaid which we all have to put a-- %$* 418
which we all have to contribute to. %$* 418
okay. %$* 13
so i want to say that john really just answered the first part of your question, i think in terms of overall responsibility. %$* 13
but you're asking about whether-- %$* 13
whether in fact we're looking at a cost benefit between obesity on the one hand and the costs of treating people who would be ill with the diseases that this side is talking about. %$* 13
am i right? %$* 13
so i want to take that to paul campos. %$* 13
well, couple things. %$* 416
first of all, if you're concerned about rising medical costs, which you would be in favor of if you believe that obesity kills people, then much obesity is possible because what drives medical care costs through the roof is an aging population, all right? %$* 416
that's where the health care costs get spent, right? %$* 416
in an elderly population, supposedly obese people are all going to die before they get to be old, right, which is, of course, nonsense. %$* 416
but if you really did believe that, that's what would drive down health care costs. %$* 416
secondly, and i think more fundamentally-- %$* 416
and i just want to repeat this again. %$* 416
we cannot make fat people thin, okay? %$* 416
so even if it was desirable from a social perspective to produce a society that did not have a lot of fat people in it, you cannot do that in a developed economy, right? %$* 416
we have a situation in this country where we somehow got it into our heads that everybody can be within a certain narrow range of body mass if they have a healthy lifestyle. %$* 416
that's-- %$* 416
there's absolutely no reason for believing that that's true or that it's in any way necessary. %$* 416
so i mean, i'll tell you what, you know what really would reduce health care costs more than anything else? %$* 416
i can do a back of the envelope calculation right now. %$* 416
we can reduce healthcare costs by $1.7 trillion a year out of the 1.9 trillion that we spend by just having everybody be between the ages of 20 and 29. would drive health care costs down to the floor, right? %$* 416
but nobody is suggesting that we do that. %$* 416
and this is the same thing. %$* 416
it's suggesting that we have a population that is going to be completely above-- %$* 416
okay. %$* 13
both your opponents want to speak. %$* 13
that's a great question-- %$* 414
david-- %$* 13
david satcher. %$* 13
that you raise. %$* 414
let me just say that 80 percent of medicare costs-- %$* 414
and medicare is the most expensive program that government supports in terms of health. %$* 414
80 percent of their costs are due to preventable diseases. %$* 414
and certainly, half of that is related to obesity and type ii diabetes. %$* 414
there's no question about it. %$* 414
so it is true that the government has a self-interest to try to help people to develop healthy lifestyles. %$* 414
and we're not even talking about obesity. %$* 414
we're talking about the benefits of healthy lifestyles generally. %$* 414
less diabetes mellitus, which is a major driver of costs of medicare and other health programs. %$* 414
can we quit saying that we're trying to aim for turning fat people into thin people? %$* 415
this is-- %$* 415
just end it now, please. %$* 415
well, pamela-- %$* 13
this is ridiculous. %$* 415
but pamela-- %$* 13
we're going for healthy, and we're going for fit. %$* 415
we don't want life spans. %$* 415
we want health spans. %$* 415
we want the highest quality of life we can have. %$* 415
and if you started out at 250 pounds, and you're a 5'4" woman, and right now you're 180 and a happy camper, god bless you. %$* 415
so long as you're fit and happy. %$* 415
and we're also forgetting the head in this whole thing too. %$* 415
we're not science fair projects here. %$* 415
we forgot our heads. %$* 415
the stress factor here, of course we talked about stigma. %$* 415
no one wants to stigmatize. %$* 415
i'm a physician. %$* 415
i see this every day. %$* 415
i feel that pain and that-- %$* 415
and i feel that compassion as i try to help someone go south from 250 or whatever. %$* 415
what we're going for is health-- %$* 415
okay. %$* 13
and fitness. %$* 415
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to stop you because i think you made your point on that. %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i didn't mean that at all that way. %$* 13
i was going to ask for clarification. %$* 13
what are you looking for when you say it's not to get from heavy to thin, and you did answer it. %$* 13
in the third row here, just down front. %$* 13
hello. %$* 419
my name is jennifer sogus i'm an urban planner, and public health researcher here in new york city at transportation alternative. %$* 419
and i come from a school of thought that i appreciate dr. %$* 419
peeke that you spoke to a play street such as one of my signature programs at transportation alternative. %$* 419
i come from a school of thought that has proven that when people do not have access to playgrounds and sidewalks and bike lanes, that they are less physically active and that they are more overweight. %$* 419
so my question pertains to a particular piece of legislation on the table right now around transportation funding which, as written, prohibits federal funding from being spent on walking and biking and transit infrastructure. %$* 419
so my question to all of the panelists is, what is the role of government in funding or not funding things that encourage or discourage people from being physically active? %$* 419
i'd like john stossel to take it on first. %$* 13
i don't understand what you're talking about. %$* 288
the highway trust fund is already taken from drivers who pay the gas tax. %$* 288
and something like 20 percent of it is used for things like bike paths. %$* 288
so it's already being spent on these things. %$* 288
our government is spending $3.8 trillion. %$* 288
you want them to build grocery stores now? %$* 288
i mean, government can't even count the votes accurately, and you want them to fix lifestyle problems? %$* 288
this is a mistake. %$* 288
let's go to david satcher. %$* 13
well, i think we ought to be clear. %$* 414
you know, we are the government, and it is the role of government to create the conditions in which people can be healthy. %$* 414
that's how we define public health. %$* 414
that's how the institute of medicine defines public health. %$* 414
it is the role of public health to create the condition. %$* 414
it's a collective effort to create the conditions in which people can be healthy. %$* 414
and that's what we're talking about. %$* 414
but aren't there more opportunities to be healthy now than ever before? %$* 288
per capita income, a bicycle is cheaper than it used to be. %$* 288
there are more soccer leagues than there ever used to be. %$* 288
there's more awareness of physical activity. %$* 288
oh, i'm so sorry, did you forget about the fact that in the grand majority of schools across this country physical education is all but eliminated, it's gone? %$* 415
well, let's get rid of government schools-- %$* 288
and so we have-- %$* 415
and we'll have better school. %$* 288
and then in addition, john, in addition, john, for soccer, i'm sorry, that costs money. %$* 415
you have to have money to buy those soccer clothes. %$* 415
you have to have money to join the league. %$* 415
and those kids don't have it. %$* 415
so let's just see now. %$* 415
we eliminated recess. %$* 415
we don't have physical education. %$* 415
and now we don't have after school. %$* 415
and where do they go? %$* 415
to the tube, they just sit there. %$* 415
i just have to disagree-- %$* 288
new york city any kid can join a soccer league and if he doesn't have money the equipment will be given free. %$* 288
there's plenty of charities around to pay for that. %$* 288
let me remind you that schools are supposed to be the great equalizers in this country. %$* 414
in other words, kids come to school, some of them come from communities where they have adequate places to play, access to fresh fruits and vegetables. %$* 414
other children come from homes where there's no place to play safely, no access to fresh fruits and vegetables. %$* 414

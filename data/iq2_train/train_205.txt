was it worth a trillion dollars? %$* 13
eliot cohen, can you speak to, was it worth a trillion dollars? %$* 13
so let me get this straight. %$* 542
if we invade iraq, we depose saddam hussein and leave, that's an america whose global wings have been clipped, which is a good thing. %$* 542
no, we shouldn’t-- %$* 543
he was contained. %$* 543
that just-- %$* 542
that just makes-- %$* 542
that just makes no sense. %$* 542
wait, wait. %$* 13
let eliot finish. %$* 13
we'll come back to your point, by the way. %$* 542
since when i was in government, i was looking at the intelligence on the iranian parliament. %$* 542
it is very curious how they stopped their war head design program immediately after a major geopolitical event that occurred to their west. %$* 542
and that may have had a passing connection with it. %$* 542
lawrence korb. %$* 13
and they started it back when they saw how incompetent we were, the kind of investment we were making-- %$* 541
we-- %$* 542
we're losing confidence is better than incompetence. %$* 542
lawrence korb. %$* 13
that's not the topic being debated. %$* 542
i think-- %$* 543
and we get back-- %$* 543
look, there's a lot of evil in the world, and you have to decide whether the potential benefits are worth the costs that you have to pay. %$* 543
and that's why if you had told the american people that in the beginning, regardless of the outcome, you never would have gotten support. %$* 543
if you had asked people to raise taxes and to have a draft, which we should have done because of the fact that we overworked a lot of these young people, sent them back-- %$* 543
when i was in government, we got the voluntary military going. %$* 543
we made a compact with the young people. %$* 543
for every year you spend in the combat zone, you get at least two years at home. %$* 543
it didn't work. %$* 543
okay, you got 500,000 people, according to rand, who have mental problems because of being over-deployed. %$* 543
if you took iraq and afghanistan out of this equation, peter galbraith, where do you disagree with the other side? %$* 13
well, i'm in favor of a more limited role where we have allies intervening where-- %$* 541
if we are to intervene, to intervene where we have allies, generally consistent with international law, where there are partners on the ground. %$* 541
i think there are circumstances-- %$* 541
and you think your opponents are for what? %$* 13
libya is another. %$* 541
but you think your opponent's position is what then? %$* 13
well, they don't want to talk about afghanistan and iraq and this very expansive nation- building enterprise in which both of them were-- %$* 541
administration in which both of them were very intimately involved. %$* 541
now, if their position is that they are also in favor-- %$* 541
you know that they will never do that kind of thing again, and that they'll clip america's wings because we're not going to try-- %$* 541
and we'll get out of afghanistan or reduce our forces to something that's commensurate with an achievable mission, then maybe we're on the same wavelength. %$* 541
are they in favor of the hundred thousand dollar mission-- %$* 541
a hundred thousand dollar mission in afghanistan? %$* 541
but, peter, let elliott abrams come in. %$* 13
here's the problem with that. %$* 544
first of all, you guys disagree about iraq because peter correctly, in my view said, you know, if we had been able to go in, depose saddam hussein, save the kurds and the shia and then, in your view, get out, that would have been worth doing. %$* 544
now, how in hell do you go into iraq and depose saddam hussein in three weeks with your clipped wings? %$* 544
you can't do it. %$* 544
you need to maintain the military that larry doesn’t want us to maintain in order to achieve exactly that goal. %$* 544
wait, wait. %$* 543
wait a second. %$* 543
larry korb-- %$* 13
we went in with-- %$* 543
okay, larry korb. %$* 13
bill clinton's military, the one you said wasn’t big enough. %$* 543
it wasn’t bush's military that went in. %$* 543
it was john kerry, i'm sorry. %$* 544
and we were spending on defense, about half on the baseline of what we’re spending now. %$* 543
and we marched through baghdad in three weeks. %$* 543
could i make a request in this debate that this not become republican-democrat, and that, that old-- %$* 13
that old shape-- %$* 13
okay? %$* 13
not to say that the wars we’re talking about are not material, but i don’t want to go down that old ground. %$* 13
i think we’re talking about something fairly important here and i think we are talking about principles. %$* 13
and it does sound to me as though these two sides agree on the broad principle that the u.s.has a role in the world, wants to try to influence events. %$* 13
both sides are agreeing on that, and i’m beginning to wonder where the essential disagreement really is unless you are saying it just costs too much on this side and on your side i’m not sure what your comeback is to that. %$* 13
it doesn’t cost too much. %$* 544
the fact is that-- %$* 544
elliott abrams. %$* 13
the percentage of gdp that we are spending on defense continues to decline. %$* 544
what is going up in this country, and i think everybody here knows it, is entitlement spending, and that is what has tied the congress in knots, because there are very few politicians in either party bold enough to deal with entitlement spending. %$* 544
we are not broke because of the military budget. %$* 544
now wait a second, wait a second. %$* 543
let’s go back and take a look. %$* 543
you look at the discretionary budget, the budget that doesn’t deal with entitlements, things that people have earned, like military retirement, these thing-- %$* 543
if you look at discretion-- %$* 543
defense is half of the discretionary budget. %$* 543
and right now the politicians of washington have frozen nondefense discretionary. %$* 543
that’s not going to help, i agree we need to take a look at the other things. %$* 543
i mentioned president reagan in 1983 worked on it. %$* 543
but the fact of the matter is you don’t just ignore half of the discretionary budget, particularly if you cut it. %$* 543
and you mentioned alice rivlin. %$* 543
did you read the report of the domenici-rivlin commission? %$* 543
no. %$* 18
she said cut $100 billion in defense by 2015. %$* 18
all right, i want to go to the audience for some questions in a moment. %$* 13
i’d like you to prepare your questions, again, terse questions that have a question mark at the end, and to the point of the debate, and microphones will circulate and when you’re chosen and a microphone comes to you, please stand up and hold it about a fist distance away from your mouth so that the radio audience will be able to hear you clearly. %$* 13
but i want to take one more shot at this issue of whether we’re really talking about execution and price tag only, if in a fantasy world, and it may be therefore irrelevant, if we had unlimited resources, would that mean to the side that’s arguing for clipping america’s wings, carrying your argument out, that our limitation is financial only if we didn’t have that limitation, would you be for doing all kinds of zany stuff out there? %$* 13
well, afghanistan is the perfect case in point, and this is probably an issue in which we have a very concrete ongoing difference. %$* 541
in afghanistan we have 100,000 troops, $117 billion committed to a strategy which cannot work because it-- %$* 541
the essential element for success which is an afghan partner does not exist. %$* 541
so we don’t need to-- %$* 541
and yet i suspect they would continue this. %$* 541
well, why don’t we put it to them? %$* 541
yeah good question. %$* 13
i mean, how do you make a counterinsurgency work when you don’t have a partner? %$* 541
eliot cohen. %$* 13
first i wouldn't say that we don’t have a partner, i mean we have a weak partner. %$* 542
if we had a strong partner there wouldn’t be an insurgency because these things are basically about governance. %$* 542
and do i think we’re going to be there for a long time? %$* 542
yes. %$* 542
do i think we had any choice about going in there? %$* 542
no. %$* 542
remember, this was the good war. %$* 542
this is the war that everybody i dare say including both of you were in favor of in 2001. %$* 542
and it is the problem that elliot has pointed out which is correct, once you go in there-- %$* 542
so what exactly are you going to do, are you just going to sort of leave the thing in chaos and not do anything? %$* 542
now we can argue back and forth about did we do the smart thing, did we do the stupid thing, should we have backed somebody other than karzai, should we have organized that place differently, should we have had different ambassadors? %$* 542
that’s not the point. %$* 542
the point is this proposition about clipping america’s global wings. %$* 542
by the way, i cannot imagine ronald reagan ever signing up for that sort of proposition. %$* 542
and as long as i have the floor, one other-- %$* 542
for about 10 seconds, %$* 13
tell me how cutting the defense budget by $100 billion makes all the fat people out there lose weight-- %$* 542
increases life expectancy and gets the kids away from nintendo and into the calculus books. %$* 542
i don’t get it. %$* 542
now, let me come back-- %$* 543
lawrence korb. %$* 13
let me make a point here, because i agree. %$* 543
we went into afghanistan. %$* 543
the problem was and this is what i’m talking about, clipping your wings, selective engagement. %$* 543
you didn’t finish the job in afghanistan. %$* 543
you diverted your attention to iraq. %$* 543
and you allowed afghanistan to deteriorate. %$* 543
i agree, afghanistan was the right war. %$* 543
and, in fact, i commended president bush because he told-- %$* 543
in the beginning, he said to the taliban, “you turn over al-qaeda, we’ll leave you alone.” they didn’t, so we went in. %$* 543
we had to. %$* 543
the problem was, within months, we started diverting our attention to iraq, which was not a critical issue, had nothing to do with 9/11. back when eisenhower was president, we were spending 10 percent of the gdp on defense, we didn’t go into vietnam. %$* 543
one more thing before we go to audience questions. %$* 13
eliot cohen, you said earlier that you feel your opponents basically think that power is bad, but i’m not hearing that from them at all. %$* 13
i’m sorry, elliot abrams-- %$* 13
was it elliot abrams that made that point about-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 542
we’re practically interchangeable. %$* 542
just for the spelling, but other than that-- %$* 544
so, i’m not hearing that. %$* 13
if you find that the defense budget is not killing our economy, and i think it’s ridiculous to urge that it is, then why are we doing this wing-clipping stuff? %$* 544
what is it we’re trying to stop? %$* 544
the only word i’ve heard is nation-building. %$* 544
now, you know, we did nation building in germany after world war ii.we did it japan after world war ii.we’re trying to do it in a number of other places. %$* 544
generally, people are ending up a lot better off after we try to do the nation-building. %$* 544
so i think ask myself, well, if we’re trying to build democracy-- %$* 544
this is colin powell’s old “you break it, you bought it,” the pottery barn rule-- %$* 544
we go into the country and we say, “no, we’re not going to depose the head of government and leave it a shambles. %$* 544
we’re going to try to help them build a decent country here and build a democracy.” that’s a good thing to do, and i must say i don’t understand the argument except financial for saying-- %$* 544
but i’m still not hearing you respond to your earlier statements that this team actually is uncomfortable exerting american power. %$* 13
that’s what i-- %$* 13
it sounded like you’re saying it, and yet i don’t think that that’s any-- %$* 13
if they are comfortable asserting american power, then i think their argument simply falls apart or becomes just a sort of financial argument, that we would love to run the world, but, you know, we’re broke this year. %$* 544
no, no, no, no. %$* 543
we’re not saying that. %$* 543
we’re saying trying to run the world does cost you a lot of money that you don’t have to spend. %$* 543
and, even if-- %$* 543
but you’re good with running the world. %$* 13
if you had all the money, you got to look at selective engagement. %$* 543
you cannot save the world, okay? %$* 543
there are a lot of problems in the world that you can’t deal with that you have to live with. %$* 543
you ask me what’s the most dangerous place in the world? %$* 543
pakistan. %$* 543
all right? %$* 543
you want to send troops into pakistan? %$* 543
okay? %$* 543
you’re not going to do that. %$* 543
and, again, you should have thought about that before you went into, you know, you went into iraq and took your eye off the ball in afghanistan. %$* 543
all right. %$* 13
let me go to some questions. %$* 13
and there’s a gentleman-- %$* 13
i’m looking right-- %$* 13
yes, and you gestured correctly. %$* 13
if you would stand, sir, and give the camera four seconds to find you, and it has. %$* 13
and, again, if anyone is asking questions is a member of the media, we’d appreciate you identifying yourself. %$* 13
just do us a favor. %$* 13
but please, go ahead. %$* 13
yes, i have a question for mr. %$* 18
abrams. %$* 18
doesn’t the law of unintended consequences rear its head, for example, in somalia we went in to restore order, and we wound up with black hawk down and the troops being dragged through the street. %$* 18
we funded the mujahedeen in afghanistan. %$* 18
that turned out to be al-qaeda. %$* 18
you mentioned rwanda. %$* 18
you had two african tribes hacking each other up with machetes. %$* 18
do you really want to send american troops into these places when, frequently, it turns-- %$* 18
it backfires to our detriment? %$* 18
do you think those were overreaches of power? %$* 13
well, obviously, you have-- %$* 18
basically, you judge a situation by what happened, by the consequences, not by what was intended. %$* 18
but, obviously, in those situations-- %$* 18
by the outcome. %$* 13
we downed it to our detriment. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
elliot abrams. %$* 13
the question of unintended consequences is a very important question. %$* 544
and you can cite a number of examples where we-- %$* 544
for over 50 years, where we did something wrong or foolishly or incompetently. %$* 544
but take rwanda, your example. %$* 544
there are hundreds of thousands of dead people in rwanda because we did nothing. %$* 544
and bill clinton has said it is the greatest regret, he has said, about his presidency, that he did nothing to stop it. %$* 544
now, the repertoire is large and doesn’t only include sending in the marines. %$* 544
we have no marines in libya, but we are intervening in a way that is meant to do some good, and with which i agree. %$* 544
so, yeah, you’ve got to-- %$* 544
i guess the argument is, yes, you need to be very careful whenever you commit american troops. %$* 544
you need to be very careful even if you’re not committing american troops. %$* 544
you’re committing american prestige and money. %$* 544
but i don’t think that can be an argument for inaction. %$* 544
it can’t be an argument for saying, “we don’t really know what’s going to happen tomorrow in srebrenica. %$* 544
let’s not go in. %$* 544
we don't really know if saddam hussein will massacre the kurds. %$* 544
let's leave it alone. %$* 544
it takes you too far.” %$* 544
peter galbraith, you want to follow on that as an opponent? %$* 13
well, i think the question of the mujahedeen in afghanistan's a very good one because we simply allowed the pakistani dictator, zia-ul-haq under the reagan administration, to decide who to fund. %$* 541
and he funded the most extreme elements. %$* 541
and we are now living with the consequences of that. %$* 541
i want to come to the question of, you know, should web in the business of nation building, building democracies? %$* 541
yes. %$* 541
we had an interest in removing the taliban. %$* 541
we had an interest in trying to kill or capture al-qaeda. %$* 541
what interest did we have in trying to build a strong central government in afghanistan, a place that has never had one and will not have one in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room, even young people? %$* 541
okay. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
what interest did we have in-- %$* 541
peter, i'm going to interrupt because that was a self-asked question, and i'm-- %$* 13
i'm wanting to really hear from the audience in this. %$* 13
but that doesn't mean you can't get to that in your closing remarks. %$* 13
let me just go to the far side here. %$* 13
and there's-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
you have a colorful sleeve. %$* 13
you're welcome. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, they'll find you. %$* 13
could you stand? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
yeah, i'd just like to ask, you're talking about cutting-- %$* 19
to mr. %$* 19
abrams-- %$* 19
about cutting entitlements as one way to deal with america's deficit problem. %$* 19
but not a single one of the panelists tonight has talked about tax extensions or tax breaks to the super wealthy or to-- %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
lovely question. %$* 13
and that is a huge hole in this argument. %$* 19
and stay tuned for a future debate from intelligence squared u.s.on that topic. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i really want to stay on the power clipping issue. %$* 13
taxes to support the war. %$* 18
sir, there's a-- %$* 13
a little farther back, three back. %$* 13
if you could stand, thanks. %$* 13
president eisenhower spoke of the military industrial complex. %$* 18
and as long as we have so many people in the military and government and in business interested in creating such a great military industrial complex, won't we continue to be in these kinds of wars and have these kinds of-- %$* 18
but how would you relate that, sir, to our motion about clipping-- %$* 13
well, i think part of the reason we're not clipping america's global wings is enough people are interested in keeping the military. %$* 18
and once you-- %$* 18
you have a large military, somebody's going to use it. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to let that stand as a comment because it's not quite to our point. %$* 13
ma'am in the blue-- %$* 13
teal, the teal. %$* 13
is that teal? %$* 13
did i get that right? %$* 13
huge number of-- %$* 19
i'd like to commend the lady over there for having questioned the attack on entitlements. %$* 19
i believe mr. %$* 19
abrams spoke about the marshall plan having been a very constructive thing. %$* 19
what about a marshall plan for the american people who are now suffering-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to let that stand as a comment as well. %$* 13
it's clear that we know what your view is. %$* 13
folks, really-- %$* 13
i really want you to try to bring it in, just to land these things perfectly. %$* 13
sir, blue blazer, yeah. %$* 13
yeah, hi. %$* 18
i think to the point, i don't know if-- %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
yeah, i don't know if the story is true, but i've heard that benjamin franklin apparently wanted the turkey to be our national bird. %$* 18
but we chose instead the eagle, a bird with strong wings. %$* 18
and i think the argument can be made that america without strong wings is simply not america. %$* 18
you think it's an identity issue literally? %$* 13
i think it has to do with who we are and why we're here. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
do you feel that this-- %$* 13
the question is, i think the argument is being made strongly that perhaps we should be-- %$* 18
we should not be stupid in how we use our strength and our wealth and our forces. %$* 18
we should be smarter about how we do it. %$* 18
but can you really argue that america should clip its wings as opposed to simply being smarter and more efficient about how we use-- %$* 18
lawrence korb. %$* 13
and that's such a great question. %$* 13
and don't miss it, okay? %$* 13
since you used a metaphor here, there's a great book written by a professor here at this wonderful university, peter beinart. %$* 543
it's called “the icarus syndrome.” and he said throughout our history, we get carried away thinking that because of who we are we can solve all the world's problems. %$* 543
and he goes back, and he talks about vietnam where we went in, we thought the domino theory and all of that type of thing, found out we even-- %$* 543
when our economy was much better, we still could not achieve the objective that we wanted. %$* 543
and that's what-- %$* 543
you used the term, you've got to be smart about it, there are certain things you've got to do, other things you realize that they're beyond your capacity. %$* 543
and i think that's the key thing. %$* 543
now, at this particular time, we talk about the fact that defense has nothing to do with it. %$* 543
no. %$* 543
we added $2 trillion to the deficit in the last decade because of actions that happened from 2001 to 2008, okay? %$* 543
if we had those $2 trillion, the other problems would not be as bad. %$* 543
and so that's the point i'm making. %$* 543
all right. %$* 13
let's hear from your opponents on this topic, eliot cohen. %$* 13
on the-- %$* 542
on the eagle, the national seal has the eagle clutching arrows and olive branches. %$* 542
and originally, the eagle pointed at the arrows. %$* 542
and harry truman welcomed winston churchill to the white house. %$* 542
and he very proudly pointed to him that he'd redesigned the seal so that the eagle's head looked at the olive branches. %$* 542
and churchill said-- %$* 542
wise thing. %$* 542
he said, "you know, my view is the eagle's head should be mounted on a swivel." so it can look either at the olive branch or at the arrows as is necessary. %$* 542
he didn't say anything about clipping the damn bird's wings. %$* 542
thank you, sir, for the question. %$* 13
with the program in your hand, arise, and a microphone will find its way to you. %$* 13
question. %$* 13
the side in favor of the resolution has talked about a lot of interventions in retrospect and the cost and how we have allies that aren't accountable or are corrupt. %$* 19
and i want to know from both sides what criteria you think the american public ought to use right now to determine which interventions are acceptable, which ones are not? %$* 19
what are the rules, in other words? %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
i'd like to ask you-- %$* 13
i'd like to ask you each to answer this excellent question in-- %$* 13
no, seriously, but in a bullet format. %$* 13
i'd just like to hear your list from each side, what it takes. %$* 13
and i know that, peter, you actually touched on some of it earlier. %$* 13
but either of you can take it and tell us the four or five most important elements. %$* 13
i was-- %$* 541
i'm glad you asked the question because i was just writing down some bullet points on exactly this. %$* 541
first, i think when we intervene, it's very important that we operate with the vision of the people on whose behalf we are intervening, not ours. %$* 541
i think that's my main critique of what we've done in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 541
why did we want to disassemble kurdistan and iraq? %$* 541
it worked. %$* 541
why build a central government? %$* 541
but that would, to me, be the most important point. %$* 541
second-- %$* 541
and what else? %$* 13
defer to the judgment of others, including in the international community, the u.n., our allies. %$* 541
don't go it alone. %$* 541
and finally, i would take a count of the costs and the benefits. %$* 541
when we intervened in bosnia, it was a-- %$* 541
yes, it was by air, but it was for a short period of time, relatively inexpensive incidentally, and all our interventions in both bosnia, kosovo, not a single american or nato soldier died in hostile combat-- %$* 541
okay. %$* 13
let me go to the other-- %$* 13
and finally-- %$* 541
finally, as a vermonter, i have to say, turkeys have very strong wings. %$* 541
we have lots of wild turkeys. %$* 541
now to this side. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 542
i-- %$* 542
eliot cohen, question. %$* 13
first thing i think when you're talking about the use of force, the question is always, are we going to avoid something worse. %$* 542
and i think that it's important to be very serious about this. %$* 542
using force is a terrible thing. %$* 542
you're going to kill innocent civilians. %$* 542
you're going to make mistakes. %$* 542
you'll probably get some of your own people killed. %$* 542
and those are real people. %$* 542
are you going to avoid something worse? %$* 542
that's really the fundamental reason why we do go to war, and we should go to war. %$* 542
is this doable as far as we can-- %$* 542
as far as we can guess? %$* 542
and it is a guess. %$* 542
is it in our self-interest? %$* 542
and is it in our broader interest as americans? %$* 542
from the very founding of this country, we're caught between the tension between the same kind of interest that other countries have and our ideals. %$* 542
that's what it is to be an american. %$* 542
and it's incumbent upon our leaders to wrestle with that and to lay it out for us. %$* 542
but above all, at the end of it, don't think that any of us can come up with a set of rules which we can, you know, give you, and that's a sort of a decision making guide that any president can take with him or her to make a decision. %$* 542
no, but the question did reveal a great deal with how the two sides think. %$* 13
and i thank you for it. %$* 13
and i want to take it one step further. %$* 13
i want you to respond to the list that you heard over there, and do you have any disagreement with it? %$* 13
or would you add his list to your list? %$* 13
i would-- %$* 18
i would critical question here. %$* 544
and i think elliott is right in saying when we intervene militarily, the chances are that some innocent people and some american servicemen and women will be killed. %$* 544
so the question is to what end? %$* 544
and if the answer is, i'm not sure, you don't do it. %$* 544
if the answer is, to save a million lives, or 500,000 lives, to stop darfur, to stop srebrenica, then the balance may shift. %$* 544
okay, and, lawrence, can you respond to what you heard? %$* 13
well, i’m going to very quickly-- %$* 543
lawrence, can you respond to their list? %$* 13
okay. %$* 543
thanks. %$* 13
i have very quick multilateral if you can, unilateral only if you must. %$* 543
i think that's what you have to do, and you have to basically ask yourself that question and the same thing in terms of what you can't know exactly ahead of time but you can do a pretty good idea of the cost and the benefits and recognize that you don't just use the military to solve all these problems. %$* 543
okay, so that's your list. %$* 13
what's your response to what you heard from the other side? %$* 13
would you-- %$* 13
do you agree with what they-- %$* 13
well, my response to them is basically if you take a look at a lot of the operations we do, they haven’t done that ahead of time in terms of the cost and the benefits. %$* 543
guilty? %$* 13
you have to take the point that eliot made at the end, you can’t predict the future or at least you can’t predict it perfectly. %$* 544
you do the best you can, you use the best intel you can, you try to make the best guess as to what the costs will be and what the benefits will be, and sometimes you get it on the dime, and sometimes you’re way off. %$* 544
according to colin powell-- %$* 543
look, i-- %$* 542
bush never did that before he went into iraq. %$* 543
eliot cohen. %$* 13
never was %$* 18
eliot cohen. %$* 13
i’ve sat in nsc meetings and i know first that presidents take these issues very, very seriously, particularly when they're committing american lives. %$* 542
that was true of george w.bush, was true of barack obama, it was true of bill clinton. %$* 542
i also know that none of these decisions are easy. %$* 542
they don’t get to that level if they were easy, and so there are always going to be-- %$* 542
there’s going to be an element of guesswork, and then an element of risk. %$* 542
the other thing, by the way, is we have really focused, because this is the preoccupation of the other team, on these high end interventions. %$* 542
there are other kinds of things. %$* 542
let’s talk about the sudan peace process, let’s talk about what’s been really quite a tremendous success in columbia which has been an exercise of american power in many dimensions including the nonmilitary, this is not a debate about american military power, it’s america’s global wings, and those wings include a lot of nonmilitary elements which have been tremendously successful. %$* 542
all right, we’re going to take a quick break. %$* 13
our motion is, “it’s time to clip america’s global wings.” we’re going to take a quick break, and we’ll be right back with more questions from the audience. %$* 13
so i’m going to ask you in a second to help assist coming back from the break in the radio broadcast and television broadcast to applaud, and once you do and as the applause dies away, i’ll reintroduce the broadcast and we’ll go back to your questions. %$* 13
so can i have a round of applause, please? %$* 13
our motion is, "it’s time to clip america’s global wings." this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have two debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "it’s time to clip america’s global wings." we are taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
the man in the blue shirt, you’ve been very patient. %$* 13
oh, i’m sorry. %$* 13
you know, everybody in the audience could’ve stood up at that point. %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 13
i grew up as a child in africa surrounded on one side by cubans and on another side by russians, who were spreading their wings, and the one safe thing we always felt as children was, we had the united states, and we were enfolded within its wings. %$* 18
what would you feel if we clipped the wings with russia now, with-- %$* 18
i beg your pardon-- %$* 18
china now spreading its wings, and you now clip your wings, how secure would everybody feel? %$* 18
do you-- %$* 13
and i want to clarify-- %$* 13
do you feel that that’s the argument that this side, arguing for clipping wings, is making? %$* 13
yeah, i feel-- %$* 18
you do, that they’re putting you at risk? %$* 13
i feel they’re putting us at risk. %$* 18
all right, i want to take that question to the side that’s arguing for clipping america’s global wings. %$* 13
let me go-- %$* 543
lawrence korb. %$* 13
i think you raise a great point. %$* 543
china is gaining because we’re bogged down in afghanistan. %$* 543
they would love us to be there forever, keep spending all of this money and help their a foreign policy objectives. %$* 543
they’re a free rider in the middle east. %$* 543
we’re doing-- %$* 543
what’s china doing? %$* 543
sitting back and taking advantage of it. %$* 543
so i think our point is that, you know, when you say clip your wings, you’ve got to work with the rest of the community. %$* 543
we can’t have too many free riders. %$* 543
it’s very interesting when the deficit came up in britain and france, they cut their defense spending. %$* 543
they cut it. %$* 543
and then, of course, who has to pick up the thing? %$* 543
we do. %$* 543
well, i’m glad that president obama said, “wait a second. %$* 543
you have more interest in libya than we do.” and i’m glad that the international community did it. %$* 543
so, i think you’re going to look at china. %$* 543
they’re doing great because they’re a free rider. %$* 543
sir, can you-- %$* 13
i just want to ask you about your response to their response, but briefly. %$* 13
i feel that china has got such great ambitions and they’re now growing their military, which was on tv just the other day, that to send the message that america’s going to start clipping its wings is going encourage them to go into places they wouldn’t normally even think of going to. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
let me come to the other side. %$* 13
eliot cohen. %$* 13
a couple of months ago, i had 10 days in japan before the awful events of the tsunami and the reactor incident. %$* 542
and the main thing we were talking about, particularly with the defense and foreign policy people are these little islands called the senkakus, which have been japanese territory for a very, very long time. %$* 542
the chinese have a claim. %$* 542
and, of course, it’s not so much that they care about the islands. %$* 542
they care about the territorial waters and so forth. %$* 542
and the japanese are under a lot of pressure, and they are actually quite fearful about the possibility of a chinese grab for those islands. %$* 542
by the way, the chinese really do say, “that water is ours.” japanese do not – then most certainly do not want to see america’s global wings clipped. %$* 542
and i assure you that today they want it even less, when 18,000 american servicemen and women, 22 warships of the united states navy are helping that country deal with the worst catastrophe that it’s faced since world war ii. and a good thing. %$* 542
peter galbraith, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
well, the problem is that national security resources-- %$* 541
money, troops-- %$* 541
are not unlimited. %$* 541
and so you have to make choices. %$* 541
and if you make choices to deploy them in afghanistan in pursuit of a strategy that, on the face of it, isn’t working, those resources are not available to deal with other threats or other national security issues, be it china, be it north korea, be it iran. %$* 541
and so, when we talk about clipping america’s wings, what we’re really talking about is not making-- %$* 541
removing american from the world stage. %$* 541
we’re talking about moving away from very ambitious exercises in nation building-- %$* 541
afghanistan, iraq are two cases in point-- %$* 541
to a selective use of power so that we can-- %$* 541
a selective use of these scarce resources so that we can focus on the real challenges. %$* 541
that’s all. %$* 541
you know, the gentleman with the red sweater, you wanted to ask a question because you had a blue shirt. %$* 13
i just felt i got you up there, i sat you down-- %$* 13
but i hope it’s a good question. %$* 13
if we refuse to clip our wings in any way, shape, or form, if we insist on american adventurism, then why don’t we simply tax everybody on a pay-as-you-go basis and say, “these are the choices that you’ve made. %$* 18
you must pay for it at the end of every year.” %$* 18
i’m going to let-- %$* 13
i’m going to let that stand as an interesting comment, which it is, but i don’t think it actually moves our discussion. %$* 13
sir, yep, yep, you just touched it-- %$* 13
could you stand up please? %$* 13
hi, thank you. %$* 18
thank you all for being here. %$* 18
i just thought to myself, geez, the last 50 years we’ve borrowed a lot of money to kill people in wars. %$* 18
and here we are, 2011, and we’re borrowing money to keep our own people alive here in the u.s. %$* 18
it’s crazy. %$* 18
in any case, i believe that we can clip our wings in defense, but we can expand our wings in technology and alternative energy. %$* 18
would any of you be opening to maybe clipping wings in defense or, if you’re not open to it, maybe the bond market may be open to it, but let’s expand our wings with new entities, new enterprise, and move away from this consistent defense increase year over year. %$* 18
thank you so much. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
peter galbraith. %$* 13
i think you make actually quite an important point, which is that we’ve had this go-it- alone policy in the world, which has been very expensive as larry korb has made the point. %$* 541
we’ve had a lot of free riders on it. %$* 541
and the end result has been diminishing, particularly in the last-- %$* 541
in the previous administration, diminishing america’s influence in the world. %$* 541
and so one of the ideas of not doing these kinds of things, being selective, having a sensible defense budget is we might actually be able to devote resources in ways that would increase our influence in the world. %$* 541
you know, we were totally isolated on the issue of global warming. %$* 541
everybody else recognizes this as a problem. %$* 541

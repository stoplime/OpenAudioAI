and i urge you to resist that, to stand back, look at the bigger picture, and do not issue the blanket condemnation. %$* 196
tyler, you're saying sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex? %$* 13
there are many instances where the practice is badly regulated and we observe bad outcomes. %$* 196
trafficking is an example. %$* 196
none of us are defending that, but that’s not the proposition. %$* 196
is it, to the other team, is it ever, is there a sometimes, or sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex? %$* 13
melissa farley? %$* 13
i would like to address this trafficked toddlers issue, which is basically ranking victims. %$* 195
when you decide that a battered woman is not really harmed because her arm wasn’t broken, or a slave isn't harmed as much if they're in the house as opposed to in the fields, or a woman in prostitution is not harmed as much if she’s a little older. %$* 195
and i’d like to tell you that a friend of mine who works in the field of child prostitution recently told me that there’s now a move to only rank genuine victims of prostitution of children if they're pre- pubescent. %$* 195
so the age is always going down, we’re always carving out some group that it’s okay to use in prostitution. %$* 195
i think when we make these false distinctions, we’re agreeing to set aside a class of human beings, the ones that make more, they're a little older, a little this, a little that. %$* 195
we’re setting aside some people who’s suffering we agree to ignore. %$* 195
we're going to go to audience questions now and bring up the house lights, and begin to raise your hands, and we’ll get microphones over to you. %$* 13
but melissa, i don’t, in a way i think you actually glanced off my question with what you were saying, but tyler cowen is arguing that sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex. %$* 13
he used the example of sexual surrogates, he used the example, not using the word quadriplegic, but that was implied, that somebody who may not have an opportunity for another sexual experience, and therefore hires a prostitute. %$* 13
and he says that in those cases sometimes it is okay to pay for sex. %$* 13
right— %$* 193
wendy shalit? %$* 13
yes, i’d like to address that, because i think those are really important points that he raised. %$* 193
if you show me anyone who, a man who is handicapped, i will give you a man with the same disability who has a woman who loves him. %$* 193
and women are not that superficial. %$* 193
and if somebody, if, i'm sorry, there’s a lot of women who love men %$* 193
and, and %$* 193
if there’s somebody who’s using prostitution as an excuse, i think that's a problem. %$* 193
and i, about this issue of, that prostitution is really altruism because it’s feeding, you know, poor women, and that’s part of the diversity, i understand that, but i fail to see how that justifies it from the male perspective. %$* 193
if you really want to be altruistic, just give her a loaf of bread. %$* 193
a question from the middle of the aisle. %$* 13
and, and i beg you to keep it terse. %$* 13
oh yeah, no, of course. %$* 10
thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 10
so i'm in college, and i remember very distinctly that when i was in middle school our sexual education is a three year program, but there are only so many ways that you can describe, you know, the act of sex, so what we focused on eventually was disease, and i was wondering if anybody on the panel had any opinions about disease in this scenario, especially, i would like to ask specifically miss barrows about, if she had any experiences with this while she was running cache. %$* 10
back when i was in business, there was no such thing as aids.well, there was in the gay community but no one really heard about it yet, because i was out of business in 1984.the way that this, the upscale call girl business ran back then is, the young ladies did not wear condoms. %$* 198
if, i mean, the men didn't wear condoms, and young ladies couldn't insist on it. %$* 198
if they did not agree to that, then they didn't have to work for us. %$* 198
but i mean, the thing, there was pretty much nobody they could have worked for in the city, because that’s the way everybody did it. %$* 198
i do have to say that we did have, once, we had a problem with gonorrhea, i paid for all my young ladies to go to the doctor, and i also called up all the other agencies that i knew were sort of in my category, and told them that, you know, we should, everybody should insist that the clients wear condoms. %$* 198
and you know what these other women said to me, what do you care about these girls? %$* 198
they, you know, they wouldn't care this much about you. %$* 198
and i was absolutely horrified. %$* 198
so you know, there %$* 198
it’s true that there are a lot of bad people out there who are running businesses like this, but there are also a lot of people out there, because i'm not the only one, who genuinely care about the girls who work for us, and would never, ever, ever put them knowingly in harm’s way. %$* 198
melissa farley do you want to also take up the question of, based on your research, and take up the disease question, and is it central to the argument? %$* 13
it’s not what we heard from women in prostitution that this is their main concern, is physical, even physical injuries. %$* 195
the main concern is to get out and to figure out how to get out. %$* 195
and the thing that causes them the most suffering is the psychological damage that’s extremely long lasting. %$* 195
the bruises and the-- %$* 195
they even heal from the rapes. %$* 195
so this is what i’ve heard. %$* 195
i think when someone, let me, cac i say one other thing— %$* 195
yes, please do. %$* 13
about disability? %$* 195
i think prejudice against someone who has a physical or emotional disability is wrong. %$* 195
the cure to that prejudice is not selling someone to that person so they can have sex. %$* 195
the cure is to address the disability-ism, and the looks-ism in our culture. %$* 195
i’ve told you that you’d be number two, i’d like to put you to number three, because i’d like to bring different sexes into the discussion. %$* 13
and there’s a gentleman, and you’ll be third %$* 13
yes, you’ll be number three. %$* 13
my question is for professor cowen, there was a case in germany, i actually don’t know what the outcome was, but assuming that this is a country where there is well regulated prostitution, where a woman was denied unemployment benefits because she had not tried to become a prostitution. %$* 9
so, my question for you is, if prostitution, is if we’re going to have a well regulated prostitution, is it going to be treated like any other profession? %$* 9
because if so, obviously every woman always has that alternative, and therefore the state can ask women to become prostitutes instead of getting unemployment benefits. %$* 9
my understanding of the german story is that it’s quite different from how you described it, that the woman simply was given a list and asked what other professions she had tried to seek out, that she was not in any way forced to become a prostitute. %$* 196
but putting that example aside, if indeed that were the case, that is an example of a silly rule, a silly regulation. %$* 196
none of us here are for that. %$* 196
but pointing out that that’s a silly way of running unemployment benefits does not establish the blanket condemnation behind this principle. %$* 196
does the opposing team have a response to that? %$* 13
no? %$* 13
ma'am, your turn. %$* 13
norma ramos from the coalition against trafficking in women. %$* 10
my question i would like to have addressed by dr. %$* 10
farley and catharine mackinnon. %$* 10
we keep hearing that the solution is better regulation. %$* 10
i’d like you both to address what the real experiences are in the countries such as the netherlands and germany that are regulating the commercial sexual exploitation of women, which we at the coalition against trafficking in women refer to as the world’s oldest oppression. %$* 10
catharine mackinnon. %$* 13
yeah, germany is actually thinking about the swedish model at this point, having discovered that a tremendous amount of trafficking is produced by the draw of legalization. %$* 197
and that’s the same as in the netherlands, although they're not considering the swedish model at this point, but are looking to try to address the abuses that happen as a direct result of their legalization, across the board legalized initiatives. %$* 197
the other thing that happens in countries, for example, or in parts of countries like australia where you regulate it better, that is in the interest of trying to reduce the violence and the illness and other forms of abuses of the people, women in prostitution, you create a legal industry so you can regulate it well, that’s their whole attempt. %$* 197
what ends up happening, you know, apart from the fact that you can't put anything in the rooms like pillows because they're a lethal weapon, or sheets, because somebody might get tied down by them, so it’s a pretty bare prostitution experience. %$* 197
what happens is that the men who want to buy all the things that are abusive and dangerous and destructive to the women, in addition to the psychological, which remains the same, go to the ever-exploding illegal industry around it. %$* 197
right? %$* 197
so you legalize it in the name of having a well regulated prostitution industry, and exploding around it is the illegal industry for which there is no legal structure to address, for all the men who, to begin with, want to have sex without condoms. %$* 197
tyler cowen, your opponent, does that mean you're, you have been arguing that it can be regulated to safety and— %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
apparently he’s a lot smarter than, you know, several hundred years worth of other people who have tried to regulate and who have a million different ideas about how to do it. %$* 197
tyler cowen. %$* 13
i spoke at length about new zealand, there’s a several hundred page study about the experience which i have read. %$* 196
the other side has not uttered a peep about this, and even in the example of germany, it’s just been admitted, the real problem is the illegal trade, which in some way should be de-criminalized. %$* 196
the european model can be improved, but for the most part the western european model has worked better than what we do right here. %$* 196
this is widely understood throughout the world. %$* 196
melissa farley. %$* 13
i actually have read the new zealand report, and i also have studied prostitution in new zealand, and one of the things that happened in new zealand is what a maori community activist called an apartheid system of prostitution. %$* 195
in new zealand, the maori people are prostituted much younger and much longer, and they're more frequently homeless, so we again have that situation in new zealand of a special class of people who are more vulnerable— %$* 195
but melissa are, are you saying that regulation can never wipe out abuses, or do you just not like the idea anyway? %$* 13
well, let’s talk about the regulation. %$* 195
what happens in real life in new zealand, to stick with that for a moment, is that zoning is the sine qua non of regulation of prostitution. %$* 195
you mean where, where an establishment is, where it happens? %$* 13
the people who have a lot of money don’t want it in their backyards, so it’s zoned into the neighborhoods of poorer people, thereby increasing trafficking, johns, solicitations, and their general vulnerability to all aspects of the sex industry. %$* 195
this happened in new zealand, so— %$* 195
but the clarification i'm looking for is that— %$* 13
sorry. %$* 195
if tyler is right, and ultimately a system could be, of regulation could be developed to avoid the sorts of abuses that have been talking about, would that be okay with you? %$* 13
i, what %$* 195
here’s the answer to that %$* 195
it’s counter- intuitive. %$* 195
it’s been tried, and it didn't work. %$* 195
the mayor of amsterdam said, and i think this is true of many people, we thought it would work to regulate. %$* 195
well-intentioned people thought it would work to regulate, and it didn't. %$* 195
it actually, it’s very counter-intuitive. %$* 195
he said, what, they're shutting down over a third of the legal brothels in amsterdam right now. %$* 195
why? %$* 195
because eighty percent of the women in dutch legal prostitution are moved there from economically stricken europe, and because there’s organized crime that’s out of control. %$* 195
legalization is a pimp magnet, so i mean, that’s the answer. %$* 195
if we know that it doesn't work, it’s been tried, but— %$* 195
a, a quick, i— %$* 13
can i just respond to that, i— %$* 193
i was going to actually try to get the next question to go to you, how about that? %$* 13
i just wanted to know, i'm just— %$* 193
i guess not. %$* 13
no, i do. %$* 193
i just wanted to know, because i haven't heard the answer to this, on this point, if i may. %$* 193
if it’s a question of being badly regulated, then why do we see in the countries where it’s been legalized, we see that the trafficking has increased. %$* 193
nobody has addressed my point that nobody asks the ages of the girls when they pay for sex, and that’s the link between the trafficking. %$* 193
and no one has addressed that so far. %$* 193
from the, from the black please. %$* 13
gentleman? %$* 13
okay, this is for the women who say it’s wrong to pay for sex— %$* 9
let’s aim this towards one— %$* 13
first, just want to establish, fact, is it okay for you guys that a woman be a professional female masseuse and give massage therapy to a man. %$* 9
absolutely. %$* 193
okay. %$* 9
no problem with that. %$* 193
it is okay if a man goes to a particular masseuse because he finds her extremely attractive and is turned on by it, and only receives massage therapy? %$* 9
we’re talking slippery slope here, i think. %$* 13
i can see it getting slippery. %$* 193
that’s, so that’s okay? %$* 9
all right, third question, if during that process— %$* 9
not if the man were my husband. %$* 193
if during that  %$* 9
he has an orgasm, even though the woman didn't do anything out of the ordinary, did only professional massage therapy, is that okay? %$* 9
i don’t know, i mean, i think this is a kind of %$* 193
extreme example— %$* 193
this one has stymied %$* 13
i think what you're— %$* 193
i don’t think what— %$* 195
i think what you're trying to do with the question is collapse the distinction between human touch and the significance of sex. %$* 193
and i think sex is different and just because you're giving someone a massage, i mean, there’s nothing wrong with that. %$* 193
but i think that sexuality is something different, and you can always come up with an extreme example to collapse that distinction, but that just begs the question. %$* 193
okay, we are halfway through the direct head to head part of the debate. %$* 13
i want to remind you i'm john donvan, your moderator, and i want to now go to the other side of the table, lionel tiger, who argues against the motion, wants to pick up on that last point. %$* 13
well, first of all i, there’s a kind of a historical component to the other side. %$* 194
there’s a famous syndrome in turkey, rural turkey, the natasha. %$* 194
the natasha is a russian woman who goes to a small town in turkey and capsizes the entire system because she’s sexually available. %$* 194
now, the reason natasha is there is because the men in russia are drunk all the time, they have very low longevity, they are improper and not very useful husbands, the result is the birth rate in russia, which is plummeting, it’s a major crisis actually. %$* 194
but the reason for the natashas comes out of a really poignant human story. %$* 194
and i continue to feel that we’re losing not the nicety of the argument here, we’re losing the grandeur of the human issues that force some people into a small, intimate room, where they do something, and yes, it causes some people the distress that we’ve heard about. %$* 194
none of us on this side applauds that. %$* 194
at the same time, this is not exactly a trivial issue and i’m afraid it’s being reduced in its importance into a sentimental kind of grab bag of victim complaints— %$* 194
why sentimental. %$* 13
well %$* 194
because it’s easy. %$* 194
it’s all very—it’s easy in this country and everywhere else to talk about racial, class distinctions and so on. %$* 194
many of the clients of prostitutes i suspect, don’t have a great deal more money than the prostitutes, i don’t know. %$* 194
essentially what i’m trying to do here is, get the argument into the larger context of, of human sexuality, and away from a relatively, again sentimental concern. %$* 194
there was just—if i may make one final comment on this, there was recently the publication and we’ve known in the primatology trade about it for years, that it turns out that chimp males who hunt, will give meat to women who— %$* 194
to women? %$* 13
—will—if—a female— maybe. %$* 194
to female chimps, and the—but the fascinating thing is it’s not just a quid pro quo. %$* 194
because these become sustained and durable relationships, in which the male is a consort and an associate of the female, even when she’s not in estrus and therefore sexually available. %$* 194
and that is, it’s kind of haunting. %$* 194
because it suggests that, this is actually a more elegant phenomenon than just giving meat to a female. %$* 194
okay. %$* 13
uh— %$* 194
i see wendy shalit is quite anxious to come in on this. %$* 13
i’m— i have to admit i’m— %$* 193
wendy, can you just find your microphone— %$* 13
sure— %$* 193
thanks. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 193
i’m surprised by the negatives’ reliance on the argument that it’s not going away and historically, a lot of people have been doing it. %$* 193
we’re not debating whether it’s common, to pay for sex, we’re not debating whether it’s happened, we’re arguing whether it’s right or wrong. %$* 193
and, i think, i mean, if you bring up primatology, i’m just—i have to bring up, mr. %$* 193
tiger, your book which i really enjoyed the pursuit of pleasure which was a pleasure to read %$* 193
by the way, i must say. %$* 193
i found one example really interesting, you mentioned female genital mutilation. %$* 193
and you said what’s significant about female genital mutilation, is that men, males want sexual access to women, but they cannot bear it when other men have access to their mates. %$* 193
a common solution to the problem is the double standard, of which female genital mutilation you say is the extreme representation. %$* 193
here the effort is to try to control both sex and reproduction at once, by imposing strict controls on the sexuality of women. %$* 193
in an effort to prevent their wives’ impregnation by men other than themselves. %$* 193
now, i think we can always, you bring up chimps and primatology, we can explain yes female genital mutilation in terms of primatology but i hope we can all agree that that’s still wrong. %$* 193
and, just because— %$* 193
question from the right side— %$* 13
—just because the chimps can provide an explanation doesn’t mean that it’s right. %$* 193
the questioner is over on the far right here. %$* 13
my question is for mr. %$* 10
cowen. %$* 10
you made a distinction between toddlers who are prostituted and adults who are prostituted. %$* 10
sometimes, adults who are prostituted enter prostitution as toddlers or children. %$* 10
so— %$* 10
now, could you move the mic— %$* 13
yeah. %$* 10
thank you. %$* 13
my question to you is %$* 10
a simple one. %$* 10
is it okay to buy a 20-year- old woman, if that woman entered prostitution as a four-year-old, a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old. %$* 10
probably not. %$* 196
there are plenty of cases, as i am more than willing to admit, where what goes on, is wrong. %$* 196
but again, look at the resolution. %$* 196
the key point is that there are diverse practices, and multiple worlds. %$* 196
what you’re finding from the other side, is to take a woman in a difficult situation, choosing her best option. %$* 196
i’m saying, blame the difficult situation. %$* 196
they’re saying, blame the best option. %$* 196
it’s a very simple choice. %$* 196
which one are you going to blame. %$* 196
again i say blame the difficult situation. %$* 196
gentleman in the far left. %$* 13
hello, good evening. %$* 9
my name is i’m a professor of psychology at the new school for social research and i have a question for the panel in favor of the motion. %$* 9
when you were describing your prototypical prostitute, it came to mind for me, a prototypical coalmine worker. %$* 9
typically exploited for two or three generations, they had no other chance but going to the mines, and typically they suffer long-term mental and physical health consequences, consequences for their employment. %$* 9
and i suspect that you would make a difference between this and you would argue that they’re two different cases. %$* 9
and my—i suspect that your making difference on this would be based on disgust. %$* 9
and as many a philosopher of law have argued, and i agree with basic— %$* 9
i need you to get— i think we see where you’re going but i need you to get to a question. %$* 13
yes, so the question is where it is on disgust that you make this, this difference, and i would argue that this would not be appropriate, as many philosophers have argued, we should not, legislate on the base of disgust. %$* 9
we’re talking— %$* 195
melissa farley— %$* 13
—about the evidence of harm here, not a moral or emotional reaction. %$* 195
and the evidence of harm, i think the other side has just conceded the debate, if it’s wrong to prostitute someone who was a child when they entered prostitution, then what we know, and there’s no argument about these numbers, is that in the vicinity of 75 to 85 or 90 percent of everyone in prostitution, entered prostitution as a legal minor, oftentimes, a 13- or 14- year-old. %$* 195
that’s a fact. %$* 195
sydney barrows. %$* 13
when she says that’s a fact, you—that may be a fact with respect to the people who have been interviewed, but you have to remember, that the people who are interviewed for this sort of thing are a great minority, they are the ones that are in the most trouble, they’re the ones that end up, you know, being the most messed up. %$* 198
and so they’re the ones that these people get to talk to and to interview, and i’m not debating that these people have horrible problems. %$* 198
but to take a small minority and to apply their problems to the majority, is just— wrong. %$* 198
catharine mackinnon. %$* 13
this research has been very carefully designed so that they really are a representative sample of people at all levels, at all stages, at all class divisions, positions, in the industry. %$* 197
what’s being described by ms. %$* 197
barrows is research she doesn’t know. %$* 197
and, it %$* 197
what—and the ptsd rates don’t vary according to class level, is the other thing to remember. %$* 197
as to coalmine work and its negative consequences, what you describe is some people’s human rights are being violated through this work, that—in the way that it’s being done, in the coalmine industry. %$* 197
they have human rights and they need to be recognized. %$* 197
what we’re talking about is people whose human rights are being violated, and they need to be addressed. %$* 197
now as it happens, whenever someone else is selling you for sex, you are trafficked, and your human rights are being violated. %$* 197
the vast majority of people in the sex industry, somebody else is taking the pimp’s cut off their prostitution. %$* 197
and they’re do—and this is what is being bought when you’re buying sex, this is the reality of it, it is an industry of human rights violation. %$* 197
question from the top, please. %$* 13
we have criminal laws against child abuse, we have criminal laws against slavery, there are criminal laws that cover this kind of, of repression of human rights. %$* 10
now, as far as prostitution is concerned, if you take out the children that have been prostituted and the people who are held against their will, what you have is a contractual relationship. %$* 10
and %$* 10
i don’t see anything wrong with that. %$* 10
then what you have is at most 3 percent of the industry. %$* 197
is that what you’re defending? %$* 197
yeah, but i don’t know where you get that— why would an upscale call girl even bother to be interviewed. %$* 198
the people that you don’t hear from are the ones—what’s in it for them? %$* 198
they have no problem with it, they’re not about to go and bitch and complain that they’re being, you know, abused, when they’re perfectly happy about it, you only hear from the unhappy people. %$* 198
well, i don’t think that’s— %$* 197
one of the things— %$* 195
melissa farley— %$* 13
one of the things— %$* 195
research is done. %$* 197
one of the things— %$* 195
we don’t get to hear what your— %$* 198
melissa—melissa farley. %$* 13
one of the things researchers have attempted to do is to increase the numbers of people we interview in indoor prostitution. %$* 13
because it has been argued, and it has been my experience, that indoor prostitution and legal brothels and massage parlors and upscale call girl agencies, is often the—where the most harmed people are held, the most trafficked, the youngest. %$* 13
and so, you can’t make that assumption. %$* 13
researchers, not myself, another person in san francisco, and i’ve had this experience too, is that when we try to talk to pimps about interviewing their %$* 13
“girls,” we’re denied permission to speak with them. %$* 13
i don’t think it— %$* 198
syd—sydney, i’m, i’ve %$* 13
you’re rolling your eyes and i’d like to put some words behind that. %$* 13
i just %$* 198
this whole thing is just so absurd i wouldn’t even know where to start. %$* 198
i mean %$* 198
there is nothing in it for the girls who don’t have a problem with it to talk to these researchers, why would they bother. %$* 198
wendy— %$* 13
you don’t even know how many of them are out there— %$* 198
they don’t have a problem. %$* 193
wendy shalit? %$* 13
i don’t think it’s accurate to say that we haven’t heard from these high-end call girls, we have heard from them. %$* 193
for example in your book, ms. %$* 193
barrows, you talked about claudette, she’s the most empowered call girl, right, and she herself said this kind of work can be very taxing both physically and emotionally. %$* 193
“i’ve never met a man who can really understand what it takes out of you.” and i think that even the most supposedly empowered call girls when they are interviewed, do say thing— say things like this— %$* 193
but see you took that in a negative way. %$* 198
no, but— i think that— %$* 193
claudette loved— %$* 198
ladies and gentlemen— %$* 13
—being a call girl— %$* 198
—ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
so, we are now in the final stretch and soon you in our audience will be choosing the winner, and recall that at the start of the debate we asked you whether you took sides with or against the motion before us, which is, “it is wrong to pay for sex.” here are the results from your vote before the debate. %$* 13
20 percent of you were for the motion that it is wrong to pay for sex. %$* 13
50 percent were against, and, 30 percent were undecided, and we don’t have it on the graphic but i’ll share with you, that the for— in the “for” category, it was 2 to 1, women to men. %$* 13
in the “against” category, it was 3 to 2, men to women. %$* 13
and undecided was roughly equal. %$* 13
so, we’re gonna go to closing statements now, that’s round 3, and right after that, we will ask you to vote another time and remember we’re gonna end twice, once with the simple results and then, round of applause from all of you, and then we will share with you the breakdown by sex for those votes. %$* 13
so on to round 3, closing statements by each of the debaters, speaking first against the motion, lionel tiger, anthropology professor at rutgers university. %$* 13
you’re using my time. %$* 194
basically—i’ll have to repeat i’m afraid what i already said which is that, we have taken a subset of human behavior which we all disagree with and despise, which is coercive, which is as the speaker just before mentioned is covered by painfully wrought criminal law and so on, and we’ve turned that into a metaphor, and then a description of the common human experience that we all have of men and women or men and men or women and women together. %$* 194
and somehow, in the description we lose the generosity of spirit, the sense of adventure, the intensity, and, let us not forget, and not mentioning primates again, but sex is about human evolution, it’s about reproduction, it’s the most important thing any species has to attend to. %$* 194
and it would be a great surprise, if it were not confounded by glitches, sometimes tragic ones, it would be a great surprise if everyone was in agreement about it. %$* 194
we have, talking about prostitution, indian girls are betrothed at the age of four to a guy who’s five and they are married, but they obviously can’t perform as married couples until they reach a certain age. %$* 194
the kama sutra, that famous book that nobody’s ever been able to succeed in emulating, was given to the new couple when they finally were married so they could practice this great craft of sex. %$* 194
i’m, all i want to protect here, is the notion that sex is not a disease, that sexual interaction is not necessarily an expletive, exploitative phenomenon, that it has its own legitimacy, its own agenda, and it will and has continued, in much the same way and a sensible society will try to make it better— %$* 194
thank you— %$* 13
—not to criminalize it— %$* 194
thank you, lionel tiger. %$* 13
i wanna point out that in our closing round, each debater is given a brief amount of time, two minutes each, to make a closing statement and a final appeal for your vote and now, summarizing her position for the motion, wendy shalit, author of the good girl revolution: young rebels with self-esteem and high standards. %$* 13
thank you, i certainly agree that sex is not a disease, so i’m glad we can perhaps all agree on that %$* 193
look, nobody has addressed my point that, no one asks the ages of the girls, when they pay for sex, and that is the link between the trafficking of children, as well, and, so you wanna, i think, consider that, that’s something that nobody has addressed and it makes those paying for sex responsible. %$* 193
look, i think %$* 193
since the 1960s, we’ve been beholden to this false dichotomy that, you know, you’re either a repressed person who has no feelings, or the prudes, or you’re the liberated who goes around with everyone, and treats sex casually and i don’t think this dichotomy really captures the experience of most women or most men for that matter. %$* 193
and i think we need to revive the idea of higher standards for both sexes. %$* 193
and, that sex is a good thing, but we don’t have to take advantage of the most vulnerable in our society when we choose our sexual partners. %$* 193
the devaluing of women and children’s innocence that happens in a society that makes sex into a commodity, to validate that, and to declare that paying for sex is perfectly fine, is to say something about society’s relationship to women and especially girls that i think would be detrimental. %$* 193
but also to men. %$* 193
you’ve—yes, we’ve all read that times article about sugar daddies, but to me what was so touching was the man who went on the website, and he just gave the girl a monthly stipend for her education. %$* 193
and he refused to have sex with her and this is what the debate is about, it’s about who we want to be. %$* 193
and who knows the far-reaching consequences of that, that he went on this somewhat depressing website, but he was capable of such greatness and saying no, you know what, i’m not going to pay for sex. %$* 193
and, if you think that what the man did didn’t matter, that he supported her education without even meeting her, and you think he could’ve just as easily paid for sex, and that would’ve been the same choice morally then vote for the negative team, but if you can see the beauty in that choice, which he made in the privacy of his own home, and not in any courtroom, then, vote for the proposition— %$* 193
thank you— %$* 13
—because we’re not a monkey, men are not monkeys and women— %$* 193
thank you, wendy shalit— %$* 13
—women are not chicken. %$* 193
thank you. %$* 193
thank you. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, tyler cowen, economics professor at george mason university. %$* 13
rather than repeat my major points, i’d like to focus on one small answer. %$* 196
the issue came up, what if a man is a quadriplegic, and wants to buy sex. %$* 196
the opposition still hasn’t answered this question, in my opinion, their responses were, to put it bluntly, lame. %$* 196
women will come around, let’s teach women disability should not be a problem, that’s fine, no one will disagree with that. %$* 196
but what about, dot, dot, dot. %$* 196
there simply was no answer. %$* 196
the other side would’ve been much better simply saying look, that’s an exception to the principle, in that case it’s fine. %$* 196
but they cannot bring themselves to give that humane answer. %$* 196
i think when push comes to shove, there’s something about the notion of informed, consenting adults, which is what’s at stake here %$* 196
making an exchange that they simply do not like. %$* 196
if you’re in any doubt, just consider different parts of the world, and where they would line up in this debate. %$* 196
the notion that there are real abuses, but that buying sex is something that we should tolerate, is extremely common in western europe. %$* 196
the kinds of arguments you’re hearing on the other side. %$* 196
if you look at the debates over prostitution in the country of iran, you hear exactly, and i mean exactly the same arguments in iran, that you have heard from the people on the other side of this debate. %$* 196
if you look at what some aspects of what the religious right push for, the arguments they make, it is very similar to what you have heard on the other side of this debate. %$* 196
if you’re in any doubt, ask yourself, in which set of societies with which set of attitudes would you rather live. %$* 196
western europe, or the kinds of places and cultures, where the attitude toward prostitution is that which you find to my right. %$* 196
think about that, and then please vote accordingly. %$* 196
thank you. %$* 196
thank you, tyler cowen. %$* 13
summarizing her position for the motion, “it is wrong to pay for sex,” melissa farley, a psychologist and prostitution research and education. %$* 13
i think it’s wrong to pay for sex, there’s no mutuality of sexual pleasure or any other kind of power in prostitution, where one person has the social, legal, and economic power to buy another person, and to use them as a sexualized puppet. %$* 195
by the way one of the kinds of damages we haven’t talked about today, is the damage to women’s sexuality after being in prostitution for a long time. %$* 195
they usually are not capable of any kind of sexual intimacy, that reflects the years of selling that act in prostitution. %$* 195
they say, that’s stolen from them. %$* 195
men who are sold in prostitution experience exactly the same kinds of damage to their sexuality, and the similar symptoms of traumatic stress. %$* 195
maybe the primates we should take a lesson from, are the bonobos, who, when female bonobos are co-dominant, males are less aggressive and females are more sexual. %$* 195
there’s a lot of sexuality in bonobo society, everyone’s having sex. %$* 195
but it’s used for mutual pleasure, it’s used to cement social bonds. %$* 195
and by the way the first time a male—adolescent male gets sexually aggressive, the female elder bonobos get together and kick his ass. %$* 195
he— he learns from that one experience that that’s not what sex is. %$* 195
so, one other comment about legalization of prostitution, it really is a failed experiment, the same numbers of women in legal prostitution in nevada want to escape it, the same numbers are homeless, as in other kinds of prostitution. %$* 195
the institution of prostitution is built on the exploitation and abuse of women, it can’t be fixed, only abolished. %$* 195
i’m relentlessly optimistic about men’s capacity for change. %$* 195
it’s wrong to buy sex. %$* 195
thank you, melissa farley. %$* 13
summarizing her position against the motion, the mayflower madame, sydney biddle barrows. %$* 13
well, people have tried to legislate human nature and morality for centuries, and it’s never worked. %$* 198
it’d be great if it did, but it doesn’t. %$* 198
so we have to get real. %$* 198
now, it is true that, it’s %$* 198
when it comes to the younger girls, i think it’s tragic and i don’t understand why we are not absolutely prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law, men who want to have sex with a young girl—i mean i’m talking really young girls and children. %$* 198
so she goes up, she sees his etchings, and he has his way with her ‘cause she’s so drunk that she can’t practically say no, and then oh yes, oh sure, i’ll call you tomorrow, he never does %$* 198
she’s just been used. %$* 198
but a guy who thinks that a woman is worth it, he calls up and he says, i think that it’s worth $500 an hour, for me to pay to have sex with you, i think you’re worth it, i wanna give it to you, i don’t wanna pour $40 worth of drinks down your throat and steal it from you. %$* 198
i wanna give it to you. %$* 198
and so, i don’t think that there’s anything—i mean, you have a lot of very honest men out there, who pay for it because they feel it’s being more respectful. %$* 198
not for children, not for trafficked women, but there are huge amounts of men out there who pay for it because they believe it’s the right thing do, that it’s a fair exchange, and they want and they choose to do it, and we should—the women should be allowed to take the money. %$* 198
why not. %$* 198
thank you, sydney barrows. %$* 13
and our final speaker tonight, summarizing her position for the motion, “it is wrong to pay for sex,” catharine mackinnon, professor of law at the university of michigan. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 197
from the other side we’ve heard that paying for sex is old. %$* 197
that it’s diverse. %$* 197
that it’s natural. %$* 197
although i don’t think there are any pimps among chimps. %$* 197
that %$* 197
that there’s a global grandeur to human sexuality. %$* 197
and, also i think in essence that there’s nothing wrong with it if you get paid for it but you aren’t the one that has to do it. %$* 197
but we haven’t heard an argument about why it’s right. %$* 197
and little bit about why some aspects of it might not be wrong, entirely. %$* 197
but nobody’s really saying why it’s right. %$* 197
and to be on the cash nexus, with sex. %$* 197
when this gets, you know, pushed down to the fine edges of the slippery slope we essentially are having a, you know, if they get their way, what can we still have, department. %$* 197
and unesco, which is a united nations entity, has this to say about the relation of what we’ve been talking about, sexual victimization, and the economic exchange, they say, “sexual victimization”— this is a quote— “has been found to be the first step in the breakdown of a woman’s identity, which is necessary, to render the human body into a sexual commodity for economic exchange.” that’s i think what it is. %$* 197
it’s not only about—what that’s saying is, i think, is that what’s right about sex, is what paying for it violates. %$* 197
the hard issue i think for our side is, what to do when women aren’t paid for anything else. %$* 197
i’ve recently been working with 13-year-old girls who are the sole support of their families, an inter-generational caste-based prostitution in india. %$* 197
and they are the ones who are saying, not %$* 197
how can you take this one and only thing away from us that is the only thing that anyone will buy. %$* 197
they are the ones who are saying, give us any real option. %$* 197
this—our economic desperation that has put us in this position, is not all our lives can be. %$* 197
and, they’re saying, in mr. %$* 197
cowen’s terms, change the difficult situation. %$* 197
now, the other thing that is not being addressed by the other side is the question, why aren’t men being sold for sex. %$* 197
like by the millions worldwide in the same ways and in the same proportions women are, it seems me, that if being bought and sold for sex is part of the grandeur of human sexuality that men are really missing out on something here. %$* 197
thank you, catharine mackinnon. %$* 13
and that concludes round 3— %$* 13
women vote—women vote 1— %$* 197
clo—closing statements— %$* 13
—men vote 4. okay? %$* 197

does anybody need more time? %$* 13
okay, recall, in about three or four minutes we’ll have the results tabulated and we are going to announce them two different ways. %$* 13

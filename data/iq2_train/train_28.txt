if you are a twitterer, we would love to have you tweet during or after the debate. %$* 13
our handle is @iq2us. %$* 13
and the national constitution center's handle, constitutionctr. %$* 13
and the hash tag is speechdebate. %$* 13
now, what we always do at the beginnings of these faith debates is we have a little bit of a chat on stage to talk about how this topic came to be, why we're doing this one at this time, why it's actually phrased the way it is and why we're at, in this case, at the national constitution center. %$* 13
and for that reason i'd like to invite two gentlemen to the stage; nicholas quinn rosenkranz. %$* 13
he is professor of law at georgetown. %$* 13
he's a director of the rosenkranz foundation which initiated the intelligence squared u.s.debate series in 2006; and also jeffrey rosen. %$* 13
he is the president and chief executive officer of the national constitution center, and he's a professor at the george washington university law school. %$* 13
let's please welcome both to the stage. %$* 13
oh, you're here already. %$* 13
have a seat. %$* 13
so, jeffrey, tell us, you know-- %$* 13
you do a lot of debates, but you bring us in from time to time. %$* 13
and it's a great honor to us to get a little-- %$* 13
a little focus. %$* 13
and for us it's this focus on the fact that, as i was just explaining, we're really doing constitutional debate. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 49
first of all, i can't say how thrilled i am that iq2 is back at the national constitution center. %$* 49
nick and i had the idea last year of creating a special series of debates that focus, as you said, john, not on political issues, but on constitutional issues. %$* 49
people disagree firmly about politics. %$* 49
but when it comes to the constitution, we believe there are good arguments on both sides of the debates at the center of american politics. %$* 49
and people should educate themselves enough about those things to make up their own minds. %$* 49
so i was so excited by the first debate in our series: does the president have the power to constitutionally target and kill american citizens abroad? %$* 49
and i was impressed that although the audience initially voted, no, he doesn't have the power, after allen dershowitz gave the best closing argument i've ever heard-- %$* 49
it was amazing. %$* 13
they switched their vote and said yes. %$* 49
so i'm really struck by the fact that tonight you know that-- %$* 49
am i allowed to reveal the preliminary vote? %$* 49
i won't-- %$* 49
let's just â€“ %$* 49
oh, the online vote. %$* 13
the online vote-- %$* 49
yes. %$* 13
is overwhelmingly against the motion that individuals have an unlimited right to spend. %$* 49
but what i want you to do as an audience is listen to these debates not as a policy matter but as a constitutional matter; what does the first amendment allow or prohibit? %$* 49
and you're going to hear two prominent civil libertarian liberals who believe that the first amendment actually does not allow restrictions. %$* 49
so have an open mind, set aside your policy views, listen to the constitutional arguments. %$* 49
make up your own mind. %$* 49
and i cannot wait to hear the vote afterward. %$* 49
i am thrilled by this collaboration, and i'm so excited about tonight's debate. %$* 49
and nick you actually contributed to the language for this and worked on it quite specifically. %$* 13
and what's interesting is we're doing a debate in the fall in which you are enormously pithy. %$* 13
we're doing something on genetically modified food. %$* 13
and you said, well, let's have the motion be: "genetically modified food," three words. %$* 13
tonight our motion is 15 words, the longest we've ever had. %$* 13
why did it have to be that long? %$* 13
so our iq2 motions are usually very short and very punchy, and we go out of our way to have them-- %$* 67
have a sharp ring to them when we're on npr in particular. %$* 67
and-- %$* 67
but in constitutional law, every word matters. %$* 67
and constitutional doctrine often just doesn't lend itself to the three-word summary or the six-word summary. %$* 67
we sometimes need several words to really get at the concept you're trying to get at. %$* 67
and in this case, actually every word matters. %$* 67
so i would just urge the audience to have a really careful look at the resolution, the words that we chose. %$* 67
let me recite it. %$* 13
"individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech." %$* 13
so this may sound wordy or clumsy or something, but each word matters. %$* 67
so, for example, individuals and organizations, right, that's not just big corporations, but it might also be unions, could also be the new york times, might also be intelligence squared. %$* 67
have a right to unlimited spending, if not unlimited, then what are the limits? %$* 67
what are the constitutional limits? %$* 67
and on their own political speech, this is not-- %$* 67
we're not talking about donating money to someone else for their political speech. %$* 67
we're talking about you spending money on your political speech. %$* 67
and so each of these words matter to get at exactly the constitutional question here: are such limits consistent with the first amendment which was on the screen a moment ago, "congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." that's what we're here to debate tonight. %$* 67
and it's a pretty funny one, actually, and that's why it's such a good one. %$* 13
it's a great one. %$* 49
and as nick put it, we're not debating the issue about whether contributions to candidates can be limited. %$* 49
there are some principal first amendment advocates, both liberal and conservative, who think that limits on expenditures or contributions violate the first amendment. %$* 49
we didn't choose that motion because that's a rather high octane position. %$* 49
as nick put it, we rather carefully tailored the motion to be something that should be open to all of you, and i want you to think about it seriously. %$* 49
i do want to just give a shout-out to our great sponsors tonight. %$* 49
daniel burger and craig snyder, they're here-- %$* 49
talk about a civil libertarian, liberal libertarian conservative, they are on opposite sides of the political spectrum. %$* 49
but as craig put it to me before we started the show tonight, he said, "i am a tea bagger, and dan is a progressive of the worst sort, but we want to model civil discourse because we believe in the constitution." and i am thrilled. %$* 49
that's exactly what we're doing here. %$* 49
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, craig and dan. %$* 49
thank you, gentlemen down there, and thank you, gentlemen on the stage. %$* 13
and let's begin our debate and welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause to the national constitution center for bringing us here. %$* 13
it's a pleasure to be here. %$* 13
so look as all of the ways that americans can use their own money to give themselves a voice in politics. %$* 13
they can buy tv time, they can pay to get books written, they can put ads in the newspaper, they can put up yard signs. %$* 13
and here is the argument about that: it doesn't seem they're that people with the most money get to have the loudest voices. %$* 13
it seems like it would be corrupting. %$* 13
it seems un-american. %$* 13
but here is the counter argument. %$* 13
it doesn't seem fair to tell people how much of their own money they can spend to say what they want because that sounds like censorship, and that seems un-american. %$* 13
that sounds like it has the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are here at the national constitution center in philadelphia. %$* 13
we have two teams of two, superbly qualified all, arguing for and against the motion: individuals and organizations have a institutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
our debate, as always, goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
on the team arguing for the motion that individuals and organizations do have this constitutional right, please, let's welcome first floyd abrams. %$* 13
one of the most important first amendment lawyers, litigators in the country, you represented the new york times in the pentagon papers case, you represented senator mitch mcconnell in citizens united. %$* 13
in your book, which was called, "speaking freely," you said that when you were going to college in the mid-1950s, you were actually not that much of a first amendment supporter, so what actually changed your mind? %$* 13
i met some journalists. %$* 204
a time came in the late 1960s when i met a bunch of journalists. %$* 204
i was very impressed, almost awed by what they were doing, the skill with which they were doing it, and the national service that i thought they were doing by supporting the first amendment. %$* 204
we journalists aren't hearing that very much these days, so let me just say thank you. %$* 13
well, thank you, floyd abrams. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
and, floyd, who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner, i am very honored to be with one of the great civil liberties lawyers, and i mean this, in the country's history, nadine strossen. %$* 204
please welcome nadine strossen. %$* 13
nadine, you are also here to argue that individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own speech. %$* 13
you are a professor of law at new york law school, and you were president of the aclu, the nation's largest, oldest civil liberties organization, for 18 years, first woman, youngest to ever hold that position. %$* 13
now, on free speech, that organization, the aclu, has often found itself to be at odds with some of its seemingly natural allies; and on this one also, money and political speech, it seems that there is this split. %$* 13
so how difficult was it for you to stick to the first amendment side of this argument while, you know, facing your friends at the aclu? %$* 13
not at all difficult, i've been doing this since at least the late 1970s when the aclu controversially and successfully defended the free speech rights of nazis to march in skokie, illinois. %$* 51
i have enormous faith in free speech, and i love to try to spread that. %$* 51
so you are being consistent by being here tonight. %$* 13
yep, thank you. %$* 51
thank you, nadine strossen. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and now the team arguing against this motion that "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech," please let's first welcome burt neuborne. %$* 13
burt, you are one of the nation's foremost civil liberties lawyers. %$* 13
you're a professor at new york university's school of law. %$* 13
you're the founding legal director of the brennan center for justice, a former national legal director of the aclu, so, burt, almost sort of the same question, but the flipside, on most issues you would probably be on the other side of the stage here with your opponents. %$* 13
on this issue you disagree. %$* 13
so where are they getting it wrong? %$* 13
well, maybe they're not getting it wrong. %$* 205
this is an issue that divides the free speech community, and it's a very, very hard one. %$* 205
where i think they've gone wrong is that they're willing to tolerate the degree of inequality that uncontrolled spending brings into the democracy, and i think it destroys any notion of a truly egalitarian democracy. %$* 205
which sounds like we're getting into your opening statement, so i'm going to stop you right there. %$* 13
thanks very much, burt neuborne. %$* 13
and, burt, your teammate is? %$* 13
oh, my teammate is my colleague at fordham law school, zephyr teachout. %$* 205
ladies and gentlemen, zephyr teachout. %$* 13
zephyr, you are also arguing against the motion that "individuals and organizations have this constitutional right to" spend as much money as they want on speech-- %$* 13
political speech. %$* 13
you're a professor of law at fordham university. %$* 13
you were the first national director of the sunlight foundation. %$* 13
before that you were dabbling in politics. %$* 13
you made a name for yourself as director of online organizing for howard dean's 2004 presidential bid. %$* 13
you're an academic. %$* 13
but you're dabbling in politics again. %$* 13
you are running against andrew cuomo for governor of new york on the democratic ticket. %$* 13
what made you decide to get back into politics? %$* 13
well, i see in albany, new york, unfortunately, that money in politics has too much power. %$* 206
and it's really undermining the democracy of new york. %$* 206
also arguing and consistent from principle, ladies and gentlemen, zephyr teachout. %$* 13
so this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a competition of ideas well argued. %$* 13
and you are a live audience here in philadelphia. %$* 13
the national constitutional center will be our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate is ended, you will have voted twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
in our debates it's the team whose numbers have changed the most between the opening and closing votes who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary votes. %$* 13
each of you has a keypad at your seat. %$* 13
it's on the right hand side. %$* 13
and what i want you to do is just pay attention only to the numbers one, two, and three. %$* 13
the other numbers are not live. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, "individuals and unlimited spending, in-- %$* 13
on their own political speech, push #1.if you disagree with it, push #2.and if you're undecided, push #3.and if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will lock in your last vote just before we lock out everything. %$* 13
and it looks like everybody-- %$* 13
i have eye contact from everybody. %$* 13
so, well done. %$* 13
so, let's go on to round 1.round 1, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be six minutes each. %$* 13
up first, arguing for the motion, individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending of the-- %$* 13
let me do this again. %$* 13
up first, for the motion, individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech-- %$* 13
nadine strossen. %$* 13
she is a professor of law at new york law school and former president of the american civil liberties union. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nadine strossen. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 51
thank you. %$* 51
i'm delighted to be here at the national constitution center defending a proposition that is supported by the constitution's grand opening words. %$* 51
you all know them. %$* 51
"we the people." as those words underscore, we individuals are sovereign. %$* 51
therefore, we have no right more essential than the right to engage in our own political speech-- %$* 51
speech about public affairs, speech about political campaigns. %$* 51
as the supreme court put it, speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression. %$* 51
it is the essence of self-government. %$* 51
especially essential is our right to criticize candidates, officials, and policies. %$* 51
therefore, it's hard to imagine a greater violation of our precious free speech rights than for the government-- %$* 51
in other words, incumbent officials-- %$* 51
to limit our right to criticize them and their policies or to limit our right to advocate alternatives. %$* 51
it's likewise anathema for government to limit our right to band together with other like-minded individuals to amplify our voices. %$* 51
the supreme court first so held in landmark cases from the civil rights area involving the naacp, which was a corporation. %$* 51
and from them, what i've said so far, individuals and our organizations clearly have a constitutional right to unlimited political speech. %$* 51
so, that means there's only one aspect of tonight's resolution that's really at issue. %$* 51
and that is whether we also have a constitutional right to unlimited spending in support of our political speech. %$* 51
but logically, the answer to that question clearly has to be yes, because unlimited spending is a pre-requisite for unlimited speech. %$* 51
when the government limits how much we may spend on our speech, it necessarily limits the speech itself, in quantity and or quality. %$* 51
think about it. %$* 51
suppose the government imposed maximum spending limits on iq squared or on the national constitution center or-- %$* 51
dare i say, on the brennan center for justice? %$* 51
all of which are corporations, by the way. %$* 51
those spending limits would clearly limit the amount that could be said by any of those fine organizations. %$* 51
every communication requires some spending. %$* 51
and since costly tv ads are so important in election campaigns, you have to spend a lot to reach a critical mass of the voters. %$* 51
so, for government to limit what we may spend on our own political speech, including our criticism and our dissent, is for the government to limit our criticism and dissent. %$* 51
and that violates not only the rights of all of us dissidents, but also the rights of everyone to hear us. %$* 51
that point was well-made back in 1957 by three of the greatest, most liberal egalitarian justices ever to grace the supreme court bench-- %$* 51
chief justice earl warren, hugo black, and william o.douglas. %$* 51
they were reviewing the very first federal law to limit spending on political speech. %$* 51
it banned such spending by corporations, and by labor unions on a rationale that we continue to hear, including from our esteemed opponents tonight, namely that these organizations are so rich and so powerful that they could be unduly influential. %$* 51
they could drown out others. %$* 51
but these justices resoundingly rejected that rationale as anti-democratic. %$* 51
as they explained it is we the people who are sovereign. %$* 51
it is there are vitally important that we the people have access to every view of every group in the community. %$* 51
after all, if there are any groups that are disproportionately powerful in the political process, it's the constitutional media with their unique impact on public opinion. %$* 51
yet we wouldn't even dream of letting the government limit what even the most powerful media company could spend on its political views. %$* 51
even those who want to limit what the rest of us spend draw the line at the media even when they're part of conglomerates. %$* 51
but since media moguls have the right to unlimited spending on their political speech, surely it follows that the rest of us must have the very same right, otherwise it unfairly amplifies the voices of the rich and powerful people in groups who can afford to buy a media outlet. %$* 51
so that's just one of the reasons why spending limits actually undermine their stated goal, namely of leveling the playing field. %$* 51
another reason is that spending limits favor incumbents and the two major particular parties, which should hardly surprise us because after all it's the incumbents who pass these laws. %$* 51
now, our opponents are going to argue, and they already have, that these limits promote equality and integrity in our political system. %$* 51
certainly these are extremely worthy goals. %$* 51
but as i've already noted, the goals are not in fact served. %$* 51
they are underserved by spending limits as floyd will amplify on that further. %$* 51
for these reasons, please vote yes on the motion for unlimited political speech and therefore the unlimited spending that facilitates it and against government limits on what we the people may say and hear about it. %$* 51
thank you, nadine strossen-- %$* 13
who finished with three seconds to spare. %$* 13
that was masterful. %$* 13
our motion is "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech." and here to debate against this motion, burt neuborne. %$* 13
he is the milholland professor of civil liberties and the founding legal director of the brennan center for justice at new york university school of law. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, burt neuborne. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 205
i too am delighted to be at the national constitutional center. %$* 205
i too care about we the people. %$* 205
i like to think i care about we, all the people, not just the people that have enough money to be able to engage in the kind of speech that occurs when you have utterly unlimited amounts of spending. %$* 205
we can't consider this in a vacuum. %$* 205
we have to look at facts. %$* 205
we can't think about this in a bubble. %$* 205
in the last election cycle, $6 billion we spent on campaigning. %$* 205
of that $6 billion, almost 99 percent came from 1 percent of the population with the capacity to spend enough money to be able to bring their views into powerful play in the electoral process. %$* 205
of that, 1/10 of 1 percent contributed vast amounts, about $6 billion, many of it unreported because of loopholes in the discovery laws. %$* 205
and of that 569 billionaires maxed out in a way in which they contributed vast sums and spent vast sums in impressing the rest of us with their views. %$* 205
now, that means a small group of americans, super citizens, i call them, has the ability to decide who gets to run for office because there's a wealth primary. %$* 205
unless you can convince the rich to support you, you cannot run for office. %$* 205
they have a disproportionate effect on who wins because they can control the speech patterns in ways that allow them to speak to the community in an effective way even though their opponents may not be able to do so. %$* 205
and they control what we see and hear because they set the agenda because if they don't agree, then they simply don't support the candidate in the first place. %$* 205
now, every election is turned into a one dollar, one vote election unless there are some restrictions, some restrictions on what people can spend in asserting their own views. %$* 205
now, it doesn't have to be this way. %$* 205
it's correct for us to talk about constitutional law. %$* 205
what does the first amendment actually say about the proposition that we're talking about tonight? %$* 205
it says congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. %$* 205
we can't read it literally because that would mean only congress would be president, not the governor, not the cop on the beat. %$* 205
so we don't-- %$* 205
we can't read it literally. %$* 205
and then it says, "shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech," not abridging speech, but abridging the freedom of speech. %$* 205
some human being must make a judgment about what goes in that protected category and what does not. %$* 205
so what fundamental mistakes have we made in saying that the freedom of speech gives the richest 1/10 of 1 percent of this country the capacity to dominate a democracy that is supposed to be one person, one vote? %$* 205
first, the-- %$* 205
we said that equality doesn't matter, that trying to equalize the rough ability of all of us to affect the political process is not an adequate basis for justifying limits, not saying that you can't spend anything, not saying that you can't even spend a lot, but saying that there is absolutely no limit. %$* 205
the sky is the limit on what you can spend. %$* 205
and if you have a regime like that, forget about any idea of equal political participation because it's a fiction. %$* 205
secondly, the idea that spending money at astronomical levels, it equals speech instead of power i think is a fiction. %$* 205
when you start spending money above a hundred thousand, 200,000, 500,000, a million, 5 million, to push your ideas into the public, at some point you have got a loudspeaker that is louder than anybody else's. %$* 205
and everybody, i think, would say that the volume of the speech is not the same thing as the speech so that there has to be some limit on the up side or else forget about any idea of egalitarian democracy. %$* 205
and we don't have to say that speech equals-- %$* 205
that money equals speech. %$* 205
that was a mistake we made in 1976, and we can fix it. %$* 205
third, the idea that corporations, profit making corporations-- %$* 205
and we have to distinguish here between nonprofit corporations that are essentially just a group of people that gather together to advance their politics in a corporate form and corporations like citicorp or pharmaceuticals or the oil companies that are essentially collections of individuals designed to sell things for a profit where the money comes from investors, it comes from consumers, and it comes from shareholders. %$* 205
why should the management of those companies that assemble vast amounts of money in connection with their commercial activity-- %$* 205
why should the managements of those companies be able to tap that money to advance their own political views in the give and take of an election? %$* 205
we made it much worse in 2010 when we took a system that said, very rich people could do that, and we parachuted in on top of it. %$* 205
large corporations, profit making corporations without any attempt at distinguishing between a small corporation, a membership corporation like the naacp or the brennan center or the aclu, which is not in it for profit, and which has people that share their views and a huge corporation like general motors. %$* 205
burt neuborne, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
and thank you very much. %$* 13
and here is a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over there motion: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech."you have heard of the first two debaters and now onto the third. %$* 13
at the lecturn, floyd abrams, he is a partner at cahill, gordon and reindel, and he represented senator mitch mcconnell in citizens united versus federal election commission. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, floyd abrams. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 204
i want to start with a point that nadine made, which i don't think was responded to, and that is that without the ability to spend money, we don't have political speech, at least we don't have enough political speech to have a chance to win most elections. %$* 204
look around this room. %$* 204
imagine that this was not the national constitution center but a political hall, but otherwise just the same, with all you people here. %$* 204
we couldn't have this event, we couldn't have a debate without paying for the lights, the microphones, the cameras, everything in the room. %$* 204
there are people here, i want to assure you not the speakers, who are being here tonight. %$* 204
and none of this could occur if people didn't spend money to back it up, to make it happen, to allow it to happen. %$* 204
now, burt talked about-- %$* 204
he used the phrase about "one man, one vote." we have never ever lived in a system of one speech, one person, or limited speech per person. %$* 204
we don't say that. %$* 204
we wouldn't imagine saying that to our newspapers or our media entities, however large they are. %$* 204
if you were to take burt's point literally, you would say, "it is-- %$* 204
we cannot persist in the notion that rupert murdoch can have all the money and power he has," or that the philadelphia inquirer could have all the power that at least it once had in philadelphia and that it certainly does to a significant degree today. %$* 204
it's perfectly true to say that people with money have more influence and power than people who don't. %$* 204
that's the way of the world. %$* 204
how do we deal with that? %$* 204
we can deal with equality as best we can as a public. %$* 204
we can have laws. %$* 204
some of them we have already. %$* 204
we can have better laws about people being able to vote instead of closing polls early in the day. %$* 204
we can limit the money if that's what we're after. %$* 204
we can have higher taxes. %$* 204
i'm not advocating anything today. %$* 204
i'm just saying it doesn't violate the first amendment to have a wealth tax. %$* 204
it doesn't violate the first amendment to crack down on banks. %$* 204
it doesn't violate the first amendment to have tougher antitrust laws. %$* 204
it does violate the first amendment to limit speech. %$* 204
and that is what the negative side of this proposition necessarily is urging on you. %$* 204
indeed, burt did it. %$* 204
he is always straightforward. %$* 204
he was straightforward tonight. %$* 204
what is the argument? %$* 204
too few people have too much power. %$* 204
and, therefore, what? %$* 204
they should not be allowed to speak as much as their money might allow, or, to put it differently, because they have more money and are prepared to spend it on political speech, our congress, the very people who as nadine pointed out have the most direct personal interest in passing legislation which will keep them in power-- %$* 204
that the congress can pass constitutional legislation limiting the amount of their speech. %$* 204
the supreme court put it very well in 1976 in the buckley case referred to by burt. %$* 204
i want to read you one line. %$* 204
the court said, "the concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements in our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment." that's what the court said. %$* 204
that's what the law is right now. %$* 204
and i think it is a glorious articulation of first amendment principle. %$* 204
and these were not the five supposedly rabid rightwing conservatives who gave us citizens united. %$* 204
this was justice brennan, this was justice thurgood marshall, this was justice potter stewart, three of the most stalwart defenders of the first amendment in our history. %$* 204
and what they were saying is, "you can deal with problems in a lot of ways, you can deal with the equality problem in lots of ways, but the one way you can't deal with it is by shutting up the voices of others or limiting the voices of others, wholly foreign to the first amendment." this is one of the things that makes us so special in the world. %$* 204
i mean, it's only we, and we should be proud of it, but only we have a first amendment as strong, as totally controlling over what congress can do as we do. %$* 204
so i would urge on you that while to some degree i understand that it seems not fair that people who have more money should have more power, if you want to deal with it, and we should sometimes, if you want to deal with that, don't deal with speech. %$* 204
one of the first amendment principles that's first is hurt speech last. %$* 204
so, i urge you to vote yes on this resolution. %$* 204
thank you. %$* 13
floyd abrams. %$* 13
and the resolution is this: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
and here to argue against this motion-- %$* 13
zephyr teachout. %$* 13
she is an associate professor of law at fordham law school and a former national director of the sunlight foundation. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, zephyr teachout. %$* 13
thank you so much. %$* 206
i want to point out, first of all, that my worthy opponents both relied heavily on arguments about limiting the press from speaking. %$* 206
that's an interesting debate, but that is not the debate we are having tonight. %$* 206
there is a separate clause in the constitution, a freedom of the press clause, which is put in there to protect especially particular kinds of institutions that play particular roles in our democracy. %$* 206
what i do think we are debating is we're having a debate about reality and we're having a debate about history. %$* 206
both of my opponents, very persuasively argue, but i would argue they mostly argue from abstraction. %$* 206
burt started his argument talking about money and how it actually influences politics. %$* 206
and i want to talk about history, because i think this is a constitutional debate in the most fundamental sense. %$* 206
it's about who we are, how we want to constitute ourselves, and what our most fundamental principles are. %$* 206
so, instead of starting with a text of the first amendment, sort of separated from its own purpose and principles, i want to return to the constitutional convention across the street, 230 years ago and look at the core purposes of the constitution itself, because only once we really understand the constitution and what it is for, and what it was for, can we understand the place of the first amendment in it. %$* 206
i've spent a lot of time reading the transcripts of the debates of the constitutional convention. %$* 206
and i'll tell you, there's one fear-- %$* 206
the core principle is representative democracy. %$* 206
figuring out a system where the public good could be represented. %$* 206
it's a really difficult puzzle. %$* 206
and there's one fear that dominated over every fear, and that was the fear of corruption. %$* 206
they talked about corruption more often than they talked about violence, more often than they talked about the threat of faction, more often than they even talked about this-- %$* 206
current problems of the day. %$* 206
the threat was that this beautiful new country would fall victim to the power of money to distract representatives from their job to tend to the public good, the same way that they had seen britain do. %$* 206
pierce butler said, "look at britain. %$* 206
you know, there we've built the fairest society ever. %$* 206
and yet, corruption has destroyed that fabric." so, they weren't worried about some technical question of non-representative democracy. %$* 206
they were worried about how money-- %$* 206
in all these different guises-- %$* 206
could come in and take away this sort of precious young country. %$* 206
at the time, the concerns were focused around gifts from kings-- %$* 206
the king of france kept giving these really luxurious snuff boxes to diplomats. %$* 206
and there was a lot of anxiety that that would lead people like benjamin franklin to forget that his obligation was to this country and not to france. %$* 206
another major concern was that people would go into office in order to get good jobs later-- %$* 206
or at the same time. %$* 206
butler also said, "a man takes a seat to get an office for himself, for his friends. %$* 206
this is the source from which flows venality and corruption." if you look at the constitution, there's not just the first amendment when it comes to money and politics. %$* 206
there's dozens of clauses. %$* 206
and each of these clauses is communicating that what the founders cared about was protecting against this thing which is the danger to all republics. %$* 206
so, when alexander hamilton was asked, "what were you doing at the convention? %$* 206
" he said, you know, "our job was to protect against - - but to create every practicable obstacle against corruption." and mason said, "if we do not provide against corruption, we will soon be at an end."for the next 200 years in this-- %$* 206
courts understood that protecting against corruption was one of the core jobs of law itself. %$* 206
and so you would never see a lobbying case, lobbying was illegal in this country for a long time-- %$* 206
a lobbying case or a money in politics case without a serious investigation about-- %$* 206
of whether the laws that issue-- %$* 206
or the structures that issue might lead representatives to forget their obligations to the public and instead serve other masters. %$* 206
200 years after 1776, in 1976, you saw courts starting to forget that. %$* 206
i'm not going to go into the full history here, but my objection to the proposition is not what's in it, it's what's not in it. %$* 206
if you can't talk about the first amendment without also talking about why it's there and without also talking about the ways in which it might lead to money taking over this extremely precious and rare thing, which is representative democracy. %$* 206
so starting in 1976, the character of money in politics has gradually dwindled and become smaller and smaller in all our court cases until recently, in citizens united and mccutcheon vs. %$* 206
fec where the great tradition of the first amendment is weighed against basically a corruption which the justices call the same as bribery law instead of the old corruption that our founders understood. %$* 206
so i urge you to reject this proposition because so much is at stake; representative democracy itself. %$* 206
thank you, zephyr teachout, your time is up. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is, "individuals and organizations have a institutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech."keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening. %$* 13
again, we're going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments. %$* 13
and it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now we go on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
we have, in this second round two teams of two debating this motion: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
you've heard the arguments for this motion from floyd abrams and nadine strossen. %$* 13
they have argued that, yes, very likely the fact that the rich would have more of a voice in a marketplace where there's no limb mitts to spending, they would have that louder voice, and that's a real problem. %$* 13
but they say the solution cannot be the limiting of what they spend on that voice because that runs right into something called the first amendment. %$* 13
they say if anything, that amendment was conceived to protect political speech which is the essence of self-government. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, burt neuborne and zephyr teachout, they are saying that there can and should be limits on spending for speech in politics because they're arguing that spending is more than just speech. %$* 13
it's actually action. %$* 13
it's the accumulation of power and that this has consequences, particularly when the source of that power, the source of that money is large corporations driven by their own profits. %$* 13
they also make a philosophical argument that whatever the text of the first amendment they say that there are values that fight corruption embedded in the constitution's history and its own philosophy and that those also have standing in this debate. %$* 13
i want to go to the team that is arguing against the motion. %$* 13
you're arguing-- %$* 13
in other words, you're arguing for the government being able to limit speech, to limit the spending on speech. %$* 13
and as i said, you're opponents are saying the first amendment is your problem on this argument. %$* 13
and your response to this is what? %$* 13
is it that the first amendment is not a problem to this argument, that the first amendment is irrelevant, or is it that it's a problem that can be worked with? %$* 13
burt neuborne. %$* 13
well, the first amendment is the central thing we have to think about. %$* 205
it is the text that the constitution has that gives us the answer. %$* 205
but the answer is not self-evident in the first amendment. %$* 205
it's not as though god spoke from the mountaintop, and we know that the first amendment says that unlimited spending is protected under the first amendment. %$* 205
the text itself doesn't say so. %$* 205
our history for 200 years doesn't say so. %$* 205
the constitutional convention doesn't say so. %$* 205
and representative democracy doesn't say so. %$* 205
so it's not that the first amendment-- %$* 205
it's not that we have to get around the first amendment. %$* 205
it's that they're misreading the first amendment. %$* 205
read directly, the first amendment is democracy's best friend. %$* 205
and they are reading it as a kind of conspiracy to destroy it, and therefore-- %$* 205
whoa, whoa. %$* 13
that's-- %$* 13
we apparently have very different views of democracy and-- %$* 51
nadine strossen. %$* 13

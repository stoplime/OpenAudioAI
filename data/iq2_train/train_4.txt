is that not meaningful? %$* 13
i would say it’s nice, but at the end of the day, the moderates need to know that we are going to stand with them and exactly what has barack obama indicated in terms of what political capital and what resources america will expend to stand with these moderates? %$* 142
you had an opportunity in iran. %$* 142
it was a bona fide dissident movement, almost one year ago today. %$* 142
they were saying, where is america? %$* 142
throughout modern histories, you know bernard, because you’ve been very active on these human rights issues. %$* 142
america’s leaders and american presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements, whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in south africa; whether it was the soviets dissident movement in the former soviet union, the oxygen for these movements is america keeping a spotlight on it. %$* 142
our president was silent. %$* 142
in the first place, the inspiration for a lot of that movement came from the words of barack obama and his symbolism. %$* 143
secondly-- %$* 143
secondly, i think it's very interesting that you want to ask what's the benefit of a speech because one of the things that we should be talking about is concrete policies and specific actions. %$* 143
one of the things we did learn during the previous administration was that harsh rhetoric doesn't help. %$* 143
strong bull-headed rhetoric appeals to americans, but it doesn't change foreign affairs. %$* 143
it's what ahmadinejad wants. %$* 143
it helps him consolidate his grip on power when we call him names. %$* 143
so barack obama played a very clever strategy in that. %$* 143
it didn't work, but no-- %$* 143
you can't-- %$* 143
america, i'm sorry. %$* 143
even though i know that i would like to believe that america could cause a revolt inside iran, we have been talking about a change in regime through six administrations, and it hasn't happened in iran yet. %$* 143
and so i don't think it's a legitimate criticism to say that barack obama gave a speech and the iranian revolt against the ahmadinejad didn't work. %$* 143
i mean that's not cause and effect. %$* 143
but what is a demonstration of barack obama's strength is his staying with his commitment in iraq. %$* 143
it is reinforcing in afghanistan. %$* 143
and there is not a leader in the world who would look at barack obama and say he made an easy decision on that. %$* 143
he did not pander to the american public. %$* 143
and those of you in this audience, i bet if you took a vote on that, the majority of this audience would not have supported him when he put those extra troops into afghanistan, and yet that was the right call and it was a tough call. %$* 143
and he is recognized around the world for his courage in making that call. %$* 143
i, too, have talked to foreign leaders, and mort, that's what they tell me. %$* 143
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
well, again, i hate to say this, but i think you're speaking only to foreign leaders who speak with a french accent. %$* 144
i don't know what else to tell you. %$* 144
no, that's an unfair comment. %$* 144
look. %$* 144
let me just say that. %$* 144
the one area of the world where we have to worry about is frankly the middle east. %$* 144
and there you have, i think, a couple of countries, and a couple of movements that are really threatening a lot of our allies, iran being one. %$* 144
the movements in hezbollah and hamas, basically terrorist groups of that sort. %$* 144
for syria to have just provided scud missiles or their equivalent to hezbollah is changing the whole military context of the region. %$* 144
nothing is stopping these people. %$* 144
and i don't dismiss entirely the rhetoric of the president. %$* 144
i'm just saying that in that part of the world you need a lot more than rhetoric. %$* 144
i don't want to diminish what the value of rhetoric is. %$* 144
but you have to translate that into other policies that really do have an effect against the people who are threatening. %$* 144
wesley clark just talked about a concrete move of putting more troops into afghanistan. %$* 13
that wasn't rhetoric. %$* 13
i don't disagree with that. %$* 144
i mean i wasn't referring at that point-- %$* 144
at that point, we were in a position in afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between afghanistan and pakistan as we all know. %$* 144
if there was a rationale for going into afghanistan, it is to make sure that pakistan does not collapse. %$* 144
because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands. %$* 144
so in a sense, we are protecting pakistan and all of that. %$* 144
so i don't diminish that. %$* 144
i'm not saying that everything he's done is wrong. %$* 144
i'm just saying that when you play this game out there, and it is, in a sense, an understanding of how to work in that community, i'm afraid that the rhetoric that is being saluted here is not nearly as effective as you would say and the policies that would be effective are simple not being carried out. %$* 144
our motion is “obama's foreign policy spells america's decline,” and in arguing for this motion, are you saying that decline has begun already, we're in it? %$* 13
dan senor. %$* 13
i think the prospect of decline is real. %$* 142
we are in an early stage of it. %$* 142
what is the-- %$* 13
and it can be arrested. %$* 142
as general clark and bernard said-- %$* 142
general clark in his opening statement said that america was in decline when obama took over, that we were in a deep hole. %$* 142
then you're arguing that we're already in decline. %$* 142
and the question is now is obama slowing it down? %$* 142
and i would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell american decline because we can't do this on our own. %$* 142
and i want to ask a question. %$* 142
you know, i agree with you that george w. bush was extremely-- %$* 142
i'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world. %$* 142
he got much bigger crowds opposing him traveling around the world than barack obama gets supporting him. %$* 142
but one thing president bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders, aznar in spain, harper in canada, howard in australia, blair in the u.k., sharon in israel. %$* 142
and putin in russia. %$* 143
hold on. %$* 142
hold on. %$* 142
and that was an enormous mistake. %$* 142
and by the way, he basically stood by georgia when georgia went to war with russia because of russia's provocation. %$* 142
so that was a big mistake by bush, and i'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to russia. %$* 142
but you look at these leaders. %$* 142
blair, berlusconi, howard, harper-- %$* 142
these leaders stood by bush through thick and thin, even though their populations despised him. %$* 142
i ask you to-- %$* 142
tell me one leader today that has that kind of relationship with obama. %$* 142
one leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that pakistan has terrorists in it, point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance. %$* 142
just one. %$* 142
i think it is because of my french accent that you did not get what i said. %$* 145
i suppose. %$* 145
so i will repeat. %$* 145
the characteristic of the period where we are is that berlusconi, zapatero, and even sarkozy might be less important today than the peoples, than the masses, the huge crowds who all over the world were fed by your rubbish anti- americanism for ages, and who are slightly changing their mind. %$* 145
maybe sarkozy said that barack obama is naive, but-- %$* 145
he made – sarkozy is not so important. %$* 145
more important than sarkozy is that you have, as you know, an annual poll judging the big leaders of the world. %$* 145
and barack obama, the last poll two months ago arrive at 46 or 48-- %$* 145
those polls don't make policy. %$* 142
governments make policy. %$* 142
there is not a single government? %$* 142
that's very nice. %$* 142
they applaud for him-- %$* 142
tell me one leader. %$* 142
one leader. %$* 142
history is not made by berlusconi. %$* 145
real people, suffering people, losing their houses, suffering from terrorism, being fed up by fanaticism: this is a real actor of history. %$* 145
and in front of these people barack obama is much more popular than has been your-- %$* 145
i think the question you're asking, dan, is a naive question. %$* 143
i'll tell you why. %$* 143
the inner sarkozy in you. %$* 142
because if you believe that leaders stand by the united states because of some personal relationship with the president, then you're neglecting the whole political basis for their own mandate in their own country. %$* 143
so if you scratch-- %$* 143
if you scratch-- %$* 143
if you could scratch very deeply on someone like prime minister blair, and no one has managed to scratch very deeply on him yet, he would tell you that he was trapped by his early support of the bush administration in iraq. %$* 143
he has defended it and defended and defended it because that's what political leaders do. %$* 143
but if you talk to the people who were around him at the time, and were there, and all of a sudden we jumped in without a second un security council resolution, he thought he could influence president bush the way he could influence president clinton. %$* 143
he signed up on his team, he jumped in there and it turned out there was no influence at all. %$* 143
but political leaders act for their own survival. %$* 143
that's what motivates political leaders. %$* 143
berlusconi, blair-- %$* 143
all those people saw they had to hang on to the commitments and the statements they had previously made. %$* 143
they couldn't back away from them, not because of their great respect for an american president but because of their own domestic politics. %$* 143
put this in terms of obama’s presidency in two sentences; its relevance. %$* 13
he’s going to make smart policy decisions. %$* 143
he’s going to bring the people of the world with him. %$* 143
he’s going to moderate the domestic opponents around the world of our policies. %$* 143
he’s going to make it easier for foreign leaders to agree with and support us. %$* 143
so dan, you need a shot back. %$* 13
these have been two arguments against your point that the personal relationships are critical. %$* 13
yeah, i want to be clear here. %$* 142
it is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation. %$* 142
in fact, several of the leaders i cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the united states under president bush. %$* 142
two: security matters. %$* 142
probably security matters and i have a slightly less cynical view; security matters to these leaders, in many cases more than politics. %$* 142
and it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with president bush. %$* 142
i’m sorry if my american accent, i wasn’t able to make my point clear. %$* 142
their sense of loyalty to president bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad. %$* 142
and those leaders were willing to go the mat even if it meant risking their political careers to stand with him. %$* 142
you say tony blair was trapped. %$* 142
to this day, tony blair is out of office. %$* 142
to this day, he defends the decisions he made. %$* 142
so i come back to you, you say policy makers don’t matter when it comes to policy? %$* 142
i mean that’s the most inverted metric i’ve ever heard. %$* 142
policy makers make policy, and i don’t see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for president obama, which i think is heartfelt; i don’t see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president. %$* 142
and i-- %$* 142
i think if they believed he was committed to them, that you’d have a different outcome. %$* 142
i want to move on to some other topics. %$* 13
bernard, i want to move on to some other topics. %$* 13
this may go on forever and i do want to move on. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
and i say that with respect, but it’s beginning to circle. %$* 13
i want to go to the audience for some questions. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, we’ll bring up the lights a little bit more so perhaps i can see. %$* 13
but before we do that, i just want to go to a specific example to put this in more concrete terms and i would like to talk about china. %$* 13
dan senor, take on the president’s performance in china. %$* 13
it was stunning. %$* 142
i’ve never heard such unanimous criticism of a president’s visit to china from across the political spectrum from the left and the right in the united states. %$* 142
it was a humiliating experience. %$* 142
the chinese were allowed to censor his speech on the ground. %$* 142
the chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech. %$* 142
students as you know, many students were kept out and he left china with no concessions from the chinese. %$* 142
normally when presidents go, even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president, they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with. %$* 142
we didn’t get anything. %$* 142
here we are today, iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and china still won’t support sanctions on the u.n.security council, still won’t support sanctions. %$* 142
by the way they won’t support sanctions in sudan; they won’t support sanctions anywhere. %$* 142
so, i keep coming back to my question, what do we get? %$* 142
what have we gotten for this new posture? %$* 142
response from the other side? %$* 13
wesley clark? %$* 13
first of all, i’m not going to go into the details of the president’s trip to china except to say that our relationship with the chinese is one of mutual need. %$* 143
we need them; they need us and he’s working to define that relationship in a most constructive way. %$* 143
now, whether or not china ultimately support sanctions on iran in the united nations is not going to be the decisive factor, i would predict, in this president’s decision about what to do about iran. %$* 143
so a lot of the case that has been made by the other side is predicated on hypothetical decline. %$* 143
hypothetically, iran’s going to get this, hypothetically barack obama’s not going to do that or something of the sort; i don’t think the record demonstrates that. %$* 143
i think what the record demonstrates is a very systematic working with other nations and preparing the ground for what’s going to be a very difficult decision. %$* 143
but i think dan senor was also talking about process and his point was also that the president’s trip left the impression of weakness. %$* 13
well he certainly did and what’s more, i think there was a wide sense within the chinese leadership that he was weak. %$* 144
this was the worst visit of any president that has been made to china and it is a critical country, whether or not they support what we want to do vis-a-vis iran or not. %$* 144
we came out of that with a greatly diminished sense of prestige or status or whatever, which are-- %$* 144
these are things that are very important to chinese political culture. %$* 144
and to deny that is to deny really what happened. %$* 144
that was the reality of it. %$* 144
you can argue why it happened. %$* 144
i think it was very poor staff work on the part of the president's team. %$* 144
but whatever it was, it worked out in the worst way. %$* 144
they did not understand how to play the game with the chinese. %$* 144
bernard-henri lévy. %$* 13
my impression was not the same. %$* 145
i think that there are two ways of considering the relationship between america and china. %$* 145
one way, which probably would have been the way of another president, is conflict, opposition, revival of cold war. %$* 145
we have an enemy. %$* 145
we have a new bipolar world. %$* 145
we have to win this battle. %$* 145
cold war is still alive. %$* 145
this would be one way. %$* 145
the other way is to say that there is a partnership, that there is a new order of the world of which the chinese are real partners, economical partners, financial partners. %$* 145
you know better than me. %$* 145
i am not an economist, that they own a huge quantity of american bonds and so on. %$* 145
the impression which was released, which was delivered by obama's visit was the impression of a non-hysterical relationship, of a real partnership, of new ground, a new departure for a relationship based, of course, on different visions of the world; a totalitarian regime on one side, the embodiment of modern democracy on the other side, but nevertheless a constructive partnership. %$* 145
and for this, we have to thank barack obama to have given this impression. %$* 145
and-- %$* 145
let me go to somebody else here. %$* 13
there is some road to be done still, of course. %$* 145
the road is not over. %$* 145
it's not the end. %$* 145
gentleman on the aisle. %$* 13
that is a very optimistic vision of what happened on barack's visit to china. %$* 144
i don't think there is a single-- %$* 144
i haven't seen-- %$* 144
and i've read most of them, maybe not all of them. %$* 144
i haven't seen a single person who understands what goes on in china, who thought that was a successful visit that in fact we came out with an enhanced relationship. %$* 144
quite the opposite. %$* 144
it was a diminished relationship. %$* 144
i just-- %$* 144
you can give any interpretation you want to it, but i really cannot accept that description of what happened. %$* 144
yes, sir. %$* 13
my name is eric edelman. %$* 146
i'm a retired foreign service officer and former undersecretary of defense for policy. %$* 146
i'd like to direct a question to general clark. %$* 146
but before i do, i'd like to associate myself with the comments that dan opened the debate with about general clark's service as supreme allied commander. %$* 146
during bosnia, i was the u.s.ambassador to finland at that time and was proud to be working by his side. %$* 146
but i do have a somewhat critical question about the comment you made with regard to the administration's phased adaptive approach for missile defense announced last september in eastern europe. %$* 146
putting aside the rather unfortunate timing announcing the decision on the 40th anniversary of the soviet invasion of poland to the poles, the phased adaptive approach eight months on still has not got a deployment plan that the department of defense has been able to describe to the congress. %$* 146
they can't say how many aegis ships with the sm3, block 1a and b missiles will be deployed, where they'll be deployed. %$* 146
will they be deployed in the black sea? %$* 146
and these are important questions, given that the cbo study of missile defense-- %$* 146
eric? %$* 13
described the-- %$* 146
i just want to ask you to translate yourself slightly. %$* 13
yes. %$* 146
i mean, this is a pretty smart audience, but i just want to ask you if you could find a slightly more generic way, slightly more generic way. %$* 13
the question is the general said that the phased adaptive approach the administration is deploying would provide greater capability. %$* 146
my question is, how can you judge that when we don't know what the deployment plan is? %$* 146
if you know what the capability of the aegis cruisers are, what the missiles are and what they could do when deployed there, then you have a pretty good appreciation for what it can do to protect the nations in the region when those ships are deployed. %$* 143
now, like you, i haven't seen a plan. %$* 143
i'm not in on the classified planning, and i don't know why it hasn't been released. %$* 143
and i can't defend it. %$* 143
should it have been released? %$* 143
should it have been out there? %$* 143
should it have been briefed to the allies? %$* 143
well, we could discuss that. %$* 143
i don't know whether it should have or not because i'm not on the inside of the policy-making apparatus. %$* 143
you're raising valid questions, and i am sure that the administration has thought of those questions. %$* 143
i hope they have answers to them. %$* 143
they should. %$* 143
gentleman in the blue shirt. %$* 13
hi. %$* 147
my name is stu weiss i'm a physician here in new york. %$* 147
my question is for the people on the “for” side. %$* 147
i want to go back to europe for a moment. %$* 147
so just yesterday, the european central bank decided to support the euro and to do one of the biggest bailouts in i think in history of several european countries. %$* 147
that was in spite the objections of germany and several other countries. %$* 147
and the new york times reported today that their objections were overcome in large part because of the actions of the administration and president obama. %$* 147
does that not show that he is still a significant influence in europe and still projects some strength among our allies and friends in europe that they could overcome their reluctance and bail out-- %$* 147
and support the euro? %$* 147
yes, i would say that does show that there is influence on the part of the president in terms of issues like this. %$* 144
what we are also contending with, and let's be candid about it, most of the debt of these countries is in the hands of the european banks. %$* 144
were those banks to go under because they didn't work out a plan, you would have had a major economic catastrophe in europe. %$* 144
and it would have spilled over into the united states. %$* 144
our own economic policies, i might say, leave something to be desired too in terms of building up deficits as far as the eye can see, that are going to really transform the economic wherewithal with which this country has been the bulwark of freedom in this world. %$* 144
and it's going to be a growing problem for us. %$* 144
but to have europe collapse at this point, the united states had to put whatever influence they could to bear on these decisions. %$* 144
and i am glad they did, and i'm glad it worked out because otherwise we would have had a major collapse. %$* 144
so somewhat, you give good points to the white house on this one? %$* 13
yes, absolutely, i do. %$* 144
i'm not-- %$* 144
i don't think everything the white house does is bad. %$* 144
don't get me wrong on that. %$* 144
but i think on this-- %$* 144
fair enough. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 144
fair enough. %$* 13
ma'am? %$* 13
let's let the microphone come to you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 148
how are you? %$* 148
my name is kamini kendika abdul and i'm a resident of new jersey. %$* 148
in terms of policy changing and making, this question is for dan senor. %$* 148
i think he does-- %$* 148
president obama has some say in the world in policy changing, specifically in afghanistan and the treatment of women sexually. %$* 148
i noticed in the news that there was a new policy change. %$* 148
so how do you equate what's of benefit in policy changes versus a deficit? %$* 148
and just to clarify, you feel that his statements had impact? %$* 13
oh, i do feel that he has some kind of an impact. %$* 148
no, i mean-- %$* 13
because he is against-- %$* 148
right. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
he's against the old policy of women and sexuality in afghanistan. %$* 148
right. %$* 13
but you think it's having-- %$* 13
it's not that it's being-- %$* 13
just being well received, but you think it's actually having an effect. %$* 13
well, it did actually have an impact. %$* 148
they changed the law. %$* 148
and-- %$* 148
okay. %$* 13
that's what i wanted to nail down. %$* 13
dan senor. %$* 13
i am the first to credit the president on some of the progress in afghanistan. %$* 142
what i'm saying is it doesn't compensate for a complete realignment of u.s.foreign policy in every other corner of the world. %$* 142
so it is very important what you just cited about women's rights in afghanistan. %$* 142
at the same time, the government of russia, with whom this president celebrates a reset of relationships, is engaged in a fierce political repression of opponents, is murdering journalists. %$* 142
putin is probably going to run for president in 2012 again. %$* 142
that's what it looks like. %$* 142
dissident leaders like boris nemtsov who i hosted when he came over here from moscow about a year and a half ago, couldn't get any hearing inside the administration. %$* 142
iran, i mean, the dissident movement in iran was basically left on their own, left hung out to dry. %$* 142
and the notion of the president not putting a spotlight on them, as general clark said, somehow would weaken the iranian regime. %$* 142
the iranian regime blamed us and demonized us no matter what when he did. %$* 142
and they were more than happy to do it even though we were silent. %$* 142
and as i said, here we are a year later. %$* 142
the dissident movement is weaker than it was a year ago. %$* 142
and iran is closer to getting a nuclear weapon. %$* 142
i think that makes the world a less stable place. %$* 142
and i think it is more consistent with american decline than it is american ascendancy. %$* 142
if iran develops a nuclear weapon capability, we will have a nuclear arms race in the middle east the likes of which we have never seen. %$* 142
and this is not like a hypothetical thing. %$* 142
the news reports coming out of egypt and out of saudi arabia, out of yemen of this happening. %$* 142
dan, i want to interrupt you because i want to bring it back to the question and let wesley respond as well to the question. %$* 13
and if you felt that you were mischaracterized by dan, i'm going to give you a crack at that. %$* 13
but the question was asking about the impact of the president's remarks about the rights of women. %$* 13
and she's claiming that it has some sort of real impact. %$* 13
and i think, dan, you're saying, yeah, maybe it does, but it's not enough. %$* 13
yeah, it’s important, it just doesn't compensate for foreign policy framework. %$* 142
no. %$* 143
i accept what dan says. %$* 143
it is important. %$* 143
it's certainly not the whole plank of our foreign policy. %$* 143
it's an example of how a statement by a leader can have an impact. %$* 143
i agree that the question of iran is hanging over our president as the judgment of his foreign policy. %$* 143
you know, before he was elected, he did go to israel and he did speak to aipac and he made very clear he would not tolerate iran having nuclear weapons. %$* 143
every candidate did that-- %$* 143
both parties. %$* 143
so this is something that he's worked on assiduously. %$* 143
the administration's very well aware that this challenge is coming up. %$* 143
they're laying the groundwork to take effective action. %$* 143
and you know the verdict of history will await. %$* 143
he's going to have to make the call. %$* 143
but i don't want to minimize the significance of this decision because dan is exactly right on this. %$* 143
this is a pivotal decision in the future of the middle east, the future of nonproliferation, and the future of the world security structure as we know it. %$* 143
and that's why he called the nuclear nonproliferation summit. %$* 143
that's why he reaffirmed america's commitment that we undertook in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to eventual nuclear disarmament. %$* 143
that's why he's working to line up the support of public opinion, and it's moving in our direction, china notwithstanding for their own personal and economic reasons. %$* 143
so at this point this is one of those decisions that's going to have to be made at some point, but it hasn't been made, the time hasn't come yet to make that decision, and i think the whole world will await the outcome of the president's decision on this. %$* 143
so your question wasn't about iran but precisely in a sense, but i want to move on, but you got us into an interesting area. %$* 13
sir, yes, you're pointing to yourself, and if you can stand, thank you. %$* 13
you were the only one doing that. %$* 13
thank you, my name's matt. %$* 149
i'm from brooklyn. %$* 149
my question is directed at mr. %$* 149
zuckerman. %$* 149
it was mentioned that you were a supporter of barack obama during the campaign so it seems to me that he campaigned on this policy of engagement that you oppose, and has only become more-- %$* 149
his policy in places like afghanistan and pakistan-- %$* 149
it's only become more muscular, alienating his base since he has come into office. %$* 149
so i'm wondering how you can explain that discrepancy. %$* 149
and i have another question, just very short for everybody. %$* 149
i'm only going to take one question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 149
that's just one of our rules. %$* 13
well, yes, i did support-- %$* 144
you're saying he's not engaging enough. %$* 13
obama, yes, i'm saying that engagement is not enough to deal with the issues that we have to deal with, not in iran, frankly, not in the soviet union, not with china, and not in the middle east. %$* 144
i'm not dismissing engagement. %$* 144
it's just not enough. %$* 144
and as i say, the view that so many of them have is that they don't think he is going to be tough enough to deal with the issues that really have to be dealt with in a tough-minded way. %$* 144
i hope that they are wrong and i hope that i am wrong. %$* 144
but the evidence so far frankly is not encouraging, and frankly when you deal with those people, they are not encouraged. %$* 144
i mean, this is not something that i'm making out of thin air. %$* 144
i promise you that this is what they are saying and what they are very concerned about. %$* 144
so i support engagement but engagement is one hand, the other hand is they have to-- %$* 144
you have to be able to deal not just with a handshake but with a clenched fist. %$* 144
i need to say something for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan as moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters; two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, "obama's foreign policy spells america's decline." and, sir, just, you can nod or not, i just want to ask you your critique of the president's performance is more a critique from the left, that he's become too muscular, am i correct about that, that you're citing that critique? %$* 13
so he's getting it from the other side, and i believe for now that's also the case often in europe, that where people are disappointed in europe with the president is that, in fact, he did send troops into afghanistan and that he went to accept his nobel prize and made an argument in support of war and certain causes, and that, in fact, they thought he was too tough, which is the opposite of this side. %$* 13
there are not so many critics against obama in europe. %$* 145
i don't think so. %$* 145
what is very positive and very positively appreciated in europe is that obama engaged some troops in afghanistan, maybe not enough according to some, but with some concrete, effective, and important results on the ground. %$* 145
this is an important point, with some troops, not as many as some would have wanted some real results, two sorts of results, and you have to be very concrete and go into details to appreciate these sort of things. %$* 145
number one, as i said, inside of afghanistan, isolation of the taliban. %$* 145
this is a new reality on the ground. %$* 145
the taliban are less and less fish in water in some of the valleys where they were kings a few months ago. %$* 145
number two, i happened to be-- %$* 145
i’m sorry but i was in afghanistan two years ago and i saw some units, offensive units, which were american units, fighting units, with some afghan scouts embedded in the american units. %$* 145
two years after. %$* 145
now, a few months ago, it is the reverse. %$* 145
you have some national afghan battling units with some embedded american-- %$* 145
not scouts but mentors. %$* 145
i mean by that that the situation on the ground is changing, that the new strategy implemented by barack obama and his high command has begun to give its fruits. %$* 145
let’s see if your opponents concede that point or not. %$* 13
it is concrete. %$* 145
i emphasize. %$* 145
look. %$* 142
as i made it clear at the beginning of this talk this evening, i think president obama’s decision to support general petraeus and general mcchrystal in afghanistan was enormously important. %$* 142
i actually have deep concerns about afghanistan right now, about the civilian/military coordination. %$* 142
i think we’re potentially heading for a crisis on the ground in afghanistan as it relates to civilian-military coordination. %$* 142
but that said, i don’t take one ounce away from the president’s courageous decision on afghanistan. %$* 142
to me, it’s important but it doesn’t make for a foreign policy. %$* 142
bernard, look, i have been a great admirer of yours. %$* 142
throughout your career you have advocated for human rights and the importance of standing with dissonant movements, even as a centerpiece of foreign policy. %$* 142
there were about 40 individuals that signed a letter to the president on the eve of his trip to moscow asking to meet with opposition, with democratic opposition figures in moscow while he was there. %$* 142
only one leader from the left in the united states signed it, the head of amnesty international usa.and as one left-wing blog commented, it’s a sad statement of the state of affairs that human rights has so been subordinated as a principle in our foreign policy that if someone from the left wants to advocate for human rights being an important part of a president’s visit to russia, to china, to any of these places, they have to sign a letter with a bunch of neocons like myself. %$* 142
it’s a sad statement of affairs, and i’m amazed that you are giving him a pass. %$* 142
the question of human rights is also a question inside islam. %$* 145
today, the real shock of civilization is inside islam, inside islam between islam, democratic islam and integrist and fanatic islam. %$* 145
in these battles, which is the most important battle of the moment, obama is and his team and clinton are playing a major role in separating the two in isolating the fanatics and the integrists from the moderates, in saying to the moderate muslims that we are no longer their enemies. %$* 145
that we are on their side. %$* 145
that we’re facing the same problems and that we are sharing the same values. %$* 145
this also is human rights. %$* 145
why-- %$* 145
all over the muslim world heard, listened, and heard the message. %$* 145
can i ask you a question? %$* 142
why didn’t he give that exact speech you just gave when the dissidents were rising up in iran? %$* 142
he did this in a way because it was a very complicated story. %$* 145
mousavi was nearly under arrest, was threatened with death. %$* 145
you had some dissidents who were shot dead like neda in the streets and this was a very responsible attitude to have in front of butchers. %$* 145
ahmadinejad is not a president, he’s a butcher. %$* 145
and i think that the concern of every responsible western leader was to avoid in tehran a tiananmen. %$* 145
there was the threat of a huge tiananmen, ten times maybe more bloody than tiananmen and i think that obama acted not so badly between the human rights talks between the human right attitude and between the accountability in front of what could happen on the other side. %$* 145
iranian regime's response-- %$* 142
iranian regime's response made tiananmen look like a day at the park. %$* 142
the regime was more repressive today than it has been at any time. %$* 142
the regime is stronger today than it has been-- %$* 142
no, no. %$* 145
at any time. %$* 142
let me ask you-- %$* 145
let me finish. %$* 142
and mousavi and his leaders were calling on america. %$* 142
where is america? %$* 142
why isn't america putting a spotlight on our movement giving us the oxygen we need? %$* 142
let's take them at their word. %$* 142
no. %$* 145
sir-- %$* 13
john, i have to come back. %$* 143
okay, wes, because you haven't been-- %$* 13
i have to come back on the human rights issue. %$* 143
look, i don't think the united states government under barack obama has moved one iota off its steadfast commitment to human rights every country in the world. %$* 143
now, what there is, is a disagreement about tactics. %$* 143

so, they're using the same tools. %$* 257
and just-- %$* 257
and i really have to say, the-- %$* 257
i have seen genuinely heartbreaking case of things that you should never do to people coming from administrators that are very much left. %$* 257
there was the university of wisconsin case where they were telling a student he couldn't have a bible study meeting in his own room on his own time because people knew he was an evangelical christian. %$* 257
they might find that offensive. %$* 257
again, i'm an atheist, but that's wrong. %$* 257
all right. %$* 13
let me just take-- %$* 13
i want to take this question back to angus, because i don't feel that you satisfactorily responded to the point made that because the writers-- %$* 13
the initial writers were-- %$* 13
that they would themselves would reflect their own sensibilities and those have a legacy staying power. %$* 13
your response was, the administration writes them. %$* 13
but you didn't actually address the issue of who got to write them in the first place and instill that legacy, if not the left, as your opponents are arguing. %$* 13
and there is a logic to. %$* 13
and so-- %$* 13
and so the law became the law, and the law was leftist. %$* 13
okay. %$* 259
well, i think one of the things that we need to look at here is what are the circumstances in which students who are not conservatives, who are being caught up in these. %$* 259
and i think honestly, i think, yes, you can say that they were probably liberal in their political views, but they were centrist in their views about what is appropriate discussion and debate on campus. %$* 259
and here's an example of it. %$* 259
there was a case recently where two students who were joking around with each other and one of them was white, and one of them was black, and one of them-- %$* 259
the white said to the black one, "can i get a white power? %$* 259
" and this was a joke that they had between themselves. %$* 259
and neither one of them was offended by it. %$* 259
and they were both brought up on charges because the kind of humor that they were engaging was found offensive by the administration. %$* 259
now, is that suppression of conservative speech? %$* 259
is it suppression of liberal speech? %$* 259
no. %$* 259
it's just a jerk administrator being a jerk. %$* 259
but it is political. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 258
well, let's let kirsten come in. %$* 13
kirsten powers. %$* 13
the point isn't that it's always conservatives. %$* 258
i don't-- %$* 258
that's not actually our position. %$* 258
the position is that it has overwhelmingly been used against conservatives, but liberals absolutely are affected by it as well, and that's a good example of it by liberals. %$* 258
and, you know, what we're talking about is liberals stifling intellectual diversity. %$* 258
and that kind of behavior is extremely chilling. %$* 258
so, if you're those students that you just described, and you're on a campus where you think you're going to get in trouble for a private conversation which we have a lot of-- %$* 258
you know the stories too. %$* 258
there are a lot of stories like this. %$* 258
you are going to be very careful about what you say. %$* 258
and that is going to stifle intellectual diversity if people feel like i can't say something. %$* 258
at marquette university, there was another case where-- %$* 258
in their training of the professors, they had a slide that said to the professors-- %$* 258
it was an example of something that they might have to respond to. %$* 258
two students are talking. %$* 258
they oppose same-sex marriage. %$* 258
they're talking about how they oppose same-sex marriage. %$* 258
a third student overhears them and reports them to the administration. %$* 258
they were told this was the proper handling of this incident. %$* 258
they're turning-- %$* 258
they're turning students into informants on each other for having a conversation. %$* 258
and what even the conversation had become very heated and even they said things that were bigoted? %$* 258
i mean, people are supposed to, on campuses, be able to debate things and say offensive things. %$* 258
and in that case, it's not even offensive. %$* 258
jeremy mayer. %$* 13
i couldn't agree with you more. %$* 260
and i was meeting with some of the students who are here in the audience before this began, and they were libertarians. %$* 260
and i said, "have you been stifled on campus? %$* 260
" and one of them from james madison said, "yes, because james madison has a policy that you cannot as a student group have anything about drugs or alcohol on your posters. %$* 260
and we wanted to have a debate about drug legalization, and we felt clamped down." well, trust me, that is not a liberal policy. %$* 260
that is your generation of young people have been wrapped in bubble wrap all your lives. %$* 260
and when i was in college, if they'd even tried to do that, liberals, conservatives, moderates and the crew team would have been out there fighting this. %$* 260
so, it is-- %$* 260
you really know how to compliment your audience. %$* 13
it is what angus said is that it is conservative, small c, administrators who don't want trouble with donors and press, it is not liberals. %$* 260
liberals don't like bans on what can appear on student posters any more than you do. %$* 260
are you saying administrators are conservative? %$* 258
am i saying administrators? %$* 260
yes. %$* 258
no, small c conservatives, in other words, conservative in the sense of cautious. %$* 260
okay, but we're talking about big c and big l here, so, i mean, they're liberals. %$* 258
i mean, the data overwhelmingly shows the-- %$* 258
okay, but-- %$* 259
okay, so-- %$* 259
angus johnston. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 259
so, i think that-- %$* 259
i do that so that the-- %$* 13
oh, so the-- %$* 259
right. %$* 259
that folks listening know who's talking. %$* 13
oh. %$* 259
so, you can ignore me most of the time when i do that. %$* 13
angus johnston. %$* 13
where was i? %$* 259
are most administrators liberal? %$* 259
absolutely. %$* 259
are most-- %$* 259
is most of the suppression of speech that occurs on campuses directed at conservatives? %$* 259
absolutely not. %$* 259
the majority of the suppression of speech that occurs on campuses is non-ideological. %$* 259
it is not directed at conservatives or liberals. %$* 259
and i'd also like to take this conversation a slightly different direction, if i may, and say the most-- %$* 259
the most chilling examples of suppression of free expression occur when students are beaten and when they are arrested for engaging in free speech. %$* 259
and the students who are on the receiving end of that are overwhelmingly liberal and left students. %$* 259
and-- %$* 257
greg lukianoff. %$* 13
there's something really important that i want to say, is that we're talking about how, you know, jeremy was talking about the consistency of liberals. %$* 257
and the kind of liberal that i grew up with and was one that adamantly believed in freedom of speech. %$* 257
and angus is good on freedom of speech, and we have a lot of cases on which we agree, but if the administration-- %$* 257
which overwhelmingly leans left-- %$* 257
if modern liberals were as good on free speech as the old '60s and '70s liberals were, as me and angus are on these issues, these administrative overreach things, as i said in my statement, would be impossible. %$* 257
sometimes it's active, sometimes it's just complicit, but it's allowing the stifling of intellectual diversity. %$* 257
but you don't ever complain about the real stifling of intellectual diversity, which happens at hundreds of campuses across this country that are conservative, and explicitly-- %$* 260
oh, yes, we do. %$* 257
no, i've read-- %$* 260
you have this whole statement on your website that says, "we will not take on liberty university, and stop asking us to-- %$* 260
oh, liberty, yeah. %$* 257
because they are open about their stifling, so it's okay. %$* 260
yeah, so-- %$* 257
i'm sorry. %$* 260
if you care about free speech, care about the kids at liberty, care about the kids at catholic, care about the kids at byu, care about the byu professor who was fired for saying he was in favor of gay marriage. %$* 260
we have taken on religious university after religious university, but i like how people kind of play dumb on this particular issue, where it's kind of-- %$* 257
liberty university makes you sign a contract saying you essentially give up all your rights at the door. %$* 257
what are we supposed to argue, that you don't know-- %$* 257
or that you don't know that you're going to byu and suddenly you're like, "oh, my god, it's mormon. %$* 257
it's super mormon." %$* 257
you have the right to give up some free-- %$* 257
to agree to that. %$* 257
i would never attend any of these schools. %$* 257
but i want to point out we take on religious schools all the time and for that matter we're coming out with a list of worst schools for freedom of speech. %$* 257
one of the schools that we're going to be listing-- %$* 257
and i'll-- %$* 257
and you'll have to wait to see why-- %$* 257
is georgetown university, a catholic university in d.c.wait a week to see the article, but, yes, we take on religious schools all the time. %$* 257
but, yes, if you tell people, you give up your rights on the door and you agree to that, then you have the right to do that. %$* 257
meanwhile, at yale and harvard and princeton, the big schools that people would mean when they're talking about higher education, they all promise free speech to high heaven, and they should be held to those promises. %$* 257
but when harvard had a civility-- %$* 260
when harvard tried to put a civility contract-- %$* 260
which i didn't agree with-- %$* 260
you guys were very angry. %$* 260
so, when harvard's open about it, you guys nail them, but when liberty is-- %$* 260
basically what we said is if they want to go to their donors and go to their students and say, "sorry, you know those glowing promises of free speech that we make? %$* 257
eh, we don't really mean them. %$* 257
we're going with the civility idea," they are actually free to do that. %$* 257
and i-- %$* 257
and, you know, it'd be interesting to watch them try it, but they would start losing those professors and those donors in a heartbeat. %$* 257
but they absolutely are free to do that. %$* 257
but they weren't keeping it a secret. %$* 260
angus johnston, do you want to jump in? %$* 13
well, i think that-- %$* 259
i absolutely respect the position that you all take on this issue of saying that these conservative campuses are in another category, these particular ones are in another category, and as a matter of law and as a matter of their legal right to repress free speech, yes, they have the right under the constitution of the united states, but i think it's also important to note that they are repressing free speech. %$* 259
and it's also really important to note that, no, you don't go, "oh, my god, byu is really, really mormon," when you arrive, but you might go, "oh, my god, i'm gay." and so the repression that students are facing in these campuses is real, and i think you and i agree on that. %$* 259
i think that the disagreement is you don't think that that's something for fire to take on. %$* 259
i suspect that personally you find it as repugnant as i do. %$* 259
let me move this along a little bit further to a slightly different topic, although we've circled around it. %$* 13
and that is speech codes. %$* 13
and i just want to ask the side arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
that liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus-- %$* 13
having made the argument that speech codes have been constructed by liberals, and therefore, that's a leg of your argument-- %$* 13
do you believe that there's a role for speech codes, period? %$* 13
is there speech that does need to be suppressed-- %$* 13
no. %$* 258
on a campus-- %$* 13
no. %$* 258
and no-- %$* 258
there is no role for speech codes. %$* 258
and i think especially on a campus. %$* 258
a campus is-- %$* 258
we hear a lot about how campuses are now supposed to be these safe spaces. %$* 258
they should be physically safe. %$* 258
but they should be places that you go and you feel challenged. %$* 258
and you might feel angry, and you might feel upset, and you might read things and hear things that are-- %$* 258
that are intellectually diverse, and that you would actually encounter people who think differently than you. %$* 258
and i think that a speech code just creates an extremely chilling environment-- %$* 258
especially because these speech codes are so arbitrary. %$* 258
so, there-- %$* 258
it's left to the administrators to decide what violates the speech code. %$* 258
and it's-- %$* 258
they're too-- %$* 258
they're overly broad. %$* 258
and they are sort of disproportionately used, i think, against-- %$* 258
and-- %$* 13
people who are expressing so-called wrong views. %$* 258
and is there an obligation of civility? %$* 13
civility to a point, but i think that that is overstressed, honestly. %$* 258
i think that it should be robust debate in people. %$* 258
it should be a place where students are allowed to make mistakes, you know, to say something that is offensive. %$* 258
i'm guessing you agree-- %$* 13
i couldn't agree more. %$* 260
with this. %$* 13
i couldn't agree more. %$* 260
i think the speech codes are wrong. %$* 18
and i don't-- %$* 18
i wouldn't support them. %$* 18
i just don't think they're part of a liberal ideology crushing conservatism. %$* 18
and i also agree that speech can be painful and should be painful on a college campus. %$* 18
one of fire's cases is when conservative students hold out an affirmative action bake sale. %$* 18
and they price the goods at different prices so black kids can buy them up at 25 cents, but white kids have to pay $2.and it's a graphic representation of white resentment of affirmative action. %$* 18
and it really makes some black students very, very angry. %$* 18
but i would, as a liberal-- %$* 18
side today-- %$* 18
fiercely defend the right of conservative students to do that, even if i would think it violates civility, by inflicting that kind of pain. %$* 18
but that's what a college campus must do, is be open to those kinds of debates. %$* 18
greg, can you hang on one second? %$* 13
i just want to say, after greg's response-- %$* 13
and maybe a little bit more back and forth-- %$* 13
i want to go to you for questions. %$* 13
and just remind you again how it will work. %$* 13
just raise your hand, stand up. %$* 13
tell us your name. %$* 13
first name is fine. %$* 13
if you're with a media organization or blog, we'd appreciate knowing it. %$* 13
and wait until the mic reaches you so that you can be heard clearly. %$* 13
and really, try to keep it on topic and keep it terse. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
greg lukianoff. %$* 13
just a simple sort of basic philosophical point. %$* 257
john stuart mill, in his wonderful 1859 book "on liberty," talks about civility. %$* 257
and this is why you should always be concerned about calls for civility. %$* 257
he points out that civility ends up getting defined by the people who are in charge. %$* 257
and you'll notice that when people argue for civility, they tend to actually believe that whatever they say is civil. %$* 257
and if they're angry about it, it's righteous rage. %$* 257
but if you say it and it's kind of sharp or mean, then it's incivil and this-- %$* 257
this is the one of the reasons why it is a problem that you have this incredible sort of liberal dominance on campus, is that you end up actually seeing, in some cases, what your point of view is as a-- %$* 257
and anybody opposing as being fundamentally uncivil. %$* 257
and sometimes, disagreement-- %$* 257
to be productive-- %$* 257
can't be all that civil. %$* 257
would you like to respond? %$* 13
and then i'll go to questions after that. %$* 13
i think that is something that flows in both directions. %$* 259
a perfect example is an op-ed that was written by wendy kaminer just a few days ago, where she described participating in an event which was sponsored by a campus, in which they were talking about free speech and racial slurs. %$* 259
and she used the word-- %$* 259
which i will refer to as the n word-- %$* 259
three times, and not only did she do that, she also, in using the word-- %$* 259
n word-- %$* 259
and please don't do this-- %$* 259
she said, "when i use the word-- %$* 259
when i say the n word, what word comes into your mind," soliciting the audience to say back the slur. %$* 259
and she was criticized for this. %$* 259
which i think is reasonable, because i think that's a messed up thing for her to do. %$* 259
does she have a right to do it? %$* 259
absolutely. %$* 259
but is it right for other people to say, "wow, that was really kind of gross? %$* 259
" yes. %$* 259
here's the thing. %$* 259
in her op-ed, she used the word censorship three times to describe her critics. %$* 259
nobody made an attempt to censor her. %$* 259
nobody-- %$* 259
made an attempt to fight. %$* 259
no. %$* 257
that is absolutely not true. %$* 257
yeah. %$* 258
what-- %$* 259
she was censored in the transcript. %$* 257
okay. %$* 257
no-- %$* 259
no-- %$* 259
no-- %$* 259
so, part of the story that you're missing is that when the-- %$* 257
when the students reported this, not only did they put a trigger warning at the beginning of the transcript of her speech and they didn't just censor the n word. %$* 257
they did-- %$* 257
they put "expletive"-- %$* 257
they put, brackets, "n word." they also, when she referred to this as being crazy, they put brackets, "ableist slur" in there. %$* 257
i mean-- %$* 257
so, is it your opinion that a campus student newspaper doesn't have the right-- %$* 259
no, this wasn't a student newspaper. %$* 257
this was a transcript of the-- %$* 257
no it was prepared by an individual student, a recent alum. %$* 259
it wasn't at a formal %$* 259
they have the right to, but that's censorship. %$* 257
how is it censorship? %$* 259
they literally censored it. %$* 257
they literally took it out. %$* 257
how is that not censorship? %$* 257
how is it censorship for an-- %$* 259
if it's not censorship for a private individual-- %$* 259
a private university to say, we are going to make these rules, how is it censorship-- %$* 259
well, let me just frame it this way: was it censorship-- %$* 259
is it censorship if the washington post says, "we won't print the word 'nigger'"? %$* 259
is that censorship? %$* 259
i mean, they can choose to-- %$* 257
they can choose to do that. %$* 257
is that censorship? %$* 259
i would say yeah. %$* 257
i don't consider that censorship. %$* 259
i consider that a private institution %$* 259
i think you probably just got bleeped on npr. %$* 13
yeah, i-- %$* 258
i want to go to questions. %$* 13
and right there, sir, in the aisle. %$* 13
a mic's coming up the aisle from behind you. %$* 13
greetings. %$* 18
my name's jeffrey damic i'm a united states army veteran of over 10 years and a veteran of ground zero, and i'm also a former graduate student at syracuse university which serves as a pretext to my question. %$* 18
before i get to the substance of my question, i wanted to-- %$* 18
i need you to go-- %$* 13
i need you to zoom into your question. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 18
i just want to thank the panel for extending me-- %$* 18
extending us here the courtesy of your time. %$* 18
and i wanted to thank you, ms. %$* 18
powers, because even though we disagree on many different policies-- %$* 18
sir, i'm going to have to cut you off just because we need everybody to have questions. %$* 13
but that's-- %$* 13
so my question is this: %$* 18
much appreciated. %$* 13
i currently have a department of justice office of civil rights complaint levied against syracuse university for the consistent harassment, threats and abuse i received when i exercised my first amendment rights and rights as a student and questioned the lack of forethought regarding ground zero politics mosque demonstration held on september 11, 2010. tragically, my experience is not singular in nature. %$* 18
sir, i'm going to have to pass. %$* 13
and you guys can chat afterwards only because i really need a terse question. %$* 13
okay, my question is what advice would you give-- %$* 18
i-- %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to have to pass here because i gave you three chances. %$* 13
sir, down in front here, please. %$* 13
but have a chat afterwards. %$* 13
i don't mean to disrespect at all. %$* 13
down front. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
thank you so much. %$* 18
do you mind standing up just for the camera? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name is ilan i'm a lawyer here in washington, d.c.my question is for angus. %$* 18
your proposition boils down to this notion that small c conservative administrators who are afraid of clamor, who are afraid of disruption on campus, and therefore it's not an ideological cause. %$* 18
but who is responsible for this potential clamor? %$* 18
who is responsible for this potential disruption? %$* 18
who is threatening to do-- %$* 18
overwhelmingly liberal students. %$* 259
exactly. %$* 18
and so my question, isn't that the proposition? %$* 18
don't we have to vote in favor of the proposition? %$* 18
no-- %$* 259
liberal students are the victims of the-- %$* 259
from liberals, though. %$* 18
but that's not our argument. %$* 258
we never argued it was just conservatives. %$* 258
i guess i-- %$* 259
well, so i think the question is, if-- %$* 259
if the answer-- %$* 259
if the premise of this question is, if any time an administrator who is a liberal in their personal life is violating free speech rights of somebody else, then-- %$* 259
then the answer is that, yes that is a liberal, stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 259
but, any time a liberal-- %$* 259
any time a campus does anything, it's usually liberals doing it. %$* 259
and so the-- %$* 259
i think that the question of whether it is an ideological stifling of primarily conservatives, i think that that's the more interesting question. %$* 259
and i should like to point out in-- %$* 258
the first example in greg's excellent book is a student protesting a garage being built from an environmentalist perspective, saying why are we doing this? %$* 260
and the university president, i don't know if he's a liberal or a conservative. %$* 260
i know nothing about that president. %$* 260
but he went after that student in and egregious way. %$* 260
and i appreciate that fire supported that guy because i'm glad somebody did. %$* 260
but it was not a conservative student standing up and saying, "build more garages because burning carbon's good." it was a liberal student being punished for being stridently environmentalist. %$* 260
i just-- %$* 258
i just-- %$* 258
i'm going to reiterate again that it is not our argument that it is only conservatives or even that it's-- %$* 258
that it's necessarily an ideological crusade, though it often is. %$* 258
the point is intellectual diversity is being-- %$* 258
is being stifled and that-- %$* 258
and it does-- %$* 258
and when you-- %$* 258
when you do it to a liberal or whether you do it to a conservative or do it to an agnostic, it creates a culture of fear and makes it impossible for people to speak openly. %$* 258
i'm curious also, are you saying that this stifling stems primarily or only from the administration. %$* 13
no. %$* 258
or are you also talking about a social milieu that it's peer pressure as well? %$* 13
right. %$* 258
i think-- %$* 258
i mean, we haven't talked about a lot of cases where it actually doesn't have anything to do with the administrators. %$* 258
it has the-- %$* 258
the kaminer, that was derived completely from students. %$* 258
in fact, the administrator that the president of smith was there when it happened and-- %$* 258
and it really wasn't that much of an incident. %$* 258
it was something that came from students, and students who then started protesting and demanding, you know, that the president of smith condemn this and all these other things. %$* 258
so, i think you see it with bill maher, same thing. %$* 258
you know, it was a student-led revolt against him for his comments about islam. %$* 258
these were, again, from the left. %$* 258
but it all has the same effect of making people feel that they can't-- %$* 258
they cannot say how they think because they don't know what kind of retribution %$* 258
angus johnston. %$* 13
i think it's pretty clear that wendy kaminer is not afraid of saying what she thinks because she said it in the washington post again. %$* 259
called a racist %$* 258
that's fine. %$* 259
you even mis-rep-- %$* 258
you've done exactly what they did. %$* 258
you've misrepresented what she did. %$* 258
she was actually trying to explain free speech to people, and she was actually arguing against censorship on campuses, and she was trying to make the point, you know, that we actually can handle hearing certain words. %$* 258
now, would i have done what she did? %$* 258
no, i don't think so. %$* 258
it was provocative. %$* 258
but for her to be tarred as a racist the way that she was and accused of making racist comments when you know perfectly well-- %$* 258
is what? %$* 259
she did not say something racist. %$* 258
it's chilling. %$* 258
but how-- %$* 259
wait a minute, wait a minute. %$* 259
it's a mess to make people feel that they can't-- %$* 258
they can't criticize censorship in the way that she did. %$* 258
i think that what you are left with then is saying that if something thinks that somebody is a racist, they shouldn't say so. %$* 259
no, that's not what i said. %$* 258
because-- %$* 259
well-- %$* 259
but that's not what they did. %$* 258
you're saying that they said they was a racist. %$* 258
you know that's not what happened. %$* 258
wait, wait-- %$* 18
no. %$* 258
what happened-- %$* 258
what i mean is she was tarred-- %$* 258
i mean, yeah, they shouldn't say she is a racist. %$* 258
they can say, "we don't think she should have said that." that's not what happened. %$* 258
are you saying there are certain words that are silencing in their effect. %$* 13
"racist" would be one of them. %$* 13
i think the-- %$* 258
i think the reaction to what she did was-- %$* 258
has a silencing impact in the sense that it misrepresented in the same way i that you, frankly, misrepresented what she did. %$* 258
she was saying-- %$* 258
she was talking specifically about how they are trying to censor certain works of literature on campuses because of words that are offensive to people. %$* 258
and she was making the point that this is not something we should do. %$* 258
huckleberry finn %$* 18
yeah, huck finn specifically. %$* 258
and then to have her now portray it as like the-- %$* 258
you know, like bull connor. %$* 258
you know what i mean? %$* 258
it's not-- %$* 258
that people know what happened-- %$* 258
people will make mistakes and use the word "racist" inappropriately. %$* 260
i don't think she was a racist, but i fiercely would protect the right of people to call her racist. %$* 260
that's not censorship. %$* 260
that's free speech. %$* 260
if you're a conservative on campus, and you feel stifled by a liberal majority in your student body, put on your big boy or big girl pants and go out there and take it because that's what free speech is. %$* 260
i want to remind you we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator, and we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion: liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus. %$* 13
we're taking audience questions. %$* 13
let's continue. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
sir, there. %$* 13
also, i just want to say, as i'm looking at the show of hands. %$* 13
women are allowed to raise their hands and ask questions also. %$* 13
we don't mean to stifle you. %$* 18
napp nazworth with the christian post. %$* 18
the "for" side brought up the issue that's taking place now, christian groups being kicked off campus. %$* 18
and so-- %$* 18
but i haven't heard from this side, you know, addressing that issue. %$* 18
you know, how is that not stifling diversity, often done in the name of diversity, when christian groups are being booted off campuses? %$* 18
who would like to take that question? %$* 13
because i'd like you to pay it the respect that it deserves because-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 260
i think it-- %$* 260
i think it is a very important question as-- %$* 260
jeremy mayer. %$* 13
i understand it, it has to do with leadership roles. %$* 260
so, certain campuses have a rule that says, any student organization has to have an open membership and open leadership voting which produces the odd outcome that you could have a christian group of a small group of students that a group of malicious 19 years old, who were really jerky atheists could join the group and take it over. %$* 260
and so some campus groups have said, "we'd like to have our bylaws that said the leader of the campus christian crusade needs to be an evangelical christian," right? %$* 260
how do we resolve that? %$* 260
i don't know, but i would not be in favor of booting christian groups off campus. %$* 260
i think that is a violation of free speech as well. %$* 260
and they're being voted off why? %$* 13
violation of the law, is it not? %$* 13
it's because the campus has an organization that-- %$* 260
campuses are trying to keep the student kkk group from founding. %$* 260
so, in order to keep white aryan groups from forming that would not admit black students, they try to write campus rules that would make every student group open to members of all races and religions and beliefs. %$* 260
but when you do that, you create a problem for some christian groups if an angry group of other believing students want to join their group %$* 260
okay. %$* 13
let's get greg lukianoff respond. %$* 13
i have to go back the big boy pants argument that-- %$* 257
then. %$* 257
i think you actually get in trouble on a campus for saying something that sexist, though. %$* 257
i'm ready. %$* 260
but i want to be serious for a moment in addressing that. %$* 257
again, let's talk about emily brooker. %$* 257
she's an evangelical christian student trying to get her degree in social work at missouri state university. %$* 257
she's an evangelical, and she doesn't believe in gay marriage, and she doesn't believe in gay adoption. %$* 257
she was told to do an activity where she would actually act gay in public, which she pretended she did, as part of her degree, and then she said, "i'm never doing this again." she put on her big boy pants, as it were, when she was asked to sign a petition as part of her class supporting gay adoption. %$* 257
she fundamentally did not believe this was right. %$* 257
she said she wouldn't, and they brought her into the room, and they threatened her basically with being kicked out of the program unless she actually changed her point of view, unless she decreased the distance-- %$* 257
the difference between her and the administration. %$* 257
there was a full investigation of this. %$* 257
it was absolutely horrible, the extent to which they were intolerant of an evangelical christian's belief. %$* 257
but she did fight. %$* 257
then there's also ed felkner, who was told he had to-- %$* 257
he actually had to-- %$* 257
he had to lobby for liberal causes at rhode island college or else not graduate. %$* 257
and what he-- %$* 257
when he actually said, "wait, i'm not a-- %$* 257
but i want to be in this field, but i don't actually believe in any of these things," he was not given the option to actually lobby for causes he believed in. %$* 257
the-- %$* 257
you've got to be really far gone if you think you have the power to compel people to take political stances they don't actually believe in. %$* 257
questions? %$* 13
unless it's at liberty university, then it's okay. %$* 260
i wouldn't go to liberty university. %$* 257
down on the side here. %$* 13
my name is allison, and i'm just interested in what you're talking about. %$* 19
and i have a question about trigger warnings. %$* 19
do you see those-- %$* 19
and somebody did bring them up - - do you see those as stifling free speech? %$* 19
i mean, i can see as a college professor thinking, "what do i label with a trigger warning? %$* 19
what don't i? %$* 19
how much trouble am i going to get into if half the class leaves, and how much trouble am i going to get into if i don't have a trigger warning-- %$* 19
so your question is, "does anybody here support them"? %$* 13
"-- %$* 19
and half the class is suspended-- %$* 19
my guess is that nobody supports them. %$* 13
well, where-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
student here tonight. %$* 260
we talked about date rape statistics-- %$* 260
jeremy mayor. %$* 13

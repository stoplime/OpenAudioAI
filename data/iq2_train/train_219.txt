ladies and gentlemen, we are about one minute away from beginning. %$* 13
for people who have just arrived, i want to say once again your voting pad is on the left arm of your chair, and i would like to remind everyone to turn off their cell phones now so that it doesn’t interfere with the broadcast on bloomberg and on npr, and at this point i’d like to welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
at this point i would like to introduce the ceo of intelligence squared us, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you all very much for being here, this is certainly a very will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) timely event as the nation considers what to do about sending additional troops to afghanistan and defining our strategy there. %$* 1
when we framed this debate and it’s my job tonight to explain why we chose it as a topic, we felt that the semantics of the debate might be of particular interest, we’re calling this, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan-pakistan.” our definition would’ve been, of success, would have been, first of all, to prevent pakistani nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of extremists like the taliban. %$* 1
and second to impede as much as possible, the ability of al-qaeda to operate and project its terrorist objectives outside of the region. %$* 1
we really didn’t intend this debate to be about nation-building afghanistan, but, the policy debate raging in washington these days as we speak, does seem to conflate the taliban and al-qaeda. %$* 1
and it pretty much defines success as creating a reasonably stable, reasonably democratic and reasonably strong government in afghanistan. %$* 1
so, given that, i think we’re going to learn a great deal this evening about, first of all about afghanistan’s primitive economy, dominated by heroin production, about the ungoverned tribal areas that stretch from pakistan to afghanistan. %$* 1
about the divided loyalties of the pakistani militaries and intelligence services. %$* 1
about the role of the saudis in promoting wahhabism, and about alternative counterinsurgency strategies. %$* 1
in short, this is a dauntingly complex mosaic. %$* 1
and at the end of the evening, where you vote may well turn on which side’s will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) definition of success you choose to embrace. %$* 1
and with that i’d like to turn the evening over to john donvan and the extraordinarily able group of panelists that we’ve assembled this evening. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 1
thank you, what i always like to do at this point is ask everyone for one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz who makes this all possible. %$* 13
hello, everyone, and welcome to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan and once again, it is my honor to be acting as moderator as the six debaters you see here on the stage with me at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university, will be debating this motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan.” and what debate topic could be more timely at this point for a contest like this, and that’s what this is, this is a contest, a competition of ideas, there will be winners and losers and while i am the referee, you, our live audience here at the skirball center are our judges. %$* 13
by the time this debate has finished, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before, and once again at the end, registering whether you agree or disagree with the motion. %$* 13
at the end of the debate, the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let’s take 30 seconds and reach for those keypads by your seats, and it is time to vote, at this will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) point, on our motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan.” if you agree push number “1,” if you disagree, it’s number “2” %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number “3.” if you feel you’ve made a mistake %$* 13
just push the correct button and it will automatically correct and eliminate the earlier one. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and so to the debate. %$* 13
round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn, seven minutes each, and these are without interruption, and our first debater for the motion, patrick lang who is a retired us military officer, and a former green beret. %$* 13
he’ll be taking the microphone first to argue for our motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan,” ladies and gentlemen, patrick lang. %$* 13
well ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you, this is a fascinating topic at this particular moment in american history. %$* 565
and i would’ve thought maybe that people were tired of it by now but i can see that that is obviously not the case. %$* 565
now as the chairman said, in fact i don’t think this— you can decide that question other than in the context of what it—whether or not you’re going to succeed, other than in the context of what american policy is and what the stated foreign policy of the president of the united states is with regard to this question. %$* 565
that’s— i had the fortune or misfortune to go to any number of army service schools, one of will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) them was the army war college, where they taught me a lot about the strategy of planning %$* 565
itself, you started with the mission, national purpose, you have a policy, and then you devise a strategy from that. %$* 565
then you implement that strategy. %$* 565
that’s how it works. %$* 565
now, last march i listened carefully when president obama announced that our policy in afghanistan was to disrupt, destroy, and disorganize our enemies, our specific enemies who were a danger to the united states. %$* 565
that’s a nice %$* 565
clear policy, you know, it’s not too hard to understand that. %$* 565
and to that end, general stanley mcchrystal was put in command out there, and sent out to make what is called a commander’s estimate of the situation. %$* 565
which he did, with a lot of help from various people for several months and it is now as you know, the object of great contention in the washington world. %$* 565
and the problem with his estimate, i think, that is causing so much trouble, is that it is normal in an estimate of that kind for a commander to propose several options to his superior, among which the boss can choose. %$* 565
to present only one option, in this case the option of a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign, across all of the really hostile parts of afghanistan in the context of their ruined, if ever alive economy, and their obviously rather feeble political system, is a daunting task. %$* 565
but somehow it has become-- %$* 565
what we would call an implied task for general mcchrystal, that the pacification of large parts of afghanistan and the most hostile places are in fact a necessary thing. %$* 565
and for that will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) reason, he has opted for counterinsurgency. %$* 565
now, i am happy to see so many members of my generation out here in the audience. %$* 565
there are usually too many young people for my taste. %$* 565
but— i started in the counterinsurgency business—in the church of the counterinsurgents, really. %$* 565
in 1964, if you can believe that, when the army sent me down to fort bragg to study this subject with intensity and at the feet of the most learned french and british exponents of this theory of warfare which had been created as a result of the experience of the former colonial powers in world war ii in fighting against the wars of national liberation as they were called then. %$* 565
and the communists had gotten involved in all these wars so we were against all this as well, so we studied up on this in a big way, and one of the most interesting of the guys who taught from the stage there was a great, a great scholar named bernard fall. %$* 565
bernard fall. %$* 565
some of you undoubtedly know who that is. %$* 565
and i remember watching him, i— of course i had no real idea who he was at the time but i remember him, watching him write—write on a blackboard on the stage, “counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” “counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.” and that’s really all of it right there, that’s all of it in a nutshell. %$* 565
and it is in that context that when you look at afghanistan, this huge place that’s will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) the size of texas with 35 million people of very disparate origins, many of them speaking languages that are not mutually intelligible, and who don’t like each other, a lot of them, very much, in fact you can see, that this is a very difficult thing to do. %$* 565
we tried applying this theory of warfare, counterinsurgency, across the world in the 1960s and ‘70s and ‘80s and i did it myself in south america, in east africa and southwest asia and all kinds of places, and of course vietnam, how could i forget that. %$* 565
and we found that in places where the task wasn’t too big, you know, the country wasn’t too big, the problems weren’t manageable one way or another, or people weren’t thoroughly converted to some ideology that demanded revolution, that you could do this, by enough good works and suppression of guerillas you could turn this around, and i could name places if we had time. %$* 565
in places that were eerily big and where none of those conditions applied, we—you could struggle like the devil but you wouldn’t get very far, you know. %$* 565
and i—this is the problem i have with the idea of the application of counterinsurgency, those three things, to afghanistan, i know that was four things. %$* 565
in fact, i think that is too big a task for us. %$* 565
we have been fighting for eight years, afghanistan is a huge place, it has terrible problems, economic ones, political ones. %$* 565
and the combat problem, from the point of view of a guy who fought in several wars like this including vietnam, is really very difficult. %$* 565
and i would submit to you that if what we’re going to do as general will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) mcchrystal says, we’re going to try to protect the people, which means essentially, control the population because that’s what counterinsurgency is about, just like insurgency is about controlling the population either with positive means, or means not so positive, sometimes, you’re going to have to have a lotta troops to do this. %$* 565
i mean general mcchrystal evidently wants 40,000 more people. %$* 565
well i would say to you that that’s just the beginning. %$* 565
that’s how we started in vietnam too. %$* 565
this is a big problem we’re facing in afghanistan. %$* 565
and in fact, this slice of the pie will be followed by further slices of the pie. %$* 565
and my objection to all this is, and the reason why i don’t think we can win with a counterinsurgency strategy, is in fact because i think that, three or four years down the pike, if we apply that strategy, all you good people, and your fellow citizens across the country are going to look at this, going to say, are the taliban, or whatever it is we’re calling the taliban, are they really our enemies, in the sense that al-qaeda was? %$* 565
is this really what we want to do? %$* 565
and when that happens, i suspect that what’s going to happen is you’re going to tell your members of congress that you’ve had enough of this, and then they will vote the end of the war as they did in vietnam. %$* 565
so i don’t think we can do this, i don’t think we can do counterinsurgency in afghanistan, there are other methods that could be applied, that would control the situation there over a long period of time, i don’t think we can withdraw altogether. %$* 565
but counterinsurgency in will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) afghanistan i find to be a very difficult idea. %$* 565
thank you very much. %$* 565
and now the counterpunch, steve coll is ceo of the new america foundation and his book which i’ll bet a lot of people in this hall have read, ghost wars, is a winner of a pulitzer prize, arguing against the motion that “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan,” steve coll. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 566
thank you all very much, thanks for coming out, i’m very pleased to share the stage with my friend and colleague steve clemons. %$* 566
to give you a little taste of hallway life at new america foundation, i notice a few of my friends and many of his friends but i’m trying to suppress my concern that this is going to turn out like an afghan election. %$* 566
so the question before us is whether the united states can or will succeed in afghanistan and pakistan and i thought the chairman said it well, this is obviously an elastic question that depends on your definition of success. %$* 566
so let me offer my own. %$* 566
that us policy contributes to the persistence of an afghan government that is not forcibly ruled by the taliban, and a pakistan that does not completely fail as a state, or fall into the hands of islamic extremists. %$* 566
well by that definition, which captures the bare will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) minimum of us interests at issue in the war, i think the answer is obvious, you can construct such a policy. %$* 566
whether or not we will is another question i’m sure we’ll talk about, but we certainly can. %$* 566
there are two basic reasons, one is that there is still time to define our goals more modestly and allocate our resources more realistically. %$* 566
and the second is that the situation in afghanistan and the surrounding region is not as dire as many of you may fear. %$* 566
so i want to concentrate my time now on the second argument because it’s the less familiar one. %$* 566
i hope there are some afghans in the audience. %$* 566
they can tell you better than i that we as americans diminish ourselves and—when we talk about afghanistan as we too often do as a primitive land of savage tribes that has been at war for centuries. %$* 566
afghanistan between the late 18th century and 1979 was a coherent and mainly peaceful independent state. %$* 566
although very poor, after the 1920s it enjoyed a long period of continuous peace with its neighbors, secured by a multi-ethnic afghan national army and unified by a national culture. %$* 566
that state and that culture were badly damaged, almost destroyed, by the wars ignited by the soviet invasion of 1979, wars to which we in the united states contributed disruptively. %$* 566
yet after 2001 afghans returned to their country from refugee camps, and far-flung exile to reclaim their state. %$* 566
not to invent a brand new western-designed democracy, but to reclaim their own peaceful decentralized, but nonetheless unified and even modernizing state. %$* 566
despite the manifold errors of us will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) policy during the bush administration, a strong plurality of afghans still want to finish that work. %$* 566
and they want the international community to stay, to correct its errors, and to help them reclaim their country. %$* 566
after three decades of continuous violence most afghans are sick of war, and afraid of the taliban’s return. %$* 566
we have an obligation and a national interest and we certainly have the capacity to stand by them. %$* 566
about three times as many afghans today still have a more favorable view of international forces in their country than they do of the taliban. %$* 566
millions of afghans risked their lives to vote in the recent presidential election. %$* 566
american, international and afghan government failures have certainly handed the taliban momentum. %$* 566
but the taliban are hardly unstoppable, or even as successful as many americans today apparently believe. %$* 566
today we regard iraq for example as passively stable. %$* 566
yet the per capita rate of violent death in iraq today is four times greater than the similar rate in afghanistan. %$* 566
at the peak of iraq’s war it was 20 times greater. %$* 566
we’ve heard much anxiety about the allegations of fraud in the recent presidential election and for good reason. %$* 566
fractured politics, corruption and weak leadership present some of the most important challenges to us policy in afghanistan and pakistan alike. %$* 566
these challenges do argue for a new strategy that places much greater emphasis on political approaches, than on violent military action. %$* 566
but consider what has not happened since the afghan presidential vote. %$* 566
no opposition will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) protesters have taken to the streets, not a single rock has been thrown through a single window. %$* 566
the opposition leader has spoken freely and offered pointed criticism of the sitting—sitting president, but he’s done so within the constitutional system. %$* 566
in kenya a couple of years ago the incumbent president stole his reelection and the entire country burned down. %$* 566
the afghan response to similar evidence of fraud has been entirely pragmatic. %$* 566
the great majority of afghans continue to show they want security and normalcy, they’re willing to talk their way through this crisis, we should get ourselves organized and help them. %$* 566
finally we can succeed at this course correction because we do not have to do it all ourselves. %$* 566
our presence in afghanistan is entirely legitimate, under international law the united states is—the united nations is present, every government in the region other than iran’s wants us to stay. %$* 566
russia is supporting our supply lines, china wants a stable afghanistan, india’s prime minister has announced his intention to seek a transformational peace with pakistan. %$* 566
some of our allies it’s true, including russia and pakistan, are sullen and ambivalent. %$* 566
but unlike in vietnam or iraq, this neighborhood is united in its desire for stability and security. %$* 566
and it’s united also in the conviction that american persistence in afghanistan, corrected and recalibrate, is required. %$* 566
the ultimate exit strategy for the united states from south asia is pakistan’s success. %$* 566
this is not assured but the prospects are improving. %$* 566
pakistani public opinion will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) has now turned sharply against the taliban and al-qaeda. %$* 566
the best way for the united states to support this momentum is to stay in afghanistan, stabilize that country, marginalize the taliban through population security and negotiations, and broaden and deepen its engagements in pakistan. %$* 566
the best way to assure the failure of pakistan on the other hand, a state with scores of nuclear weapons, would be to allow the taliban to return to power in afghanistan, or to conduct a narrow war of terrorism that takes no account of the aspirations or long-term security of the afghan or pakistani people. %$* 566
i’m astonished when i hear american leaders advocate a counterterrorism war that amounts to an indefinite campaign of remote-controlled assassinations by flying robots. %$* 566
this is hardly the face of america that we should be emphasizing. %$* 566
our record in afghanistan and pakistan should humble all of us. %$* 566
it should bring humility to the way we define our goals and realism about the means that we—that are required to actually achieve them. %$* 566
it should lead us to choose political approaches over kinetic military ones, urban population security over provocative rural patrolling, and afghan and pakistani solutions over american blueprints. %$* 566
but it should not lead us to defeatism or to acquiescence in a violent taliban takeover of either afghanistan or pakistan. %$* 566
we have the means to prevent that, and it is in our interest to do so. %$* 566
thank you. %$* 566
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 566
thank you, steve coll, and our next debater, steve clemons, also works at the new america foundation so this is the first time we’ve had a debater, debating with his boss. %$* 13
and we’ll see how that goes. %$* 13
steve clemons is also the publisher of the political blog the washington note, and he is arguing for the motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan,” ladies and gentlemen, steve clemons. %$* 13
thanks— thank you, while i have a chance to pay tribute to my boss and colleague, steve coll, on the blogging front, steve writes the blog “think tank” for the new yorker, you should go check it out, i hope steve writes about this. %$* 567
steve was commended the other day by senator john mccain at a forum in washington. %$* 567
john mccain said to everyone go read ghost wars, and as it turns out barack obama’s been carrying a text of ghost wars around for about 11 months. %$* 567
i think it’s the most carried-around book that obama has had, if he would just finish it we might get somewhere. %$* 567
i also want to take a moment to pay tribute to kati marton who’s a member of our board of directors and happens to be married to one richard holbrooke. %$* 567
richard holbrooke is in my view one of the most tenacious and effective results-deliverers in the global justice community. %$* 567
i put myself somewhat in the realist will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) community, but i don’t—i generally criticize some of the goals of the global justice community, for not being able to set priorities, not being able to set plans, not being able to pursue things to their end. %$* 567
and richard holbrooke does do this. %$* 567
my problem, and why i’m on this side of the aisle from my friend and colleague steve coll, is that very few people in the obama administration are like richard holbrooke, or can frame the debate in pakistan and afghanistan like steve coll just did. %$* 567
and this concerns me. %$* 567
if you speak to people of responsibility within an administration, clarity of objectives and how you’re going to get there, the game plan, being not only able to explain to the american public why we’re doing something, but to be able to create internal plans that help you execute consistent direction is vital. %$* 567
and that clarity of direction has not been in place and it wasn’t until the leak of general mcchrystal’s report, in my view, that you began to see higher prioritization of the afghanistan question. %$* 567
that is a lousy way to tell the world that we’re under good management in the united states. %$* 567
a few years ago i was in china. %$* 567
i went to see the equivalent of the policy planning staff in china, said what are you folks working on. %$* 567
and they said how to keep you guys distracted in small middle eastern countries. %$* 567
and as we’ve moved from the problems in iraq, we now have moved to a problem in south asia, and very often we talk about as steve coll did, the drama that envelops the south asian region, the very important will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) promise the united states has in possibly trying to achieve a new equilibrium there. %$* 567
but let me ask you all a question, how many of you look at china, whether you’re concerned about its security forces or indebtedness, as a major issue for the united states, just raise your quick hand. %$* 567
okay, how— hands down. %$* 567
how many of you look at in the middle east, what is unfolding with iran, iran’s nuclear intentions, as a significant, really giant hurdle for the united states. %$* 567
how many of you look at russia, some of you look at russia and what’s been unfolding in nato as a major issue. %$* 567
probably a fewer number, but they’re out there. %$* 567
yes— %$* 567
i am seeing lots and lots of hands go up, lots of concern. %$* 567
and let me tell you— the issue, the issue here today, is one, whether the united states after eight years of failing to move the needle, in fact seeing the needle come back on itself very dramatically, is convincing the world today that it can achieve the will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) objectives it sets out for itself. %$* 567
i think barack obama has inherited one of the worst economic and national security portfolios of any president in american history. %$* 567
we are not starting out at the same starting point that george bush was starting out. %$* 567
you’re starting out in major—in a major hole, in a major deficit. %$* 567
and how we conduct our primary goals and objectives, has huge consequence on the way our allies see us, and whether they depend on us or not, and it also has consequences on our foes and their behaviors, and i would argue today, that the equilibrium, the general equilibrium that the united states had around the world, has been broken, and the tectonics of global affairs have shifted around so dramatically, that as we find ourselves bogged down, into very large goals, which i think are commendable goals, but we’re not achieving them, we’re convincing iran not to negotiate in a fair and honest way, we are convincing russia to continue to move its objectives. %$* 567
we are convincing china, that we’re increasingly a basket case. %$* 567
we— china would have to finance this war. %$* 567
we’re paying $65 billion a year at current levels. %$* 567
and that’s before the add-ons, just in military terms in afghanistan today. %$* 567
that does not include what our allies are spending militarily, nor does it include the non- military expenditures. %$* 567
ladies and gentlemen, that number is bigger than the entire gdp of afghanistan. %$* 567
we could buy the whole place, we could put everyone to work. %$* 567
we could do a marshall plan in the region for something very different. %$* 567
my worry about a lot of will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) the steps that we’ve taken in afghanistan is that we’re finding ourselves increasingly in a civil war, in which the pasthun opposition which is the home base for the taliban, actually sees us increasingly as occupiers and controllers, and i worry about our inability to disentangle that. %$* 567
now there are others who have written, and les gelb did so recently in a daily beast article, les gelb the former, well-respected head of the council on foreign relations, said it’s time for the united states to find a way to turn this not just into a nato war, and an american war, but an afghan war with other stakeholders. %$* 567
particularly countries like russia and china and other stakeholders in the region where they can come in, and actually feel as if this matters to them too. %$* 567
that the instability there is happening, we are right now back into, while we have allies, back into a sense that this is our game. %$* 567
and we have some slightly reluctant fellow travelers from nato helping us, and we’re achieving none of the big, progressive goals that i think that we should be able to. %$* 567
and so as we look at this, we look at the cost and we look at how we’re operating in afghanistan, i think it’s very important to look at the consequences on us society and what it’s achieved elsewhere in the world. %$* 567
jim jones, president obama’s national security advisor, just said, that we have succeeded in diminishing al-qaeda’s resonance and its robustness, both in pakistan and afghanistan, and he said, that there is no imminent threat of a taliban takeover. %$* 567
now, this is quite different than will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) general mcchrystal’s report and i have to say, that general mcchrystal has probably written in my personal view, one of the most stark and realistic and probably accurate assessments of the mess in afghanistan today. %$* 567
i disagree with the prescription because i don’t have confidence and faith in the ability of the presidential leadership to get this right. %$* 567
my colleagues on the other aisle, are going to argue that it can. %$* 567
but, at some point you have to pull the plug, and say that it is time that we begin to move in a different direction. %$* 567
we need a consistent voice, consistent leadership, that is not happening. %$* 567
thank you very much. %$* 567
steve? %$* 13
yes— %$* 567
this makes very bad radio so can you tell our radio audience what you’re seeing, when the hands go up— %$* 13
i am seeing lots and lots of hands go up, lots of concern. %$* 567
and let me tell you— the issue, the issue here today, is one, whether the united states after eight years of failing to move the needle, in fact seeing the needle come back on itself very dramatically, is convincing the world today that it can achieve the will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) objectives it sets out for itself. %$* 567

and we have some slightly reluctant fellow travelers from nato helping us, and we’re achieving none of the big, progressive goals that i think that we should be able to. %$* 567
and so as we look at this, we look at the cost and we look at how we’re operating in afghanistan, i think it’s very important to look at the consequences on us society and what it’s achieved elsewhere in the world. %$* 567
jim jones, president obama’s national security advisor, just said, that we have succeeded in diminishing al-qaeda’s resonance and its robustness, both in pakistan and afghanistan, and he said, that there is no imminent threat of a taliban takeover. %$* 567
now, this is quite different than will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) general mcchrystal’s report and i have to say, that general mcchrystal has probably written in my personal view, one of the most stark and realistic and probably accurate assessments of the mess in afghanistan today. %$* 567
i disagree with the prescription because i don’t have confidence and faith in the ability of the presidential leadership to get this right. %$* 567
my colleagues on the other aisle, are going to argue that it can. %$* 567
but, at some point you have to pull the plug, and say that it is time that we begin to move in a different direction. %$* 567
we need a consistent voice, consistent leadership, that is not happening. %$* 567
thank you very much. %$* 567
so a reminder of where we are, we’re halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan, we have six debaters, two teams of three who are debating this motion, “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan.” our fourth speaker now, against the motion, john nagl who is president of the center for new american security, he is a west point graduate, he is a rhodes scholar, he served in iraq, ladies and gentlemen, john nagl. %$* 13
thank you, it’s a great pleasure to be here tonight to argue about a will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) subject that i think should concern us all and i’m very pleased that the american people are so closely engaged in this discussion that concerns the safety of the country, the safety of all of us, as well as the fates of many of my friends and i’m sure many of your sons and daughters and friends as well, so, it is well worth the time to invest in thinking hard about these questions and what it is we’re trying to accomplish in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 568
steve focused on why it is that we should succeed in afghanistan and pakistan, and talked to a certain extent about why it is possible for us to do so, that the situation is not as dire as perhaps has been presented. %$* 568
it is my task then to talk about part of the way we can succeed, part of the how. %$* 568
and i’d like to start off if i can by pointing out that, there has been an acceptance so far in this debate of what it is we’re trying to accomplish, of what success means. %$* 568
and success has been defined as a pretty minimal standard. %$* 568
an afghanistan and a pakistan that are not ruled by terrorists, a pakistan that still has security over its nuclear arsenal. %$* 568
i would contend, that if we cannot as a nation achieve that success, if it is impossible for the united states to ensure that pakistan retains control of its nuclear weapons from terrorists %$* 568
that that is a very, very dire situation. %$* 568
and that’s why we have invested so much as a nation to date, and why i believe we need to invest even more, because the stakes are so very high, the consequences of failure are potentially so catastrophic. %$* 568
that’s the bad news. %$* 568
the good news is that we can will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) in fact succeed in this endeavor. %$* 568
and this book tells us how. %$* 568
this is the counterinsurgency field manual written under the direction of general petraeus and general jim mattis. %$* 568
for those of you who didn’t bring it along, i’m not going to read the whole thing. %$* 568
but to quote from chapter 5 %$* 568
the way to conduct a counterinsurgency campaign is to do a number of different things, to do them all well, to coordinate them together. %$* 568
our opponents say that it is impossible for the united states to help our friends and our allies do this, i would disagree, i would say that it is enormously difficult, but that we have a learning army, a learning state department, we have adapted and we have developed the capability to do this reasonably well. %$* 568
we have a number of extraordinarily talented people, continuing to try to help our afghan partners. %$* 568
and they do it by conducting combat operations against our enemies. %$* 568
this is a component of counterinsurgency, this is the counterterrorism part, killing or capturing identified enemies of the government of pakistan, the government of afghanistan, and that happens and that will continue to happen, and we are in fact, getting far better at that. %$* 568
training and equipping host nation security forces is an essential part of a lasting counterinsurgency strategy, and it is essential for us not to have to conduct counterterrorism forever. %$* 568
so, if you want at some point the united states to be able to depart from afghanistan, then you have to support raising and training afghan security forces who in time, will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) will be able to secure their country on their own, something we have not done very well to date. %$* 568
we have to provide essential services to the population, water, electricity, most of all security. %$* 568
we have to provide them with good governance, something that, we have not helped with as much as we should. %$* 568
we have to provide them with good economic development and opportunity to have their sons and their daughters earn a decent living, so that they cannot be attracted away by the insurgents, many of the insurgents i fought against in iraq in 2003 and 2004, many of the taliban insurgents today, are economic insurgents. %$* 568
that is, there is no other way for them to feed their families, than to take money from the taliban, in order to conduct attacks against us, against the governments of pakistan and afghanistan. %$* 568
so, for a very few dollars, well-invested, we can peel away the less committed parts of the insurgency, and we can provide them with an economic opportunity. %$* 568
we were able to do this in al-anbar late in iraq. %$* 568
the process started early but really came to fruition in late 2006, early 2007, and large numbers of the insurgents turned away from fighting against us, and started fighting on our side against al- qaeda. %$* 568
we’ve done this before, the same people who made that process happen, who inspired that process in iraq, are working now to do it in afghanistan. %$* 568
so you can peel away insurgents and reduce the number of people you’re fighting, gain additional support for your effort. %$* 568
so we have done this successfully in the will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) past, it is not easy by any means, but we have a track record. %$* 568
it is also important to note that pakistan is now succeeding in its efforts. %$* 568
in march the pakistani government decided because of extraordinary american pressure, to fight against the insurgents who had taken the swat river valley, just 60 miles from the capitol of pakistan. %$* 568
and in a not very sophisticated but very effective counterinsurgency strategy, they cleared the taliban out of the swat river valley, and the people of the swat river are now returning home. %$* 568
pakistan is about to do the same thing in south waziristan. %$* 568
they are conducting an effective counterinsurgency campaign to relieve the danger to their government, and to make their weapons, and, and, and their country more safe. %$* 568
the most important thing we can do to help them in this effort, is to continue to conduct counterinsurgency on our side of the durand line in afghanistan. %$* 568
it will be enormously difficult for us to encourage pakistan to continue conducting its counterinsurgency campaign, if we decide not to do so in afghanistan. %$* 568
and the implications of that decision are enormously important. %$* 568
the single most important step we have to take, to build a secure afghanistan and a secure region, is to raise and train an afghan army that is sufficiently sized, and sufficiently well-equipped, to secure afghanistan on its own. %$* 568
in my last job on active duty in the army, i worked with afghan soldiers, i trained afghan soldiers. %$* 568
these are people who are willing to fight for their country. %$* 568
they are disappointed that we will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) have not provided the resources to get enough of them to fight for their country, in order to enable us to begin to depart. %$* 568
putting more effort into that, is the single most important step i believe, to helping america succeed in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 568
thank you. %$* 568
the next counterpunch from ralph peters, he is a former us army lieutenant-colonel, he is a writer, he’s also a novelist, his most recent novel just came out, it is called the war after armageddon. %$* 13
it is an act of imagination, but he also writes about the current situation, writing in usa today last february his assessment of afghanistan: we should smash our enemies and then leave. %$* 13
it’s the fact that we did not leave, that explains why you are here to argue for the motion that “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan,” ralph peters. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 569
looking out at this crowded house i’m really happy that i’m almost over my swine flu. %$* 569
ladies and gentlemen. %$* 569
so far this evening, you’ve heard quite a range of opinions. %$* 569
let’s look at the facts. %$* 569
we have been in afghanistan for eight years. %$* 569
we have committed enormous amounts of treasure and quite a bit of blood. %$* 569
and eight years on, the taliban have no trouble attracting volunteers %$* 569
in fact will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) their numbers are swelling. %$* 569
they are willing to take up primitive arms, and fight against the most powerful military in history, to stand with a kalashnikov, or to attack a us outpost and stand and fight, despite the helicopters and the aircraft coming in on them, and killing them. %$* 569
and we can’t get the afghan army to show up. %$* 569
eight years. %$* 569
how much training does it take. %$* 569
sophisticated weapons? %$* 569
what sophisticated weapons do the taliban have. %$* 569
bombs, rusty kalashnikovs and grenade launchers. %$* 569
the taliban are willing to give their lives for their cause. %$* 569
the afghan army and police are not willing to die for the woefully corrupt and incompetent government of hamid karzai. %$* 569
that is simply a fact. %$* 569
now my army colleague john nagl said, well, the taliban are hiring, they’re economic soldiers. %$* 569
ladies and gentlemen, you do not sign up to stand against the greatest army in history, and give your life, for the afghan equivalent of a minimum wage. %$* 569
and we pay better than the taliban. %$* 569
why aren’t they lining up, to join the afghan army and fight? %$* 569
why do our soldiers and marines have to go into battle alone? %$* 569
or, worse, watching over their shoulder to see if the afghans with them, are going to betray them or shoot them in the back, as has happened repeatedly. %$* 569
this matters. %$* 569
how many americans should die for the government of hamid karzai? %$* 569
and we can—and steve coll said, well, you know, we’re going to fix that. %$* 569
when, how? %$* 569
eight years. %$* 569
ladies and gentlemen, we have the power to stay—and the wealth—to stay in afghanistan forever. %$* 569
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) certainly beyond our lifetimes, if we wish. %$* 569
but strategy is about asking what we get out of it. %$* 569
and is it doable, strategy isn’t about what’s nice to do, it would be nice to turn afghanistan into vermont. %$* 569
but it is not going to happen. %$* 569
because, one thing we cannot do— we can fly in in our helicopters, dismount, arrive in an afghan village and get the elders to nod their heads, until we leave. %$* 569
we can bribe them for a while, they won’t stay bribed. %$* 569
but we cannot make afghans want what we want. %$* 569
a brief history. %$* 569
we’ve been in afghanistan before. %$* 569
we had major development projects, in helmand province, down where they’re fighting now, in the 1950s and ‘60s. %$* 569
nothing came of it. %$* 569
the soviets, had at their peak 140,000 troops, tens of thousands civilian advisors. %$* 569
their interagency process worked because they could order people from other departments to go. %$* 569
they have thousands of dari and pashtun speakers. %$* 569
they built hundreds of clinics and schools and factories, it’s not like just the bad soviets killing people in the movies. %$* 569
their afghan army was over 300,000 trained with helicopters and tanks. %$* 569
and they lost. %$* 569
because the people of afghanistan didn’t want what the soviets wanted them to want. %$* 569
now think of this as an investment. %$* 569
we’re investing our blood and treasure. %$* 569
what is the possibility of a positive return, for that investment. %$* 569
for the past 200 years, every foreign investor has lost. %$* 569
are we truly exceptions to history? %$* 569
is it worth the gamble? %$* 569
afghanistan is not a country, it is an accident of where other will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) people’s borders to ended. %$* 569
you cannot nation-build where there is no nation to build. %$* 569
in a tribal society, you work with tribes. %$* 569
now we may know that it would be wiser for all the tribes to get along. %$* 569
but we do not want what afghans want. %$* 569
general mcchrystal’s report is fascinating. %$* 569
in many respects it’s an objective view. %$* 569
but you know what it leaves out. %$* 569
religion is barely mentioned. %$* 569
in the counterinsurgency manual, religion is barely mentioned. %$* 569
this is even more foolish than trying to deal with the war in europe in world war ii—and ignoring nazis. %$* 569
religion may be politically incorrect to talk about. %$* 569
it’s difficult, it makes us uneasy. %$* 569
but to write a 66-page report about the taliban, and not mention the power of religion and fundamentalist islam, seems to me that we are living in a dream world. %$* 569
now. %$* 569
this debate-- %$* 569
thank you. %$* 569
this debate, the terms of it make me uncomfortable. %$* 569
because i’m in the middle. %$* 569
in a world of very strange bedfellows, i find myself aligning with vice president joe biden, or, i’d like to think he’s aligning with me. %$* 569
but the choices aren’t all in or all out. %$* 569
there are rational choices. %$* 569
ladies and gentlemen, why did we go to afghanistan in 2001? %$* 569
because of al-qaeda. %$* 569
to punish them, to smash them, and to punish those who harbored them. %$* 569
afghanistan was a low-budget terrorist motel. %$* 569
so the feds raid the motel, kill some of the bad guys, capture some, and others escape. %$* 569
and instead of going after the ones who escaped, we decided to renovate the motel. %$* 569
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) now, i would just close by saying, i believe there is still a purpose in maintaining a compact, lethal force, focused on destroying our enemies, helping pakistan to the extent pakistan deserves the help, but not allowing ourselves to be blackmailed by the pakistanis, as we have allowed ourselves to do. %$* 569
but at the end of the day, this is about flesh and blood, afghans of course, and our young men and women in uniform. %$* 569
now, i am not a pacifist. %$* 569
wars have to be fought. %$* 569
but let us ensure that they are true wars of necessity, and not wars of inertia, and bad habits. %$* 569
let’s—when we ask our young men and women in uniform to die %$* 569
if they must die, let it be for sensible strategy, and attainable goals. %$* 569
not because, we’re out of ideas. %$* 569
ralph peters, your time is up— %$* 13
not because, we’re out of ideas. %$* 569
our final opening statement, from james shinn, he is a former assistant secretary of defense for asia, and, immediately after this debate he is actually boarding a plane for afghanistan so we’re delighted, james, that you were able to, to stop off here first. %$* 13
i give you james shinn. %$* 13
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) %$* 13
to convince you on your second vote, to support this motion, i think the other team has to convince you of either one of two propositions. %$* 570
the first is, that we don’t have any serious interests in afghanistan and pakistan, and therefore we should walk away. %$* 570
or, they have to convince that we do have interests in afghanistan and pakistan, but they’re too costly to achieve. %$* 570
and therefore, we should walk away. %$* 570
although i just heard a new one from steve clemons who says, well, we may have interests, they may be costly but we can achieve them, but we should walk away perhaps because the president can’t make up his mind. %$* 570
i think that steve and john together have made a very persuasive case, for the interests that we have—we have, in afghanistan and in pakistan. %$* 570
that these interests are not just america’s interests but these are shared by our allies. %$* 570
and that we have the capacity, through the intelligent application of counterinsurgency doctrine, to achieve those. %$* 570
and listen very closely to ralph peters’ argument, the smash them and leave argument, i believe, and to still vote for this proposition requires you to go through a kind of a contortion known as remote-control counterterrorism. %$* 570
remote-control counterterrorism, that’s where, presumably, you track and you deter al-qaeda from offshore, maybe with precision munitions, maybe from satellites, maybe like that. %$* 570
i think that’s a fundamentally flawed proposition, i would will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) submit to you. %$* 570
and it’s flawed for a couple of reasons and let me share those with you. %$* 570
with some realistic talk about how you actually have to deal with al-qaeda. %$* 570
counterterrorism operations require two things, it requires intelligence, and it requires the ability to offensively strike against them. %$* 570
you need to know where they are, what they’re up to, and you need to be able to strike at them. %$* 570
there are only two sources of intelligence, if you’re tracking al-qaeda folks up in the borderlands between afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 570
and i’ve spent a good deal of the last two years, in those two countries. %$* 570
one is by signals intelligence, where you try and track where they are by their cell phone. %$* 570
even as texting new yorkers have found out that cell phones can be dangerous to your health, the al-qaeda guys have gradually stopped revealing themselves by the same notion, which leaves you, really, relying upon human intelligence. %$* 570
spies, in other words. %$* 570
we don’t have a lot of spies on the border areas between pakistan and afghanistan, the intelligence that we get about al-qaeda and their fellow travelers compassed from the intelligence networks run by the afghans, and the networks run by the pakistanis. %$* 570
if we walked away, why on earth would they share that intelligence with us. %$* 570
let’s assume for the moment that you did have the intelligence about where a cell was who were planning another attack in new york or in a london subway. %$* 570
how do you strike at them. %$* 570
right now the way we do it is with uav predators. %$* 570
they have a flight will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) range of about 400 miles. %$* 570
it’s 600 miles from waziristan to the indian ocean. %$* 570
which leaves you the option maybe like the clinton administration did in 1998, with launching a cruise missile at them, but in the hours that it takes to target and launch a cruise missile, the target’s probably gone, and worse, since it’s not accurate, you have a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dead civilians, and the cycle continues. %$* 570
fundamentally, to protect this national interest, that i believe even the other team agrees, to protect ourselves from terrorism, we need access, and cooperation, in pakistan and in afghanistan. %$* 570
we don’t need vermont. %$* 570
we don’t need to stabilize the whole country, you don’t even need to engage in counterinsurgency activities across the whole landscape. %$* 570
but you do need cooperation, you do need access, and this is about as stark a statement of national interest that i can think of. %$* 570
thank you. %$* 570
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared us debate where the motion being argued is “america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan.” and as the debate began we asked all of the members of our live audience who are our judges in this debate to vote, to tell us where they stood on this motion before hearing the arguments, and we now have the results of that preliminary vote. %$* 13
and they are %$* 13
before the debate, 48 %$* 13
will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan” (10/6/09) percent are for the motion, 25 percent against, and 27 percent undecided, and again we will ask you to vote at the end of the debate and the team that has moved the most votes, that has changed the most minds, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round 2, this is our middle round where we mix things up a little bit now, our two teams get to debate head to head, and they will also be responding to questions from me, and questions from you. %$* 13
it’ll go on for about 40, 45 minutes. %$* 13
and i want to start, by bringing something i heard from john nagl over to patrick lang, patrick lang, you are a generation ahead of john nagl, you’re both military men, you did counterinsurgency work, and you don’t seem to believe that the methods work very well and yet john nagl comes in here, he actually brings along the manual %$* 13
with the techniques and the rules and tells us that we have seen it work, in iraq. %$* 13
now, without turning this into a discussion about iraq %$* 13

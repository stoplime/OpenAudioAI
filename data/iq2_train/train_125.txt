they decide how you get it and how much you pay for it and they have that much power because they are a cartel. %$* 375
they are a form of monopoly called an oligopoly. %$* 375
the top five publishers control 80 percent of all the print books. %$* 375
as a writer, if i want to get into a bookstore, i have to go through those publishers. %$* 375
and they don't have to pay me anything, because there are 10 guys behind me who want my spot. %$* 375
amazon looked at this market and they decided publishers weren't reader's friends. %$* 375
so, they innovated. %$* 375
they opened the world's biggest bookstore with the best customer service. %$* 375
they invented the e-book reader that everybody wants, along with the app that everybody wants. %$* 375
they gave all authors a chance to reach readers. %$* 375
so, my nine books that sat on a shelf finally got out there and reached readers. %$* 375
and i guess readers like them, because i sold a million of them. %$* 375
in other words, amazon looked at all the things publishers were doing wrong and then they did them right. %$* 375
and rather than try to compete, the publishers colluded and price- fixed to raise prices. %$* 375
we'll talk more about that a little later. %$* 375
this debate is not about amazon being the writer's friend, though. %$* 375
i can give you examples that they are, but that's not what this is about. %$* 375
it's not about amazon being the publisher's friend. %$* 375
that's not this debate. %$* 375
it's not about amazon being a monopoly. %$* 375
that's not the debate. %$* 375
it is about amazon being the reader's friend. %$* 375
amazon isn't perfect. %$* 375
no person is. %$* 375
no company is. %$* 375
but let me tell you something. %$* 375
if amazon right now were building a death machine that was fueled by the screams of puppies-- %$* 375
it still wouldn't matter because they're still a friend to readers. %$* 375
thank you. %$* 375
joe konrath, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and our motion is amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
and here to debate against that motion, franklin foer. %$* 13
he is the former editor of the new republic, author of the book "how soccer explains the world: an unlikely theory of globalization"-- %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, frank foer. %$* 13
well, i'm feeling real good about the literary future right now. %$* 377
listening to these guys come out here and talk in such fawning, slavish terms about a corporation. %$* 377
amazon is a company. %$* 377
they are not-- %$* 377
they are not pursuing the greater good. %$* 377
they're not pursuing cultural greatness. %$* 377
they are a company out to make a bunch of money. %$* 377
they have done this extremely well. %$* 377
they produce things at very low prices. %$* 377
they have technologically innovated all over the place. %$* 377
i use amazon. %$* 377
you use amazon. %$* 377
and there isn't anything wrong about that. %$* 377
the problem is this-- %$* 377
it's that they have done it extremely well. %$* 377
and-- %$* 377
and a company can perform at a very high level, and in turn, obtain a monopoly. %$* 377
they can be the only player. %$* 377
matt says they aren't a monopoly. %$* 377
but when you control 70 percent of a market, that, historically, counts as a monopoly. %$* 377
in the old days, it-- %$* 377
before-- %$* 377
before the reagan revolution, before the chicago school of economics trashed anti-trust law, our authorities used to get upset when companies controlled 10 percent of any given market. %$* 377
not 70 percent-- %$* 377
nearly 70 percent of any given market. %$* 377
but this is different. %$* 377
this is books. %$* 377
this is about our crown intellectual jewels. %$* 377
this is about the thing that we should care most about in the world, because it's about imagination. %$* 377
it's about understanding our past. %$* 377
it's about rooting out people in power. %$* 377
and when you have one company that sits there, and is the chokehold for books, that becomes a problem. %$* 377
it may not be a problem just now, but it will become a problem in the future. %$* 377
and it's something that we, as readers, as citizens, as guardians of the book, need to pay incredibly close attention to. %$* 377
why do i care about this? %$* 377
well, when i wrote an article about amazon in the new republic, what was their immediate response? %$* 377
they yanked ads from the new republic. %$* 377
when it-- %$* 377
they were having the dispute with hachette, the publishing company-- %$* 377
what did they do? %$* 377
well, they punished the guy who wrote the book about the koch brothers, but they let paul ryan's book go unscathed. %$* 377
they didn't punish him. %$* 377
when a company has that chokehold, when they can decide who wins and who loses in the publishing game, we need to be very, very afraid as citizens. %$* 377
so-- %$* 377
what is amazon? %$* 377
amazon is the everything store. %$* 377
their ambitions are boundless. %$* 377
they name themselves after the largest river in the world. %$* 377
they're making woody allen movies-- %$* 377
television shows now. %$* 377
they're selling you your underwear, your socks. %$* 377
they want everything. %$* 377
they want nothing else to be able to breathe on this planet except for their consumers and the people who make their goods. %$* 377
and so that's a very, very dangerous thing, and we've seen this with publishing. %$* 377
we've seen the way that they've treated book publishers to date. %$* 377
it's not the worst offenses in the world. %$* 377
they're trying to-- %$* 377
whatever. %$* 377
but it's bad, and it portends bad things. %$* 377
they've thrown around their power in order to try to continually squeeze the publishers. %$* 377
now, i want to just say something in defense of publishers because they've been trashed considerably tonight, and i have a feeling that a lot of this debate will come down to a referendum on book publishing. %$* 377
yeah, book publishers suck. %$* 377
they're an oligopoly. %$* 377
they're five big publishers. %$* 377
they're not great, but there are going to be a lot less of them because when companies see one big powerful player who controls their market, their natural instinct is to huddle together in safety and to cower. %$* 377
and that's what's happening now. %$* 377
penguin merges with random house. %$* 377
hachette tries to buy perseus. %$* 377
and that's going to continue in the face of amazon, and that's going to continue to just squeeze the diversity out of our intellectual space. %$* 377
now, what publishers don't do a great job always of picking books, although you have-- %$* 377
when you look at the shelves in your library, you have to say, norman mailer, philip roth, zadie smith, that they've done a pretty good job of picking winners in the past. %$* 377
but that process of picking winners is incredibly important. %$* 377
if you go to amazon's self- publishing page and you look at the self-published authors, there are thousands of them. %$* 377
and i have no idea which one of them to read. %$* 377
i am too lazy as a reader. %$* 377
i don't have enough time to go read the first chapters of all these books in order to determine what's good. %$* 377
i look to publishers to see that somebody other than the author's mother thinks that the book is worth reading. %$* 377
so they play an important role-- %$* 377
in sifting through the market, which is one great thing that they do. %$* 377
the second thing that they do is that they help authors who are usually introverts and nerds and very bad at self-promotion-- %$* 377
break through in the world. %$* 377
and, you know, they don't-- %$* 377
they didn't do that for joe konrath? %$* 377
well, you know, shame on them. %$* 377
but they do a good job of that for many, many, many other authors. %$* 377
now, the most important thing that they do-- %$* 377
and joe is talking about fiction, which is fine. %$* 377
i think it's a different market than nonfiction. %$* 377
nonfiction books often involve deep reporting, many trips to the archives. %$* 377
they're very, very expensive to produce. %$* 377
you can't just sit up one day and say, "i'm going to go write a biography of virginia woolf." that's expensive. %$* 377
you got to go travel to england. %$* 377
you've got to-- %$* 377
you've got to photocopy things. %$* 377
you know, and in the way that you are able to finance a project like that is by an advance. %$* 377
they are kickstarter for authors. %$* 377
they pay authors a little bit of money at the beginning of a project which enables them to complete-- %$* 377
to complete that. %$* 377
and i could be wrong here, but i can't even-- %$* 377
i was trying to think if i could think of any self- published nonfiction books that have been successful, any great biographies or histories, and i couldn't do that. %$* 377
and that stuff is going to suffer in this new world. %$* 377
and so i think in this debate, you are readers. %$* 377
you are the defenders of the book. %$* 377
the presumption here should be that anything that is distantly threatening to the book is something that you should be very, very concerned about. %$* 377
anything that threatens this wonderful intellectual ecosystem that we have, which is already imperiled in so many different ways, shapes, and forms, needs defenders. %$* 377
it's your obligation here to step up, to send a message to amazon, and to defend the book. %$* 377
thank you. %$* 377
thank you, franklin foer. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where our motion is, "amazon is the reader's friend." i'll be right back after this message. %$* 13
now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where-- %$* 13
i need you to not chuckle during this. %$* 13
i know, i invited that. %$* 13
let's start with a round of applause. %$* 13
that'll get it out. %$* 13
welcome back to this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
our motion is, "amazon is the reader's friend." we move now on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and you-- %$* 13
from you, our live audience here in new york city. %$* 13
we have two teams debating this motion, "amazon is the reader's friend." we've heard one team, joe konrath and matt yglesias, argue for the motion. %$* 13
they're saying that amazon is the reader's friend and that this is blatantly obvious because readers are flocking to amazon. %$* 13
it's a company that gets more books to more people in more places than any other company in history. %$* 13
they are publishing writers who could not get through the door at a lot of traditional publishers. %$* 13
they represent it as a kind of a freedom from publisher tyranny, and they basically say the bottom line is that amazon makes a better progress and that the traditional publishers in this story are the bad guys. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, franklin foer and scott turow, they're saying, "it's all a trap. %$* 13
amazon is more than halfway on its way to controlling everything in publishing, that amazon is only amazon's friend, and that there will be a problem down the road when its chokehold is complete, that this is a company that cares as much about books as it does about socks and blenders, and, more than that, that the company plays dirty. %$* 13
it may be capitalism, but they're playing by rules that are going to harm writers and harm books, and, therefore, harming readers, and, therefore, it can't be the reader's friend." i want to go to the team that is arguing against the motion and put to you basically the frontline argument your opponents are saying as i just stated. %$* 13
their frontline argument is that readers are flocking to amazon, and all by itself that answers this question. %$* 13
they're the reader's friend because readers love it and that they're feeling loved. %$* 13
frank foer. %$* 13
so, one of the things that-- %$* 377
the world of the internet is a deceptive one. %$* 377
it looks like it's wide open until it's not. %$* 377
but the people who arrive first and establish advantages in that world are the ones who win and win in a major way. %$* 377
it's what happened with google, it's what happened with facebook, then it happened with amazon. %$* 377
they were able to get there first and then build distribution systems, technology. %$* 377
that's very, very hard for other companies to come in and compete with. %$* 377
and so the fact that they've actually produced this product that in some ways is genius for consumers, it's understandable that consumers would flock there, but it also helps explain why they've achieved so much market share. %$* 377
it's very, very hard for anybody to get into this market and compete with them. %$* 377
and the fact that they are the everything store, and the fact that when we do go there we're also buying movies and clothing and food and everything. %$* 377
it just becomes a matter of convenience for people to buy books there. %$* 377
let's let matt yglesias respond to that. %$* 13
so, i think it's just false that amazon is impossible for new startups to compete with. %$* 376
i think-- %$* 376
i bought these glasses at warby parker, which is an online glasses store. %$* 376
i got this suit from alton lane, which sells men's clothing online. %$* 376
i actually did get my socks at amazon. %$* 376
but you see, i mean, venture capitalists in silicon valley are, in fact, willing to back online retail competitors to amazon because they don't think it has the same kind of network effects as a google or a facebook. %$* 376
and you also see-- %$* 376
i mean, i said this in my original point, and i haven't heard it addressed, but ebooks are sold by companies that are not amazon, by well-financed companies called google and called apple. %$* 376
amazon has market share vis-à-vis those companies not because of a nefarious power but because google and apple have not brought forth a better product at a better price. %$* 376
and that's unfortunate. %$* 376
i mean, i wish that they cared as much about the book market, but it restrains amazon's ability to raise prices or squeeze consumers or do any of these other terrible things. %$* 376
so, matt, you're saying that it's not true that it's inevitable that amazon will control everything. %$* 13
exactly. %$* 376
i want to take that to scott turow. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 378
the problem with apple and google as competitors is that they don't sell physical books. %$* 378
and there's nothing wrong with the apple software and the ibooks store. %$* 378
it works as well as amazon's. %$* 378
i wouldn't say the same thing about barnes and noble. %$* 378
but the problem is it's not a book site. %$* 378
there aren't physical books there. %$* 378
they're not a full or a real competitor with amazon in that sense. %$* 378
and they got into the ebook market because they were unwilling to fully concede the space to amazon, which is what happens between these big four companies, you know, microsoft, amazon, apple, they nibble at each other's markets. %$* 378
but they're not there for real. %$* 378
joe konrath. %$* 13
well, when did it become necessary for a company to buoy up its competition? %$* 375
i mean, aren't companies supposed to try to beat the competition? %$* 375
isn't that the point? %$* 375
can you imagine the ceo of coca-cola calling his board meeting, "well, we're really kicking pepsi's butt. %$* 375
and, you know, we want to foster competition, so what we're going to do is we are going to send out teams-- %$* 375
but, joe-- %$* 13
"-- %$* 375
to beat up everybody who is drinking a coca-cola." %$* 375
joe, in fairness, your opponents are not saying that amazon should buoy up the competition. %$* 13
they're saying amazon is so successful that the competition will disappear and that would be a bad thing. %$* 13
and what company does not try to compete and gain as much market share as possible? %$* 375
but as they-- %$* 13
you've argue against oligopoly. %$* 13
they're saying that your alternative in oligopoly is a monopoly. %$* 13
well, look, scott just said otherwise. %$* 376
he correctly pointed out that apple was not originally in the book market. %$* 376
they didn't care as much about books as amazon did, but when they saw that amazon was taking over they wanted to move in. %$* 376
this is, again, i mean, this is not like a small mom and pop operation apple is running. %$* 376
they came in like in a big way. %$* 376
they haven't gained much market share because their product is not quite as good, but if amazon did any of these horrible things or if book publishers had any confidence in their own ability to market authors around amazon and say hey, we got this amazing scott turow book, why don't you find it on our hugely popular internet store, they could sell them to these people. %$* 376
okay. %$* 18
be the e-retailer. %$* 376
let's go to frank foer. %$* 13
frank foer. %$* 13
that's wishful thinking. %$* 377
i mean, it's wishful to imagine that penguin, random house is going to re-create e-commerce. %$* 377
amazon invented e-commerce and they did it very successfully. %$* 377
the problem isn't that they've done it successfully and own the market, the problem is that they use their size to treat the whole economy very badly and there're some good examples of this. %$* 377
i don't just want to be the publisher, to do business with the publishers and get the most favorable rates from them, they want to destroy them. %$* 377
they call them antediluvian losers with rotary telephones. %$* 377
they conceived a project called-- %$* 377
yeah, but they kind of are. %$* 376
there was a project called the gazelle project-- %$* 377
they're antediluvian losers and you know what? %$* 377
god bless them. %$* 377
the reason that their commitment to things other than profit-- %$* 377
yes, they are obsessed with profit, but they're also-- %$* 377
they also publish poetry and they publish histories and they publish other things that don't make conventional sense on a balance sheet, because they view their mission as to make money, but also to create and to sustain a book culture. %$* 377
amazon referred to-- %$* 377
they tried to kill the small publishers in something called the gazelle project where they wanted to negotiate with them in a way where they said that the small publishers were a sickly gazelle and they would pounce on them like a cheetah. %$* 377
all right. %$* 13
let's let the defender of the gazelle killer respond. %$* 13
joe konrath. %$* 13
a gazelle to everybody who votes for us. %$* 375
okay. %$* 375
talking about your last question monopolies versus the oligopoly and why am i against the oligopoly. %$* 375
the oligopoly wants less choice and higher prices. %$* 375
the monopoly wants more choices and really low prices and what is the topic of this debate? %$* 375
is amazon the friend to readers? %$* 375
well, what do you want? %$* 375
higher prices? %$* 375
less choices? %$* 375
lower prices? %$* 375
more choices? %$* 375
it's pretty simple. %$* 375
well, joe, first of all the monopoly sells the products, that is books, made by the oligopoly. %$* 378
no, they're made by authors, scott. %$* 375
but the problem, the problem is that the monopoly wants to put the oligopoly out of business. %$* 378
publishers are of no benefit to amazon and they are doing their best to slowly squeeze them to death. %$* 378
and that bothers you because you've made a lot of money with these publishers, and i understand that. %$* 375
because you haven't. %$* 377
no, no. %$* 378
i'm not sure you're going to want to go down that road. %$* 13
i'm not speaking for me here. %$* 378
joe. %$* 13
i'm not speaking for me. %$* 378
i'm-- %$* 378
let scott finish his point. %$* 13
there are books that cannot be written in the amazon self-publishing model, nonfiction that frank talked about takes years to write and it does require the support and investment of a publisher. %$* 378
donna tartt's "the goldfinch," a wonderful novel. %$* 378
you and i talked about that on the radio this morning. %$* 378
it took 10 years to write and it has to have the patronage of a company that believes in her talent. %$* 378
she can't do that on her own and yes, genre fiction has been very successful and there are some wonderful writers who have come to light because of that, but you are truly throwing the baby out with the bath water if you let amazon kill the publishing system that has nurtured our literary culture. %$* 378
okay, well, you know what? %$* 375
i've listened to you guys and i'm going to back off on my stance for a little bit. %$* 375
you made a point. %$* 375
advances for works of nonfiction that take a long time, we should support these, and publishers have in the past supported these, but you're conflating two things here, scott. %$* 375
it's a fallacy. %$* 375
just because that's the way things were always done doesn't mean it's the way it should be done forever. %$* 375
franklin said something great. %$* 375
only one thing, but he said something great. %$* 375
he said, "you know what advances are like? %$* 375
" advances are like kickstarter for authors. %$* 375
you know what's great about that? %$* 375
you know what's better than an advance that takes 52.5 percent of your money? %$* 375
how about kickstarter. %$* 375
wait, joe-- %$* 377
frank foer. %$* 13
you know there was a study-- %$* 377
there was a study done out of queen college about the median income of self-published authors. %$* 377
and it was found to be under $5,000.and nearly 20 percent of self-published authors reported deriving no income from their writing. %$* 377
and it says-- %$* 377
she found that only 1.8 percent of self-published authors last year made over $100,000 from their writing. %$* 377
that's not enough to sustain a living. %$* 377
you-- %$* 375
you are not comparing equals. %$* 375
it's-- %$* 375
i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i have choice. %$* 375
i want to bring matt back into this conversation. %$* 13
all right. %$* 376
please. %$* 13
matt yglesias. %$* 13
so, you know, advances is like a super-important subject here. %$* 376
and here's the fact of the matter. %$* 376
you have to understand. %$* 376
book publishers, the big ones that we're talking about that are here-- %$* 376
these are commercial enterprises. %$* 376
they're subsidiaries of big multi-national for-profit companies. %$* 376
they don't offer these advances because they're careless and just throwing money around like drunk morons. %$* 376
and they don't do it as an act of charity. %$* 376
i mean, there is, in fact, philanthropic support for certain kinds of non-profit work. %$* 376
lots of important non- fiction books are written by professors at universities, et cetera. %$* 376
et cetera. %$* 376
but book publishers pay advances because it's part of their business model, because as you say, it's required to get the book written. %$* 376
and so, the question is that either makes financial sense or it doesn't, right? %$* 376
giving people the advance in exchange for a cut of their sales is either a profitable business to be in-- %$* 376
in which case people will continue to do it in the future-- %$* 376
or else it's not a profitable business to be in, in which case it's going go away-- %$* 376
regardless of what happens with e-books, and whatever else like that. %$* 376
so, i think it's a total red herring. %$* 376
and i think, again, to focus this on the question of-- %$* 376
no one is denying that amazon is not the book publisher's friend. %$* 376
but is it the reader's friend, right? %$* 376
they're squeezing these publishers, but they're doing it-- %$* 376
they're trying to sell books. %$* 376
you sell books to readers. %$* 376
and you sell books to readers by making books affordable and by making them accessible. %$* 376
that's what amazon is doing. %$* 376
that's what makes amazon the reader's friend. %$* 376
and if you care about books, pound the table, culture, yes, culture is great. %$* 376
that's why it's great to make books more affordable and more accessible. %$* 376
okay. %$* 13
there's a presumption that's been made in this side arguing in favor of this motion, that traditional legacy publishing is a tyranny. %$* 13
and i want to-- %$* 13
i want to focus on that point with a technique we're introducing tonight, a 30-second rebuttal round. %$* 13
we just want to, like, focus in specifically on this point of whether or not it's a tyranny. %$* 13
and that's why i have with me this special bell. %$* 13
it's going to go like this. %$* 13
you get 30 seconds, one of you. %$* 13
30 seconds back. %$* 13
30 seconds back. %$* 13
and 30 seconds back. %$* 13
just to discuss this one topic, without changing the subject, or you lose your time-- %$* 13
about whether or not traditional publishing actually functions as a tyranny. %$* 13
which of you would like to go first? %$* 13
i'll be happy to talk about-- %$* 378
scott turow, okay. %$* 13
your 30 seconds-- %$* 13
will end like this. %$* 13
and your 30 seconds start now. %$* 13
right now, and it's a great thing, there are alternatives for the publishers, for the authors whom those publishers reject. %$* 378
and that's the self-publication route. %$* 378
works for some. %$* 378
and that is a great thing. %$* 378
doesn't work for most, but it's still great that it works for some. %$* 378
the problem is that the company that joe champions, amazon, wants to put the publishers out of business. %$* 378
they have no interest whatsoever in letting the publishers survive. %$* 378
it's good for them-- %$* 378
if they're gone. %$* 378
joe konrath. %$* 13
your 30 seconds starts now. %$* 13
okay. %$* 375
we don't need publishers. %$* 375
they are middle men. %$* 375
they were once essential because they were the only way you could get your book into bookstores. %$* 375
they were the only way to connect an author and a reader. %$* 375
now we do not need them. %$* 375
we can reach readers-- %$* 375
and i can reach more readers through amazon than i could with the 10-something publishers, all of which were big publishers, that i worked for. %$* 375
and it's not equal. %$* 375
it's not like you can choose to self- publish or legacy publish, because legacy publish-- %$* 375
makes you jump through – %$* 375
frank foer. %$* 13
here's why we’re going to win this debate-- %$* 377
these are the manichean guys. %$* 377
they say, "self-published authors should win and the traditional publishing houses should lose.” we are the men of peace. %$* 377
we-- %$* 377
believe that there's no reason that you can't have a world there are self-published authors working through amazon and traditional publishing, as is. %$* 377
that provides pluralism, diversity, a very rich culture. %$* 377
why can't we go there? %$* 377
because you guys have, it seems like, a little bit of a chip on your shoulder about the publishing houses, as does amazon-- %$* 377
matt yglesias. %$* 13
want to destroy them. %$* 377
matt yglesias, and the-- %$* 13
the question which has still not been answered is why is publishing traditionally a tyranny. %$* 13
traditional book publishers are much too incompetent to be a tyranny. %$* 376
i agree with frank. %$* 376
in principle, there's no reason why there can't be coexistence. %$* 376
and if you look at the movie industry or the music industry you see competing digital retailers and you see publishers of these things. %$* 376
and that's because movie studios are good at marketing movies. %$* 376
so, they do not need to fear any one distribution platform because they will sell their movies through other ones. %$* 376
book publishers are bad at their job of marketing books. %$* 376
that's why they're afraid of amazon. %$* 376
the side that's arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
in a moment i want to come to audience questions. %$* 13
and i will say this in advance, i won't be able to accept all questions if they're off point. %$* 13
i apologize in advance for saying, "no," to certain questions, which i will do respectfully, and there's no shame in being turned down, but try to keep your question on the point of this topic, this motion. %$* 13
move it forward, be terse, don't argue with the debaters, and really make it in the form of a question. %$* 13
what will happen is you'll raise your hands, and i'll have a-- %$* 13
i'll call on you, and a mike will come. %$* 13
and if you're a member of the-- %$* 13
particularly the news media or actually if you're even in the business, we'd love to know that if you're willing to share, and we'd also like to know your name. %$* 13
before we get to that, i just want to put one more question to the side arguing for the motion and then hear the response. %$* 13
your opponents are saying that-- %$* 13
your opponents are saying that amazon cannot be trusted, that it's becoming more and more powerful, and that-- %$* 13
and that's probably likely to continue, although you're saying there are mitigating forces. %$* 13
but they're saying that with the power it already has, that it's already demonstrated that it cannot be trusted to do the right thing. %$* 13
joe konrath, do you trust amazon? %$* 13
well, okay. %$* 375
i am less worried about the tiger that's going to eat me next month, and i'm more concerned about the lion that is chewing on my leg right now. %$* 375
the lion chewing on my leg is legacy publishing. %$* 375
scott turow. %$* 13
joe has managed to succeed outside that system. %$* 378

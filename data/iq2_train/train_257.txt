ladies and gentlemen we are going to go right now to the vote where we ask for your party affiliation, or lack thereof. %$* 13
there’s a keypad to the left of your seat, and we’ve designated number 1 to stand for democrat, number 2 for republican, and 3 is independent, and three would also cover communist party, libertarian, sorry about that. %$* 13
but to a degree i think that’s what we’re discussing here tonight. %$* 13
so if you take just a minute to do that and we’ll lock it in and then we’ll begin the debate. %$* 13
number 1 is for democrat, number 2 is for republican, and 3 is other. %$* 13
we’d like your cell phones off except for the few who have decided to tweet throughout the event, about the event. %$* 13
our name on twitter is @iq2us and we’re using #2partydebate. %$* 13
and now let’s welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
and it is a true pleasure to introduce the man who has made intelligence square u.s.possible. %$* 13
it's why there is an iq2 u.s.mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you and welcome. %$* 1
it's my task to frame the debate. %$* 1
why did we do this particular debate? %$* 1
and the question, of course, is, is america ungovernable? %$* 1
well, neither the most liberal democrats nor the most conservative republicans can govern the way they like. %$* 1
our system demands compromise and change by slow increments. %$* 1
and that's exactly what the founders intended. %$* 1
both parties have always had different philosophy of government and different takes on major policy issues. %$* 1
but for most of the past 50 years, there's been a sense that politics stops at the water's edge, that we won't let partisan politics jeopardize america's security or our standing in the world. %$* 1
and in domestic policy, the biggest initiatives such as civil rights, welfare reform, the nafta free trade pact, medicare, medicaid, all have substantial bipartisan support. %$* 1
well, what i am describing is hardly what politics today are like. %$* 1
both parties seem to be dominated by their most extreme elements. %$* 1
and the center is driven from the corridors of power. %$* 1
indeed, the rarity of truly civil discourse in our society is precisely what prompted the creation of the intelligence squared debate series in the first instance. %$* 1
well, how did things get this way? %$* 1
i would point to three developments, each of which quite ironically seem, on the face of it, to enhance democracy. %$* 1
first, the primary system for selecting candidates has evolved into a highly compressed series of campaigns that require well over a hundred million dollars to contest effectively. %$* 1
second, the campaign finance reform has required that those vast sums be raised in $2,000 pieces. %$* 1
and it's often the most emotional and intemperate rhetoric that prompts folks to write those checks. %$* 1
finally, the media environment has become highly fragmented, encouraging people to gravitate to news outlets that will enforce their views and drive them even further from centrist positions. %$* 1
but whether i'm right or wrong about the reasons, it's hard to dispute that the two parties are as far apart as they have been in our lifetimes. %$* 1
does that mean that america is ungovernable? %$* 1
to help you decide, we have with us tonight some of our most brilliant political commentators. %$* 1
and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and once again, i just want to say thank you to robert rosenkranz for making all of this possible. %$* 13
true or false, the two-party system is making america ungovernable. %$* 13
let's have it out. %$* 13
that's what we are here to debate under the auspices of intelligence squared u.s., i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university where we have two teams of debaters, two members each. %$* 13
arianna huffington and david brooks are arguing for the motion. %$* 13
they want to convince you that the two-party system is making america ungovernable. %$* 13
here to try to make nonsense of that argument, their opponents, zev chafets and p.j.o'rourke. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
there will be a winner and a loser. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here at the skirball center, will be the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote two times, once before you've heard the arguments and once again afterward. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to your preliminary vote. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” if you agree with this motion, press number one on your keypad. %$* 13
the keypad is to your left. %$* 13
if you disagree, press number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, press number three. %$* 13
and if you think that you have pressed a key in error, just correct your mistake, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's completed that. %$* 13
we'll be presenting the results of that vote and the concluding vote at the end of the debate. %$* 13
so onto round one. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” in round one, uninterrupted opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
and here to argue, to convince that you the two-party system is making america ungovernable, arianna huffington, who is now president and editor-in-chief of the huffington post media group. %$* 13
interestingly, arianna, you were born in a country that now has five viable parties in its parliament. %$* 13
you came of age intellectually in a country that has three viable parties in its parliaments and you are now living in a country that has two parties, is there a trend, meaningful trend? %$* 13
yes, i am fast moving toward one party rule. %$* 672
ladies and gentlemen, arianna huffington. %$* 13
thank you so much. %$* 672
david and i are here to convince you that indeed the two-party system has rendered this country ungovernable. %$* 672
and the evidence is all around us. %$* 672
wherever you look you see that we can only produce suboptimal solutions to our deepest crisis. %$* 672
and if you have any doubt about that just look around. %$* 672
why do we still have banks that we have deemed to be too big to fail? %$* 672
why did our two-party system produce three major disasters in recent years? %$* 672
the financial meltdown, the mining disaster that left 29 miners dead in west virginia, the bp oil spill, just to mention three major disasters, that were produced as a result of our completely dysfunctional two-party system. %$* 672
and, you know, for many, many years we’ve kind of postponed solving our big problems, we’ve postponed dealing with our deficit, we've postponed dealing with the decline of the middleclass, we've postponed dealing with our crumbling infrastructure, we've postponed dealing with our deteriorating education system. %$* 672
well, we can no longer keep postponing dealing with these problems. %$* 672
so while the two-party system might have been okay during the ordinary times, we’re not living in ordinary times right now. %$* 672
we actually have to solve our problems, we have no more reserves, we’ve run out of time, the chickens have come home to roost. %$* 672
and the problem with the two-party system is that is has made us all prisoners of conventional wisdom. %$* 672
it’s made us look at every political problem through that obsolete prism of right versus left. %$* 672
in fact our political problems are not susceptible to that easy completely reductionist way of looking at them. %$* 672
let’s take afghanistan, the media consider anybody who wants to leave afghanistan as a lefty. %$* 672
in fact george will, the cato institute, pat buchanan, joe scarborough, and many conservative intellectuals see no reason for us to be pursuing an unwinnable war at huge expense. %$* 672
let’s look at reforming wall street. %$* 672
there are many good capitalists who sleep with a copy of ayn rand’s books under their pillow, who believe that wall street desperately needs reforming if it’s going to actually operate like a capitalist system as opposed to operating like an oligarchy, crony, system where losses are socialized and gains are privatized. %$* 672
nevertheless the two-party system makes that kind of thinking impossible because we continue to see everything through that obsolete binary prism. %$* 672
but look around, the favorability ratings of the two parties are constantly declining. %$* 672
we now have dems at about 39 percent favorability rating and republicans at 34 percent. %$* 672
and the last election despite all the attention, despite all the media hoopla only 42 percent of the electorate voted. %$* 672
this is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction in the political system to have so many people not even participating in that most elementary duty of citizenship voting. %$* 672
and then let’s look at what would have happened in any other section of our life if we had such a vacuum. %$* 672
there would have been more competition; there would have been more participation from others, but not in our political system. %$* 672
indeed inordinate amounts of power is folded in the hands of a few so-called centrist senators, like olympia snowe, do you remember during the healthcare debate for 14 months democrats did everything they could to woo olympia snowe. %$* 672
they are like lovelorn high schoolers who are just not getting the message that she was just not into them. %$* 672
and john adams predicted what would happen when he said that “there is nothing i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other.”but that’s exactly what we have done. %$* 672
and the hunger for change is overwhelming. %$* 672
the election of barack obama is evidence of that, the rise of the tea party is evidence of that. %$* 672
there is huge mistrust of our national institutions, politicians, business people, the media. %$* 672
and the rise of social media, the rise of the internet has made it possible for young people especially to connect with each other, to reject the existing system, to opt out of politics and try to find solutions in their own communities, bypassing the political system. %$* 672
that’s not ultimately healthy because democracy is not a spectator sport. %$* 672
and if we’re going to revive democracy, if we’re going to overcome all the obstacles in the way of a truly democratic system, you know, the way we have the huge advantages of incumbency, the difficulty of ballot access, the gerrymandering of our districts. %$* 672
if we’re going to overcome all these things, we need to actually bring more competition and more voices and fresh thinking to our political system. %$* 672
because as einstein put it, to paraphrase him, the problems we are facing right now cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them. %$* 672
and that’s all that the two parties are capable of. %$* 672
so, let me just end by quoting thomas jefferson. %$* 672
in a letter to francis hopkinson, he said, “i never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of man whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else, while i was capable of thinking for myself. %$* 672
such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. %$* 672
if i could not go to heaven but with a party, i would not go to heaven at all.” well, it’s here that our two-party system is not taking us to heaven. %$* 672
in fact, it’s rapidly taking us in the other direction. %$* 672
thank you. %$* 672
thank you, arianna huffington. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable,” and here to speak against the motion is p.j.o’rourke, a journalist, a political satirist. %$* 13
does it say that on your business card? %$* 13
yes. %$* 673
he is the author of 13 books, including “don’t vote-- %$* 13
it just encourages the bastards.” ladies and gentlemen, p.j. o’rourke. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 673
thank you. %$* 673
you know, i agree with arianna about the utter cowardice and perfect ineffectuality of the two major political parties in dealing with any of the political problems that we face, and i would simply concede the debate if i were able to imagine some other political party or independent candidate-- %$* 673
left, right, or fanatically middle-of-the-road-- %$* 673
who would do a better job. %$* 673
it’s like trying to imagine a politician who would get up on the campaign stump and say, “no, i can’t fix public education. %$* 673
the problem isn’t under-funding or over-crowding or teachers’ unions or a lack of a voucher system or absence of computer equipment in the classroom. %$* 673
the problem is your damn kids.” he wouldn’t get elected. %$* 673
and the problem is us damn voters. %$* 673
and it’s not our political parties, be they few or many. %$* 673
we have voted ourselves more government benefits than we care to pay for. %$* 673
and we’re broke. %$* 673
and, you know, so are all the other democracies in the world, no matter how many political parties they have. %$* 673
indeed, other countries that aren’t democracies face the same problem. %$* 673
everybody’s broke except china. %$* 673
and china has a per capita gdp of just $7,400 a year, as compared to the dominican republic’s per capita gdp of $8,600 a year. %$* 673
so the chinese are broke too. %$* 673
so, given that we’re the problem, we might as well stick with the system that we’ve got. %$* 673
i mean, after all, we’re the ones who invented it. %$* 673
it must suit our needs in some way. %$* 673
the american two-party system is not a very good political system, but we americans are not very good at politics. %$* 673
we’re just not. %$* 673
i mean, we don’t seek the good things in life from politics. %$* 673
we seek the good things in life from pluck and luck. %$* 673
you will notice that more people are interested in the new york state lottery than are interested in the new york state government. %$* 673
now, i would argue in favor of america’s two-party system not because of america’s two political parties but because america doesn’t really have political parties at all. %$* 673
i mean, we certainly don’t have political parties in the ideological sense. %$* 673
republicans and democrats don't have ideologies. %$* 673
they just have these vague platform planks made of rotten wood of political expediency? %$* 673
if american party platforms were backyard tree forts, you would not let your children climb in them. %$* 673
anyone can join an american political party, even a witch. %$* 673
no one can be thrown out of an american political party. %$* 673
god knows my fellow republicans, i have been trying with sarah palin, and you see where it's gotten us? %$* 673
instead of political parties, what we have in america is two fund- raising mechanisms for a pair of general human tendencies. %$* 673
the tendency to leave things all screwed up like they've always been and the tendency to get the government involved and screw things up more. %$* 673
democrats are the party that says government can make us all richer, smarter, taller, thinner. %$* 673
get the crab grass out of our lawns, you know? %$* 673
the republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected, and then they prove it. %$* 673
we have the stupid party, and we have the silly party. %$* 673
now, i belong to the stupid party. %$* 673
i vote republican because republicans have fewer ideas. %$* 673
not few enough as you may have noticed in iraq, but you know. %$* 673
stupid party and the silly party. %$* 673
that would seem to me to cover the range of human political thought. %$* 673
what do we want to add to that? %$* 673
the insane party? %$* 673
the confused party, the violent party, the drunken, naked party. %$* 673
well, maybe. %$* 673
now, if the key question is governability, two-party system, they've done pretty well by world historical systems, little glitch in 1860.we're used to the idea of political parties causing civil wars, spain, vietnam, nicaragua. %$* 673
but in the case of our own civil war, both the whigs and the democrats split on the issue of slavery, thereby in fact actually delaying our civil war for more than a decade which may very well have ensured that the right side won in our civil war. %$* 673
our two political parties, silly and stupid as they may be, they've shown an ability to reconstitute or replace themselves when the nation needs it most. %$* 673
the republican party came from the mess of the whigs and the anti-slavery democrats in time to win the civil war. %$* 673
the democratic party realigned, broke the power of the dixiecrats in time to win the battle for civil rights, you know. %$* 673
even in these days of supposed extreme political polarization between republicans and democrats, there is a big overlap of feelings and ideas. %$* 673
you know, the rich should get richer but only if i'm one of them, right? %$* 673
the poor need help, but can't they knock it off with the drugs, the crime, the tattoos and the dumb music? %$* 673
we see this overlap in the number of americans-- %$* 673
i'm sure many of you will be among them-- %$* 673
who tell pollsters they are independent or, as many of us put it when we're phoned by pollsters, "go to hell. %$* 673
i'm eating dinner."but to be completely outside the two-party system just deprives candidates of any need for a sort of broad appeal, which is why america's third parties have been weird-- %$* 673
anti- masonic party, trying to keep my dad from wearing a fez and riding around on a tiny motorcycle. %$* 673
the know-nothing party, the name says it all. %$* 673
the greenback party. %$* 673
they wanted money to be worth less. %$* 673
that dream came through. %$* 673
so, we republicans had teddy roosevelt which got us woodrow wilson in world war i. you democrats had ralph nader who got you george w. bush and the iraq war. %$* 673
in the matter of political systems, never believe that they can't get worse. %$* 673
and in the matter of our two-party political system, i would say dance with the one that brung ya'. %$* 673
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, p.j. o'rourke. %$* 13
here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion: “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” you have heard the first two debaters and now on to the third to speak for this motion, to argue that the two-party system is making america ungovernable, i want to introduce david brooks, who is a columnist, op/ed columnist for the new york times and a commentator on the news hour. %$* 13
and, david, i find it interesting that your debating partner, your teammate, arianna huffington, started on the right and moved to the left. %$* 13
and you as a young man making your way through the world started on the left and moved to the right. %$* 13
what happened in your case? %$* 13
wisdom. %$* 344
ladies and gentlemen, david brooks. %$* 13
arianna, i can't explain. %$* 344
so the defender of the two-party system starts out by conceding that parties are cowardly, ineffectual and stupid and so stands by the proposition that we can't do any better, which is good counter programming toward obama standing on a position of hopelessness and changelessness, more or less standing up for the "let's go suck on a gas pipe" party. %$* 344
and i suggest you support p.j.if you have jack kevorkian on your speed dial, that we can't do any better. %$* 344
but then in the middle of his remarks, a sort of miracle occurs, and after telling us how stupid the parties are, suddenly he decides they are about to reconstitute themselves into something not half bad. %$* 344
p.j.and i are old friends, and i know he took a lot of drugs in the '60s. %$* 344
call rockefeller university. %$* 344
apparently, they're still hanging around. %$* 344
now, arianna spoke about the broad dysfunction of our parties. %$* 344
i'm going to speak about the narrow dysfunction, especially in washington where i cover it. %$* 344
i cover politicians very closely. %$* 344
and i can tell you, from this context, politicians are all emotional freaks of one sort or another. %$* 344
they have what i call logorrhea dementia, which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. %$* 344
but they do have these intense social antennae so they, if you meet them, they will guarantee to invade your personal space. %$* 344
they'll stand too close, rub the back of your head. %$* 344
i was campaigning with mitt romney up in new hampshire once, and he was campaigning in a diner with his five perfect sons, bip, chip, rip, lip, sip and dip. %$* 344
and we go in the diner. %$* 344
he introduces himself to a family and then says, “what village in new hampshire are you from? %$* 344
” and then he describes the home he owned in their village. %$* 344
and then he goes around the diner and then first-names everybody on the way out. %$* 344
so they're weird social creatures. %$* 344
nonetheless, i would say in general, they are better people than one would anticipate. %$* 344
most of them are in it for the right reason, but they're stuck in a rotten system. %$* 344
they're stuck in our current two-party system which forces them to behave in ways that are worse than they are. %$* 344
it's a mind suck. %$* 344
first of all, they cannot be entrepreneurial. %$* 344
they cannot think for themselves because they have to hew the party line. %$* 344
they get-- %$* 344
every tuesday. %$* 344
they go to a lunch. %$* 344
they get the message of the week. %$* 344
they have to parrot the message of the week. %$* 344
it's a soul suck. %$* 344
they can't behave nicely or even get to know the people in the other party because there are unofficial barriers. %$* 344
i went to something called the civility conference where annenberg took house members from both parties to the green briar hotel and got them to work together, or to meet together. %$* 344
and i went to the dining room. %$* 344
it was like junior high, all the republicans over here, all the democrats over here. %$* 344
they know nothing about each other. %$* 344
when a member of a party starts describing to me the-- %$* 344
what's going to happen on the other side, i know everything they're about to tell me is wrong because they know nothing about each other. %$* 344
finally, it's freedom destroying. %$* 344
they come in wanting to cut deals, talking in private about what they'd like to achieve. %$* 344
but they're in a tribal mentality in what-- %$* 344
what they can achieve is severely limited by the tribal sort of tutsi versus hutu nature of our politics of the current two-party system. %$* 344
so as a result, they find themselves unable to lead the lives they'd like to lead. %$* 344
arianna talked about how the big problems are therefore not addressed because they are stuck in these little trenches. %$* 344
these problems come up every day, the squeezing of the middle class unaddressed. %$* 344
i would talk about today's story, the issue of the budget. %$* 344
we are facing a fiscal meltdown in this country. %$* 344
and if you took individuals outside the party context that we have now, i bet we could all cut a deal. %$* 344
we could figure out what taxes needed to go up and what spending needs to go down. %$* 344
but we're stuck in this dysfunctional marriage where, first of all, 85 percent of the budget is completely off the table because neither party wants to touch it. %$* 344
secondly, you've got the republicans who at least have big ideas for cutting the spending. %$* 344
but they have no idea what spending should be cut and what isn't, so they're cutting some of our most valuable programs like head start and early childhood education because that's the party dogma. %$* 344
then on the democrat side, they've got some decent ideas to save head start and early childhood education. %$* 344
but the present-- %$* 344
the democrats have no persuasive ideas so we can actually cut the budget deficit and avoid national bankruptcy by 2015 or 2019.in 2019, we will be paying interest on the debt equal to about 800, $900 billion. %$* 344
and this problem has been building and building and building. %$* 344
we are completely unable to solve it because the republicans refuse to raise taxes, which is going to have to happen, the democrats refuse to talk about medicare and social security reductions, which are going to have to happen. %$* 344
we are stuck and we are heading toward a national disaster. %$* 344
so the first thing we need to do is get out of the system where we’re stuck in these party ruts. %$* 344
the university of maryland had a very interesting study where they took tea party people, they took liberals, and they said, “here’s our budget problem, you deal with it.” and the tea party people acknowledged that they had to raise taxes, the people on the far left acknowledged some spending had to be cut. %$* 344
they all could do it. %$* 344
but the two-party system can’t do it. %$* 344
the second thing we have to do is mobilize independence. %$* 344
we probably need a third party, but we certainly need a de- alignment, we need more movements to come in and affect the parties so people are less hewn to these tribal parties and that’s what the parties have become, they’ve become tribes, almost ethnic tribes. %$* 344
they are no longer the normal political groupings that they were 20 or 30 years ago. %$* 344
they’ve become tribes where your honor is attached to your tribe and any compromise seems like a sign of shame and dishonor and therefore they’re not willing to do it. %$* 344
so we need to get more movements involved, take up the two parties. %$* 344
and then finally we need a philosophy, we’ve got two parties in this country, but we’ve got three movements. %$* 344
the first movement is a liberal movement that believes in using government to enhance equality. %$* 344
the second movement is a conservative movement that believes in limited government to enhance freedom. %$* 344
but starting at the foundation of our republic there was a movement starting with alexander hamilton going up to abraham lincoln going up to teddy roosevelt which believed in limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility, to give people the tools to compete. %$* 344
this is not big government, it’s not little government, it’s energetic government to give people the tools to thrive in a capitalist economy. %$* 344
that centrist movement is completely unrepresented by the two parties and yet it’s where the largest percentage of americans are. %$* 344
so if you think, if you take a look at the fiscal situation, if you take a look at some of these big issues and you can see our current two-party system leading to a solution in the near term, you can vote for those guys, but if you can’t see a plausible way out of our problems i suggest you vote for us, thank you. %$* 344
our motion at this intelligence squared u.s. debate, "the two-party system is making america ungovernable," and here to argue against the motion, zev chafets, a columnist, the author of 12 books, the founding editor of the jerusalem report. %$* 13
we met when you were working for five years in jerusalem as the government spokesman for israel, and interesting to note, we’re talking about two-party system, israel has proportional representation, which at this point has how many parties represented in parliament? %$* 13
fourteen. %$* 674
and how’s that working out? %$* 13
great. %$* 674
ladies and gentleman, zev chafets. %$* 13
i'd like to begin by quoting something that i saw in the press just the other day, "things haven't been moving in washington, a young democratic president with an overwhelmingly democratic congress can't get much of anything passed except for defense and appropriations, which certainly doesn't add up to dynamism, a sense of delusion has set in among friends as well as foes." that, from time magazine, september 7th, 1962, and the young president they're talking about is john f. kennedy. %$* 674
and the point that i'd like to begin with is that people always say and have always said that america is ungovernable and that these are times as arianna put it which are extraordinary, different than other times, and require extraordinary and brand new solutions. %$* 674
but america has always been in unusual times. %$* 674
that's how it always seems to people when they're alive, that they're living in unprecedented times. %$* 674
in the 1920s, america confronted prohibition which made it seem that the country was ungovernable and also, you know, no place to get a drink. %$* 674
in the 1930s, there was a depression in this country which was far worse than the economic situation today obviously. %$* 674
in the 1940s, america was able to mobilize itself to go to war against nazi germany and japan even though there was a strong sentiment in this country not to go to war, an america first sentiment, which was overcome. %$* 674
in the 1950s, we all-- %$* 674
those of us who are old enough to remember, used to hide under our desks in the nuclear drills because we were sure that we were going to get bombed by the russians. %$* 674
but, in the event, america won the cold war. %$* 674
in the 1960s, the halcyon days of our youth-- %$* 674
my team anyway-- %$* 674
we not only were living in an ungovernable society, but we were contributing to it, and happily. %$* 674
the 1970s were watergate, a disaster. %$* 674
it was the end of american democracy. %$* 674
the president was forced to step down, never happened before. %$* 674
somehow the country survived those extraordinary times. %$* 674
and what brought it through each time was the two-party system, which is a stable and consistent system in this country. %$* 674
it’s what provides stability for the united states, politically speaking. %$* 674
the 1980s-- %$* 674
anybody-- %$* 674
some of you remember the 1980s, it looks like. %$* 674
that was the decade that japan was going to take over and dwarf the american economy, something like the chinese. %$* 674
and, by the way, the japanese growth national product per capita is less than america’s today. %$* 674
and then, of course, we’re living in new york, the ungovernable city, as it was called by nathan glazer in 1961, and as it was referred to by others before rudy giuliani became mayor. %$* 674
and if you look out the window, those of you who came here today, you don’t see an ungovernable city. %$* 674
you see a well governed city, both under giuliani and also under bloomberg. %$* 674
this was a miracle, but here we are. %$* 674
the american system is a resilient system. %$* 674
and the notion that this country’s ungovernable is a media trope. %$* 674
it’s not true. %$* 674
it hasn’t been true. %$* 674
i can prove it to you, if you want, with statistics. %$* 674
the world-- %$* 674
is it the world bank? %$* 674
i’m not too good at my notes here. %$* 674
because they’re in hebrew and who can read-- %$* 674
you know, seriously, i’m reading backwards. %$* 674
it’s not funny. %$* 674
i had some-- %$* 674
actually, i did have some great statistics. %$* 674
i thought i was going to impress david brooks with them, but you’ll have to take my-- %$* 674
oh, here it is. %$* 674
okay, the world bank index-- %$* 674
it has a thing called the index of governability, which is so handy for a debate like this. %$* 674
and i just looked it up. %$* 674
you know, why argue when you can have fact-based, evidence-based arguements. %$* 674
all right. %$* 674
the world bank takes into account one, two, three, four, five metrics. %$* 674
accountability and voice, which goes to what arianna was discussing, effectiveness of the government, the quality of regulation, the rule of law, and the control of corruption-- %$* 674
in all of those indices, the united states scored above the 90th percentile in the world, which is an “a,” even at nyu. and only in public stability, which is a function of terrorism, does it get a “b.”in other words, the american system is a-- %$* 674
if you say compared to what? %$* 674
compared to utopia, it’s a replaceable system. %$* 674
if you compare it to the rest of the systems of the world, it’s a pretty good system. %$* 674
and, as p.j.said, it’s also the system that fits this country. %$* 674
it was built for this country. %$* 674
and it has lasted a very long time. %$* 674
back in the day, there was a columnist that we grew up on, walter lippmann. %$* 674
and here’s what he wrote, and i like to close with it. %$* 674
this is about force of representation, proportional voting, but it stands for the system in general. %$* 674
he said that “the objection that popular government cannot be conducted without the two-party system is, i believe, refuted by the experience of europe.” “if i had to choose between a congressional caucus and a coalition ministry, i should not have to hesitate very long.” that was written in 1914, the year that world war i began inexplicably. %$* 674
and i would say that if you look at that system, the european system and the american system, which are the only two real democratic systems in the world, the american system has done pretty well in the last 80 years. %$* 674
and i think it's a-- %$* 674
thank you. %$* 674
thank you, zev chafets. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 674
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
we'll be right back. %$* 13
we are back at this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” we have to teams of two members each. %$* 13
arianna huffington and david brooks are arguing for the motion. %$* 13
and arguing against, we have p.j. o'rourke and zev chafets. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion has been arguing that we are stuck in, as they have put it, an obsolete prism of right and left. %$* 13
and the team arguing has been saying, well, actually, we've been stuck before in our long history. %$* 13
and we had a two-party system, and we worked through those crises, and the crises we're facing now are no more daunting relative to the system than they have been in the past. %$* 13
and we'll get through again. %$* 13
i want to put to p.j. o'rourke-- %$* 13
i don't know if you're a founding father kind of guy-- %$* 13
but your opponents have quoted john adams as saying he dreaded the thought of the body politic dividing into a two-party system. %$* 13
and they're arguing that there's no room for many voices when the structure is right and left. %$* 13
can you take on that argument? %$* 13
well, washington went further than that. %$* 673
i have his quote around here someplace, written also in hebrew. %$* 673
but washington said that the-- %$* 673
i wrote-- %$* 674
i write the quotes for both of us. %$* 674
yeah, yeah. %$* 673
washington warned against the spirit of party, period. %$* 673
he didn't go so far as to just worry about two. %$* 673
he worried about the system of party absolutely. %$* 673
and i would say that americans have taken that to heart, that while there are core democratic and republican supporters, and while they probably have more influence over our political system than they ought to, that americans themselves have always been a bit dubious about both of the major political tendencies. %$* 673
and there is no golden period that we can go back to in american history to find, you know, some sort of political system that would be better for us. %$* 673
the original divide between jeffersonian democrats and the federalists, the jeffersonian democrats were an unholy alliance of new york demagogues-- %$* 673
new york demagogues, who would imagine? %$* 673
new york demagogues who favored the french revolution and all the fun they were having in france and southern slave owners who favored states' rights. %$* 673
meanwhile, the supposedly more respectable federalists were the authors of the alien-- %$* 673
naturalization alien and sedition acts and the first major political witch hunt in the united states. %$* 673
i think americans have always been quite aware that both parties stink. %$* 673
let me bring in arianna huffington to pick up on it. %$* 13
you know, p.j., i would argue that if we really had-- %$* 672
believed what you believe now throughout the course of american history, we would never have made any moves towards a more perfect union because when we had slavery, you would say, oh, it's as good as it gets. %$* 672
when women didn't have the vote, you would say, well, you know, it could have been worse. %$* 672
when we didn't have-- %$* 672
when african-americans could not vote, you would say, well, you know, just think of it. %$* 672
in other countries, it's just infinitely worse, and the world bank probably would have given us an “a” rating. %$* 672
but-- %$* 672
that world bank “a” rating really worries me. %$* 672
it must have been the same kind of credit-- %$* 672
credit rating agencies that were giving junk bonds aaa ratings. %$* 672
so, you know, the idea that we're not living through unprecedented times, you know, is an unbelievably elitist idea that stems-- %$* 672
but you see, arianna-- %$* 673
no, no. %$* 672
let me just finish. %$* 672
okay. %$* 673
because this is like from people who are comfortable like we are privileged to be, those of us here on the stage. %$* 672
but just look at what's happening. %$* 672
a hundred million americans right now are worse off than their parents were-- %$* 672
so you're saying, arianna, we are in an un-govern-- %$* 13
a situation that reflects un- governability. %$* 13
and also that throughout our history, we've always aimed to do better. %$* 672
we believe that we can do better. %$* 672
zev chafets, are we-- %$* 13
are we in the mess-- %$* 13
the mess of absolute gridlock that i think is being described by your opponent? %$* 13
well, i think that arianna put it very-- %$* 674
very well. %$* 674
there was a time when there was slavery. %$* 674
and there was a time when women couldn't vote. %$* 674
and there was a time when african-americans couldn't-- %$* 674
when african-americans couldn't vote. %$* 674
and all those things no longer are the case. %$* 674
they all changed. %$* 674
and they all changed under the two- party system, which is the subject that we're debating tonight. %$* 674
the fact that there are imperfections in america is obvious. %$* 674
and the fact that there are people in america who are suffering is a constant. %$* 674
so, david brooks, why is it different this time? %$* 13
because it wasn't always thus. %$* 344
if you go back to, say, 30 years ago, and you look at the two parties. %$* 344
in the first place, the two parties overlapped in congress. %$* 344
now they do not. %$* 344
there's no common ground between them. %$* 344
in the second place, if you look at the things they were able to do, like tax reform in 1986, you had a whole series of bipartisan agreements. %$* 344
if you cover congress the way i do, you had, in those days, a whole series of personal relationships. %$* 344
that simply doesn't exist. %$* 344
and that's what-- %$* 344
there was something of a golden era, a silver area. %$* 13
no. %$* 344
there was a period of constructive competition. %$* 344
they fought. %$* 344
aaron burr killed alexander hamilton. %$* 344
i would write that as highly polarizing. %$* 344
but they fought to balance each other's weaknesses. %$* 344
and now they don't-- %$* 344
they don't-- %$* 344
they fight to stagnate. %$* 344
p.j. p.j. o'rourke. %$* 13
i think this is normal-- %$* 673
it's a normal sine wave in american politics. %$* 673
after all the 1930s, the new deal was not exactly a period of huge bipartisanship in them. %$* 673
bipartisan ideal is always a little worrisome to me. %$* 673
i consider actually the two most dangerous words in washington to be “bipartisan consensus.” it's kind of like when my wife and my doctor and my lawyer all agree that i need help. %$* 673
i just-- %$* 673
it just-- %$* 673
it concerns me a little bit. %$* 673
but finally where i come apart from-- %$* 673
i'm glad to sit here and criticize the two-party system. %$* 673
i don't have that much good to say about it. %$* 673
the alternative. %$* 673
what is the alternative? %$* 673
my biggest concern is that in a multiparty system, it leads to power in small screwy ideology. %$* 673
arguing that, you think that the system is making america ungovernable. %$* 13
are you arguing for a better-functioning two-party system, or are you arguing for a multiparty system? %$* 13
well, we are arguing for something that will shake up the current dysfunctional system. %$* 672
but what? %$* 673
but what? %$* 673
i don't want the garden gnome party holding the balance of power. %$* 673
arianna huffington. %$* 13
subsidized garden gnomes everywhere. %$* 673
let arianna have the mic. %$* 13
i thought that was michael dukakis. %$* 344
for the record that was david brooks. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 672
your notes are in hebrew and mine are in greek so we all have a problem. %$* 672
but the truth of the moment is that as an immigrant to this country who has lived the american dream. %$* 672
i'm fully aware of the fact that the american dream is dying for millions of americans. %$* 672

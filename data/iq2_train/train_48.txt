thank you. %$* 13
a little bit more just so that the camera can see you. %$* 13
great. %$* 13
terrific, thank you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is jessica. %$* 19
we've been talking a lot tonight about personal experiences and self-created memories of near-death experiences, whether those are real or just crafted by the mind. %$* 19
but i want to know what the against side has to say about admittedly self-proclaimed psychic mediums, or people completely removed from the situation that seem to have knowledge of events that they were not present for. %$* 19
i think that's relevant because your opponents have actually brought up situations like that. %$* 13
so let's go ahead. %$* 13
thanks for the question. %$* 13
sean carroll. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i think that, again, there is evidence in favor of those kinds of things. %$* 236
there is other evidence against those kinds of things. %$* 236
and the kind of remote seeing or telepathy or telekinesis or clairvoyance that is being talked about here is in utter and complete violation with everything we understand about the current laws of physics. %$* 236
so, if something is seeing something, it has to be able to absorb photons. %$* 236
how does that happen? %$* 236
i think that there's, again, an overwhelming presumption that stuff that is in so flagrant violation with everything we understand about the fundamental way that matter and energy works better have amazingly good evidence in favor of it. %$* 236
and the evidence in favor of psychic phenomena comes nowhere near that standard. %$* 236
eben? %$* 13
even if we put plausibility aside, a hundred years of parapsychological research has not been able to produce one bit of compelling replicable evidence that shows that it's a real phenomenon. %$* 237
so, eben alexander, that sounds like the most powerful salvo against your side yet. %$* 13
so what is your response to that? %$* 13
my response is that the evidence for things like telepathy, precognition, remote viewing, out of body experiences, past life memories in children, the afterdeath communications is overwhelmingly positive evidence that it exists and is real. %$* 234
for those out there in the scientific-- %$* 234
community who want to know more, i would urge them to check the book, "irreducible mind: toward a psychology for the 21st century," 800 pages of very dense science data and analysis that shows the absolute reality of nonlocal consciousness in all of those forms. %$* 234
it shows that we have a long way to go in beginning to understand anything about consciousness and that the model that brain creates consciousness and that we can only know things locally with our connected senses is completely false and disproven by a lot of scientists, not just in that book, and those who participated in that, but in multiple other books. %$* 234
and, i mean, for example, the afterlife experiments dr. %$* 234
gary schwartz, that's a pretty powerful documentation of the power of mediums. %$* 234
there are-- %$* 234
two sentences, what were they so we have something concrete for those of us who have not read the book, which is a lot of people. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 234
of gary shwartzâ€™s experiments. %$* 13
give a two-sentence example of what he did. %$* 13
basically, did a scientific assessment of mediums and their ability to work especially with-- %$* 234
and showed what? %$* 13
established what? %$* 13
well, established that they could communicate and know things that only could be known by the departed relative. %$* 234
okay. %$* 13
so your opponents are saying that there are scientific experiment that's prove paranormal activity is valid, happens, it's real. %$* 13
steven novella. %$* 13
demonstrably not true. %$* 237
i mean, everything you said is the exact opposite of the truth. %$* 237
schwartz's methodology was massively flawed. %$* 237
it's been absolutely picked apart by other scientists. %$* 237
he essentially allowed himself to be bamboozled by charlatans and by cold readers. %$* 237
he did not produce anything reliable, anything that i would consider to be credible scientific evidence. %$* 237
okay. %$* 13
so that's the bottom line. %$* 237
yeah. %$* 13
eben, do you want to respond to that, or should we move on? %$* 13
well, simply to say, i guess with this kind of thing maybe we're at a bit of an impasse because i think that his methodology was actually quite solid. %$* 234
i've met mediums who have convinced me very strongly they're absolutely real. %$* 234
all right. %$* 13
there are moments in these debates where we reach impasse, and we move on, and we have just done that. %$* 13
ma'am. %$* 13
mic-- %$* 13
microphone is coming to you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is stephanie. %$* 19
so it feels like we are conflating two different questions, and one is whether the mind and consciousness come from the brain, and the other is whether there exists an afterlife. %$* 19
and i don't understand why the existence of an afterlife would show up in the brain. %$* 19
and so i'm wondering, for the-- %$* 19
i'm going to clarify you-- %$* 13
after you, and then move on. %$* 13
the argument that's being made by the team arguing against the motion is that life stops when the brain dies, and that's why those two things have become conflated. %$* 13
and i think it fits pretty-- %$* 13
together pretty well. %$* 13
right down in front, ma'am. %$* 13
you need the mic too. %$* 13
my name is jane, and my question is for the opposing side. %$* 19
we have energy while we're alive. %$* 19
where does our energy go when we die? %$* 19
it doesn't go away. %$* 236
it's up in your head. %$* 236
they're just not continuing to live. %$* 236
it's exactly the same place the flame goes when you put out the candle. %$* 236
does the other side want to-- %$* 13
does the other side want to take on the candle argument or-- %$* 13
i would say it's more a question of the information, you know, than the energy. %$* 234
it's not a conservation issue around energy. %$* 234
people often use that one to argue against a soul being able to influence the material world. %$* 234
i would say it's much more a question of the information, and especially when you-- %$* 234
as i said, when you-- %$* 234
for example, a very renowned skeptic and scientist, carl sagan admitted that past life memories in children, the evidence for that is overwhelming. %$* 234
that's not true. %$* 237
come on, carl sagan, please. %$* 237
he said that in his book, in his book, "the demon haunted world," on page 302, he says exactly that. %$* 234
i've read that book a hundred times. %$* 237
carl sagan did not believe in past lives. %$* 237
he did not believe in anything paranormal or supernatural. %$* 237
that is just not true. %$* 237
impass on carl sagan. %$* 13
question down front. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
building on the past lives, i wanted to preface my question by saying i'm a student of dr. %$* 19
brian weiss who is an expert in past life memories. %$* 19
my question is actually for the against. %$* 19
i recently became aware of a study by a man named dr. %$* 19
kenneth ring who had done research around near-death experiences for people who were born in this lifetime blind. %$* 19
and they described having experiences of seeing and describing color and describing paintings and the color of the carpet. %$* 19
how can you explain that? %$* 19
is there some kind of brain mapping that happens, you know, that's inherently human that doesn't, you know, involve needing that particular sense? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
how can you explain that? %$* 19
i that question. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
who would like to take it, steven novella? %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i haven't read that particular study, so i don't have any detailed information about the specifics, or i'd certainly be interested in taking a look at it. %$* 237
but just the notion that somebody can explain something beyond their experience is not unusual. %$* 237
we are actually pretty creative, inventive people. %$* 237
you know, our human brains have no problem inventing things that we haven't directly experienced. %$* 237
so again, i would need to see details that could not be explained as a brain experience in order to find it compelling. %$* 237
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is "death is not final." %$* 13
and now we move on to round three. %$* 13
in round three, we will have closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted at the beginning of the debate because immediately after their closing statements, you will vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "death is not final." and here to summarize his position supporting the motion that death is not final, eben alexander, an academic neurosurgeon and author of the bestselling book, "proof of heaven." %$* 13
well, i would like to go back to what sean had said about how consciousness is very confusing to us as is quantum mechanics. %$* 234
and i would put out there, i think they're related. %$* 234
there's a reason why they're both so confusing. %$* 234
and that's-- %$* 234
you can chuckle, but in fact, that's what drove brilliant people like einstein and others into mysticism. %$* 234
and in fact, i would say that that mystery has only gotten much deeper over time. %$* 234
we have not answered that at all. %$* 234
in support of my claim earlier about brain damage allowing enhanced function, which really goes against the materialist model that steven talked about earlier, i point out two very common examples in clinical practice; acquired savant syndromes, in which strobe brain trauma, autism, can allow super human mental function, something that's often seen, that certainly has no explanation from the brain makes mind model; and also terminal lucidity, in which demented elderly patients often have periods of great clarity, especially around the time that they are encountering souls of departed loved ones that are there to escort them over. %$* 234
and i would say that these very commonly observed phenomena really demand a much deeper model of consciousness than we get out of the materialist models. %$* 234
i'll point out that dr. %$* 234
wilder penfield wrote a book in 1975, "the conscious mind." he probably still holds the record for having stimulated the brain in awake patients more than any other neurosurgeon. %$* 234
and never once did he duplicate any kind of situation of free will. %$* 234
he concluded very strongly that the mind consciousness is not created in the physical brain. %$* 234
and i think it's important to point out that the pure materialism fails. %$* 234
it's a hard problem of consciousness and at the enigma of quantum mechanics, that the brain actually confines and limits consciousness, that science acknowledging consciousness, soul and the spirit becomes much stronger than the overly simplistic science of reductive materialism. %$* 234
death of the physical brain and body is not final. %$* 234
thank you. %$* 234
thank you, eben alexander. %$* 13
and that is our motion, "death is not final." and here to argue against the motion, steven novella. %$* 13
he's a neurologist at yale school of medicine and founder of science based medicine. %$* 13
so up until a couple hundred years ago, every culture in the world believed that there was a life energy. %$* 237
they knew intuitively, they sensed that there was something fundamentally different about living things from nonliving things, and they hypothesized that there must be some energy, some vital, spiritus, chi, whatever you call it, that fundamentally makes living things different than nonliving things. %$* 237
but over the next 100, 150 years, basically the 19th into the 20th century, we discovered biochemistry and genetics and developmental biology, and all different principles of biology, until essentially there was nothing left for the life force to do. %$* 237
we had explained everything that living organisms do, and we explored the blurry line between living and nonliving, and we realized that there is no fundamental difference there. %$* 237
it's just, as you get increased complexity at some point you cross this fuzzy line, and you're doing a process that we call "life." well, we're kind of going through the same process though maybe a little bit delayed with consciousness. %$* 237
you-- %$* 237
we understand that the brain causes consciousness. %$* 237
we certainly don't understand a lot about how it is produced exactly. %$* 237
but we're making progress. %$* 237
our research paradigms are working quite well, thank you, and we're making lots of progress. %$* 237
it's just as irrational, if you will, to hypothesize that there is some magical energy or some non-corporeal thing, stuff, that is consciousness, as it was 200 years ago to say that, "well, because we can't explain life, then we need a life force." we don't need a brain force, a mind force any more than we needed a life force 200 years ago. %$* 237
the fact is that the neuroscientific community is progressing relentlessly with the paradigm that is materialist, reductionist. %$* 237
we're looking for neuroanatomical correlates of everything that the mind does, and that research program is very, very successful. %$* 237
and it-- %$* 237
how well an idea advances in science is more telling about how valuable it is, how true it is, than what our current state of knowledge is. %$* 237
our current state of knowledge is always going to be incomplete. %$* 237
it doesn't mean that our ideas are wrong or are weak. %$* 237
that's why you have to vote against this proposition. %$* 237
thank you, steven novella. %$* 13
and the proposition is, "death is not final." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion that "death is not final," raymond moody, he's a medical doctor and author of the book, "life after life," in which he coined the term, "near-death experience." raymond moody. %$* 13
first of all, i want to say that to me to this day the notion of life after death is very counterintuitive. %$* 235
i think as a nonreligious person i had no background in that. %$* 235
it never occurred to me, as a young astronomy buff, that there might be something beyond this. %$* 235
i've been through a process now of 40+ years that finally drove me into this situation where i'm sort of forced to say, almost against my will, that "death is not final," there is a life after death. %$* 235
basically what happened to me was that hearing thousands of people with near-death experiences, hundreds of people with shared death experiences who had the identical experience we call a near-death experience, except they weren't ill or injured, they were simply there at the bedside of someone else who died, and i have seen joint transcendent experiences where, for example, a physician and a critically ill patient would have some sort of joint transcendent experience at the same time. %$* 235
that leads me to be forced almost into a position to say that i trust these people's judgment. %$* 235
it seems to me that they've been somewhere where i haven't been, and i can begin to put a little picture together of what they're talking about. %$* 235
so for that reason i would say i'm onboard. %$* 235
i think there is life after death. %$* 235
so vote, vote, vote for the afterlife. %$* 235
and-- %$* 235
thank you, raymond moody. %$* 13
our motion is, "death is not final," and here to summarize his position against the motion, sean carroll. %$* 13
he's a theoretical physicist at the california institute of technology and author of, "the particle at the end of the universe." %$* 13
when i was about six years old, i had an emotional formative experience that apparently many other people share similar things. %$* 236
i was in bed, you know, going to sleep, sort of thinking about the day and so forth, and i started crying. %$* 236
i was just bawling uncontrollably, so much so that my mom heard me from her bedroom and came running in, saying, "what is wrong? %$* 236
" and i said, "some day, our grandmom is going to die. %$* 236
and someday, you're going to die. %$* 236
and someday, i'm going to die. %$* 236
we're all going to die."and you know, she had to explain, "well, yes." and so forth. %$* 236
and she had her own version of the story. %$* 236
and the reason i'm telling this story because even as convinced as i am that death is final, i have absolutely no desire to belittle the people in the room who disagree, who feel the other way. %$* 236
this is an incredibly important, central issue to our lives. %$* 236
i personally am convinced by the overwhelming scientific evidence from physics, from neuroscience, et cetera, that there is one world, the natural world. %$* 236
biology is a process that can end. %$* 236
and death is final. %$* 236
and to me, that fact-- %$* 236
the finitude of our lives-- %$* 236
gives enormous poignancy and importance to the finite number of years that we have here on earth. %$* 236
our lives here are not dress rehearsals. %$* 236
this is the act. %$* 236
this is the one performance that we get. %$* 236
that does not remove meaning or value from the lives we're leading now. %$* 236
it gives-- %$* 236
it forces us to give meaning to everything we do, because we only have a finite number of things to do. %$* 236
if evidence came in on the other side, i would change my mind quickly, if the evidence was good enough. %$* 236
but i think that we're past the point where it's a scientifically interesting question. %$* 236
i think that we know enough to conclude that death is final. %$* 236
and personally, i think that that is okay. %$* 236
thank you. %$* 236
thank you. %$* 13
sean caroll. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you to go again to the keypads at your seats and vote for the second time. %$* 13
and it will be the difference between the first and second vote by you, our audience members here in new york, that will determine our winner. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have changed the most will be the team that wins. %$* 13
our motion is death is not final. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
are we good? %$* 13
we can lock out the system. %$* 13
which numbers? %$* 18
oh, numbers are the same as before. %$* 13
if you are for the motion, push #1. if you are against the motion, push #2. and if you became or remain undecided, push #3. and you can ignore the other-- %$* 13
the other keys. %$* 13
the other numbers are nothing. %$* 13
i'll give it another 15 seconds. %$* 13
and my apologies for that. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's good. %$* 13
so, while we're waiting for the calculation to come in, i just want to say this. %$* 13
you know, sean caroll just made the point in his closing statement very, very brilliantly, about-- %$* 13
this is not a debate that in any way was meant to disrespect anybody. %$* 13
and in fact, that would go very much against the spirit of intelligence squared, which-- %$* 13
it's goal is to raise the level of public discourse. %$* 13
and what i heard, not only from sean carroll, but from all four of these debaters, were four people who disagreed vehemently on something very personal, meaningful, and metaphysical. %$* 13
and yet, they did it in a respectful way. %$* 13
and i have to really give them a round of applause for the way they did that. %$* 13
and also, to everybody who asked a question, including the questions we didn't take-- %$* 13
it takes a lot of guts to get up in front of an audience and ask questions. %$* 13
some of them were terrific and the other ones were just darn interesting. %$* 13
and i think it might sell some more books for eben alexander, but to everybody who got up and asked a question, thanks very much for doing it. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
we would love to have you tweet about the debate. %$* 13
as i said at the beginning, our hashtag tonight is #afterdeath. %$* 13
that-- %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us.and this was our final debate of our spring season. %$* 13
we-- %$* 13
this was debate #91, i think, that we've put on since bob rosenkranz started this thing. %$* 13
and it was a new zig-zag for us. %$* 13
i think it went really well. %$* 13
it was very interesting. %$* 13
a little metaphysical for a night out in new york. %$* 13
i mean, if this is anybody's first date, you're probably-- %$* 13
it's probably going to stick for a while. %$* 13
we're doing a debate, though-- %$* 13
the national constitutional center-- %$* 13
constitution center in philadelphia next month, our second time going there. %$* 13
and we're going to be looking at the question of whether independent political speech is the linchpin of our democracy, or is it its achilles heel? %$* 13
we're looking at the question of the ability of individuals and organizations to influence campaigns through campaign spending and whether the constitution actually presents that expenditure as a matter of the first amendment. %$* 13
tickets to that will be available through our website, wwwiq2us.org. %$* 13
and we are going to be announcing our fall lineup soon. %$* 13
we'll be back here at the kaufman center, and the debates for that are in tonight's program. %$* 13
on the list of topics that we're considering, "income inequality," "assisted suicide," "genetically modified food," "cybersecurity," "privacy," "monogamy," "climate engineering," "the private lives of public figures," and "google glass." so those of you who can't join the debate, of course we are on fora.tv and on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so i have the results all in. %$* 13
remember, we had you vote twice on this motion, "death is not final," once before the debate and once again after the debate, and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
in the first vote, "death is not final," 37 percent agreed with that, 31 percent disagreed with that, 32 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
now, the second vote-- %$* 13
remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most will be the winner-- %$* 13
in the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 42 percent. %$* 13
they went from 37 percent to 42 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 5 percentage points. %$* 13
the team against the motion, now-- %$* 13
5 percentage points is the number to beat-- %$* 13
the team against the motion-- %$* 13
they went-- %$* 13
their first vote was 31 percent, their second vote was 46 percent. %$* 13
that's up 15 percent. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion "death is not final," has won this debate. %$* 13
basically saying, "death is final," sorry. %$* 13
thanks very much, everyone. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared. %$* 13
we'll see you next time. %$* 13

so the question is, why is this going to happen? %$* 391
and essentially the cbo scores in a very static way. %$* 391
it listens to what the administration says about the number of dollars they're going to spend and the cost for particular jobs, and it thinks that economics is a form of multiplication and subtraction and addition. %$* 391
the problem is the money has to come from somewhere. %$* 391
and the basic tradeoff that you have is this: if in fact you decide to run this thing through a stimulus program, you must raise taxes. %$* 391
if you raise them, as is now proposed on the most productive individuals in society, it turns out that you're taking money from the hands of people who know how to use it and to put it into the hands of a government which simply does not. %$* 391
so the prediction is, at this particular time, what will happen is exactly the same thing that happened before. %$* 391
there will be a short-term burst, and then magically, there will be another earthquake, and the program will fail. %$* 391
okay. %$* 13
cecilia rouse, i'd like you to respond. %$* 13
there were a bunch of points in there, including don't trust the cbo, i think. %$* 13
never. %$* 391
never trust the cbo. %$* 13
percent unemployment. %$* 17
that wasn't the cbo. %$* 17
yeah, that wasn't the cbo. %$* 390
well, who did? %$* 391
did you? %$* 391
cecilia. %$* 13
but richard's point about these programs remove money from people who make the best use of it and give it to those who don't, can you take that on? %$* 13
well, you know, there is a theory in public finance that says that you shouldn't have a very high marginal tax rate on the very highest earners. %$* 390
but if you actually look at the-- %$* 390
in our experience over time, there's not a great relationship between the highest marginal tax rates and how we're doing in terms of economic growth. %$* 390
if you look at reagan, he lowered tax rates for high income individuals. %$* 390
clinton increased them. %$* 390
and you saw somewhat greater economic growth under clinton than under reagan. %$* 390
so i think the evidence tells us that, yes, there is-- %$* 390
these are tax rates. %$* 390
so i'm not going to say that there's no impact at all in terms of lowering economic growth, et cetera. %$* 390
but it's very small for the highest earners because they don't spend the tax cuts. %$* 390
and it doesn't have that big of an impact on their earnings. %$* 390
you know, some have looked at what some of the highest paid ceos did with their tax cuts. %$* 390
some of them, it's true. %$* 390
they exercised stock options creatively and strategically. %$* 390
but in terms of their general income, which is really the income-generating activity, there was really no impact. %$* 390
so i actually think that this is-- %$* 390
i think it's a small tax increase today, but-- %$* 390
not today, it's in a couple of years, and that it'll be at a time when the economy can actually sustain it. %$* 390
daniel mitchell. %$* 13
well, a couple of points. %$* 389
one good thing about being a libertarian is i don't have to respect the cbo because cbo, like a lot of the keynesian models, they presuppose their results. %$* 389
it's just a mathematical formula. %$* 389
if the mathematical formula is wrong, if they automatically assume that if the government increases spending by x, the economy goes up by y, and they never pay attention to the fact that while the economy actually went down by z, they say, well, it would have gone down by more than z if it wasn't for the government spending. %$* 389
so it's sort of this perpetual motion machine of economics. %$* 389
the white house in 2009 said if you pass the so-called stimulus, the unemployment rate will never rise above eight percent. %$* 389
and instead, it's never dropped below nine percent. %$* 389
let me just fact check you to the other side. %$* 13
is that accurate? %$* 13
cecilia rouse. %$* 13
that-- %$* 390
okay. %$* 390
so that wasn't the white house. %$* 390
that was a transition paper by christina romer and jared bernstein. %$* 390
okay. %$* 389
so-- %$* 389
but you have to remember-- %$* 390
the head of the council of economic advisors. %$* 389
no. %$* 390
we weren't at the cea at that point. %$* 390
but here is-- %$* 390
but the person who wound up there. %$* 389
okay. %$* 390
so here is the point about that number, though, right? %$* 390
there's always a counter factual. %$* 390
and as it turned out, they generated that estimate based on what they knew at the time which was in december 2008. as it turned out, the economy was a lot sicker than what they even knew. %$* 390
well, the unemployment rate was higher when they did the forecast. %$* 389
it was. %$* 390
exactly. %$* 390
they didn't know it. %$* 389
so in other words, that's-- %$* 389
the krugman is that no matter how much keynesianism fails, you just should have spent more money. %$* 389
but that's what gets you eventually to becoming greece. %$* 389
there is no way to-- %$* 391
they keep spending more money. %$* 389
richard epstein. %$* 13
there's no way to falsify that proposition because if things go better, the stimulus did it. %$* 391
if things go worse, they would have been even worse still. %$* 391
so the question is, why do we believe when we've had a system of stagnation, when what you propose are short- term stimulus, which by definition will drop off. %$* 391
these are not going to have long-term benefits. %$* 391
you're eating your seed corn. %$* 391
remember, tax revenues are down to an all- time low. %$* 391
government expenditure is to a high. %$* 391
you now have 40 percent of the budget which is being financed by deficits. %$* 391
and the question is, how long is that going to be sustainable? %$* 391
there is an optimism in your position that somehow or other we can go from short-term stuff to long-term stuff, and yet there's no explanation as to how that transition is to be made-- %$* 391
and, mark, richard is also making the point that you really can't prove your claims for stimulus spending having worked, because as he says, you're saying, well, it would have been worse if they hadn't. %$* 13
so what-- %$* 13
i can’t counter-factual. %$* 17
i mean, we can't prove the counter-factual. %$* 17
but where does that put you in terms of your argument? %$* 13
and winning that argument is a big thing %$* 13
well, i tried to make my case with respect to timing. %$* 17
i mean, that's more obvious, right? %$* 17
so february '09, the stimulus, the one that we're focused on, most people are focused on, passed. %$* 17
it was mid february '09, i believe. %$* 17
in february '09, we lost literally 750,000 jobs. %$* 17
we lost 750,000 jobs in january, we lost 750,000 job in march. %$* 17
the economy was shrinking rapidly. %$* 17
we were in a free fall. %$* 17
by june, the recession was over, not by my definition, by the national bureau for economic research. %$* 17
by one year later, we were having job growth. %$* 17
so, okay, you could argue maybe the economy magically would have found its footing without help from the federal government. %$* 17
and i'm not saying stimulus was the only thing. %$* 17
there were many policy responses. %$* 17
there was the federal reserve. %$* 17
there were the tarp programs. %$* 17
there were lots of different things. %$* 17
we know-- %$* 391
but i think it's fair to say, just given the chronology of events, that the stimulus had a very positive impact. %$* 17
the economy would have performed measurably worse. %$* 17
no, because at the same time, you have to-- %$* 391
richard epstein. %$* 13
predict that the stimulus also would fizzle. %$* 391
and that's exactly what it did. %$* 391
so in other words, there are two ways to look at this. %$* 391
what you do is you give people a boost of adrenaline, and they start running furiously. %$* 391
and then you've depleted their future resources, and there's nothing left to recoup. %$* 391
and the question here is long-term sustainability. %$* 391
as cecilia said, if you're worried about labor markets, keep people out at the beginning, and it's going to affect them for the rest of their lives. %$* 391
and so what i don't understand is why don't you take up the proposals to deregulate the labor markets to increase the expansions from gains from trade? %$* 391
okay, can i respond? %$* 17
yeah. %$* 13
mark zandi. %$* 13
i concur. %$* 17
i concur. %$* 17
i agree with you entirely that the stimulus efforts are not a source of long-term growth. %$* 17
they are not. %$* 17
they were never intended to be. %$* 17
they were to provide support to the economy in a time of crisis, when we were in free fall. %$* 17
but we also need policies, like the ones you're talking about. %$* 17
and we can discuss the merits of it, where we need to focus on regulatory policy. %$* 17
we need to focus on tax policy. %$* 17
and most importantly of all, we need to focus on our long-term fiscal %$* 17
so you're saying that jobs plan is the fire truck rushing from the fire house right now. %$* 13
that's exactly what it is. %$* 17
if you had asked me to come to this debate six months ago when the economy was-- %$* 17
we were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs a month, i'd say, "john, i'm not coming." %$* 17
yeah, but can i ask you-- %$* 391
but i-- %$* 17
you know, and i'm not a hard-- %$* 17
keynesian theory works at specific points in time. %$* 17
it's not an immutable fact. %$* 17
it doesn't work in every environment. %$* 17
all right, dan-- %$* 13
this is an environment where-- %$* 17
wait, wait, richard, let's-- %$* 13
richard, let your opponent have the mic for a minute. %$* 13
daniel, can you respond to the point that mark just made, that sometimes at specific points in times it works. %$* 13
in your remarks earlier, you said pretty much i think that it never works. %$* 13
well, if you take a long-term view and not just cherry-pick an odd month here or there, and you go back in time, and you look at different countries where they have tried keynesianism, it hasn't worked. %$* 389
and one of the most interesting periods is when we didn't try keynesianism. %$* 389
the recession coming out of world war i was very steep. %$* 389
we didn't do anything. %$* 389
the economy recovered very rapidly. %$* 389
and probably even more interesting is what happened after world war ii. %$* 389
all the keynesians thought we were going to have a giant recession. %$* 389
they wanted to plan massive public work spending and things like that. %$* 389
but republicans control congress. %$* 389
we had gridlock, we had stalemate. %$* 389
that turned out to be a wonderful thing. %$* 389
because government didn't do anything and the economy relatively quickly digested millions and millions of people of being demobilized from war. %$* 389
in other words, the hippocratic oath about do no harm i think really applies, not to mention the fact that at some point we should consider why do we get recessions in the first place which in many cases is because of government policy mistakes, housing subsidies, easy money policy by the fed, and things like that. %$* 389
right, but-- %$* 13
you're welcome to-- %$* 13
you don't have to suppress stuff. %$* 13
it sounded so timid and halfhearted. %$* 13
i want the other side to respond. %$* 13
you just gave us an incident in which you said there was a recession without stimulus, and there was a terrific comeback, and that proves-- %$* 13
that establishes that at least in that instance, if we're going to talk about specific situations, that it-- %$* 13
you can get out of it without this kind of program, and i'd like this side to respond to that. %$* 13
well, you mean-- %$* 17
okay. %$* 17
you're going to drag me into the 1950s? %$* 17
a little bit. %$* 13
okay, all right, okay, fair enough. %$* 17
i don't agree with that interpretation-- %$* 17
well you know what, let cecilia-- %$* 13
no. %$* 390
i actually don't want to speak to this specific point, but i-- %$* 390
all right, no, no-- %$* 13
i want-- %$* 13
i just to that point. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the 1950s were actually a pretty difficult period. %$* 17
now, i'm not arguing that stimulus would've been the right – that big public works project would've been the right response to that, but, you know, the '50s weren't the greatest decade. %$* 17
it was-- %$* 17
i'm talking about the 1940s, though. %$* 389
well, you said after the recession-- %$* 17
i mean, after the war, world war ii ended in 1945, and then that period-- %$* 17
then we had the korean war which was a lot of fiscal stimulus, and then the 1950s was a period of really no growth. %$* 17
in fact, we had three recessions in the 1950s, and it was a very difficult time. %$* 17
so i don't know, maybe. %$* 17
that's stretching the limits of my historical experience, but-- %$* 17
and i know in our recent history, stimuluses work quite well, and in the most recent period, it's been highly successful. %$* 17
richard epstein, what-- %$* 13
the president's plan also calls for putting investment into jobs that would rebuild highways, and bridges, and airports, and waterways, all of which, you know, it's clear we need, what's wrong with that? %$* 13
there's nothing wrong with doing it so long as you do it correctly and so long as you do it systematically, and what's happened is, of course, with the rise of the transfer society, there's been a systematic neglect of infrastructure. %$* 391
and so clearly money has to go there, but if you look at this particular statute and the elaborate hoops that you have to go through, it is not a bill which is designed to promote infrastructure. %$* 391
it is a bill which is designed to make sure that the president's supporters, strong union members get jobs which will allow them to contribute to the campaign to win. %$* 391
the difference between this particular-- %$* 391
well, i'm glad to see that you all approve. %$* 391
but if you look at this program as against for example, the wpa, the administrative overlay that you have here is very, very much higher, and if you look at the way in which this relates to the employment jobs, the last stimulus program that was designed to deal with infrastructure was capital intensive and labeled weak, so that it had absolutely nothing to do, whatsoever, with jobs. %$* 391
so my own view about this is the infrastructure question should be handled on its own merits. %$* 391
it should not be bundled in with the stimulus bill, and once you get that right, if you look at this particular bill with its new and it's four for the president, and three for the other side, that's the last thing that you want to have running this kind of program. %$* 391
cecilia rouse, could you-- %$* 13
i know you want to get to another point and i'll come back to that, but can you respond to-- %$* 13
yeah, you know, first of all-- %$* 390
look, i'm not a regulatory law expert, but my understanding is at least some of the provisions, such as the buy american provisions and the davis bacon, applied to infrastructure projects without this bill, meaning they've been in statute for decades since the 1930s as you mentioned-- %$* 390
and that's why we should get rid of it. %$* 391
well-- %$* 390
but that would mean that in order for this bill to get rid of them, that would be something new in this bill. %$* 390
and so we could argue about the merits or not, but really all this bill is doing is making it consistent with current law. %$* 390
yes, but the-- %$* 391
the agencies know how to administrate them, it doesn't add an additional administrative burden, but like i said, we could argue the merits of it, but i think that, that's not really the main purpose of the bill. %$* 390
when you have failed policies, you try to change them. %$* 391
you're arguing for consistency, and i think that's fine, but if you're doing this as sort of an academic debate, the question is consistency, meaning getting rid of it across the board or keeping it across the board. %$* 391
and the question is-- %$* 391
that dan put to you is how do we figure out, in theory, which way we want to go, and here's one simple device. %$* 391
if you don't know what you're doing, don't spend government money to do it. %$* 391
and these things are highly problematic, completely protectionist, and so, therefore, their elimination is something which is a matter of first principle should want, not only here, but in all the other bills. %$* 391
davis bacon is a public outrage, and there's no reason why we ought to extend it. %$* 391
cecilia, what was the question you wanted to bring up before? %$* 13
the point that i was going to bring up earlier was more about how do we judge the value of stimulus and of the recovery act. %$* 390
and i really just wanted to say, "look, as richard pointed out, the problem here is that we're trying to argue about a counterfactual, but i'm really sympathetic to-- %$* 390
can you translate, "we are trying to argue about a counterfactual-- %$* 13
about a counterfactual meaning. %$* 390
okay we passed the stimulus. %$* 390
and the way we will judge whether a policy is effective, we say what would have happened had we not done so. %$* 390
so we passed it. %$* 390
i don’t yet have a time machine. %$* 390
president doesn’t have a time machine, so we can’t go back and unpass it and see what would have happened had we not passed it. %$* 390
therefore what economists have to do is try to say, try to create that counterfactual, what would have happened in its absence. %$* 390
okay, i’m very sympathetic to the keynesian multipliers, just sort of mindlessly applying the multiplier and saying what would happen. %$* 390
which means what? %$* 13
which means that economists have estimated okay, if we spend this much on infrastructure spending, then it’s going to chug through the economy and we’re going to get this much out and it’s going to create this much employment. %$* 390
and that’s their way of doing a counterfactual in a sense. %$* 390
i’m a micro-economist. %$* 390
my job is, i do a lot in education, it’s to do a lot of evaluation of programs, so that doesn’t make sense to me. %$* 390
but what does make sense to me, is that there’re some economists that have not taken that route but have said instead, well can we compare the outgrowth of, or the employment growth in states where they’ve got more money, or in localities where they got more money than in others. %$* 390
now, you might worry that okay, well but why did some get more money than others. %$* 390
maybe you got more money because you were doing more poorly. %$* 390
they’ve tried to adjust for that in very creative and credible ways i might add. %$* 390
and this is not by economists that were working for the obama administration or really had a dog in the hunt. %$* 390
and what they find is, it was actually fairly positive as well. %$* 390
so i’m fairly convinced that not just with one methodology do we find that the stimulus made a difference, but using a variety of them. %$* 390
will we ever know for sure? %$* 390
no. %$* 390
i can see that because i think that’s what my business-- %$* 390
we have to be humble about that. %$* 390
it seems to be down on the other side, that you will never know for sure that it doesn’t work in the same way that they’re saying for sure that it does work. %$* 13
well that’s why i made my remarks during, about economists having a little bit of humility because we’re trying to predict things that are fundamentally-- %$* 389
we’ll never know the right answer. %$* 389
we’ll be debating, we’ll all be 80 years old up here having the same debate. %$* 389
but i do think looking at history, looking at periods where we tried keynesianism versus periods when we didn’t, i think there is a pattern there that supports the negative proposition in this debate. %$* 389
also, you look at countries around the world during this recent economic downturn. %$* 389
it’s been fairly global. %$* 389
counties that were much less keynesian in their approach, like germany and canada, seem to do better than countries that were more keynesian in their approach like the united kingdom and the united states. %$* 389
but again, there are 50 different policies out there and we’re trying to focus on just the narrow issue of fiscal policy. %$* 389
and so it really is a challenge. %$* 389
and i think all of us up here want america to be more profitable and have more jobs. %$* 389
so i think we all start from the same goal, but it really is difficult to figure out what’s going to work. %$* 389
but i do look at europe and the fact that they’ve gone down this path of deficit spending and it really does seem to eventually lead you into a cul-de-sac. %$* 389
and they’re in very serious trouble. %$* 389
and i worry about, i have three kids, i don’t want america to be like greece in 15 or 20 years. %$* 389
all right, i’m going to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
can i just make one point? %$* 390
let me just do this, and then while the mic’s are moving, you can make your point, are you cool with that? %$* 13
sure. %$* 390
so, what will happen is, if you raise your hand, i’ll find you and a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
we ask you to stand up and tell us your name and then ask a question that is focused, terse, on point, and really is a question. %$* 13
and no two parters or three parters. %$* 13
and also what doesn’t work is, i’d like to hear every member of the panel tell me their list of because it would just take up too much time. %$* 13
so those are the questions that i’ll have to throw out, so i just want you to think about that. %$* 13
and while you’re getting ready, cecilia. %$* 13
i just wanted to thank dan for bringing up germany and canada. %$* 390
because, one of the reasons why many people believe that, especially germany, which had a larger, or germany did not suffer the same employment losses that we did and many people have asked why. %$* 390
and canada as well, and both of them have work sharing programs, which were very active. %$* 390
so many people believe, and again if you ask german economists what exactly explains it, you’ll get many answers. %$* 390
but one of the reasons is because german employers were not obligated to try to adjust to the downturn by laying off all of their workers. %$* 390
that’s a lot of the reason why the president actually was looking to germany and we’ve been trying to expand our own work sharing program for exactly this reason. %$* 390
you could do work share programs voluntarily without government intervention. %$* 391
okay, let’s go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
yeah, yes sir. %$* 13
remember the rules. %$* 13
daniel. %$* 392
can you tell us who you are? %$* 13
my name's robin yellen %$* 392
thank you. %$* 13
you mentioned just now that, to me the whole argument is stimulus, no stimulus, this is basically what it sounds like to me. %$* 392
now, you’ve mentioned earlier that in, after the first world war, there was a recession, but america survived it, and everything came right. %$* 392
after the second world war, the same thing. %$* 392
but after two world wars, countries were in situations where they had to build. %$* 392
they had to rebuild. %$* 392
they had to restructure everything. %$* 392
and that, to me, is what president obama is proposing, is the restructuring, building again to get things going. %$* 392
do you not think that's-- %$* 392
that was a stimulus all on its own? %$* 392
thank you. %$* 13
dan mitchell. %$* 13
if i understand your question correctly, no, i don't. %$* 389
the reason i pointed out the recession of 1920, which, if we didn't have the great depression that would have been viewed as our great depression because the macroeconomic numbers were absolutely terrible then, worse than anything we had ever experienced. %$* 389
and politicians didn't do anything, and the economy quickly recovered. %$* 389
we've always had downturns. %$* 389
and the question is how quickly do we get out of the downturn, what malinvestments and economic mistakes were made, and did the economy have the ability to quickly adjust? %$* 389
my concern about stimulus, if you define stimulus by government involvement and intervention, i think it hinders and retards the economy's ability to adjust and to sort of digest the mistake that caused resources to be misallocated. %$* 389
and i think what's happening today, not only under obama, but also under bush, we have gotten to a point where government is so big, so-- %$* 389
you know, just involved in all sectors of the economy, not just spending and taxes, but regulations and intervention, the types of thing richard was talking about. %$* 389
we have moved to a lower growth level that we may be stuck with permanently in the same way that europeans have had these, for decades now, slower rates of economic growth. %$* 389
okay. %$* 13
and that's what's important to me. %$* 389
along the right side. %$* 13
oh, i thought i saw a bunch of hands go up there. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
right in the center here. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
if you look to your right, i think it'll come faster. %$* 13
my name is gene epstein. %$* 393
a question for those who support the proposal. %$* 393
if there is indeed a crying need for jobs right now, and if there are indeed structural problems in the economy, partly caused by government right now, that could be altered, wouldn't you want to pick up on richard epstein's proposal right now to address those problems so that we can have job creation, such as the harassment of boeing, the greater-- %$* 393
okay. %$* 13
strength in %$* 393
i'm going to stop you there because you-- %$* 13
and so on. %$* 393
you actually asked a perfect question, and so mark zandi, do you want to take that on? %$* 13
hi, gene. %$* 17
how are you? %$* 17
good to see you. %$* 17
i recognize the voice. %$* 17
yeah. %$* 17
we haven't talked in a while. %$* 17
please give me a call, gene. %$* 17
yeah. %$* 17
you don't return my calls, zandi. %$* 393
oh, yeah, yeah. %$* 17
i return everybody's call. %$* 17
i think i would do both. %$* 17
i think cece said it nicely. %$* 17
you know, policy makers can walk and chew gum at the same time. %$* 17
and we need to do that. %$* 17
i do sympathize with a lot of the points that are being made with respect to regulatory policy and government intervention. %$* 17
i do think some of the policy steps have created uncertainty for businesses and for the banking system. %$* 17
and that's impaired the ability and willingness of businesses to step up and hire and for banks to lend. %$* 17
so i sympathize with that perspective. %$* 17
and i think we need to work on policies to address that. %$* 17
but that does not preclude the fact that we need to reduce some of the fiscal restraint that's dead ahead of us. %$* 17
if we don't make some policy steps here, taxes are going to rise on everybody. %$* 17
unemployment insurance for many hard-pressed households are going to expire. %$* 17
and that's the prescription for a recession. %$* 17
all right. %$* 13
now speaking of right now, i want to mention our media partner in these debates is slate. %$* 13
and in fact we're being live-streamed on slate right now. %$* 13
so to everybody who's watching on slate, welcome. %$* 13
and thanks for being with us. %$* 13
and we've asked you to submit questions. %$* 13
and there's a "right now" type of question, or its reverse from a rhonda dubose-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, from a darin clements in williamsburg, missouri, who asks, since the jobs bill is basically a temporary funding program, what are-- %$* 13
what are the prospects for this actually having an impact on long-term employment? %$* 13
are we really talking about jobs, or are we only talking about getting money into the system for stimulus? %$* 13
are people really going to be better employed in the long term as a result of this program? %$* 13
can i-- %$* 17
cecilia rouse. %$* 13
yeah, please. %$* 390
here's the-- %$* 17
this is what i worry about. %$* 17
i think our economy has made significant progress in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess. %$* 17
we've reduced debt. %$* 17
the businesses are in very good shape financially. %$* 17
households have made a lot of progress. %$* 17
there's work to be done. %$* 17
we've got foreclosure issues. %$* 17
the banking system is recapitalized. %$* 17
we've made significant progress. %$* 17
we're on the verge of a much better economy. %$* 17
but if we go back into recession, all that good, hard work is going to go down the tubes. %$* 17
and this is going to cost us enormously. %$* 17
we go into recession, revenues are going to fall because there's going to be fewer people employed. %$* 17
government spending's going to rise because there's automatic spending increases in our budget. %$* 17
people become unemployed, they'll go get unemployment insurance. %$* 17
it's going to cost us more than this package, a lot more than this package. %$* 17
so it's not only about the very near term. %$* 17
it's about the long run. %$* 17
we can't take that chance. %$* 17
if we go into recession, it's going to undermine the fundamentals of our economy. %$* 17
mark, the question is a little bit different. %$* 13
it's about people actually having-- %$* 13
having jobs, having careers, if you will, being able to count on this going forward. %$* 13
and your opponents have argued that one of the problems they see with this, particularly something like-- %$* 13
like the tax holiday that's being offered to employers, it's a holiday, then it ends. %$* 13
and it's so short term that there's no real incentive for a company to hire workers. %$* 13
but this is the point, john. %$* 17
this is-- %$* 17
let me try one more time. %$* 17
listen, if we go back into recession, all those fundamentals of our economy are going to erode. %$* 17
all the good things, all the progress we've made is going is go away, and it's going to hurt the ability of businesses to hire and people to get jobs for the long run, for a long time to come. %$* 17
we are running the risk of going into a japanese-like decade if we go back in a recession in six to nine months. %$* 17
we just can't allow that to happen. %$* 17
but the difficulty-- %$* 391
richard epstein. %$* 13
with that is you can go into recession in 16 to 18 months. %$* 391
and you're talking about the short-term disasters. %$* 391
what about the midterm disasters? %$* 391
the advantage of the deregulation on the labor market side, which could be quite big, getting rid of industrial policies, no more cylinders and so forth, is that has an effect today. %$* 391
it has a long-term effect. %$* 391
it reduces the size of government burdens, and it increases the gains from potential hiring of labor. %$* 391
so i'm going to ask you, mark, just plain out, if you're in favor of this bill. %$* 391
would you get rid of the davis bacon provision and the-- %$* 391
and the arra provision and the unemployment discrimination provision? %$* 391
i think the answer's got to be yes. %$* 391
this gets to the question of political economy. %$* 17
we have no time left. %$* 17
but you are-- %$* 391
wait, wait, wait. %$* 17
if you want-- %$* 17
you asked me a question. %$* 17
i'm going to answer it. %$* 17
if we go down that path of trying to repeal these laws that have been in statute since 1930, we'll be debating this 10 years from now. %$* 17
and we're toast. %$* 17
that's not the-- %$* 391
so in-- %$* 17
and here's the other point. %$* 17
and i'm going to ask you a question. %$* 17
of $450 billion in the package-- %$* 17
what? %$* 391
$450 billion package. %$* 17
how much of that is subject to the statutes that you are concerned about by america? %$* 17
a fair-- %$* 391
no. %$* 17
how much, exactly? %$* 17
i don't know the exact number. %$* 391
$50 billion. %$* 17
okay. %$* 391
50 out of the 450 billion. %$* 17
okay. %$* 391
let's get-- %$* 391
do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. %$* 17
let's go back to the other point. %$* 391
i read the statute as well. %$* 17
no, no, no. %$* 391
that may be for the arra provisions. %$* 391
you've got the davis bacon provisions. %$* 391
you've got the employment discrimination provisions. %$* 391
which and so i'm not asking you to repeal the statutes as they exist everywhere else. %$* 391
i'm asking you not to put them in this particular bill. %$* 391
we're going piece by piece. %$* 391
will you get rid of these pieces? %$* 391
you don't have to repeal anything. %$* 391
you don't have to have a long-term debate. %$* 391
all you have to say is, not with this one now. %$* 391
and all you've told me is you don't think it's going to do a lot of good. %$* 391
i'm going to tell you it's going to do at least some harm. %$* 391
and spending nothing on this is a lot better than trying to say, we have to tie the two things together. %$* 391
you know it's a political fix. %$* 391
i know it's a political fix. %$* 391
cecilia rouse. %$* 13
just disentangle. %$* 391
cecilia rouse. %$* 13
i just wanted to say something about the anti-discrimination provision. %$* 390
and take one minute-- %$* 13
to say what it is. %$* 390
not even a minute, 15 seconds to remind us what this is about. %$* 13
i was going to do that. %$* 390
so many employers have actually been having their ads, when they post for employment, they say, "if you are unemployed, you need not apply." we'll not consider-- %$* 390
or you must currently have a job. %$* 390
so many employers have this in statute-- %$* 390
or not in statute, but they have that in their ads. %$* 390
and as a result, many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive to employment growth. %$* 390
so, i understand that employers are being inundated with applications and with applicants. %$* 390
there are over four unemployed workers for every job opening. %$* 390
and employers are having to find ways to really sift through. %$* 390
and i also understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire, who they think is the best match. %$* 390
but let's think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest of society, which is where i think we have a place for government intervention. %$* 390
first of all, imagine you're an unemployed worker. %$* 390
especially imagine you're an unemployed worker who's been unemployed for at least six months. %$* 390
so you're actually bordering on discouraged. %$* 390
i actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is-- %$* 390
you know, marginally thinks she's not very attractive to employers. %$* 390
you understand that employers are putting out these ads, you don't even try to get a job. %$* 390
and the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying, from even applying for jobs. %$* 390
so one is i think it discourages workers from even trying to get hired. %$* 390
the second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs. %$* 390
we have a lot of dynamism in our labor market, and one of the problems we have right now is actually because of the labor market, we have fewer quits than we normally would have, and as a result, workers are staying in jobs, they're not quitting, and so they're not going to be climbing up the career ladder. %$* 390
it's a negative spillover to the rest of society. %$* 390
okay, cecilia, let me stop you there for some response-- %$* 13
you know, look, i mean-- %$* 391
dan miller, please-- %$* 13
richard, let dan miller come in. %$* 13
mitchell, but that-- %$* 389
i'm-- %$* 13
but i'll go by miller. %$* 389
no, there is no miller here, dan mitchell. %$* 13
i want to make a point that some of you should get ready to hiss about because i think this point makes perfect sense but some people don't like it, employers only hire people that they think is going to make them money. %$* 389
and so, therefore, when we're considering what is going to increase-- %$* 389
oh, you're ruining my fun by clapping instead of hissing-- %$* 389
so when we're thinking about what in terms of like the boots on the ground type issue, what is going to convince companies to hire workers? %$* 389
if you create a new potential legal liability with new government rules about how you're writing your want ads and who you're allowed to hire and what you're allowed to say when you're interviewing, is that going to increase or decrease the likelihood that companies are going to want to hire new people? %$* 389
we want workers to be an asset to firms, not a liability, and this gets into of course all the other policies about what are the-- %$* 389
if we lower tax rates, will that help? %$* 389
if we reduce government regulation of red tape, will that help? %$* 389
i think markets, i think copying hong kong is a better idea than copying france. %$* 389

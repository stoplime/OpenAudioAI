i want to go to the team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
and i found one part of the arguments that you made-- %$* 13
i found there was something missing that i expected your argument to include, which was tell us if in any way a college adjudication process actually has advantages for the victim over the court system. %$* 13
is-- %$* 13
in what way is it more victim focused or more victim friendly, if you will? %$* 13
what's the advantage? %$* 13
what are the advantages for the victim if it's a college tribunal situation? %$* 13
either of you can take it. %$* 13
michelle anderson. %$* 13
well, the college system has the advantage that it's not the police, and the public record of the-- %$* 319
well, i got that because you-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah. %$* 319
you made it clear that-- %$* 13
right. %$* 319
you-- %$* 13
it's-- %$* 13
the alternative is terrible. %$* 13
is that the only advantage? %$* 13
well, it's an important advantage. %$* 319
and campus systems vary quite a bit across the country. %$* 319
so some campuses will provide-- %$* 319
the main advantage for victims for the campus process is immediate process or fairly rapid, prompt process, and also a variety of remedies that are otherwise not available in court. %$* 319
so i emphasize that they can immediately change class schedules or move someone out of a dorm, essentially separating people who-- %$* 319
where there's an allegation of sexual assault, and they can do the kind of remedies that campuses can't engage-- %$* 319
or that courts can't engage in. %$* 319
okay, so those sound like real things. %$* 13
jeannie suk? %$* 13
yes, those are real things in terms of moving class schedules and dorm arrangements. %$* 318
actually, colleges are doing that even before the adjudication investigations are completed. %$* 318
that shows you that colleges feel empowered to just do that for the sake of student safety or just to preserve good relations in the dorm or for the-- %$* 318
just in the best interests of the students who are involved. %$* 318
they have all kinds of reasons to do things, like, say, you can't go to this dorm, you have to move, and i think that, that shows you it's not connected to whether the college is then going to have a-- %$* 318
an investigation, a trial, a tribunal, and go through that whole-- %$* 318
i have to say, jeannie-- %$* 320
i'm sorry to jump in here-- %$* 320
stephen schulhofer. %$* 13
but i have to say i'm very confused about this. %$* 320
if i'm living in a dorm and i don't like my roommate, i can't go to the college and say, "i want this person kicked out of the dorm." you have to have a reason for that, and colleges can't be requiring a student to drop a chemistry class or move out of his dorm or leave campus for a semester unless they decide that there is a reason. %$* 320
so if-- %$* 320
and that, that reason is credible. %$* 319
exactly, that it's credible-- %$* 320
so they had-- %$* 320
if you're saying campuses should not decide these cases but they should take action against the accused without making any decision and without having any process at all, that seems rather an odd idea to me. %$* 320
i think there are lots of different ways to make decisions. %$* 318
i think there are decisions made for all kinds of reasons. %$* 318
one-- %$* 318
the decision that we're talking about in this debate, decide sexual assault cases, is a determination of responsibility and guilt for what could be a crime. %$* 318
people do have disputes, like you're talking about, in their dorms. %$* 318
they do go to their resident advisor and say, "i'm having a problem," and sometimes they're brought in to have a mediation, to have a talk, to resolve, and they could-- %$* 318
colleges can advise and guide. %$* 318
and actually the department of education says, when it comes to the sexual misconduct matters, that's not even allowed. %$* 318
you have to go through some kind adjudicative process to decide the guilt of the party. %$* 318
let's let michelle anderson come in. %$* 13
sure. %$* 319
well, i guess i'm just wondering, why is sexual assault different than any other offense that's committed on campus? %$* 319
in other words, these kinds of offenses routinely go through adjudicative processes. %$* 319
and there's no reason to pull sexual assault as opposed to any number of other kinds of cases, and say, "well, that particular one has to go to the criminal courts, but the hazing case that led to the death of a student, or the plagiarism case, or an assault case, those can be adjudicated through a disciplinary process that is routine? %$* 319
jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
well, i don't think that's a fair characterization, michelle. %$* 317
look, it's really rare-- %$* 317
really rare to have colleges adjudicate a homicide. %$* 317
that almost never happens. %$* 317
it's really rare - - almost never happens for colleges to try and adjudicate an act of arson. %$* 317
rape is as serious a crime as homicide and arson. %$* 317
we do not typically-- %$* 317
we have never typically adjudicated major serious crimes like that. %$* 317
plagiarism, yes, of course. %$* 317
colleges are good at that. %$* 317
they know about that. %$* 317
hazing? %$* 317
hazing, fraternity stuff, that's a college problem. %$* 317
it makes sense for colleges to deal with hazing. %$* 317
but we are talking about treating rape very differently through this title ix process, not treating it the same. %$* 317
treating it the same would be an expectation that the police, and the courts, and the das, and the fbi come in an investigate this. %$* 317
and i do-- %$* 317
i need to say one more thing about our resolution. %$* 317
it's very important. %$* 317
for some reason, the other side is trying to characterize the resolution before you as barring colleges from doing anything about this, barring them from hearing these kind of claims. %$* 317
that's not true. %$* 317
that's not what the resolution does. %$* 317
the resolution says, "courts, not campuses, should decide." not barring them. %$* 317
the question is for you all to send a message that the body that should decide these cases are courts, not campuses, for all the reasons we have said. %$* 317
it's-- %$* 317
as john said at the beginning of this debate, the question before you, "is it preferable for courts to be deciding? %$* 317
" and in an ideal world, if colleges could do it just as well, fine. %$* 317
but unfortunately, it's been a disaster. %$* 317
and the right answer is that courts should be the ones deciding. %$* 317
michelle anderson to respond? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 319
i think that we read the resolution slightly differently. %$* 319
and i think that as a normative matter, the victim should decide whether or not she or he wishes to pursue a criminal claim with the police. %$* 319
and that is what should happen. %$* 319
and when the victim feels that she will be received or he will be received appropriately, and the justice can be served through the criminal justice system, that's the appropriate route for it to go. %$* 319
but there should also be an option for the victim to receive different kinds of redress through the campus justice system and through a process that provides different remedies and allows for immediate safety on campus. %$* 319
if i might add, there also-- %$* 320
i-- %$* 320
professor rubenfeld really lost me there completely, because if all the-- %$* 320
all that you're arguing in favor of is that courts should do it, but you're not opposed to campuses doing it, i don't understand your opening remarks with all the criticism of the lack of due process, and the conflicts of interest, and everything else. %$* 320
we acknowledge that that happens. %$* 320
and we think it should be fixed. %$* 320
but i think the thrust of your arguments is that campuses have no business deciding these cases. %$* 320
and we think that they-- %$* 320
not only they do have a business. %$* 320
they must deal with the situation where, for example, a student in our chemistry lab keeps getting groped by someone at the next lab table. %$* 320
they have to deal with that. %$* 320
and it's not desirable to send that case to a criminal court, where some immature adolescent is going to wind up on a sex offender registry-- %$* 320
well, stephen, if i might, you know, i was really-- %$* 317
no, the resolution is that courts should be doing it, because they're the ones that have the competence-- %$* 317
i think-- %$* 320
but if i could respond to the-- %$* 320
well-- %$* 13
groping point-- %$* 18
no. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
just on the groping point. %$* 18
not yet. %$* 13
not yet. %$* 13
i want to say this, moderator-wise. %$* 13
it's going to become a sterile debate if we sit here arguing about what exactly the motion says. %$* 13
i think i can get all of us to agree that, more or less, we're understanding the sense that, yes, they believe that sometimes people should have the right to go to the police. %$* 13
you are not saying, "no, campuses should have no involvement." i think we're talking about-- %$* 13
i think, as michelle put it, that students should have the option of a functioning sort of tribunal process system in the campus situation, that it should be there, active, and running if a victim doesn't want to go to the police. %$* 13
and your argument is, "well, you can try that. %$* 13
but the record shows that those systems are full of problems." so, i think that that's where we're debating. %$* 13
and we can move forward, forward on that rather than be parsing the motion. %$* 13
if i could add about the groping problem. %$* 317
sure. %$* 13
this is the problem of mixing together-- %$* 317
look, by sexual assault, this term, i understand to mean rape, okay? %$* 317
what i have said throughout all my arguments, and this is what jeannie was saying, too, is those are the cases the courts should be trying, not campuses. %$* 317
now, what's happening is that this term is getting expanded, as jeannie was saying to mean-- %$* 317
cover a whole lot of other things. %$* 317
and stephen's argument about this groping thing is, you wouldn't want that in a criminal court. %$* 317
police aren't going to prosecute. %$* 317
if courts-- %$* 317
if campuses want to have a code against offensive touching, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, sure, those are things that campuses could do well. %$* 317
and they should be able to do that. %$* 317
we are talking about sexual assault here. %$* 317
let's not expand that term so that it means all kinds of things-- %$* 317
other things and confuse the issue. %$* 317
well, that's a good point i want to take to your opponents because jeannie suk made the case that the definition of sexual assault is being trivialized almost to the point of meaningless by making it so broad. %$* 13
and part of their argument is that there's a mushing together in all of this process and that that's the culture of this conversation. %$* 13
and it's-- %$* 13
it's an interesting an intriguing point. %$* 13
i want to see if either of you would like to take it on. %$* 13
well, sure. %$* 320
i think, first, i don't want to quibble about terminology or cite a statute. %$* 320
but any criminal lawyer will tell you that if a young woman on the subway is groped in the butt or in the breasts, any unwanted touching like that is a sexual assault. %$* 320
there is no question about that. %$* 320
and it's a crime. %$* 13
that is a crime. %$* 320
she could go to the cops. %$* 13
she could go to the cops. %$* 320
so why not go to-- %$* 13
why do you think that the campus is better at adjudicate-- %$* 13
why do you think the campus should be set up with the option of adjudicating that rather than having that victim go to the police? %$* 13
that is a terrific question, john. %$* 320
it's a terrific question, and it's crucial to all of this, because on campus, you're talking about the victim's ability to pursue her education in a safe environment. %$* 320
and if the person who's-- %$* 320
on the subway, you can get off the subway and hopefully in a city of 8 million people, you won't see the person again. %$* 320
all right, but your opponent-- %$* 13
but when he's in your chemistry class-- %$* 320
right. %$* 13
but your opponents are saying that campuses are just not equipped to actually adjudicate what, in that setting, would be a crime. %$* 13
that they-- %$* 13
that the-- %$* 13
they don't have the professionalism to hear a case, they don't have the legal safeguards, they don't have the due process, they don't have transparency. %$* 13
they have conflicts of interest. %$* 13
that having a sort of campus type of tribunal for that crime is a mess. %$* 13
yes. %$* 320
i think you summarized their argument accurately, and i think it's a straw man, complete-- %$* 320
why? %$* 13
why? %$* 13
straw man. %$* 320
because conflicts of interest are intolerable. %$* 320
they should never be permitted. %$* 320
and the courts are striking them down. %$* 320
professor suk mentioned a whole series of cases which are striking these things down, as they should. %$* 320
they're fixing it. %$* 320
but we shouldn't, because of a few colleges, or many colleges mishandling these cases, we shouldn't say that no colleges should ever do it. %$* 320
so they're saying it's-- %$* 13
it's the exception or, at a minimum, the problems that are there, okay, they're real, but they're addressable. %$* 13
jeannie suk. %$* 13
it is not in any way the exception. %$* 318
the-- %$* 318
if you talk to people who are involved in this field-- %$* 318
and i myself have participated in and witnessed some of these things that i was talking about-- %$* 318
it is not in any way the exception. %$* 318
and it is-- %$* 318
and it's good. %$* 318
i agree with stephen that the courts have noticed and said, this is not okay. %$* 318
the conflicts of interest, though, that we're talking about are not just one-off conflicts of interest. %$* 318
we're talking about structural conflict of interest, where we're talking about a title ix officer who is charged with compliance with the department of education's dictates. %$* 318
and they are terrified about what's going to happen if they don't find a certain way, they don't do things a certain way. %$* 318
and how can that really lead to a neutral decision about the guilt or innocence of the party before them when they're thinking, oh, my god, am i going to have-- %$* 318
my school have funding taken away? %$* 318
or even if they're not ultimately going to have funding taken away, if, say-- %$* 318
can i-- %$* 320
can i just-- %$* 320
if their is an investigation against the school, then that's going to cost a hundred-- %$* 318
several hundred thousand dollars to even just deal with, even if at the end of the day. %$* 318
so when you're thinking like that, how can you be neutral about the guilt or innocence or about the facts of what happened? %$* 318
can i just ask whether jeannie and-- %$* 320
we haven't heard from michelle in a bit. %$* 13
michelle, please. %$* 13
michelle anderson. %$* 13
so the question of the incentive structure that-- %$* 319
that campuses face right now i think is an important one. %$* 319
historically, before the department of education strongly encouraged mandated that courts get-- %$* 319
that campuses get involved in these cases, the incentives for campuses were to sweep these cases under the rug. %$* 319
let's not-- %$* 319
we don't want the bad publicity. %$* 319
let's put it under the rug. %$* 319
today, however, the incentive structure is very different. %$* 319
the department of education mandates that campuses get involved and equitably and promptly adjudicate these cases. %$* 319
on the-- %$* 319
so that's powerful incentive to pursue these cases. %$* 319
however, on the other side, you've got all of these claims brought by accused students, indicate-- %$* 319
claiming that their due process rights were violated. %$* 319
that's powerful incentive the other way to provide due process. %$* 319
so you have two kinds of incentives on both sides. %$* 319
and that will lead to more equitable and fair outcomes. %$* 319
if there were no incentives to pursue these cases, campuses would not pursue them, and they would sweep them under the rug in the way that they have historically. %$* 319
if there were only pressure one way and no pushback by the accused students when their rights have been violated, you'd have a problem. %$* 319
but you have pressure on both sides. %$* 319
and campuses are responding, as they must, to these federal cases that are-- %$* 319
let's-- %$* 13
coming down. %$* 319
let's bring in jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
well, i think michelle's exactly right. %$* 317
we've seen an era when colleges, the big incentive was to sweep them under the rugs-- %$* 317
under the rug now. %$* 317
the incentive has changed. %$* 317
that is not the way, as jeannie is saying, to get conflicts of interest out of a process. %$* 317
that's the way to inject conflict of interest into a process. %$* 317
you don't want to give colleges an incentive to find a certain way, either way. %$* 317
and today, now they have this incentive to make examples, to show how seriously they're taking these things. %$* 317
and you can't say, well, now they've got pressures on both sides and it'll come out fine. %$* 317
no. %$* 317
two conflicts of interest don't equal impartiality. %$* 317
so what's the alternative, jed? %$* 319
so-- %$* 319
so the alternative-- %$* 319
so the alternative is the era before, where campuses swept these cases under the rug. %$* 319
what's the alternative? %$* 319
sending these cases, pulling these cases out alone and saying, if it were sexual assault, you want a difference between sexual assault and rape. %$* 319
if it were rape, that needs to go to the criminal court. %$* 319
but if it were sexual misconduct or groping or sexual assault, then campuses can adjudicate that. %$* 319
how does that make even sense? %$* 319
jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
the alternative is just to do with rape what we do with murder and arson. %$* 317
the alternative is you call the police, you expect them to do a professional, proper investigation, and you encourage students to report to the police. %$* 317
we heard earlier tonight that only about 5 percent of college women students who are victims are reporting. %$* 317
that's a huge problem. %$* 317
the alternative is to work better between colleges and the police to encourage reporting, to get these cases into the criminal justice system where rapists can get the punishment that they should get, and we can make our campuses and communities safer. %$* 317
john-- %$* 320
stephen, hang on one second. %$* 13
i will get-- %$* 13
come to you soon. %$* 13
i just want to say, after stephen's comment, i'd like to go to audience questions. %$* 13
and i'll remind you the way it will work. %$* 13
raise your hand. %$* 13
i'll call on you. %$* 13
you need to wait for the microphone to be brought to you. %$* 13
hold the mic about this far away from your mouth so that the podcast can hear you and the live stream. %$* 13
and tell us your name, ask your question. %$* 13
please make it a question. %$* 13
i would ask you not to debate with the debaters. %$* 13
make it a question, really terse. %$* 13
and if a question mark comes naturally at the end of whatever you say, that is a question. %$* 13
yes, thanks. %$* 320
i just was hoping to get some clarification about whether professor rubenfeld and professor suk are really in agreement, because as i heard professor rubenfeld, he was saying, well, what sexual assault means for purposes of this resolution is not what it means in the criminal law. %$* 320
what it means is rape. %$* 320
and rape should go to the criminal courts because that's a very serious crime. %$* 320
but if it's groping, some woman who can't do her lab work because the guy next to her is just some immature jerk, if that's all it is, then the campus can adjudicate that. %$* 320
as i understood professor suk, she was saying that the conflicts of interest are endemic and insoluble. %$* 320
and professor rubenfeld actually said that you can't solve one conflict-- %$* 320
offset one conflict with another. %$* 320
so to-- %$* 320
you know, i think got great responsiveness from the audience. %$* 320
but what are we saying about-- %$* 320
i mean, is it the case that campuses are just completely unable to fix the problems, and therefore they can't decide any of these cases, and that woman just has to tough it out? %$* 320
all right. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
stop right there, because i think it's a valid question. %$* 13
i want to hear the opponent's side. %$* 13
maybe jeannie suk will take this. %$* 13
the groping-- %$* 13
the groping case, which maybe isn't going to be prosecuted by the police. %$* 13
what happens to that student? %$* 13
and if there is an adjudication process, should she use it? %$* 13
so i have prosecuted that case here in manhattan. %$* 318
there were people being groped every day in times square. %$* 318
and it is incorrect, as was suggested earlier-- %$* 318
let's say a chemistry lab. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 318
it's a chemistry lab, not times square. %$* 13
yes, exactly. %$* 318
so that-- %$* 318
that's a crime just like it was in-- %$* 318
if it was in times square, it's a crime. %$* 318
and if it happens in a chemistry lab, it's also a crime. %$* 318
at that point, like any victim, this victim has the discretion whether to report to the police or not to the police. %$* 318
many of us have been victims of crimes. %$* 318
many of us have made a decision whether what-- %$* 318
whatever kind of crime it was, whether it was worth it to us to pursue the crime or not. %$* 318
i think that would be the situation for that victim. %$* 318
and she-- %$* 318
in my opinion, if i were her advisor, i would say, "go to the police because this is a crime, and a crime has been committed against you, the person will be arrested." %$* 318
well, i think your opponent's point is if she doesn't want to go to the police, should there be a tribunal set up at the-- %$* 13
on campus that she could go to? %$* 13
well, if we were living in a reasonable world with a reasonable department of education, what would actually happen, what could happen is the possibility that short of an-- %$* 318
a police-like investigation and a law-like court type of tribunal, you would have some reasonable parties get involved, talk to the people, and say, you know, "what's going on here? %$* 318
this is not acceptable. %$* 318
bad, bad, bad person. %$* 318
don't do that. %$* 318
don't do it anymore." and, you know, as stephen suggested, these are adolescents with raging hormones and exercising bad judgment. %$* 318
there are some cases like that. %$* 318
but what jed was talking about was serious cases of rape and sexual assault. %$* 318
now, "sexual assault" is an ambiguous term because it includes rape and in some jurisdictions it includes other things. %$* 318
in other jurisdictions, sexual assault is separate from rape. %$* 318
so there's a little bit of an ambiguity about what we're talking about. %$* 318
but what we are talking about essentially is serious crimes involving sex such as rape. %$* 318
i want to go to the audience, but i will give either of you 15 seconds to respond to that if you want to or we can move on. %$* 13
well, i think that we still need to know how to deal with this groping case, and we still need to know-- %$* 320
professor rubenfeld said, "let's encourage women to take all this to the criminal courts." i do not want to do that. %$* 320
i do not want to see this immature adolescent put on a sex offender registry for the rest of his life. %$* 320
okay, let's go to some questions. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
remember, again, the mic will come to you from down the right side. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name and then ask your question. %$* 13
hi, i'm alex. %$* 19
so about the groping question, i'm just curious-- %$* 19
so we've all watched "mad men" i'm sure, and we know that in the 1950s and '60s women didn't have a lot of outlets within the organizations within they worked for groping, things like that, sexual assault, that in reality most women are not going to go to the criminal system. %$* 19
most women have been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted in smaller ways like that. %$* 19
so i was just wondering, i think that from my perspective the workplace is a better comparison to school than the subway because the subway you can walk away, you're not going to see that person again, et cetera. %$* 19
so i was just wondering if there was anything that we could learn from what's happened from the "mad men" era to now with sexual harassment cases in the workplace that we could apply to this. %$* 19
i think there's a ton to learn. %$* 318
jeannie suk. %$* 13
so in-- %$* 318
if this happened in the workplace, the federal law called title vii would provide a way for that person to sue their employer for failing to prevent or to address a hostile work environment. %$* 318
now, title ix also is a law that one could use to sue one’s school for failing to address a hostile environment. %$* 318
now, there are many ways to address a hostile environment. %$* 318
do they all involve an investigation and an adjudication and a kind of tribunal like that? %$* 318
no. %$* 318
there are many ways to do the work that an educational institution, consistent with this pedagogical mission, to educate its students, to nurture them, to promote a kind of culture where sexual harassment is not considered acceptable. %$* 318
well, i must say-- %$* 320
and i appreciate the response, that resonates with the audience-- %$* 320
but i must say that in the workplace we don't just say, "well, the employer has to hold sensitivity training for his employees." if the-- %$* 320
if, in fact, there was groping, then the employee has to be-- %$* 320
the employee who did it has to be disciplined and know if an employer can't get away with his responsibility by just saying, "i'm going to ramp up my sensitivity training."and i think your question is excellent because it is exactly analogous, unlike the subway situation, the woman who's trying to pursue a career in the workplace cannot do that in a safe environment if she's subject to that kind of misbehavior. %$* 320
and there has to be a remedy. %$* 320
and there can't be a remedy without deciding what happened. %$* 320
we can't allow a woman or a man to say, "this person's sexually harassing me, so get rid of him." we can't just-- %$* 320
and this is where i part company with our opponents. %$* 320
i totally am unable to understand how they can say that schools can take action and impose remedies without deciding whether the allegations ever happened or not. %$* 320
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
another question. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
hi, my name is charlie, and i'm actually the vice chair of a board of trustees at a local college. %$* 18
so, i've got a million questions. %$* 18
but i'll just stick to one. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
the crux – maybe later. %$* 18
the crux of the issue seems to be the criminal law versus title ix. that seems to be the crux of the issue, which clearly have different definitions of sexual assault and methods of adjudication-- %$* 18
basically, very specific versus purposely vague, if you will. %$* 18
this is toward the team that's voting-- %$* 18
or arguing against the motion. %$* 18
how do you justify and reconcile setting up basically two separate and distinct methodologies of determining and adjudicating the process, and then holding the colleges responsible for both? %$* 18
i think it's crucial to remember that the objectives of these two different systems are different. %$* 320
first of all, the colleges are responsible, unless you want to say that-- %$* 320
repeal title ix. %$* 320
colleges are responsible for protecting racial minorities and women from sexual and racial harassment. %$* 320
and that includes not only things that are crimes. %$* 320
you could have a student who's receiving hateful email with the "n" word. %$* 320
and the colleges have to find out who did that and take some measures. %$* 320
it's not a crime. %$* 320
but they do have a responsibility to preserve an equal educational opportunity for all their women and minorities on campus. %$* 320
so, that's the objective. %$* 320
and the system is remedial. %$* 320
it's not punitive. %$* 320
the colleges' responsibility is to decide, by a preponderance of the evidence-- %$* 320
which is the standard that we use throughout the legal system for anything other than incarceration. %$* 320
decide whether the person did what's alleged and then take remedial action to protect the victim. %$* 320
usually involves some sort of separation. %$* 320
that is not criminal punishment. %$* 320
it's not incarceration. %$* 320
it's not a lifetime public record. %$* 320
it's not sex offender registration and so on. %$* 320
so, those things need to be taken to protect the woman's opportunity to get her-- %$* 320
to major in chemistry, to complete her class, and to get her degree. %$* 320
it's-- %$* 320
that's how we reconcile the fact. %$* 320
and it's the same reason why someone who sues for damages is heard in a different environment from somebody who's claiming to be the victim of a crime. %$* 320
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to go to another question. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
if you can-- %$* 13
sir-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
the person behind you i'm sorry. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i hate doing that, but i have an ambiguous point. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
thanks for doing such a good job. %$* 19
my name is rachel, and i was wondering, which adjudicatory process do you believe would have more-- %$* 19
have a more successful rate of deterrence against sexual assault? %$* 19
wow. %$* 13
what a great question. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 13
let's go to this side first. %$* 13
take it to jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
well, thanks for that great question. %$* 317
as you can guess, my answer is going to be the courts. %$* 317
because it is very hard to deter people from serious crimes if you slap them on the wrist for doing it. %$* 317
and being told to write a paper or even a suspension, that's a slap on the wrist. %$* 317
now, expulsion is a serious penalty. %$* 317
but if you keep that a secret, and it's non- transparent, that is not the way you deter sexual assault. %$* 317
i got to add one little point about a previous statement. %$* 317
the burden of proof that the government has forced us to use-- %$* 317
us colleges to use-- %$* 317
preponderance of the evidence-- %$* 317
look, at yale, what's our standard of proof for a plagiarism case? %$* 317
it's clear and convincing evidence. %$* 317
that, legally - - for those of you who know, that's a standard up from preponderance of the evidence. %$* 317
that's what we do with all our cases. %$* 317
now, with rape, we're forced to use a lower one. %$* 317
i got to say one more thing-- %$* 317
mediation. %$* 317
you have to understand-- %$* 317
this goes to the work- related question before. %$* 317
title ix has forced us to not do-- %$* 317
we're barred from doing mediation. %$* 317
what would grown-ups do with a groping allegation, grown-ups at a school? %$* 317
they bring the parties in, get them to agree. %$* 317
"you're not going to do this anymore. %$* 317
you agree. %$* 317
right? %$* 317
if you break this agreement, you will be subject to penalties." they agree. %$* 317
that's called mediation. %$* 317
no. %$* 317
we can't do that anymore because title ix-- %$* 317
jed, i think-- %$* 13
i'm going to stop you because i want to keep-- %$* 13
just give the other chance-- %$* 13
side a chance to focus on the question that was asked. %$* 13
and you had moved on a little bit. %$* 13
so, what about the question, michelle anderson? %$* 13
well-- %$* 319
which system would actually result in more justice, i think, essentially, is what you meant. %$* 13
actually, that's a different question than the one raised-- %$* 319
okay. %$* 13
so, if i moved it-- %$* 13
but that's an important-- %$* 319
then let's go-- %$* 13
one too. %$* 319
well, let's go with rachel's question. %$* 13
rachel asked, "which system leads to more deterrence? %$* 319
" and deterrence-- %$* 319
oh, deterrence. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
deterrence is one of the goals of the criminal justice system-- %$* 319
deterrence, incapacitation, retribution. %$* 319
we're all criminal law professors up here, so you could-- %$* 319
we could all talk about that. %$* 319
so the criminal justice system is designed to deter, generally. %$* 319
i think the goals of the campus adjudicatory system are very different. %$* 319
and i don't think they have the goal of large, general deterrents. %$* 319
i think they have the goal of individual assessment of the facts and trying to match a remedy that fits whatever happened. %$* 319
and i also think that the criminal justice system wildly overplays its hand in its-- %$* 319
and it's far too incarcerative and punitive in general, which is what stephen talked about in his remarks. %$* 319
i think your question about which leads to more justice-- %$* 319
can i save that for a few minutes from now? %$* 13
you can. %$* 319
thank you. %$* 13
down here, please. %$* 13
i'm going to come back to it. %$* 13
thank you so much. %$* 19
what a great debate. %$* 19
my name is dorchen leidholdt. %$* 19
and i direct the legal center at sanctuary for families. %$* 19
we're a large provider of services to victims of domestic violence. %$* 19
and increasingly, we're representing campus sexual assault victims in campus proceedings. %$* 19
so i'd like to just bring that experience to the table and ask a question. %$* 19
and i want to tell you what we're seeing in the campus cases we're handling. %$* 19
i-- %$* 13
i need you to just ask-- %$* 13
i'll sum it up super quickly. %$* 19
i-- %$* 13
first of all, we're-- %$* 19
i really-- %$* 13
i need you to get to the question. %$* 13
i'm getting to the question right now. %$* 19
i need right now. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 19
so the-- %$* 19
colon question. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13

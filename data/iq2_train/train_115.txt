intelligence squared exists because of the efforts of robert rosenkranz, who brought it to the united states and has made this thing grow and spread. %$* 13
and it's been a terrific effort. %$* 13
and tonight it's a feather in his cap and our cap. %$* 13
so ladies and gentlemen, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you, and welcome. %$* 1
we're so pleased to be here in chicago and proud to be a partner with the first chicago ideas week. %$* 1
my role in these proceedings is to frame the debate, to outline the reasons we felt it was worth having. %$* 1
tonight's motion is so counterintuitive one might wonder why we chose it as a topic. %$* 1
after all, there seems to be ample statistical support for the value of a college education. %$* 1
college graduates earn about $20,000 a year more than high school graduates, nearly half a million dollars over their lifetimes. %$* 1
some 9.7 percent of high school graduates are currently unemployed compared with 4.2 percent of college graduates. %$* 1
so going to high school and not college doubles your chance of being unemployed. %$* 1
in a rapidly changing global economy, many of the traditionally high-paid jobs in manufacturing that high school graduates could get are gone forever. %$* 1
and employers are looking for the kind of cognitive skills that we normally associate with college graduates. %$* 1
and turning from material considerations, a liberal arts education is likely to produce a superior electorate, a more vital civil society, a citizenry with better understanding of american ideals and better ability to adapt to changing circumstances. %$* 1
and on a more personal level, a chicago reporter asked me how i, transcending an obscure family background through scholarships to yale and harvard law school, could possibly entertain tonight's motion. %$* 1
so what is the counter argument? %$* 1
it is that only a small percentage of high school graduates actually have the aptitudes to do well with colleges of reasonable quality. %$* 1
the majority of those enrolling in college lack the basic skills and aptitudes to take pleasure in the experience or otherwise to succeed. %$* 1
for such students, college becomes an extended adolescence and at best a remediation for inadequate high schools. %$* 1
but not a grounding of the essentials of cultural intelligence and such basic skills as expository writing or quantitative reasoning or scientific method or primary research. %$* 1
might not such students get more from vocationally oriented education of the sort they would likely receive in such successful economies as germany and switzerland? %$* 1
in those countries, by the way, only about 20 percent or so complete four-year degree programs compared with double that figure in the u.s. and for the students at the very top of the scale, at the most elite colleges, might college prove an impediment to creative thinking or a distraction from their entrepreneurial drive? %$* 1
what lessons might we take from the extraordinary contributions of such college dropouts as bill gates, mark zuckerberg, larry ellison and steve jobs? %$* 1
well, your role tonight is to listen to the arguments, to question the panelists and ultimately to decide which side was more persuasive. %$* 1
whatever you decide, i hope you will come away with the sense that on this issue, like so many others that seem at first blush to be one-sided, that there is an intellectually respectable position on both sides of the debate. %$* 1
and with that hope, i turn the evening over to our moderator john donvan and this extraordinary panel of experts gathered for our first live debate in chicago. %$* 1
thank you, john. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
and may i just invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
true or false: too many kids go to college? %$* 13
that's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan from abc news. %$* 13
we are at venue six10 at the spertus center in chicago. %$* 13
too many kids go to college. %$* 13
two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, for it and against it. %$* 13
all of our debaters come to this from different perspectives, all of them are trying to win you over because you, our live audience, will act as the judges. %$* 13
and only one side will win. %$* 13
so let's meet our panelist of debaters. %$* 13
the motion being, "too many kids go to college." the team arguing for the motion include tech entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist, paypal cofounder, peter thiel. %$* 13
teammate is a political scientist who sees the bachelor of arts degree as a source of class division. %$* 13
american enterprise institute scholar, charles murray. %$* 13
opposing them at the facing table and arguing that it's not true that too many kids go to college, one of northwestern university's most transformative leaders, president emeritus, henry bienen. %$* 13
and joining him, an entrepreneur turned academic, he is also a columnist for the washington post, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
so this is a contest. %$* 13
it's a debate. %$* 13
one side will win, and one side will lose. %$* 13
and you, our live audience, will hear them debate for three rounds, and then you will choose the winner by voting once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
so let's go to the first debate now. %$* 13
if you go to the key pads on your seats, only pay attention because on the right hand side is the one that's relevant to you. %$* 13
pay attention only to keys number one, two and three. %$* 13
the others are irrelevant. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion that too many kids go to college, if, at this point, you agree with the side-- %$* 13
this side that's arguing that point of view, push number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree with this side, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you think you made a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
so remember, we have three rounds of debate. %$* 13
after the third round of debate, we ask you to vote again, to tell us who you think presented the best argument. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
these statements are uninterrupted. %$* 13
our motion is "too many kids go to college." and speaking first for the motion, i'd like to introduce peter thiel who is making his way to the lectern. %$* 13
peter thiel changed our world and the way we do business by cofounding paypal. %$* 13
he is the creator of that online payment system as well as an early investor in facebook. %$* 13
you have now, peter, stunned the world with your-- %$* 13
with your decision to offer grants of a $100,000 to people under 20 who forego college at least for a time to take on some sort of entrepreneurial task, which is going how? %$* 13
just got started, but we selected 24 students for the first two-year cohort. %$* 352
and they've been starting over the last month or two, and it's off to a really great start. %$* 352
all right, sir. %$* 13
a bit awkward fact, peter thiel himself, stanford 1989. %$* 13
1989. %$* 352
ba in philosophy. %$* 13
1992, law degree, stanford university. %$* 13
that is correct. %$* 352
i'm going to start with that fact, actually, but yes, that is very true. %$* 352
we're going to be looking for an explanation. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, peter thiel. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 352
let me actually just start with that question. %$* 352
you know, i went to stanford undergrad, stanford law school. %$* 352
throughout the '90s, i had a belief that education was absolutely paramount. %$* 352
we should only hire people that went to the best schools. %$* 352
and - - and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at paypal. %$* 352
and i use this - - and i used to-- %$* 352
i thought this was the most important thing in our society. %$* 352
and over the last four or five years, i've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of different reasons. %$* 352
the narrow technology context in silicon valley, that i saw so many very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done extraordinary well. %$* 352
in some ways, they were also more creative. %$* 352
they were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive but more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side. %$* 352
and this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when i went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously. %$* 352
the amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously. %$* 352
and so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago. %$* 352
college costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980.even after inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent. %$* 352
costs about four times as much. %$* 352
inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation. %$* 352
and as i looked outside of just the narrow silicon valley entrepreneurial context i've come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up-- %$* 352
in the '90s it was tech stocks, in the 2000s it was housing-- %$* 352
education, i'm not saying it's worse than it was 30 years ago but i don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it. %$* 352
and in '99 in silicon valley you couldn't question the nasdaq valuations, and in 2005 you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society. %$* 352
and to question the value of education is like questioning existence of santa claus with three- year-old kids or something like that. %$* 352
and while we're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country. %$* 352
we had two already. %$* 352
they were catastrophically bad. %$* 352
they led to enormous misallocation of resources. %$* 352
and when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs. %$* 352
student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000. %$* 352
and, you know, the law school context i'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the u.s., there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the u.s.and i would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many. %$* 352
the median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically. %$* 352
pre-med, only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school. %$* 352
the other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out. %$* 352
if you broaden the ambit more generally, there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's something like 6,100 people in the u.s. who have ph.d.s and are doing janitorial work. %$* 352
and so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society. %$* 352
we need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create more good paying jobs. %$* 352
we don't have enough of either in our society. %$* 352
and while education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing. %$* 352
and we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity. %$* 352
and in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound. %$* 352
and that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit. %$* 352
let me say one thing that we're not arguing for. %$* 352
we're not saying that nobody should go to college. %$* 352
we're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing. %$* 352
we're not saying everybody should drop out. %$* 352
we're simply saying that too many people are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we shouldn't-- %$* 352
we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice. %$* 352
and what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future. %$* 352
do not think of education as something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself. %$* 352
if i had to do something over again, having gone to stanford, i probably would still go to college even with the higher costs, if i didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead i'd probably still do the exact same thing as i did in the late '80s even with all the problems. %$* 352
but one thing i would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, i would have tried to think about what i want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything. %$* 352
the question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake? %$* 352
and if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to get a refund? %$* 352
peter thiel, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is "too many kids go to college.” and here to speak against the motion, henry bienen. %$* 13
he is president emeritus of northwestern university. %$* 13
and henry, in the nearly 15 years that you were there, the university’s success really was and is recognized as your success during those 15 years. %$* 13
the school increased its endowment 15 times. %$* 13
the sports team won more titles. %$* 13
applications skyrocketed. %$* 13
you launched a center for nanofabrication and molecular self-assembly. %$* 13
let harvard eat that, right. %$* 13
you know these guys at the other side are saying that you’re a denizen of the system that they say is in a bubble. %$* 13
so you’re going to need to impress them. %$* 13
it’s a joint effort to make a great university. %$* 353
thank you for that, john. %$* 353
it took a lot of people working hard. %$* 353
henry bienen. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 353
ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
well, thank you all for being here, especially mayor emanuel. %$* 353
thank you for coming. %$* 353
you gave a great speech this morning on the budget. %$* 353
this is an important debate. %$* 353
it’s about the american dream. %$* 353
it’s about social mobility and american democracy. %$* 353
because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create. %$* 353
i care deeply about this issue. %$* 353
i’m an educator, 28 years at princeton, 14.5 years as northwestern’s president, now chair of a proprietary for-profit college, rasmussen college, and a member of the board of education, appointed by the mayor for the chicago public school system. %$* 353
sure, some dropouts make it big. %$* 353
but social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis, not anecdotal individual life histories, no matter how compelling. %$* 353
most people are not bill gates or steve jobs. %$* 353
we should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in time as an indication of likely long outcomes. %$* 353
as damon runyon once said, “the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but that’s how the smart money bets.” the argument that too many people are going to college is not new. %$* 353
in his youth, richard freeman, a harvard economist, argued this in “the overeducated american” in 1976.he was wrong then, and our opponents are wrong now. %$* 353
and by the way, he’s changed his mind. %$* 353
we now have studies and lots of information. %$* 353
mr. %$* 353
rosenkranz alluded to some of them, which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more years of school, post-secondary, are positively correlated with earning over one’s lifetime, and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained. %$* 353
4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed. %$* 353
more than triple that number of high school students or high school dropouts are unemployed. %$* 353
this is very compelling. %$* 353
there’s a clear wage premium to education. %$* 353
there’s also a social premium to society, not just individual. %$* 353
society benefits through greater productivity, lower crime, better health, better citizenship for more educated people. %$* 353
and the wage premium to education has been growing since the 1980s, not shrinking. %$* 353
the question to be decided is whether it’s true that too many kids go to college. %$* 353
fact: in 2010, about 66 percent of the united states population between 25 and 30 had some college experience. %$* 353
the rest were high school grads or high school dropouts. %$* 353
it’s hardly the case that everyone or too many are pouring into college. %$* 353
we need more, not fewer, college graduates. %$* 353
going to college in the united states, by the way, means very different things. %$* 353
from two-year community colleges, flagship public research universities, small denominational colleges, elite privates, and for- profits. %$* 353
by the way, at the for-profits, the average age of the students is 28, and these are not kids. %$* 353
many of them are single mothers. %$* 353
many are minorities. %$* 353
they don’t choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great athletic teams or a climbing wall. %$* 353
they come to improve their careers, their income, their life chances, and they do. %$* 353
in his articles, mr. %$* 353
murray argues that too many people are going to college, and i feel he believes in innate qualities. %$* 353
he uses a language like, “he does not have it in him.” but how does he know this? %$* 353
what measures does he have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact? %$* 353
he believes, i think, that abilities are fixed. %$* 353
it’s a highly stratified view of the world and people’s places in it, and i don’t share it. %$* 353
true, plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready. %$* 353
we know this in chicago. %$* 353
but low college graduation rates and dropout cannot be attributed everywhere and completely to individual's intelligence or competence. %$* 353
even some qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out. %$* 353
no doubt, some people don't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed. %$* 353
but for many, their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not preparing them. %$* 353
we should not be so ready to consign them to what mr. %$* 353
murray may feel is their fate. %$* 353
neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what, for many will be low-level jobs. %$* 353
because for every college degree holder who is a janitor or a waitress, there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school dropouts. %$* 353
mr. %$* 353
thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college attendance and higher income. %$* 353
but he doubts the direction of causation. %$* 353
that is, college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it. %$* 353
in my view, whatever the direction of causation, you can learn skills at college and improve your life chances. %$* 353
and by the way, we have lots of studies, including studies of twins that allen kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself among all the other variables which count. %$* 353
and college does make a difference. %$* 353
now, high school vocational alternatives are there, but they're not widely regarded as-- %$* 353
they're widely regarded as second best by the general public. %$* 353
polls show that most americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college. %$* 353
they support alternatives for other people's children. %$* 353
i wonder if those in favor of the proposition want their own children or relatives to not go to college. %$* 353
mr. %$* 353
thiel, mr. %$* 353
murray, i know mr. %$* 353
thiel has started this fund, and i applaud his generosity. %$* 353
it is very generous. %$* 353
will he fund tens of thousands, millions? %$* 353
all the trend lines show a shift in the u.s.economy and its labor force towards more people requiring post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education. %$* 353
we've hollowed out industrial jobs. %$* 353
the clear way to premium for college graduates is growing. %$* 353
it skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. %$* 353
advanced degree holders did vastly better, and their advantage continues to hold up. %$* 353
and by the way, for women, that wage premium is even higher than for men. %$* 353
i need to conclude, but i want to conclude by saying there are not many alternatives in the u.s.we don't have a vocational system like switzerland or germany. %$* 353
i'm not against building such a vocational system. %$* 353
i'd like to see more tracks that people can go to. %$* 353
but what we really need to do is do better in pre-k through 12. %$* 353
we cannot accept that too many kids go to college. %$* 353
in summary, those who go beyond secondary school are-- %$* 353
not all kids. %$* 353
there are not too many of them. %$* 353
i'm not willing to consign them to low-level jobs. %$* 353
we need to do better, and we can't give up on the american dream. %$* 353
thank you. %$* 353
thank you, henry bienen. %$* 13
so a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have two teams of two members each arguing out over this motion: "too many kids go to college." you have heard the first two speakers, and now onto the third. %$* 13
charles murray is the w.h.brady scholar at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
and charles, you rather famously said that it was thanks to an sat exam in 1961 and your fabulous score that you were able to get out of a small town in iowa. %$* 13
that's what i thought at the time. %$* 354
and into harvard. %$* 13
well, i want to come back to that because-- %$* 13
so you went harvard. %$* 13
you did well in the liberal arts environment. %$* 13
then you kind of moved onto the conservative arts, and you-- %$* 13
a trend setter in terms of thought on issues such as welfare where your writings had impact on policy. %$* 13
your book, "the bell curve" despised by the left, and you like that. %$* 13
and i want to know where you are now on the sats that got you out of iowa. %$* 13
oh, i now recommend that we abolish the sat, because it turns out that if they give an achievement test, i probably would have gotten into harvard that way too. %$* 354
and the sat, as it now exists, has taken on a really bad number. %$* 354
ladies and gentlemen, charles murray. %$* 13
i think we better get the topic straight. %$* 354
when i agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, i thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the ba. i didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest. %$* 354
anyway, that's the way i'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, i wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative. %$* 354
almost everybody needs more education after high school. %$* 354
what they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, antediluvian thing called a ba.the thesis of my argument really is that the ba is the work of the devil. %$* 354
let's go through each of those accusations. %$* 354
first, fraudulent. %$* 354
the ba is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now-- %$* 354
an educated person. %$* 354
you know and i know that it doesn't represent that any more. %$* 354
the number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not-- %$* 354
don't exist. %$* 354
but it's much worse than that. %$* 354
if the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a ba, you don't know anything. %$* 354
if that seems too extreme, i can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a ba after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a d or an f. but guess what? %$* 354
they're transmuted into bs. %$* 354
and why are they transmuted into bs? %$* 354
because the story they want-- %$* 354
have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can. %$* 354
and you've got to retain kids. %$* 354
and in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college. %$* 354
you can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have bas, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well. %$* 354
all of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills. %$* 354
i am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems. %$* 354
and i'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges. %$* 354
knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much. %$* 354
yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering, okay. %$* 354
but what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me. %$* 354
it doesn't really mean anything. %$* 354
now, here is what you do know about a person with a ba if you know what school they came from. %$* 354
so if the applicant came from harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college. %$* 354
you know he had terrific sat scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in. %$* 354
you don't know anything about what harvard has added. %$* 354
and as a graduate of that institution, trust me, i am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways. %$* 354
none of this should be news to any of you. %$* 354
the retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education. %$* 354
except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless. %$* 354
okay, destructive. %$* 354
even though we know that the ba is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one. %$* 354
and the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a ba.the employers know how clueless many of them are. %$* 354
why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability. %$* 354
so they're being rational. %$* 354
but the problem is this: we have created a kind of self- fulfilling prophecy. %$* 354
we have created a culture in which not having a ba labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy. %$* 354
and so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper. %$* 354
it is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study. %$* 354
they aren't there to get an education. %$* 354
they're there to get a piece of paper. %$* 354
it is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential. %$* 354
it is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them. %$* 354
it is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish. %$* 354
but most of all it is destructive to america's civic culture. %$* 354
we have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity. %$* 354
we have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise. %$* 354
antediluvian. %$* 354
i have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete. %$* 354
four years is almost always too long. %$* 354
there's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work. %$* 354
a lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that. %$* 354
the rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing. %$* 354
what's the rationale for having a library these days? %$* 354
it used to be central. %$* 354
why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to millions? %$* 354
distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before. %$* 354
the information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education. %$* 354
well, that just begins to say what i want to say but what i'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined. %$* 354
what we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where they learned it and how long it took them. %$* 354
thank you. %$* 354
thank you, charles murray. %$* 13
our motion is too many kids go to college." and now to speak against the motion, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
he is director of research at duke's center for entrepreneurship. %$* 13
in fact, you have a long list of academic credentials. %$* 13
you have research and teaching positions at duke and at emory and at harvard law. %$* 13
and what am i missing? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and berkeley. %$* 211
and yet you started as an entrepreneur, you've cofounded and sold successfully two software companies. %$* 13
john, i call myself a tech guy lost in academia. %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
that's the shortest way of describing-- %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
you know-- %$* 211
it must be because i'm an immigrant, i'm a tech entrepreneur, i'm a foreign that i have a totally different perspective on this whole debate. %$* 211
in fact, when i first stepped into it, it was ripping peter thiel's head off in an article i wrote for telling kids to drop out of college because it didn't make sense to me. %$* 211
you know, as an academic for the last six or seven years i've been researching what's happening globally. %$* 211
i've been researching the impact of globalization on u.s. competitiveness. %$* 211
i've been researching american schools versus other schools, and so on, and what makes america what it is, you know our competitiveness, immigration, and so on, those topics i've been researching. %$* 211
and when i step back from that, my conclusion is that these people in america are totally completely out of touch. %$* 211
if you read my writings, you'll see that i've been writing very controversial articles, each of them rip into a different aspect of american competitiveness because we don't get it. %$* 211
we're sitting here in our own little bubble disconnected from the rest of the world. %$* 211
now, let-- %$* 211
i'm going to give you three perspectives on this. %$* 211
first of all, about u.s.education itself, believe it or not, u.s.education is by far the best in the world. %$* 211
everyone is trying to be like us. %$* 211
this is-- %$* 211
you know, i mean, people from abroad stake their life savings, you know, all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in sending their kids to america because we've got the best schools. %$* 211
what do gain from our schools? %$* 211
it's not the courses. %$* 211
it's really the knowledge. %$* 211
it's how to learn. %$* 211
you gain social skills. %$* 211
you learn how to interact with other people. %$* 211
you learn how to deal with failure, make compromises. %$* 211
you learn how to solve problems. %$* 211
these are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and american kids come out the best and the brightest in the world. %$* 211
this is why america is what it is. %$* 211
now, another argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college. %$* 211
you know, charles has written a lot about iq, iq tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life. %$* 211
to me that's complete baloney. %$* 211
i mean, my whole life i've faced stereotypes because i happen to be like a-- %$* 211
you know, one-- %$* 211
a race that may not be very smart. %$* 211
in my youth it just be that my people were beggars and snake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot ceos. %$* 211
in my lifetime i've seen the transformation of how people perceive me. %$* 211
so if i was going by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my people shouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to be successful, therefore, leave us out. %$* 211
you'll find the same thing with many other minorities in america. %$* 211
we don't know. %$* 211
i tell you if-- %$* 211
i know from my own children that they've gone through gyrations, so trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up. %$* 211
when they were young, they had some ideas. %$* 211
they don’t-- %$* 211
other ideas. %$* 211
now, if i had to decide when my sons were 16 years old, whether they would go to school or not based on their aptitude, it would be the worst decision i could possibly ever make because i’d be wrong. %$* 211
both of them decided to do completely different things than what they were talking about when they were young. %$* 211
children don’t know. %$* 211
so who are we? %$* 211
who are parents to try to figure out whether they should get education or not? %$* 211
america is what it is because of our education system. %$* 211
america started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. %$* 211
we became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone. %$* 211
now there are a lot of people left out as henry talked about, but the solution to fixing america’s competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone. %$* 211
now we can debate what a college is. %$* 211
to me, a community college is a college. %$* 211
a college-- %$* 211
you know, peter thiel basically has lived in this bubble called silicon valley where everyone thinks-- %$* 211
when they think college, they think stanford. %$* 211
they think berkeley maybe, so, you know, one level below stanford, but that’s it. %$* 211
and when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt, $250,000 of debt. %$* 211
i know some great people who have gone to community colleges who have almost no debt, who worked part time, been able to pay their fees off. %$* 211
our community colleges in this country are also colleges, and they too are better than the best-- %$* 211
they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the world. %$* 211
i don’t know why we keep forgetting that. %$* 211
now, i also taught, you know, i teach at several universities. %$* 211
i was at university, and my students brought up peter thiel. %$* 211
he’s quite a legend worldwide now. %$* 211
they were talking-- %$* 211
they said, “professor, is there really an american investor who’s paying children to drop out of college? %$* 211
” i mean, they were so, so confused. %$* 211
at the end of it, we talked about it, and they said, “you know, this is great because we’re going to eat their lunch.”this is what they were thinking. %$* 211
they didn’t say it. %$* 211
but this is what’s happening in the world right now. %$* 211
just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children, the rest of the world has learned our trick. %$* 211
india and china are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year. %$* 211
they’re educating all their people because they know that it’s going to make them like america, and they’re going to eat our lunch. %$* 211
so if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that, we’re going to lose out. %$* 211
you talk about entrepreneurship, again-- %$* 211
again, i have a lot of respect for peter thiel while chatting with him, but, you know, he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and do very successful. %$* 211
fine. %$* 211
they’re 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in america who don’t need to go to college. %$* 211
i have researched this systematically. %$* 211
what we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the same world that peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a bachelor’s degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees. %$* 211
in terms of success, that’s how much difference education makes. %$* 211
now, the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesn’t matter what school you graduate from. %$* 211
the tech founders in america, the most successful people in america graduated from a wide assortment of universities. %$* 211
there are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did. %$* 211
it didn’t matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from harvard. %$* 211
you could still make it big as an entrepreneur. %$* 211
why? %$* 211
because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn. %$* 211
now, moving forward, the indian and chinese are going to be eating our children’s lunch, guaranteed. %$* 211
i mean, i’ve researched it enough to know that we have a lot to worry about. %$* 211
if we disarm right now and stop teaching them, we’re going to become like they used to be. %$* 211
they are absolutely going to demolish this country. %$* 211
and what’s going to happen is that globalization is going to wreck havoc on industries. %$* 211
already we’re talking about manufacturing. %$* 211
we’re talking about several industries now going offshore. %$* 211
it’s going to happen more and more. %$* 211
we’re going to have to keep constantly reeducating our workforce. %$* 211
ten years from now, we’re going to have to have massive retraining programs for our workforce. %$* 211
if you don’t even have a bachelor’s degree, if you don’t even have basic education, you’re beyond hope. %$* 211
these people may be end up, you know, waiting tables at restaurants, but we’re going to have too many of those. %$* 211
we need to provide our workforce with a basic education. %$* 211
i say we’d have to have every american getting at least a bachelor’s degree and encouraging them to do master’s and ph.d.s. %$* 211
thank you, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
remember, we asked you to vote at the beginning of the debate, and we’ll ask you to vote once again at the end. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so now onto round two, and that’s where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you and questions from me. %$* 13
we have heard the arguments. %$* 13
we’re at venue 610 at the spertus center in chicago. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing this motion, "too many kids go to college.”the team arguing in support of that motion, peter thiel and charles murray, are arguing that college can be a drag, a waste of time for the very talented and for much of the rest of the students who are pursuing bas, they are pursuing what has been described as a worthless document, the bachelor of arts degree, meaningless document, the bachelor of arts degree. %$* 13
the team on the other side that include henry bienen and vivek wadhwa are arguing that, number one, going to college is part of the american dream, that those who go to college do better financially and otherwise than those who do not. %$* 13
and from a competitive point of view, we will be falling behind the rest of the world if we accept the notion that we need to limit, in some way, the numbers of people going to college. %$* 13
i want to put a question to the side that's arguing for the motion and take on that american dream question. %$* 13
and peter thiel, i think henry bienen used the term, we do grow up with the notion-- %$* 13
i think you've acknowledged it that in fact you felt straight-jacketed by it, that you do go to college because you're supposed to go to college. %$* 13
and yet the other side is arguing that that's part of the dream, part of the american dream. %$* 13
so take that on, because it's-- %$* 13
i think that they're onto something with that. %$* 13
well, it certainly was not historically part of the american dream. %$* 352
so if you looked at how many people went to college in the u.s.in the 19th or early 20th century, it was a very, very small percentage. %$* 352
and it was-- %$* 352
this is a very recent phenomenon that this is seen as an absolute necessity. %$* 352
and i think-- %$* 352
i think in many ways i would actually flip it around, and i would say, what's gone wrong with the american dream that we have to have people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past. %$* 352
people don't need college degrees for many of the jobs that we have. %$* 352
there are many good jobs where you don't need them, many bad jobs. %$* 352
people get stuck with college degrees. %$* 352
but i'd actually flip it around. %$* 352
this whole question of what sort of a good is college. %$* 352
is it an investment in your future? %$* 352
i don't think it's a good investment because it's costing too much, and there's no-- %$* 352
seemingly no accountability whatsoever from the other side on the costs. %$* 352
it was absolute good, any price. %$* 352
pay no attention what the price is. %$* 352
is it a consumption decision? %$* 352
and i sort of have joked that it's like a four-year party. %$* 352
and i think that's kind of true, but i think people are too stressed out to really have a four-year party when they're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they're going to be debt slaves for the rest of their lives or for the next 10, 20 years. %$* 352
and so i think the way to think of it is that it's basically become an insurance policy because the cracks in our society have become so big. %$* 352
and we need to be asking why are so many people having to pay more and more for insurance and what's gone wrong that we're paying so much for insurance. %$* 352
so henry bienen, you're opponent is describing more what sounds like an american nightmare in terms of the debt, in terms of having to do this, in terms of being the wrong thing for lots of people. %$* 13
and yet they go into it unthinkingly and get hurt by it. %$* 13
can you take that on? %$* 13
well, i didn't think this was a debate about cost. %$* 353
i'd be quite happy to talk about cost. %$* 353
a lot of the sticker price is discounted, as you know, through very substantial financial aid. %$* 353
plus i also took literally the topic of college which means lots of low-cost colleges vivek and others and myself pointed out. %$* 353
i don't think it's a nightmare for people. %$* 353
i think most people come out of a college experience feeling better. %$* 353
in fact, there's even surveys about how do you feel. %$* 353
you feel better as a person. %$* 353
and it's quite positive. %$* 353
i think of it as a consumption good but not as a full-time party for four years. %$* 353
no doubt there are some people who do that. %$* 353
woe to them. %$* 353
but it's a consumption good in that there's something good in and of itself of learning about beautiful things and learning more analytical ways of thinking. %$* 353
it was steve jobs himself, the late steve jobs, who said when he came back after dropping out of reed and sat in on courses, he took a calligraphy course. %$* 353
and that calligraphy course gave him a whole new world of thinking about design. %$* 353
who knows what, in the college experience will trigger for people thinking about the world in a different way. %$* 353
let me go to charles murray and-- %$* 13
maybe we want to discuss what the metric is, how do we describe whether college is worth it. %$* 13

i don't understand how legacy publishing is doing anything to hurt you, joe. %$* 378
the problem is you are in bed with the devil because-- %$* 378
and the devil is good, scott. %$* 375
the devil is good in bed. %$* 375
because you don't-- %$* 378
you have no-- %$* 378
no matter how popular you are, you have no control over amazon, and amazon has no interest in letting legacy publishers survive. %$* 378
scott, i don't have a contract with amazon. %$* 375
i can leave amazon whenever i want to. %$* 375
you have a contract with hachette. %$* 375
you once called amazon the "darth vader of the publishing industry." why are your books still on amazon? %$* 375
you're like profiting from selling the evil empire %$* 375
because they're a monopoly. %$* 377
you can't avoid them. %$* 377
oh, is that it? %$* 375
so, you can take a strong stance against something, but then profit off of it? %$* 375
what's that word? %$* 375
what's the word for that? %$* 375
i don't-- %$* 378
you can apply whatever word you want to, but where else am i supposed to go? %$* 378
where else are you going to go, joe? %$* 378
joe, you shook your head and denied something that i have seen you admit in print. %$* 378
for all your stout defense of amazon, they introduced kindle unlimited, and that cut your earnings. %$* 378
no. %$* 375
and it did it to many, many self-published authors. %$* 378
what-- %$* 375
i know what you're-- %$* 375
that's not what i said. %$* 375
you're misquoting me or you misread me or you misunderstood me. %$* 375
i don't make any decisions unless i have information. %$* 375
they introduced-- %$* 375
amazon introduced something called kindle unlimited. %$* 375
for $10 a month, you can get unlimited books, read as many as you want to. %$* 375
sounds terrible for readers. %$* 18
i know, that sounds terrible for-- %$* 375
it does sound terrible for readers, doesn't it? %$* 375
my books were in that program. %$* 375
i now have data of what it's like to be in that program. %$* 375
now i am going to take them out of that program because i control my books, and i am going to check to see how the data aligns. %$* 375
and if i don't like it, i will leave. %$* 375
matt yglesias. %$* 13
but was that a fair thing to do to you and the other self-published authors? %$* 378
as opposed to you who has no power over where your books are put? %$* 375
matt yglesias just let me bring back to you the question of whether you trust amazon to do the right thing, given its power. %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
are you good with them? %$* 13
i-- %$* 376
you know what, let me just quote my opponent, frank foer, on amazon. %$* 376
he said, "they want nothing else to breathe on this planet except their consumers," which is to say, "their readers." you know, i wear some different hats, i'm an editor at a website, i've written books, but as a reader i absolutely trust amazon, not because i have some crazy blind faith in them but because their business model is getting more people %$* 376
so, your opponents are talking about a world in which they will just be able to raise prices because they control everything, and it just won't be that %$* 13
well, as i've been trying to say-- %$* 376
that is a made-up world-- %$* 376
okay. %$* 13
in which you're wishing away apple and google. %$* 376
but let me just-- %$* 377
frank foer. %$* 13
read a quote from a respected author named matthew yglesias-- %$* 377
which comes from an article you wrote in slate where you described amazon as "awesome." you said, "if you own a competing firm, you should be terrified. %$* 377
competition is always scary, the competition against a juggernaut that seems to have permission from its shareholders to not turn any profit is really frightening."yes, matt yglesias, yes. %$* 377
amazon is definitely not a friend to competing bookstores. %$* 376
i mean, that article is all about the benefits-- %$* 376
the many benefits that amazon has brought to consumers through its relentless competitive spirit. %$* 376
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
and, again, i implore you that if you have an interest in this, let us know about it because we're probably going to be able to tell anyway. %$* 13
ma'am, right up there. %$* 13
and the mic is coming down to your-- %$* 13
behind you, and if you could stand up and again tell us your name. %$* 13
hold the mic about as far away from your mouth as this mic is from mine as well so we can hear you clearly. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
greetings. %$* 19
i will admit, i am a literary agent. %$* 19
so, i'm one of the first gatekeepers that our writers have to go through. %$* 19
and my question is what kind of readers are we talking about? %$* 19
because the books that come in to me are really unedited. %$* 19
i do what i can. %$* 19
then i find the right publisher. %$* 19
they edit them. %$* 19
so i think readers benefit from books that are edited by publishers. %$* 19
and we haven't talked about the editorial process and what the publishers bring to that. %$* 19
okay, i'm going to take that question to the side arguing for the motion because it sounds like more of a challenge to them. %$* 13
do you want to take that, %$* 13
editing is fantastic. %$* 376
i mean, i'm an editor in my day job at a website. %$* 376
you're a gatekeeper? %$* 13
i am. %$* 376
i keep the gates of what articles go up on the site. %$* 376
and i'm also a writer, and i feel like my writing has always been improved by editing. %$* 376
but you can see when you look, i mean, the world of writing is much bigger than the world of book publishing. %$* 376
and there's lots of different ways in which editing gets done between the final publication of something and the initial conception of it. %$* 376
and so i think when editors are adding value to writers and to readers, which i think they often are, there are ways to make that happen. %$* 376
i think the particular way that editing of books happens, the sequence from the writer, to the agent, to the publisher, to the editor who works for the publisher, you know, that is being several challenged by the current dynamic. %$* 376
but anyone who really cares about making their writing better, finds ways to work with editors. %$* 376
and that happens in newspapers, it happens in magazines, it happens in websites, and it'll continue to happen. %$* 376
so, matt is saying that it-- %$* 13
you don't need to have a-- %$* 13
you know, a big five editor editing your book in order to get edited. %$* 13
i-- %$* 378
well, i don't know where else it's going to come from unless-- %$* 378
the model that joe believes in is one where the self-published author goes out and hires his own marketing advice if he's not a marketer himself, his own editor if he's not his own editor-- %$* 378
which is not a good idea i think ever, it's like being your own lawyer-- %$* 378
so and i don't know where these authors who are just starting out are going to get that editorial advice, where they're going to get the bankroll to finance the marketing and the editorial. %$* 378
joe, you live it. %$* 13
i mean, who edits for you? %$* 13
i love editors, and i have several editors, and they're easy to find. %$* 375
there's a whole group in this country called, "freelancers," and they actually will do editing for a set fee, and that set fee is nice. %$* 375
it's some cost. %$* 375
it's not you paying forever. %$* 375
when you are edited by one of the big five, they own that book for your lifetime plus 70 years. %$* 375
that editor who spent two weeks on a book that it took you two years to write gets paid for that long. %$* 375
i'd rather pay a freelancer some costs and then keep the money from that point on. %$* 375
frank foer, what's wrong with that argument? %$* 13
so, freelance editors are-- %$* 377
their life with the project is-- %$* 377
you said two weeks or something-- %$* 377
they're not fully invested in the success of a project. %$* 377
when a publisher edits a book, they're invested in its success. %$* 377
they have very, very strong incentives for excellence. %$* 377
a freelancer, some person you find on the internet, to come punch up your book, isn't going to be fully invested in its excellence. %$* 377
that's-- %$* 13
all right, that-- %$* 13
i get that point. %$* 13
i want to take it back to your side. %$* 13
it's very-- %$* 13
matt yglesias, very persuasive point. %$* 13
you know, listen. %$* 376
future business models, that's tough, i-- %$* 376
you know, i could be like a book visionary, but i'm not. %$* 376
i'm just an editor on a website. %$* 376
but the fact of the matter is you can imagine lots of different ways this works, right? %$* 376
you can imagine companies that just don't happen to be the existing big five publishing companies doing a similar sort of service, where they look at drafts and when they find drafts that they think are promising, they agree to edit them, work on them, and improve them in exchange for a percentage of the sales. %$* 376
that's not like a crazy business to be in. %$* 376
the book publishing business has worked along that kind of model for a long time. %$* 376
it often is the case when technologies change that the particular incumbent companies lose out, but something sort of similar takes its place. %$* 376
i think that you've seen in the journalism world that i'm in, right, that some old companies have struggled. %$* 376
some old companies have thrived. %$* 376
some new companies have come out, but this stuff that's really valuable in terms of like writing, reporting, editing, that still happens at all different kinds of places and i think you'll see the same thing in publishing. %$* 376
the quality of editing on the internet, though, has diminished significantly. %$* 377
i mean,-- %$* 377
and it's-- %$* 377
you know, editing is not just a business it's a craft. %$* 377
it's something that you have to practice with devotion just like writing is, and, in order to get that quality of editors that you'd want in order to really significantly improve things, you need people who are committed to craft. %$* 377
and the worst thing is if writers are going to perceive editing as just kind of an unnecessary expense, because no writer really truly believes that they need to be edited. %$* 377
and writers are the people in the world who are least able to see the flaws in their own work. %$* 377
so, joe konrath, it sounds as though matt yglesias is, i don't want to say conceding, but is acknowledging that there are some services that legacy publishers do deliver, such as editing, that have a value. %$* 13
but that the framework in which they exist is the killer for you. %$* 13
well, everything is of value, but value also has a cost and the cost for a legacy editor is, in my opinion, too high. %$* 375
in some instances it may not be too high. %$* 375
i had a great publisher at hyperion for my first six books. %$* 375
her name was leslie wells. %$* 375
she was great. %$* 375
and now she was fired so i can hire leslie wells whenever i want to and she just appeared on my blog talking about her new book, which she self-published. %$* 375
and is she editing it herself? %$* 13
no, she's going to get an editor. %$* 375
okay. %$* 13
another question, please. %$* 13
right in the center here. %$* 13
you're wearing an orange shirt. %$* 13
again, if you've got skin in the game let us know. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 18
can you hear me? %$* 18
yes, very clearly. %$* 13
jim corsey, avid reader and member of the unwashed masses. %$* 18
this is for the against group. %$* 18
information by itself wants to be free and throughout-- %$* 18
that is-- %$* 18
i'm sorry. %$* 18
there is nothing else in this society that is supposed to be free. %$* 18
to say information is free-- %$* 18
to say information wants to be free-- %$* 18
scott, i'm going to ask you to let the guy get the question out. %$* 13
okay. %$* 378
john, i disagree with the premise. %$* 378
you can come back to that, but i really want to see what happens when he gets to the question mark. %$* 13
throughout history disruptive technologies have brought information to us in a variety of different ways from the creation of written language to the gutenberg bible to the creation of competitive press to electronic publishing and e-books. %$* 18
and my question to you is why are you so afraid of the latest revolution in allowing us to have access to information in the way that we want? %$* 18
why do you say they're afraid? %$* 13
why do you portray their argument as one based on fear? %$* 13
because they're providing us with a view that there has to be a set of, i don't want to use the term oligarchy, but there have to be curators for the information that we're allowed to access and consume so we know which one is the good and which one is the not good. %$* 18
it's about the judgment process that you're questioning. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
let's take it to scott. %$* 13
you have-- %$* 13
first of all, my differing with the people who say information wants to be free are the people who want to devalue copyright and indeed even do away with it and i think if you do that you will not have authors, you will not have books, and you are doing no service to readers. %$* 378
i'm not sure, though, that you're listening carefully to what frank and i have been saying. %$* 378
i am not against joe self-publishing his books. %$* 378
i am happy that that is happening. %$* 378
i believe the more voices the better. %$* 378
so i'm not against that. %$* 378
the problem is that the company that joe works with wants to do away with the other model and that is i believe overall an immense threat to our culture. %$* 378
let's take another question. %$* 13
has the number of books read by the number of people-- %$* 19
has book readership in general increased since amazon has become so powerful? %$* 19
in other words, not just their slice of the pie, but have they grown the pie? %$* 19
have they contributed to that? %$* 19
and if so, what does that indicate about their friendliness? %$* 19
nicely done. %$* 13
joe konrath. %$* 13
i've got a friend named hugh howey whose sales just completely blow mine away and hugh and an unnamed data guy who i happen to know who really knows his stuff, started a website called authorearnings.com. %$* 375
and what they're showing is, yeah, the pie is growing. %$* 375
traditional publishers don't see the pie growing. %$* 375
their part of the pie is staying the same. %$* 375
but for the rest of us, the pie is getting bigger. %$* 375
would you like to respond, on this side? %$* 13
well, here's the one problem with that. %$* 378
amazon doesn't release sales figures. %$* 378
so, we have no idea whether hugh howey, who of course is the champion for his own cause, is accurate. %$* 378
his data guy is totally unnamed. %$* 378
there's no backing up of his sources. %$* 378
the data is there, scott. %$* 375
you can check it. %$* 375
anybody can check it. %$* 375
he-- %$* 375
they list everything and their math is solid. %$* 375
scott %$* 13
joe, it could be a work of fiction. %$* 378
nobody knows where those numbers came from. %$* 378
they take screenshots of amazon. %$* 375
that's where they're coming from. %$* 375
we're in the middle of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, second round-- %$* 13
i have to do this little bit. %$* 13
hang on one second. %$* 13
our motion is this, amazon is the reader's friend. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
and we have two teams of two debating for and against-- %$* 13
joe konrath and matt yglesias arguing for, frank foer and scott turow arguing against. %$* 13
we're taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
right down in the front here. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
i'm sadie. %$* 19
hi sadie. %$* 13
my question is directed mostly towards the opposition, particularly towards scott, because he's a published novelist. %$* 19
full disclosure, i work-- %$* 19
i volunteer at a writing outreach nonprofit based in my hometown, called project write now. %$* 19
i'm wondering what you think about-- %$* 19
do you think that if amazon really does become this-- %$* 19
this monopoly that you fear it will be, or fear it already is, do you think the quality of books that are getting out there and getting popular are going to decrease? %$* 19
the short answer is yes. %$* 378
and it's-- %$* 378
but it's for complicated reasons. %$* 378
what i worry about is that most authors can't afford to be self-published authors. %$* 378
they can't spend years and years working on their books. %$* 378
they can't-- %$* 378
a first-time author has no money to hire an editor or a marketing guru. %$* 378
and so, the temptation-- %$* 378
and what happens with most of the self-published authors is that they produce book after book-- %$* 378
sometimes several in one year. %$* 378
now, i will tell you. %$* 378
trollope and dickens wrote at that pace. %$* 378
steve king writes a lot of books. %$* 378
so, it's not-- %$* 378
i'm not saying it's all bad. %$* 378
but i'm telling you that the odds are that most people aren't trollope and dickens. %$* 378
and so, yes, that system, i think, will produce works of lower quality, and less thoughtful works. %$* 378
i think that scott is skipping a lot of logical steps when he gets-- %$* 376
so, what he is actually describing is not a world in which amazon has ruined literary culture. %$* 376
he's describing the fear-- %$* 376
a fear that i think a lot of people share, and not totally unreasonably, that readers-- %$* 376
maybe the world just doesn't want to pay for great literature. %$* 376
and i think that's an interesting question, right? %$* 376
i mean, maybe, netflix will destroy literary culture. %$* 376
and-- %$* 376
but that's not what we're debating here, right? %$* 376
i think any world where there are people, talented authors with great books that they want to write, and if there are readers who want to get their hands on great books, there is just no way that amazon, as a retail layer in the middle, is somehow preventing that from happening. %$* 376
there are plenty of ways that you could put books up for sale that don't involve amazon. %$* 376
there's no sign that amazon has some objection to great books being sold on its platform. %$* 376
amazon is trying to sell as much stuff to as many people as they possibly can. %$* 376
and these other sort of questions-- %$* 376
big questions about the future of books-- %$* 376
are very important. %$* 376
but we have to understand that, like, amazon's commitment to serving readers and to serving the book market in a digital world is part of what helps books stay viable in a world where they face competition from all kinds of other entertainment. %$* 376
let me see if anybody wants to respond-- %$* 13
frank foer. %$* 13
you know what? %$* 377
amazon-- %$* 377
amazon isn't just a search engine. %$* 377
it's not just a place you can go in and look for whatever book that you're interested in. %$* 377
amazon has a home page, a very powerful home page that drives traffic to books. %$* 377
they decide-- %$* 377
they pick winners and they pick losers. %$* 377
and they have tremendous power-- %$* 377
but doesn't-- %$* 13
don't the publishing houses do exactly the same thing? %$* 13
they do. %$* 377
but the problem is that we're imagining a world where you have one-- %$* 377
i mean, this is the nightmare scenario where-- %$* 377
which we're on the road towards, where you have one company that is the arbiter of all things literary, all things book. %$* 377
and they-- %$* 377
okay. %$* 13
they set the standards, and they make the choices. %$* 377
and it's not a neutral playing field, where we all have a-- %$* 377
let me-- %$* 13
chance. %$* 377
take that point to this side. %$* 13
because matt yglesias is arguing it's not going to happen, because there's google and apple. %$* 13
but as a theoretical thing, if you guys don't mind playing with the hypothetical, joe konrath, if-- %$* 13
if amazon ultimately became fully a monopoly, had no competition, would that be a nightmare scenario, that amazon was alone and able to pick the winners and losers? %$* 13
they're not picking anything. %$* 375
they're just allowing anybody who has an idea to have the opportunity-- %$* 375
no. %$* 13
i'm talking about-- %$* 13
i'm talking about-- %$* 13
to reach-- %$* 375
i'm talking about the ranking he was just talking about, on the home page. %$* 13
they pick which ones to put on the home page and which not to. %$* 13
well, it's their company. %$* 375
they can do what they want to with that company. %$* 375
is that-- %$* 13
i know they can. %$* 13
is it %$* 13
i would love to have my books available on scott's site. %$* 375
it's not going to - - %$* 375
i know they can. %$* 13
their point isn't that they can-- %$* 13
it's their choice. %$* 375
or-- %$* 13
their point isn't they can or can't. %$* 13
their point is that it would be a bad thing. %$* 13
i just want to see if you think that would be a bad thing or not. %$* 13
well, hypothetically, i think a lot of bad things can happen. %$* 375
but i don't see that happening right now. %$* 375
i talk with amazon about changing algorithms. %$* 375
i haven't heard anybody admit that, "yeah, we're futzing with this and we're futzing with that." now, they're notoriously tight-lipped about anything. %$* 375
what are they going to tell me for? %$* 375
but how do we automatically jump to, "wait a second. %$* 375
amazon is doing something shifty here." %$* 375
but it is shifty. %$* 377
and let me-- %$* 377
frank foer. %$* 13
tell you why. %$* 377
right now, when you type in-- %$* 377
you type in "police"-- %$* 377
"police noir novels" into their search engine, you get a series of results. %$* 377
how do you think that series of results is ranked? %$* 377
a publisher has paid for one of the top ranks there. %$* 377
so, that's-- %$* 377
that's their but they're not-- %$* 377
they're not letting consumers into that in a-- %$* 377
that, you know, with full awareness of the ranking that's actually happening there. %$* 377
they're posturing as if it's like google. %$* 377
you think amazon invented that? %$* 375
that's called co-op. %$* 375
that's why, when you go into a barnes & noble, you see 400 scott turow books-- %$* 375
but it's-- %$* 377
stacked up in front-- %$* 375
no. %$* 377
no. %$* 377
and you see my one book out in section. %$* 375
but it's different if you have one big player picking the winners and losers. %$* 377
and that's-- %$* 377
that's the point you guys haven't really addressed here tonight, which is that we're-- %$* 377
they already have 57 percent of the-- %$* 377
yeah. %$* 13
e-book market. %$* 377
i mean, just as-- %$* 13
just as the referee of the debate, i agree that you haven't addressed it. %$* 13
now, you-- %$* 13
you've refuted it as, "why should i deal with it, because it's not going to happen," matt. %$* 13
and joe, you're refuting it as, "i can't talk about hypotheticals." fair enough if that's your response to their hypothetical, but you just don't think it's worth dealing with. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
i want to give you-- %$* 13
one more – %$* 13
no. %$* 376
no. %$* 376
no. %$* 376
let me try to respond to it as clearly as possible. %$* 376
okay. %$* 13
if their argument is that in a counterfactual world, in which no other websites existed, that then, in that world, amazon would be a threat to literature and to readers, that's true. %$* 376
but it also tells you that in the actual world, where there are lots of other websites, it isn't the kind of threat they pose-- %$* 376
but to generate this threat, they have to assume a crazy series of subsequent events that take us from here to this dystopia. %$* 376
you think-- %$* 13
you think we're far, far away from that happening, is what you're saying? %$* 13
yes. %$* 376
there’s no possible way it could happen. %$* 376
can i ask just a brief question, joe? %$* 378
what percentage of your sales take place on the amazon platform? %$* 378
when are we talking these sales? %$* 375
in the past? %$* 375
maybe 70 percent. %$* 375
recently, 95 percent. %$* 375
now i'm scaling back on amazon, because i'm going to test some things out with some other platforms, see what they're doing. %$* 375
it changes. %$* 375
it fluctuates. %$* 375
the industry is in flux right now. %$* 375
well, 95 percent, matt, doesn't sound like the other websites are doing very well to me. %$* 378
i'm not on the other websites. %$* 375
let's now go to a question, please. %$* 13
i'm jeremy greenfield. %$* 18
i've written about this topic for a long time. %$* 18
and i actually conceived of, and authored, and edited the original versions of the studies that frank mentioned. %$* 18
my question is also about different kind of reader, the reader who lives in a rural area, who doesn't have access to a large literary culture, the reader who finished the latest scott turow book on the beach and wants to read one of the older ones immediately. %$* 18
is amazon not that reader's friend right now? %$* 18
that's a great question. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 13
let's take that up. %$* 13
scott, you take it. %$* 13
just to go back to where i started-- %$* 378
i will not say that amazon does nothing good or that amazon hasn't contributed value to the reading world. %$* 378
of course they have. %$* 378
the vast library-- %$* 378
they've cut down the barriers to book buying. %$* 378
they've made things instantly available. %$* 378
it's an enormous library of available material, and they're great for the person in the rural area. %$* 378
and i believe all of that. %$* 378
the problem is it's a binary world. %$* 378
they will not agree to anything but their model. %$* 378
they want to crush the publishers. %$* 378
they see no benefit in their existence. %$* 378
and i know that when that happens, the literary culture will be poorer, and, as a result, they call it "creative destruction," i call it "cultural destruction." %$* 378
in the far corner there. %$* 13
hi, so for the kind of-- %$* 19
could you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
oh, hi, i'm carrie so, for books that are currently out of print, you know, that are still available from amazon just, you know, from other sellers who actually want to sell that book, isn't amazon the reader's friend for that reason? %$* 19
more reader's friends reasons, there are a lot of them coming up. %$* 13
frank foer, why don't you take that? %$* 13
my sense is that the out-of-print book market is something that the internet more broadly does a good job of. %$* 377
so, yes, they are the reader's friend in that sense, and so is ebay, and so are any number of sites. %$* 377
that happens to be one part of the market where there's more competition because the barriers to entry are lower. %$* 377

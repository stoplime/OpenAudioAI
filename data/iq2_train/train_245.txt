hi, john. %$* 1
hi, bob. %$* 13
and what robert does-- %$* 13
what bob does is he frames for us, just in a couple of minutes, what the stakes are in this debate and what's-- %$* 13
what are-- %$* 13
the validity of the arguments on both sides. %$* 13
so let's start, bob, just by asking why this debate now? %$* 13
well, it's very timely because, of course, colorado and washington have just passed referenda legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. %$* 1
now, this topic is broader than marijuana. %$* 1
this is about all kinds of recreational drugs. %$* 1
but it's timely for that reason, and it's also timely because in recent years, both the left and the right have coalesced around the pro motion position. %$* 1
and the side arguing for the motion to legal lies drugs, how strong an argument do they have? %$* 13
well, i think their best argument is that current policy has failed. %$* 1
and we'd be better off placing reliance on treatment, on rehabilitation, on education. %$* 1
that the costs of creating a criminal industry are huge, not only the obvious costs of enforcement, of prison, but we create a situation in which the leading role models in inner city communities are drug dealers in which a disproportionate number of black youth languish away in prisons. %$* 1
and the team arguing against the motion, what's their best argument? %$* 13
well, i think their best argument is simply that the consequences of drug use are so severe that the government can't simply leave this is a matter of individual choice. %$* 1
in many cases, kids get hooked on drugs well before they reach the age of being able to make reasoned choices. %$* 1
and it's just simply not a matter where you can have a libertarian idea that this is-- %$* 1
that this is individual, because it affects so much else in society. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
so there we see it framed, the debate in front of us. %$* 13
and let's bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i just want to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
we call it a war, and for 41 years, we have been fighting it, a war on drugs. %$* 13
the estimated costs so far, about 2.5 trillion dollars. %$* 13
the results so far, mixed. %$* 13
so what does it say that voters in colorado and washington state recently went to the ballot box and decided to legalize one of the drugs we've been fighting all of these years, weed, pot, marijuana. %$* 13
what is that, is it treason, or is it a facing up to a certain social reality? %$* 13
is this war worth continuing to fight on? %$* 13
and if so, what direction do we take it in? %$* 13
those are a lot of questions. %$* 13
but they all boil down to the one that we're going to be debating here tonight. %$* 13
and here it is: yes or no to this statement, legalize drugs. %$* 13
that is the motion on the table. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for and against it, legalize drugs. %$* 13
we go in three rounds. %$* 13
then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
meeting our debaters, on the side arguing for the motion, legalize drugs, paul butler, professor of law at georgetown and former federal prosecutor. %$* 13
his partner, nick gillespie, editor in chief of reason.com and reason tv. %$* 13
the motion, "legalize drugs," arguing against, asa hutchinson, ceo of the hutchinson group and former administrator of the drug enforcement administration. %$* 13
and his partner, theodore dalrymple, a retired prison doctor, now a fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize drugs." let's talk with our debaters as they come to the stage. %$* 13
paul butler, you are a georgetown law professor. %$* 13
you are arguing for the motion, "legalize drugs." after harvard law you clerked for a judge. %$* 13
you worked in corporate law. %$* 13
you then became a federal prosecutor and worked for the department of justice. %$* 13
but then something happened that made you give it all up, and it changed the way you thought about the criminal justice system. %$* 13
what was that? %$* 13
so somebody forgot to tell the police about all those credentials. %$* 645
and i got arrested for a crime i didn't commit. %$* 645
it was when i had the most high profile case as a prosecutor, i was prosecuting a u.s.senator, and, again, i got locked up. %$* 645
you can read all about it in the first chapter of my book, "let's get free, a hip-hop theory of justice." %$* 645
commercials allowed. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is nick gillespie. %$* 645
ladies and gentlemen, nick gillespie. %$* 13
nick, you are editor-in-chief of the libertarian reason.com and reason tv? %$* 13
i'm guilty. %$* 646
you have talked about the fact that you have used both legal and illegal drugs recreationally. %$* 13
interestingly, you once lived on a street called "stoner avenue." you did not use illegal drugs while living there, which ruins the story a little bit. %$* 13
but what is your take seriously on recreational drug use? %$* 13
is there a danger involved in them? %$* 13
i'd say the only danger is that oftentimes you run out. %$* 646
our motion, "legalize drugs," and the team arguing against the motion, first, ladies and gentlemen, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
theodore dalrymple is your pen name. %$* 13
we'll say this just once. %$* 13
your real name is anthony daniels, for people who like the specificity. %$* 13
you are a writer, a former prison doctor. %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
in prison you specialized in cases involving drug offenders, and you came away from that experience thinking that we have the relationship between crime and drugs wrong. %$* 13
in what way, theodore? %$* 13
well, i'm going to say that we've got the relationship exactly the wrong way around. %$* 647
but it's always tempting for people to ascribe human misbehavior to an external factor when actually it's internal. %$* 647
so i don't believe in the causative relationship between drugs and crime and bad behavior, actually. %$* 647
and your partner is? %$* 13
asa hutchinson. %$* 647
ladies and gentlemen, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
asa hutchinson, you are a former administrator of the drug enforcement administration. %$* 13
you were also a long term member of congress. %$* 13
you had served two terms. %$* 13
you had just been elected for the third time when president bush tapped you to go to the dea. why'd you make the choice to do that? %$* 13
how do you say no to the president when he asks you to do something? %$* 448
you try to say yes. %$* 448
jokingly, but seriously, what a great agency. %$* 448
and i wanted to bring not just enforcement efforts to dea but also demand reduction efforts and cooperation with the rehabilitation community. %$* 448
all right, ladies and gentlemen, our four debaters. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize drugs," and before the debate begins and again after the debate we're going to ask you to vote. %$* 13
that's two votes. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers, changed most of your minds in the course of the debate, between those two votes, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the first round of voting now. %$* 13
our motion is legalize drugs. %$* 13
if coming in off the street you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and you can correct a mis-keying. %$* 13
it'll lock in your last vote. %$* 13
anyone need more time or want to admit needing more time? %$* 13
it's pretty straightforward. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so once again, we're going to hold the results of that vote till the end of the debate, until you've heard all of the arguments, all three rounds, and then the team that has moved its numbers the most after the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round one, opening statements from each debater in turn, they will be seven minutes, each. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize drugs," and here to speak first for the motion, paul butler. %$* 13
he is a professor of law at georgetown, a former federal prosecutor, and one of the nation's most frequently consulted scholars on race and criminal justice. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul butler. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 645
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 645
my name is paul butler, and i represent the people. %$* 645
when i was a prosecutor, that's how i would start my opening statements. %$* 645
i put a lot of people in prison; i was a soldier in the war on drugs, and tonight i'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure. %$* 645
later, nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and made us all less free. %$* 645
and he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look like. %$* 645
will you be able to go into whole foods and buy cocaine? %$* 645
nick will tell you about the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs. %$* 645
as a prosecutor, i learned that as many people as i locked up, we weren't making a dent in the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe. %$* 645
i was prosecuting a lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses. %$* 645
locking up these young people with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing school for criminals. %$* 645
when these kids came home, they had learned how to be really good bad guys. %$* 645
if we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer. %$* 645
maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that. %$* 645
no country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs. %$* 645
the united states locks up more people than any country in the history of the world. %$* 645
we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. %$* 645
it costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs now as it always has been. %$* 645
what about drug addicts? %$* 645
it turns out that the small percentage of people who use drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than punishment for those people. %$* 645
most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might be a close second, but i think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right? %$* 645
if you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence. %$* 645
but is the answer to make using alcohol a crime? %$* 645
of course not. %$* 645
we tried that during prohibition and it just did not work. %$* 645
all we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we don't stop anybody now from using drugs. %$* 645
so i'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and also, my life experience. %$* 645
ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on drugs, but i want to respect you enough to keep it real. %$* 645
like most americans, i have used illegal drugs. %$* 645
i wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school in chicago, and at my catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed. %$* 645
the first time i was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at yale, where i went to college. %$* 645
and then at harvard, where i went to law school. %$* 645
i'm glad i never got caught when i smoked pot, and i'm also glad that barack obama was not arrested and prosecuted for any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana. %$* 645
my opponents are honorable men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach. %$* 645
as you listen to the good doctor theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind. %$* 645
he has actually prescribed heroin to addicts. %$* 645
he did it because he knows that addicts need to be treated, not punished. %$* 645
as a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is a medical issue, not a crime. %$* 645
and i read a profile of mr. %$* 645
hutchinson and he's a wonderful family man; i had the pleasure of meeting his wife, susan. %$* 645
and i wonder what a father, a great father like mr. %$* 645
hutchinson would say if one his children called and said she was using cocaine. %$* 645
would he really say, "wait a minute, honey," and whisper to his wife, "quick, dial 911, tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked up." of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends. %$* 645
so my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our children and our friends is good enough for african-americans. %$* 645
we call it a war on drugs but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked. %$* 645
last year in new york city, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 50,000, almost 90 percent were black or latino. %$* 645
that's not who really uses drugs. %$* 645
the national institute of health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any other group. %$* 645
they're about 12 percent of drug users. %$* 645
what about sellers? %$* 645
most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race. %$* 645
white kids in scarsdale, they don’t have to go to the hood to buy. %$* 645
they get their weed and ecstasy and adderall from other white skids in scarsdale. %$* 645
but who gets locked up for drug crimes? %$* 645
almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 60 percent of people who do the time. %$* 645
and that's selective prosecution, and it's devastated the african-american community. %$* 645
we have one black president and one million black people in prison. %$* 645
the book "the new jim crow" tells us that because of the war on drugs there are more african-americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850.think about the catastrophic effect that has on families. %$* 645
in the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside. %$* 645
so, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to not punish people for using drugs. %$* 645
the reality is, for my opponents, this will never-- %$* 645
this is just a nice rhetorical debate. %$* 645
the odds are that their children will use drugs, and they will never be touched by the criminal justice system. %$* 645
the odds for african-american children are very different. %$* 645
and that just seems profoundly unfair. %$* 645
my friends, as a civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick. %$* 645
we shouldn't put anybody in a cage based on what they put in their mouths. %$* 645
there's a better way. %$* 645
it's to legalize drugs. %$* 645
thank you. %$* 13
paul butler. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize drugs." and now here to speak against the motion, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
he is the ceo of the hutchinson group and a former congressman. %$* 13
he has served as administrator of the drug enforcement administration and as the first undersecretary for the department of homeland security. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 448
what an exciting evening to debate an important subject for our country and for our future. %$* 448
paul, great job in your opening remarks. %$* 448
an african-american who also happens to be in a leadership position in the united states attended the summit of the americas in colombia, south america. %$* 448
he said it is okay for us to debate the pros and cons of the war on drugs. %$* 448
but, quote, "i personally, in my administration, position is that legalization is not the answer," end quote. %$* 448
that was president barack obama. %$* 448
i happen to agree with president barack obama. %$* 448
i agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce our laws. %$* 448
i agree that we need to have a robust debate about incarceration policies and what we are doing in our fight against illegal drugs and how much we're devoting to rehabilitation. %$* 448
all of those issues are appropriate to be on the table. %$* 448
so there needs to be changes. %$* 448
paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement. %$* 448
that's why i have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powder cocaine disparity that impacts racially across america. %$* 448
we've reduced that disparity. %$* 448
we've made a correction to the system. %$* 448
we need to reduce our incarceration rates. %$* 448
that's why i'm engaged on the right on crime initiative and initiatives that encourage our state legislatures to look at incarceration policies. %$* 448
and in texas and in arkansas and in south carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both to save money, but also to reexamine our policies. %$* 448
i believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration. %$* 448
that's why i've been a supporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that it can be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across america. %$* 448
so why-- %$* 448
why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer? %$* 448
perhaps he understood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that drug use has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country. %$* 448
did he want to preside-- %$* 448
and i know people-- %$* 448
i see some skeptical looks when i say that. %$* 448
that is in your program. %$* 448
that is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years, drug use has been cut in half in our country. %$* 448
and we have a president that says he does not want to see it go up on his watch. %$* 448
could it be that he does not believe that the united states ought to break its treaty obligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe? %$* 448
and that is reason enough to vote against the proposition. %$* 448
or perhaps he was thinking about his own daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them to be engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in-- %$* 448
whenever we continue to have it illegal in our country? %$* 448
and so the president made that decision both personally, he said, and with his administration. %$* 448
let's look at the argument that's been presented. %$* 448
and first, i would say i've been introduced as a former administrator of the dea.that is absolutely true. %$* 448
i'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in arkansas that's prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of traffickers. %$* 448
and my experience is just the opposite of paul. %$* 448
in fact, when i went into a store recently to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "you put me in prison." i thought i was going to be thrown out of the place. %$* 448
but he looked at me, and he said, "i wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because i was going down the wrong path of addiction. %$* 448
i was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it turned me around." and today he owns his own business. %$* 448
and so i've had a totally different experience as former federal prosecutor. %$* 448
they say the current model of prohibition is not working. %$* 448
well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does not pass muster in close examination. %$* 448
in fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years. %$* 448
whenever you look at our war on poverty that president lyndon johnson proclaimed, what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty today? %$* 448
does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop fighting hunger? %$* 448
of course not. %$* 448
well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology. %$* 448
i believe it is an effort to save lives. %$* 448
it is our youth. %$* 448
it is our families, it is our communities at stake. %$* 448
how do you decrease harmful drugs in our community? %$* 448
is it by legalization or is it by our present method of saying, let's improve the system. %$* 448
let's make it better. %$* 448
but let's don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything legal. %$* 448
secondly, they talk about harm. %$* 448
if you believe that addictive and mind-altering drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that they are harmful, then ask this question. %$* 448
if you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs? %$* 448
now, if you believe that they're not harmful, i'm not sure i can win your debate. %$* 448
but if you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease usage? %$* 448
now, paul made the point that you look at-- %$* 448
you know more alcoholics today than you do people who are drug addicts. %$* 448
but did ending prohibition on alcohol increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the united states of america? %$* 448
and if you increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it? %$* 448
they cannot show-- %$* 448
and i believe the burden is on them-- %$* 448
they cannot show that logically and over history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go down. %$* 448
that has not been the experience in the netherlands. %$* 448
it's not been the experience in the united kingdom. %$* 448
it's not been the experience in alaska. %$* 448
it has not been the experience in canada. %$* 448
usage has gone up. %$* 448
and so, finally, in my opening, they ask me-- %$* 448
or paul mentioned my family. %$* 448
well, if my children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they getting those drugs? %$* 448
what is the availability? %$* 448
how can we shut that down? %$* 448
and as a parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability, increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as acceptable in our society as alcohol. %$* 448
that creates a problem as a parent in my mind. %$* 448
asa hutchinson, thank you very much. %$* 13
i have to acknowledge, i let you go over about 30 seconds because you were talking about your family and it just seemed that it would be so rude to step in and not let you finish. %$* 13
nick, if you need an extra 30, you've got it. %$* 13
well, i'm going to try and channel the methamphetamine that asa was talking about, so hopefully i'll need only about three minutes. %$* 646
all right, well-- %$* 13
you know-- %$* 646
before you start, because i want to introduce you, and i also want to tell our radio audience, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "legalize drugs." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third, debating in support of the motion, "legalize drugs," the editor-in-chief of reason.com and reason tv, he's the author of "the declaration of independents," t-s, and described as one of the foremost libertarians in america. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, nick gillespie. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 646
i do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in america means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that's basically it. %$* 646
you know, you've heard from a self described soldier in the drug war. %$* 646
you've heard from a general, a commander, former drug enforcement administration personnel in the drug war. %$* 646
you'll hear from a medic in the drug war. %$* 646
i present myself simply as a conscientious objector in the war on drugs. %$* 646
let me explain a bit of why i think we should legalize drugs. %$* 646
and the first-- %$* 646
i want to make two large points. %$* 646
first is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly-- %$* 646
you know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by christmas. %$* 646
this is what asa hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he's saying, "look, you know, it's been working pretty well these past 30 years. %$* 646
drug use is down. %$* 646
if we get rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up." so i want to talk about that. %$* 646
and then i want to address some of the things that paul previewed for you. %$* 646
and, first and foremost, i want to make this statement. %$* 646
and half of you in this audience, if you are representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference. %$* 646
you know, using drugs is not immoral. %$* 646
it is not addictive for 99 percent of people. %$* 646
and there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it. %$* 646
look, any program-- %$* 646
it's not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people. %$* 646
any program that has such disparate impacts as the ones that paul was talking about should come under scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions. %$* 646
as a 2005 cost benefit analysis of the war on drugs, by the super conservative american enterpriser institute, which looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by david boyum and peter reuter was american drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that john mentioned at the beginning of the program. %$* 646
and they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of thousands of people a year in jail are justified. %$* 646
another aei scholar-- %$* 646
and aei, you'll remember it from the iraq and afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a war it doesn't like-- %$* 646
mark perry, an economist at aei, has pointed out that between 1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat. %$* 646
in other words, we have become the world's largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes. %$* 646
the only other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going forward. %$* 646
across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and minds. %$* 646
a recent rasmussen poll just-- %$* 646
you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs. %$* 646
a century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 harrison narcotics act or controlled substances act, has finally woken americans up to the simple fact that prohibition exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate. %$* 646
it doesn't make things better, it makes everything worse. %$* 646
despite attempts to control-- %$* 646
to stem the supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation adjusted price goes down. %$* 646
as washington state and colorado were voting to legalize marijuana, californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders while they have to let rapists and murderers out. %$* 646
the rand corporation and other think tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards drugs and use rate. %$* 646
so in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates. %$* 646
in places like america we have stern drug laws and high use rates. %$* 646
it's not clear what's going on; we do know in portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more willing to come forward before they developed problems. %$* 646
so, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, also known as the loyal opposition here. %$* 646
well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an unconditional surrender in what is rightly called america's longest war. %$* 646
i want to make a brief case for what i call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult americans the broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies. %$* 646
and here is where i go into the meth round, because i'm running out of time. %$* 646
should be recognized. %$* 646
pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic right. %$* 646
over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all believe in what dupont used to advertise as "better living through chemistry." we take drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods. %$* 646
none of this is going away, nor should it. %$* 646
we do all sorts of things to make ourselves look and feel better. %$* 646
to the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better. %$* 646
ladies and gentlemen, if we don't have the right, literally, to change our mind through our personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn? %$* 646
now, drug legalization is not a scary prospect. %$* 646
it's not the radical change that its champions claim not its opponents fear. %$* 646
and let me-- %$* 646
as i'm winding down, how many of you have tried an illegal drug? %$* 646
raise your hand. %$* 646
anybody carrying? %$* 646
and if so-- %$* 646
okay. %$* 646
i'll talk to you later. %$* 646
i think it was about 100 percent. %$* 646
for use, not carrying, okay. %$* 646
because otherwise i think i see asa hitting "911" under the table. %$* 646
look, according to government statistics, fully 47 percent of americans over the age of 12 have done so. %$* 646
a population that includes, at least, the last three presidents of the united states, which, granted, may constitute the strongest argument against using drugs-- %$* 646
but drug use is a normal phenomenon, very few people become addicts. %$* 646
so when we are talking about what drug legalization would look like, first off, it's all marijuana use. %$* 646
vanishingly small people-- %$* 646
percentage of people use drugs other than marijuana. %$* 646
but let me just say, i'll close with-- %$* 646
there's not a single dimension across which pot is more dangerous than alcohol, which is pretty much all you need to know about a post- prohibition american society. %$* 646
it would be a lot like today, except that you would have one or two more choices in your medicine cabinet, and about 400,000 fewer people a year would go to jail; police would be able to focus on actual criminals and monday mornings would be a lot easier to face. %$* 646
so, please, think about legalizing drugs. %$* 646
thank you. %$* 646
nick, for our radio audience, how many hands did you see up? %$* 18
i think it was about 100 percent. %$* 646
for use, not carrying, okay. %$* 646
because otherwise i think i see asa hitting "911" under the table. %$* 646
look, according to government statistics, fully 47 percent of americans over the age of 12 have done so. %$* 646
a population that includes, at least, the last three presidents of the united states, which, granted, may constitute the strongest argument against using drugs-- %$* 646
but drug use is a normal phenomenon, very few people become addicts. %$* 646
so when we are talking about what drug legalization would look like, first off, it's all marijuana use. %$* 646

so, please, think about legalizing drugs. %$* 646
thank you. %$* 646
thank you, nick gillespie. %$* 13
and that's our motion, legalize drugs. %$* 13
and now, our final debater speaking against this motion, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
he's a retired doctor who practiced in an inner-city hospital and a prison. %$* 13
he's also a prolific writer and he's a fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or or methamphetamine, or heroine, or lsd, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms would be eliminated and very much reduced. %$* 647
and, incidentally, portugal has not legalized drugs, and no country has. %$* 647
anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from illegality. %$* 647
in this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning as from homicide. %$* 647
those people-- %$* 647
opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs obtained perfectly legally. %$* 647
about 15,000 a year die of these drugs. %$* 647
but the supply and demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years. %$* 647
and it was all nice and above board. %$* 647
there are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as i said, created perfectly legally. %$* 647
and this is all within a decade, more or less a decade. %$* 647
now, i suppose that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is. %$* 647
and if only the drugs were really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all would be well. %$* 647
well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that proposition. %$* 647
this example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous demand. %$* 647
another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called buprenorphine which is used very widely in france in the treatment of heroin addicts. %$* 647
and it's diverted to georgia. %$* 647
that's the ex-soviet union republic of georgia. %$* 647
according to the lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from france, which again shows quite apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous demand. %$* 647
our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally available in-- %$* 647
to the georgians, none of this would have happened. %$* 647
in scotland, as a whole, and in dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone, first developed to help the late hermann goering to get through the war without withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin. %$* 647
and this drug is used in supposed treatment of heroin addiction. %$* 647
so the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal drug. %$* 647
so it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality. %$* 647
we've seen that even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal to deaths from that trade. %$* 647
and that demand was created very, very quickly. %$* 647
it's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality of drugs. %$* 647
and again, this is not so. %$* 647
in the prison in which i worked, i discovered that the heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed-- %$* 647
they had committed between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took heroin. %$* 647
therefore, it will be more true to say that they were addicts because they were criminal than that they were criminal because they were addicts. %$* 647
this has been found elsewhere. %$* 647
and research shows that criminality is a better predictor of addiction than is addiction of criminality. %$* 647
and this can be seen from the career of the writer william s.burroughs, with which you might be familiar, who, as you know, shot his wife dead. %$* 647
he-- %$* 647
in my opinion, he was an even worse writer than he was a husband. %$* 647
but we don't have any time for literary criticism. %$* 647
the point is that he was fascinated by crime and committed criminal acts well before he became an addict. %$* 647
in the hospital in which i worked, i once walked into the intensive care unit to find two drug dealers who had shot each other at close quarters, but with thorough british incompetence, had failed to kill one another. %$* 647
well, what do you suppose that such people would be doing if they were not shooting at one another? %$* 647
would they have been doing remedial teaching, for example, or deciphering cuneiform script in the british museum? %$* 647
it's absurd. %$* 647
and criminal-- %$* 647
criminal gangs are not going to file for bankruptcy if drugs are legalized. %$* 647
they're going to change their activities. %$* 647
so making the importation or production, distribution, and sale of drugs would be dangerous, and it would not have the claimed benefits because the illegality of drugs is the occasion and not the cause of crime. %$* 647
and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, i ask you to vote against the motion. %$* 647
thank you, theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "legalize drugs."now we move on to round two. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing out this motion: "legalize drugs." the team arguing for the motion, paul butler and nick gillespie are arguing-- %$* 13
you've heard them say that basically partly it's a freedom thing that grownups have the right to put what they want in their own bodies as they do with the drug called alcohol. %$* 13
a lesson in history that criminalizing a drug is actually going to backfire. %$* 13
but beyond that, they say that the war on drugs, the embodiment of drugs as illegal costs in too many ways without a resulting drop in crime significantly, and that it disproportionately hits the african-american community in terms of people getting locked up behind bars simply for possession of drugs. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, asa hutchinson and theodore dalrymple, they're saying you cannot say that the war on drugs has failed, not when drug use among americans has dropped 50 percent in 30 years. %$* 13
they also point to the fact that drugs and crime and addiction go together. %$* 13
they point to prescription drugs, for example, which are legal. %$* 13
but their use is mired in crime and addiction. %$* 13
those are some of the arguments we've heard presented. %$* 13
and we're going to work through some of them in more detail now. %$* 13
and i want to go first to the team arguing against the motion to legalize drugs. %$* 13
your opponents have made the claim that the war on drugs as constructed really is a war on young black kids, that it is-- %$* 13
that the number of kids who are put in jail for drug possession, mere drug possession is just disproportionately high and has had terrible consequences on the community. %$* 13
and i want to know, does your side concede or refute that basic claim? %$* 13
asa hutchinson? %$* 13
well, i think it's an issue that has to continually be looked at. %$* 448
i think there was a disparity in penalties that impacted our african-american community when it came to crack and powder cocaine. %$* 448
we made a huge step forward. %$* 448
congress passed a remedy to that. %$* 448
i think there's been some challenges with the mandatory minimums that's made-- %$* 448
we've made some corrections in that as well. %$* 448
but you look at methamphetamine, it's such a huge problem across all of the midwest. %$* 448
that's predominantly a caucasian drug. %$* 448
it-- %$* 448
and that's where the law enforcement is enforcing its efforts right now. %$* 448
so i don't concede the point at all. %$* 448
but i think we-- %$* 448
you look at the african-american communities, and we have significant amount in arkansas. %$* 448
we have high poverty rates. %$* 448
we have high unemployment rates right now. %$* 448
we have many social problems that are impacted by the community. %$* 448
and it is reflected also in what happens in the drug world. %$* 448
all right. %$* 13
let's go to the other side. %$* 13
paul butler, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 645
it's just not true. %$* 645
asa makes it sound like blacks use drugs more than anybody else. %$* 645
and as anyone who's been to college or high school knows, it's simply not true. %$* 645
we really shouldn't be talking about legalizing drugs. %$* 645
we should be talking about re- legalizing them. %$* 645
for most of our history, drugs have been perfectly legal. %$* 645
you can go into a drugstore in the 1800s and buy opium. %$* 645
coca-cola started out with a cocaine derivative in it. %$* 645
so what made them become illegal? %$* 645
nothing to do with public safety. %$* 645
it was all about race. %$* 645
first drug criminalized, opium. %$* 645
san francisco, 1890, the concern was that chinamen were using it to seduce white women, can trace it right down the line. %$* 645
marijuana, mexican field hands. %$* 645
it was making them lazy. %$* 645
with blacks, it was that coke and ice. %$* 645
negroes were running rampant in the south. %$* 645
so our war on drugs is about race through and through. %$* 645
it always has been, and it is right now. %$* 645
but paul, you're saying that is the sole motive for it? %$* 13
i don't think that that's the only motive. %$* 645
but i think that when we look historically at how the drug laws have been used-- %$* 645
what happens to white people who use drugs? %$* 645
well, let me let the other side respond to %$* 13
methamphetamine that's predominantly a white drug that enforcement efforts across mid-america is directed at that. %$* 448
they're the ones that are impacted. %$* 448
but why don't prisons look like america then? %$* 645
that's not race based. %$* 448
that is across the board somebody who is engaged in methamphetamine production. %$* 448
that's who the prosecution's about. %$* 448
but in-- %$* 645
i have a question for you that i would like to ask, mr. %$* 448
moderator, john, that we didn't really cover this, and that is how legalization would work. %$* 448
if it's legalized tomorrow, i would assume that we would be able to go down and get our methamphetamines. %$* 448
well, i actually do want to come to that question, because i think it's a terrific one, but i just want to have these guys respond to the point you were just making on the race issue-- %$* 13
well, let me-- %$* 646
and the methamphetamine %$* 13
you know, i side with paul in a sense that the origins of drug prohibition, and many of the continuum policies are inextricably and i think incontrovertibly linked to race or other out group stigma. %$* 646
lsd became associated with young people in the '60s. %$* 646

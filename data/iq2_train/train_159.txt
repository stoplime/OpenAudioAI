and i have great respect for ruben’s professional wisdom as a foreign service officer. %$* 452
he was an excellent officer when he served under me, and he continues to be an excellent officer. %$* 452
ok, we understand. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 452
just in case %$* 452
yeah, yeah. %$* 13
if there was a little confusion there %$* 452
yeah. %$* 13
ok.i think there is an alternative, i think it is in the book. %$* 452
and of course, in the one or two minutes of the seven i had for this, i did try to lay it out. %$* 452
one of them has to do with not waging a war against all the cartels all the time, but concentrating on limiting collateral damage—that is, violence, kidnappings, corruption, etc.— without necessarily going after the drug trafficking itself, which is essentially what uribe has done in colombia. %$* 452
and i go back to the issue: there has been no reduction in coca leaf acreage in colombia over the past 10 years. %$* 452
second, creating a national police force so that you don’t have to use the army. %$* 452
every time we use the army, we get into human rights violations, we get into corruption of the army. %$* 452
this is a bad idea. %$* 452
we haven’t created a national police force. %$* 452
zedillo didn’t do it; fox, when i was in government, didn’t do it; and calderón hasn’t done it. %$* 452
and until we do that, it won’t work. %$* 452
and that’s another part of the alternative. %$* 452
ok. %$* 13
and the third part of the alternative is, once again, moving in the direction of decriminalization, so that we try and reduce the profits for that. %$* 452
and fourthly, yes, there is something to be done in truly sealing the border in mexico—not at the southern border with guatemala—but at the , which requires much more cooperation from the united states to do. %$* 452
what we’d be doing is just pushing the drugs out into the sea coming into the united states, but there is a good case to be made: drugs want to come to the united states because americans want to keep consuming them. %$* 452
what we in mexico are interested, quite honestly, is that they don’t come through mexico. %$* 452
hmmm. %$* 13
andrés, do you want to be very brief? %$* 13
i just want to very briefly take issue with jorge’s repeated insistence that this “war” started in december of 2006.yes, president calderón ratcheted up the effort, but as we have been discussing here tonight, this problem in mexico specifically—but in the broader regions, the region more generally—dates back many decades. %$* 451
and even the year before calderón took office in 2005, if you had been living in you would feel there was a helluva war going on. %$* 451
so i just wanted to make that clear. %$* 451
is there %$* 13
is there not a single woman in the audience who wants to ask a question here? %$* 13
ok. %$* 13
a single woman or a married woman? %$* 451
well, why are you wording it that way? %$* 13
but thank you for doing that %$* 13
hi, i am a student at nyu, my name is alexandria newton. %$* 456
thank you guys for being here, and it’s really great to have you on our campus. %$* 456
but i just wanted to ask. %$* 456
would either side believe, does %$* 456
does either side believe that the international drug wars could have been prevented if richard nixon and america didn’t declare that war on drugs? %$* 456
asa hutchinson. %$* 13
well, i really have problems with the language that richard—that president nixon used: “war on drugs.” i think that’s very unfortunate, because one, it implies an end; you like to have wars end; and secondly, it implies too much violence in that name. %$* 448
and so, i, as head of the dea, resisted using that; i like to use “the fight against illegal drugs.” the fight for our families. %$* 448
you know, reducing, use agent addictions. %$* 448
so i think that is very unfortunate. %$* 448
in terms of internationally, sure. %$* 448
the united states provides leadership whether it’s in the area of democracy and freedom, or whether it’s in trade. %$* 448
people do respond to the united states, so we have provided some leadership in terms of the fight against illegal drugs. %$* 448
but the bottom line is: each of those decisions— well, they would never do anything, just because the united states wants them to do it. %$* 448
you look at the netherlands, for example. %$* 448
the netherlands started down the path of decriminalization. %$* 448
they are toughening it up a little bit. %$* 448
they see some serious problems there. %$* 448
and so every country is making decisions on their own. %$* 448
but i would say, by and large, the consensus historically has been: drugs are harmful. %$* 448
let’s keep ‘em out of our families. %$* 448
the best way to do that is to keep them illegal. %$* 448
and that concludes round 2 of our debate. %$* 13
here is where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each, and it’s their last chance to change your minds. %$* 13
after you hear them speak, you will vote for the final time on where you stand on the motion. %$* 13
but to remind you of where you stood before the debate: before the debate, our motion being “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” 43 percent of you were for the motion, 22 percent were against, and 35 percent were undecided. %$* 13
we’ll have you vote again in just a few minutes. %$* 13
and we are a short time away from learning who is the winner of this debate. %$* 13
so round 3: closing statements. %$* 13
and first to summarize his position against our motion “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” asa hutchinson, former congressman, dea administrator, and undersecretary for the department of homeland security. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 448
and i am grateful for this chance to debate with my colleagues in respectful fashion. %$* 448
if i have been rude, please forgive me. %$* 448
it’s been a very healthy debate. %$* 448
i am a little bit startled by the push toward legalization because i don’t think that is particularly relevant toward the topic. %$* 448
the topic being: is america to blame? %$* 448
and quite frankly, if you would have asked the question, “does america have some responsibility, in terms of their drug consumption, as to the challenges that mexico faces,” i would have to agree with that. %$* 448
but i think that is totally different. %$* 448
and that’s not your decision today. %$* 448
it is: “is america to blame? %$* 448
” that implies that we are doing something wrong in our policy. %$* 448
and i don’t believe that we are. %$* 448
and secondly, it implies that somehow we have made mexico make these decisions. %$* 448
and i do not believe that the affirmative side has taken that burden of proof. %$* 448
they have not had any facts to support the proposition that somehow the united states has made calderón—president calderón—go after the drug cartels. %$* 448
i think the history is clear from everyone’s statements, that mexico—and rightfully so—stands tall among the sovereign nations of the world. %$* 448
it was their congress that has said drugs are illegal in their country. %$* 448
it is their culture that has resulted in the society they have that—which there is according to president calderón, a “culture of corruption” in that country—that they have to address. %$* 448
historically though, you have to go back 25 and 30 years and these problems are systematic. %$* 448
they are integral to the history of mexico. %$* 448
and the united states is not to blame for that. %$* 448
america is not to blame for what is being phased in mexico today. %$* 448
they say it’s because we have a consumption problem. %$* 448
that might be debate. %$* 448
i think the evidence is that marijuana use has declined from the ‘90s from 9.1 percent to 6.8 percent. %$* 448
asa hutchinson %$* 13
it might go up, it might go down. %$* 448
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
asa hutchinson. %$* 13
our motion is: “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” and now summarizing his position for this motion, fareed zakaria, editor of newsweek international, and host of cnn’s fareed zakaria gps. %$* 13
thank you all very much. %$* 447
and i want to tell you an anecdote. %$* 447
i was in singapore about 15 years ago and the leader of singapore, lee kuan yew—a tough guy who runs a pretty tough shop—was coming under some pressure because he had very strict drug testing programs in singapore. %$* 447
and he explained the problem to me this way. %$* 447
he said, “you see, you americans look at things very differently than we do. %$* 447
when you have a drug problem, you look around and say, ‘well, where are the drugs coming from? %$* 447
panama. %$* 447
let’s go in and invade panama, arrest the president, put him in jail, and that’s how we’ll solve the drug problem.’ ” he said, “i don’t have that option in singapore. %$* 447
i have got to actually deal with the problem i have in my society. %$* 447
and for that reason, i am going to have intrusive drug testing.” i raise this to make two points. %$* 447
one, you don’t have to believe in decriminalization to believe that we are exporting this problem and have been exporting the war and the criminalization from the caribbean through colombia, and now into mexico. %$* 447
but the more important point i want to make—and i urge you %$* 447
you know, it’s often you could look at these things as games. %$* 447
it is very important that america own up to its responsibilities. %$* 447
that we not push the blame on one more poor country, on one more neighbor. %$* 447
that we recognize that we do have something to do with what is going on. %$* 447
this is a disease in american foreign policy, it is a disease in american society. %$* 447
and it is very important that you and the vote you make—and we as a society— own up to it. %$* 447
there is this wonderful quote from fitzgerald’s gatsby that i always remember about tom and daisy buchanan. %$* 447
he says of them—as typical americans—he says, “they were careless people, tom and daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.” let’s not be like that. %$* 447
let’s take responsibility. %$* 447
thank you, fareed zakaria. %$* 13
“america is to blame for mexico’s drug war” is our motion. %$* 13
and summarizing his position against that motion, chris cox, chief lobbyist for the national rifle association. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 450
what’s clearly not to blame is america’s second amendment or the lack of some law to outlaw what’s already illegal on both sides of the border. %$* 450
to even suggest that this criminal enterprise has anything to do with our rights is absurd. %$* 450
it’s preposterous. %$* 450
so let me be clear where we come from. %$* 450
do we support the current administration’s proclaimed conviction to hunt down and root out the drug cartels? %$* 450
absolutely. %$* 450
do we feel for the poor mexican people who are being terrorized by narco terrorists? %$* 450
they are abandoned by their own officials. %$* 450
they are left defenseless by their own, their own government? %$* 450
of course we do, passionately. %$* 450
but we are going to give up our second amendment rights on some empty promise that’s going to—this is going to make the mexican people safer? %$* 450
not now, and not ever. %$* 450
our rights don’t endanger anyone—and they make this country freer, safer, and a lot more stable than other countries around the world, including mexico. %$* 450
american law enforcement can work with the mexican government, should work and does work with the mexican law enforcement to bring people to justice who break the law. %$* 450
collectively, we have the tools, we have the intelligence, we have the manpower, but what we apparently lack is the guts—that straight and high integrity to tell each other the truth on all these issues. %$* 450
until we get to that point, until we can look each other in the eye and tell the truth and be honest, this whole question is irrelevant. %$* 450
thank you. %$* 450
thank you, chris cox. %$* 13
summarizing for our motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” jeffrey miron, a senior lecturer and director of undergraduate studies in the department of economics at harvard. %$* 13
again, thank you very much for being here and for listening. %$* 449
let me start by conceding some elements of merit in my opponents’ points. %$* 449
first, i think mr. %$* 449
cox is absolutely right, u.s.gun policy has nothing to do with the issue. %$* 449
there would be just as much of a drug war, just as much violence, if we banished u.s. guns; the guns would come from somewhere else. %$* 449
i think mr. %$* 449
hutchinson has a fair point. %$* 449
countries are meant to be sovereign. %$* 449
mexico could, in principle, say “we don’t care what u.s.policy is. %$* 449
we don’t care about nafta.we don’t care how much the u.s.is harassing us. %$* 449
we are going to legalize drugs,” or “we are going to de-escalate our own drug wars, because that’s a sensible thing to do.” in principle, could they do that on their own? %$* 449
yes. %$* 449
would they come under enormous international pressure and u.s. pressure? %$* 449
absolutely. %$* 449
so i think he is painting much, much too optimistic a case. %$* 449
i think that jorge castañeda has a very valid point. %$* 449
certainly, the situation got much worse when calderón escalated, ok? %$* 449
and the degree to which you try to enforce a “drug war” plays a huge role in how bad it is. %$* 449
many european countries have laws which are not so different than the u.s.laws, but they basically do almost nothing to try to enforce them. %$* 449
they leave the cartels, they leave the suppliers basically alone, and they don’t get nearly the magnitude of the violence and other negative side effects. %$* 449
so there is certainly a valid point there as well. %$* 449
i would also note, i think, that four of the six of us here could agree that we would have liked the question to have been, “should the u.s. and mexico de-escalate their war on drugs,” ok? %$* 449
and i think the three of us here—along with jorge—would all agree with %$* 449
in the affirmative for that. %$* 449
so perhaps we can have another discussion on that point. %$* 449
but at the end of the day, the fact is that the u.s.—throughout the last 90 years—has done everything in its power to push its puritanical, prohibitionist message and policy on the rest of the world, mexico being very much at the forefront, and going back well before felipe calderón. %$* 449
so yes, america is to blame for the for the drug wars in mexico. %$* 449
thank you, jeffrey miron. %$* 13
summarizing against our motion, jorge castañeda, former foreign minister of mexico, and here at new york university, professor of political silence—sorry, political %$* 13
as my students can testify %$* 452
yes, yeah. %$* 13
well, let me finish, let me finish my windup for you, without the freudian slip. %$* 13
jorge castañeda, former foreign minister of mexico, and professor of political science and latin american studies at new york university. %$* 13
i am very glad to hear at this point that, yes, at least four of us— and i am not so sure, well, perhaps, well, the rest of my members of my team would disagree entirely that the way this war has been declared, waged and is being fought, perhaps was not the most intelligent idea and that perhaps a series of modifications should be made. %$* 452
but in any case, on the fundamental issue. %$* 452
i think that if we accept the premise that the united states is to blame for the war—which i do not, because as i said, i think this is president calderón’s war, and it did begin now. %$* 452
the previous six presidents of mexico have contained with more or less corruption, more or less violence, more or less intelligence, the cartels, but did not declare this generalized war on them. %$* 452
the first time that has happened is now. %$* 452
the question is: is there any change in the united states’ situation %$* 452
in the last two or three years %$* 452
that has had a direct impact on mexican production, violence, corruption, etc.? %$* 452
and there is no evidence of that. %$* 452
i would just respectfully disagree with my colleague asa on the question of u.s.demand. %$* 452
fareed brought it up, and he is right. %$* 452
i don’t know what “demand” has been, but i do know—from dea figures—that the price of drugs in the united states over the last 40 years has tended to decrease for all drugs. %$* 452
now, it may be that some “demand” has dropped and prices have also dropped, but that is hard to argue directly. %$* 452
my sense is that, overall, demand has been more or less stable for all drugs, except for changes within them. %$* 452
and on the gun question, i also think that there is no significant change. %$* 452
it’s not that all of a sudden there are more guns going to mexico. %$* 452
there are a lot though. %$* 452
fareed, i would tend to disagree with “the 2,000 per day,” that’s 700,000 per year. %$* 452
that would be two million, just in the past three years. %$* 452
the numbers don’t add up. %$* 452
and by the way, there are three million registered guns in mexico, including those of the government. %$* 452
there are more than two and a half billion registered, legal gun owners in mexico today. %$* 452
as my students can testify %$* 452
thank you, jorge castañeda. %$* 13
and finally, with our motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” summarizing for the motion, andrés martinez, director of the new america foundation, bernard l. schwartz fellows program, and a former editor at the l.a. times. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 451
and again, i want to reiterate my appreciation for your being here and for the rosenkranz foundation for hosting this important forum. %$* 451
first off, i just quickly wanted to take issue again with jorge on this question of whether the drug war started under president calderón. %$* 451
and yes, there was a “surge,” if you will—or a “frontal declaration against all cartels, all the time,” as you put it. %$* 451
but i think the alternative %$* 451
it’s very cynical to say, “well, the government should have continued accommodating with these cartels.” and clearly, this day of reckoning was in the offing when— sooner or later. %$* 451
but i think, again, america is to blame for the violence, for the war. %$* 451
asa hutchinson said, “we offered no facts, we offered no evidence.” i just point you again to a 65 billion dollar consumption demand for this, these illicit drugs in this country. %$* 451
i think the fact that we have spent so much time talking about whether or not to legalize is indicative—and again, i am agnostic on that question—but i think it’s indicative that we all understand that the root cause here is the fact that we have this massive market in this country for a product that we have also made illegal. %$* 451
65 billion dollars is more than 5 percent of mexico’s gdp.according to jorge’s fantastic book, mexico has a consumption—illicit drug consumption rates—that are below international averages. %$* 451
only 5 percent of mexicans have ever tried illegal drugs, compared to 42 percent of americans. %$* 451
when i was a kid, they used to make stamps, “mexico exporta,” stamps of export products. %$* 451
they could have %$* 451
might as well made illicit drugs. %$* 451
this is all about supply and demand. %$* 451
it’s all about supplying the american market. %$* 451
90 percent of the cocaine that is consumed in this country now goes through mexico, because of some of the shifts that fareed mentioned earlier. %$* 451
we have to accept that our actions have consequences. %$* 451
we can’t constantly outsource the repercussions of our hypocrisy. %$* 451
please accept responsibility and vote with us that america is to blame for mexico’s drug war. %$* 451
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side argued best. %$* 13
you are going to choose our winner. %$* 13
once again, going to the keypads near your seat. %$* 13
you voted before the debate. %$* 13
your position on our motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” we would like to ask you to vote once again on this position, having heard the arguments. %$* 13
press number 1 if you support the motion, number 2 if you are against, and number 3 if you remain or became undecided. %$* 13
the motion, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” and it looks like everyone is done. %$* 13
we are going to have the results probably in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
in the meantime, i want to tell you what’s coming up in our next season. %$* 13
first of all, i want to thank all of you in the audience and our panel for a compelling discussion and for arguing honestly, fairly and good naturedly. %$* 13
so this is our last debate of 2009.and looking forward to 2010, here is what we are going to be debating at this point in our spring series. %$* 13
on january 19th, our motion is “california is the first failed state.” it will feature former governor gray davis and van jones, who recently left his post as white house environmental advisor. %$* 13
on february 9th, the motion is “the u.s. should step back from its special relationship with israel.” we are going to have new york times columnist roger cohen and columbia university pressure—or professor rashid khalidi, and israel’s former ambassador to the united states, itamar rabinovitz. %$* 13
on march 16th, the motion is “don’t blame teachers unions for our failing schools.” we’ll have former education secretary rod paige. %$* 13
april 13th, “organic food is marketing hype.” we’ll have blue hill chef dan barber, and vogue food writer jeffrey steingarten. %$* 13

individual tickets and packages are now available by visiting our web site, and at the skirball box office. %$* 13
and make sure to become a fan of intelligence squared u.s. on facebook, and you will receive discount on next season’s debates. %$* 13
and finally, a special thank you to npr and to bloomberg television for distributing the iq2 debates this season, and to our media partner newsweek magazine. %$* 13
don’t forget to pick up a copy on your way out. %$* 13
and now it is in. %$* 13
you have voted twice. %$* 13
and i have just been given the results. %$* 13
remember, the side that changes the most minds here will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion has been, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” before the debate, 43 percent of you were for the motion, 22 percent of you were against, and 35 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 72 percent of you are for the motion, 22 percent remain against, and 6 percent undecided. %$* 13
the side for the motion wins. %$* 13
congratulations to that side. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

all right, so ladies and gentlemen, let's get started. %$* 13
and to get to the "why now" about this debate, i'd like to welcome to the front seats of this stage the chairman of the board of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
good evening, john. %$* 1
good evening. %$* 13
so what is at the heart of this particular debate tonight? %$* 13
well, i'm reminded of a quotation i always liked from john kenneth galbraith. %$* 1
he said that politics is the art of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous. %$* 1
and that indeed is the choice that we face in the middle east, and it's the subject of this debate. %$* 1
so we're looking at elected islamists versus dictatorship. %$* 13
on the dictatorship side, what's the pro and the con on dictatorship? %$* 13
well, the pro of dictatorship is a lot of these dictators are fairly reliable allies of the united states. %$* 1
the con is that they are greedy, that they stay in power with repressive means, intrusive security services, secret police, violence against dissent. %$* 1
and the pro and con of the islamists? %$* 13
well, the pro of the islamists is simply that they are elected. %$* 1
and democracy is, of course, a core value of ours. %$* 1
but we think of democracy as liberal democracy. %$* 1
and what we see in the middle east is what i might call-- %$* 1
what fareed zakaria called "illiberal democracy." that's democracy without freedom of speech, without free exercise of religion, without a clear rule of law and so forth that really represent our core democratic values. %$* 1
and let's go to the "why now." why now for this debate? %$* 13
well, john, two words: egypt and syria. %$* 1
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, that's robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you, bob. %$* 13
and that's the shape of our debate. %$* 13
you can just come through the side. %$* 13
and a round of applause once again for our debaters. %$* 13
and i'd just also like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz because he made all of this possible. %$* 13
look what happens when we add three little letters of the alphabet together. %$* 13
i, s, as in sugar, m as in money, -i-s-m, ism. %$* 13
you take that word, and you'll pin it to some perfectly delightful and innocent sounding nouns, and you can end up in the middle of a political argument. %$* 13
social, socialism; active, activism; sex, sexism . %$* 13
you get the idea. %$* 13
when this happens with religions, it turns a religion into a political movement with a political agenda. %$* 13
and then you really have a debate as we do tonight, another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
welcome. %$* 13
our motion is this: "better elected islamists than dictators." we have four superbly qualified debaters who have lived this issue for years from well before arab spring. %$* 13
and they will be bringing to you their arguments for and against this motion. %$* 13
let's now meet our debaters. %$* 13
first, reuel marc gerecht is a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracies. %$* 13
and your partner is brian katulis. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the center for american progress. %$* 13
"better elected islamists than dictators" is our motion. %$* 13
and the team arguing against this statement, zuhdi jasser, who is president of the american islamist forum for democracy. %$* 13
and your partner is daniel pipes who is president of the middle east forum. %$* 13
our motion is "better elected islamists than dictators." and let's meet our debaters one by one. %$* 13
let's welcome first reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
that was one of those applause lines. %$* 13
the warmth of your reception overwhelms him, but i just want to do it one more time. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
let's welcome first reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
and, reuel, you are a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracy. %$* 13
you are a former media specialist at the cia's directorate of operations, now the national clandestine service. %$* 13
you also have the distinction of having been on the very first panel of our intelligence squared series six years ago when the motion was, "we must tolerate a nuclear iran," and you were against that motion. %$* 13
in the '90s, you wrote a book about your own story. %$* 13
you wrote it under a pseudonym about your own story about getting smuggled into iran. %$* 13
and for our radio listeners who do not realize that you're over six feet tall, question is "how does somebody so big sneak into iran? %$* 13
painfully. %$* 410
i was two inches taller back then. %$* 410
on your side, also arguing for the motion, "better elected islamists than dictators," brian katulis. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the center for american progress. %$* 13
you have been studying, brian, the middle east since your days as undergraduate. %$* 13
actually you lived in amman, jordan, as did i a long time ago, but you were a fulbright scholar. %$* 13
i was just a journalist. %$* 13
in the '90s you also lived in the west bank, the gaza strip, and you were in egypt doing work for the national democratic institution for international affairs, and considering your breadth of experience and the depth of your experience as actually having lived there, did you ever see back then that something like arab spring could actually coalesce and happen? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 411
it's like watching gravity take place. %$* 411
you have a young population there, and what we're seeing right now is the start of something that's going to unfold for years to come. %$* 411
it was always going to happen. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 411
all right. %$* 13
our motion is, "better elected islamists than dictators." and here to argue against that motion, i'd like to introduce zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
zuhdi is a doctor. %$* 13
he specializes in internal medicine and in nuclear cardiology. %$* 13
for 11 years you were a medical officer in the u.s.navy. %$* 13
you're a devout muslim and founded the american islamic forum for democracy in response to the attacks on september 11.zuhdi, you are not the first person in your family to become a political activist. %$* 13
where did the inspiration come from for you? %$* 13
well, it really came from my grandfather. %$* 412
my mom really used to say-- %$* 412
says actually frequently that it's in my genes. %$* 412
he was a businessman who was active and prolific in writing columns in syria and was in and out of house arrest for doing so. %$* 412
and now we know the rest of the story of what's happening in syria. %$* 412
and you come by this honorably. %$* 13
your partner. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 412
daniel pipes, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and, daniel, you are president of the middle east forum. %$* 13
you founded it back in 1994.now, you were set off to be a quiet college professor. %$* 13
you actually have two degrees in medieval islamic history from harvard. %$* 13
you wrote a book on colloquial egyptian grammar. %$* 13
and academia beckoned, and yet, somewhere along the line you got into the islam-watching game. %$* 13
what happened? %$* 13
to put it differently, the university didn't want me. %$* 413
the university didn't want me because, as i like to put it, i have the politics of a truck driver. %$* 413
all right, ladies and gentlemen, daniel pipes and all of our debaters. %$* 13
so this is a debate. %$* 13
this is a contest. %$* 13
these debaters are here to try to persuade you of the power of their arguments. %$* 13
and you, our live audience, will act as the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote two times, once before the debate and once again afterwards debate-- %$* 13
after the debate on the language of this motion, "better elected islamists than dictators." let's have the first vote happen now. %$* 13
as you come in off the street, before hearing any of the arguments, we want to know where you stand on this motion, "better elected islamists than dictators." if you agree with it, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you push a key by mistake, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
that was a piece of cake. %$* 13
we will hold that result until the end of the debate when we have you vote a second time on the power of the arguments that have been persuaded. %$* 13
and the team that has changed its numbers the most in the course of the evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so on to round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
and speaking first in support of the motion, "better elected islamists than dictators," reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
he is a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 13
he served as a specialist in the cia's directorate of operations and is the author of several books, including "the wave: man, god, and the ballot box in the middle east." ladies and gentlemen, reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
it's a pleasure to be here. %$* 410
last time i did iq squared in london, i actually laughed so hard during the debate, i pulled a muscle on stage. %$* 410
i will endeavor to be more restrained this evening. %$* 410
i also notice that it's impossible they didn't give me a glass of wine. %$* 410
in london you could actually drink wine will you did the debate. %$* 410
so let me just say, one, it's an honor to be here with daniel pipes. %$* 410
i read daniel's dissertation-- %$* 410
i think it was over 30 years ago now-- %$* 410
on slave soldiers, which actually is a very important and unappreciated part of islamic history. %$* 410
daniel and i have actually debated this issue years ago, when a little book i put out called "islamic paradox" came out. %$* 410
so it's good to be here with him again. %$* 410
and let me sort of restate the resolution. %$* 410
i think what daniel and zuhdi are really saying is that better dictatorship forever than allow the muslim common man, woman to elect islamists in a free vote. %$* 410
now, that's a pretty, i think, ironic position for them to take, because what they're essentially saying is they want to perpetuate the political systems which have allowed islamic fundamentalism, including its most radical offshoots, jihadism, most famously al-qaida, to actually grow stronger. %$* 410
it is no accident that islamic radicalism has grown enormously during the period of dictatorship, secular dictatorship, throughout much of the region. %$* 410
it has been jet fuel for that cause. %$* 410
the societies that have been ruled by dictators and kings with ever coarsening, i think, rigor have very-- %$* 410
have harmed their societies, have caused, more or less, an ethical collapse. %$* 410
i mean, a good personal anecdote of this is when i was in cairo and i was a student there at the american university of cairo in 1980.i can say that not a single woman at that school was veiled. %$* 410
and that was a good thing, because they were babes. %$* 410
i mean, they were hot. %$* 410
i've never seen so many beautiful women in one spot. %$* 410
and 20 years later, i think it's fair to say, under mubarak, that probably 20 percent, or even more maybe, were veiled. %$* 410
now, why is it the social composition of that school hasn't changed at all, these are women of the elite. %$* 410
why would women of the elite actually start veiling themselves? %$* 410
because they should be the ones who should embrace the dictatorship because it has allowed them certain social liberties that would not exist under an islamist system. %$* 410
i think the answer to that is that they were protesting. %$* 410
they were protesting the political order. %$* 410
they were protesting the social order. %$* 410
they were protesting the ethical order, that it had become disgusting. %$* 410
and i think if you-- %$* 410
it's interesting to then- to look north and look at where, i think, daniel, and perhaps zuhdi too, would once upon a time have said were the best hope for the islamic world, and that would be turkey. %$* 410
all right? %$* 410
because turkey really had the model that everybody in the foreign policy community on the left and the right really liked. %$* 410
that was the model that you would have enlightened dictatorship. %$* 410
you have someone like mustafa kemal ataturk. %$* 410
he would come in and, through force of arms, literally, change the society, create the social basis for a more liberal order, and, boom, down the pike you would have liberal democracy. %$* 410
now, guess what's happened in turkey? %$* 410
you haven't seen the triumph, actually, of liberals yet in the ballot box. %$* 410
for the last almost 10 years, you've seen the islamist party win. %$* 410
as the elections became ever freer, as the generals moved off, guess who became the dominant party, the akp, the justice and development party, which is an islamist-- %$* 410
i think daniel would call it an islamist party. %$* 410
so what that ought to tell you is that under no circumstances are you going to create a liberal order in the middle east without bringing along the faithful. %$* 410
you cannot have a dictatorship who will take the traditions of the past and will take the ulama, the religious scholars, and throw them in the dust bin or throw them in jail. %$* 410
the only way you're going to get a more liberal order in the middle east is through people of faith. %$* 410
it is through the fundamentalists participating in the system that you're actually going to develop the jousting ethic that is going to allow liberals to have greater chances. %$* 410
it's only through them participating that you're going to have people become responsible for politics. %$* 410
now, daniel – another good book that daniel wrote was actually about conspiracy. %$* 410
and if all those who know the middle east at all, you know that the middle east is hobbled by conspiracy. %$* 410
it's known as toovtdie in persian, they call it toovtdie jewy conspiracy mongering, searching for conspiracies. %$* 410
it is literally, as daniel would tell you, it's a cancer on society. %$* 410
now, why do they have that? %$* 410
they have that because the political order is dictatorial. %$* 410
it is what-- %$* 410
everything that is important that happens happens, as the iranians say, pushte powde it happens behind the curtain. %$* 410
only by people becoming responsible, by having, as they say in the arabic and in persian, masuliat can you drive away conspiracy, can you create a more healthy order. %$* 410
there's no way you can have that under dictatorship. %$* 410
you are always going to have dependent people. %$* 410
you're always going to have people who are ridden with conspiracy. %$* 410
so if you want to create that order, perpetuate that order, what daniel is in fact saying is he's going to create an order, there's going to be more conspiracy. %$* 410
it is you have to bring in some type of democratic system and allow these people to evolve. %$* 410
and they might also say evolution is not possible with islamists. %$* 410
well, we know, at least looking in the case of iran-- %$* 410
and we don't know yet what's going to happen in the arab world. %$* 410
we don't know what's going to happen in egypt. %$* 410
we don't know what's going to happen in tunisia. %$* 410
but we can tell that in iraq under a theocracy, under a dictatorship, there has been a profound change that you have fallen revolutionaries everywhere. %$* 410
i do not have time to go into the number of them, but it is an ocean. %$* 410
it is a tidal wave of people who were once hard core islamists who have abandoned the faith or who have evolved their faith and have become pretty profound democrats, if not liberals. %$* 410
they still exist in the dictatorial society. %$* 410
but they are-- %$* 410
you have seen the explosions in 2007. you saw them in 2009. you saw it in 1997, mohammed akbi so i suggest to you if you want to see evolution, you cannot be in favor of-- %$* 410
create a dictatorship which can only promise you stagnation. %$* 410
thank you. %$* 410
thank you, reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
our motion better is "better elected islamists than dictators." and here to argue his position against the motion, daniel pipes. %$* 13
he is president and founder of the middle east forum which publishes the middle east quarterly and sponsors campus watch, islamist watch and the legal project. %$* 13
he's the author of 12 books. %$* 13
and his biweekly columns are read around the world. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel pipes. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 413
and let me return the compliment to reuel. %$* 413
i learned much from his books on iran and particularly the book that was alluded to before his entry, his smuggling-- %$* 413
being smuggled into iran. %$* 413
he has certainly got us off to a rousing start. %$* 413
now, the good news, ladies and gentlemen, is that we basically agree on the fundamentals. %$* 413
none of us like dictators. %$* 413
we all want liberal democracy. %$* 413
none of us like conspiracy theories. %$* 413
so the question is not one of principle. %$* 413
the question is really one more of tactics. %$* 413
how do we achieve liberal democracy in the middle east? %$* 413
and as you've just heard, the argument for elected islamists is that this flushes out the system, and you have responsibility, and you have progress. %$* 413
i will argue the opposite case, not because i'm against responsibility and progress but because i think that the islamists, whether elected or not, whether violent or not, islamists of any sort whatsoever are barbarians, are totalitarians, are far worse than dictators. %$* 413
you're not going to look to me to find an apologetics for dictators. %$* 413
they're execrable, they're horrible, they're brutal, they're miserable. %$* 413
but the islamists, elected or not, are even worse. %$* 413
one can distinguish between those dictators who are greedy. %$* 413
in fact, robert rosenkranz used that very word before. %$* 413
they're greedy. %$* 413
they're interested in their own welfare. %$* 413
they have huge amounts of money stored away. %$* 413
they invite mariah carey in to sing their birthday song. %$* 413
they keep pet lions in their backyard. %$* 413
they have lots of cars and planes. %$* 413
it's the good life. %$* 413
they're greedy. %$* 413
and in the pursuit of this greedy goal, they are going to harm you if you get in their way. %$* 413
but if you don't get in their way, they'll leave you alone. %$* 413
they don't have a vision. %$* 413
they don't particularly cooperate with each other. %$* 413
and they often do cooperate with us because they don't have any particular hostility towards us so long as we don't get in their way. %$* 413
now, that's bad. %$* 413
there's no apology from me on that. %$* 413
but the ideological dictators, be they fascist, communist or islamist are far worse because they wish to impose their vision. %$* 413
they wish to create a global hegemonic state, in this case, caliphate, another case, an international communist state or nazi state. %$* 413
they have a vision for the new human being who they will redo. %$* 413
and if you get in their way, they will-- %$* 413
even if you don't get in their way, if you disagree with them, they will be brutal with you. %$* 413
and if dictators are bad and kill thousands, ideological dictators, nazis, communists and islamists kill millions and even tens of millions, tens of millions. %$* 413
mao, stalin, saddam hussein and so forth. %$* 413
these are people with a vision how they're going to change society. %$* 413
so i argue that we're better off with plain old greedy dictators who can evolve, who do evolve if they're pushed, who are not that terrible to their population, who we can work with. %$* 413
we're far better off with them than we are with the ideological ones. %$* 413
so in short, the motion that's before us, "better-- %$* 413
" if you agree with this motion, "better elected islamists than dictators," you are in effect saying that you also agree with the idea that the motion, "better elected nazis than dictators.” adolph hitler was elected, was he not? %$* 413
these are the same people. %$* 413
these are totalitarianists. %$* 413
these are people who will limit freedom for a much longer period of time. %$* 413
now, it's true, as reuel pointed out, that in 1980, one did not see the islamist surge in egypt that one does today. %$* 413
no question. %$* 413
and i agree with him that the dictatorship was part of it. %$* 413
i wish that our government and other western governments had pushed hosni mubarak to open up. %$* 413
and i believe we could have had a quite different outcome had we done so. %$* 413
we were irresponsible in being his colluders, his accomplices. %$* 413
we should have been pushing towards civil society. %$* 413
we should have been pushing towards voting and freedom of expression and minority rights and independent judiciary and loyal opposition. %$* 413
we should have been doing all those things, and we didn't. %$* 413
and thus we have the terrible results we have. %$* 413
so my first premise, my first guideline for american policy is always deal with dictators and push them in the right direction towards an open society. %$* 413
secondly, always support our friends. %$* 413
we do have friends. %$* 413
we do have people who agree with us. %$* 413
be they the demonstrators in iran in june of 2009 who were against the dictatorship of the mullahs or the people in tahrir square last year who were against mubarak. %$* 413
if you listen to them, they're in favor of the things we have. %$* 413
they want democracy. %$* 413
they want civil society. %$* 413
they want responsibility. %$* 413
and it is our burden not only to help them materially but to help them morally, to work with them, to always, always help them. %$* 413
even though they're far from the corridors of power and will not achieve-- %$* 413
will not reach rule any time soon, they are the hope for the middle east. %$* 413
they are the ones who can pull the region out of its current mire, and we must always support them. %$* 413
so one, work with dictators, but push them towards civil society and democracy. %$* 413
two, always help the liberal elements. %$* 413
and three, always, always, always oppose the islamists. %$* 413
they are our worst enemy. %$* 413
and whenever they come in, they are our enemy, and they are the enemy of the subjects that they rule over. %$* 413
and reuel mentioned turkey. %$* 413
yeah, turkey has become islamist, as he mentioned. %$* 413
for the last 10 years, one sees a turkey which was always imperfect under the other parties, has under the akp become far more dictatorial than it had been for, far more hostile in its foreign relations with state actors, states on its peripheries, has the largest number of journalists in the world that are in jail and the like. %$* 413
so in short, if we want to get to liberal democracy, which we all agree upon, the thing to do is to work with the dictators and improve the dictators and slam the door on the totalitarians and the ideological dictators. %$* 413
work with the greedy dictators and slam the door on the ideological dictators who will put the region into even worse shape than it is today. %$* 413
thank you. %$* 413
thank you, daniel pipes. %$* 13
a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening statements of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: "better elected islamists than dictators." you have heard two of the opening arguments, and now onto the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce brian katulis. %$* 13
he is a fellow at the center for american progress. %$* 13
he has served as a consultant to numerous government agencies, private corporations, non-governmental organizations, on issues related to the middle east and south asia. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, brian katulis. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 411
it's really great to be here tonight, and i can promise in this debate we're not going to talk about the debt, i'm not going to talk about my grandmother, i'm not going to talk about your tax rates, we've got a really juicy topic. %$* 411
and i'm going to break it down into three main points, why you should vote in favor of the proposition and not against us. %$* 411
number one, no dictatorship can maintain the status quo that we see in the middle east right now. %$* 411
a vote for the proposition would be a vote to accept reality. %$* 411
a vote against the proposition is a vote to stick your headiu in the sand. %$* 411
although i suspect much of the debate tonight will focus on the middle east and north africa, it's important to note that this region of the world actually represents a minority in the vast muslim world. %$* 411
it's about 20 percent of the entire population of muslims in the world. %$* 411
six in 10 muslims actually live in the asia-pacific region. %$* 411
muslim majority countries like indonesia and malaysia have activist islamist political parties and systems that work. %$* 411
so the debate over whether islam and democracy is compatible is the persistent charm of an irrelevant question, one that's no longer relevant. %$* 411
in the middle east right now we're in the very early stages of a transition that i think will last for years. %$* 411
and a year and a half into these uprisings we've only seen four leaders fall out of about 19 or 20, depending how you add them up. %$* 411
and you've seen only serious infighting in the five or six countries, but you look at the crushing demographic political and economic conditions that these countries face, no dictator can hold that back. %$* 411
and i think you look at the political dynamics in places like egypt and tunisia, it's quite natural to see why islamists did very well for reasons that were well explained. %$* 411
they were suppressed, and the debates in these societies were pushed to the dark corners of the mosques. %$* 411
and that debate was radicalized, and, yes, there is a threat from radicalized islam. %$* 411
but it is the consequence of dictatorships, the very thing that if you vote against the proposition you will be voting in favor of that and continuing that sort of system. %$* 411
it's simply not sustainable. %$* 411
number two, elected islamists will change in response to the politics. %$* 411
and i think tonight we'll talk a lot about statements that elected islamists will say. %$* 411
what i'm focused on are the people, and i lived over there, and i understand that the basic needs, basic security, jobs, and other things will drive politics, maybe not in the early stages, maybe when things get a little rough they'll be a little ideological, but, by and large, islamist politicians will be politicians, and we will need to support this long effort to actually push them to face the same pressures and constraints that other politicians face around the world. %$* 411
and the open debates that we have like the open debate we're having here tonight in intelligence squared, i think this forum is phenomenal. %$* 411
i've watched it now a number of times. %$* 411
and these sorts of open debates expose the voices of fear, expose the voices of hatred and demonization in ways that i think clarify. %$* 411
and this is what these societies in the middle east are just starting to experience. %$* 411
so, again, a vote for the proposition is a vote for the possibility of change in these societies. %$* 411
a vote against it, it's for the status quo, which, as we said, is unsustainable and has harmed us. %$* 411
now, i hope we get into this debate over a liberal democracy. %$* 411
you talked about it a little bit early on. %$* 411
and certainly we shouldn't be naïve. %$* 411
there's a very real risk that if we simplistically define democracy as the ballot box and going to the ballot box, you could see christian minorities, other religious minorities, women see their rights suffer. %$* 411
but my argument, again, against that and against the arguments of one man, one vote, one time, which is often brought up, is that that threat in the context of this debate tonight, the proposition you have to vote for or against, there's an inherent contradiction there, because if the biggest threat resulting from elected islamists is a dictatorship that imposes upon the human rights and basic rights of individuals, you've got a dictatorship. %$* 411
so at the core of the argument of our opponents tonight is that contradiction we need to deal with. %$* 411
third point, elected islamists, not dictators, will defeat the radical ideologies of groups like al-qaida. %$* 411
now, i think we've done a damn good job over the last three or four years going after al-qaida, and i know that's a debatable proposition among a lot of people. %$* 411
but i think the targeted strikes and other things, that's a separate debate, which i hope intelligence squared has. %$* 411
but if you look at what's going on ideologically in the battle of ideas, al-qaida, over the last three decades, essentially, has tried to build its ideological platform on two core pillars. %$* 411
number one, tapping the popular discontent with dictators. %$* 411
number two, anti-americanism. %$* 411
that's a combustible mix, and breaking that, and having the people in the region break that, i think, is extremely powerful. %$* 411
the fact that al-qaida and its affiliates had virtually nothing with the removal of leaders in places like egypt and tunisia and the widespread calls for political reform and the battles that are still going, i think, is telling. %$* 411
the fact that ayman zawahiri, the head of al-qaida, wrote a book attacking the muslim brotherhood for actually participating in democratic politics is telling. %$* 411
looking ahead, it seems that al-qaida's popular appeal, i think, will remain low, given that many of the protesters are out there supporting democratic reforms. %$* 411
people are going to the ballot box, the very thing that radical jihadists are opposed to. %$* 411
so i'm going to close up here. %$* 411
i must say that we're faced with a great opportunity here. %$* 411
the popular uprisings in the middle east. %$* 411
and, again, we'll probably focus on that, because it's the hot topic, and it's the most uncertain, and reuel and i agree that there's no clear path forward. %$* 411
and i think we're probably going to have a couple of steps back. %$* 411
we're going to see these countries fight with this all along. %$* 411
but tonight, if you vote against this motion, your vote is essentially saying-- %$* 411
remember those good old days when muammar gaddafi was in power in libya? %$* 411
remember those good old days? %$* 411
remember when he repressed and killed thousands of his own citizens, when he actually used the veil of islamism at different times and passed laws in the name of islam to try to establish his credibility? %$* 411
remember muammar gaddafi used terrorists who actually bombed airlines and killed hundreds of americans around the world, setting off the sorts of things that i think we're debating here tonight. %$* 411
remember that? %$* 411
then vote against the proposition. %$* 411
a vote for the proposition, is it a clear, certain proposition that we're going to see liberal democracy appear? %$* 411
i can't guarantee you that. %$* 411
but i actually think it's a better pathway forward than sticking with dictatorships. %$* 411
thank you. %$* 411
thank you, brian katulis. %$* 13
our motion is, "better elected islamists than dictators." and our final debater against the motion, zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
zuhdi is the founder and president of the american islamic forum for democracy. %$* 13
he is also a doctor and a former medical officer in the u.s.navy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 412
it's a privilege and honor to be here. %$* 412
and thank you, mr. %$* 412
rosenkranz, for your vision and this wonderful platform. %$* 412
daniel covered the history and the choices before us in the middle east. %$* 412
i'll give you a deeper, more personal analysis of, really, one of the terms that i think has been thrown around here quite a bit, but, yet, it doesn't seem that our opposition understands, which is islamism. %$* 412
and this motion, i cannot tell you enough, as a muslim and as an american, how important it is that we not get this wrong, because we're sitting right now at a tipping point in the middle east, and if we get this wrong and we start to think, "well, the islamists are better than the dictators," we're going to then usher in even worse totalitarianism and dictatorship. %$* 412
you know, one of the old sayings was that hope springs eternal. %$* 412
and certainly one of the american concepts we've always had is that we want to be hopeful; we want to see progress. %$* 412
but i'll tell you, as a muslim, i'm insulted at people who believe that islamism is progress for me as a muslim, that somehow the theocrats and those with robes that memorize their scripture, that somehow know how to run democracy, when, in fact, it's an illusion. %$* 412
i think one of the things our opposition hasn't even begun to tell you is how they can trust one word that the islamists tell them. %$* 412
they're deceptive theocrats who will do anything to monopolize and control our societies. %$* 412
and i think one of the things our opposition seems to be doing-- %$* 412
and if you vote for this motion, you'd be basically voting for the fact that, somehow, they want you to believe that we support dictators. %$* 412
and that's not why i'm on this side. %$* 412
i'm on this side of this equation because islamists are not better than dictators, because we have been sentenced to two evils in the middle east: islamic fascism and secular fascism. %$* 412
they both supported one another. %$* 412
they fed off one another. %$* 412
they're one and the same. %$* 412
and for our opposition to tell you that, somehow, boom, the dictators exit stage left, and what you're left with is a spring that you can plant new plants and soil, and somehow that the islamists, that somehow they come out of reform, is just hogwash. %$* 412
the islamists are a product of dictatorship, as, actually, they said. %$* 412
so now, all of a sudden, we're going to put our hope for reform into not only people the people that came out of that environment, but people that have thrived in monopolizing and feeding off of a dictatorial mindset. %$* 412
but add one more very important component, a sense that they have a mandate from god, a sense that they know our faith. %$* 412
they know islam, and they know how to put into place sharia or islamic law, and they will do it not only for their country, they'll do it for the 56 other countries in the oic, the organization of the islamic cooperation, and they'll thus do it for the world. %$* 412
this is far more dangerous than a simple dictator. %$* 412
so you need to understand what islamism is if you're going to vote for or against this motion. %$* 412
and once you understand that islamism is no different than what our founding fathers fought against when we fought against theocracy in this country, you'll realize that fighting against theocracy is the only way to achieve liberty. %$* 412
and i as a muslim who loves my faith and loves my scripture, if i want to see our societies-- %$* 412
i mean, listen, my family fought against dictatorship in syria. %$* 412
we understand what it is. %$* 412
and you see it today with over 30,000 killed and hundreds of thousands of displaced. %$* 412
but american influence-- %$* 412
please don't underestimate the influence that america can have if we try to tip this equation one way or the other. %$* 412
and if you believe that there's a third pathway for muslims and for all those minorities and women and others in the middle east, then you must vote against this motion. %$* 412
you must vote that islamists are not better than dictators. %$* 412
they come from the same cloth. %$* 412
and islamists actually-- %$* 412
actually are dictators on steroids. %$* 412
you know, ultimately, i think we have to remember that if you're going to vote with the opposition for this motion, you're going to believe that somehow you can have hope with islamists. %$* 412
forget what they say, forget what they believe. %$* 412
forget what the mantra is of the muslim brotherhood. %$* 412
forget what they are saying from their pulpits, what they are saying from the government. %$* 412
forget that the oic just last week gave us directions on how to deal with our own first amendment that it's too critical of islam and muslims. %$* 412
forget the fact that women have less and less rights the more the clerics get in control. %$* 412
forget the fact that the minorities are ousted, the fact that the jewish population and coptics and others, the more islamists get in control, the more minorities vacate the premises in those countries. %$* 412
somehow we need to divorce ourselves from the reality of what islamists do and say that they're a gateway into a future of hope for the middle east. %$* 412
that's certainly not a gate that i want to walk through. %$* 412
and it's certainly, i don't think, a gate that the people that are giving their lives in the arab revolutions, in the arab spring, which are really just convulsions against dictators, the people that are marching on the streets are not doing that to be handed over to islamists. %$* 412
and if they did-- %$* 412
if you vote for this motion, you are basically telling them that, okay, this dictator, this theocrat, because he uses religious language, is better for you. %$* 412
and we're going to help them. %$* 412
and by the way, if you believe in american credibility and soft power, american soft power in the middle east is lower than it's ever been. %$* 412
the reason secretary clinton had tomatoes thrown at her car a few months ago was because the people of the arab spring saw us helping out the brotherhood, saw us basically cozying up to the islamists. %$* 412
and the islamists did not win that election. %$* 412
they only got 25 percent of the vote, and then there was a runoff. %$* 412
so remember the elections, that's the other part of this motion. %$* 412
we have to also look at what it means to be elected. %$* 412
the non-islamists are divided into so many parties that the majority, 75 percent of egypt and a majority of tunisians did not vote with the islamists the first time around. %$* 412
but then when a runoff happened, they ended up voting between the islamists or the old dictators, and they wanted some kind of change shall and they ended up voting for the islamists. %$* 412
so that's the other thing is, if you want to resign them to just two choices, both of which none of us want, i think ultimately you must vote for. %$* 412
if you want to give them a third choice, a third path, that being of liberty, i believe you should vote against. %$* 412
and you'll not see the egypt islamist president morsi, for example, criticizing terrorist groups like hamas or iran or saudi arabia, even though he may give flowery language of parliamentary democracies and talking about women's rights, et cetera. %$* 412
but yet when push comes to shove-- %$* 412
just a few years ago, he was a truther, a conspiracy theorist. %$* 412
just a few years ago-- %$* 412
and just actually a few months ago, he's already met with the heads of hamas and other radical islamists. %$* 412
so this is a guy who's consolidating his power, not only in egypt, but globally. %$* 412
islamism is what pushes him to consolidate power globally. %$* 412
and i think this is why you should vote against the motion. %$* 412
thank you. %$* 412
thank you, zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
so now we go on to round two. %$* 13
and round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this: "better elected islamists than dictators." arguing for the motion, we have reuel marc gerecht and brian katulis. %$* 13
they have been arguing that you need to bring these guys into the political process because, number one, it's happening anyway. %$* 13
dictators are in free fall. %$* 13
they're doomed. %$* 13
these people are the political process. %$* 13
they represent the faithful. %$* 13
the faithful represent this community. %$* 13
and that once in power, they will evolve the responsibility of having to serve the needs of people and clothe and shelter them, will cause them to evolve, to separate into factions, and that their societies will gradually open. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, daniel pipes and zuhdi jasser are arguing that islamists are-- %$* 13
cannot be reformed, that they are intolerant, they are barbaric, they are totalitarian, far worse than any dictator, that they are deceptive and will do anything they can to stay in power. %$* 13
i want to put to the side arguing for the motion a premise that has been brought up by your opponent, daniel pipes, essentially saying that the-- %$* 13
and these-- %$* 13
this team is clearly not pro-dictator. %$* 13
they're not celebrating dictatorship. %$* 13
they don't like it. %$* 13
they're talking about a lesser of two evils. %$* 13
and in making that argument, they make the case that at least dictators can be worked with. %$* 13
it's a single individual, i assume is part of your argument. %$* 13
the u.s.may have leverage over dictators in some cases, that they can be worked with, and change can come about that way. %$* 13
and i'd like the side arguing against them in support of elected islamists to take that on. %$* 13
reuel marc gerecht. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 410
it's pretty hard to find an instance where you can find the united states successfully encouraging a dictatorship to evolve liberally in the middle east. %$* 410
daniel said, "i wish we had." well, of course i wish we had. %$* 410
i wish we had taken the shah-- %$* 410
had we put more pressure on him so he could have evolved and developed elections so you wouldn't have had a revolution. %$* 410
i mean, i just have to say this, daniel's premise is that by the mighty hand of the united states, we're going to discover these hidden liberals in the middle east. %$* 410
and suddenly, through america's nurturing, these liberals are going to come forward and defeat the people of faith. %$* 410
i just don't-- %$* 410
that's not the middle east i know. %$* 410
it makes no sense whatsoever. %$* 410
you cannot import into the middle east liberal ideas and liberal codes of justice, swiss legal codes and create liberals. %$* 410
it has to come organically. %$* 410
all right. %$* 13
it has to be through the ballot box. %$* 410
daniel pipes. %$* 13
but we did do that. %$* 413
we did that in turkey, for example. %$* 413
we pushed the turks away from the autocracy that they had in the '40s towards the pretty good democracy of the 1990s. %$* 413
and we've done it around the world. %$* 413
i grant you-- %$* 413
and who won the election? %$* 410
marc, let him finish. %$* 13
we've done it less in the middle east than elsewhere. %$* 413
but let me mention, for example, south korea or taiwan or brazil. %$* 413
there are many places around the world where we have done that. %$* 413
and we didn't do it in egypt, and that's a big mistake we made. %$* 413
but brian suggested that we're advocating for stagnancy. %$* 413
but i think you heard me loud and clear. %$* 413
and reuel just quoted me. %$* 413
i wanted to push-- %$* 413
today i want to push in algeria and morocco and saudi arabia, i want to push. %$* 413
i want them to open up. %$* 413
but i think they're saying that-- %$* 13
that in this case in the middle east, they cannot be pushed. %$* 13
of course they can. %$* 413
are you saying that they cannot be pushed successfully? %$* 13
no, i think you can push. %$* 410
but let's just take turkey. %$* 410
i mean, turkey is the ideal. %$* 410
they elected an islamist party. %$* 410
i mean, what would you have done differently in turkey? %$* 410
as you just said, the 1990s created a more liberal order. %$* 410
guess what happens? %$* 410
the people freely vote and bring in the islamists. %$* 410
so i don't see-- %$* 410
if turkey's not going that way, how is egypt, which is far less westernized, which has been much farther from the european tradition. %$* 410
brian, hang on a second. %$* 13
zuhdi jasser. %$* 13
yeah, you continue to use the old paradigm as if somehow all we have is to look backwards. %$* 412
and i think if there's any message from the arab spring, it's please stop looking backwards at the old and look at the new in that the arab spring was a grassroots revolution. %$* 412
it wasn't about the old either clerics or the dictators. %$* 412
there are new choices there. %$* 412

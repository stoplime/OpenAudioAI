we have time for another question from the audience, and, somewhere in the, somewhere in the back, i can’t see. %$* 33
hello. %$* 10
hi. %$* 33
so according to a 2007 pew study, over 60 percent of muslims in america identified as moderate, and i was hoping that— %$* 10
identify as, excuse me? %$* 33
moderates. %$* 137
so i was hoping that asra can elaborate a little bit on it, why again are %$* 137
why is islam dominated by radicals? %$* 137
because— %$* 472
asra nomani. %$* 33
like i said before, i mean this is not a conversation about the majority of muslims. %$* 472
we’re talking about whether islam is dominated. %$* 472
dominated to me means institutional islam, it means the people who are running our mosques, the people who are running our—our organizations. %$* 472
it means, this establishment that it call wahabism incorporated, that is basically not just, you know, a pocket, an empty—an empty anecdote. %$* 472
it is an empire out there in the world that is defining our community. %$* 472
this isn’t a popularity contest about whether we want moderate expression of islam or not. %$* 472
this is about who’s running our communities. %$* 472
and i can tell you that institutional islam is representing a radical ideology that may not represent what most of muslims believe, but at the end of the day, it’s not worth the trouble for most muslims to battle them. %$* 472
i can tell you from the trenches, the struggle to battle that kind of institutional islam is painful. %$* 472
you lose status, you get death threats, you get all sorts of abuse. %$* 472
and this is what happens whenever you challenge the authorities, and right now the authorities represent radical islam. %$* 472
closing statements from all six panelists now, two minutes each, and then we’ll have you vote on these arguments that you’ve heard, starting with a panelist against the motion, “islam is dominated by extremists,” reza aslan. %$* 33
i guess the question has to be once again, what exactly are these radicals dominating—asra nomani has said that they’re dominating action, that is demonstrably false, because that would mean that what we’re seeing in every country in the muslim world is this radical, collective action, which of course takes part in political violence, in terrorism, which is simply not true. %$* 471
i mean that’s demonstrably false, that is not the majority of the actions that we’re seeing. %$* 471
paul marshall has said that it is the states that dis—islam is, or radicals are dominating, that again is demonstrably false. %$* 471
besides the fact that one third of the muslim world lives in democracy, the—besides the fact that, of the most populous muslim countries in the world, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, bangladesh, lebanon, senegal, these are all quite successful democratic states— %$* 471
one. %$* 33
—and that in those countries that we do see a real sort of movement of political, one could even say radical islam, they’re all in response to secular autocracies in which the mosque is the only free space in society, and the only opposition is religious opposition. %$* 471
daveed has said it’s the institutions that the muslims are radical in, this again is demonstrably false, the iman declaration, 170 of the world’s leading clerics and scholars representing every single sect and schism of islam came together, issued fatwas out—outlawing violence in the name of islam, outlawing calling anyone a takfir or an apostate, the same thing happened in the mecca declaration a year after that, the same thing happened earlier in this year with the king of jordan. %$* 471
so in every single one of these issues, the idea that something is being dominated is demonstrably false. %$* 471
so we can talk about our sort of visions of what islam brings up, you know, the visions of warfare and them. %$* 471
but the— %$* 471
i guess the question has to be once again, what exactly are these radicals dominating—asra nomani has said that they’re dominating action, that is demonstrably false, because that would mean that what we’re seeing in every country in the muslim world is this radical, collective action, which of course takes part in political violence, in terrorism, which is simply not true. %$* 471
i mean that’s demonstrably false, that is not the majority of the actions that we’re seeing. %$* 471
paul marshall has said that it is the states that dis—islam is, or radicals are dominating, that again is demonstrably false. %$* 471
besides the fact that one third of the muslim world lives in democracy, the—besides the fact that, of the most populous muslim countries in the world, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, bangladesh, lebanon, senegal, these are all quite successful democratic states— %$* 471
thank you— %$* 33
—fact is when you think about it in its historical sense and its factual, objectifiable— %$* 471
reza— %$* 33
—observafiable sense, it just doesn’t make any sense— %$* 471
thank you, reza aslan, for your closing statement, paul marshall, arguing in favor of the motion. %$* 33
okay, yes, we do argue it is a question of institutions, who is controlling organizations. %$* 470
course one of those major and the most powerful of those organizations, is states. %$* 470
though not just them. %$* 470
we’ve spoken not just about saudi arabia, we’ve spoken about iran. %$* 470
compared to the situation of 30 years ago, whereas a— with a radical islamic regime you basically, just had the saudis, at least a large one. %$* 470
then you had iran. %$* 470
then you’ve had sudan. %$* 470
then you’ve had radicalization in pakistan which has continued. %$* 470
you’ve had events in somalia. %$* 470
you’ve had events in nigeria. %$* 470
if you look at places where more radical movements are not per se the government, but are increasing influencing it, and are more powerful and have established themselves as the opposition, we see this in egypt. %$* 470
we see this in algeria. %$* 470
we see this in malaysia. %$* 470
we see this in indonesia. %$* 470
and in each of those countries we see an increase— %$* 470
one. %$* 33
—of violence. %$* 470
so in each of these settings, compare the situation 20 years ago, and the situation now. %$* 470
if you look at movements amongst muslims, say amongst the palestinians, amongst the chechnyans, around kashmir, in the philippines, in thailand, in lebanon %$* 470
you’ve had movements that are opposing the government. %$* 470
usually it was in terms of national liberation or political freedom or access to resources. %$* 470
now in each of those a shift towards a more radical islamic emphasis. %$* 470
we see this across the board, in setting after setting. %$* 470
it is now more radical than it was then. %$* 470
of course there’s a push-back, from jordan. %$* 470
i’ve been involved in some of these conferences. %$* 470
similarly with turkey, similarly with morocco, with indonesian organizations. %$* 470
but they cannot mask—so far, i hope they will—but so far they cannot mask the power, the resources, which are arrayed against them. %$* 470
currently, in the war of ideas— %$* 470
okay, yes, we do argue it is a question of institutions, who is controlling organizations. %$* 470
course one of those major and the most powerful of those organizations, is states. %$* 470
though not just them. %$* 470
we’ve spoken not just about saudi arabia, we’ve spoken about iran. %$* 470
compared to the situation of 30 years ago, whereas a— with a radical islamic regime you basically, just had the saudis, at least a large one. %$* 470
then you had iran. %$* 470
then you’ve had sudan. %$* 470
then you’ve had radicalization in pakistan which has continued. %$* 470
you’ve had events in somalia. %$* 470
you’ve had events in nigeria. %$* 470
if you look at places where more radical movements are not per se the government, but are increasing influencing it, and are more powerful and have established themselves as the opposition, we see this in egypt. %$* 470
we see this in algeria. %$* 470
we see this in malaysia. %$* 470
we see this in indonesia. %$* 470
and in each of those countries we see an increase— %$* 470
thank you— %$* 33
—within the muslim world, the radicals are winning. %$* 470
paul marshall. %$* 33
and now, a closing statement from edina lekovic. %$* 33
in the war of ideas, the moderates are the ones who have regained the ground since 9-11, both in internationally recognized leaders, and in the feelings and the sentiments of the people on the ground. %$* 473
and it is those people on the ground, 1.3 billion of them, who dominate and define the religion of islam. %$* 473
as do the recognized religious leaders who are, as we mentioned, time and again, pushing for a new form of tolerance, and more and greater dialogue with other religious institutions as well as state powers. %$* 473
let us not confuse islamic states, for—and misunderstand them as anything other than the two-thirds of them that are dictatorships. %$* 473
the argument on the table is not whether the muslim world is ruled by dictatorships. %$* 473
it most certainly is. %$* 473
but that is not the question on the table, the question is whether islam itself, and therefore, the global population of muslims, are dominated— %$* 473
one— %$* 33
—by radicals. %$* 473
radicals are failing in their attempt to dominate. %$* 473
the moral bankruptcy of the militants as well as their abject failure in socioeconomic terms has strengthened the leaders of moderate, predominantly muslim nations, just like turkey, like indonesia, like malaysia, in their struggle against religious radicalism and backwardness. %$* 473
let us remember again the people on the ground who make up the dominant force within islam, and who have wrestled back control over their faith and are continuing to do so. %$* 473
are they the absolute, at—the 100 percent at this point, absolutely not. %$* 473
but they make up the dominant side and they say, according to gallup, that the most important thing that westerners can do to improve relations with their societies, is to change their negative views toward islam, and respect muslims and islam. %$* 473
in the war of ideas, the moderates are the ones who have regained the ground since 9-11, both in internationally recognized leaders, and in the feelings and the sentiments of the people on the ground. %$* 473
and it is those people on the ground, 1.3 billion of them, who dominate and define the religion of islam. %$* 473
as do the recognized religious leaders who are, as we mentioned, time and again, pushing for a new form of tolerance, and more and greater dialogue with other religious institutions as well as state powers. %$* 473
let us not confuse islamic states, for—and misunderstand them as anything other than the two-thirds of them that are dictatorships. %$* 473
the argument on the table is not whether the muslim world is ruled by dictatorships. %$* 473
it most certainly is. %$* 473
but that is not the question on the table, the question is whether islam itself, and therefore, the global population of muslims, are dominated— %$* 473
thank you, edina lekovic, for that closing statement against the motion, now with a closing statement for the motion, “islam is dominated by radicals,” is asra nomani. %$* 33
“regain the ground,” “wrestled back our communities,” i don’t think so. %$* 472
a christian or jew cannot go into mecca, because you’re banned. %$* 472
a woman cannot travel in %$* 472
to mecca, because of the laws of the land that say that she has to have a chaperone. %$* 472
the men in our community have decided that in fact their radical version of the ideology allows them to, to retain power. %$* 472
you can call it an autocracy, you can call it dictatorships, you can call it anything you want, but it is radical and it is dominating our communities. %$* 472
just look at the example of the south, in the 1930s let’s say. %$* 472
civil rights %$* 472
let’s exchange the words of our proposition. %$* 472
the south was dominated by white supremists at that time. %$* 472
would they have been the majority? %$* 472
maybe not. %$* 472
but they controlled the churches, they controlled the cops, they controlled the laws, they controlled the power structure. %$* 472
one— %$* 33
that’s what we’re talking about. %$* 472
our laws, our power structure, our cops, our clerics, are all on the payroll of an ideology that is radical. %$* 472
and it’s an issue of great pain to me as a muslim, it’s an issue of great sadness. %$* 472
it breaks my heart that this is the reality and the truth, and it’s an ugly truth. %$* 472
but, i challenge you, to accept it, because even though it’s ugly, it’s only when we’re honest about it that we’re actually gonna be able to change the world so that this reality, where muslims regain the ground and take back our communities, will actually happen one day. %$* 472
it hasn’t happened yet. %$* 472
and, i can only hope that it will happen. %$* 472
but right now, we are not, we have not won the war, and the struggle continues, and i assure you that we are in the struggle. %$* 472
“regain the ground,” “wrestled back our communities,” i don’t think so. %$* 472
a christian or jew cannot go into mecca, because you’re banned. %$* 472
a woman cannot travel in %$* 472
to mecca, because of the laws of the land that say that she has to have a chaperone. %$* 472
the men in our community have decided that in fact their radical version of the ideology allows them to, to retain power. %$* 472
you can call it an autocracy, you can call it dictatorships, you can call it anything you want, but it is radical and it is dominating our communities. %$* 472
just look at the example of the south, in the 1930s let’s say. %$* 472
civil rights %$* 472
let’s exchange the words of our proposition. %$* 472
the south was dominated by white supremists at that time. %$* 472
would they have been the majority? %$* 472
maybe not. %$* 472
but they controlled the churches, they controlled the cops, they controlled the laws, they controlled the power structure. %$* 472
asra— %$* 33
thank you. %$* 472
—nomani, thank you. %$* 33
and now richard bulliett, your closing statement. %$* 33
i have some problem squaring what asra has just said, with what paul marshall started with. %$* 475
he started by saying, that %$* 475
islam is okay, most muslims are okay. %$* 475
like, nothing against islam, nothing against most muslims. %$* 475
but that, the people who are dominating are those who are striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of islam. %$* 475
now we get to asra, who just says that it’s true there are these dictatorships, these are totalitarian states, these are the autocracies, and autocracy is radical. %$* 475
and therefore radicals dominate islam, well, but that radical %$* 475
you know, that isn’t the radical that paul’s talking about. %$* 475
there is nothing in the government of syria or the government of egypt or the government of most of the other autocracies in the muslim world, that is in favor of striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of islam. %$* 475
in fact, most of these governments are— %$* 475
one. %$* 33
—dead opposed, to this sort of version of islam. %$* 475
they’re trying to have what they call secular nationalist states, you can talk about the baath party in syria, you can talk about the tunisians, you can talk about virtually every country except saudi arabia and iran. %$* 475
but, you can’t get away with the idea of saying that, radicals dominate islam because all—all autocrats are radical. %$* 475
that may be true. %$* 475
but that’s very different from saying that, what’s dominating islam, which is the proposition of your team, is a particular version of islam. %$* 475
we can agree, that autocracy is the besetting problem of islam in that many of the reactions that you have, come as reactions to autocracy, and, just one word on the women. %$* 475
every muslim political group i know that is striving to find elections in the muslim world, believes that all women should have the vote equally to men. %$* 475
i have some problem squaring what asra has just said, with what paul marshall started with. %$* 475
he started by saying, that %$* 475
islam is okay, most muslims are okay. %$* 475
like, nothing against islam, nothing against most muslims. %$* 475
but that, the people who are dominating are those who are striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of islam. %$* 475
now we get to asra, who just says that it’s true there are these dictatorships, these are totalitarian states, these are the autocracies, and autocracy is radical. %$* 475
and therefore radicals dominate islam, well, but that radical %$* 475
you know, that isn’t the radical that paul’s talking about. %$* 475
there is nothing in the government of syria or the government of egypt or the government of most of the other autocracies in the muslim world, that is in favor of striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of islam. %$* 475
in fact, most of these governments are— %$* 475
richard bulliett, thank you very much for your closing statement and now, the last of the closing statements, from a supporter of the motion, “islam is dominated by radicals,” daveed gartenstein- ross. %$* 33
in this debate we’ve defined hegemony in two ways. %$* 474
we have defined it as being hegemony over institutions, and hegemony over states. %$* 474
now, richard bulliett in his last speech finds a contradiction, in that he says that the autocratic governments aren’t actually islamic. %$* 474
now, here’s a statistic that asra put forward previously in the q&a, which is important. %$* 474
about one billion of the world’s muslims live in muslim-majority countries. %$* 474
there are 22 countries, in which islam is declared the state religion. %$* 474
a look at the numbers shows that about 602 million muslims—that’s 58 percent of those living in predominantly muslim countries—live in places where islam is the state religion. %$* 474
so, the autocracies are indeed enforcing islam. %$* 474
that’s one thing that they’re doing. %$* 474
but it’s not just the autocracies. %$* 474
it’s the institutions. %$* 474
the institutions are important as well. %$* 474
and their argument, as bulliett expressed in his last opening speech, is that for all the reasons given to you by the other side, vote against the motion, it comes down to a question of what hegemony means. %$* 474
and the only person on this side who tried to defend—to define hegemony, is richard bulliett. %$* 474
one— %$* 33
who said hegemony requires a majority. %$* 474
well, by that logic, everyone on that side has talked about how the us is a hegemon. %$* 474
does that mean that the majority of people in the world are then americans? %$* 474
of course not. %$* 474
the fact is here, that if you look at where power is, power is in the hands of those who are trying to enforce a particularistic view of islam. %$* 474
look at the institutions, look at the anti-apostasy laws. %$* 474
look at anti-blasphemy laws. %$* 474
look at the prohibition on evangelism. %$* 474
look at prohibitions on free speech. %$* 474
this is not a pretty situation. %$* 474
and it’s important to recognize where the power lies. %$* 474
that’s what we’re asking you to do. %$* 474
we’re asking you to vote for the resolution, to identify the challenges that all of us, all debaters acknowledge, lay ahead. %$* 474
and that’s why i would like you to vote for this resolution. %$* 474
thank you. %$* 474
in this debate we’ve defined hegemony in two ways. %$* 474
we have defined it as being hegemony over institutions, and hegemony over states. %$* 474
now, richard bulliett in his last speech finds a contradiction, in that he says that the autocratic governments aren’t actually islamic. %$* 474

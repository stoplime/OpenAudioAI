—everything, uh— %$* 366
the—the question from the audience was, things that we could do, correct me if i’m wrong, andrew, things that we could do without much pain that would stave this off— %$* 79
well— %$* 103
either you’re talking about— %$* 79
well, what— %$* 366
—revolution, anything necessary. %$* 79
the real problem is— %$* 103
philip stott— %$* 79
—there’s no social discounting in this, let’s get a bit of economics in. %$* 103
so in fact, if you—if you have an increase now, and you take inflation into account, what you’re doing is an average world, um, income at the moment of $7,500. predicted by a—a distance ahead, that will rise to about $88,000, you knock off what in fact the stern report in britain estimated, as in fact the cost of global warming, 13.27 or so percent, it comes down to something like, uh, 70-something thousand dollars but even taking inflation account that is still a massive increase in wealth so what you’re actually asking in economic terms, is what is strange but a poorer generation to sacrifice a great deal for what will in any case, even with global warming cares, be a wealthier generation. %$* 103
the thing is that companies right now when they reduce heat- trapping emissions they find profits that keep giving back to them because, right now we’re so wealthy in many nations of the world that we are wasting energy because we can afford to. %$* 366
and the reality is many companies are saving lots of money when they make small investments to reduce their emissions, dupont did 50 million to invest, they’re getting 2 billion on return on that investment, and it keeps on giving, so, it’s not an economic %$* 366
argument. %$* 366
anything else from the anti side that you think might be %$* 79
the, the— %$* 32
—consensus, uh, good for us anyway kind of measures that they might agree to? %$* 79
right. %$* 365
energy conservation— %$* 365
gavin schmidt. %$* 79
everybody is gonna agree that energy conservation is a good thing and it should be encouraged. %$* 365
um, right. %$* 365
that’s three heads nodding on this side? %$* 79
yeah. %$* 362
you’re gonna argue with energy conservation— %$* 365
two—all right, two, two and a half. %$* 79
two and a half heads, that’s good enough. %$* 79
go—go on, richard somerville. %$* 79
you know, a lot of things could be done, once you free up the creativity of, uh, of technical people, of business people by making this a priority nationally and internationally, the problem isn’t that there’s nothing that can be done, the problem is that, the people who are asking for your vote haven’t heard loudly enough that this is an important issue to the electorate, so it’s way down on people’s priorities, that’s the reason for the lip service that michael crichton talked about, people are a lot like, like mark twain, they’re all for progress but are opposed to change. %$* 363
let’s go— let’s go back to the audience, someone on this side, do we have someone lined up on that side? %$* 79
okay. %$* 79
thank you, my name is heather higgins, i’m not a scientist, so, pardon my ignorance when i hear the scientistic—scientific establishment believes in something i immediately think of flat- earth consensus, and the fact that there’s no geography that should be admitted as science and that women are all hysterics and ought to be bled. %$* 369
uh, so, uh, that, um, assurance that the scientific community believes something does not take me very far. %$* 369
my question is address particularly to brenda, as well as to anyone else. %$* 369
um, i was fascinated by your statement that the earth is more fragile than human beings are. %$* 369
uh, i am not a scientist so maybe you can explain to me how we managed to get through the ice age and the middle ages when greenland was actually green and people were a foot taller and there was farming there, uh, and nobody was digging up coal to warm the earth. %$* 369
um, and, i’m curious as to why you think that this is an optimal period of climate, uh, certainly for far less money we could move everybody out of battery park city. %$* 369
and i am curious, if you believe that co2 is actually the, the—the particular problem is actually the issue, the degree to which you are willing to, to become like france, where instead of having 20% of their power from nuclear, they have 86%. %$* 369
when there was a natural ice age before and when we were coming out of that ice age there weren’t millions of people, 80% of our population living on the coasts with their high-dollar homes or, maybe fragile homes, not such high-dollar homes. %$* 366
there are many people living in bangladesh that are squeezed between sea- level rise and the melting of the, the himalayas and flooding from the land side. %$* 366
and so, we are talking about the fragility of humans adapting to this rapid change, as well as, when— in the past, sea-level rise, you could have, for example, wetlands marching up onto land, and moving inland and adapting and dunes moving inland, right now we have all our infrastructure in its place, and you can see, miami is stranded out there, atlantic city is stranded out there, we spend many of— millions of dollars dredging, and, and keeping these unsustainable systems that are not able to adapt naturally anymore because we’re in the way. %$* 366
and we also are gonna suffer, if we don’t, uh, make action. %$* 366
philip stott, you get 20 seconds to respond— %$* 79
yeah, it was a, i think a brilliant question that, because the earth is as tough as an old boot. %$* 103
if there is any fragility it’s in us and that’s what we’re concerned about, the earth will survive whether we’re here or not or whether there’s global warming or not— %$* 103
question on this side? %$* 79
hi, van greenfield, just following up a little bit on the, uh %$* 23
question two minutes ago on what we could do, um %$* 23
philip, you had said in another article, “my own instinct is that our ability to change reflectivity on the earth’s surface will in the end prove to have been far more important.” in terms of the concept of reflectivity could you expand on that and its possible %$* 23
less expensive method for dealing with this? %$* 23
very briefly, please. %$* 79
very briefly, but it’s a very important point, the point is very simple, that humans are not just doing co2, we do many factors, and the way we have altered the albedo as we call it, the surface reflectivity of the earth, uh, particularly i may add since the neolithic revolution in agriculture has had probably quite a significant effect. %$* 103
however, we can’t model it very well. %$* 103
and the problem is it’s one of those big gaps like many others things in the models that we’re talking—and that is a human factor. %$* 103
so in other words i agree with that, exactly how we cope with it though is another issue, because we know so little about it. %$* 103
and can i remind everybody that ipcc that we keep talking about, very honestly admits that we know very little about 80% of the factors behind climate change. %$* 103
one more thing for the anti side %$* 79
bef—oh, you wanna—okay, go ahead and give a quick response to that, 20-second response? %$* 79
go— %$* 79
uh, what is 80%— %$* 365
gavin, gavin schmidt— %$* 79
—of the counter-factors even mean. %$* 365
if you look at, if you look at the radiative forcing from carbon dioxide, from methane, from nitrous oxide, from cfc’s, from tropospheric ozone, from stratospheric ozone, from land-use change, from aerosols, from black soo—from black soot’s pa—um, impacts on, um, snow albedo, you know %$* 365
all of those, all of those things, we know some of them very well, we know some of them less well. %$* 365
but to, to, to claim that we don’t know anything about 80% of them, is, it’s, it’s a meaningless statistic— %$* 365
yeah, i’d like to—could i chime in there just for a moment, brian— %$* 363
richard somerville, also 20 seconds— %$* 79
listen, it’s, it’s fun to hear other people practicing meteorology without a license, so, and you know— this, this field is like all fields of science, you know, medical science is incomplete and has uncertainties too. %$* 363
but it’s good enough to be useful. %$* 363
you don’t dismiss your doctor’s advice, because she hasn’t solved all the diseases. %$* 363
and i think the same is true of climate science today. %$* 363
philip stott— %$* 79
don’t dismiss it— %$* 103
—one—one retort. %$* 79
well let’s use an engineer, i don’t think i’d want to cross brooklyn bridge if it were built by an engineer who only understood 80% of the forces on that bridge. %$* 103
there’s one thing %$* 79
i—i actually— %$* 365
that— %$* 79
—i, we, we %$* 365
i think we might have a solution to the energy crisis, we just need to tap philip stott. %$* 365
there is one thing that i think we need to get to before we wrap up. %$* 79
for the anti side %$* 79
they say %$* 79
the real crises today include poverty, dirty water, and a lack of modern energy supply to 4 billion poor people on earth. %$* 79
so if this is a crisis, how do you prioritize it, compared to those other things, and assuming that it takes tremendous amounts of resources to solve any of them. %$* 79
you know, i—i cannot imagine why philip stott and michael crichton seem to think that doing something about these terrible crises is impossible if you do something about climate change, or even made more difficult, climate change need not be in competition with or be an alternative to doing something about the terrible toll that poverty and preventable disease take. %$* 363
we can do both of those and many other worthy things as well, in fact, it’s exactly the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet who will suffer the most from the consequences of, of global warming which goes on unabated. %$* 363
michael crichton? %$* 79
you know, uh, i’m really fascinated at the number of newspaper headlines and articles that i see about global poverty and the, and the difficulties of people in africa as compared to the headlines about, about global warming, and, um, uh, of course richard it’s very true that we can do two things at the same time, it—the, the reality is that we don’t. %$* 364
and the reality is, that, we are failing and have continuously failed to address the issues of the third world even though, everyone knows that if you were to, to look at it for bangs for the buck, if you were to look at it from a humanitarian standpoint, if you were to look at it from the easiest way to do the most for environmental degradation as it’s created around the world, you would address global poverty. %$* 364
but we’re not. %$* 364
we’re talking as we’re talking tonight, we’re all getting very heated about something that may or may not happen 100 years from now. %$* 364
and while we’re doing, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 people are dead. %$* 364
that concludes %$* 79
the discussion portion of our program. %$* 79
and it is now time to vote. %$* 79
if you wanna vote for the motion, tear off “for” from the top %$* 79
of the motion, uh, ballot, and slip into the ballot boxes %$* 79
this is a ballot box, that will be passed among you. %$* 79
if you are against the motion, tear off and deposit “against” into the ballot box, and if you still don’t know where you stand %$* 79
put your entire ticket into the box. %$* 79
the ballot boxes will be given to the person at one end of a row, please pass the ballot box to your neighbor until it reaches the end of the row, pass it down just like in third grade. %$* 79
one of the ushers will then take the box to the next row, everyone will get a chance to vote so please don’t reach over your neighbor, wait for a ballot box to be passed to you. %$* 79
if you need a voting ticket, the ushers will give you one, just ask. %$* 79
no voter fraud, please. %$* 79
okay. %$* 79
now, here’s the deal. %$* 79
while you’re voting, we will have the closing remarks, two minutes, from each presenter, so we ask for your silence while they finish up, and then of course we will read the results of your voting. %$* 79
so now the final remarks from the panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion, panelists, please stay in your seats this time around, we begin with richard somerville. %$* 79
you know, the, the fossil fuel age will surely end, sooner rather than later i hope if we’re wise. %$* 363
sheikh yamani, the saudi oil minister was fond of saying “the stone age did not end because we ran out of stones.” and continuing to generate 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuel and using the atmosphere as a free dump for waste products, will ultimately produce a damaged planet. %$* 363
we’ve heard a lot of chatter about decarbonization this evening, the fact is that carbon dioxide emissions in the us and globally are going up, not down. %$* 363
sherwood rowland, later a nobel laureate, was a frustrated person in 1984, because humanity was so slow in dealing with the issue of ozone depletion. %$* 363
he said, quote, “after all, what’s the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions, if in the end, all we’re willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true.” roland’s remark is apt for our topic tonight. %$* 363
as in the case of ozone loss, so with global warming, once again, powerful technology, in this case abundant cheap fossil— %$* 363
one— %$* 79
—fuel energy, with unanticipated side effects, has brought us a faustian bargain. %$* 363
once again, the world finds itself at a point where difficult decisions must be made. %$* 363
that’s the definition of a crisis. %$* 363
nothing to do with alarmism or catastrophe. %$* 363
once again doing nothing or too little will lead to dire consequences. %$* 363
belittling the science, attacking the scientists, impugning their integrity and, and competence and motivations, refusing to recognize what we have learned about climate change in the vain and naïve hope that the problem will somehow solve itself is irresponsible. %$* 363
action is needed, meaningful action, soon. %$* 363
global warming is a crisis. %$* 363
thank you. %$* 363
i hope you voted against. %$* 363
you know, the, the fossil fuel age will surely end, sooner rather than later i hope if we’re wise. %$* 363
sheikh yamani, the saudi oil minister was fond of saying “the stone age did not end because we ran out of stones.” and continuing to generate 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuel and using the atmosphere as a free dump for waste products, will ultimately produce a damaged planet. %$* 363

philip stott, your closing statement. %$* 79
may i say that the last thing i want to do is to demean any scientist. %$* 103
the whole point about science is that it is a constant debate. %$* 103
and actually, what has worried me deeply about this is not the demeaning of scientists but the attempt to close down the debate, and actually take it away from science. %$* 103
if i may use a musical analogy, my other great interest, trying to reconstruct the climates of the moment as we’re talking about is a bit like trying to play mozart’s wonderful symphonia concertante 364, when you’ve no viola part and only a quarter of the violin part. %$* 103
in other words we know remarkably little about so much of the climate that, that we are facing. %$* 103
and, what i would like to stress is, it—it’s a debate on the crisis. %$* 103
we’ve mentioned the crisis of poverty, and i think the crisis of hypocrisy. %$* 103
actually where i think we probably agree entirely as a panel, what there really is in the world, there’s not a crisis of climate, a crisis of energy. %$* 103
that is certainly true in my country. %$* 103
and i’ll tell you what worries me particularly about attaching it to climate. %$* 103
one. %$* 79
in the world, there are groups, including some very reputable groups in denmark and in russia and in other countries, which are predicting actually that we will enter a global cooling phase between 2012 and 2015.now, i no more necessarily believe that than i do about the global warming. %$* 103
but just supposing that happens, and just supposing what the public reaction is to the hype that there has been about global warming, i actually think that we have to face up to a genuine energy issue in the world, and that most of our politicians are not doing that, in fact they’re dressing it up in this idea of global warming and saving the world, and what we desperately need are very practical decisions about energy, on the ground. %$* 103
and i think the idea of using the climate to do this is potentially a very dangerous one. %$* 103
so, what i am worried about is that everybody is now using the global con— global warming construction for their own agendas. %$* 103
from capitalist carbon trading, right the way to making you wear hemp underpants. %$* 103
i distrust that because in the end— %$* 103
may i say that the last thing i want to do is to demean any scientist. %$* 103
the whole point about science is that it is a constant debate. %$* 103
and actually, what has worried me deeply about this is not the demeaning of scientists but the attempt to close down the debate, and actually take it away from science. %$* 103
if i may use a musical analogy, my other great interest, trying to reconstruct the climates of the moment as we’re talking about is a bit like trying to play mozart’s wonderful symphonia concertante 364, when you’ve no viola part and only a quarter of the violin part. %$* 103

actually where i think we probably agree entirely as a panel, what there really is in the world, there’s not a crisis of climate, a crisis of energy. %$* 103
that is certainly true in my country. %$* 103
and i’ll tell you what worries me particularly about attaching it to climate. %$* 103
philip stott— %$* 79
—it’s an ism— %$* 103
—thank you very much— %$* 79
—and i distrust isms. %$* 103
gavin schmidt, your closing statement. %$* 79
hemp underpants, ugh. %$* 365
climate change is not a new issue. %$* 365
even human-cause climate change is not new. %$* 365
richard lindzen was arguing these same points 15 years ago, michael crichton is recycling talking points that are decades old. %$* 365
philip stott is grasping at extremely flimsy straws. %$* 365
serious scientists in the 1960s made predictions for what would be found if human emissions of greenhouse gases were to continue. %$* 365
they said the planet would warm. %$* 365
it has. %$* 365
they said the water vapor measurements would show rises. %$* 365
they do. %$* 365
they said that hos— ocean heat content would rise. %$* 365
it has. %$* 365
they said the stratosphere would cool. %$* 365
it did. %$* 365
if i had time i could go on listing the number of challenges this basic idea has faced and come through. %$* 365
but you only need to know that it is still standing, and that there are no coherent theories that fit the observations better. %$* 365
given that understanding, and the ever-increasing emissions that we are putting into the air, to deny this is a crisis on a planetary scale is truly to fiddle while home burns. %$* 365
one. %$* 79
i’m done. %$* 365
that’s it? %$* 79
richard lindzen, your closing statement. %$* 79
yes. %$* 362
i think it’s a little bit difficult to know how to respond, to be told that, uh, one shouldn’t attack scientists while you’re attacking scientists, to go and say you have to control methane without explaining that methane has stopped growing. %$* 362
you don’t explain why there’s global warming on mars, jupiter, triton and pluto. %$* 362
you don’t look at the ocean data and see, that whereas your boss jim hansen was saying that the heating of the ocean proved the flux that he needed for high sensitivity, that in the last year there’ve been two papers in the same journal, that point out that the original levitus data’s wrong, that the ocean is cool, and that the new numbers would call for one-tenth the sensitivity that hansen mentioned. %$* 362
if all this is so certain, why is the data changing, or is it a case when the data changes you ignore it, and— %$* 362
one— %$* 79
—stick to the point. %$* 362
you have a minute, do you want the other minute? %$* 79
you have a minute—no? %$* 79
uh, okay. %$* 79
brenda ekwurzel, your closing statement. %$* 79
global warming is here today and is accelerating. %$* 366
many business leaders are already realizing that it makes economic sense to start fighting global warming. %$* 366
wal-mart, dupont, bp, general electric, they all are asking for action. %$* 366
and, businesses need a clear signal from the national level. %$* 366
because they want to have a level playing field, and, they want to plan for the future. %$* 366
and that’s what makes good business sense. %$* 366
we need a national policy because people, cities and states cannot reduce global warming enough to make a significant dent in this issue. %$* 366
ultimately the atmosphere is gonna register all of our choices from today onward. %$* 366
we must act now because if we leave it to our children, the risk will be too great and it will be too late. %$* 366
fortunately there already exist solutions, all we—we need now is the will to implement them rapidly. %$* 366
thank you. %$* 366
michael crichton, your closing statement. %$* 79
there was a time when i worked in a clinic and, uh, one day a young woman came in, she was in her early twenties for a routine checkup and, i said what’s going on with you and she said i’ve just become blind. %$* 364
and, i said, oh my gosh, really, when did it happen, she said, well just, uh, coming into the clinic, walking up the steps of the clinic i became blind. %$* 364
and i said, oh, and i’m—by now i’m looking through the chart and i said, well, has this happened before, she said yes, it’s happened before. %$* 364
i’ve become blind in the past, and, what she had of course was hysterical blindness. %$* 364
and the characteristic of that, is that, the severity of the symptom is not matched by the emotional response that’s, that’s being presented. %$* 364
most people would be screaming about that but she was very calm, oh yes, i’m blind again. %$* 364
and i’m reminded of that whenever i hear, that we’re facing, whether we wanna call it a crisis or not, a significant global event, of, of, of importance where we’re gonna have species lost and so on and so forth— %$* 364
one— %$* 79
—that we can really address this by changing our light bulbs. %$* 364
or that we can really make an impact by unplugging our appliances when we’re not using them. %$* 364
it’s very much out of whack. %$* 364
and so if %$* 364
if it were only gonna do symbolic actions, i would like to suggest a few symbolic actions that right—might really mean something. %$* 364
one of them, which is very simple, 99% of the american population doesn’t care, is ban private jets. %$* 364
nobody needs to fly in them, ban them now. %$* 364
and, and in addition, let’s have the nrdc, the, the sierra club and greenpeace make it a rule that all of their, all of their members, cannot fly on private jets, they must get their houses off the grid, they must live in the way that they’re telling everyone else to live. %$* 364
and if they won’t do that, why should we. %$* 364
and why should we take them seriously. %$* 364
there was a time when i worked in a clinic and, uh, one day a young woman came in, she was in her early twenties for a routine checkup and, i said what’s going on with you and she said i’ve just become blind. %$* 364
and, i said, oh my gosh, really, when did it happen, she said, well just, uh, coming into the clinic, walking up the steps of the clinic i became blind. %$* 364
and i said, oh, and i’m—by now i’m looking through the chart and i said, well, has this happened before, she said yes, it’s happened before. %$* 364
i’ve become blind in the past, and, what she had of course was hysterical blindness. %$* 364
and the characteristic of that, is that, the severity of the symptom is not matched by the emotional response that’s, that’s being presented. %$* 364
most people would be screaming about that but she was very calm, oh yes, i’m blind again. %$* 364
and i’m reminded of that whenever i hear, that we’re facing, whether we wanna call it a crisis or not, a significant global event, of, of, of importance where we’re gonna have species lost and so on and so forth— %$* 364
i wanna thank the debaters %$* 79
and the audience for all your good work. %$* 79
before i announce the results of the audience vote i wanna take care of a few little things. %$* 79
first, the next intelligence squared us debate will take place on wednesday, april 18th, here at the asia society and museum. %$* 79
the motion to be debated is, “better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.” the remaining two debates in this spring series including that one are all sold out. %$* 79
the good news is that packages are available on-line and by phone for the fall 2007-spring 2008 series. %$* 79
priority will be given to full-season subscribers, so avoid disappointment and buy those series packages now. %$* 79
tonight’s debate can be heard locally on wnyc am 820, on friday, march 23rd at 2 p.m. %$* 79
you can also purchase dvd’s from previous debates upstairs in the lobby or on the intelligence squared us website. %$* 79
finally, please be sure to pick up a copy of the times literary supplement—are those actually available, there was some question about that. %$* 79
is that a—yes, yes, they are available, uh, as you leave the auditorium, and in a minute you can all go home and watch the “american idol” results show. %$* 79
and now the results of our debate. %$* 79
after our debaters did their best to sway you %$* 79
you went from, 30% for the motion that global warming is not a crisis, from 30% to 46%. against the motion, went from 57% to 42% %$* 79
and “undecided” went from 13% to 12%.the hardcore ambivalent are still among us. %$* 79
so, in terms of opinion change, those in favor of the motion, have carried the day, congratulations to the team for the motion. %$* 79
and thank you all again very much, good night. %$* 79

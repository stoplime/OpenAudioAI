and your silence speaks for the rest of your thought. %$* 13
i'll take it back to gene healy. %$* 13
yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as deborah's pointed out. %$* 609
i'd also say that, as she pointed out, the isis strategy is to focus on the near enemy. %$* 609
al-qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy. %$* 609
the fact that isis has local apocalyptic and monstrous goals may explain-- %$* 609
and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two heads of the national counterterrorism center, has said that there is no evidence that isis has plans or major capability to attack the homeland. %$* 609
i'll take that to akhil amar. %$* 13
so remember that the authorization of the use of military force that i tried to read slowly and carefully to you addresses not just the original organizations, but any other organizations or persons that aided them or that harbored them, and their successors. %$* 612
so, it's about, i think to paraphrase my partner, a broad network of affiliate organizations. %$* 612
i should've also probably said it's the same basic theater of war and the same geographic target, namely new york-- %$* 612
okay, respond to gene's point, though, that this particular group, isil, is not necessarily-- %$* 13
actually, stronger than that, that it appears not to be a direct threat to the united states. %$* 13
is that relevant? %$* 13
well, the president of the-- %$* 612
that might go to the wisdom of, and proportionality of what sort of force is to be used, but he invoked a lot of people that i don’t actually see in this authorization the use of military force. %$* 612
what i see talks about the president, not the joint chiefs of staff or anyone else. %$* 612
in our system we elect a president, and actually we elect him because we think he has good judgment. %$* 612
he tells us basically what his fundamental approach is, and actually we re-elected him-- %$* 612
and that was true of mr. %$* 612
lincoln and that's true of mr. %$* 612
obama-- %$* 612
and he's the one who determines that he has to have some evidence for it in good faith and i've seen no evidence of that %$* 612
there might be some limits to that proposition, right? %$* 610
the president determines, he alone. %$* 610
so if the president determines alone in a fit of pique that china is in fact now al-qaeda, right, does the authorization for the use of military force to authorize the president to go after those who attacked us on 9/11 authorize the president to use force against anyone? %$* 610
how many people who are in charge of china have any-- %$* 612
are the same people who are in al- qaeda? %$* 612
and the answer is zero, okay? %$* 612
there are a gazillion organizations in the world and nation states, and they do not have any overlap whatsoever with the original al-qaeda. %$* 612
we detained people in guantanamo who were from china. %$* 610
we let them go actually not all that long ago, right? %$* 610
so the notion that there are some of the same people in some of these same places i think is insufficient to establish what the administration says, which is not that isil is an associated group of al-qaeda or an off-shoot, but that isil is al-qaeda, right? %$* 610
the administration can't say they're an associated force. %$* 610
isil and al-qaeda are shooting at each other. %$* 610
i'm glad you mentioned-- %$* 611
phillip bobbitt. %$* 13
guantanamo. %$* 611
what do you do with the fact that all the guantanamo cases that have considered this, every single federal court that's considered this question, has held that the islamic state is in fact an associated force with al-qaeda? %$* 611
what do you do with that? %$* 611
what do you do with the fact that-- %$* 611
which court has held that-- %$* 610
congress-- %$* 611
what do you do with the fact that congress has authorized funds for air attacks on the islamic state? %$* 611
you say, what do we do if barak obama decided to attack brooklyn, or what would we do if they decide to attack norway, what would we do-- %$* 611
well, one thing you would do is that congress would say this is not appropriate, as the statute requires, but the congress has spoken about this. %$* 611
what do you guys say about the authorization of our air attacks on the islamic state? %$* 611
that's %$* 611
deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
if i took everything that congress does as proof of its constitutionality, i would have to challenge, right, marbury versus madison. %$* 610
just because congress has passed a law doesn't mean the law congress has passed is constitutional. %$* 610
so you think the authorization for funds for air attacks on the islamic state is unconstitutional? %$* 611
i think-- %$* 610
fine. %$* 611
why? %$* 611
i don't think-- %$* 610
congress's authorization-- %$* 610
does it violate the text-- %$* 18
for the use of funds is constitutional, but i don't think we can take their authorization for the use of funds as a commentary on whether or not they think the president has the power to wage war without congressional authorization. %$* 610
can we take a-- %$* 13
can we take a little bit-- %$* 13
congressional authorization. %$* 612
see, there's authorization of the use of military force, and then there's a second congressional authorization with the house and the senate and the president once they actually know who's being bombed. %$* 612
can we take a step back from these specifics for just a bit and then return to them? %$* 13
but i just want to go a little bit to the constitutional-- %$* 13
to the textual issues, and just ask each of you, by looking at the language of the constitution what does-- %$* 13
what power does it give congress over-- %$* 13
what check does it give over the president in your opinion, in the broad, in broad principle? %$* 13
and i'll go to this side first. %$* 13
either one of you wants to take it, gene healy, or deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
well, as deborah said, the bulk of the war powers are with congress. %$* 609
the declare war clause, which madison identified as the part of the constitution, where the most wisdom was to be found, is an independent check on-- %$* 609
or it was intended to be an independent check on presidential ability to initiate war. %$* 609
all the-- %$* 609
you know, most of the framers who spoke about this power, james wilson, the architect of the presidency, said, "this system will not hurry us into war. %$* 609
it is calculated to guard against it."and he identified the declare war clause as the clause he was talking about. %$* 609
george washington wasn't sure he had the power to launch offensive operations against indians without an authorization from congress. %$* 609
so this was an important check. %$* 609
moreover, where does the president get the power? %$* 609
the president doesn't get the power from the commander in chief clause, and alexander hamilton said that was-- %$* 609
that meant nothing more than that he was the first general and admiral of the united states, and generals and admirals don't get to decide whether and with whom we go to war. %$* 609
all right, let me take that to the other side. %$* 13
do you agree with that assessment of %$* 13
i'm surprised. %$* 611
philip bobbitt. %$* 13
i thought-- %$* 611
and i must say, i was very impressed by this-- %$* 611
i thought our opponents were not going to say that we required a declaration of war. %$* 611
i thought their point was that we required congressional authorization. %$* 611
it could be by a declaration of war, it could be by a joint resolution, it could be by a statute, but we had to have congressional authorization. %$* 611
now mr. %$* 611
healy begins to suggest that perhaps that isn't enough, that you also need a declaration of war. %$* 611
now, if we want to talk about that-- %$* 611
well, i didn't ask-- %$* 13
wait, wait, wait-- %$* 13
in fairness to gene, i did not ask him whether there needed to be a declaration of war in this instance. %$* 13
i was asking him in the broad principle where the power line goes. %$* 13
you don't need the magic words, you didn't-- %$* 609
it was recognized from the first generation that you did not need formal authorization. %$* 609
you need some kind of substantive authorization that perhaps is renewed more than once a generation. %$* 609
how about a statute whose title is, "the authorization of the use of military force," that-- %$* 612
explicitly has no sunset and says that it applies-- %$* 612
it's adopted in order to, quote, "prevent any future attack of a 9/11-- %$* 612
you've mentioned that clause several times, and the actual history of that-- %$* 609
yeah. %$* 612
no, the actual history of that clause was the bush administration's original draft of the aumf gave the president the power to deter and-- %$* 609
an independent power to deter and preempt all future acts of terrorism against the united states. %$* 609
that was so horrifying to a congress, even in the aftershock of 9/11, that they changed that language to dis-link that as an independent power. %$* 609
to apply-- %$* 612
he has the power to go after persons or organizations linked to 9/11 for the purpose of-- %$* 609
linked to al-qaeda, linked to the folks who did it in 9/11, and that's our claim, these guys are linked to them. %$* 612
i think it's an important distinction-- %$* 611
well, they're shooting at each other. %$* 609
the language isn't linked to 9/11. the language is linked to the perpetrators of 9/11. %$* 611
aiding or harboring them, ex-ante or ex-post-- %$* 612
the language isn't linked. %$* 610
the language is “responsible for the attacks of 9/11.”and i want to come back to the question that was posed here a minute ago, which is "why is it that we should have”-- %$* 610
and we all agree, right, some congressional authorization is required-- %$* 610
the notion is, "well, you don't have to say specifically who the enemy is, right? %$* 610
the enemy can be al-qaeda, the taliban, associated forces, people responsible for the attacks of 9/11, or whoever, right? %$* 610
the reason why you need congressional authorization and the reason why you have to name who the enemy is, is the same. %$* 610
it is in order for congress to have a meaningful check in a democracy. %$* 610
you can't lead a people into war without telling them who they're going to war against and why. %$* 610
so-- %$* 610
so, this is-- %$* 612
that's why naming the enemy is as important-- %$* 610
this is-- %$* 612
as the authorization in the first place. %$* 610
this is the second time that you've actually suggested-- %$* 612
at least the second time-- %$* 612
that the real constitutional culprit here is not the president, but that congress has somehow passed an unconstitutional statute, which is a very odd proposition to me. %$* 612
i don't think i was suggesting congress passed a-- %$* 610
so, congress passed a statute that didn't read the way you would have drafted it, mentioning al-qaeda by name, and for very good reasons, because we wouldn't want to let them change their-- %$* 612
you know, just call themselves "shal-qaeda" or, you know-- %$* 612
they actually-- %$* 612
you're saying, "well, unless you actually name the organization, it's not valid." and we're saying, where did you get that from? %$* 612
i'm saying the statute is entirely constitutional. %$* 610
and all three branches of government have concluded that the statute authorized the use of force against three groups-- %$* 610
al-qaeda, the taliban, and associated forces. %$* 610
isil is not the taliban. %$* 610
the administration says they're not associated forces, because after all, they're fighting with each other. %$* 610
the administration says they're al-qaeda, and i'm telling you, there's no sense in which they're al-qaeda. %$* 610
and i'm not the only one who says that, because i'm after all, not that persuasive, right? %$* 610
you've got to read the west point counterterrorism center report. %$* 610
you've got to read, actually, a wonderful piece in the atlantic about who isil is. %$* 610
and no matter what the president says, at some level, there's got to be a recognition of who we're talking about. %$* 610
and this isn't it. %$* 610
philip bobbitt. %$* 13
well, this is what puzzles me. %$* 611
you say we have to read a west point manual, but you're not prepared to take what every federal court that has considered this matter has said: that the islamic state is an associated force. %$* 611
you say, "we want to reassess this and decide how the phrases ought to have been used." but you're not prepared to answer what you do with a congressional appropriation. %$* 611
i haven't-- %$* 610
this is a-- %$* 611
that it-- %$* 610
if i may just say one more thing. %$* 611
what federal court is it that has-- %$* 610
in the guantanamo-- %$* 611
opined on isis? %$* 610
in the guantanamo cases. %$* 611
these are guantanamo prisoner cases. %$* 611
habeas-- %$* 611
they didn't talk about isil at all. %$* 610
it didn't exist then. %$* 610
let me move onto another question, to the side that's arguing for the motion that the president has exceeded. %$* 13
your opponents have-- %$* 13
on the one hand, while arguing that isil is the same as the-- %$* 13
essentially, the same as the group that was specified in the 2001 authorization, they're-- %$* 13
they also argue that the state of-- %$* 13
in the state of the world today, war is a very changing thing, that it would be-- %$* 13
as philip bobbitt said-- %$* 13
absurd to have to issue a new resolution every time a new entrant showed up on the field, a new combatant showed up on the field. %$* 13
some permutation of-- %$* 13
and that you just can't-- %$* 13
you can't operate that way, which is a very compelling argument. %$* 13
i want to see what your response is to that, gene healy. %$* 13
i think the president has residual powers under article ii to deal with-- %$* 609
you know, deborah mentioned the phrase, "repelling sudden attacks," which comes up at the constitutional convention. %$* 609
and i think you can be flexible with that. %$* 609
i don't think you have to be wedded to an 18th century understanding, or one that doesn't comport with modern warfare. %$* 609
but you do have to-- %$* 609
for the president to legitimately use this reserved article ii power, it has to actually be a threat to the country. %$* 609
and it-- %$* 609
was libya-- %$* 13
was libya a threat? %$* 13
not in the remotest sense. %$* 609
let me take that to the other side. %$* 13
libya. %$* 13
your response. %$* 13
akhil amar. %$* 13
i'll say something about libya in one second, but-- %$* 612
again, just remembering the statute, the statute is about not just repelling attack, but preventing future attack, okay? %$* 612
now, if we-- %$* 612
if they've conceded on isil and isis-- %$* 612
i'm happy about that. %$* 612
if that's now put off the table, and now we're just talking about libya, i'm happy to address libya. %$* 612
and-- %$* 612
for the record, they have not conceded. %$* 13
okay. %$* 612
well-- %$* 612
i believe you say you won the point, but they have not conceded. %$* 13
now, on libya-- %$* 612
just like a simple point. %$* 612
you know, how many body bags were there in libya? %$* 612
and apart from one embassy attack, this does not seem to me like full-blown war. %$* 612
ah. %$* 13
and there's language in the war powers resolution-- %$* 612
and if you want to read my piece on this, i wrote a piece in slate on this that i think actually authorized the use of force in that situation. %$* 612
and you could read the testimony. %$* 612
but we know what war looks like. %$* 612
vietnam was a war. %$* 612
and there were body-bags. %$* 612
50,000 of them. %$* 612
we know what wars look like. %$* 612
korea. %$* 612
there were no body bags in the libyan intervention, and in that sense, it's much more like all sorts of things that ronald reagan did in grenada, all sorts of uses of force that really don't rise to the level of full-blown war. %$* 612
okay. %$* 13
i want to go to audience questions in a moment. %$* 13
i want to remind you again, if you raise your hand someone will-- %$* 13
i'll call on you. %$* 13
if you could stand up. %$* 13
someone will come to you with a microphone. %$* 13
hold it about as far away from your mouth as this is so that we can all hear you. %$* 13
tell us your name and ask your question. %$* 13
again, it needs to be tight and a question, but most importantly needs to be on this topic of the constitutional divide. %$* 13
and while you're getting ready to do that, i just want to take-- %$* 13
to decide arguing for the motion what your opponent was just saying in terms of libya wasn't a war, and i think we need maybe to spend one minute or so on talking about language here, what we mean by a war. %$* 13
does it matter how we define war in this conversation? %$* 13
well, you just said-- %$* 609
gene healy. %$* 13
professor amar was doing a lot better than secretary of defense gates in that he was able to make that argument with a straight face. %$* 609
when gates, once in congress and once on 60 minutes, tried to sell the idea that launching thousands of tomahawk missiles at another sovereign country wasn't war, he had to smirk. %$* 609
that was the line he was given to sell and he did not sell it. %$* 609
did he smirk? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 609
what did that look like? %$* 13
well, you know, it's hard to discern, but a quarter of his mouth turned up. %$* 609
so it was a clear smirk? %$* 13
phil bobbitt. %$* 13
phil bobbitt. %$* 13
i just want to point out there was u.n.security council resolution on libya. %$* 611
it's not-- %$* 611
it wasn't done pursuant to congressional authorization. %$* 611
it was done pursuant to a treaty. %$* 611
we can constitutionally wage war by at least four roots, repelling a sudden attack as our opponents have noted, relying on the article ii power of the president, by a statute or joint resolution adopted by both houses of congress, by a treaty, as in korea or as in libya, and by a declaration of war. %$* 611
let's go to some questions. %$* 13
any hands up? %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
so, a mic is going to come down the aisle to you. %$* 13
if you could just hang on. %$* 13
what is the substantive difference between a declaration of war and an aumf, and is there a different constitutional threshold for a president's ability to drop a bomb given one or the other? %$* 18
that's-- %$* 13
that doesn't actually have them debating, but i like that question because it might get them debating on this topic, because they might disagree about the difference on that. %$* 13
i'll take it to deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
i think maybe we might agree. %$* 610
i think for present purposes especially there's no constitutional difference between declaring war against isil and authorizing the use of force against isil. %$* 610
in either event, depending on the terms of the authorization for the use of force, congress could of course impose a limitation, right? %$* 610
the president can't use ground troops, for example, but assuming the authorization for the use of force in the statute didn't authorize anything different, i think they have the same effect in this case. %$* 610
is there disagreement on that side? %$* 13
phil. %$* 13
there's a bit of a difference, as i'm sure my partners here would agree. %$* 611
a declaration of war perfects a war. %$* 611
what does that mean? %$* 13
it's the way you perfect a lien. %$* 611
it allows for additional authority, the authority to blockade enemy ports, to intern enemy civilians domestically. %$* 611
it's-- %$* 611
you move from a limited war to a total war in international law when you perfect the war by a declaration. %$* 611
that's why if you look back on our declared wars, they are something like total wars, and if you look at the wars that are done by authorizations and statutes and joint resolutions, they don't rise to that level. %$* 611
and as my opponents know, this is a supreme court case, 1800, bas v. %$* 611
tingy. %$* 611
deborah pearlstein, looking at your face maybe there is an argument there. %$* 13
actually-- %$* 610
right, so i don't quite agree with that. %$* 610
right, so and let's take practice and current practice as an example, right? %$* 610
we used an authorization for the use of military force, the 2001 authorization of which professor amar is so fond, right, to invade afghanistan and to detain an intern over the course of that war, and indeed the broader war with al-qaeda, tens of thousands of prisoners. %$* 610
and we repeatedly-- %$* 610
and congress embraced this, the president embraced this, the courts have embraced it-- %$* 610
repeatedly invoked the international law of war, international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, exactly those laws. %$* 610
so if we thought it required a declaration of war as such to do that, everything we've done more or less %$* 610
was that not a discretionary move as opposed to a move compelled by a declaration of war? %$* 13
to-- %$* 610
to trigger international conventions, et cetera. %$* 13
there was no obligation. %$* 13
i would think that their argument is there would be no obligation. %$* 13
so, the united states has an obligation under its treaty commitments, which after the supreme law of the land, and to observe that law of war in any armed conflict, and it would say it applied here. %$* 610
okay. %$* 13
let's go to another question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
again, the mic will find you. %$* 13
from behind you this one's coming, if you turn around. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 18
sure. %$* 13
this is for the group that was against the declaration. %$* 18
what level of separation would you see from an affiliate of al-qaeda and the perpetrators of 9/11 would you need a new authorization of military force? %$* 18
would it be those who were affiliated directly with 9/11 or would it be-- %$* 18
how far would you-- %$* 18
how different do these guys have to be from al-qaeda before you would think that, in fact, a new resolution was justified? %$* 13
i suppose if there were no evidence on which the president could make a determination, and that an attack on that party or that group would or could reasonably be thought to deter future attacks on us, if the action taken were so inappropriate or so bizarre, so farfetched, if the group itself had-- %$* 611
did not have-- %$* 611
has never had-- %$* 611
did not share the objectives, the weapon sources and funding with the persons and groups that aided the perpetrators, financed them and planned the attacks on 9/11, yes, i think that would go beyond the statute. %$* 611
i'll just emphasize this one point. %$* 611
when we start talking about all the crazy things the president might do, all the odd groups he might suddenly decide to make war on, we have not silenced the congress. %$* 611
we haven't stopped our political process. %$* 611
when the president really does decide that, i don't know, the new york yankees or norway or something is the next associated group, we have ways of stopping him. %$* 611
and the way we do it is not by both houses of congress approving air attacks. %$* 611
gene healy, can you respond to the first part of philip bobbitt's answer in which he spelled out a scenario in which he would think that a group that wants to do us in would require a new resolution because it would be different enough? %$* 13
well, the administration has changed its own criteria for what it includes in associated forces, a term that doesn't appear anywhere in the aumf.it used to require co-belligerency with al- qaeda. %$* 609
isis is not a cobelligerent with al-qaeda. %$* 609
it's an organization that is not only in competition with al-qaeda, but at times actively fighting al-qaeda affiliates. %$* 609
so, you know, i think at some point you have to read that organization out of the definition. %$* 609
and they were concerned about the legal basis for this and how open-ended it was two years before they shifted to expand their own definition to allow isis in. %$* 609
before the-- %$* 609
you mean the obama administration? %$* 13
yes-- %$* 609
yes. %$* 13
the obama administration attorneys were-- %$* 609
there was a-- %$* 609
you know, from what you-- %$* 609
from what you can tell from public accounts of it, a pretty fiery debate over whether they had the authority, even before isis came on the scene, to stretch the law as far as they'd already stretched it. %$* 609
okay, let's go to another question. %$* 13
i wanted to say that if you're not sitting in the area that has direct light on you, it's difficult for me to see you, but you might want to move forward. %$* 13
but i'm going to scan again now. %$* 13
right down front here, and the mic's coming down on your right hand side. %$* 13
if the senate passes a new aumf that gives the president authority to fight isil or isis, does that make current actions in iraq and syria unconstitutional or does it give them added authority, like you said previously, with perfecting that lien? %$* 18
well, i suppose-- %$* 612
akhil amar. %$* 13
wouldn't be just the senate, of course. %$* 612
it would be a resolution subject to the constitutional principles of bicameralism and presentment. %$* 612
it would require the house and the senate and the-- %$* 612
that would be presented to the president for his signature, and it would all depend on how it was worded. %$* 612
and one of the things i believe that the administration was proposing is, "maybe let's swap out the existing aumf," which actually does not have a sunset, with one that would actually not merely supplement it, but supersede it, and supersede it in a way that actually was perhaps more limited, that did have a sunset provision, and other things. %$* 612
so it all depends on how it would be written. %$* 612
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." would either of you like to respond to the points that were just made or move on to another question? %$* 13
deborah pearlstein? %$* 13
no? %$* 13
no. %$* 610
okay. %$* 13
another question? %$* 13
sir, right down here. %$* 13
the mic is coming from your right side. %$* 13
so, professor bobbitt, you've alluded to the president's determination that isil is an affiliate or associate of al-qaeda. %$* 18
is there a standard of review here for the president? %$* 18
yes, i think there is. %$* 611
i think that congress is the standard. %$* 611
let me make this absolutely clear. %$* 611
there are many persons who believe that the president's article ii powers, standing alone, would be sufficient for him to wage war against the islamic state: it has attacked us, it has attacked our aid workers, it has attacked our diplomats, it has attacked our troops, it has attacked our allies. %$* 611
that's not the position that professor amar and i are taking. %$* 611
there may be a lot to that, but that's not our view. %$* 611
we want the congress involved. %$* 611
we think congressional authorization is crucial. %$* 611
and the real review, as you say, isn't so much judicial review. %$* 611
it is congressional review. %$* 611
you've got to go back and get funds from congress to actually fund those air strikes. %$* 611
and that's what the president did and that's what the congress adopted. %$* 611
and we just can't get away from that. %$* 611
i don't think we can get-- %$* 611
sugar coat that or airbrush it out of this debate. %$* 611
we want congressional authorization. %$* 611
we want the congress to look at this. %$* 611
we want them to say the president has done the appropriate thing or he hasn't. %$* 611
but you think it has? %$* 13
you think that's already done? %$* 13
indeed i do. %$* 611
indeed i-- %$* 611
it's not just what i think. %$* 611
it's what the congress thinks. %$* 611
gene healy. %$* 13
there's a long history of congress's feeling compelled to continue wars and to provide funding for wars that the president has launched. %$* 609
in libya, as i recall, there was no specific-- %$* 609
separate appropriation for the libyan conflict. %$* 609
it came out of the overseas contingency fund. %$* 609
and what's more, the house actually voted down authorization. %$* 609
at some point, when you say the president can go and wage war wherever he wants and if congress funds it, that's fine, you've sort of turned the constitution on its head. %$* 609
you've put all the checks that are supposed to stand in the way of unilateral action, and then congress-- %$* 609
and then the president's action stands unless-- %$* 609
as you know, in the vietnam war, there's an actual effort to defund it. %$* 609
i think that puts-- %$* 609
that makes things exactly backwards. %$* 609
okay. %$* 13
indeed. %$* 610
it would render-- %$* 610
deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
the declare war clause and the associated clauses there, effectively moot. %$* 610
if all congress had to do to authorize war was appropriate funds, then why include a declare war power at all? %$* 610
what would the point of that ever be? %$* 610
and we just talked about how perfecting it, in the sense of international law, can't be it. %$* 610
in fact, the administration itself doesn't make the argument that the funds congress has appropriated for military action, part of which-- %$* 610
a large part of which at the beginning was in defense of our own assets in the region, to the extent that they were being attacked. %$* 610
the president himself says the conflict has gone much beyond that now. %$* 610
but the president himself doesn't rest on that. %$* 610
he says he rests on his article ii authority and then he asks congress for additional authorization, which is why the house and senate are debating the need for a new authorization now. %$* 610

and i think there's something extremely paternalistic and antidemocratic in the assumptions that both of my esteemed colleagues are making, that they're assuming that just because somebody spends a lot of money on ads that we the people are going to be duped and necessarily vote for that person? %$* 51
or if information gets out that somebody has received a lot of campaign contributions and is voting accordingly that we the people are going to support that politician? %$* 51
the record speaks to the contrary. %$* 51
look at eric cantor, exhibit a, very recently vastly outspent his unknown opponent, was supported by all of the big corporate interests and yet that money was drowned out by the local grassroots people. %$* 51
nadine, you're acting the pragmatics of what your opponents are saying, but they're also making the point that the text doesn't actually-- %$* 13
the text doesn't actually protect spending. %$* 13
but the text talks about "congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." the supreme court consistently and correctly has said that any measure that abridges, i.e., cuts back on speech, makes it more difficult and burdensome to engage in speech is an abridgment. %$* 51
if you are told that you cannot spend as much money as you would like to speak as much and effectively as you would like, that clearly is an abridgment. %$* 51
zephyr teachout, that's a coherent and logical argument. %$* 13
yeah, no, and i want to be just very precise about the way in which we imagine political reform working. %$* 206
it's not political reform mandated by the supreme court, but the public demanding a set of rules, congress enacting those rules, and then the court, i would say, should only then intervene in these democratically demanded rules when there is something truly disturbing, some violation of the first amendment which requires it, because the court itself-- %$* 206
but-- %$* 13
but are your opponents not saying that having the rule, period, is a violation of the first amendment? %$* 13
no, i was-- %$* 206
yes, but i was responding to your first argument that basically there-- %$* 206
what we want to do is empower congress to actually respond to the constantly changing game of the corrupted %$* 206
all right. %$* 13
but that doesn't go to the-- %$* 13
that doesn't go to the core of the argument they're making which is absolute on the first amendment. %$* 13
and i just want to hear your response to that. %$* 13
does the text not say, as nadine just spelled out, and i said coherently, that the-- %$* 13
that the congress may not pass any law abridging freedom of speech. %$* 13
is that not clearcut? %$* 13
it's not. %$* 205
i'll let burt neuborne take it. %$* 13
it's not clearcut. %$* 205
okay. %$* 13
she left out the three most important words. %$* 205
the first amendment doesn't say "congress shall not-- %$* 205
shall pass no law abridging speech." if that's what it said, they couldn't outlaw extortion, they couldn't outlaw bribery, they couldn't outlaw threats. %$* 205
it says "congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of speech." the freedom of speech is not a self-evident idea. %$* 205
you have to figure out what goes inside the freedom of speech and what goes outside the freedom of speech otherwise why are those three words there? %$* 205
floyd abrams. %$* 13
what you're missing is that the one area of speech which is most protected is political speech. %$* 204
there's nothing that we protect more than that. %$* 204
there's no area in which we give the congress less leeway to act for a variety of reasons, not least that the single most important purpose for adopting the first amendment was as a protection against the government, against the government influencing, affecting, limiting, chilling speech. %$* 204
that's why thomas jefferson, sitting in paris, said he wouldn't support the constitution at all unless there was a bill of rights which contained a clear, unambiguous-- %$* 204
what became the first amendment. %$* 204
no, but floyd, you're making two different arguments, and i want to separate them out, because one is a very important argument that i think we should pay attention to. %$* 206
when congress passes laws that increase their own power or entrench their own power, we should be very wary of them, and we should be wary of them because it's a basic democratic principle against corruption, not because it's a first free speech principle but because it's an anticorruption principle. %$* 206
and then there's a separate principle which is embodied in the first amendment totally distinct, which is the principle that we should be free from government censorship and government telling us what to think, whether or not we can say something about a particular invasion, what we think about a particular policy issue. %$* 206
and that is not threatened when-- %$* 206
do you agree-- %$* 13
that is not threatened when congress passes a law saying that a corporation cannot spend more than $60,000. %$* 206
do you concede you're opponent's point, burt or zephyr, that there is no political speech without money? %$* 13
sure. %$* 205
i concede-- %$* 205
there's no speech here, you can't have speech anywhere. %$* 205
it costs money to run a democracy. %$* 205
the question is since it costs money to run a democracy, are we going to essentially say that the people with the money get to control the democracy-- %$* 205
they – %$* 51
or are we going to try to pass laws that say, "look, we have to figure out how to fund this thing"? %$* 205
but the way we don't want to fund it is to let the top 1/10 of 1 percent of the population have a disproportionate say in what democracy is-- %$* 205
they don’t-- %$* 51
nadine strossen. %$* 13
have a disproportionate say, burt, in all of the recent elections, including the post citizens united elections, when everybody was forecasting that big money, especially corporate money, would drown out all voices-- %$* 51
even the new york times had to eat its own words and say, "these elections have been a landslide loss for big money." we, the people, are not such dupes. %$* 51
that's what democracy is about. %$* 51
nadine-- %$* 207
and i also-- %$* 51
no, we-- %$* 206
i really-- %$* 51
i also have to make this point because burt suggested that you have to choose between equality principles, which i hold as dear as first amendment principles and free speech, the opposite is true, when the aclu challenged the initial federal campaign finance law in buckley versus valeo in 1976, we argued that, that violated equal protection as much as it violated free speech because it is an incumbent protection act, as all of these laws are. %$* 51
okay, let's defer to i think misstated his position on that. %$* 13
burt neuborne. %$* 13
well, i mean, my position is that, of course, speech costs money. %$* 205
the question is, "where do we find it? %$* 205
" now, nadine says, "don't worry. %$* 205
money doesn't always win." well, look, i'm one of these poor souls that's rooted for the mets for many, many years." i live in new york city and i have to face yankee fans every day. %$* 205
guess what? %$* 205
the mets beat the yankees every once in a while but over time the team with the most money to buy the best players wins the series. %$* 205
well, why don't you get an owner who spends some money? %$* 204
well, that's true, but-- %$* 205
that's true in politics. %$* 205
the team with the most money wins, and the rich win in this country because they control the democracy. %$* 205
burt, that is the worst-- %$* 204
floyd abrams. %$* 13
argument. %$* 204
look, we have a disagreement here not just about what the first amendment means but about what democracy means. %$* 204
to me there is nothing more inconsistent with the notion of democracy than stifling speech, period. %$* 204
when a government comes in and says either, "you can't say that," or, "you can't say it too often, it's just going to have too much of an effect. %$* 204
and we're telling you, we, the government, the congress, we're telling you we're not going to allow that. %$* 204
and it's in your interest. %$* 204
it's really pro-democratic that we're doing that. %$* 204
you'll like it." that's why we have a first amendment. %$* 204
but, floyd, let me take the point that your opponents made in their opening statement, that spending is not just speech, it's actually action. %$* 13
and it's the accrual of power. %$* 13
it's the imposition of views, and that these have consequences, and that it's doing, not just talking, and that, therefore, i'm taking it the point being this overleaps just the issue of the first amendment. %$* 13
it's not just talking, but speech is never just talking. %$* 204
speech has impact. %$* 204
speech is dangerous. %$* 204
a lot of speech does harm. %$* 204
i mean, we live in a country that protects pornography, that protects a nazi's speech. %$* 204
we live on a country that protects-- %$* 204
i'm just thinking of the movie "the wolf of wall street" because of all the reference to corruption. %$* 204
no one in this country would imagine saying that, "you know, a movie that makes corruption look pretty good and drugs rather attractive can be banned because of its pro-corruption in some way." this country doesn't think that way. %$* 204
it is in the words of the supreme court in that case i quoted to you, "wholly foreign" to the first amendment to say that, you know, too much speech is too dangerous, that it can do harm, and it can hurt people. %$* 204
let's let zephyr respond to some of this. %$* 13
yes, well, floyd, there's something-- %$* 206
zephyr teachout. %$* 13
that you repeatedly do which is sort of make an elision between unlimited speech and speech itself. %$* 206
if you go back to the founding era and the first 200 years of this country, there is a great support for actual limits, like you need a seven-year residency before you can run for certain offices. %$* 206
you can't have elections without districts, but that doesn't mean you need unlimited districts. %$* 206
but is that-- %$* 13
no. %$* 206
in the first amendment? %$* 13
zephyr, who figures out, then, what the limits are for some rich guy, or a company, or a union? %$* 13
the key is the people. %$* 206
and floyd talks about the government as if the government is some alien other as opposed to one of the most extraordinary places in world history where we have figured out, in our fumbling way, but pretty well, how to have the government actually represent the-- %$* 206
can you hold on for just one-- %$* 13
will of the people. %$* 206
second-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 206
because i-- %$* 13
i'm going to bring it right back to you, but i just want to have you say your two sentences, because i heard you whisper. %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 51
the government is the other. %$* 51
okay. %$* 13
it is-- %$* 51
let's-- %$* 13
accountable to us, and we have to hold it accountable by being able to have unlimited criticism. %$* 51
okay. %$* 13
and when we have-- %$* 51
okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i'm stopping you there because – this was only an insert in zephyr's point. %$* 13
so, i'm going to let you continue. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 206
i don't want to limit the kinds of criticism. %$* 206
i want to empower the public, the people, to say that we need certain kinds of rules about bribery. %$* 206
we have them. %$* 51
and those rules about bribery implicates speech, but they're important rules. %$* 206
and one of those rules about bribery-- %$* 206
the founding fathers would have thought of all our campaign finance laws as anti-bribery laws. %$* 206
that's how teddy roosevelt talked about them. %$* 206
and that's how all the progressive populists talked about them, is understanding that these are anti-bribery laws, because whether or not you're in the same room and having a quid pro quo, you know that somebody's basic obligation to the public is lost when there's 2 million dollars spent to quash their campaign from a private interest. %$* 206
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to give it back to nadine in a second, but i – just want to say, after nadine-- %$* 13
after nadine's comments, i'd like to start taking questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
and once again, i want to ask you-- %$* 13
the way that this would work is you'll raise your hand. %$* 13
a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
i'll ask you to wait for the microphone so that the live stream audience can hear and the podcast listeners can hear you. %$* 13
just stand up. %$* 13
wait for the mic. %$* 13
hold it about as far away from your mouth as i am here so that you're crystal clear. %$* 13
state your name. %$* 13
and then ask a question. %$* 13
please make it a question. %$* 13
don't debate with the debaters, but just get them to debate with each other. %$* 13
so, i'm fine with a very short one-sentence statement of your premise, but then pop out a question. %$* 13
if a-- %$* 13
if a question mark naturally fits at the end of what you said – you have nailed this. %$* 13
nadine? %$* 13
well, bribery is already a crime. %$* 51
the far broader concept of corruption that zephyr has advocated here is one that says any time there happens to be an overlap between a position that somebody who contributes to a campaign advocates and what the candidate advocates-- %$* 51
that's corruption. %$* 51
that's not corruption. %$* 51
that is democracy in action. %$* 51
we spend money in support of candidates or issues because we agree with the positions they have already taken. %$* 51
when they are in office, they take those positions. %$* 51
they listen to their constituents. %$* 51
and by the way, every study that's been done to try to show a connection between spending and action shows that politicians are most influenced by their party, by their ideology, and by their constituents, not by donors. %$* 51
so, burt neuborne, your opponents are saying not only do you want to abrogate the first amendment, which they consider an illegitimate move, but that you're doing it without a very good reason, that the problem isn't what you say it is. %$* 13
if i had enough money to buy more time on this program-- %$* 205
if i could have 12 minutes and floyd could-- %$* 205
what are you offering, actually? %$* 13
only have six – i would do much better in this debate. %$* 205
so would i. %$* 204
and – the fact of the matter is, money buys influence. %$* 205
why do you think large corporations give to both republicans and democrats? %$* 205
you think it's because of seventh grade civics? %$* 205
but we're not talking about that kind of-- %$* 13
that kind of political money, where they're giving to the parties. %$* 13
we're talking about a group like moveon.org, making a documentary, or-- %$* 13
it-- %$* 205
somebody buying an ad in the newspaper. %$* 13
the idea that you were somehow not influenced by and not enormously grateful to some person who has independently spent money to put you into office is a fiction. %$* 205
there's no difference between contributions and independent spending in the sense that the politician who knows that his or her staying in office depends on continuing to get that money-- %$* 205
that's a politician who can't do what zephyr said the founders wanted. %$* 205
the founders wanted-- %$* 205
maybe this is an ideal that is impossible to achieve. %$* 205
but the founders wanted a representative democracy where the representatives would think, "what's good for us all? %$* 205
what is the common good? %$* 205
not what's my largest donor want? %$* 205
now, whether or not you could do that – “ %$* 205
i'm going to go to questions now, and if you can just raise your hand. %$* 13
sir, right in the middle, you've got a blue blazer on. %$* 13
if you stand up, the mic will come to you. %$* 13
my name is david keating. %$* 18
i'd like to go back to the text for a minute and ask you, this idea that you can limit money or limit speech, if that principle is right, what does that mean to the free exercise of religion and freedom of press? %$* 18
does this mean that congress could limit the amount of money spent on religion and publishing? %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
i'm taking it that's a question for the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
that's a great question. %$* 204
do you want to do it? %$* 206
and the other side loves the question. %$* 13
burt neuborne. %$* 13
it's a great question. %$* 205
but in each of those situations, you have to answer the antecedent question that i asked, is that is, is it speech, is it religion, or is it the press? %$* 205
because if it isn't, then you don't get a freedom of-- %$* 205
"get out of jail" card. %$* 205
so if i make up a phony religion and run around and tell people that my religion consists of stealing money from other people so that i can advance my own principles, i would expect anybody in this room and a court to tell me bologna, you're not entitled to be treated as a religion because you are not engaged in religion. %$* 205
and i'm suggesting when you're spending astronomical amounts of money, you're not engaged in speech. %$* 205
let's have floyd abrams respond to that point. %$* 13
well, let me-- %$* 204
a round of applause, and then – %$* 13
i wanted to repeat-- %$* 204
okay. %$* 204
floyd abrams. %$* 13
i want to repeat burt's last line. %$* 204
he said if that's what you're doing, you're not engaged in speech. %$* 204
the problem that they're addressing is nothing but speech. %$* 204
their problem is the money goes, and it buys lots of ads. %$* 204
it buys speech. %$* 204
if it didn't buy that, it's nothing. %$* 204
that's their articulation of the problem. %$* 204
it just cannot, in my view, be plausibly argued that this is not a speech issue or not a freedom of speech issue. %$* 204
if you wanted to say to us, there are other interests you're not thinking enough about, or sometimes freedom of speech gets trumped by some national security issue or something like that, you know, we could have that debate. %$* 204
but this debate, we're having a debate now where our opponents are telling us that all these ads aren't even speech, that all this money that they find so offensive, which is going into the purchase of what? %$* 204
things designed to persuade you. %$* 204
let's let zephyr teachout respond. %$* 13
or a political purpose, whatever the ultimate-- %$* 204
zephyr. %$* 13
whatever the aims are, even taking the most venal aims-- %$* 204
okay, floyd, hang on. %$* 13
i want to let zephyr respond to some of what you've said already. %$* 13
so i think we haven't talked enough about what the core purpose of the first amendment is. %$* 206
i mentioned it briefly. %$* 206
but the idea that the speech, the freedom of speech that i see is a freedom to speak about politics, about any issue in any way you want without government censorship. %$* 206
and we've seen two equivalences here that i think are very dangerous equivalences, and they get sort of snuck in. %$* 206
one is that ads are speech, as opposed to-- %$* 206
and not-- %$* 206
and the other is that constituencies-- %$* 206
wait. %$* 13
just for some clarity, why are ads not-- %$* 13
why are ads not speech? %$* 13
well, let me-- %$* 205
okay. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
just for the radio audience now, your partner is taking this question. %$* 13
okay, so my partner's taking this question, although i'm happy to pile on. %$* 206
all right. %$* 13
burt neuborne. %$* 13
a metaphor: suppose i had a huge megaphone or some way to amplify my speech, and i kept turning it up, and i kept turning it, and it kept getting louder, and it kept getting louder. %$* 205
at some point, although i was technically involved in speech, i would be involved in an exercise of power. %$* 205
and so what i'm saying is that at some point spending morphs into power when it is so high-- %$* 205
okay. %$* 13
that what you're doing now-- %$* 205
and then the other-- %$* 51
over and over and over. %$* 205
that's a completely-- %$* 51
all right. %$* 13
hold it, hold it. %$* 13
burt, you've made that point twice, and i took it once to your opponents. %$* 13
but the fact that you've come back a second time tells me you're not satisfied with the answer and nadine is ready to go with it. %$* 13
nadine strossen. %$* 13
it's not a fair analogy because-- %$* 51
then that's why i reject this drowning out metaphor that's often used by my opponents here, because it is true that if i shouted really loud then maybe you wouldn't literally be able to hear them. %$* 51
that is literally a drowning out. %$* 51
but to amplify speech by spending more money so that it reaches more people or that it's more effectively created or more persuasive does not drown out anybody else's speech. %$* 51
moreover, it does not translate-- %$* 51
wait. %$* 13
how can you-- %$* 13
the argument they're making is so out-- %$* 206
i want to talk how radical this is because-- %$* 206
zephyr teachout. %$* 13
it is against-- %$* 206
i love being %$* 51
what constitutional lawyers thought for the first 200 years of this country, and that they recognized the importance of protecting the ability to speak one's conscience did not extend to the ability to spend unlimited money. %$* 206
these are separate ideas. %$* 206
and if we equate them, we really equate them at our peril. %$* 206
and it is very similar to the equation that you just heard nadine talk about, which is-- %$* 206
but zephyr-- %$* 13
saying that constituents %$* 206
just a reality check on the point that nadine was making about, there's a point where you can shout louder than anybody else. %$* 13
is it just not self-evident that if one-- %$* 13
one point of view has billions-- %$* 13
millions of dollars behind it, putting ads on television-- %$* 13
i know you don't call those speech-- %$* 13
that that does in fact drown out the other side. %$* 13
wait, no. %$* 51
oh, i'm arguing-- %$* 13
sorry, that was meant for you. %$* 13
we enthusiastically endorse that. %$* 205
i mean, that-- %$* 51
that's never happened before. %$* 13
that could only-- %$* 51
i've stepped through the mirror. %$* 13
that could only-- %$* 51
sorry. %$* 13
nadine. %$* 13
that could only literally be true in what i assume is a hypothetical situation that somebody literally bought up every single minute of tv time so the other person didn't have a chance to-- %$* 51
so would that not be a problem? %$* 13
every study shows and elections show that these ads reach a point of diminishing returns. %$* 51
you know. %$* 51
how often do you turn off the tv or hang up on the robo calls? %$* 51
so there is a diminishing marginal return from extra expenditures. %$* 51
we are-- %$* 51
and that's why they spend it because they know it doesn't work. %$* 205
smart enough not to be persuaded just because somebody is advertising more and more. %$* 51
let me go to another question. %$* 13
and by the way, that last question was superb in how it stimulated continuing debate. %$* 13
sir, right down-- %$* 13
you have a card you're looking at. %$* 13
were you raising your hand? %$* 13
yeah, it's you. %$* 13
and if you can stand up please too. %$* 13
i actually have a question for both sides. %$* 18
would i be able to pose? %$* 18
no. %$* 13
just pick one. %$* 13
pick the best. %$* 13
okay then. %$* 18
maybe i'm misinterpreting nadine's point, but what about speech that isn't dissent? %$* 18
i feel like you were kind of implying that what is applicable is only dissent towards the government. %$* 18
and that was it. %$* 18
okay. %$* 51
well, by definition, any political speech is going to be dissenting from either-- %$* 51
from one candidate or another candidate from one policy or another policy, right? %$* 51
you are-- %$* 51
even if ostensibly-- %$* 51
let's say i'm arguing in favor of the supreme court decisions protecting free speech, that is to disagree with those who take an opposite position; members of congress who pass campaign-- %$* 51
limits on campaign spending. %$* 51
so every opportunity to comment on a government policy, by definition, involves the right to dissent. %$* 51
i just want to also-- %$* 206
zephyr teachout. %$* 13
point out what i continue to see happening. %$* 206
so they keep saying this is a debate about reality and talking about the kinds of realities that we see. %$* 206
i think it was explicitly in the most recent supreme court decision, a debate about reality. %$* 206
the majority used the word "reality" a lot, and the dissent was talking about what's really happening. %$* 206
and i think your question goes to this, if the first amendment is for protecting dissent, let's talk about what unlimited money in politics is already really doing in the last four years and what it is really doing in the last four years is corrupting our system so it makes it impossible for candidates to actually do their best job and serve the public. %$* 206
and that's the reality, not the word dissent, but the reality, the political reality. %$* 206
and i don't-- %$* 204
floyd abrams, quick response. %$* 13
i don't think the last four years reflect anything of the sort. %$* 204
i think we've had a lot of unpleasant disagreeable and, from my own political perspective, outrageous speech, but we haven't lacked for speech, and we haven't lacked for all sides being represented in a public debate. %$* 204
and indeed that happens more and more with the internet and more and more because it is easier for less and less money to get messages out. %$* 204
that's the reality. %$* 204
and more competition. %$* 51
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator, we have four debaters, two teams of two, who are debating this motion: individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech. %$* 13
let's go back to questions. %$* 13
ma'am, right up there. %$* 13
isn't it if constitutional right is absolute, why would speech be different? %$* 19
not even true. %$* 19
there is no right to shout, "fire," in a crowded theater, so, therefore, why wouldn't limitations on spending, even if speech be reasonable with a showing of a compelling interest? %$* 19
ma'am, do you think that, that's what you hear this side arguing-- %$* 13
that the right to unlimited spending on your political speech is absolute? %$* 13
do you think that's what you're hearing them say? %$* 13
there's-- %$* 19
first of all-- %$* 19
wait, what was your answer to that? %$* 13
i just wanted to %$* 19
no, i want to know if you think that's what their claim is. %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
yes. %$* 18
yes? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it's mine, too, and i just-- %$* 13
i want to see if-- %$* 13
are you, in fact, making that argument, that it is absolute and there is no-- %$* 13
there are no exceptions, there is no %$* 13
no, and, first of all, there is a right to shout, "fire," in a theater if the theater is on fire. %$* 51
you want people to shout it. %$* 51
and by paraphrasing that the way 99 percent of people do wrongly, you miss the central point which answers your question, which is that only if the speech in that case is false and, therefore, it leads to a harm-- %$* 51
directly leads to a harm that can't be averted in any other way, then and only then may you restrict speech as a last resort. %$* 51
so if we could show that there was some harm that is definitely going to occur and can only be averted by restricting speech, then we can do so. %$* 51
that is exactly why we can have laws against bribery even though bribery is committed through speech, laws against extortion. %$* 51
but there has-- %$* 51
with all the trials there is no evidence that there is undue influence that causes this enormous harm that is positive. %$* 51
it's all speculative, that's why the supreme court has talked about the appearance of corruption. %$* 51
it's because there's no evidence of actual corruption. %$* 51
all right. %$* 13
nadine, let's let burt neuborne respond to your point. %$* 13
so let me tell you the two harms, nadine. %$* 205
the first harm is the destruction of political equality, the fact that we all know we live in a country now where it is a sham to say that we have a fundamental egalitarian democracy. %$* 205
we have a plutocracy that's run by the rich, and that harm seeps into every piece of our democratic fiber, including the alienation that turns people off from democracy and keeps people from voting in the first place. %$* 205
and the second harm is corruption, the corruption that zephyr talked about, the fact that we have representatives-- %$* 205
who don't have to be bribed. %$* 205
they don't have to be in the same room and get a quid pro quo. %$* 205
a wink and a nod and a day at the country club is plenty of time to send the message that, "we expect you to support us on this." %$* 205
okay, so-- %$* 13
and i'll ask the last thing, whose telephone call do they take after the election, your telephone call or the guy that gave him $2 million? %$* 205
that's the corruption. %$* 205
all right. %$* 13
so, nadine, you got a direct response to your challenge. %$* 13
tell us what the harms are that would justify curbing this right. %$* 13
and if you-- %$* 51
and you got two answers there. %$* 13
and i disagree with both of them. %$* 51
and let me say that-- %$* 51
so, again, we've had all these trials, there is no evidence, we're just hearing conclusory allegations here, but in 100,000 pages of testimony, and in these cases not a single instance could be proven of that kind of alleged harm, which is exactly why the supreme court has said, "well, we can recognize just the potential appearance or the risk of harm."another requirement, prerequisite, before limiting speech, as i said, is that the limitation is necessary. %$* 51
if there is a less restrictive alternative that will protect the values that are being asserted, prevent the harm, that's less restrictive of speech, you have to use that. %$* 51
and what we advocate, and the supreme court has upheld, is disclosure, immediately disclose, fully disclose where the money is. %$* 51
and we, the people, can be trusted to hold people-- %$* 51
politicians accountable accordingly. %$* 51
another question, sir, yeah, that's-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 208
my name is theodore simon and i'm happy to say, which will be evident by the question, i'm a philadelphia lawyer. %$* 208
and my question goes to the way you frame the question, which is "individuals and organizations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech."and whether you reframe it or whether to this side i guess, to the right side of you, would it be any different if it was framed that "for profit corporations," that's "for profit corporations," because you've only alluded to organization, for-profit corporations have a constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech, but more particularly, for their own candidate and campaign spending. %$* 208
the-- %$* 204
well, my-- %$* 204
i'm sorry. %$* 204
i thought you were addressing it to us. %$* 204
it is-- %$* 13
it is addressed to you. %$* 13
i'm just-- %$* 13
i'm just questioning whether anybody here has eliminated for profit in their understanding of this motion. %$* 13
i'm fine with the question, but i'm just surprised that you felt the conversation was going in that direction. %$* 13
but floyd abrams, why don't you take it? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 204
there is evidence about what happens with respect to for-profits. %$* 204

and now to open what is our spring season of our fifth year of intelligence squared u.s.the chairman of the organization that makes it all possible, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well thank you all. %$* 1
thank you all for braving the weather to come and for joining us tonight. %$* 1
you know i do have in addition to my role on intelligence squared a day job and it’s running an insurance company which gets around two percent of its premiums from medical insurance. %$* 1
so this debate is not very material to our business but i thought i should share that fact with you in the interest of full disclosure. %$* 1
you know, i also want to share some of my own insurance expertise as it relates to tonight’s motion. %$* 1
what seems clear to me is that healthcare costs are out of control. %$* 1
they amount to around 16 percent of the u.s.economy compared to nine percent in other rich countries. %$* 1
health costs have been a major drag on employment and growth and have jeopardized the financial position of the federal government, state governments and frankly we have no better health outcomes to show for these costs. %$* 1
in considering the arguments of our panelists tonight, you might want to think about the effect of this bill on costs. %$* 1
there is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to address medicare costs in particular. %$* 1
after all, some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in america are incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life. %$* 1
some republicans, by the way, have been quite disingenuous about this, raising the specter of “death panels” and world war ii vets languishing without appropriate care. %$* 1
but another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers, medical malpractice insurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that they foster. %$* 1
democrats, traditional allies of the tort bar, have hardly been forthright about this aspect of the situation. %$* 1
another factor is that consumers of health care generally have little incentive to control costs. %$* 1
why should they economize if insurance companies are paying? %$* 1
most insurance covers things you can’t budget. %$* 1
car insurance doesn’t cover oil changes. %$* 1
home owners insurance doesn’t cover a soiled rug. %$* 1
but when it comes to health insurance, we expect coverage of every conceivable medical benefit. %$* 1
most insurance policies are priced to reflect risk. %$* 1
teenagers pay more for auto insurance. %$* 1
smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth. %$* 1
but for health coverage, most states have mandated that everyone in the community pays the same. %$* 1
what this means is that healthy young people pay excessive premiums they can’t well afford in order to subsidize their better-off but more illness prone elders. %$* 1
they often quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage. %$* 1
this bill would force them to do so. %$* 1
but whether requiring someone to purchase something they don’t want is even constitutional will surely be touched on in tonight’s debate. %$* 1
so in considering the arguments you’ll hear this evening, i encourage you to listen with the following kinds of questions in mind. %$* 1
does the bill address unproductive and undignified end-of-life care? %$* 1
does it rein in tort lawyers to discourage defensive medicine? %$* 1
does it encourage us as consumers to care about what we spend? %$* 1
does it provide appropriate incentives for healthy life styles and preventive care? %$* 1
these are not rhetorical questions. %$* 1
but they’re very complex just like the bill we’re discussing. %$* 1
we have a stellar roster of panelists to help illuminate these issues and it’s now my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, robert. %$* 13
and i would just like another round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
two words, “repeal obamacare,” that is our motion. %$* 13
that is what we are here to debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on hundreds of npr stations across the nation for another debate from intelligence squared u.s. “repeal obamacare,” and to debate this motion we have a congressman, presidential advisers, and a man who has written more about the topic than anybody, i think we can say literally. %$* 13
and in this debate, we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience. %$* 13
you act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team that has been most persuasive, that has changed most of your minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to our preliminary vote. %$* 13
go to those key pads at the right hand side of your seat. %$* 13
our motion is "repeal obamacare." and if you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you're for repeal, it's number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, it you are against repeal, it's number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided, it's number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we're locking out the system, and we will present the results of both votes at the end of the debate. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
our motion is it "repeal obamacare." and first, to argue for this motion, for repeal, i'd like to introduce john shadegg, a congressman from arizona. %$* 13
let me say, former congressman. %$* 13
after eight terms, john shadegg decided to step away from the job which is not something that a lot of people in your position-- %$* 13
actually, he tried twice. %$* 13
the first time-- %$* 13
the first time your fellow republicans asked you not to leave. %$* 13
that's true. %$* 459
finally, you got away, john. %$* 13
and they liked your rhetoric, which included on this topic a reference to the obama reform program as soviet style gulag healthcare. %$* 13
i want to say, come now. %$* 13
hey. %$* 13
do you stand by that? %$* 13
no. %$* 459
i think that it is a-- %$* 459
it is a part of the dialogue that you try to get attention. %$* 459
and that was an attempt to gather some attention. %$* 459
and it worked. %$* 13
we'll see what else you have to say tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john shadegg. %$* 13
thank you very much, john. %$* 459
and thank you to the audience. %$* 459
you play a key role here tonight. %$* 459
i want to thank intelligence squared for sponsoring this debate. %$* 459
and i want to recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world on this topic. %$* 459
and most of all, i want to thank my debate partner, douglas holtz-eakin, former cbo director and a senior policy advisor to senator john mccain. %$* 459
my partner, douglas holtz-eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers. %$* 459
and i believe he will be able to clearly show you that obamacare both won't work and perhaps more importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability. %$* 459
let me begin, however, by refuting two arguments. %$* 459
first, supporters of obamacare will say that republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo. %$* 459
that is simply wrong. %$* 459
i believe in my tenure in congress i had written more healthcare reform bills than any other member of congress. %$* 459
i wrote a number of patients rights bills in the early debate. %$* 459
but i was also joined throughout this with the help of paul ryan and tom coburn and jim demint and richard burr and dr. %$* 459
tom price and dr. %$* 459
burgess and on and on. %$* 459
and you would find countless proposals by republicans to reform our nation's healthcare. %$* 459
second, supporters of obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government money. %$* 459
and they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money. %$* 459
now, douglas holtz-eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded. %$* 459
but i urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense. %$* 459
obamacare insures roughly 32 million additional americans, most through medicaid. %$* 459
that will increase costs. %$* 459
it creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and bureaus. %$* 459
that's got to increase costs. %$* 459
and it extends dramatic new mandates over health insurance in america. %$* 459
and that will increase costs. %$* 459
now, let me move on to one point that i think is very important to understand. %$* 459
the current system is in fact broken. %$* 459
as i said, i have written numerous bills to try to fix it. %$* 459
costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly. %$* 459
there are too many uninsured and too many americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get affordable coverage. %$* 459
i have a pre-existing condition, and i have an older sister who has-- %$* 459
who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition. %$* 459
one aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible. %$* 459
it's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free. %$* 459
it costs them no taxes and you no taxes. %$* 459
but it punishes those without employee-provided care. %$* 459
indeed, it tells them, we want you to get insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it a third more expensive. %$* 459
that is simply outrageous and indefensible. %$* 459
and stunningly, obamacare does not fix that problem. %$* 459
obamacare is simply the wrong answer. %$* 459
first, it addresses symptoms, namely the uninsured, which are too high. %$* 459
but it does not address, i do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost. %$* 459
second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your premiums. %$* 459
and the experts agree on that point. %$* 459
it moves-- %$* 459
and perhaps this is most important-- %$* 459
healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding. %$* 459
but it doesn't give those decisions to you and me. %$* 459
it gives them to the government. %$* 459
what we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people. %$* 459
give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions. %$* 459
republican proposals in congress do exactly that. %$* 459
why? %$* 459
because if the health insurance is yours, not your employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you. %$* 459
you can make the changes. %$* 459
you aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked. %$* 459
you can force the insurance companies to compete, which they don't do now. %$* 459
you can hire the plan of your choice. %$* 459
and because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you. %$* 459
briefly, let me touch on why obamacare will drive costs up. %$* 459
by its terms, obamacare institutes lots of mandates. %$* 459
one is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned down. %$* 459
that will increase cost. %$* 459
one is modified community rating. %$* 459
that will increase costs. %$* 459
and a third is an array of new benefit mandates. %$* 459
all of those will increase costs. %$* 459
indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically. %$* 459
in massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to obamacare, costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average. %$* 459
let me touch on some of obamacare's broken promises. %$* 459
the president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your plan, you can keep it. %$* 459
not true. %$* 459
he said if you like your doctor, you can keep it. %$* 459
you can keep him or her. %$* 459
not true. %$* 459
and he said that obamacare would send the cost curve down. %$* 459
none of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true. %$* 459
the medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage. %$* 459
leading experts say few plans will actually survive. %$* 459
how could they survive? %$* 459
they have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written. %$* 459
in fact, thousands of americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it. %$* 459
they will lose their healthcare. %$* 459
at&t, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed at&t will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care and pay the fine. %$* 459
john deere will lose $150 million a year. %$* 459
caterpillar, $100 million a year. %$* 459
3m, $90 million a year. %$* 459
the numbers go on and on. %$* 459
those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care. %$* 459
they'll be forced. %$* 459
and think about their workers. %$* 459
their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor. %$* 459
we simply have to do better than that. %$* 459
the new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code is now. %$* 459
it provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange. %$* 459
and if you join the exchange, you can get a government subsidy. %$* 459
but if you have employer-provided care, you cannot join the exchange. %$* 459
that simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care. %$* 459
thank you very much. %$* 459
john shadegg, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 459
thank you, john shadegg. %$* 13
we're debating a motion, "repeal obamacare" in this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now to argue against the motion, paul starr, who is a professor of sociology and public affairs at princeton. %$* 13
he's a pulitzer prize winner for his book on healthcare called “the social transformation of american medicine.” paul, you also were an advisor to president clinton the first time the democrats tried to pull off a major reform and failed. %$* 13
what got right this time that you got wrong last time to at least get the act-- %$* 13
get the law passed? %$* 13
well, i think one of the big differences this time was more consensus. %$* 460
might seem strange in the light of what congressman shadegg has said, but more consensus among democrats in congress, consensus between the white house and congress, more consensus also with the stakeholder groups in healthcare who realize that the current course is unsustainable, that we need to change and-- %$* 460
well, let me let you get launched on your seven minutes. %$* 13
okay, well, because-- %$* 460
i feel like i should deduct. %$* 13
all right. %$* 460
i'm joking. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul starr. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 460
we should uphold the affordable care act because it is morally the right thing to do and it is in our common interest. %$* 460
and when i first began work on the healthcare back in the 1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population. %$* 460
by the early '90s, it was up to 37 million. %$* 460
now it's reached 50 million. %$* 460
and if we were to do the kinds of things that the congressman has advocated, the number will go higher. %$* 460
fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose everything they have because of illness. %$* 460
for years surveys have shown that anxiety about not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of americans' anxieties. %$* 460
and americans are more likely-- %$* 460
much more likely than people in the other rich democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost. %$* 460
still, the majority of americans, and i guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of those who already have protection. %$* 460
the affordable care act is an intelligently crafted effort to do that. %$* 460
it extends coverage in two ways, by expanding medicaid for poor people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no more than eight percent of income. %$* 460
now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept. %$* 460
massachusetts has a working exchange, the health connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by governor mitt romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties. %$* 460
if you move to massachusetts, you can use the connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle. %$* 460
no wonder brokers don’t like the idea of the insurance exchange but we don’t kill off expedia or travelocity for the sake of the travel agents, do we? %$* 460
and currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the congressman wants, 30 cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and marketing costs. %$* 460
the exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the system. %$* 460
in regard to coverage, the affordable care act is modeled on the massachusetts reforms. %$* 460
it does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance. %$* 460
the origins of this idea go back to old republicans-- %$* 460
republican proposals, to a plan that richard nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by senator john chafee, with 20 republican cosponsors, back in 1981-- %$* 460
1991, a bill by the way that had an individual mandate in it. %$* 460
and substantively, the affordable care act is bipartisan legislation. %$* 460
we just don’t happen to live in a bipartisan political era. %$* 460
consider the law's moderate responsible approach to financing. %$* 460
the basic idea is to find most of the money to expand coverage from within the healthcare system. %$* 460
we spend enough on healthcare, we just don’t allocate it well. %$* 460
healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers, and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in medicare payments, and by cutting excessive payments to private medicare plans. %$* 460
the law also imposes a tax on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to douglas holtz-eakin because he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was john mccain’s health policy advisor. %$* 460
our republican friends will tell you that this legislation will explode the deficit, even though the cbo tells us it will reduce the deficit. %$* 460
now, jon is my partner in this. %$* 460
jon cohn is going to talk more about cost. %$* 460
but while you're listening to the other side, please bear in mind that when bill clinton left office we were looking at a $3.1 trillion surplus back then. %$* 460
and bush came in, cut taxes, passed a medicare prescription drug benefit with no financing, sent us to war in iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit exploded. %$* 460
it exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the great recession. %$* 460
what happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between 2001 and 2006 when republicans had control of both the white house and congress? %$* 460
what did they do about health care costs? %$* 460
here are the facts. %$* 460
family health insurance premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a decline of three percent in real median household income. %$* 460
faced with a potential death spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed healthcare reform in the past, the american medical association, the hospitals, the for- profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be changed. %$* 460
and that’s why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the democrats but because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it-- %$* 460
to change it. %$* 460
now just a word on mr. %$* 460
shadegg’s proposals. %$* 460
we have low-regulation states, states that don’t regulate the insurance industry. %$* 460
his own state of arizona is one of those states and their costs are just as high as elsewhere. %$* 460
arizona has 20 percent uninsured. %$* 460
the high deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and other republicans favor and put into law haven’t shown any sign of reducing costs or extending coverage. %$* 460
they are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if you’re in a high tax bracket, it’s great to have a health savings account. %$* 460
you can put money in the account, don’t even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after age 65 without penalty. %$* 460
so those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy and well-off. %$* 460
they just don’t happen to do much for the low-income workers and the others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare. %$* 460
sir, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion, “repeal obamacare.” you have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third. %$* 13
to argue for the motion, to argue for the repeal of obamacare, i’d like to introduce douglas holtz-eakin, who is president of the american action forum. %$* 13
he was with the mccain campaign as an adviser and in his critiques of the obama health plan, came up with the telling phrase, “fantasy in, fantasy out.”i believe that’s yours. %$* 13
you own that. %$* 13
you also-- %$* 13
not very profitable but i own it. %$* 461
yes. %$* 13
i also learned through google another delicious fact-- %$* 13
you were a good sport about it-- %$* 13
but after leaving the mccain campaign, you couldn’t get health insurance for some time. %$* 13
not exactly right but i have a pre-existing condition. %$* 461
actually, i have two kidneys on my left side from some extensive work before the 21st century and i was left on cobra coverage and the solution, of course, is to start your own employer so i started a think tank to get insurance. %$* 461
so you’re covered. %$* 13
i am covered. %$* 461
you took it the hard way. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our opponents. %$* 461
you know, i’m going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, you’ve all realized that what we’re debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the united states because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform. %$* 461
my own history, john’s history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of which i’m unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the united states. %$* 461
real healthcare reform has two pieces. %$* 461
number one, it extends healthcare coverage to americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare. %$* 461
in the end, an insurance system takes the nation’s health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to. %$* 461
the second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall healthcare bill. %$* 461
and the united states has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get. %$* 461
at one-sixth of our economy, it’s one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine. %$* 461
and the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades. %$* 461
if you look at income per person in the united states and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades. %$* 461
republicans, democrats alike. %$* 461
it is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums. %$* 461
and if you don't control costs, you cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about. %$* 461
i favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform. %$* 461
it does not deal with the cost problem. %$* 461
now, i don't need to say so. %$* 461
many people, far more qualified than i, have said so. %$* 461
the congressional budget office, in the aftermath of passage of the affordable care act, put out its new long-term care-- %$* 461
or its new long-term budget projections. %$* 461
did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this? %$* 461
no, it does not. %$* 461
you can look at the cms actuary, the administration, the obama administration's own chief actuary, richard foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of medicare, not make it more solid. %$* 461
you can ask jonathan gruber. %$* 461
jonathan gruber is one of the architects of obamacare. %$* 461
he's one of the architects of the massachusetts reform on which obamacare was founded. %$* 461
and in his article in the journal of policy analysis and management, he says, “this isn't about cost reform. %$* 461
this is health insurance reform. %$* 461
there's nothing in it. %$* 461
much like massachusetts, it's just about covering people. %$* 461
it doesn't control costs.” and you can look at the experience in massachusetts where, prior to reform, massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average. %$* 461
and after reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform. %$* 461
so we need to get the healthcare reform. %$* 461
and without that, we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation. %$* 461
now, i'm a former cbo director. %$* 461
it is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future. %$* 461
i'll spare you the numbers tonight because i like you more than my children. %$* 461
but the bottom line is this nation, looking forward-- %$* 461
forget re-litigating the past. %$* 461
mr. %$* 461
starr is good at that. %$* 461
but looking forward in the administration’s budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after we’re soon to be out of iraq, out of iran, after the economy is back at five percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars. %$* 461
nine hundred billion of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing. %$* 461
we are headed to that magical position where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. %$* 461
along the road, we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation. %$* 461
we will no longer be a top- rated borrower. %$* 461
this act makes that situation worse, not better. %$* 461
it says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow, according to cbo, at eight percent a year, as far as the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent. %$* 461
revenue's not going to grow at eight percent. %$* 461
the only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors and gimmicks. %$* 461
and that's what the affordable care act is riddled with, in which the cbo was forced to acknowledge in its score. %$* 461
if you give them handcuffs, they'll come up with any answer that you might want. %$* 461
so we can't afford this as a nation. %$* 461
it is dangerous because it doesn't control costs. %$* 461
it's not really healthcare reform. %$* 461
you need to vote for healthcare reform, not obamacare. %$* 461
one sixth of our economy is underperforming. %$* 461
if we care about economic performance, we should repeal obamacare. %$* 461
forget the mandates, forget the taxes. %$* 461
we had a system that was broken to begin with. %$* 461
one-sixth of our economy is broken. %$* 461
why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it? %$* 461
but you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues of fairness. %$* 461
let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed. %$* 461
there are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000. %$* 461
one's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income. %$* 461
the other's going to get zip. %$* 461
that is grotesquely unfair. %$* 461
and if any future congress acts pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond. %$* 461
they'll give everybody the money. %$* 461
and my first problem will blow up even worse. %$* 461
terrible idea. %$* 461
and for every young person in this audience, this is a disaster. %$* 461
through the individual mandate you'll be obligated to be in the pool. %$* 461
the purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you. %$* 461
and at the end of your life, you get to pick up the debt that's been incurred through obamacare. %$* 461
you'll get it at the front end. %$* 461
you'll get it at the back end. %$* 461
it is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the united states congress. %$* 461
should be repealed on those grounds alone. %$* 461
there are other sort of detours along the way. %$* 461
the insurance companies, that's where all the costs come from. %$* 461
oh, my god, there are administrative costs. %$* 461
there are profits. %$* 461
the top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion. %$* 461
that's a lot of money. %$* 461
i'd like to have it. %$* 461
the cost growth problem every year is $175 billion. %$* 461
so go for it. %$* 461
nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits. %$* 461
you get about a year and a half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were. %$* 461
this isn't about insurance companies. %$* 461
this is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs. %$* 461
and the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix medicare, which is at the root of our problems. %$* 461
medicare pays doctors. %$* 461
it pays hospitals. %$* 461
it pays some insurance companies, and it pays drug companies. %$* 461
and it has silos to pay them all. %$* 461
and nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary. %$* 461
nowhere in there can you get coordination of care. %$* 461
nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare americans deserve. %$* 461
we should fix that first. %$* 461
we should repeal this now. %$* 461
thank you. %$* 461
thank you, douglas holtz-eakin. %$* 13
our motion, "repeal obamacare" and our final speaker in opening statements to speak against the motion, jonathan cohn who is a senior editor at the new republic. %$* 13
he wrote a book called “sick: the untold story of america's healthcare crisis,” which in some ways explains his evolution from pure journalist into advocate with these scores and scores of stories of people in dire straits that he reported and is very passionate about. %$* 13
you also had a blog throughout the debate called the treatment. %$* 13
and you signed off, after the legislation passed, saying, and i quote you, "the debate has ended." so why are we here? %$* 13
i like to think it's been a full employment act for people like me who write about healthcare. %$* 462
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan cohn. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 462
i want to thank the audience. %$* 462
i want to thank the foundation. %$* 462
i want to thank my opponents. %$* 462
i want to thank doug holtz-eakin in particular for some of the comments he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control, we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire society. %$* 462
and you know, i agree with all of that. %$* 462
i do. %$* 462
where we differ you may-- %$* 462
as you may imagine, is that i happen to think the affordable care act, obamacare, helps us in that regard. %$* 462
now, you listened to this team over here. %$* 462
you've listened to their argument. %$* 462
and they painted a very dire picture of a program out of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks. %$* 462
it's going to leave us all paying tons in insurance premiums. %$* 462
and you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture because i think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that-- %$* 462
about the benefits of the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down, subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now. %$* 462
people like that. %$* 462
they think that is a good idea. %$* 462
so they focus on this cost question. %$* 462
and, you know, during the healthcare debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply not in the with all due respect to my-- %$* 462
to our debating opponents here who i know have spent a lot of time talking about it, i think they're giving you, well, i don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs but i think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things. %$* 462
so i did two things here. %$* 462
first, i want to explain why i have faith that the obama healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs. %$* 462
and i want to specifically go through some of the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading. %$* 462
now, why do i have faith that this healthcare bill will save money? %$* 462
i mean isn't-- %$* 462
congressman shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't? %$* 462
i don't think it's common sense. %$* 462
i look around the world. %$* 462
i look at countries like france and germany and switzerland and japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better, people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do. %$* 462
now, is there something about the united states that we're not capable? %$* 462
we're not innovative enough? %$* 462
we can't do that? %$* 462
i don't think so. %$* 462
certainly it is possible, certainly, to get excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money. %$* 462
so the question is, will this bill do it? %$* 462
and i believe it will. %$* 462
let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that. %$* 462
it has three basic approaches. %$* 462
one is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste. %$* 462
a lot of it's corporate welfare. %$* 462
right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits through medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much. %$* 462
they're making too much in profits. %$* 462
so we say we're going to take some of that back. %$* 462
we're going to take back that corporate welfare. %$* 462
another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes. %$* 462
and we get money from there. %$* 462
now, i don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan. %$* 462
now, they may not like those ideas. %$* 462
and that's fine. %$* 462
and maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare. %$* 462
why the richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during the clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more. %$* 462
but it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most important. %$* 462
and this is where we really look at the way the american medical care system works. %$* 462
everybody who is-- %$* 462
every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in our medical care system. %$* 462
some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different insurance companies. %$* 462
some of this is duplicative treatments because dr. %$* 462
a doesn't know what dr. %$* 462
b is doing to patient c.some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for treatments that don't work. %$* 462
the obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attack those, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is not something crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the left and the right. %$* 462
it's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital infection. %$* 462
it's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of what patients are getting as they move through the medical system. %$* 462
it's about giving financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention, and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe will help control healthcare costs. %$* 462
now, douglas holtz-eakin got up here and said these numbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, common sense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the congressional budget office. %$* 462
congressional budget office is the gold standard of accounting. %$* 462
the cbo-- %$* 462
my reading of the cbo report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, "you know what? %$* 462
this bill will reduce the deficit. %$* 462
it will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, it will reduce it by a lot more afterwards." and by the way, the rate of growth in healthcare spending is going to start to slow down. %$* 462
now, it is true that the cbo, you can say, "well, the cbo ought to use these rules," or whatever. %$* 462
well, what the cbo rules mean is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented, and that is the way-- %$* 462
and that is the way the government accounting system works. %$* 462
douglas holtz-eakin says, "well, that never works because we've never seen it happen." well, you know what? %$* 462
it's happened before. %$* 462
during the late 1990s we tried to control costs in medicare and we did for a while. %$* 462
we passed very large cuts to medicare during the balanced budget act. %$* 462
it was the late 1990s, and you know what? %$* 462
those cuts stuck, and we were able to reduce the growth of medicare from where it would’ve been otherwise. %$* 462
it’s entirely possible to do this. %$* 462
now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program. %$* 462
as my colleague mentioned, during the bush administration they passed a different-- %$* 462
they tried to approach healthcare in a different way. %$* 462
they said, “all right, let’s try a different approach, and let’s have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it.” well, that did increase the deficit, and that is the sort of choice we’re talking about facing here. %$* 462
now, my colleague-- %$* 462
my opponent, mr. %$* 462
holtz-eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed, and he said, “well, john gruber of mit says this is not good,” or he said, “the cms actuary said this." well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people-- %$* 462
the list of experts who have endorsed this, it’s not just the congressional budget office, it’s people like david cutler, a professor at harvard university, who won the john base clark medal for the most accomplished economist under 40. %$* 462
it's people like jonathan gruber from mit-- %$* 462
i know he quoted jonathan gruber-- %$* 462
jonathan gruber has said many times he endorses this bill. %$* 462
he thinks it's our best shot right now to get healthcare costs under control. %$* 462
it's people like mark mcclellan, who hasn said that he believes the affordable care act will start to reduce healthcare spending, and why do we care about mark mcclellan? %$* 462
because mark mcclellan ran medicare in the bush administration, and it’s people like the simpson-bowles commission, the bipartisan fiscal commission said, "the cost control in the affordable care act will be affected, and we need if anything to double down on it." this is not my opinion, it’s not some crazy opinion, it is in fact the opinion of the best experts of left and right. %$* 462
thank you. %$* 462
jonathan cohn, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 462
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, where the motion being argued is "repeal obamacare." now, keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening, because you’re going to be asked to vote again at the conclusion, and i want to remind you that the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, now, on to round two where the debaters can address one another directly, and also take questions from me and you in the audience. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of "abc news." we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
we have two teams of debaters, two against two, who are arguing over this motion, "repeal obamacare." on one side, a former congressman and former aide to john mccain are arguing that the plan passed by the obama administration is going to blow up financially and will hurt america and is headed for the dust bin. %$* 13
arguing against them, a former advisor to the clinton administration and a journalist who has written extensively about healthcare, arguing that this act-- %$* 13
that this law should be preserved, and not only preserved, but built upon. %$* 13
i want to ask a question about philosophy. %$* 13
both sides agree that the system we’ve lived with for the last 30 years, particularly in its last 15 or 20 years, is broken. %$* 13
you agree that something needs to be done. %$* 13
you're arguing over the solutions. %$* 13
your opposition on one side to the president’s program and you’re supporting the other side says what fundamentally about what you think we are as a nation, as americans. %$* 13
i want to put that question first to you, john shadegg, former congressman. %$* 13
i’m thrilled to have that question because i think it’s vitally important. %$* 459
i think we’re already-- %$* 459
we’re a nation that does support taking care of those who can’t care for themselves. %$* 459
we’re a nation-- %$* 459
and my legislation covers every single american-- %$* 459
we’re a nation that thinks it’s outrageous that anybody would lose coverage because there are pre-existing condition like my heart condition or my sister’s breast cancer. %$* 459
but we’re also a nation that honors limited government and honors individual choice. %$* 459
i think on the one hand what you hear from the other side is that the government can manage this issue better. %$* 459

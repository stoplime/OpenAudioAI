but that means china will have to do capitalism. %$* 623
peter schiff. %$* 13
i don’t think he wanted my-- %$* 622
no, you’re here. %$* 13
you’ve got the right. %$* 13
well, i think, ultimately, and this is the bed that i’m making, the chinese are going to make-- %$* 622
the biggest problem that is impeding economic growth in china is their currency peg and the misallocations of resources that are being created in that economy by their desire to prop up the dollar so that american consumers can keep buying chinese products when, in effect, we’re too poor to buy those products because we have nothing to export to pay for them. %$* 622
and i do believe that the chinese are going to see the error of their ways. %$* 622
and when they allow this change to happen, when they allow an appreciation in the value of their currency and they allow their citizens to more fully reap the rewards of their hard work and their savings, i think you’re going to see a much greater growth trajectory in china. %$* 622
and i think a lot of some of the problems that we’re discussing here will go away as the chinese economy is allowed to prosper and the government gets out of the way and lets it happen. %$* 622
right down in front here. %$* 13
my name’s miles london my question has to do with capitalism implies that there is a capital market. %$* 631
the fact that the u.s. and europe for that matter has promoted the idea for the general-- %$* 631
for the better of the general good to haircut bond holders in order to save stock holders, is that driving the u.s. capitalism to be more like the chinese capitalism as has been described? %$* 631
no one’s excited. %$* 13
peter schiff. %$* 13
well, you know, in the original. %$* 622
oh, all right. %$* 13
peter schiff. %$* 13
well, you know, in the original wall street bailouts, it was the stockholders that, in many cases, absorbed the losses. %$* 622
the bond holders got bailed out. %$* 622
but, to your point, in the long run, we are going to wipe out the bondholders, and we’re going to do it through either inflation or default. %$* 622
most likely it will be inflation. %$* 622
i mean, it could be default, but the more likely outcome is that we simply print so much money that the bondholders are deprived of their purchasing power. %$* 622
and that is not a free market. %$* 622
a free market would have sound money. %$* 622
it wouldn’t have the government issuing a currency by fiat and then deciding to punish savers at the expense of debtors, which is going to happen in the united states, especially when you realize that the u.s. government, being the largest debtor of us all, is going to benefit more from inflation than any other debtor. %$* 622
i think there’s a broad question here that is very interesting, the question of is the united states going to have become a little bit more like china in this environment as the global market becomes a little bit less free. %$* 105
and i think that part of the reason i’m skeptical it will happen is because the u.s.government is so badly set up to do it. %$* 105
i mean, i can’t even write an op-ed in the wall street journal and include the words “industrial policy” because it’s just a no-man’s land. %$* 105
nobody wants to talk about it. %$* 105
people in the state department have said, “oh, we can’t talk about industrial policy even though it’s kind of what we’re thinking about.” and so we say economic statecraft. %$* 105
u.s.corporations don’t want to coordinate with their competitors. %$* 105
they don’t want to talk to the u.s.government on this stuff the way that in japan you would if you’re in the keidanren. %$* 105
japan has many-- %$* 105
the ministry of economy of trade and industry. %$* 105
in the united states, we’ve got commerce, which is not exactly where we keep our best bureaucrats. %$* 105
and then we’ve got ustr, which is separate actually and much more capable. %$* 105
you’ve got energy, which is separate. %$* 105
you’ve got the state department which owns a lot of this but has very few people who have the background in the private sector, so the u.s.is very badly set up to do state capitalism, and i think that they won’t. %$* 105
but i do think this is going to become an issue we’re going to debate a lot more in this country. %$* 105
yes, orville. %$* 13
quick comment. %$* 621
you know, i think what ian said is very true. %$* 621
i was recently on the vice president xi's visit. %$* 621
and we went to california, and i was there with governor brown to meet him and meet a bunch of governors. %$* 621
every one of those governors and party secretaries came with 10 guys in black suits, you know, for trade, for energy, for manufacturing. %$* 621
brown had me, you know, a non-paid friend. %$* 621
and it was very evident to me that the state capitalism of china had this incredible sort of plug-in mechanism and we didn’t have a socket. %$* 621
and i think that’s going to have to change if we want to do business with china. %$* 621
these guys wanted to do business. %$* 621
they love california, and they can’t find a way to do it. %$* 621
we need it. %$* 621
okay, we have time for one more question. %$* 13
and last question, sir, blue shirt. %$* 13
my name’s-- %$* 632
hello, my name’s ed saper first of all, thank you all for being here tonight. %$* 632
it’s pretty striking to me we’ve been talking about capitalism, i haven’t really heard much discussion about entrepreneurship. %$* 632
so, i’d be curious to hear from the panelists what’s your view of the link between entrepreneurship and capitalism and which country does it better? %$* 632
orville schell. %$* 13
well, i have to say, i mean, this is something america does exceedingly well. %$* 621
this is the part of american capitalism that really works-- %$* 621
our innovation, our scaling-- %$* 621
our bringing stuff to market, scaling it up, silicon valley. %$* 621
and china does this less well, but i have to say i’ve been around this block for a number of decades. %$* 621
and what i see happening in china is a lot of incredibly interesting self-made entrepreneurs bubbling up from underneath. %$* 621
where they go, where the private sector of the economy goes, can it become the majority sector? %$* 621
that remains to be seen. %$* 621
but this is a very vibrant place. %$* 621
don't write it off for one second. %$* 621
so there is innovation. %$* 13
there is innovation. %$* 13
there is innovation, not full spectrum. %$* 621
they don't have nobel laureates yet at this far end, but there is innovation. %$* 621
these guys are crafty. %$* 621
they are good. %$* 621
they are smart, and boy they're on a roll. %$* 621
entrepreneurship is a-- %$* 622
we think about somebody starting at a high tech company, i mean, an entrepreneur could just be a guy that goes out and, you know, starts a fruit stand or a supermarket. %$* 622
you don't have to be innovative. %$* 622
but what you have to do is be able to take control of people and property and put them together and run a business in a way to generate a profit. %$* 622
and there are a lot of entrepreneurs making a lot of profit in china. %$* 622
they're not, not there. %$* 622
there are a lot of them, and the population of entrepreneurs is growing, and are self-made millionaires in china and more and more of them are being created, and that is going to continue. %$* 622
and that's a function of gaining more freedom and moving away from a centrally planned economy and grabbing more of free market principles. %$* 622
and as i said earlier, i think that as a young person in china wanting to start a small business, whatever it is, i think that young person in china is going to have a better chance of succeeding than his counterpart here. %$* 622
i think there'll be fewer obstacles placed in his path-- %$* 622
okay. %$* 13
by government to that success. %$* 622
okay. %$* 623
minxin pei. %$* 13
i think that young person would be so shocked to hear this because this-- %$* 623
these are the facts, if you are a private entrepreneur in china you cannot go into-- %$* 623
you cannot open a private bank. %$* 623
you cannot get into telecom services. %$* 623
you cannot get into energy. %$* 623
you cannot get international resources. %$* 623
you cannot get into 14 other very important sectors because these are the sectors reserved for state owned companies. %$* 623
you cannot get bank loans. %$* 623
you don't have secure property rights. %$* 623
if you get into a dispute with another entrepreneur, with another businessman, whether you win that dispute does not depend on whether you have a good case, it depends on whether you know the communist party secretary in charge of the legal system. %$* 623
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate because this is their last chance to convince you that they have argued best. %$* 13
and you're going to be asked to vote again once they finish these statements a few minutes from now, and you will pick the winner by doing so. %$* 13
but, first, on to round three, closing statements-- %$* 13
closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is, "china does capitalism better than america." and here to summarize his position against the motion, ian bremmer. %$* 13
he is president of eurasia group and author of the upcoming book, "every nation for itself: winners and losers in a g-zero world." %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 105
my colleague partner, minxin, just talked about all the things you couldn't do to set up in china in terms of entrepreneurship, but he didn't mention fruit stands. %$* 105
you can, and perhaps there's a tunisian model in the future for china. %$* 105
i think it's an interesting question. %$* 105
look, i thought i would end with the future. %$* 105
you know, one of the things the united states does better than anyone else in the world is creative destruction. %$* 105
i like independent bookstores, but i tell you, when amazon came along they got smashed. %$* 105
that may not be a society that you all want to live in. %$* 105
you may like independent bookstores. %$* 105
but it’s a society that does capitalism better. %$* 105
we see that all over the place. %$* 105
creative destruction is what powers the american market. %$* 105
the single biggest game changing innovation in the world today is fracking and unconventional oil, that is changing the nature of global energy, it is overwhelmingly dominated by u.s. universities and research, u.s. entrepreneurs-- %$* 105
a bunch of canadians in there, too, don't want to forget my friends to the north-- %$* 105
and u.s.-based multinational corporations. %$* 105
this matters. %$* 105
i know that the chinese are doing more patents. %$* 105
they're small, they're engineering patents, there's a slight improvements on processes. %$* 105
don't take away from them. %$* 105
they're very smart in china. %$* 105
they're being educated well. %$* 105
they're great. %$* 105
but if you want to talk about the game changing stuff that you want to bet on that's going to make the world work over the next 20 years, overwhelmingly that stuff is being driven in the united states of america. %$* 105
i don't know if it's bill gates's new battery technology that's going to work and be the next game changer, it's going to be in biotech, it's going to be in nanotech, but if you want to make that bet-- %$* 105
and, by the way, the chinese central bank wants to make it, too-- %$* 105
you're going to make it here. %$* 105
i love the fact that we live in a society as well where broad ideologies can come together, work together, and make lots of money. %$* 105
i applaud the fact that we live in a place that a guy like peter schiff can make an enormous coin for himself, and i think you guys should, too. %$* 105
thank you very much. %$* 105
thank you, ian bremmer. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america." and now to summarize his position for the motion, peter schiff. %$* 13
he is ceo and chief global strategist of euro pacific capital. %$* 13
he is also author of the upcoming book, “the real crash: a blueprint for a bankrupt america." peter schiff. %$* 13
rebuilding. %$* 622
i think part of the problem having this debate at this particular point in time, it would kind of be like having a debate in 2005 over which country does real estate better, the united states or china. %$* 622
because in 2005, everybody thought it was great in the u.s.with the housing market. %$* 622
everybody was buying a house, even the people who couldn’t afford them. %$* 622
everybody had second homes and it was great. %$* 622
but of course it was a bubble and it couldn’t last. %$* 622
and that’s the same thing with the u.s.economy. %$* 622
if you want to look at the u.s.economy and measure it by how much money we spend and how much we consume. %$* 622
you look at some of these statistics that you reference about our competitiveness, when the reality is if we’re so competitive, where are all the products and why do we have a huge trade deficit? %$* 622
i think what’s really happening here is we have a bubble in the entire economy and it is based on excess consumption, excess debt. %$* 622
the chinese, they’re not making a big bet on the u.s.treasury market because they want to. %$* 622
it’s because they think they have to. %$* 622
if they can wave a wand and replace all their treasures with gold, they’d do it. %$* 622
the problem is they’re afraid. %$* 622
because they know if they try to sell, they’ll crush the market. %$* 622
but we are on the verge of this collapse. %$* 622
and it’s because we abandoned all the principles of capitalism that we once had. %$* 622
and these are the principles that china is now adopting. %$* 622
as i said earlier, what’s really more important is the pendulum and the direction in which it’s swinging. %$* 622
look at where we started from complete capitalism. %$* 622
and china started, they had none of it. %$* 622
look at how much ground we’ve surrendered and look at how much the chinese have gained. %$* 622
is china perfect? %$* 622
not at all. %$* 622
they still have a lot of progress to make. %$* 622
but they are making that progress. %$* 622
the problem with us is we’re still moving in the wrong direction. %$* 622
and we’re moving in that direction more rapidly. %$* 622
and when we actually have our crisis; when we have a sovereign debt crisis, when the dollar really plunges and we really have to confront the grim reality of our situation, the fact that we’ve been living beyond our means for generations and it has to come to an end, then we can have this debate again. %$* 622
and i think we’ll have a much different reaction in the audience as to how well america does capitalism. %$* 622
thank you peter schiff. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america" and here to summarize his position against the motion, minxin pei. %$* 13
he’s professor of government at claremont mckenna and author of "china’s trapped transition: the limits of developmental autocracy." %$* 13
does china do capitalism better than the u.s.? %$* 623
we have to add one adjective. %$* 623
china does do a certain kind of capitalism better than the u.s.that’s crony capitalism. %$* 623
and i don’t think americans want to excel in that category. %$* 623
because in china, under that kind of capitalism, you are not going to get clean air to breathe. %$* 623
you’re afraid to buy baby formula because if you have babies in the household, you’d better go to hong kong to buy imported baby formula because crony capitalism cannot provide food safety. %$* 623
and if you are part of the elite, crony capitalism serves you really well. %$* 623
because i’ve read that elites in china are now installing air filtering systems in their cars, in their homes. %$* 623
but what about ordinary people? %$* 623
the vision of capitalism peter champions is a vision of 19th century capitalism. %$* 623
thank god america has come a long way and will not go back. %$* 623
let’s also imagine 20 years from now, which system will be there. %$* 623
i can safely bet, 20 years from now, democracy, democratic capitalism will still be around in the u.s. but can you say this about the communist party in china? %$* 623
in the next 20 years with this kind of capitalism? %$* 623
i’m not so sure. %$* 623
my bet is that it will not be there. %$* 623
so at the end of the day, it will be american capitalism that triumphs over crony capitalism. %$* 623
thank you minxin pei. %$* 13
this is our motion, "china does capitalism better than america." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, orville schell, an award-winning journalist and director of asia society’s center on u.s., china relations. %$* 13
well minxin, amen. %$* 621
i really want to agree with you and i truly hope you’re right. %$* 621
it would be nice. %$* 621
but who would have thought five or 10 years ago, that we would be sitting here tonight even having this debate, that there would be any kind of equilibrium even to discuss between these two great economic systems. %$* 621
no one. %$* 621
twenty years ago, impossible. %$* 621
thirty years ago when i first went to china, it was unthinkable. %$* 621
china is undeniably in transition. %$* 621
we are a more finished product trying to regain our balance. %$* 621
and i worry about the united states. %$* 621
i think we have a good model, but i think we haven’t played it very well. %$* 621
i think we’ve deceived ourselves. %$* 621
i think we’ve fallen into a lot of self deception about what has made this country great and strong. %$* 621
it’s a combination between regulation and control and wisdom at the top setting an equitable and fair system and a free market with a vibrant set of entrepreneurs and innovators at the bottom. %$* 621
china is still trying to find its balance between these things. %$* 621
i don’t know where they’re going to go. %$* 621
i don’t know how it’s going to end up. %$* 621
i can’t see the future for us or them, but i can see the last five or 10 years. %$* 621
and i think everyone in this room should acknowledge that despite all its imperfections, despite the human rights questions, despite all of these other things, that what china has accomplished, as counterintuitive as it was, no one could have predicted it, is pretty extraordinary. %$* 621
something has been working pretty well. %$* 621
we don’t know where it’s going to go in the future, and all we can do is sit and wait. %$* 621
but if we want to fix something, we’re not going to fix china. %$* 621
the question is are we going to fix ourselves. %$* 621
thank you, orville schell. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side our live audience feels has argued best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we’re going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america.” if you feel the side arguing for this motion, this side argued best, press number one. %$* 13
if you feel this side, press number two. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we’ll lock out the votes almost instantly. %$* 13
and while we’re waiting for them, i’m going to just do a little bit of housekeeping. %$* 13
first of all, peter, did i get the name of your book wrong. %$* 13
did i-- %$* 13
i said “the real crash: a blueprint for a bankrupt america”-- %$* 13
“rebuilding a bankrupt america.” %$* 622
all right, that’s a very important missing word. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
i do want to try to rebuild it. %$* 622
no, no. %$* 13
i’m working on a book, and if like this, somebody got the name wrong, i would want to shoot myself. %$* 13
so, i want to-- %$* 13
i’m going to read-- %$* 13
actually, it’s the real-- %$* 622
america is-- %$* 622
no, actually, that’s not even it. %$* 622
it’s “the real crash: america’s coming bankruptcy. %$* 622
how to save yourself and your country.” that’s the title. %$* 622
well. %$* 13
really, that’s the title? %$* 13
yeah, that is it. %$* 622
yeah. %$* 622
because i would really like to say it correctly so that we can edit this for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
yeah, that was an old working title, which got changed. %$* 622
so the title that is actually on the book, that will be on the bookstands in may is “the real crash”-- %$* 622
“the real crash,” right, yeah. %$* 13
i want to say this-- %$* 13
“america’s coming bankruptcy. %$* 622
how to save yourself and your country.” %$* 622
all right. %$* 13
i’m pretty sure that’s it. %$* 622
i hope so, because i’m trying to memorize it. %$* 13
“the real crash: america’s coming bankruptcy and how to-- %$* 13
“save yourself and your country.” %$* 622
“and your country.” all right. %$* 13
peter schiff, ceo and chief global strategist of euro- pacific capital and author of the upcoming book, “the real crash: something really bad, something terrible.” i’m sorry. %$* 13
we’re going to have to edit around it. %$* 13
the title’s not even finished at this point. %$* 13
no, it’s finished. %$* 622
it’s-- %$* 622
“the real crash: america’s coming bankruptcy. %$* 622
how to save yourself and your country.” %$* 622
all right. %$* 13
yes. %$* 622
you can buy it on amazon since you like it so much. %$* 622
you can preorder it. %$* 622
our next debate is coming up on april 17th, and here is our motion: “when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.”speaking for the motion, we’ll have eli pariser. %$* 13
he is a pioneering online organizer and board president of moveon.org. %$* 13
his book, “the filter bubble,” three words, was the-- %$* 13
so easy, so easy-- %$* 13
was the inspiration for this debate. %$* 13
his partner booked is lawrence lessig, a law professor at harvard and one of the country’s preeminent legal scholars. %$* 13
he’s been called the philosopher king of internet law by the new york times and the elvis of cyber law by wired magazine. %$* 13
against the motion, we’re going to have evgeny morozov who is a journalist and author of “the net delusion.” he bemoans what he calls slacktivism, which is defined by him as the tendency of the internet to distract the population from any type of serious political engagement. %$* 13
and his partner, jacob weisberg, who first joined the online magazine slate back in 1996-- %$* 13
that’s when people were just figuring out what the internet was. %$* 13
and today he is the chairman and editor-in-chief of the slate group. %$* 13
i also want to say that we-- %$* 13
i think all of us with intelligence squared are delighted by the spirit with which this panel came to this debate tonight, the level of arguments, the fact that you stuck to ideas, that it didn’t get nasty or personal but was thoughtful and provocative. %$* 13
i want to thank you for the way that you’ve conducted yourselves during this debate. %$* 13
and also, to the audience questions that were on point and really did help move this debate along, thank you to all of you who stood up and asked questions. %$* 13
okay, and so i now have the results. %$* 13
it’s all in. %$* 13
we have asked you to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
this is the final result on who wins this argument according to our live audience here. %$* 13
our motion is "china does capitalism better than america.”before the debate, 17 percent of you were in favor of the motion, 50 percent against, and 33 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 9 percent are for the motion-- %$* 13
that’s down 8 percent-- %$* 13
85 percent support the motion-- %$* 13
that’s up 35 percent-- %$* 13
6 percent are undecided. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, "china does capitalism better than america,” wins this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we will see you next time. %$* 13

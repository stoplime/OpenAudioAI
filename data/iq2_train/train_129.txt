the other thing that i want to say about your discussion of the boundaries of the battlefield, or what constitutes a battlefield, the threshold of violence discussion that she mentions is from the tadicopinion from the icty (international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia). and that applies to internal armed conflicts, right? %$* 379
this is not dealing with a conflict between a nonstate actor that crosses international boundaries. %$* 379
that was from the yugoslav war, right? %$* 379
if we are talking about the boundaries of battlefields between two nations, world war ii did span the entire globe. %$* 379
americans killed japanese and germans in the south atlantic and in china and in burma and off australia. %$* 379
all over the world, those things were going on. %$* 379
and more importantly, if we're talking about what other nations do, other nations facing nonstate actors do not allow them to have a sanctuary, which is what they are saying they should get, by going across international boundary. %$* 379
you get to yemen, you get to somalia, you get to sudan, and you're safe. %$* 379
you are immune from attack just because you got to a certain place, and then you can rearm, refit and reattack. %$* 379
the laws of war do not work that way. %$* 379
noah feldman. %$* 13
i just want to clearly refute the point that somehow the battlefield is anywhere where we can't arrest somebody. %$* 380
first of all, we could we could arrest the people in lots of these countries, yemen and pakistan included. %$* 380
and if you want proof of that, it's that those governments actually agreed to our drone strikes. %$* 380
the obama administration's official position is we don't do drone strikes in a country without the permission of that country. %$* 380
you know why? %$* 380
because otherwise it would be an act of war against that country. %$* 380
so we get permission, and we got permission in all of these cases. %$* 380
so if you can get permission from a country, you can get help from that country. %$* 380
and, in principle, arrests would be possible. %$* 380
want to add one more point. %$* 380
if you think that anywhere in the world counts as the battlefield, then even though our motion talks about abroad, if you vote, "yes," on this motion, "yes, the president can do this abroad," it follows logically that the president could do it within the united states. %$* 380
let me stop you there because i think i want to hear the other side respond to that point. %$* 13
alan dershowitz, is that-- %$* 13
does that frighten you, that thought? %$* 13
no. %$* 305
i-- %$* 305
what frightens me is the idea that a law professor would be telling the president that it's possible to arrest known terrorists-- %$* 305
but, alan, that's a little bit of a subject change because i really want to hear an answer to the question, would this-- %$* 13
would the logical conclusion of your argument be that the president could use and execute this power inside the borders of the united states against a perceived enemy? %$* 13
well, the president already-- %$* 305
i mean, the executive already has that power as i proved in my opening-- %$* 305
no-- %$* 305
let me answer the question the way i want to answer it-- %$* 305
the executive already has the power to kill americans if they are fleeing felons if they are holding hostages. %$* 305
if we had a situation where al-qaeda established a base in the smoky mountains from which they were sending rockets to philadelphia and we couldn't arrest them because they-- %$* 305
the geographical situation was difficult and it would require the sacrifice of 10 or 20 or 30 american soldiers to arrest them, the answer to the question would be, "yes.” we could use a sniper, as we have in the past. %$* 305
we could use a drone. %$* 305
we could use any modern technology to kill an american citizen who was endangering american citizens imminently by having a base firing rockets. %$* 305
yes, the answer to that question is, "yes.” now, it's not, "yes," in the sense of the same response that would occur to somebody who was abroad. %$* 305
the criteria would be different, but the power already exists. %$* 305
and there's no doubt about that. %$* 305
and, noah, how would you respond to "what is the difference between a terrorist holding hostages in the united states and the only alternative is to let him continue to hold the hostage, you can't arrest him, but you could kill him by a sniper or a drone, would you deny the executive the power to do that? %$* 305
let's let hina answer that question, hina shamsi. %$* 13
so the answer to that is that no one questions seriously that the police forces, military have the ability to use lethal force in response to an imminent threat. %$* 381
what we're talking about is what the president's authority as he claims it today is. %$* 381
and that authority is very distinct from what we've been talking about. %$* 381
it is based on a global battlefield, and it is based on a definition of imminence that does violence to life, to the rule of law, and to language itself because it radically reinterprets it. %$* 381
that's really at the heart of what this debate is. %$* 381
and one of the key points that we keep going back and forth on is there's no question that it-- %$* 381
perhaps it sounds like you would agree that judicial review is needed. %$* 381
we can see if you agree with that or not. %$* 381
it's a very hard thing to talk about what kind of judicial review, right, because if you're using the law as it applies, if lethal force is used in response to an imminent threat, then by definition you won't have judicial review in advance. %$* 381
that's understandable. %$* 381
but if you're using imminence as the administration defines it, with apparently people being placed on kill lists for years, then the argument against judicial review falls away as does the legal justification. %$* 381
what's most troublesome right now about the government's position and what it argues in court is that the courts have no role to play, none at all. %$* 381
let me interrupt you and bring in michael lewis to respond to that. %$* 13
does that-- %$* 13
is that troubling or not, that the courts have no role to play, because your partner was saying that it's kind of ridiculous, the idea that a judge who doesn't know very much about war would be brought into this process? %$* 13
no, the courts do not have a role if we are talking about war. %$* 379
and we are not here defending the white paper, right? %$* 379
we are here supporting the motion. %$* 379
the government's stance on the white paper and the discussion of imminence is not necessarily the standard that we are asked to meet today. %$* 379
what we are trying to say-- %$* 379
if you're talking about wartime, there is no imminence. %$* 379
you are allowed to kill an enemy during wartime whether they are armed, whether they are awake, right? %$* 379
you are allowed to kill enemy-- %$* 379
positively identified enemy soldiers in wartime-- %$* 379
at any time, right? %$* 379
that doesn't require a showing of imminence. %$* 379
and the question is, are we at war with al-qaeda? %$* 379
were we at war with the confederacy when we killed a whole lot of americans based upon their status? %$* 379
so, you're saying the imminence question is actually irrelevant-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 379
if we're talking about war. %$* 379
noah feldman. %$* 13
there was a wonderful moment where i was going to invite michael over to the side of the good. %$* 380
but then i realized he was going in the other direction. %$* 380
imminence-- %$* 380
for everyone-- %$* 13
for everyone-- %$* 13
you defined the word very nicely, but let's take the latin out of it and-- %$* 13
imminence means "it's about to happen right now." %$* 13
imminence means, "it's about to happen right now.” it has a meaning in international law. %$* 380
it has a meaning in american domestic law. %$* 380
and it has a meaning in english. %$* 380
if you have time to leak to the papers, over the space of week, that you think you're possibly considering killing a guy-- %$* 380
which some of you may have noticed in the papers, the administration has been doing over the last couple of weeks, with an american, who we know by the name abdullah al-shami. %$* 380
i don't know his actual name. %$* 380
that's not imminent. %$* 380
but i just want to point out-- %$* 380
but they're saying it doesn't matter. %$* 13
right. %$* 380
michael is now saying-- %$* 380
which i haven't heard alan say-- %$* 380
but michael has said now, "imminence doesn't matter.” we can kill an american citizen abroad any time we feel like it if he's affiliated with al-qaeda, based on a decision made by the president in secret. %$* 380
okay. %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
that's your view-- %$* 13
are you saying-- %$* 13
is that your view? %$* 13
that's, like, a great thing for us if-- %$* 380
you don't-- %$* 380
you can see that-- %$* 13
but is that your view? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 379
michael lewis first. %$* 13
is he-- %$* 13
is he paraphrasing you accurately? %$* 13
if they are a positively identified enemy-- %$* 379
member of al-qaeda or associated forces-- %$* 379
and an operational role, right? %$* 379
that's another requirement we've placed upon ourselves. %$* 379
if they are doing that, then we don't have to wait for them to be on the phone, about to order the attack, because we may not see them when they're on the phone ordering the attack. %$* 379
we may only see him-- %$* 379
we only may have a shot at him when he's sleeping. %$* 379
and i do want to say one other quick thing about pakistan and law enforcement. %$* 379
can you-- %$* 13
just-- %$* 13
can you hang onto that? %$* 13
yeah, okay. %$* 379
because i really alan dershowitz. %$* 13
i think you are prepared to concede that. %$* 305
i mean, if you have osama bin laden, who is planning these things long-term, and you can find him-- %$* 305
let's assume, on a hot battlefield-- %$* 305
then surely you don't require imminence either. %$* 305
you require-- %$* 305
you define imminence functionally as well. %$* 305
and the question i want to throw back at you is-- %$* 305
let's go back to my terrorist holding hostage in the united states, in a place where he can't be arrested. %$* 305
he's holding 24 children. %$* 305
he's not imminently going to kill them. %$* 305
he wants to negotiate over days and over weeks, but you now have a shot at killing him and eliminating all risk to the children with no risk to anyone else. %$* 305
would you suggest that you have to get a warrant in order to kill that terrorist? %$* 305
of course not. %$* 305
so-- %$* 305
well, actually-- %$* 13
before-- %$* 13
let-- %$* 13
don't make it just rhetorical. %$* 13
let's hear their answer to that. %$* 13
the terrorist with the gun to the head of the child-- %$* 380
that is the definition of imminence. %$* 380
there's a little picture of that in the-- %$* 380
that’s imminence-- %$* 380
no, no, no, no. %$* 13
but alan-- %$* 13
alan said the guy wants 48 hours to talk-- %$* 13
he wants-- %$* 380
and you have your shot now. %$* 13
he wants 48-- %$* 380
and he wants a week. %$* 380
that's-- %$* 380
and that's a valid-- %$* 13
that's a valid enough framing. %$* 13
i think the view of the terrorist who says, "you’ve got 48 hours. %$* 380
and if you walk in the door, i'm going to kill the person right now.” otherwise, you would just walk in the door-- %$* 380
so, it's not 48 hours then. %$* 380
isn't the al-qaeda guy saying, "as soon as we have an opportunity to put a bomb on a plane and a guy wearing a shoe or a guy wearing the underwear, we're going to do it"? %$* 305
it could be tomorrow. %$* 305
why is that not a gun to the head-- %$* 305
that's a-- %$* 380
to all of us? %$* 305
that's actually not the position that the white paper takes. %$* 380
what it says is-- %$* 380
well, we're not defending the white paper. %$* 305
we're defending the power of the president-- %$* 305
well, you're putting two opposite views, now, of imminence. %$* 380
you're saying imminence is pretty darn imminent, which i'm actually prepared to think is-- %$* 380
no. %$* 305
reasonable. %$* 380
no, no. %$* 305
i'm-- %$* 305
and michael is saying imminence is not relevant. %$* 380
i'm saying it's a functional definition. %$* 305
you have to ask yourself, "what is the opportunity to prevent an event which is highly likely? %$* 305
we don't know exactly when it's going to occur, but we have an opportunity to prevent it now. %$* 305
we may lose that opportunity tomorrow.” so, imminence may not define the harm. %$* 305
it may harm the opportunity to prevent the harm. %$* 305
if it's highly likely to occur in the immediate future, i think that's imminent. %$* 380
no, not in the immediate future. %$* 305
what if it's-- %$* 305
i mean, imminent future. %$* 380
that's-- %$* 380
in the longer term? %$* 305
using-- %$* 380
i'm trying not to use the-- %$* 380
all right. %$* 13
word imminent. %$* 380
i want to go some questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
and you sort of see the spirit of this. %$* 13
we'd like you to be-- %$* 13
raise your hand, stand up. %$* 13
really tight, focused question that keeps these debaters focused on this motion. %$* 13
sir, right down front here. %$* 13
and a microphone will come to you from your left side. %$* 13
and if you can just wait for it. %$* 13
and if you can bring the mike to about this distance from your mouth, so i have-- %$* 13
the radio broadcast will hear you out. %$* 13
now, tell us your name as well, please. %$* 13
when you mentioned that the-- %$* 382
can you tell us your name? %$* 13
fathers-- %$* 382
sir, can you tell us your name? %$* 13
and your mike is not on yet. %$* 13
my name is jerry volk and i'm a philadelphian. %$* 382
and when you mentioned that the founding fathers would not have tolerated this, i think back to when washington crossed the delaware and chased the hessians-- %$* 382
in new jersey, down the pike. %$* 382
what about that civilian who was in a house overlooking the route where the troops marched and the hessians marched, and that civilian who had a hand grenade in his pocket, was killing him justified in your opinion? %$* 382
i don't follow the question. %$* 13
do you? %$* 13
are you better than me at this? %$* 13
because i-- %$* 13
i just want to-- %$* 13
the anachronism of the hand grenade at valley forge is confusing me. %$* 13
so i'm not sure where you're-- %$* 13
valley forge yet but-- %$* 382
okay. %$* 13
the question, in my mind, and the founding fathers, deals with the issue of imminence and what that person with a hand grenade in his pocket may do to the combatants who are passing by. %$* 382
do they have a right to act first or wait until they get blown up by the hand grenade? %$* 382
if i understand your question, it's one that is based on the existence of an actual war and an armed conflict and the participation of a civilian in that armed conflict. %$* 381
and the law actually does permit lethal force to be used against civilians who are at or on the battlefield and directly participating in hostilities. %$* 381
there's no question about that. %$* 381
the difficulty we're having here now, that you're hearing this evening, is that our opponents want the battlefield to be designed so broadly that there is no limit to it, that the limits that international law has always recognized that have helped us contain when the government can use the broadest authority that it may have to kill no longer apply. %$* 381
and that is %$* 381
is there a very common sense-- %$* 13
a very common sense notion to their claim that the-- %$* 13
that a battlefield is everywhere. %$* 13
and in his opening statement, alan said basically this is common sense. %$* 13
and you are talking about international law as it exists and saying that it doesn't fit the scenario. %$* 13
and they are saying, well, in a common sense way, the war is everywhere. %$* 13
now, i think we all understand what they mean by that. %$* 13
and i'd like to hear more of a challenge to it. %$* 13
by the way, we're not saying everywhere. %$* 305
we're saying everywhere-- %$* 305
where they are. %$* 13
where they are and have sanctuary and can't be reasonably arrested. %$* 305
right. %$* 13
not heathrow airport. %$* 305
so i-- %$* 13
the common sense side of that argument is appealing to the intellect. %$* 13
i want to see if there's a response to it. %$* 13
either of you-- %$* 13
either of you would take that. %$* 13
sure. %$* 381
let me-- %$* 381
hina shamsi. %$* 13
just start, and perhaps noah will jump in. %$* 381
you know, what they're positing is common sense is actually far from that. %$* 381
and listen to the language that they're using, "everywhere where they are.” who is "they"? %$* 381
the government is telling us, president obama has said that core al-qaeda has been decimated. %$* 381
so now we're talking about associated forces. %$* 381
who are associated forces? %$* 381
the government refuses to define them. %$* 381
it refuses to tell us who they are. %$* 381
part of the core of what we look to in a democracy is when we go to war, we need to know where we're at war at. %$* 381
and we absolutely don't know that right now. %$* 381
and the kinds of thresholds for war to exist, the kinds of powers that the president can claim in war time to exist, simply are not there. %$* 381
and michael lewis, you-- %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
in fact your opponents, in making that point earlier, also said that's a very big mistake to go into the whole notion of "trust us.” you know, give the executive a "trust us" pass, and that that's-- %$* 13
history shows we don't want to do that. %$* 13
and it sounds as though you're being accused of doing that. %$* 13
but i don't think-- %$* 379
well, first of all, when you talk about-- %$* 379
it's not the executive that is saying we are at war. %$* 379
it is congress that is saying we are at war, and it's their job so say so. %$* 379
and al-qaeda and associated forces, who are they? %$* 379
but in the operational sense, in the executive sense. %$* 13
in the operational sense, then you're talking about al-qaeda, al-qaeda-- %$* 379
i'm talking about the white house is saying, "trust us," in the operational sense. %$* 13
so they are saying that if we are going to-- %$* 379
we cannot distribute in detail how we are determining who the enemy is because if we describe in detail who the enemy is, then they will make sure that they are not that, right? %$* 379
if you think about rico laws, rico laws are developed to deal with the mafia because the individuals in the mafia knew what they could say or not say, and therefore not be guilty or not be close enough to the crime. %$* 379
same thing here. %$* 379
if we say, what you need to be to be on our list is you have to be doing a, b and c. %$* 379
but does that mean they're right, that it is a "trust us" situation? %$* 13
at some level, you always have to trust the executive because it's the executive that is given the authority to do this. %$* 379
but also, every single act of targeted assassination is then reported to the house and senate intelligence committee. %$* 305
there is review. %$* 305
and by the way, i'm not opposed to after the fact judicial review. %$* 305
virtually every exercise of legitimate presidential power is subject to judicial review. %$* 305
there is no inconsistency between saying the president has the power, which is our proposition, and them saying, but if he violates that power or abuses it, you can take him to court under judicial review. %$* 305
we don't oppose that. %$* 305
what we oppose is having the judiciary or the senate or house, that would be a bill of attainder, but the judiciary in advance saying, well, maybe this guy you can kill, this guy you can't kill, when the president and the intelligence community have information that they cannot disclose. %$* 305
and one more point that i have to make is that you're so solicitous about al-qaeda members. %$* 305
about 600 americans are killed every year by police in the course of arresting fleeing felons. %$* 305
we do that without judicial review. %$* 305
the supreme court in the case of gardner vs. %$* 305
tennessee has said if there is any possibility that the person is dangerous and might commit a crime in the future, if the alternative is to let him escape or not let him escape, you can shoot him dead. %$* 305
how do you distinguish that %$* 305
noah feldman. %$* 13
i just want to be really clear that what we're debating-- %$* 380
and this is an answer to that. %$* 380
what we're debating here is the president's power under the constitution, what he's really authorized to do constitutionally. %$* 380
the president is authorized. %$* 380
the police are authorized to use deadly force in a situation of true imminence. %$* 380
absent imminence, the president is not authorized. %$* 380
and what we're talking about here in the real world, and we're talking about a real world case, is where there is no imminence in the ordinary sense of the term. %$* 380
imminence of what? %$* 305
when the fleeing felon is imminence of escape, not imminence of committing another crime. %$* 305
that's just wrong. %$* 380
alan, i just want-- %$* 13
i just want to-- %$* 13
noah, you have the floor for the next minute. %$* 13
gardner vs. %$* 305
tennessee-- %$* 305
let him have the floor for the next minute because i've given this side a bit of a long run. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
noah feldman. %$* 13
the purpose of using deadly force against a fleeing felon, its fundamental purpose is to protect the public. %$* 380
it's not to punish the person. %$* 380
of course to protect the public. %$* 305
so is-- %$* 305
come on. %$* 13
come on, alan. %$* 13
alan. %$* 13
protect the public. %$* 305
and where there is true imminence, the court has held that the executive can do that, and that makes a lot of sense. %$* 380
imminence or not-- %$* 305
alan, i-- %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to give you-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 305
i'm going to give you a response time, but i'm about to take it away. %$* 13
go ahead, noah. %$* 13
as i've said i don't know how many times now, imminence of immediate deadly harm, that's the standard, that's the reasonable standard. %$* 380
it makes sense in the war context. %$* 380
it makes sense in the police context. %$* 380
it does not make sense when the administration has time to run it up the flag pole and see who salutes. %$* 380
yeah, you know, that's-- %$* 13
that is common sense from this side now in terms-- %$* 13
imminence means right-- %$* 13
you know, imminence means it's going to happen today. %$* 13
no. %$* 305
and the guy's on the plane, right? %$* 13
well, the question is-- %$* 305
no? %$* 13
imminence of what? %$* 305
now, let me be very clear. %$* 305
let me put on my hat as a law professor who has been teaching tennessee vs. %$* 305
gardner for the last 25 years. %$* 305
the law is completely clear that the person does not have to be imminently planning another crime. %$* 305
the imminent is he will escape unless he's shot dead. %$* 305
the only alternatives are shooting him dead or letting him escape. %$* 305
he's committed a past crime. %$* 305
he may commit a future crime. %$* 305
so the supreme court, for american citizens, has already defined imminence functionally. %$* 305
if this is your last opportunity to arrest him, and he will otherwise escape, you may shoot him dead. %$* 305
so noah, you're just wrong when you say that the imminence requirement always modifies the imminence of the ultimate harm. %$* 305
sometimes it modifies the imminence of the escape. %$* 305
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared-- %$* 13
i have to do this for radio, and i need you to not be chuckling. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
and we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: the president has constitutional power to target and kill u.s.citizens abroad. %$* 13
we're taking audience questions. %$* 13
and the gentleman has been very patient. %$* 13
i hope-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i promised with the visual eye thing your neighbor. %$* 13
so i'll come to you next, but i hope it's a great question. %$* 13
daniel berger from philadelphia. %$* 383
let's try to cut through all the sophistry. %$* 383
this is a question to both sides, to each participant. %$* 383
aren't you really saying the president has the power, it's just not absolute? %$* 383
hina, do you want to take that first? %$* 13
yes. %$* 381
that’s i think what i started off saying in the first two minutes of when i started talking, and i think that that is correct. %$* 381
what we're talking about here is the power that the president is claiming today that goes beyond what the constitution and international law permits. %$* 381
no one seriously questions that the president has the power to order the killing of people, citizen and noncitizen alike, when they are on an actual battlefield. %$* 381
those are the battlefield rules under certain constraints. %$* 381
no one's questioning that lethal force may be used in response to an imminent threat. %$* 381
and one point here, the thing about fleeing felons is they're felons. %$* 381
they've been found guilty-- %$* 381
oh, no, no-- %$* 305
after charge or trial. %$* 381
and one of the core things-- %$* 381
no, you're missing my point. %$* 305
they have just committed a crime. %$* 305
the policeman thinks he's a fleeing felon. %$* 305
it may be a movie. %$* 305
he may have wondered onto a movie set. %$* 305
but if he reasonably believes that there's been no trial, that's my point. %$* 305
okay, all right, hina. %$* 13
so let me-- %$* 381
now you get an extra 30 seconds. %$* 13
enjoy it. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 381
so the answer is that we're not being absolute. %$* 381
we're talking about what is going on today and why that is impermissible, why that goes beyond the boundaries of anything permitted by law. %$* 381
okay, and this side want to take that question as well? %$* 13
mike lewis? %$* 13
i have a feeling you agree that nothing is absolute. %$* 13
no, nothing, nothing is absolute, but i think it-- %$* 379
there's no question the president has this power and he has this power and the constitution has set up how he gets that power-- %$* 379
it's not up to him to get it, it's up to congress to give it to him in the course of a war. %$* 379
and i think one of the big disagreements we have here is where is a battlefield? %$* 379
and one thing that i heard them say earlier and that i want to come back to really quickly now is law enforcement. %$* 379
let's have law enforcement in pakistan, all right? %$* 379
let's have law enforcement in the fata region of pakistan. %$* 379
there are no police in the fata region of pakistan. %$* 379
that is not how it's constructed. %$* 379
the pakistani constitution does not apply in the fata region of pakistan. %$* 379
this is not how-- %$* 379
so you can't say, "well, pakistan can enforce the law there.” no, it can't, right, under its constitution, the way this works is you have an agent from islamabad that goes up and deals with local tribal disputes, and those are enforced by tribal militias. %$* 379
there are no police in fata-- %$* 379
and your point being? %$* 13
and there is no law enforcement in fata. %$* 379
your point-- %$* 13
so for them to be saying that we should rely on law enforcement to capture people in the fata region of pakistan is ridiculous because it doesn't exist. %$* 379
sir. %$* 13
mr. %$* 384
feldman, you had mentioned-- %$* 384
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
huh? %$* 384
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
oh, len galeman i'm from philadelphia. %$* 384
and, mr. %$* 384
feldman, you had mentioned-- %$* 384
you had made a reference to "when does the war end? %$* 384
does the war end when the president says it ends? %$* 384
" but the fact of the matter is we're dealing with al- qaeda, we're dealing with radical islam and other forms of radical islam, and they say the war will never end because they feel that we are the infidels. %$* 384
so let me ask you something, do you really feel that the end of the war is in america's hands, or is it in the radical islam's hands? %$* 384
i deeply appreciate mr. %$* 380
galeman-- %$* 380
is that your name-- %$* 380
yeah. %$* 384
mr. %$* 380
galeman 's question because i think it really captures the tremendous danger of the position that the other side is arguing for and that the administration has adopted. %$* 380
the united states is not at war with radical islam or even with jihadi islam as a matter of law or as a matter of policy, okay? %$* 380
that's not the state of play. %$* 380
congress did not declare war on all muslims. %$* 380
i think-- %$* 380
it did not declare war on all radical muslims. %$* 380
it did not declare war on all jihadi muslims. %$* 380
it declared war on al-qaeda and forces who are fighting with al-qaeda. %$* 380
now, there is a natural human tendency, and i sometimes share it myself, to think, "look, one radical jihadi group is a lot like another. %$* 380
they're all kind of similar.” and, in fact, in the world of al-qaeda, where there's no formal organizational method, you can just start your own jihadi organization, and you can call yourself "al- qaeda," and there's no one there to stop you. %$* 380
we've actually seen versions of this happening in syria recently. %$* 380
on the view that the united states can indefinitely fight wars against anybody who dresses himself or herself up in the guise of al-qaeda, there really will be no end to this. %$* 380
we will really be in a situation where wherever the president wants to kill someone, anywhere in the world, who happens not to like us very much, it will fall arguably within this same degree of authority. %$* 380
and that's what the problem is. %$* 380
i just want to close by saying-- %$* 380
to that point by saying that we are all busy people, and you didn't come here to listen to a debate about an abstract topic. %$* 380
we're debating a real topic in the real world, and that's what we're debating is what the actual government of the united states is actually doing and its real world policies. %$* 380
that's what's on the table. %$* 380
okay, i'd like to-- %$* 13
are there any women raising their hands? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, mary beth from new jersey, my question is at what point does a u.s. citizen lose the right to due process? %$* 385
let's put that first to this side who has actually made that point in some detail but to take the opportunity to elaborate. %$* 13
and either of you can take it, michael lewis or alan dershowitz. %$* 13
michael lewis. %$* 13
i think the answer to that is when they become an operational member of al-qaeda. %$* 379
an operational member means you are not just proselytizing, you are not just giving people religious reasons for liking islam or hating america. %$* 379
you can say, "i hate america" all you want. %$* 379
but when you become an operational member, that means you are making bombs. %$* 379
you are planning attacks. %$* 379
you are carrying out attacks. %$* 379
you are conducting weapons training. %$* 379
you are training others. %$* 379
and you are directing them how to make suicide bets and conduct suicide attacks. %$* 379
how do you build a car bomb, how do you drive a car with 500 pounds of explosives in it effectively. %$* 379
you learn those things, you teach others those things, you are an operational member of al-qaeda. %$* 379
and so, this is not a surprise. %$* 379
you don't get off the plane at heathrow airport. %$* 379
"oh, i'm suddenly targetable.” no, you are doing these things. %$* 379
and it's not a surprise to either anwar al- awlaki or al-shami-- %$* 379
who is designing ieds in pakistan-- %$* 379

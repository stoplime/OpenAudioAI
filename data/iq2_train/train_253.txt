if you want to undermine them this is one of the ways to do it. %$* 667
what you're talking about is radio‐free europe, voice of america updated to 2015. %$* 667
michèle flournoy. %$* 13
the administration, the obama administration, has very successfully put together a 60‐ nation coalition, but what we haven't yet achieved is a coherent strategy where everybody's pulling in the right direction, the same direction. %$* 664
one of the things that our partners need to be convinced of is the degree of u.s.commitment. %$* 664
i think if the u.s.shows that commitment we have a lot of leverage to get others to be using the money they're already putting in to this theater in a much more productive and effective manner. %$* 664
so, we're not going to be funding this alone. %$* 664
we have 60 nations signed up to help. %$* 664
what we have to do is use our commitment to better leverage and focus-- %$* 664
to better focus the efforts of the whole coalition, and we have not done that. %$* 664
with respect, you earlier said we don’t want to rely on the saudis. %$* 667
we want to rely on the locals. %$* 667
no, i said i don't want to have saudi forces coming into iraq and syria. %$* 664
okay. %$* 667
well, our-- %$* 667
that's different than asking the saudis to help fund a proper strategy that we have helped to put together. %$* 664
but part of our-- %$* 667
is our coalition only for funding? %$* 667
is that what we're doing here? %$* 667
no. %$* 664
of course not. %$* 664
there are other things as well, but do you think-- %$* 664
well, what are those other things? %$* 667
it's a smart idea to put saudi forces in iraq and syria? %$* 664
i don't. %$* 664
i'm not the one suggesting it. %$* 667
you're the one suggesting it. %$* 667
no i didn't suggest it. %$* 664
you put words in my mouth. %$* 664
all i'm saying is you said that it's the local forces and now you've got a 60‐nation-- %$* 667
local syrian and iraqi forces fighting-- %$* 664
right, and now you're talking about a coalition that's doing what? %$* 667
i want to saying something. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
i answered the question. %$* 667
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters. %$* 13
two teams of two debating this motion: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
let's go to another question, sir. %$* 13
i am david petraeus and i-- %$* 669
and i rise to take slight issue and ask a question of my friend, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 669
anne‐marie, you stated that the surge didn't work. %$* 669
with great respect, i was there and actually-- %$* 669
actually it worked pretty extraordinarily. %$* 669
i mean, driving violence down by 85 to 95 percent. %$* 669
phil remembers. %$* 669
he was in the administration. %$* 669
we achieved all the objectives. %$* 669
by the way, ambassador crocker is back here, for whom i was privileged to be the wingman as he pursued the diplomatic efforts. %$* 669
the results were sustained, in fact, for three and a half years after the drawdown of the surge forces until prime minister malaki undid them and all that we and iraqi forces achieved, and he alienated the sunnis. %$* 669
so, the point here is that he undid the political bargain that was reached during the surge. %$* 669
the further point is that the center of gravity of the fight against isis is not in the frontlines it's in baghdad in iraqi politics and indeed in various syrian locations-- %$* 669
wait. %$* 13
i have to stop you. %$* 13
i'm giving you a lot of leeway because of your service, but ultimately democratically i need to ask you to ask a question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 669
pop it. %$* 13
the question. %$* 669
can you be confident, anne‐marie, that allowing isis to continue to control large areas of syria, i.e., just containing them, and iraq, can allow the new political discussions that are so important in ensuring multi‐sectarian and multi‐ethnic populations that they can enter into the new bargains in the shadow of areas from which contained, but undefeated isis extremists will continue to project violence seeking to spread the horrific humanitarian situation and geopolitical chernobyl that is ‐ ‐ syria. %$* 669
dave. %$* 666
so, general petraeus, even-- %$* 666
so, general petraeus, even though we are both proud graduates of the woodrow wilson school, i could not quite keep all of that in my head at one moment, but what i will say is i did not say that the surge was not successful. %$* 666
the surge was successful and-- %$* 666
no, i did not. %$* 666
i said it was-- %$* 666
i-- %$* 13
again, i don't want the audience debating with the debaters, so the floor is yours. %$* 13
it was absolutely successful and then you left and then we left and then the iraqis did not do what they should be doing to liberate their own country on their own and we are back here again. %$* 666
as you said from the stage, i was there. %$* 666
we liberated mosul, but mosul is now once again under isil control or under a violent extremist islamic group. %$* 666
so that's exactly what i'm saying. %$* 666
if we could keep david petraeus on the ground in iraq working with chester crocker advising the iraqi government every step of the way, yes i think we would succeed. %$* 666
my point is we are not going to do that and because we're not going to do that trying to do it one more time we just do it round and round and round and we do not ultimately do what we need to do to let this fight play out as it's going to play out on its own. %$* 666
i'm sorry. %$* 666
michèle flournoy. %$* 13
ryan crocker i’m having terrible time today. %$* 666
michèle. %$* 13
i think the question was in the face of still vibrant isis in iraq and syria, you can't-- %$* 664
how can you get to the political progress that will ultimately resolve these situations? %$* 664
you argued for diplomacy and political settlement on both sides of this border as part of your strategy as well, but you can't get there as long as isis is a vibrant force. %$* 664
we agree that if you want to roll back isis and take them out, all right, then-- %$* 666
and you're willing to stay, you can get what did you say, general petraeus, i think you said maturing multi‐sectarian populations. %$* 666
there are no lifelines in the debate. %$* 13
i haven't seen-- %$* 666
all right. %$* 666
you can't call out. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 13
my point was i have not seen that, but if we were to get there it's going to take actually pushing them out and, once again, you don't have a strategy that can do that absent u.s. troops. %$* 666
we believe that we do and we've explained it, but i think absent that, you are condemning this region to perpetual instability, civil war, violence, and the launching-- %$* 664
the incubation of terrorism against the west. %$* 664
and against us. %$* 664
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
now, we move on to round 3.round 3 are where the debaters make closing statements from their seats. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
here to make his closing statement for the motion containment is not enough: isis must be defeated, philip zelikow, professor of history at the university of virginia, former counselor for the department of state. %$* 13
one of the things i had the sad task of doing years ago was to be the executive director of the 9/11 commission. %$* 665
this is the commission that was called upon to investigate after the fact what had happened. %$* 665
and of course, for years before 9/11, we knew al‐qaeda was at war with us. %$* 665
well, we weren't sure they were going to come to the homeland. %$* 665
and besides, if you looked at the problem-- %$* 665
and people did-- %$* 665
it was just so hard. %$* 665
look at who we'd have to work with in afghanistan-- %$* 665
the northern alliance. %$* 665
the politics of the northern alliance were nightmarish. %$* 665
there were thugs and warlords among them. %$* 665
and besides, if you wanted to do something with some special forces, there'd be risks to americans. %$* 665
and of course then came 9/11.and then here i am interviewing generals, and national security advisers, and even former presidents. %$* 665
and it's "wish we coulda, wish we shoulda." all the things that-- %$* 665
all the options they thought of doing, they considered, and they were too costly, too risky. %$* 665
and the politics of afghanistan was too hard. %$* 665
but was it really then better now to then have to occupy afghanistan and we're still there 14‐and‐a‐half years later, because we didn't take the risks, the messy politics, the hard laboring with some effort? %$* 665
instead, we ended up with catastrophe and a catastrophic commitment of the united states. %$* 665
if you want to avoid that kind of catastrophic commitment, vote for the resolution, because we need to nip this in the bud. %$* 665
we need to deal with this infection now before the gangrene spreads and the surgeon brings out the hacksaw. %$* 665
thank you, philip zelikow. %$* 13
the motion: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and here to make her closing statement against the motion, anne‐marie slaughter, president and ceo of new america and former director of policy planning for the department of state. %$* 13
so, the last time i was on this stage, i was talking about male/female equality. %$* 666
it's another hat that i wear. %$* 666
and from that perspective, isis does absolutely unspeakable things to women. %$* 666
in fact, isis-- %$* 666
is-- %$* 666
should stand for "international sex trafficking," because that is what they do. %$* 666
in hideous ways. %$* 666
and i'm not hesitant about the use of force, and i'm definitely not hesitant about u.s. leadership in the world. %$* 666
the reason i'm taking the position i'm taking is because when i read the proposition that said "containment is not enough: isis must be defeated," i saw, once again, the united states making the mistake of believing that we could solve a problem that is a decades‐ long, maybe century‐long struggle, fight, war, but among muslims. %$* 666
we should protect ourselves, absolutely. %$* 666
we should do everything we can diplomatically, digitally. %$* 666
and yes, if there is that coalition of other states or strong fighters that we can support, i would support them. %$* 666
but what's really at issue here-- %$* 666
the only thing we're disagreeing about is do you stop them where they are or do you roll them back? %$* 666
do you take away their territory? %$* 666
and my proposition is that if we, the united states, try to lead a coalition to take away their territory, we will once again find ourselves in the midst of someone else's fight in a way we do not understand, and we're often producing precisely the consequences we wish to avoid. %$* 666
thank you, anne‐marie slaughter. %$* 13
the motion is containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and here to make her closing statement in support of the motion, michèle flournoy, co‐founder and ceo of the center for a new american security and former undersecretary of defense. %$* 13
one of the most searing memories of my time in the pentagon was a visit to dover air force base. %$* 664
dover air force base is where the remains of fallen u.s. servicemen in iraq, afghanistan, wherever-- %$* 664
are brought back to the united states. %$* 664
it is the first place where the families of the fallen are able to receive their loved ones. %$* 664
on the night i was there, my first visit, it was bitterly cold. %$* 664
we were waiting on the tarmac for what seemed like forever, for a large military transport plane to come in. %$* 664
eventually, the plane came in, landed, and taxied to a stop on the tarmac. %$* 664
off to the side, nearby, away from the press, was about-- %$* 664
were about a dozen grieving, grief‐stricken families who were there to receive a father, a husband, a brother, a daughter, a sister. %$* 664
and we waited for what seemed like an eternity. %$* 664
and eventually, the back of the plane opened to reveal a row of flag‐draped caskets. %$* 664
and one by one, each of those was lovingly carried by a group of soldiers off to an awaiting family. %$* 664
it was a just unbearable and devastating scene. %$* 664
this was the cost-- %$* 664
the human cost of war. %$* 664
this was americans who had sacrificed everything for their country and families who would never again be the same. %$* 664
when we think about how we're going to fight or how we deal with isis, we need to think about dover, the human cost of the choices we make and the choices we fail to make. %$* 664
and i am here today firmly believing that if we do not adopt a more‐robust and well‐resourced strategy, where we're not doing it all by ourselves, but we are leading an international coalition to fight this horrific movement, we will spend more blood and treasure down the road. %$* 664
michèle flournoy, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
the motion is containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
and here to make his closing statement, dov zakheim, a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies, and former undersecretary of defense. %$* 13
in 2002, i was asked to help get troops and funds for that coalition-- %$* 667
first the coalition in afghanistan, then the coalition in iraq. %$* 667
i got money. %$* 667
i didn't get any troops from muslims. %$* 667
not one muslim country sent troops in, as i recall. %$* 667
some helped with training in their own countries. %$* 667
to talk of coalitions is to talk, essentially-- %$* 667
if the brits want to play again-- %$* 667
of a u.s.‐u.k, coalition with a lot of other flags. %$* 667
it's not going to work. %$* 667
general petraeus is right. %$* 667
the surge worked. %$* 667
phil, you’re right. %$* 667
with over 100,000 troops. %$* 667
and i remember sitting next to the deputy secretary of defense and testifying, who then said that general shinseki was wrong when he said we needed several hundred thousand troops to win in iraq. %$* 667
we did put six figures of troops in iraq. %$* 667
lots of troops in afghanistan. %$* 667
but that's behind us. %$* 667
it's not 9/11 anymore. %$* 667
it's not 9/12.we have a history of being in there. %$* 667
they don't want us. %$* 667
so, we have this hobbesian choice: put in loads of troops, beat isis back-- %$* 667
roll them back, as you would like-- %$* 667
and take the risk of alienating the arabs. %$* 667
or alternately, holding them in place, doing all the other things you talk about. %$* 667
but it'll take time. %$* 667
it'll take money. %$* 667
it'll take will. %$* 667
and it ain't going to happen overnight. %$* 667
and i go back to what i said earlier. %$* 667
you have made the best arguments for containment-- %$* 667
with the exception of my partner, of course-- %$* 667
that i've heard tonight. %$* 667
we cannot beat these people unless we are absolutely committed to more money, more troops, more will. %$* 667
it ain't going to happen. %$* 667
thank you. %$* 667
thank you, dov zakheim. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements in round 3.and now it's time to learn which side you believe has argued the best. %$* 13
i'm going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and vote as you did at the beginning. %$* 13
take a look at the motion again. %$* 13
pay careful attention to the phrasing, so you are clear which side you're voting on. %$* 13
but if it's for this team, it's number 1. and if it's for this team, it's number 2. %$* 13
and if you became or remain undecided, it's number 3.and we'll take about 15 to 20 seconds to let you complete the vote and lock it out. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
while that's happening, i would just like to say a few things. %$* 13
first of all, it's our goal at intelligence squared to have debates like the one we just had. %$* 13
really passionate argument, brought with respect information, intelligence, civility i want to congratulate all of these debaters for what they did. %$* 13
it's really a pleasure for us also to be partnering again with the aspen strategy group and we just need to thank a few people. %$* 13
first of all, joe nye and brent scowcroft. %$* 13
thank you very much for having us here again. %$* 13
group director and also a member of our advisory board, nick burns. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and deputy director jonathon price. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and the aspen institute president and ceo walter isaacson. %$* 13
and again we want to thank the founders of intelligence squared u.s., robert rosenkranz and alexandra munroe. %$* 13
the other thing, as i said at the beginning, this is actually a philanthropic organization. %$* 13
we-- %$* 13
this podcast and radio broadcast we give out to the world for free and we're now at the point where millions of people are listening to them and we rely on the support of a lot of donors who are also in the group. %$* 13
so, without naming you i want to thank you all for your involvement and support. %$* 13
i also want to take this opportunity to say to general petraeus i know that for a long time we've been trying to book you to be in one of our debates. %$* 13
and i think you're indicating now that you may be interested, that you're bookable, because we would love to have you in the future. %$* 13
so, we will be surrounding you for email later. %$* 13
because from the audience you debate pretty well. %$* 13
we're putting the final touches on our upcoming fall season. %$* 13
i know a lot of you do get to new york, so we want to give you a little look ahead at the topics we'll be doing there. %$* 13
broadly, we don't have the motions language framed yet, but the topics are sexual assault on campus, the chinese political and economic model, the nation's infrastructure, central banks, and affirmative action. %$* 13
we're going to be at george washington university debating the use of smart drugs and we're going to be at northwestern law school debating prosecutorial abuse. %$* 13
we will have the full lineup set by the end of the month and you can get it by visiting our website iq2us.org. %$* 13
you can buy tickets there. %$* 13
you can also sign up for our e‐blast and, again, this debate and all of our debates, we're now at i think 107 since we started, are all available via our app, which you can download from the apple store and from the google play store. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the results are all in now. %$* 13
again, the motion is this: containment is not enough: isis must be defeated. %$* 13
we had teams arguing for and against. %$* 13
you voted twice. %$* 13
again, the team whose numbers changed the most between the first and the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the preliminary vote. %$* 13
on the motion containment is not enough: isis must be defeated before you hard the arguments 52 percent of you agreed, 27 percent were against, 21 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, again, it's going to be the difference. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
on containment is not enough: isis must be defeated the team arguing for the motion their second vote 32 percent. %$* 13
they went from 52 percent to 32 percent. %$* 13
they lost 20 percentage points. %$* 13
team arguing against their first vote was 27 percent, second 59 percent. %$* 13
they went up 32 percentage points. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion declared our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, jon donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

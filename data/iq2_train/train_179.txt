well, what we-- %$* 482
what we do know is that there is a huge amount of evidence that adult disease is caused by what happens to the genome very early on, either at the time of conception, or shortly afterwards, or during pregnancy. %$* 482
and so, for example, diseases like stroke, heart disease, cancer, and so on are things which we may be imprinting on those-- %$* 482
i'm using imprinting in a-- %$* 482
right. %$* 13
but let me-- %$* 13
let me interrupt a second and to ask you a somewhat hypothetical question. %$* 13
but we're having a relatively hypothetical debate, so i would like you to entertain it. %$* 13
well, it's not hypothetical when abnormal babies are being born. %$* 482
no, no. %$* 13
the question i'm asking is going to be hypothetical. %$* 13
if, in fact, the scientific problems could be solved, if, in fact, after years or decades of investigation these unwanted side effects of genetic intervention could happen, would that change your point of view? %$* 13
in june 2000, president clinton announced, in the white house, the sequencing of the human genome. %$* 482
we now know that, actually, it's hugely more complicated than was presented then; actually, it's getting more and more complicated. %$* 482
so, actually, the problem really is that it's becoming less and less-- %$* 482
but that's why my question is hypothetical. %$* 13
unless you're saying you think it will never happen. %$* 13
i don't think we can answer a moral question on a hypothetical point. %$* 482
we have to answer it on a practical point: are we prepared to cause damage to children which they don't deserve? %$* 482
lee silver. %$* 13
well, i think the point that we're trying to make here is that there's huge diversity in the human genome among people, and if there are people in the world who have a particular form of a gene which gives them a health advantage, we know what that is, we can study that in those people. %$* 484
and that eliminates the experimentation part of this. %$* 484
sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
we have a very-- %$* 481
we have a very elaborate system in this country of allowing or not allowing people to be involved in clinical trials. %$* 481
the safety issues that have to be taking care of this, institutional review boards. %$* 481
now, if you were a woman who wanted such procedures to be done, one of the first questions you would ask is has this been done within a clinical trial setting, with the government's imprimatur, or is this being done at a hospital that has, really, no accountability to any national bioethics system? %$* 481
in fact, these experiments were done in violation of a de facto rule by the federal government, because they used private funds. %$* 481
so there is really not a good clinical trial that was used to suggest that these procedures were safe. %$* 481
there are a lot of risks that these women took. %$* 481
there's one thing, of course, is the data also curiously changed halfway through. %$* 482
so we don't actually know how many embryos really were abnormal. %$* 482
that's a big problem. %$* 482
all right. %$* 13
let's go to the other side. %$* 13
nita farahany. %$* 13
i'm so glad that you read the fact that there's no government funding for this, because the best way that we can actually have public oversight and insight into what's happening in science is by actually having transparency. %$* 483
it's true; most of the different techniques that have been-- %$* 483
that have been studied in the u.s.have happened via private companies. %$* 483
what that does is ensure that there's no opportunity for public oversight. %$* 483
all we have to do is simply fund that research in order to have public oversight. %$* 483
with public oversight, you ensure safety and efficacy. %$* 483
you ensure the ethical process of science, and you ensure the ethical use of this technology. %$* 483
all right. %$* 13
i want to put-- %$* 13
move this into this somewhat fanciful area, but i think it's relevant, on just how good it can get in the world that you're talking about, lee silver, where, as you put it before, parents can introduce to their children dna that is not their own. %$* 13
well, that's the definition of %$* 484
yeah. %$* 13
and it's an excellent one, actually. %$* 13
it really is useful for this debate. %$* 13
but you both have focused so far on, let's avoid bad situations. %$* 13
in your imagination, how far does this go in the creation of smarter, taller, prettier children? %$* 13
well, i don't know how far it goes. %$* 484
how far do you want it to go? %$* 13
how far do you-- %$* 13
how far do you dream of it going? %$* 13
it doesn't matter what i want. %$* 484
well, i want-- %$* 13
and what would you do? %$* 13
what would i do for my children? %$* 484
yeah. %$* 13
i love my children the way they are. %$* 484
are you avoiding what, to me, seems like a really relevant question. %$* 13
just what are you talking about? %$* 13
no, i don't think it's avoidance, because i don't think that's what parents care about the most. %$* 484
what parents care about the most is promoting the health during the lifetime of their child. %$* 484
and that's what they're going to focus on. %$* 484
so you don't-- %$* 13
there were intimations from this side when you used the term "the pursuit of human perfection." %$* 13
there is no such thing as human perfection. %$* 484
it's not a scientific concept. %$* 484
well, if there's a pursuit of human perfection. %$* 13
no, i don't mean-- %$* 484
that's not what parents are trying to do. %$* 484
they're trying to just-- %$* 484
give their children whatever-- %$* 484
okay. %$* 13
health advantage they can. %$* 484
that's not perfection. %$* 484
there is no perfection. %$* 484
so you're basically saying that that slippery slope is-- %$* 13
is a red herring. %$* 13
i just don't believe in perfection. %$* 484
okay. %$* 13
i just want to put it to the other side then. %$* 13
basically, i think your opponents are saying that that particular concern is a little bit chicken little. %$* 13
well, i don't think either of us have-- %$* 482
robert winston. %$* 13
i don't think either of us said we were chasing perfection. %$* 482
of course, we're not. %$* 482
i think all of us on this panel, all four of us are sensible people. %$* 482
and the areas of disagreement are perhaps quite narrow, but they are very, very important. %$* 482
and i think the issue is not perfection but the fact is that really what you are proffering, what you're offering is something which at the moment and for the foreseeable future is entirely unpredictable. %$* 482
and it's dangerous to individuals where the unpredictability %$* 482
but, robert, your partner did introduce that broader moral notion. %$* 13
you're-- %$* 13
the moral concern that you raised, sheldon krimsky, was not simply the problem of the unpredictability of the science. %$* 13
you talked about the larger vision of what we want to be as a society when we have this technology more fully developed. %$* 13
can you-- %$* 13
exactly. %$* 481
i was going to leave that for my final comments because i truly was plagued by the mitochondria problem. %$* 481
i think it is a problem for people who oppose genetically engineering babies because on one hand you feel for people, and you want them to have the best for their lives. %$* 481
so there has to be a response to the mitochondrial problem or other problems where people have two copies of a diseased gene and cannot use pre-implantation embryo or diagnosis. %$* 481
nita farahany. %$* 13
i think what's important to realize is that with every slippery slope argument, the question is, is a ban-- %$* 483
a ban outright better, or is there some middle ground? %$* 483
is there some way that we can trust society to have reasonable limitations on the advancement of technology? %$* 483
we've offered one. %$* 483
mitochondrial dna has 2 percent of your dna, but it codes only for about .1 percent of what happens in an offspring. %$* 483
it's the essential energy source. %$* 483
what if we stopped it there? %$* 483
what if we decided that that one step is something we believe is safe and efficacious? %$* 483
it would still call for not an outright ban. %$* 483
the next step would be nuclear dna. and if we felt like nuclear dna is off limits today until we have better safety studies, that would be a reasonable approach forward, and then we would say, what scientific evidence do we have? %$* 483
given the scientific evidence that we have, what ethical constraints do we as a society wish to put into place? %$* 483
we do it all the time with every technology we have. %$* 483
we don't ban technologies. %$* 483
we have public transparent debates about the best place to draw the line. %$* 483
in just a moment, i want to come to you in the audience to start taking your questions. %$* 13
and i want to remind you again how it works. %$* 13
if you just raise your hand, a microphone will be brought to you. %$* 13
if you can stand up, hold the microphone about as far away from your mouth as this one is from me so that the radio broadcast can pick you up. %$* 13
we'd appreciate it if you could state your name. %$* 13
and the hardest part of all is to be really concise and to really make it a question. %$* 13
and you'll know because a question mark goes right at the end of it. %$* 13
if that feels right, you've succeeded. %$* 13
i want to let robert winston respond. %$* 13
just a brief point about the mitochondrial thing, this extraordinarily rare situation where mitochondria are abnormal. %$* 482
the very few experiments done in animals on mitochondria, but one that stands out in my mind is a thing called the pepck mouse. %$* 482
pepck mouse whose mitochondria have been modified, runs 20 times further than a normal mouse and is much more athletic. %$* 482
it turned out completely unpredictable because it has really strange fertility disorders. %$* 482
it has a very weird metabolism. %$* 482
and above all, it's much more aggressive than other mice. %$* 482
it's not one that you'd want to have in your kitchen. %$* 482
lee silver. %$* 13
sounds like a bad mouse. %$* 13
sounds like a good mouse to me. %$* 484
but we're not arguing that the safety and efficacy exists right now for all of the possibilities of the future. %$* 484
i mean, we're talking about-- %$* 484
the mitochondria is one small case. %$* 484
in the larger sphere, we're talking about our children's children and their children. %$* 484
and the advancements in genetics are happening so fast that we can't prohibit forward advance if it's done safely and effectively. %$* 484
john, can i just tell the audience-- %$* 481
sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
what we're dealing with here with the mitochondrial case? %$* 481
the woman's egg has abnormalities in the cytoplasm. %$* 481
and the mitochondria is in the cytoplasm. %$* 481
but her dna is perfectly normal. %$* 481
so there's several ways that they deal with it. %$* 481
they either take her dna out of her egg and put it into another egg where the dna has been removed so she'd operating with her dna in somebody else's mitochondria. %$* 481
so you have then a child born with the dna of two women and then one man. %$* 481
and these interactions between the nucleus dna and the cytoplasm dna are totally unknown. %$* 481
that's right. %$* 482
there are other ways to do it. %$* 481
one way is if you have like rotten milk, you take the milk and divide it in half and then put good milk into it. %$* 481
you take the cytoplasm from a healthy egg, and you pump it into the abnormal cytoplasm of the abnormal cells so you're pumping in somebody else's dna into the woman's egg. %$* 481
and then you have the child with that, hoping that-- %$* 481
okay. %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
let me take back to nita farahany because you talked about the mitochondrial transfer in your opening statement quite extensively. %$* 13
and your opponent has basically just said the whole premise of what you're talking about is actually its own kind of crap shoot. %$* 13
so let me add one technology that my opponent didn't talk about, which is-- %$* 483
which answers his issue. %$* 483
there's a technology for mitochondrial transfer that's going to clinical trials from a company in boston this year. %$* 483
and in that technology, what they've discovered is that women have precursor cells before their egg cells. %$* 483
and those precursor cells can be used to develop their own mitochondria, healthy mitochondria. %$* 483
and they can take their own healthy mitochondria, fuse it with their own nuclear dna, and they can end up with a healthy offspring, free from mitochondrial disease. %$* 483
already in clinical trials, already ready to enroll human subjects, already with the green light to go ahead. %$* 483
you would be banning that technology and preventing women who have abnormal mitochondrial dna from being able to have the choice to have their own genetic children. %$* 483
response from the other side, or shall we go to questions from the audience? %$* 13
well, let's wait and see the results of the trial, shall we? %$* 482
i suspect that we might find some surprises as we have with every one of these other trials. %$* 482
you could argue too that you're not genetically modifying anybody because you're using the dna that's already there in the person. %$* 482
it's rather like pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. %$* 482
actually, by-- %$* 13
by lee's definition-- %$* 13
by lee's definition, that does not-- %$* 13
i think it's a spurious argument. %$* 482
and i think lee's definition is too-- %$* 483
it's modifying genetic offspring. %$* 483
surely you would also agree that that is genetic engineering, and you wouldn't – %$* 483
you keep on-- %$* 482
try to claim mitochondrial dna now is your own. %$* 483
forgive me. %$* 482
you keep on talking about 2 percent of the dna.it's not. %$* 482
it's a tiny, tiny proportion. %$* 482
it's a miniscule fraction of dna. %$* 482
tiny proportion of the information, yes. %$* 484
that's right. %$* 483
that's still two percent of dna. %$* 483
let's go to some-- %$* 13
let's go to some questions right here on the aisle, sir. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, and tell us your name, and hold the mike pretty close to your mouth – %$* 13
i'm robert klitzman from columbia university. %$* 485
great debate. %$* 485
question for the opponents, i'm wondering if we should be allowed to enhance children genetically, not perfect them, but, for instance, many parents say they'd like to have kids who are blonde haired, blue eyed. %$* 485
should that be allowed? %$* 485
should there be a line drawn anywhere in terms of enhancement, and, if so, where? %$* 485
well-- %$* 484
lee silver. %$* 13
in fact, we've actually done a poll where parents, in fact, don't believe that. %$* 484
what most parents want are children that resemble themselves, just a little bit prettier and a little bit smarter. %$* 484
that's what parents want. %$* 484
the blonde haired blue eyed thing is fiction. %$* 484
let me just add to that-- %$* 483
nita farahany. %$* 13
is that the enhancement versus therapy distinction is really just a red herring. %$* 483
so if i improve somebody's health, have i enhanced them? %$* 483
and the truth is, every improvement that we've had in our health over the past century and more has been an enhancement. %$* 483
so do parents want to enhance their children? %$* 483
of course, they do. %$* 483
they give them better education. %$* 483
they give them prenatal vitamins. %$* 483
they, you know, do prenatal yoga and every other type of thing to try to, you know, make things better. %$* 483
they take headphones and play music for their children during, you know, the gestational period. %$* 483
so do parents want to enhance their children? %$* 483
yes. %$* 483
do they already do it? %$* 483
yes. %$* 483
should genetic engineering that enhances their health be permitted to go forward? %$* 483
yes. %$* 483
and i would just add, it's not-- %$* 484
lee silver. %$* 13
an either/or. %$* 484
we all agree that environment is important, but the genes are also important. %$* 484
the other side want to respond to that? %$* 13
what i found interesting in what nita said is she said the difference between intervening so that your child will not be-- %$* 13
will not have a heart problem, say, in his 60s is a form of enhancement. %$* 13
it does make the child's life better, and maybe it's not so different from giving the child a little bit of a intelligence boost as well, that once you're making things better, you're making things better. %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
earlier-- %$* 13
you said there was a distinction between those two things, and i just want to see if you can respond to what i think her point was. %$* 13
sheldon. %$* 13
i mean-- %$* 482
robert winston. %$* 13
you know-- %$* 482
do you mind if sheldon takes it-- %$* 13
because we just haven't heard from him in a while-- %$* 13
if you have an answer to that, sheldon. %$* 13
just in the interest of fairness. %$* 13
i think my argument was that any of the factors we think about enhancement are so complex, they involve so many genes, that it would just be unrealistic to think that you can enhance a person by manipulating a few genes here or there. %$* 481
and, plus, we haven't even discussed the epigenome, which are all the switches that turn genes on and off, which are so complex-- %$* 481
but that doesn't get to the point that she was making. %$* 13
she was making the point that fixing something a little bit is not all so different from pushing something that's not fixed into a better place, not broken, into a better place. %$* 13
if she's saying that there isn't a clear distinction between a medical improvement or medical-- %$* 481
or therapy and enhancement, i actually agree-- %$* 481
okay. %$* 13
that there is a fuzzy line between enhancement and therapy. %$* 481
right in the very center. %$* 13
thank you, this is great. %$* 203
my name is gerry ohrstrom, and my question is for professor krimsky. %$* 203
professor, your debating opponent lee silver mentioned that "mother nature doesn't care." in contrast, if i infer correctly, when you briefly introduce the concept of balance in your remarks, you seem to be saying that the genome has evolved as some idealized natural balance and shouldn't be messed with. %$* 203
my question is whether this concept of balance is actually valid, given that evolution operates through randomness and through natural selection in ever-changing random contexts. %$* 203
you're saying nature-- %$* 13
is there really a place for this notion of balance or-- %$* 203
well, yeah. %$* 481
that nature could have done a much better job if this was-- %$* 13
if nature was so good at it, we would be a lot better than this? %$* 13
well, that might-- %$* 203
my question is whether the professor perceives our evolved genome as something that should be. %$* 203
or is this-- %$* 203
okay. %$* 13
hume’s fallacy? %$* 203
right. %$* 13
i think that-- %$* 481
sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
over millions of years, mistakes have been bred out to a great extent. %$* 481
and it's remarkable how many children are born normally with the billions and billions of biochemical actions that take place from the fertilized egg until the child is born. %$* 481
so a lot of mistakes were bred out of the system, and it's taken millions of years before the human genome has evolved. %$* 481
now we're saying, okay, we can get a few technologists to tinker with that and do a better job at the balancing the homeostasis of what i consider an ecosystem, a genetic ecosystem. %$* 481
and my colleague here has pointed out how many abnormalities occur when these genetic mice are manipulated. %$* 481
lee silver. %$* 13
well, i think we've learned something very important about the genome in the last five to 10 years, which is that every member of this audience has hundreds of mutations that can kill a child if they're in the same embryo as a mutation from the other partner, so it's not so pleasant. %$* 484
okay, another question, right down in the front here. %$* 13
or, actually, i like to do a little gender balance, so forgive me, but, ma'am? %$* 13
i'll come back to you-- %$* 13
if you would stand up, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
yes, my name is jane gabret this question is really for both sides of the motion. %$* 486
there has been so much in vitro fertilization that's gone on, and i know that there are many studies now that are linking a possible link autism to in vitro fertilization. %$* 486
and is that an example of seeing something after the fact-- %$* 486
a good thing, in vitro has produced many, many babies but now they're thinking that the big, huge spike in autism could have some link to that. %$* 486
robert winston. %$* 13
well, i think it's fair to say that we certainly will find some rather unusual occasions when there are abnormalities which are a result of the broad aspect of in vitro fertilization. %$* 482
there are particular issues which do change gene function; we know, for example, that embryo freezing on rare occasions changes gene function. %$* 482
we published that from my own laboratory, demonstrating that a cancer suppressing gene is suppressed in its action after routine freezing. %$* 482
we also know from animal studies in mice and rats, that there may be an increased risk of demyelination; that is, a form of me in the brain in some animals that have had a cell removed. %$* 482
now, i have to say that these things have to be much more carefully validated. %$* 482
the problem really is, with in vitro fertilization, it's probably rather like meddling with a genome: most of the time, it might well be quite safe. %$* 482
and i would not want people to go away from here thinking that ivf is a horrible thing to do for a child, it clearly isn't. %$* 482
but the full consequences of in vitro fertilization cannot be known for a very long time ahead. %$* 482
it's well worth putting your-- %$* 482
so you're-- %$* 13
so you're not saying that-- %$* 13
you're not-- %$* 13
just one point. %$* 482
it was 50 years before we fully understood the effect of ionizing radiation, and even now we can't quantify it exactly. %$* 482
okay. %$* 13
so you are not saying that you see an autism link; you are more broadly saying you don't know where things are going to go. %$* 13
and i want to take that part of the question back to the other side. %$* 13
nita farahany. %$* 13
well, quite nicely, he makes the point for us, which is there are still uncertainties with ivf and yet he's in favor of going ahead with ivf. and why is that? %$* 483
because we have to act in the face of uncertainty in life. %$* 483
i agree, there has not been a strong showing of any link between autism, maybe it has something with age of mothers who are undergoing ivf, we don't know. %$* 483
but i think the much more important question to ask is, we've been using technologies that have some uncertain risks, are the lives worth living that have resulted from those technologies? %$* 483
and the answer is yes, those are lives worth living. %$* 483
the children believe those are lives worth living, the parents believe that those were lives that were worth bringing into life. %$* 483
that's what these technologies have enabled people to do, is to bring into life a life worth living. %$* 483
there may be some risks, there may be some uncertainties, but that doesn't mean it's not worth proceeding. %$* 483
another question? %$* 13
i just want to raise the point-- %$* 484
okay, very quickly. %$* 13
we don't stop people who are both carriers for the same mutation at reproducing, even though they have 25 percent risk of having a child with a serious disease. %$* 484
we shouldn't discriminate against people just because they're infertile. %$* 484
four rows from the back, you're wearing a black and white striped shirt, thanks. %$* 13
my name is maria so science is science, and science will always have its uncertainties, but at the end of the day this is a very emotional issue, and prohibition, what we know from history, is that people do dire things when they really want to, coat hanger abortions or bootleggers. %$* 487
so to the team against-- %$* 487
or to the team arguing for prohibition, what do you tell the woman who's about to go get the equivalent of a coat hanger abortion? %$* 487
so if you can't do this, what do you tell her? %$* 487
well-- %$* 18
i think the point is a good one, which is, in the years before abortion, 1.2 million women per year had illegal abortions. %$* 483
do we really think this technology won't exist? %$* 483
i think the-- %$* 13
i think the-- %$* 13
i just want to say with respect that i think you kind confused the issue by the linkage to a coat hanger abortion, when in the case of seeking a therapy, it might be the situation that people will go offshore or that the wealthy will go offshore which was a point that was brought up earlier. %$* 13
so would you be willing to rephrase your question to say, what are you going to say to women who can't get this while other women can? %$* 13
because i-- %$* 13
i don't know that there's going to be a back alley, you know, geneticist working this. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 487
so i'd like-- %$* 13
i'd like to rephrase the question. %$* 13
i'd like to rephrase the question to this side, that if in-- %$* 13
if the technology in particular, as nita farahany had said in the u.s. being left behind, if it's going to be available overseas in safe clinical settings, but you have to be rich to get there or connected, what are you going to say to the women who can't get there? %$* 13
and i'll put that to sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
to the women who cannot get the genetic engineering for this problem? %$* 481
in a world-- %$* 13
in a world where it's already-- %$* 13
where the train's left the station. %$* 13
in a world where just the wealthy can get it. %$* 19
genetic-- %$* 481
genetically modifying human reproductive cells is a totally new frontier. %$* 481
it has lots of risks, and its risks are not only to the individuals who are involved in it. %$* 481
its risks are to the society as a whole or to other societies, a new hitlerian society that arises. %$* 481
the last thing you want to do is to provide a technology that could be misused by authoritarian societies for their own functions. %$* 481
and this is a totally novel frontier that we should be extraordinarily cautious about in trying to break through. %$* 481
we have never done this before. %$* 481
those examples that she gave us are very tentative. %$* 481
they're full of risks. %$* 481
and if we produce the child that was abnormal, then society would have to deal with it. %$* 481
okay. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters arguing out this motion: prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
nita farahany, do you want to respond to the questioner's point? %$* 13
i think that the answer was not particularly forthcoming in addressing what happens when people who are desperate, particularly women, for example, who have mitochondrial disease, who are going to pass it on to every one of their children and want to have a choice to have a genetic child. %$* 483
what are they going to do? %$* 483
well, they will go abroad. %$* 483
the technology will go abroad. %$* 483
and what does the prohibition then look like in this country? %$* 483
does it mean that we show up with handcuffs at the airport, and we arrest the person? %$* 483
does it mean that we forcibly test everyone? %$* 483
because what we're arguing for here is not adding in genomes outside of the human genome, into children. %$* 483
we're arguing that the babies would look identical to ones that are already in our population. %$* 483
so how are we going to detect those differences? %$* 483
and what is the society that prohibits it like going to look like? %$* 483
is it forcible sterilizations? %$* 483
is it forcible genetic testing? %$* 483
how are we going to detect it? %$* 483
how are we going to enforce it? %$* 483
and is that a kind of society that we want where we intrude that deeply into our private lives? %$* 483
do you want to-- %$* 13
i want to respond directly-- %$* 484
lee silver, go ahead. %$* 13
to the point that you made, sheldon, which is that the children are going to be born and society is not going to take care of them. %$* 484
every year 4 percent of children born from natural reproduction have birth defects. %$* 484
some children are abandoned by their parents. %$* 484
and an ethical society takes care of those children. %$* 484
i don't see why it would be any different in the future, no matter how children come into conception. %$* 484
sir, down in the front here. %$* 13
and a mic will come to you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 488
my name is harlon millcove and my question is, is there a concern that through genetic engineering a defect in dna could be introduced that isn't known until several generations later, by which point there is, you know, potential damage to the gene pool that might affect-- %$* 488
this side has actually said that it has that concern, so let me have you put your question to this side. %$* 13
and did everyone hear the question clearly? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
sheldon-- %$* 13
lee silver. %$* 13
the questions whether the defects can be introduced into the genome, let's compare what already exists. %$* 484
in your genome, there are defects right now. %$* 484
you have a hundred mutations that could have caused childhood disease. %$* 484
you have deletions of genetic information. %$* 484
so you have all sorts of defects in your genome right now. %$* 484
we're talking about technology which we all think should be done only when it's proven safe and effective. %$* 484
sir, down in front here. %$* 13
jamie metzl. %$* 489
first, thanks to intelligence squared for this incredible debate. %$* 489
i believe, as many of us here, this is one of the most important issues that our species will face in our future, so it's great that we're having this important conversation. %$* 489
the arguments of both sides seem to rely on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis process. %$* 489
in the case of the affirmative for screening and in the negative for engineering. %$* 489
my question is, does this mean that by both of your arguments, in the future, sex will be a form of recreation, but ivf will be the preferred form of procreation for advantaged people? %$* 489
sex is already a form of recreation. %$* 481
yeah. %$* 13
good answer. %$* 483
we're all looking at the british guy. %$* 13
well, you just heard it from our side already. %$* 483
i got the impression it was a rhetorical question. %$* 482
i think it was a rhetorical question, and it got a good laugh. %$* 13
ma'am, on the aisle there. %$* 13
you've had your hand up a long time, and a mic's coming from-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
oh, no, no. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i meant the woman who's standing. %$* 13
i'm sorry to disappoint you. %$* 13
and i will come back to you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 490
my name is michelle boardman. %$* 490
the debate is focused properly i think on ethical and practical questions. %$* 490
but i have a question about rights. %$* 490
so what right, if any, does a potential parent have to access these technologies, such that a ban would violate those rights? %$* 490
nita farahany, do you believe in a rights issue? %$* 13
i think the question about procreative rights and liberties is a very difficult question. %$* 483
if your question is, is there a constitutional right to access technologies, i'd say no. %$* 483
if the question is, is there a natural right that people should have over procreative liberties, over the choices that they make about having children and who they meet with and whether or not they bring a healthy child into the world, i think that that is the most fundamental of rights that a person has. %$* 483
and an outright ban threatens to intrude upon that in so many different ways, not the least of which is the method of enforcement that you would have to use. %$* 483
we are being live streamed on fora.tv, and people who are watching us are sending in questions. %$* 13
and i want to read one that's just been handed to me. %$* 13
and it's for lee silver. %$* 13
and we've touched on this broadly, but this makes it more specific. %$* 13
"what about a scenario where employers would only hire enhanced people because they will be less prone to issues? %$* 13
isn't there a potential to create a fragmented society where only privileged populations can afford it? %$* 13
" lee silver. %$* 13
well, that's the "gattaca" scenario of people being evaluated solely on their genes. %$* 484
i don't think it's realistic because an employer is always going to look at the productivity and the past performance of a person when they hire because that's much more-- %$* 484
much stronger than whatever genetic predisposition they might have. %$* 484
i just want to add a quick thought on that, which is-- %$* 483
nita farahany. %$* 13
we want to be careful to not convey the idea of genetic determinism, that there is a one-to-one relationship between genes and behavior and identity, because there simply isn't. %$* 483
we know far too much about the interaction of the environment and so many other things that give rise to our behaviors and our identities. %$* 483
so the idea that genetic engineering will result in a particular type of behavior that employers can then screen for simply belies an earlier conception of genetic determinism that we have rejected, and we should continue to reject. %$* 483
robert winston, your opponent. %$* 13
112 years ago, one of the most famous british scientists ever, lord calvin, said, "you can take it from me, heavier than air flight is impossible." two years later, orville wright flew his biplane. %$* 482
i would strongly recommend that you don't ask scientists at all ever for predictions. %$* 482
we are no more cable of predicting where we will be in five years than anybody else. %$* 482
it's a massive mistake. %$* 482
that's why we have to act responsibly now. %$* 482
going to come to another question. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i don't see a hand up anywhere. %$* 13
oh, right down in front, please. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13

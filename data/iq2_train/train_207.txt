tonight’s debate is taking place in partnership with the richard paul richman center for business, law, and public policy, which is a joint venture of the columbia law school and the columbia business school. %$* 13
we want to thank them for partnering with us tonight and are very pleased to introduce dr. %$* 13
christopher mayer, paul milstein professor of real estate and co-director of the richman center who’s here to say a few words. %$* 13
thanks a lot john, good evening, welcome everybody. %$* 545
on behalf of the richard paul richman center for business, law, and public policy it is my honor to welcome all of you to this evening’s debate. %$* 545
the debate marks the fourth time that the richman center has partnered with intelligence squared u.s.in furtherance of our mission to promote evidence-based public policy, and dialogue on timely and relevant policy issues. %$* 545
inaugurated in may of 2011, the richman center provides a platform for scholars of law and business schools to collaborate and formulate ideas and debate important public policy issues, and to inspire students to pursue careers in areas at the intersection of business, law, and public policy. %$* 545
this evening’s debate addresses whether online education, such as massive open online courses, they’re called moocs, will fundamentally alter the traditional classroom ecosystem in higher education, or serve to enhance the college-based educational experience. %$* 545
i am proud that the richman center and intelligence squared u.s.have picked up the gauntlet on this issue and worked so diligently to bring us four of the most notable figures engaged in leading the dialogue on online education, and what better place to hold such a debate than on the campus of columbia university, at least so long as campuses exist, as we may find out. %$* 545
i wanted to thank intelligence squared u.s., and robert rosenkranz in particular, for their ongoing partnership and collaboration. %$* 545
thank you to richard paul richman, who is here with us tonight, for his ongoing support and generosity. %$* 545
thanks to each of the debaters and the moderator, john, for engaging in this important topic. %$* 545
and most importantly, i’d like to thank all of you who are attending the debate and actually participating in the conversation this evening. %$* 545
and now i’d like to bring back john donvan, who, in addition to his many wonderful qualifications, is actually a graduate of columbia’s journalism school—so we wanted to welcome you back. %$* 545
thanks very much. %$* 13
it's a home team crowd for me. %$* 13
and so the next conversation i want to have-- %$* 13
and this is part of the ritual of intelligence squared-- %$* 13
our founder, robert rosenkranz likes to come on stage and share with-- %$* 13
he's spent some time thinking in advance about what debates should we be putting on in a season, and he comes on and shares with us how we got to this debate, why this topic, why now? %$* 13
and in general, he's made intelligence squared u.s.possible. %$* 13
so please give him a round of applause as we bring him to the stage. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 1
so normally you talk us through a little bit of the pros and cons that we're likely to hear. %$* 13
but before we get to that, i need to bring up the fact that i find it curious that at another university campus that we shall not name in a city called new haven, connecticut, there stands a building called rosenkranz hall. %$* 13
same last name as yours, which suggests to me that you may actually, as in fact the benefactor of that building, you have some kind of a commitment to the bricks thing, do you not? %$* 13
well, i do, but-- %$* 1
but i try to be fair and balanced. %$* 1
so my most recent yale philanthropy was a fund to create online courses for yale professors, to the center for educational innovation at yale, so i'm on both sides of this issue. %$* 1
so have you ever actually tried an online course? %$* 13
you know, actually, i did. %$* 1
i was-- %$* 1
i felt like online courses might be a truly revolutionary kind of development in education. %$* 1
and out of personal curiosity i took a course in statistics. %$* 1
and i thought it was fascinating. %$* 1
it had a number of elements that really seemed very interesting to me. %$* 1
first of all, you could go at your own pace, which you can't normally. %$* 1
secondly, you've got instant feedback or continual feedback as the material was presented. %$* 1
i gave wrong answers deliberately in some cases just to see where that led, and it gave you hints as to where you went wrong and how to correct yourself. %$* 1
so it seemed like a very, very interesting way of learning with frequent rewards and frequent feedback. %$* 1
did you get a grade? %$* 13
i did. %$* 1
how'd you do? %$* 13
i did fine. %$* 1
so it sounds like you just sort of made the case for why-- %$* 13
why there's an appeal to the online course. %$* 13
what's the opposite argument? %$* 13
well, i think the opposite argument is that you really-- %$* 1
there's something very much missing in a purely online approach to education. %$* 1
you miss the give and take of a vital classroom. %$* 1
you miss the requirement to think on your feet, to try to persuade other people. %$* 1
so i could well imagine that somebody could learn to be a very good statistician taking statistics courses online. %$* 1
but i can't imagine that somebody would learn to be a great debater doing that. %$* 1
you need the personal touch. %$* 13
i think you do. %$* 1
well, let's see how we can test our people on the personal touch as debaters tonight. %$* 13
i think they'll do fine. %$* 1
let's welcome them to this stage, our debaters, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
thank you, bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
and i would just like to ask for one more round of applause to bob rosenkranz and to richard paul richmond for bringing this debate to us here tonight. %$* 13
so an idea for the times we live in. %$* 13
who needs the college campus anyway? %$* 13
college by internet: you get to learn at home, you make your own schedule, you save money. %$* 13
but did we hear some of this going on already back in 1948? %$* 13
college by radio, when nbc collaborated with the university of kentucky to put courses on the air waves; college by television, when britain ran its great experiment called "the open university."it's been going since 1971.the thing is the demise of the traditional college campus has been talked about for a long time now. %$* 13
but it has held off against all of these technological assaults so far. %$* 13
and the question is, would it be different this time with online education? %$* 13
is this a game changer that will make the traditional lecture hall obsolete? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate. %$* 13
so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete, a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are here at columbia university's miller theatre. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete. %$* 13
our debate, as always, goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is, more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome anant agarwal. %$* 13
and, anant, you are a professor at mit.you are the ceo of edx.that is an online learning platform founded by harvard and by mit.recently, it was announced that columbia would also become one of its charter members. %$* 13
anant, you are not only the ceo and the first president of edx, but you also taught its first course, which was circuits and electronics. %$* 13
you had an enrollment of 155,000 students from 162 countries. %$* 13
is this a hard course? %$* 13
it's not a hard course. %$* 546
it is an mit hard course. %$* 546
it had differential equations as its prerequisites. %$* 546
and we were petrified we would have a hundred people sign up for the course, looking at the differential equation prerequisites. %$* 546
we were shocked when we had 10,000 people register in the first hour of announcing it. %$* 546
and before we knew it, 155,000 people signed up for this hard course. %$* 546
how many passed? %$* 13
so more people passed this course than i would be able to teach at mit if i were to teach it at mit for 40 years. %$* 546
how many passed? %$* 13
7,200. %$* 546
wow. %$* 13
but less than 5 percent. %$* 13
correct. %$* 546
the same percentage pass the course as mit admitted into its current batch. %$* 546
mit admitted 7 percent of the people who applied to mit this year. %$* 546
somehow the same number passed this mit hard course. %$* 546
okay. %$* 13
i can see you're good with numbers. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome anant agarwal. %$* 13
and anant, tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
ben nelson. %$* 546
ladies and gentlemen, welcome ben nelson, please. %$* 13
ben, you are also arguing for the motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." in 2010, you left your job as ceo of snapfish, you had a plan to reinvent the university experience. %$* 13
the result is the minerva project. %$* 13
it's an elite-- %$* 13
meant to be elite online undergraduate program. %$* 13
and your plan is to rival the kind of education you can get at the ivies at a fraction of the cost. %$* 13
and you said you want to make it more difficult to get into minerva than to get into yale. %$* 13
so how many people were in your inaugural class? %$* 13
so we admitted 45 students this year. %$* 547
that represents a 2 1/2 percent acceptance rate. %$* 547
and we admitted these students not based on an artificial capacity constraint, but we actually admitted every single person that passed our bar, and one of the extraordinary students was right there in the audience. %$* 547
where are you? %$* 13
we'll chat with you later. %$* 13
you can ask a question. %$* 13
so it's obviously-- %$* 13
there's-- %$* 13
you obviously are finding a market for this? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 547
our-- %$* 547
the demand that we have received for minerva has been extraordinary because we not only are tapping a global market, but we also are approaching admissions purely on the basis of the human potential of this candidate and not about their lineage or who their parents are, what country they were born in. %$* 547
but you want it to be elite? %$* 13
we are designing the curriculum such that it is made for the very-- %$* 547
the very most capable people in the world. %$* 547
okay, so by one definition it's "elite." ladies and gentlemen, thanks to ben, and welcome to the debate. %$* 13
our motion is, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." we have two debaters who are arguing against this motion. %$* 13
first, please welcome jonathan cole. %$* 13
jonathan, this is a home crowd for you. %$* 13
you are the john mitchell mason professor at columbia university. %$* 13
you served 14 years as provost and dean of faculties. %$* 13
you wrote the book, "the great american university." you wrote the book about this whole story which traces the origins and the evolution of american higher education. %$* 13
you've been in academia your entire career, and this particular university, columbia, you have seen through decades and decades of change and growth. %$* 13
and just to give the audience an idea of how much change and growth, what year did you actually start at columbia? %$* 13
i began the fall of 1960.i have never left, and i say i'm not gainfully employable by any other institution, quite frankly. %$* 548
but i've been here. %$* 548
i've gone through many roles, and i've seen many changes, from wearing a beanie as a freshman and having tug of wars with ropes to-- %$* 548
well, i won't go into the rest. %$* 548
i mean-- %$* 548
back in 1960, you had to ride a horse to get to class? %$* 13
if you had a horse. %$* 548
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan cole. %$* 13
and, jonathan, your partner is? %$* 13
rebecca schuman. %$* 548
she's fantastic, irrepressible, and logically, incredibly sound. %$* 548
ladies and gentlemen, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
schuman, you are arguing against the motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." you are a columnist for slate. %$* 13
you are also a writer for the chronicle of higher education and with its vitae project. %$* 13
you are also an adjunct professor at the university of missouri, st. %$* 13
louis. %$* 13
you teach german. %$* 13
so you are really in the trenches. %$* 13
this is the real world for you, and you're living it. %$* 13
we're curious. %$* 13
have you ever had a conversation with your students in your german class about their preferences or dislike, however, for online education and for what are called moocs? %$* 13
yeah, actually i was just talking to them about it yesterday. %$* 549
i don't teach german right now. %$* 549
i teach something similar to the core curriculum here at columbia actually. %$* 549
i teach a freshman literature sequence. %$* 549
and i asked them yesterday, "how do you guys feel about moocs and how do you feel about online classes? %$* 549
" they didn't know what moocs are, and most of them do not like their online classes. %$* 549
well, that sounds like an advantage for your side already. %$* 13
all right, ladies and gentlemen, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and we're going to be hearing that term, "moocs," so stay tuned to hear it defined, because it's important. %$* 13
now, this is a debate, and that means it's actually a contest, a clash of ideas, and one side will win and one side will lose. %$* 13
and that will be determined by the vote of our live audience here at columbia university. %$* 13
we want to go now to set you up to vote twice, once before the debate, and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the way that we determine the winner is the team whose numbers have changed the most. %$* 13
so we want to set you up with the first vote. %$* 13
go to the keypad at your seat, and register for us where you stand at this point on this motion, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." if you agree with this motion at this point push number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree with this motion push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided push number three. %$* 13
and the system will lock out in about 20 seconds. %$* 13
if you pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself. %$* 13
it'll lock in your most recent vote, and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and, again, at the end of the debate we'll have you vote a second time, and we'll look at the difference between the votes. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so we're going to go in three rounds, and we're just going to start now with round one. %$* 13
round one, our motion is this, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here in round one to open and arguing for the motion, anant agarwal. %$* 13
he is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit and the ceo of edx, an online learning destination founded by harvard at mit.he'll be making his way to the lectern to make his opening statement. %$* 13
it will be seven minutes long uninterrupted. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, anant agarwal. %$* 13
let me just correct. %$* 13
i said seven minutes. %$* 13
it's six minutes of statement. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
the floor is yours. %$* 13
you know, i'm going back to when i was an undergraduate, oh my god, 30 years ago, 32, 31 years ago. %$* 546
i'm sitting in class and this is like most of the classes i've been in. %$* 546
this was at iit in madras, lots of bright kids around me, extraordinary and bright. %$* 546
and the fifth minute mark was my transition point, i would follow everything the lecturer did, the instructor did until the fifth minute mark, and then at the fifth minute mark i would lose the professor. %$* 546
and i would look at all-- %$* 546
and everybody seemed to be following the professor, but i would've lost the professor and then spent the remaining hour simply scrambling taking notes, completely-- %$* 546
i just lost the professor, scrambling taking down every word with no idea what is going on. %$* 546
i wonder how many of you in the audience have felt like that in a classroom. %$* 546
i won't ask for a show of hands, i just want you to think about it. %$* 546
i certainly felt oh my god, everybody around me knows what's going on, what's up with me? %$* 546
our education system, this whole system of the lecture and getting together a lot more students in the classroom really is based on the factory model of education. %$* 546
get a whole bunch of people sitting in a classroom and then you have a person lecturing at them. %$* 546
it's a very, very efficient system, it started a thousand years ago, and this university below me is still standing, it's a thousand years old, and you know what? %$* 546
nothing has changed. %$* 546
you could wake up a thousand years behind you or a thousand years ahead and absolutely nothing has changed. %$* 546
everything has changed around us, but the university education system hasn't. %$* 546
our communication is different. %$* 546
we don't have to yell across a continent. %$* 546
we have smartphones. %$* 546
our medical system has changed. %$* 546
we don't have to hit somebody on the head to knock them unconscious and operate very quickly. %$* 546
we have laparoscopy today, but education system hasn't changed. %$* 546
we can fly from one continent to another, communicate in all kinds of ways, but our education system hasn't changed. %$* 546
don’t you believe it is important? %$* 546
we can do-- %$* 546
the online education of today is very different from my grandfather's online education. %$* 546
it's completely different today. %$* 546
in this new system we can use self-based learning. %$* 546
just imagine i can watch a video of an instructor. %$* 546
i can pause the video. %$* 546
i can rewind the video. %$* 546
not once, but six times. %$* 546
heck, i can even mute the professor. %$* 546
this self-based system allows me to learn at my own pace. %$* 546
i wish i had that when i was an undergraduate student. %$* 546
another thing, i would submit my homework and i would get the graded homework back two weeks later if i was lucky. %$* 546
i still haven't gotten some homework back 32 years later. %$* 546
no feedback. %$* 546
the feedback came too late. %$* 546
i wasn't interested in the feedback when it came late. %$* 546
but in online learning today, if you go onto edx.org or one of the mooc platforms, feedback is instantaneous. %$* 546
we can grade all kinds of questions, equations we can even grade essays, believe it or not. %$* 546
so that feedback comes instantly. %$* 546
i can get a-- %$* 546
when something's wrong i can think about it, fix it. %$* 546
i can learn. %$* 546
in fact, i learn the most when something is wrong say hey, what do i do here? %$* 546
i can try to fix it. %$* 546
instant feedback is critical. %$* 546
in the many, many studies education researchers have known this for 40 years. %$* 546
study chen in 2003 showed that if you apply instant feedback students learn better. %$* 546
if you don’t provide instant feedback they don’t learn as well. %$* 546
we also do another thing, we use active learning. %$* 546
again, these ideas are old ideas, we've just not applied them. %$* 546
there’s a very famous paper by craik and lockhart talked about active learning. %$* 546
heck, just go back to socrates. %$* 546
it's a socratic method. %$* 546
you know, you teach by asking questions. %$* 546
so now what we can do is we can interweave videos with interactive exercises. %$* 546
so you watch a video at your own pace then you go answer a question to see if you've learned the material or not. %$* 546
this is mastery learning. %$* 546
if you haven't quite gotten it you go back and review the video or the materials, you come back and you try it again. %$* 546
so this way you don’t face forward until you have picked up and really learned the material. %$* 546
and studies like the craik and lockhart study from as early as ’72 has shown that this, again, improves learning outcomes. %$* 546
so online learning today incorporates all of these principles and is completely different from what it was before. %$* 546
we can even bring gamification to our system. %$* 546
we can do online labs, check out the demo course on edx, it’s called demo 101.we have online labs in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics. %$* 546
you can play around and bring gamification into the picture. %$* 546
our millennial generation is completely different. %$* 546
just two weeks ago i remember walking past my daughter's room, she's 14, and she was lying in bed. %$* 546
she's got three screens in front of her. %$* 546
okay, on one screen she was doing physics. %$* 546
on the second screen, she swiped my ipad, and she's watching netflix, and on her third screen, she was “whatsapp-ing”, now, whatever that is, with her friends. %$* 546
it's not tweeting anymore. %$* 546
it's “whatsapping” with her friends. %$* 546
and they learn differently. %$* 546
the millennial generation is able to do these things. %$* 546
and then in the classroom, you still need that. %$* 546
you interact with each other, learn the soft skills and so on and so forth. %$* 546
but they can get all the content and so on completely online if that's how they want to learn. %$* 546
they want gamification, they want engagement, not the same old boring lecture where they lost the professor after the first minute everywhere. %$* 546
everybody should really have a high-quality education. %$* 546
and with online learning, i can really bring this to the classroom as well. %$* 546
and bringing online learning to create the blended model of learning. %$* 546
in an experiment we did with san jose state university, they used their online material in class to create the blended model. %$* 546
students would watch videos, interactive exercises in this active learning model before they came to class. %$* 546
and in class, they would ask questions of the professor, interact with other students and learn soft skills and collaboration. %$* 546
but a big part was online. %$* 546
and here they demonstrated that traditionally, the students were-- %$* 546
60 percent of the students would pass the course, 40 percent would fail. %$* 546
in this blended model at san jose state using our material online, they found that the failure rate fell to 9 percent. %$* 546
anant agarwal, i'm sorry. %$* 13
you're time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
anant agarwal, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and here to make his position clear against this motion, jonathan cole. %$* 13
he is the john mitchell mason professor at columbia university where he served as provost and dean of faculties. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jonathan cole. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 548
and then there were moocs. %$* 548
the latest technological messianic movement that will disrupt and then save higher education. %$* 548
i want to make 12 points in six minutes as to why you should vote against the motion that more clicks will end the need for bricks and alter fundamentally the nature of higher education. %$* 548
online education will not replace the great colleges and universities in the united states. %$* 548
at the selective colleges, moocs will be one of the many forms of new technology that will be useful, mostly for courses, as was pointed out by my worthy opponent, for those where you can get the right answer that's at the back of the book. %$* 548
for all other courses where there are subtleties and interpretation, where there's a need to argue, for a close-knit community of participants, where there's a need for critical thinking, for close reading, where analysis plays back and moderates initial formulations, moocs will be less useful. %$* 548
in fact, as the biological scientist stuart feinstein says, "questions are more relevant than answers." indeed, richard levin recently signed on as the ceo of coursera, and he said that it couldn't replace the traditional four-year residential college. %$* 548
let's take the democratizing effect. %$* 548
levin says that's what one of the purposes is. %$* 548
but who in fact takes those courses from all over the world. %$* 548
the noble purpose, the people who take that course at least from the evidence that we have to the moment, are people who are already educated, not the people who we're trying to target for education. %$* 548
the next point is that there is no good empirical evidence that supports the idea that moocs represent a disruptive technology that will overturn the current business model of the best colleges and universities. %$* 548
let me just tick off a few of the things for which there is absolutely no good empirical evidence. %$* 548
there's no economic or cost model that has been shown to work. %$* 548
the cost of creating content is very high. %$* 548
friends of mine have told me that they spend $100, $200,000 or $300,000 a course. %$* 548
in short, there's no evidence that moocs will in fact lower the cost of tuition. %$* 548
there's no method that has been shown as to how intellectual property will be divided up, how much will go to the professors, how much to the university? %$* 548
there's no good evidence that moocs have a democratizing effect as much as they might be desirable to have a democratizing effect. %$* 548
there's no good evidence of how people with different learning styles respond to the flipped classroom and the mooc culture on campus. %$* 548
there's no good evidence on how you can examine thousands of people taking online courses without massive cheating. %$* 548
there's no good evidence about who drops out of mooc courses. %$* 548
those 7,000 who graduated may well have been people who already took the course at mit. now, how do we know who they really are and what their characteristics are? %$* 548
72 percent of the professors who answered the questionnaire about teaching online courses, who were committed to them, said that they would not give credit for those who did well in the course. %$* 548
sebastian thrune, one of the founders of one of the leading moocs, udacity, has said we were on the front pages of the newspapers and magazines and at the same time i was realizing we don't educate people as others wished or as i wished. %$* 548
we have a lousy product. %$* 548
it was a painful moment. %$* 548
people learn from each other when they eat together, read together, converse together, sleep together. %$* 548
if nothing else, sex will reinforce bricks over clicks on the campus. %$* 548
this is not to say, i want you to know that the khan academy where small, short, highly focused courses are offered won't be appealing to some. %$* 548
it is, and it will be. %$* 548
but it is not going to end the need for the kind of close interaction that we need to find in the classroom in physical structures. %$* 548
moocs will not solve the cost disease. %$* 548
i will answer what the cost disease is and why they won't actually lower tuition and the increases in tuition that you have read about in the papers during our next part of this debate. %$* 548
let many platforms grow. %$* 548
i don't know how many of you have seen brian greene, the physicist at columbia's new platform on-- %$* 548
he created for the world science fair, it takes place in new york. %$* 548
he built it himself. %$* 548
it is for people who know nothing about science to nobel prize winners. %$* 548
it is far more sophisticated than the platforms like edx.one author allowed many of these platforms to grow and see how they work. %$* 548
moocs are one tool that will help to make higher learning better, not cheaper, for both undergraduates and professional school students. %$* 548
it's not likely to infiltrate the world of the laboratory, however. %$* 548
remember, what makes american universities the greatest system of higher learning in the world is the research discoveries that have changed our lives and the lives of people around the world. %$* 548
you never hear the mooc discussers, the mooc proponents, talk about the influence of moocs on laboratory life. %$* 548
it will have a tremendous effect on accessing information; jstor, artstor, visual libraries, all of these things are wonderful inventions and part of technology that help us learn. %$* 548
but that is no substitute for being able to analyze moby dick. %$* 548
thank you. %$* 548
jonathan cole, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 548
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." you have heard from the first two debaters and now onto the third. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the lectern ben nelson. %$* 13
he is the founder, chairman and ceo of the minerva project. %$* 13
that is a new online undergraduate program that aims to reinvent the university experience. %$* 13
and, ben, we had four teachers up here, and i was hoping that one of them would, in the opening statements, explain to those who do not know what a mooc is. %$* 13
so i want to give you an extra 15 seconds before you launch to tell everyone in our audience and our listeners what this odd word means and why it is exceedingly relevant to this discussion. %$* 13
so a mooc is a massive open online course. %$* 547
and as jonathan pointed out, it is one of several formats and technologies used for online education. %$* 547
that's perfect. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, in his opening statement, please welcome ben nelson. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 547
thank you so much for having us, and thank you, jonathan, for pointing out two very important things; first, that i should have absolutely gone to columbia as an undergrad because they have sex in class. %$* 547
and i certainly made a huge mistake going to penn. %$* 547
we did not have that. %$* 547
and secondly, thank you for making such a compelling argument to vote for this motion. %$* 547
the-- %$* 547
what jonathan put together as the framework was a critique of the state of online education, not even online education, but a segment of online education today, as it stands. %$* 547
it was not a critique of the potential of online education, and it was based on an analysis of a very small portion of american higher education, these small courses in the most elite institutions in the united states. %$* 547
but we're not talking about the future of the most elite institutions. %$* 547
we're talking about the future of higher education in general. %$* 547
and so let's look at the facts. %$* 547
the facts of the matter are that when you look at what even the elite universities do, they are largely about disseminating knowledge, lecture- based courses, the lecture hall, where a university professor stands up in front of a large audience, gets paid $300,000, $400,000, fully loaded, and teaches one, maybe two courses a year to 200 students, is not an economically viable model. %$* 547
and it is in fact a worse form of delivery than what anant described, the very first version, the version 1.0, of these massive open online courses. %$* 547
the fact of the matter is, is that all of the problems listed about moocs, whether we're talking about who is taking them, cheating, whether we're talking about the completion rates, whether we're talking about whether or not it's economical to create the upfront costs, all of those problems got solved over time. %$* 547
and even before they do, with identity verification online, with the fact that once you create one of these moocs, it can be taken to hundreds of thousands of dollars-- %$* 547
once you realize that the fact that these courses are not completed or they're taken by the people that already have a university education, not because they're the only ones that can benefit from them, but because today they're not issued for credit. %$* 547
compare completion rates at massive open online courses-- %$* 547
that are there purely for fun-- %$* 547
versus the completion rate at chicago community college. %$* 547
they're both in the single digit percentages. %$* 547
but when you go to chicago community college, you're going there and paying to get your associate's degree. %$* 547
here you have an opportunity to learn for free, and you have an opportunity to learn at your own pace with those around you. %$* 547
but let's go beyond the lecture. %$* 547
let's address even the most esoteric elements of higher education. %$* 547
the close conversations between students and professor is small groups that explore subject matter. %$* 547
well, turns out you can do that online as well, and you can do it in a better way than you can in an offline classroom. %$* 547
when we first created our platform at minerva, which is limited to 19 students per course, every student is on live video, we went to the university of washington medical school and we tested a very rudimentary version of our platform with a live class offline and a live class online, taught by the same professor, the same subject matter. %$* 547
the results were universally accepted that the online class was far superior to the offline class simply for the fact of the matter that even though there were the same number of students in the class, when you look straight into that camera and the professor sees your face and all of the other students see your face, you are paying attention. %$* 547
the professor can call on students and ask them a question and find out what they're going to answer rather than having them ask or answer at random. %$* 547
so the professor can choose to pick not the right answer but the spectacularly wrong answer which is interesting, one that curates the course of the conversation in ways that simply are not possible offline. %$* 547
what we all have to remember is we are at the dawn of interactive, high quality, personalized education, whether it's a broadcast to many, whether it's in a small seminar format, or whether it is done in an individualized adaptive learning platform that caters the process of education to the individual student. %$* 547
but the fact that we are at the dawn means that none of us in this room, including anant and myself, who are working on this every day, can conceive where this will bring us in the future. %$* 547
here's what we do know. %$* 547
we do know that when students are given the option of going to their illustrious lectures, even at the world's best universities, there are far more students on the first day of class than there are on the last day. %$* 547
we know that oftentimes when we ask students, "did the courses that you took in your college career change your life? %$* 547
did they make an impactful change in the way you perceive the world? %$* 547
" majority of students say, "no." we know that technologies will continue to improve and will bring intellectual development of students not just among the elite but among students around the world to a newer and higher level. %$* 547
thank you. %$* 547
thank you, ben nelson. %$* 13
our motion is, "more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete." and now to hear-- %$* 13
to her argument against this motion, let's welcome rebecca schuman. %$* 13
she is a columnist for slate and the-- %$* 13
for the chronicle of higher education's vitae hub and the author of the forthcoming book, "kafka and wittgenstein." ladies and gentlemen, rebecca schuman. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 549
thank you so much everybody for being here and to my co-panelists for just presenting. %$* 549
anant, i tried really hard to get my assignments back to my students really fast. %$* 549
i really try my best and i always make it in under two weeks, but now i'm going to try even harder. %$* 549
i really appreciate jonathan. %$* 549
he brought up the fact that in person i like to teach classes where you can't get the answers in the back of the book. %$* 549
in my class there is no back of the book or the back of the book is just the last chapter of the book. %$* 549
it wouldn't really help. %$* 549
and, ben, i did not know i made $400,000 a year-- %$* 549
to be honest. %$* 549
i teach two classes a year and i make $14,000 a year. %$* 549
so, i don't know. %$* 549
i’m doing it wrong. %$* 549
all right. %$* 549
so what i want to talk to you guys about is the mooc i'm taking right now. %$* 549
i’m taking mooc with edx and you sign up with edx.they ask you why you're signing up and i wrote definitely not for opposition research for the debate i'm going to do. %$* 549
i didn't say that. %$* 549
it's called think 101x the science of everyday thinking with two good professors from australia. %$* 549
actually, i love it. %$* 549
it's great. %$* 549
it's really fun. %$* 549
i've learned all sorts of different nefarious ways my own brain goes behind my back to thwart me. %$* 549
i love it. %$* 549
it's fantastic. %$* 549
it's pretty easy. %$* 549
it doesn't take too much time. %$* 549
i've learned a lot. %$* 549
should i go over there? %$* 549
but i'm a 37 year old american with a doctorate. %$* 549
i already know how to learn. %$* 549
i learn for fun. %$* 549
i do it as a hobby, and it's a great hobby for me as a dabbler, but i don't think that it is an adequate replacement for college yet. %$* 549
there are a lot of reasons for this, but the number one reason for this is really just one word and that word is contact. %$* 549
ladies and gentlemen, i hope that you'll vote no on the motion: more clicks, fewer bricks: the lecture hall is obsolete, because more clicks means less contact, less contact with professors like me. %$* 549
i'm not a superstar. %$* 549
i'm not a celebrity. %$* 549
i'm not a millionaire. %$* 549
i don't even have tenure and i never will. %$* 549
but that doesn't matter to my students. %$* 549
i'm going to talk a little bit about some of my students today. %$* 549
i have one student who lives with dyslexia, and she is so smart in class. %$* 549
she's just bright in class, but her written work really suffers. %$* 549
and if she were taking an online course she might be mistaken quite unfairly for somebody who was not as bright as she is or drunk maybe, i don't know, but the fact that we can actually talk to each other in class has changed her life, because she knows that i know how smart she is. %$* 549
i have another student who is so shy that he shook last semester in class. %$* 549
whenever i called on him-- %$* 549
i have ways of getting students to pay attention, by the way. %$* 549
he shook when i called on him. %$* 549
he gave presentation and he actually stopped halfway through because he went so clammy. %$* 549
two weeks ago he came in, second semester, same class, dostoyevsky killed it. %$* 549
did such a great job. %$* 549
blew us all away and i was talking to him about his story because i wanted to use it today, and he said i want you to know that our class has helped me learn how to talk to people. %$* 549
the importance of that cannot be over-stated. %$* 549
it has helped him learn how to talk to people. %$* 549
so, people, my students, actual real people, i know them. %$* 549
they know me. %$* 549
i don’t just enter their lives with the dissemination of content. %$* 549
they enter mine and we connect, we make contact. %$* 549
and that's important when things are going well in class. %$* 549
it’s even more important when things are going poorly. %$* 549
the community college research center right here at columbia did a multi-year study where they determined that when students at community colleges and other sort of non-prestige institutions are struggling and they're taking classes online, they're much more likely to fail. %$* 549
they're much more likely to drop out. %$* 549
they're much more likely to give up. %$* 549
so i urge you to vote no on this motion: more clicks, fewer bricks, because with every click a student loses contact. %$* 549
with every click the student loses opportunities for growth. %$* 549
with every click the student might even lose their future. %$* 549
so right now students aren’t just failing online classes in enormous numbers, although they are. %$* 549
online classes are also failing them. %$* 549
i have a lot more to say on this, but i'd like to transition to discuss, but while i am i'm going to be thinking about my students who all waived their right to privacy for me to be able to shout out to them today. %$* 549
so i hope that like me you'll be thinking of miranda and emma and alex and alex and sarah, sarah, and sarah, kayla, amanda, katrina, megan, braxton, andy, dick, sandy, another rebecca, not me, josh, jake and james, taylor, ryan, elden and ethan, josie, and dimitri. %$* 549
i think that they deserve contact. %$* 549
i think they deserve devoted personal attention. %$* 549
moocs are great for dabbling, and they're great for supplementary education, but i don't think they're a substitute for human interaction. %$* 549
the minerva project sounds fascinating, and i heard that you were hiring. %$* 549
you probably pay more than i make. %$* 549
but no matter how advanced software is, i still don't think that it can replace face to face and being in the same room. %$* 549
interaction is the most important part of college. %$* 549

we always begin these debates by bringing out onto the stage the chairman of intelligence squared, bob rosenkranz, who frames this debate for us. %$* 13
so let's welcome to the stage robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
so we're just going to take a couple of minutes to explain why we're doing this debate. %$* 13
bob, why did this one get on our board for the season? %$* 13
well, the reason it's timely is that, of course, mitt romney lost an election that he might have won, given the state of the economy at the time, and because the republican national committee just published a 100-page report that was very self reflective about why they might have lost. %$* 1
so the republican party itself is putting this out there as a debate? %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 1
and the side that's arguing for some sort of shift to the middle, what points are they making? %$* 13
well, the point they're making is that the gop has alienated large parts of the potential electorate with, particularly, its stands on social issues, on things like gay marriage, women's freedom of choice, and immigration, and the thought is that those social parts of the gop agenda are just fatal to their success in national elections and need to be rethought. %$* 1
and the side arguing against it, what's the argument not to move to the center? %$* 13
well, i had a-- %$* 1
i actually posed the subject of tonight's resolution in a private chat with mitt romney a couple of weeks ago, and he said that he felt that there was simply no chance for a pro-choice republican to win the presidency, and the reason he felt that way was because the most reliable republican voters are evangelicals. %$* 1
they're about 80 percent republican. %$* 1
the counterweight to that is blacks and unions on the democrat side, but if the republican party alienates those people who are their most reliable supporters they just cannot win. %$* 1
so they without the base, they can't win? %$* 13
that's exactly what he was saying. %$* 1
all right, and that's straight from the candidate's mouth? %$* 13
right. %$* 1
now we're going to hear from four more mouths, our debaters. %$* 13
let's welcome them to the stage and thank bob rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i'd like to just invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making all of this possible. %$* 13
all possess, you and i, all of us here, something that the ambitious, and the powerful, and the wannabe powerful keenly covet, and that is our votes. %$* 13
the rules say that political parties cannot have power unless they first have our votes, and when they fail to get them, as the republican party did in sufficient numbers in the race to the white house in 2012, it inevitably sets off soul searching within the party. %$* 13
how did we fail to connect to the american voter? %$* 13
do we need to change to do better next time? %$* 13
that is the debate that's taking place right now inside the republican party, and we are bringing it out now onto this stage. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement, "the gop must seize the center or die," a debate from intelligence squared, u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for and against this motion. %$* 13
as always, our debate goes in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
on the side arguing for that motion, let's welcome david brooks, an op-ed columnist for the new york times. %$* 13
his partner is mickey edwards, a former u.s.congressman from oklahoma. %$* 13
the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
arguing against that motion, laura ingraham, host of “the laura ingraham show.” and her partner, ralph reed, founder and chairman of the faith and freedom coalition. %$* 13
our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
let's meet the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
first, ladies and gentlemen, david brooks. %$* 13
you are an op-ed columnist for the new york times. %$* 13
in that position, often referred to as a moderate, you get a lot of flack from both sides. %$* 13
a few examples, the conservative blogger, michelle malkin wrote of you that you are "the eddie haskell of the fourth estate." the liberal writer, jonathan chait writes that you are-- %$* 13
"david brooks is now totally pathological." my question to you, as somebody who's sort of getting it from both sides, does it hurt more when the zingers come from the left or the right to your bruised body? %$* 13
it hurts more when it comes from intelligent people. %$* 344
so that would be the right. %$* 344
thank you, david brooks. %$* 13
and, david-- %$* 13
that's my last one i'm giving you, laura. %$* 344
david, your partner is? %$* 13
the lovely and glamorous mickey edwards. %$* 344
ladies and gentlemen, mickey edwards. %$* 13
mickey, you served as chairman of the american conservative union. %$* 13
you are a founding trustee of the heritage foundation. %$* 13
you spent 16 years in congress as a member of the house republican leadership. %$* 13
that sounds pretty conservative. %$* 13
but if you ran for office today on the same platform you used to run on, would you be conservative enough to get nominated? %$* 13
are you kidding? %$* 345
i wouldn't get 5 percent of the vote. %$* 345
wow. %$* 13
that's pretty serious. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, we want to hear more about that in detail. %$* 13
mickey edwards, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
and here to argue against that motion, let's welcome first laura ingraham. %$* 13
laura, you host the eponymous show, “the laura ingraham show.” you were not happy with how the mitt romney campaign went in 2012.and you said quite plainly that election should have been a "gimme," given the situation in the economy, among other things. %$* 13
and you said this: "if you can't beat barack obama with that record, then shut down the party." how literally did you mean that? %$* 13
well, "shut down the party," as in, let's say a college basketball coach has a perpetually losing record. %$* 346
you don't then give the coach a raise. %$* 346
you get rid of the coach. %$* 346
so all of the people running the republican party, reince priebus, nice person. %$* 346
why are they still employed? %$* 346
and all the people in leadership should be gone, and we should have a new crop of people running it. %$* 346
what do you really think? %$* 13
that's what i think. %$* 346
ladies and gentlemen, laura ingraham. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 346
and, laura, your partner is? %$* 13
the ever-cutting-edge ralph reed. %$* 346
ladies and gentlemen, ralph reed. %$* 13
ralph, you're also arguing against this motion that the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
you are actually-- %$* 13
legitimately can claim to be part of american political history in the 20th century. %$* 13
you were the first executive director of the christian coalition. %$* 13
you are the founder and chairman now of the faith and freedom coalition. %$* 13
time magazine once named you "the right hand of god." mean, that's a very, very-- %$* 13
you know, very heavy-- %$* 13
they apparently didn't know that that seat was taken. %$* 347
ladies and gentlemen, ralph reed. %$* 13
our motion is, "the gop must seize the center or die." we go in three rounds of debate. %$* 13
before we do that, however, we have you, the live audience, vote to tell us what your view is on this motion as you come in off the street. %$* 13
if you go to those key pads at your seat, you can register your vote. %$* 13
if you are in support of this motion at this point, the gop must seize the center or die, press number one on your keypad. %$* 13
that means you're with this team at this point. %$* 13
if you're against, you're with this team, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you feel that you pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and the way this works, at the end of the debate, we have you do this again. %$* 13
and we get the results almost instantaneously. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage points will be declared the winner. %$* 13
onto round 1, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
arguing on this motion, the gop must seize the center or die, and here up to argue first in support of the motion, david brooks. %$* 13
he is an op-ed columnist for the new york times, a commentator on the “news hour with jim lehrer” and a former senior editor at the weekly standard. %$* 13
now, i did this once before, and the competitive juices got going, and i turned into an insufferable jerk attacking the other side. %$* 344
so before i do that, i want to just express my love and admiration for my opponents. %$* 344
we came into this business together, laura, the slowly aging portrait of ralph that he keeps in his attic, and i-- %$* 344
just complete admiration for them, the fact that they-- %$* 344
the democrats have hired them to burrow within the republican party and to destroy it from within, i do not hold against you. %$* 344
now, i admit i was on the left at one point. %$* 344
in the '60s, my parents took me to a "be in" where hippies would go just to be. %$* 344
and to demonstrate their liberation from money and material things, they threw their wallets into a garbage can. %$* 344
i was five. %$* 344
i saw a five dollar bill on fire in the garbage can. %$* 344
i ran into the fire, grabbed the money and ran away. %$* 344
and that was my first step over to the right in my life. %$* 344
kept going. %$* 344
but we had one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants, lower east side, a jewish kid trying to make it in the city. %$* 344
we had the attitude, the think yiddish act british attitude, "we'll fit in." we had the dream of making it in the city which meant making it in this neighborhood where we're standing, in the upper west side, the upper east side. %$* 344
and that was the-- %$* 344
how the republican party was started. %$* 344
it was started by abraham lincoln, a poor boy in illinois who wanted to make it. %$* 344
and he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility. %$* 344
he created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads. %$* 344
he got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, homestead act, land-grant college act, even introduced the income tax. %$* 344
it was using government to give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed. %$* 344
and that was still around when i got there, when i got to washington. %$* 344
ronald reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed. %$* 344
reagan did it. %$* 344
is the republican party doing it now? %$* 344
i think they have not because they've been so hostile to government. %$* 344
ronald reagan was more pragmatic than the current republican party. %$* 344
it's also no longer 1980.now if you want to rise and succeed, it's not enough just to work hard and row a boat across the ohio river like lincoln. %$* 344
think of a poor girl who wants to be like lincoln today. %$* 344
she can't just work hard ferrying people across that river. %$* 344
she grows up probably without a father. %$* 344
she grows up in a chaotic community with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds. %$* 344
to succeed, she's probably going to need some language instruction. %$* 344
she's probably going to need some early-- %$* 344
some protection from early childhood distresses that'll destroy her self-control. %$* 344
she's going to need institutions that'll help her build relationships so she can use people as tools for learning throughout life. %$* 344
she's probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job. %$* 344
and so what does the republican party today have to say to her? %$* 344
almost nothing. %$* 344
this party is encased in a simplistic and archaic metric, government versus the market. %$* 344
government bad, the market good. %$* 344
if you're an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your central pain. %$* 344
if you're that little girl, the government is not your big problem. %$* 344
if you're that little girl, the government, through pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping you work hard and becoming a better capitalist. %$* 344
does the republican party offer anything? %$* 344
no, which is why asian americans, for example, voted against the republican party three times to one. %$* 344
the republican party has become so hostile to government that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer. %$* 344
so hostile to government they can't really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with. %$* 344
and so this is a party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its founding principle. %$* 344
and the country knows that. %$* 344
republicans have lost five out of the last six popular votes in the elections. %$* 344
they've lost the senate. %$* 344
they should have won. %$* 344
they held onto the house by force of redistricting. %$* 344
the republican party has a 33 percent overall approval rating when the democrats have 47 percent. %$* 344
you take every rising group in america. %$* 344
the republican party is losing that group. %$* 344
latinos, by 4 to 1.asian americans, by 3 to 1.african americans, by 9 to 1.people in single households by 2 to 1.they're getting slaughtered among young people. %$* 344
if this electorate, and the electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men-- %$* 344
white men, the party would be doing awesome. %$* 344
this party is not that party. %$* 344
this party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white america that's never coming back and has to move to recapture that. %$* 344
it has-- %$* 344
and what is the people's top criticism of the republican party? %$* 344
recent gallup poll this week, the top criticism is they do not compromise. %$* 344
so this is a party going down the drain. %$* 344
it's a party that's unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns, apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration. %$* 344
bob bennett of utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the senate for working with a democrat. %$* 344
i had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the senate - - terrified of getting primaried from the right. %$* 344
unwilling to have any flexibility. %$* 344
becoming an uncompromising party. %$* 344
to me, this is a party that has to tackle two big issues. %$* 344
the first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable. %$* 344
the second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that charles murray writes about. %$* 344
and my advice to the republican party: don't move to the center for the sake of moving to the center. %$* 344
the center is nothing. %$* 344
move to the center for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility. %$* 344
do right by that little girl and you'll do right by yourself politically. %$* 344
and that means having a positive agenda. %$* 344
it means being more flexible. %$* 344
it means being prudent and sensible, not a party of a red rump of america. %$* 344
and so, i don't necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism. %$* 344
but i want to call them back to their essence as a party. %$* 344
and so, i ask you to vote for the proposition. %$* 344
thank you. %$* 344
thank you, david brooks. %$* 13
our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
and now here to argue against the motion, ralph reed. %$* 13
ralph reed is the founder and chairman of the faith & freedom coalition and former executive director of the christian coalition. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ralph reed. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 347
it's great to be here on the upper west side of manhattan, or as i like to refer to it, my mission field. %$* 347
i feel a little bit more at home since i got to walk past lincoln center. %$* 347
makes me feel a little more at home to know that a republican president has something named after him in this part of town. %$* 347
and you know, it's good to be here with mickey edwards and david brooks, who was often referred to in republican ranks as “obama's favorite conservative.” and i'm looking forward to a very lively and spirited debate. %$* 347
you know, i think for those of us who grew up in this party-- %$* 347
and i knocked on doors and walked precincts in my first campaign for a republican candidate, 35 years ago-- %$* 347
we've seen this movie before. %$* 347
virtually everything that david just said from that podium would have been said in 1949 after dewey lost. %$* 347
it would have been said in 1965 after barry goldwater lost. %$* 347
it was said in 1977 after ford lost. %$* 347
it's been said every time the republicans lose a major election. %$* 347
and i would just say, paraphrasing mark twain, “when it comes to the republican party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.”and in fact, i would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that david cited, the republican party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in decades. %$* 347
and if you don't believe me, i'll walk you through the statistics. %$* 347
first of all, look where the republican party was after hoover and the depression: 36 in the senate, 117 in the house. %$* 347
look where they were after nixon and watergate, after those devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure. %$* 347
and the party's brand then was even lower than it is now. %$* 347
36 in the senate, 144 in the house. %$* 347
even after george h.w.bush, after his defeat by bill clinton, the worst defeat, by the way, for an incumbent president since hoover in 1932.the republicans at that point stood at 44 in the senate and only 166 in the house. %$* 347
you compare that to today where they have 30 governors compared to the democrats' 20, and there's no question that the republican governors, whether it's nikki haley in south carolina. %$* 347
or scott walker in wisconsin, or bobby jindal in louisiana, or chris christie in new jersey are among the most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country, reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising taxes. %$* 347
the same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level. %$* 347
and the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level. %$* 347
the republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010.they controlled both houses of 24 legislatures to only 13 for the democrats. %$* 347
so i tell you what the democrats are going to find out. %$* 347
they're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a lot of fun. %$* 347
for eisenhower, it was the recession, sputnik, and a heart attack. %$* 347
for nixon, it was watergate and vietnam. %$* 347
for clinton, it was impeachment. %$* 347
for reagan, it was the loss of the senate, and ideological control of the house in '86, and iran contra. %$* 347
and, of course, george w.bush, katrina, and iraq. %$* 347
second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's only been one president in the post-world war ii period who won house seats in his second off year election as a two-term president, and that was bill clinton in 1998. %$* 347
so just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries. %$* 347
i'll quote you one from 1993.this was by the then outgoing rnc chairman, and he said, "we should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and dying past." sixteen months later, the republicans gained control of the house and senate for the first time in 40 years. %$* 347
my second point would be we've tried this before. %$* 347
this formula's been applied. %$* 347
if you don't believe me, go to california, a state that once produced nixon, reagan, and other great conservatives. %$* 347
they moved to the mushy middle. %$* 347
they nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro- choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate. %$* 347
and today it is fair to say that the republican party stands on the verge of extinction, having followed these same policies that are being recommended now. %$* 347
only 25 out of 80 in the california assembly are republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state senate, following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally. %$* 347
and the other thing i would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie. %$* 347
if the republican party walks away from core conservative convictions-- %$* 347
remember that 27 percent of the electorate is self-identified evangelical christian, 10 percent are frequently mass- attending, pro-life, pro-family catholics. %$* 347
they voted 75 to 25 percent for mitt romney. %$* 347
that constituency is larger than the african-american vote, the hispanic vote, and the union vote combined. %$* 347
and if this party retreats from those core conservative principles, those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the republican party will become the whig party. %$* 347
one last thing because i'm running out of time. %$* 347
i'm an old high school and collegiate debater. %$* 347
defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate. %$* 347
and remember what this resolution says. %$* 347
it says the republican party must seize the center, that is to say become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the democrats are, basically become a democrat light, or it will die. %$* 347
it doesn't say, "lose elections.” it doesn't say, "under perform among minorities." it says, "it will die." now, based on what i have just told you about the state of the republican party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution. %$* 347
thank you very much. %$* 347
ralph reed, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s. debate where our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing both for and against. %$* 13
you have heard the first two opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
to debate for this motion that the gop must seize the center or die, a former eight-term republican congressman from oklahoma, vice president of the aspen institute and a founding trustee of the heritage foundation, ladies and gentlemen, mickey edwards. %$* 13
john, thank you. %$* 345
well, it's a great privilege to be able to be here at intelligence squared. %$* 345
thank you very much for doing this. %$* 345
it's great to be here with my friend, david brooks, and also to be here with my friends laura ingraham and ralph reed who have devoted so much of their lives to fighting for principles they believe in. %$* 345
and i admire them both. %$* 345
i hope they lose badly, but i admire them both. %$* 345
i think the question here tonight is-- %$* 345
to put it even more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country well? %$* 345
and if they do not, if they do not stand for where america is and where america is going, what claim can they make for support from the american people who find a party that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is going to elect america's political leaders for years to come? %$* 345
the fact is, ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from. %$* 345
it's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become. %$* 345
let me be clear. %$* 345
i do not think the problem is that the republican party is conservative. %$* 345
the problem is that what it advocates-- %$* 345
what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what american conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of ronald reagan, who almost definitely could not win a republican primary today. %$* 345
it's not consistent with the days when the republican party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be. %$* 345
i spent a good many years championing the republican party and conservatism. %$* 345
among the other things, besides chairing the american conservative union and the conservative political action conference, i chaired ronald reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election. %$* 345
and i have watched this country change, and i have watched the republican party also change in the opposite direction. %$* 345
americans still agree with conservative principles. %$* 345
they defend the right of citizens to own guns. %$* 345
but they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches. %$* 345
the people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes. %$* 345
you know, ralph quoted people like bobby jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the republican party. %$* 345
the people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government, they say, “no, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase,” who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil. %$* 345
you know, i'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work. %$* 345
and without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it. %$* 345
real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes. %$* 345
and yet today's republican party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe. %$* 345
so we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that ralph made. %$* 345
what does it mean to move to the center? %$* 345
i would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as ralph and laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works. %$* 345
and in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one america. %$* 345
that's what the american people don't see. %$* 345
that's what the american people do not see in today's republican party. %$* 345
so people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the republican party attracts and nominates for office. %$* 345
will it doom the republican party? %$* 345
you saw barack obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected. %$* 345
laura has written that it's mitt romney's fault. %$* 345
why did mitt romney do things that alienated the people? %$* 345
it's the only way you can win a republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did. %$* 345
the-- %$* 345
and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the republican party to win control of the senate. %$* 345
everybody thought we would win control. %$* 345
democrats were going to lose control of the senate. %$* 345
in fact, they gained seats. %$* 345
why did they gain seats? %$* 345
because republicans put up candidates that allowed democrats to win the senate seats in delaware, nevada, missouri, indiana, who-- %$* 345
those were states where people were inclined to think good of republicans, but they just could not go there. %$* 345
so the other question is what it means to be a political party. %$* 345
and it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of america. %$* 345
so what's really at stake here are two things: whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising republican party can survive, and second, whether it should. %$* 345
the republican party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it, my party, will disappear, and it should. %$* 345
please vote for the proposition. %$* 345
thank you, mickey edwards. %$* 13
our motion is "the gop must seize the center or die." and now to speak as our final debater against the motion, laura ingraham. %$* 13
she is host of “the laura ingraham show.” she is a contributor on the fox news channel and also is a best-selling author. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, laura ingraham. %$* 13
great to be here. %$* 346
and i have deep admiration for all of my co-panelist debaters. %$* 346
no snarky comments. %$* 346
all of them contribute to the dialogue, and i really appreciate the opportunity to be here. %$* 346
last-- %$* 346
on saturday, i was at the nra 500. do you guys know what that is? %$* 346
anyone in manhattan know-- %$* 346
it was a nascar race in dallas. %$* 346
what a great country it is. %$* 346
i could be at the nra 500, be here with you today. %$* 346
is there any crossover audience, any people-- %$* 346
oh, none. %$* 346
darn. %$* 346
i'm totally losing already. %$* 346
i'm a duck out of-- %$* 346
i'm a duck out of water, okay? %$* 346
i'm really a duck out of water here because for me, a centrist is someone who owns only two guns. %$* 346
oh, come on. %$* 346
i have a question, if this thing is tied by the end, does the supreme court actually pick the winner like in 2000? %$* 346
can we actually get justice scalia to write the opinion? %$* 346
i have to say that debating with david brooks and mickey edwards, the politics-- %$* 346
david brooks, an esteemed columnist for the new york times, in new york is like-- %$* 346
it's like barack obama debating wayne lapierre about gun control at a gun show, okay? %$* 346
the odds are definitely stacked against us. %$* 346
but you must vote against this proposition. %$* 346
a couple of points first to mickey's argument. %$* 346
if mickey's argument is correct, then one would think that in the bluest of states, which would be very hospitable to moderate republican views, quote, "centrist views," people like scott brown would be victorious. %$* 346
scott brown obviously went down in flames. %$* 346
one would think that someone like the very centrist tommy thompson of wisconsin would have won his senate seat. %$* 346
unfortunately tommy thompson, thought of as a middle-of- the-road republican, went down in flames. %$* 346
republicans had their issues, but for every todd aiken and richard murdoch, i can cite a republican moderate who could not make the grade. %$* 346
the proposition should be rejected because moderate republicanism, going to this mythical center, has been tried, and it has failed repeatedly. %$* 346
last two elections. %$* 346
the republican party already died. %$* 346
it died in 2000 with the elite's choice, which was john mccain. %$* 346
remember, back then, mitt romney was the insurgent candidate. %$* 346
i supported mitt romney in 2008. %$* 346
he was going up against john mccain, who was for immigration reform. %$* 346
he worked for ted kennedy on a bunch of issues. %$* 346
he was for mccain-feingold. %$* 346
john mccain was the media's favorite republican. %$* 346
john mccain went down in flames. %$* 346
move forward to the last election. %$* 346
everyone said, “the only guy who could beat barack obama would be mitt romney. %$* 346
couldn't be that rick santorum. %$* 346
certainly couldn't be newt gingrich.” gosh, jon huntsman, the other moderate republican, he got no traction. %$* 346
lo and behold, mitt romney ran. %$* 346
mitt romney lost. %$* 346
moderates usually lose elections with few exceptions. %$* 346
and before you pull out the “chris christie is a moderate and everybody loves him” example, let me tell you what the new york times said about chris christie in 2009: chris christie, described as plainly conservative on issues such as school choice, rolling back regulations, and very restrictionist on abortion. %$* 346
chris christie won the governorship of new jersey with the help of people like yours truly, the early tea party and conservatives. %$* 346
he was no middle-of-the-road centrist when he won. %$* 346
the proposition should be rejected for another reason. %$* 346
the mythical center. %$* 346
the proposition misunderstands what the word center means. %$* 346
think about this. %$* 346
you don't seize the center. %$* 346
you create the center. %$* 346
think about this. %$* 346
george bush saying that conservatives should be more compassionate. %$* 346
or marco rubio saying that you have to agree with chuck schumer on immigration. %$* 346
you say that. %$* 346
i don't know what you-- %$* 346
what you've seen, but to me, it seems a little bit more weak than you would have seemed if you just said, “you know, these are my views. %$* 346
take them or leave them.” but barack obama-- %$* 346
did he seize the center in, let's say, 1994? %$* 346
when newt gingrich was changing the face of republican politics in 1994 or when ronald reagan was triumphantly winning elections in the 1980s, did young barack obama say to himself, “gosh, i've got to seize the center. %$* 346
i've got to move and adopt a new point of view, and a new tone, and a new idea, because guess what? %$* 346
conservatism is all the rage. %$* 346
unilateral disarmament is out the window. %$* 346
i need to seize the center.” of course he didn't do that. %$* 346
and he was very smart not to do that. %$* 346
constantly changing viewpoints are a fact of life in the united states. %$* 346
they usually change when someone makes a coherent, strong argument that the status quo is unacceptable, that the policies that are being advocated by the other side actually don't help the american people. %$* 346
so that to say, “seize the center or die” doesn't mean anything. %$* 346
i can remember when the center was the defense of marriage act. %$* 346
barack obama believed in that centrist position. %$* 346
so did bill clinton. %$* 346
so did hillary clinton. %$* 346
so did most americans. %$* 346
the left found a new way to approach it and guess what? %$* 346
the center changed. %$* 346
i can remember when the center position was for the war in iraq. %$* 346
david was a big supporter of the war in iraq, as was i. but guess what? %$* 346
facts changed. %$* 346
circumstances changed. %$* 346
arguments changed. %$* 346
the center changed. %$* 346
does that mean that people who had a principled view about the war in iraq should seize the center and just admit that the war in iraq was wrong? %$* 346
if that happened and, david, you wrote that column, i must have missed that. %$* 346
the proposition should be rejected because it misunderstands what a political party is. %$* 346
mickey touched on this-- %$* 346
and i agree with him on this point. %$* 346
a political party doesn't exist just to get elected, right? %$* 346
a political party exists to make people's lives better. %$* 346
edmund burke-- %$* 346
i'm sure a lot of fans of burke out there. %$* 346
but edmund burke said that, “look. %$* 346
a political party is to implement certain agreed on principles. %$* 346
and by the way, it should-- %$* 346
you should reject the entreaties of the elites who will urge you to change your principles to fit the mood of the day.”we saw, time and again, people who come across as flip-floppers. %$* 346
they want to change their views for political convenience. %$* 346
and time and again, those people are rejected as candidates. %$* 346
a party does not exist to win elections. %$* 346
if it did, then guess what? %$* 346
we would have a different scenario today in the united states, because, guess what? %$* 346
flip- floppers don't win. %$* 346
would anyone have agreed that the center position of-- %$* 346

—in the country. %$* 243
so we are going out and looking for enormous talent. %$* 243
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. absolutely and we should pay them— %$* 242
but, i am— %$* 243
—enormous salaries— %$* 242
—a professor as you know, and in every class there is a tail of about 30 percent, who really should never have been admitted but somehow managed to get in. %$* 243
everywhere. %$* 243
i’ve taught at mit, i’ve taught at columbia— %$* 243
where— %$* 242
—everywhere it’s the same, but, i would just say one thing. %$* 243
which is that there are people, who could be employed but who are kind of at the bottom end, they’re not really comparable to the kinds of people we are going out and getting. %$* 243
and so i think the nation prospers by having those people come in, create jobs, because it’s not a given number of jobs that we are talking about. %$* 243
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. and i think the other people will find their own way, in jobs which are more appropriate to their qualifications— %$* 243
but that’s, that’s illegal immigration— %$* 242
and we’ll take another question from the gentleman who’s standing with the microphone— audience member (male) yes. %$* 13
let’s stipulate that the effect of impeding lower-cost goods, is higher prices for goods, tires, pickup trucks, et cetera, in fact that is the purpose of protectionist policies on their face is to, prop up prices, in turn, propping up wages. %$* 13
what is the—and this is the three gentleman on that side. %$* 13
what is the ethical— %$* 13
i just want to point out, you’re addressing your question to the team arguing against the motion— audience member (male) okay, sorry, that’s right— %$* 13
—that buy american will backfire— audience member (male) against the motion, that’s correct. %$* 13
what is the ethical justification, for transferring money from the broad american population, to workers in specific industries, which is again rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. inarguably the cost of im— the effect of impeding lower-cost imports. %$* 13
the problem with your question, i’ll keep it short so that the others can get a chance. %$* 242
this is leo gerard speaking. %$* 13
the problem with your question is you don’t get to the point of how did we so-called end up with lower cost. %$* 242
if we end up instead of paying a living wage we’re paying less than a living wage, if we’re giving cheap money and extra subsidies, if we’re giving tax dollars to export credits when they export, if we’re not enforcing safety standards, if we’re not enforcing environmental standards, you could send me anywhere and give me those rules and i can develop the cheapest product. %$* 242
but what’s the moral right. %$* 242
and in this case what we’ve been doing, what we are doing today, is we’re taking american dollars, and we’re sending them to %$* 242
that is the same kind of argument— %$* 246
jeff madrick— %$* 13
—that was used against labor unionization, throughout american economic history. %$* 246
what is the ethical argument for raising wages above some supposed, and i would argue hypothetical market rate of wages. %$* 246
the fact is, the assumption behind—and i see you smiling there. %$* 246
the assumption, behind your comment is that these markets work very well, reflect cost, that people without labor unions to continue that analogy, will always get what they’re worth, and everybody will do well. %$* 246
it’s just not unfortunately the way it works, it works maybe in your classroom. %$* 246
but it doesn’t work in the real world, and along— %$* 246
can i—— %$* 245
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz, i just want to say, you moved this thing downtown and it really gets spicy. %$* 13
we’re rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.now in the home stretch and in a very short time you, the audience, will be deciding who has won this debate. %$* 13
but i want to recall that at the beginning we asked you whether you agreed or disagreed with our motion that: buy american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
at the beginning fifty-seven percent of you agreed with the motion. %$* 13
twenty percent disagreed and twenty- three percent were undecided. %$* 13
in just a few minutes we’ll be asking you for a final time and your response is going to determine the winner. %$* 13
but first we want to start round three, closing statements. %$* 13
in this case, two minutes each for each speaker. %$* 13
each speaker has a short summary statement. %$* 13
it’s their last chance to change your minds. %$* 13
our motion, once again, is: buy american/hire american policies will backfire. %$* 13
and speaking against our motion and summing up, leo gerard, international president of the united steel workers. %$* 13
leo. %$* 13
my point is. %$* 242
my point will be very brief. %$* 242
that during the period of time that we’ve adopted the philosophy that the other side is defending – and you can’t defend that without talking about the issues of trade overall. %$* 242
and during the period of time that we’ve entered into that blind drive to that kind of a trade and investment ideology and manufacturing, america has gone from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world’s largest debtor nation. %$* 242
wages of average americans have rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. stagnated and fallen, that the industrial strength of america has gone from being sapped, uh, at twenty-eight percent at one time, now down to nine percent. %$* 242
we’ve had an accumulated trade debt that no one on the other side has tried to defend, of six and a half trillion dollars. %$* 242
some of you in the room may know what a billion is. %$* 242
how many of you know what a trillion is? %$* 242
think about this: a billion seconds is roughly the nineteen. %$* 242
late 1950s. %$* 242
a billion minutes ago, christ was on earth. %$* 242
a billion hours ago we lived in caves. %$* 242
and in the period since 1994 we’ve accumulated a six and a half trillion dollar trade debt. %$* 242
we’ve hollowed out our economy to the point now where you’ve got the chinese will probably raise at the g20 whether or not we should move to another form of currency because the american dollar is not sustainable. %$* 242
i think that the way we do that is we develop a strategy that’s going to rebuild the american industrial base and we have to do that by focusing, not just on subsidies but innovation, creativity and demanding that our trading partners level the playing field. %$* 242
and we’re not going to be able to win against unfair trade and we shouldn’t pretend we can. %$* 242
leo gerard, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
summarizing for the motion: buy american/hire rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. american policies will backfire, here is douglas irwin, professor of economics at dartmouth college. %$* 13
well, first of all, just in terms of the proposition before the house, i think they have backfired. %$* 241
i think that’s demonstrable. %$* 241
i think you have no choice but to vote affirmative. %$* 241
but let me make some major concessions to the other side. %$* 241
i think what you’re hearing is things we’ve heard in the 1980s. %$* 241
we’ve actually even heard them in the 1950s and beforehand-- %$* 241
and that is that economic change is very hard and very painful and we should do something to address that. %$* 241
i happen to think that the remedies they’re suggesting are wrong, will backfire and actually don’t really address the underlying problem. %$* 241
we’ve talked about the declining share of workers in manufacturing. %$* 241
manufacturing is a victim of its own success. %$* 241
a century ago a third of the work force in the united states was in agriculture. %$* 241
now it’s about two percent. %$* 241
why? %$* 241
because the productivity of the american farmers is absolutely astronomical. %$* 241
the same thing has happened with american factories. %$* 241
they’re churning out stuff and we just need fewer workers. %$* 241
they’re much more capital intensive as productivity. %$* 241
think about manchester, new hampshire. %$* 241
i’m from new hampshire. %$* 241
if you’ve ever been to visit manchester-- %$* 241
lovely city, huge brick building, over a mile long, former textile mill. %$* 241
not a single shoe, not a single textile made there anymore. %$* 241
it’s a thriving city. %$* 241
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.it wasn’t always thriving and it went through some very difficult times. %$* 241
but it made that change. %$* 241
it had to. %$* 241
the jobs actually were stolen by the south, not by a foreign country. %$* 241
and then they left for the south for other countries. %$* 241
jeff madrick said, you know, i’m tired of hearing about people saying trade doesn’t, you don’t lose jobs. %$* 241
actually, i’ll give you a copy of my book, because in one of the chapters i say, first thing, trade destroys jobs. %$* 241
trade also creates jobs. %$* 241
but there’s no denying that trade destroys jobs and certainly in poor, competing industries. %$* 241
but it creates jobs elsewhere. %$* 241
the question is the balance. %$* 241
guess what? %$* 241
technology destroys jobs. %$* 241
what’s happened to all the bank tellers? %$* 241
what’s happened to all the secretaries? %$* 241
do we stop technology? %$* 241
no, we have to adjust to it and become a better society for it. %$* 241
i do believe the trade deficit is a problem. %$* 241
but it’s not mercantilism of china or what have you. %$* 241
china is very poor but their savings rate. %$* 241
what was the personal savings rate in the united states? %$* 241
douglas irwin-- %$* 13
zero. %$* 241
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. douglas irwin, your time is up. %$* 13
but they can save in china. %$* 241
thank you. %$* 241
summarizing against the motion that: buy american/hire american policies will backfire, john r. macarthur, known as rick macarthur, president and publisher of harper’s magazine. %$* 13
very quickly, there are lots of anecdotal examples of de- automation in outsourcing, by the way, professor irwin, where products that used to be made on automated assembly lines in the united states are now being made by hand in mexico and china. %$* 244
but i’ll put that aside and just say that i finally get to my main point, and get away from the statistics, and point out to you that japan and china don’t believe in free trade any more than i do. %$* 244
and if we don’t start buying american soon or doing something, installing some kind of compensatory tariffs, buy american provisions-- %$* 244
and i’ll acknowledge to the other side that the tariff such as it is has been corruptly applied throughout the decades and the centuries that we’ve had it. %$* 244
but that generally speaking, there has to be some kind of compensation for american policy that has favored the production of things that used to made here by cheap labor in foreign countries where you rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. cannot organize a union and you have no environmental protection agency. %$* 244
but even if you don’t feel an ethical obligation to your fellow citizens or to the poor workers working for thirty cents an hour in china or a dollar twenty-five an hour in mexico, even if you have no concern, ethical concern about them, i urge you to come over to our side, vote for our side out of enlightened self-interest. %$* 244
because if we don’t do something to compensate for these pro- cheap labor, pro-outsourcing policies we’ve been pursuing for the last twenty years particularly-- %$* 244
but really since the war-- %$* 244
we’re going to end up with a political vacuum that will be filled not by a nice, civilized businessman like ross perot, but by a very ugly rightwing populist. %$* 244
it’s already brewing in the united states. %$* 244
and if you don’t hurry up and do something about it, there won’t be any discussion about free trade anymore. %$* 244
there’s going to be only discussion about how to shut the doors to immigration and how to keep the labor unions from organizing immigrants, for example. %$* 244
thank, thank you, john macarthur. %$* 13
summarizing for the motion in this intelligence rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. squared debate where our motion is: buy american/hire american policies will backfire, jagdish bhagwati, university professor, economics and law at columbia university. %$* 13
let me first focus on buy american provisions because that’s really what the motion is about. %$* 243
and there i would just simply say that while immediately you see that you’re saving some jobs, you’re losing many more because of the downstream effects, retaliation effects, diffusion or protectionism effects. %$* 243
by the time you’ve added it up, you’re losing far more than you’re gaining. %$* 243
and i think it’s just being penny wise and pound foolish. %$* 243
and that’s the fundamental point we need to understand. %$* 243
the second point relates to the more general issue of protectionism which has come up from the other side. %$* 243
i think certainly, mr. %$* 243
gerard, and i think to some extent, the other people on the other side, have been focusing on the fear that trade has actually putting downward pressure on the wages of our workers. %$* 243
as a democrat, i’m certainly concerned about it and i think most people are concerned about it. %$* 243
i mean, these are the bottom thirty percent of our society and we ought to worry about them. %$* 243
the only question is whether protectionism is the answer. %$* 243
and i think what is going on basically is that massive technological change is going on, and i think we need to worry about that and how to adapt to that. %$* 243
and if we don’t do that we’re not going to get an, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. appropriate answer to the problem. %$* 243
you take acute technological change going on assembly lines. %$* 243
entire assembly lines are wiped out. %$* 243
if you’re going to see, you know, take your child to see charlie chaplin’s modern times and they say that he goes berserk on the assembly line and they say, can you take me to see an assembly line? %$* 243
well, you can but you won’t see charlie chaplin there. %$* 243
you will see five people in a cage up there. %$* 243
so what has happened is that large numbers of jobs have been lost and you’re getting more volatility as a result, for the unskilled workers. %$* 243
and we have to really rethink the whole issue of how we accommodate the institutional change to be able to support workers, but protectionism is not the answer. %$* 243
thank you very much. %$* 13
summarizing his position against our motion, jeff madrick, senior fellow at the schwartz center for economic policy analysis at the new school. %$* 13
jeff madrick. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 246
the first narrow motion, buy american/hire american will not have a reverse impact. %$* 246
it’s a rather small issue. %$* 246
what it will do is allow our stimulus to work effectively. %$* 246
that is our first priority. %$* 246
the way it’s now structured, our stimulus to get ourselves out of this recession, will leak badly rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.overseas. %$* 246
that’s the principle issue. %$* 246
the opposition has talked about how it will inevitably cost jobs that use simple, people over there think it will save jobs in the near term. %$* 246
but if you thought about it for a second or two you’d realize there are second, third and fourth order effects. %$* 246
the fact is that both theory and most empirical studies suggest that more jobs are lost than the opposition is acknowledging. %$* 246
in fact, on balance the theory says a significant portion of jobs or wages are lost in this kind of situation. %$* 246
in balance, the whole wage package may be higher but the distribution of those wages changes. %$* 246
now, free market theory is very compelling. %$* 246
it is a simple and pretty ideology. %$* 246
for the most part, the opposition has put forward this theory. %$* 246
and i think, judging by some of the questions, many of you believe it out there-- %$* 246
that efficient markets exist. %$* 246
i’m a little surprised i hear so much out there, given the financial crisis because we were told time and again that bonuses made sense, that securitization made sense, that even some people-- %$* 246
like alan greenspan, and to some degree, ben bernanke-- %$* 246
told us high house prices make sense. %$* 246
they resorted to the same kind of thinking that is behind this idea that we just let markets work and sort it out. %$* 246
the way to respond to change is through active government working with business, active incentives. %$* 246
and this kind of argument has rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. diminished our ability to do that in america. %$* 246
thank you, jeff madrick. %$* 13
and finally, speaking for the motion: buy american/hire american policies will backfire, here is susan schwab, former u.s. trade representative. %$* 13
but the other side has sort of been bobbing and weaving about the topic on the debate. %$* 245
so i’m forced to address just a couple of issues here on the ethics of open trade. %$* 245
the fact that there have been six hundred million people brought out of poverty in china and india, in part because they have opened their markets over the last two decades, i think is a very strong positive note, how important trade can be and they’re potential new customers of ours. %$* 245
we remain the single largest manufacturer in the world. %$* 245
we want to be selling those turbines, those earth movers, that transportation equipment, the aircraft. %$* 245
it’s very, very important. %$* 245
and we care as much about u.s.jobs as the other side. %$* 245
however, not a single solitary one of the arguments that they have made would create a single job. %$* 245
and in fact, if you look at the proposition here, the proposition here would destroy-- %$* 245
buy american/hire american policies we have been able to show, without question-- %$* 245
would destroy more jobs than it would create. %$* 245
it sounds patriotic. %$* 245
in fact, buy american/hire american rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.policies hurt america, hurt americans. %$* 245
there is zero evidence of any country ever using economic isolationism and buy national policies to achieve and sustain economic development. %$* 245
someone mentioned japan. %$* 245
i remember twenty years ago, thirty years ago these same folks were telling us the japanese were going to wipe out all our manufacturing. %$* 245
we are still, by far, the largest manufacturer in the world. %$* 245
we are the largest exporter in the world. %$* 245
there are millions of u.s.jobs that depend on these exports and that includes exports that we can and should and will be making to foreign countries that have stimulus packages. %$* 245
clearly, the vote has to be on which side has convinced you that the policies will create more jobs and more opportunities for americans. %$* 245
clearly, that is a vote in the alternative because buy american policies have and have already failed. %$* 245
thank you, susan schwab. %$* 13
and that concludes the debating portion of our program. %$* 13
it is now time to learn who has won this debate. %$* 13
we want to ask you to take out your cell phones again and turn them on, briefly. %$* 13
it works the same way as before. %$* 13
you text to the number 99503.for the motion you vote iqyes.if you’re against the motion you vote iqno.if you remain undecided or became undecided, you vote iqundecided.and i’ll give you a couple of minutes cause i hear the phones just starting up. %$* 13
the instructions are rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.clear to everyone, i assume. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
is anyone not done? %$* 13
all right, a lot of people still. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
what’s happening? %$* 13
it says you already voted? %$* 13
is anyone else having that problem, that it’s coming back to you that you voted already? %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
it said to call back, leave a message? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
all right, and if you can shut your cell phones down again. %$* 13
to the individuals-- %$* 13
and i think it’s just a few-- %$* 13
for whom it’s glitching, we apologize. %$* 13
we will smooth it out. %$* 13
okay? %$* 13
so dana, i’m assuming we’re locking it out? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
voting is over. %$* 13
so we’re going to have the vote in just a moment. %$* 13
but before we do so, first of all, once again, this was a very zesty conversation. %$* 13
i really want to thank both, both of our panels. %$* 13
looking forward as series four continues, i want to point out that our next debate will be next month-- %$* 13
tuesday, october 6th. %$* 13
the motion will be: america cannot and will not succeed in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 13
we are still booking this,.and here’s who we have booked so far: panelists for the motion are retired u.s.military intelligence and army special forces officer patrick lang and ralph peters, a retired army officer and author; against the motion are president of the new america foundation and author of the bin ladens, steve coll. %$* 13
and he is one of the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.authors of the u.s.army’s counterinsurgency field manual, retired officer and president of the center for a new american century, john nagl and former assistant secretary of defense for asia, james shin. %$* 13
all of our debates will continue to be heard on more than a hundred and ninety npr stations across the country and to that point, when i announce the final results, the second vote results, i’m going to raise my hand and ask you to applause to give us a rousing conclusion to our radio broadcast. %$* 13
but we are also on television throughout this season, on bloomberg television. %$* 13
you can watch all of the fall debates on bloomberg and read about them also with our other partner, newsweek. %$* 13
the results of this debate and the content of the debate will be summarized and analyzed in the next edition of newsweek. %$* 13
books by tonight’s panelists and dvds of past debates are on sale in the lobby but jeff gets a free one from doug, right? %$* 13
that would be unfair. %$* 32
ah heh. %$* 13
i should have read it, though. %$* 32
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. all right, is everybody settled down? %$* 13
and i have the results in and our concluding numbers are these: when you came in and voted beforehand, fifty-seven percent of you were for the motion, twenty percent of you were against and seventy-three percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, seventy-two percent are for, fourteen percent against, fourteen percent undecided. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion wins. %$* 13
congratulations to that team. %$* 13
thank you for me, john donvan, for intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13

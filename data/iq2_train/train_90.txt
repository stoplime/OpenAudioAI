and that's really what we're arguing for with this proposition. %$* 306
and we should add that-- %$* 304
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
the other side has not really addressed this whole very striking example of the swift program, where the times revealed an ongoing operational intelligence-gathering program directed at al-qaeda's finances. %$* 304
and it's true that the treasury secretary had mentioned that, in general terms, we were tracking their finances. %$* 304
but it certainly, until that story appeared in-- %$* 304
so you put this out three times. %$* 13
one chance to respond. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 18
do you want to respond, was the times wrong to report on the swift program? %$* 13
was anything gained from public interest? %$* 13
the times was not wrong to report on it because the swift program had been written about in many forms over many years before and after al-qaeda became a significant source and issue. %$* 307
that is the only way international transactions flow and get cleared. %$* 307
and it was obvious to anybody who had read anything in any detail about how international transactions are going that that's where they go through. %$* 307
but let's assume for a moment-- %$* 305
alan dershowitz. %$* 13
that the times was wrong. %$* 305
you didn't prosecute the times. %$* 305
you don't have the guts to prosecute the times. %$* 305
you will never prosecute the times. %$* 305
i actually do. %$* 306
you were a bunch of bullies. %$* 305
you would go after-- %$* 305
you said you agree with that, mike? %$* 13
only the weakest and the most vulnerable. %$* 305
no, actually, i-- %$* 306
the first amendment is not about the new york times. %$* 305
the first amendment is about drudge. %$* 305
the first amendment is about extremist newspapers and magazines that are very unpopular. %$* 305
the first amendment is about people who could never win a case in front of a jury. %$* 305
that's who the first amendment's about. %$* 305
i don't worry about the new york times. %$* 305
they can defend themselves. %$* 305
they knock down trees by the forest fulls. %$* 305
governments don't go after-- %$* 305
all right. %$* 13
a couple more questions. %$* 13
newspapers like the new york times. %$* 305
sir, if you can come-- %$* 13
you're in the first row without light. %$* 13
if you could come down to the steps, i'll take you second. %$* 13
you're wearing a white shirt, just so that you could come into where the tv lights can see you. %$* 13
anybody on this side in the meantime? %$* 13
yeah? %$* 13
you were half-hearted. %$* 13
i want somebody full-hearted. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
why don't you just-- %$* 13
can they-- %$* 13
can the camera catch that? %$* 13
you're good? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
okay, go ahead, sir. %$* 13
since we all have to vote at the end of this, i really want to come back to the specific language in the motion and how i should be interpreting this because i want both sides to really argue for the votes of those of us who believe that some states-- %$* 18
the freedom of the press does not extend to some state secrets. %$* 18
so it seems to me that the side for is interpreting this to mean freedom of the press does not extend to some state secrets, and the other side is interpreting it to mean that all state secrets and is disagreeing with it. %$* 18
so which way is it? %$* 18
well, i-- %$* 306
as the proponents-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
i think we say-- %$* 306
it does not say all state secrets. %$* 306
it says some state secrets. %$* 306
or state secrets. %$* 306
you're right. %$* 306
i'm looking for the word "some" there. %$* 18
i'm sorry. %$* 306
i misspoke. %$* 306
but let me explain what i mean. %$* 306
we don't, as i said up front, we don't argue that everything that the government does is a state secret. %$* 306
we argue that some things are state secrets and that the reason the freedom of press has to give way is because there is a process for adjudicating what is state secrets that works, a process that requires, before there is punishment, that you go through a decision to prosecute, a judge winds up weighing in on it, and a jury winds up resolving it. %$* 306
and that under that circumstance, existing set of laws that do inhibit freedom of the press for state secrets work and ought to be kept. %$* 306
i believe my adversaries are arguing the existing set of laws are too discretionary, and we ought to have a recipe list, and only things in the recipe list ought to be prosecuted. %$* 306
so did that help you with your vote? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
but they were agreeing with michael. %$* 13
well-- %$* 305
okay. %$* 13
go ahead, alan. %$* 13
alan, go ahead. %$* 13
well, no, i think-- %$* 305
i think the motion puts the burden on the proponents of the motion to justify the censorship of state secrets based on the term and the criteria "state secrets." we are opposed to that. %$* 305
we concede that there are certain pieces of information that if properly legislated, and if discretion is reduced, and if anybody publishes them, they should be prosecuted. %$* 305
we concede that. %$* 305
but the broad criteria of state secrets, as reflected by the espionage act of 1917, is far too discretionary and far too broad. %$* 305
and the basic issue is, should there be a presumption in favor of publication? %$* 305
that's our position. %$* 305
should there be a presumption against publication, that's their position. %$* 305
david sanger. %$* 13
you know, i think the wikileaks trove goes a long way toward answering your question. %$* 307
everything in the trove that was downloaded and released and would have appeared around the world, even if the new york times and no other american newspaper touched it, because it wasn't being published in the united states initially, every one of those documents was marked "secret," 250,000 documents. %$* 307
and what did the second of defense, robert gates, say about the damage done from their revelation? %$* 307
well, he said, it was a bit overblown. %$* 307
was there damage? %$* 307
sure. %$* 307
there have been several u.s.ambassadors who've had to be recalled. %$* 307
there's been a lot of embarrassment all around. %$* 307
but the state has survived six months later. %$* 307
and we learned a lot about american diplomacy along the way that was pretty important, including some things that julian assange did not want the united states to conclude, including the fact that our diplomats write pretty nicely. %$* 307
that cost was-- %$* 13
but that price was worth paying. %$* 13
yes. %$* 307
i wouldn't have come here to participate in a debate arguing for the proposition-- %$* 304
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
that we should prosecute any, all state secrets. %$* 304
that would be an absurdity. %$* 304
i agree with our opponents here that the government wildly over-classifies and misclassifies, and that's a chronic problem. %$* 304
it's a problem that's not going to be reformed any time soon. %$* 304
but it means that there are categories of genuine secrets. %$* 304
that what we're talking about here. %$* 304
and what's ultimately at stake is that we live in a regime in which, in the final analysis, it's the democratic system, our congress, the executive branch and the courts that get to decide which secrets are protected. %$* 304
one more question. %$* 13
sir, right in the front. %$* 13
as someone who has actually published state secrets and been taken to court for it, i would like to-- %$* 18
and for purely political reasons, i find all of this, four guys dancing around the head of a pin. %$* 18
michael chertoff came closest when he said that some state secrets are worthy of protection, and others are not. %$* 18
and the question is really among you, who should decide that. %$* 18
and i think you actually all agree that this is a debate about who should decide. %$* 13
i think that's right. %$* 18
the question is-- %$* 304
the question has been decided by our congress, which has created a set of statutes, the espionage act and the other statutes i have mentioned, the atomic energy act. %$* 304
and then the executive branch gets to carry out, enforce those statutes. %$* 304
and we live in a very liberal regime. %$* 304
in our whole history we've never had a successful prosecution of a journalist, and only one attempted prosecution. %$* 304
so i don't think there's much of a chilling effect, but the basic principle is in place. %$* 304
freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets because the government has the final word; the jury has the final word. %$* 304
thomas jefferson once said, "the law should be so crystal clear that you should be able to understand it if you read it while running." and there is nothing vaguer than the espionage act of 1917.it gives the government total power to decide who to prosecute. %$* 305
thus far, they have exercised their discretion during peacetime relatively well, during wartime very, very poorly, and the risks of greater prosecution during times of increasing crisis increase. %$* 305
we need to have rules of law, not counting on the discretion of prosecutors, the discretion of juries to protect our first amendment. %$* 305
it's just too valuable. %$* 305
if we want to have a debate about the espionage act, i would think we'd probably be in agreement. %$* 304
it's a very vague act. %$* 304
it's %$* 304
so would you favor its abolition? %$* 305
would you favor its abolition? %$* 305
its reform. %$* 304
but i don't feel-- %$* 304
but i think it's very difficult to reform-- %$* 304
very quickly. %$* 13
but i favor the basic principle. %$* 304
very quickly for michael chertoff. %$* 13
i do think the questioner absolutely put the question that really is dividing us, which is who decides? %$* 306
and i would argue and i think our proposition will be at the end of today that it is the combination of congress having passed the law, the executive branch making its decision to prosecute, and the judge and the jury, you people, deciding whether to convict or not. %$* 306
that's where the ultimate decision has to be made, not in wikileaks or in julian assange's living room. %$* 306
and that concludes round two of this debate. %$* 13
here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted before the debate because we'll be asking you right after these closing statements to vote again, and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements, our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." and here to summarize his position against the motion, david sanger, chief washington correspondent for the new york times. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thanks to all of you. %$* 307
this has been a really interesting discussion that i think has revealed in our discussion of the ambiguity of the current law why a statement as broad as freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets can't stand simply because we cannot really define terribly well what is a true state secret worth protecting. %$* 307
in 29 years as a reporter, i've learned that on two things we almost always get it wrong. %$* 307
whenever something has been leaked to me and i read stories later on about who the leaker was, it's almost invariably wrong, which tells you people get the motivations wrong. %$* 307
but the second thing is my own estimate about what the effects are of publishing a given story is also almost always wrong. %$* 307
it's very difficult as you go in and write something to know whether or not it is actually going to have a very deleterious effect. %$* 307
and that's why we have ended up focusing on the narrowest questions, the obvious, the easy ones, the names of cia agents, operations that are about to be conducted. %$* 307
those are the easy questions. %$* 307
the hard question is what do you do to make sure that the press in the united states can force the government to debate policy on the most important questions, whether or not we invade a country and have the right evidence to go do so, whether or not we use a new weapon, whether it is a nuclear weapon in 1945 or a cyber weapon in 2011, and think out ahead what the effects could be once we legitimize that form of war. %$* 307
you cannot do that unless you have a bias in favor of publication, not just a bias among all of us, but a legal bias in favor of publication, one that will make sure that the republic holds together because we have made ourselves different by pressing for publication whenever there is doubt. %$* 307
thank you, david sanger. %$* 13
our motion is "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." and, gabriel, i just want to ask you a very brief question. %$* 13
did i mispronounce your name at the very beginning of the debate because i thought i saw-- %$* 13
i got a look from you as i said it. %$* 13
okay, i just-- %$* 13
i was going to correct it for the record at this point. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
let me introduce you on this one now. %$* 13
laughter dies down. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position for the motion, gabriel schoenfeld, author of "necessary secrets: national security, the media, and the rule of law.” %$* 13
i agree with david sanger on this last point, that we should have a system that has a bias in favor of publication-- %$* 304
including a legal bias-- %$* 304
and i think that's the system we have and the very vagueness of the espionage act actually has helped the press and created-- %$* 304
helped us create a free press, the freest press in the world. %$* 304
and i think there's room for reform, but our government leaks like a sieve, and the press publishes secrets all the time. %$* 304
but i'm just reminded of an episode that occurred in late 2009, when a new york times reporter-- %$* 304
one of your colleagues, david rohde, was kidnapped by the taliban. %$* 304
and bill keller, the executive editor of the paper, made the executive decision to withhold that information from the public. %$* 304
and not only did the times not cover it, but he got all of his industry competitors and all of the internet to agree not to reveal that david rohde had been kidnapped. %$* 304
and the idea was he didn't want to do anything that would endanger rohde's life. %$* 304
and of course, that was a speculative decision, because really, publishing information about rohde-- %$* 304
the fact that he had been captured-- %$* 304
the taliban knew he'd been captured. %$* 304
but they withheld the story. %$* 304
and i say to bill keller, “all honor to bill keller for that! %$* 304
” they protected the life of their guy. %$* 304
but when the decision involves non-journalists, it can't be. %$* 304
when it involves us. %$* 304
the people who ride the subway in new york. %$* 304
it can't be a voluntary decision up to bill keller. %$* 304
we-- %$* 304
and that's why we have laws on the books that in the final analysis, do allow for the prosecution of the journalists when they publish not just the random things that are stamped “secret” for no good reason, but the genuine, really hardcore secrets that place our lives in danger, including some of the things that your newspaper has published-- %$* 304
like the swift story, once again. %$* 304
thank you. %$* 13
gabriel schoenfeld. %$* 13
our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.”and here to summarize his position against the motion, alan dershowitz, the felix frankfurter professor of law at harvard. %$* 13
the proposition “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets” is far more dangerous than any of the state secrets that have allegedly been leaked during the 200 and some years of our republic. %$* 305
this is an extraordinarily dangerous proposition, saying that freedom of press doesn't extend to state secrets. %$* 305
that's where the other side has to add “genuine,” or “real,” or “some.” and i urge you to vote against this proposition, because if this proposition is passed, it sends an extremely dangerous message to the government-- %$* 305
that it continue business as usual. %$* 305
and the current situation is very clear. %$* 305
anything that's published relating to national security today could be subject to prosecution. %$* 305
why aren't they prosecuted? %$* 305
because the government-- %$* 305
the very government whose secrets are leaked-- %$* 305
makes the discretionary decision not to prosecute. %$* 305
that is the wrong body to trust to make the decision, whether to prosecute. %$* 305
what we need is specific, focused, legislatively enacted rules that say that no one-- %$* 305
not a favorable press, not an unfavorable press-- %$* 305
can ever, under any circumstances, reveal fact a, fact b, fact c.that has to be subject to judicial review. %$* 305
that then has to be subject to trial by jury. %$* 305
the point is you don't trust juries and prosecutors with broad, overarching criminal statutes when it comes to the first amendment. %$* 305
you narrow, you limit, and then you give it to the jury. %$* 305
but the last institution that should be making the decision who to prosecute is the very institution that is criticized by these revelations. %$* 305
so i urge you-- %$* 305
i urge you-- %$* 305
do not support this proposition. %$* 305
this proposition is dangerous to your liberty. %$* 305
thank you. %$* 305
thank you, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
and our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets,” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, michael chertoff, former secretary of homeland security and co-founder of the chertoff group. %$* 13
well, we support the proposition because the proof of the pudding is that we've had hundreds of years of american history where these statues have not been, in fact, a tool to oppress or to run rampant through the first amendment. %$* 306
i think that our adversaries have essentially conceded that there are a category of state secrets that ought to be protected. %$* 306
and what they are arguing is the existing structure is somehow not definite enough. %$* 306
but i just want to spend one minute talking about what the existing law is. %$* 306
because in fact, i think it strikes the right balance, which is the context in which we advocate this proposition. %$* 306
we have the communications intelligence act protecting the information about our top secret code breaking and code making communications activity, quite specific, very reasonable and very understandable. %$* 306
that's what keeps us safe. %$* 306
we have the intelligence identities act, keeping the names of intelligence agents safe as david acknowledges is appropriate and again part of the law. %$* 306
even the espionage act, which has gotten the brunt of the fire power here, requires a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent to damage the national security of the united states, not good intentions, not accident, not negligence, but bad intent to injure the security of the united states. %$* 306
i would argue that's exactly the kind of specificity that is appropriate in defining the category of state secrets that we are arguing ought to be protected under this proposition. %$* 306
and in fact the message that will be sent will not be one that will chill responsible reporters. %$* 306
it will be one that will chill the julian assanges who want to publish things because they want to hurt the united states and then want to claim the first amendment to protect them against the consequences of that kind of decision. %$* 306
thank you very much. %$* 306
thank you, michael chertoff. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to find out which time has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you once again to go to the key pads at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
and we'll get the readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
remember, our motion is “freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” if you agree with this motion, if you are in favor of greater restriction on the press where publishing secrets is concerned, you vote number one. %$* 13
if you are against the motion, that is, you support great lenient license for the press, number two. %$* 13
and if you are or became undecided, press number three. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in about 96 seconds from now. %$* 13
so before i announce the results of the vote, first of all, i want to-- %$* 13
i really want to express my appreciation for this team of debaters and the level of debate and seriousness that they brought to this evening. %$* 13
and i also want to thank all of you in the audience who took part in asking questions. %$* 13
they were all good questions tonight, and we really appreciate that. %$* 13
so a few things that i also want to talk about. %$* 13
this has been our 50th debate, and the conclusion of our fifth series. %$* 13
and this season was sponsored and underwritten significantly for us by the american clean skies foundation. %$* 13
and we really want to give our appreciation to them. %$* 13
and i'd like to do that with a round of applause. %$* 13
but this debate in particular was brought to you in partnership with the film society of lincoln center which is opening with the documentary “page one: inside the new york times.” that's the inaugural presentation at lincoln center's new eleanor hunan monroe film center. %$* 13
and the film actually is-- %$* 13
i've seen it. %$* 13
it's a documentary. %$* 13
it gives very, very excellent and intimate, behind-the-scenes footage of life in the new york times during a year that-- %$* 13
which the industry as a whole was trying to figure out what the industry as a whole was going to do. %$* 13
it also includes a feature-- %$* 13
it features a clip from one of our own debates and a particularly excellent moment with the new york times media writer david carr who sat right at that table. %$* 13
and i won't give it away. %$* 13
you'll have to go see the documentary to see what he did. %$* 13
but it was excellent. %$* 13
and you can go in fact, if you take your ticket stub tonight to the film center's box office, you can see this documentary for free starting on june 17th. %$* 13
dates for our fall season are posted on the web site, and you can take a look at our home page. %$* 13
make sure to have those dates saved to your calendar. %$* 13
we're looking at various topics, but they may include america post-9/11, the decline of men, entitlements, the arab spring and the question of whether the world is better off without religion. %$* 13
tickets will go on sale this summer. %$* 13
all of our debates can be heard on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
and this debate in particular has been recorded for television broadcast on wnet's channel 13 and wliw.also, don't forget you can follow us on twitter and become a fan on facebook. %$* 13
and if you do so, you will get a discount on future tickets. %$* 13
again, this being our 50th debate, i want to put out a special thanks to robert rosenkranz for kicking this whole thing off back in 2006.and getting to 50 is amazing, and all the credit goes to him. %$* 13
well, actually, there's credit to be shared. %$* 13
i'd like to-- %$* 13
dana wolfe, our executive producer who stands up and tells me what to say at every instance, every word that comes out of my mouth was actually processed by her and fed into my ear. %$* 13
and all-- %$* 13
stand up, dana. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
and all of the crew who has made this season possible. %$* 13
so the results are in. %$* 13
remember, our motion is, "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets." before the debate, 39 percent were for the motion, 31 percent against and 30 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 46 percent were for the motion. %$* 13
that was up seven percent. %$* 13
47 percent were against. %$* 13
that's up 16 percent. %$* 13
and seven percent remained undecided. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, "freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets," has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

and i'd like to begin the evening by introducing the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you very much, and it's my pleasure to welcome all of you. %$* 1
my role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. %$* 1
so it's time to clip america's global wings. %$* 1
the u.s.government is in the worst financial shape it has ever been during our lifetimes. %$* 1
china is now the world's second largest economy, and america's largest creditor. %$* 1
with minimal u.s.involvement, popular movements in egypt and tunisia have succeeded in toppling autocratic regimes, largely through peaceful means. %$* 1
and where the u.s. has been involved, as in iraq and afghanistan, it has sometimes compromised its moral authority-- %$* 1
i'm thinking of abu ghraib and guantanamo, abusive interrogations and civilian casualties-- %$* 1
and has often made us more enemies than friends. %$* 1
all these developments suggest that america's hyperactive engagements around the world are financially unsustainable, morally questionable and of dubious value in the hard currency of national self-interest. %$* 1
on the other hand, perhaps developments in the middle east do reflect well on america's long-standing support for liberty and freedom. %$* 1
they certainly reflect well on such american innovations as twitter and facebook. %$* 1
when a tyrant like gaddafi threatens mayhem, and the u.n. security council and the arab league agree that military action is required, a miracle, by the way, their views are meaningless without u.s. power to back it up. %$* 1
when iran is trying its best to achieve a nuclear weapons capability, the u.n.can fret. %$* 1
but only the u.s.can lead a serious effort to prevent them from succeeding. %$* 1
perhaps we're not loved. %$* 1
the rich and the powerful rarely are. %$* 1
but our unflagging efforts are vital to keep the world moving toward greater freedom and greater stability. %$* 1
well, these differing views about america's role in the world are among the most profound political fault lines that we face. %$* 1
the outstanding panelists we've brought together this evening will help you decide which is the better view. %$* 1
and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to our moderator john donvan. %$* 1
john, thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i would really like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz because he's the one who makes these debates possible. %$* 13
true or false, it's time to clip america's wings, its global super power wings. %$* 13
let's have it out. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.we're at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news, and this is another debate from intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
joining me on the stage, two teams of two members each who will be arguing out this motion. %$* 13
we have, arguing for the motion, peter galbraith and lawrence korb; against the motion, eliot cohen and elliott abrams. %$* 13
and i'll point out that throughout the week, the producer of our debate, dana who has enjoyed describing this intelligence squared u.s. debate as having one team that we should call “elliot squared.” but-- %$* 13
but we won't. %$* 13
i want to remind you, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
it's a contest of ideas and logic and argumentation. %$* 13
and you, our audience, will be the judges of this contest. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards on our motion, “it's time to clip america's global wings.” and the team that has changed the most minds by the end of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's register your first position, you and members of our audience on this debate. %$* 13
if you go to the keypad to the right of your seat, our motion is, “it's time to clip america's global wings.” if you agree with the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you are undecided at this point, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you feel that you entered a key in error, just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it looks like everybody got it. %$* 13
our motion, “it's time to clip america's global wings.” and on to round one. %$* 13
round one, we have opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each. %$* 13
and our first debater up to speak for this motion, peter galbraith. %$* 13
he's a former u.s.diplomat. %$* 13
he served as a special deputy representative of the u.n.in afghanistan. %$* 13
he was the first u.s.ambassador to croatia. %$* 13
he is currently a vermont state senator. %$* 13
his entire life has been involved in diplomacy, including a stint as a cabinet member of the transitional government of east timor, which comes, peter, with what sorts of perks, passport, what? %$* 13
use of the vip lounge in dili international airport. %$* 541
but i will say it is a culmination of a career that began with a foreign relations committee ambassador to croatia, of ever more important jobs in ever smaller places. %$* 541
ladies and gentlemen, peter galbraith. %$* 13
it is time to clip america's global wings. %$* 541
america's global ambitions, particularly in the last decade, have far exceeded our capabilities. %$* 541
it is more than we can afford, more than a trillion dollars on two wars in afghanistan and in iraq. %$* 541
but beyond the fact that we can't afford it-- %$* 541
and my colleague, larry korb, will make that case, it is that we are not capable of doing it. %$* 541
we do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs, the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the iraq war or the afghanistan war. %$* 541
the fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises, and we did not succeed. %$* 541
in fact, i will argue to you that we have not only not helped the united states, we have undermined america’s national security. %$* 541
now i want to be clear. %$* 541
larry korb and i are not isolationists, we are not against u.s.-- %$* 541
use of u.s.power in the world. %$* 541
when i served as the first u.s.ambassador to croatia, i argued strongly for u.s.airstrikes against the serbs who were attacking sarajevo and civilians in bosnia and herzegovina, and when those airstrikes took place, they combined with intense diplomacy, they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end. %$* 541
it was effective. %$* 541
larry korb and i support the intervention in libya, and it is-- %$* 541
for the same reason that it is working in bosnia-- %$* 541
it was in bosnia and in libya we had limited ambitions. %$* 541
in bosnia it was to end the war, in libya to protect civilians. %$* 541
we had allies in bosnia, the europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction. %$* 541
they’re doing much of the heavy lifting in libya, and we had partners on the ground. %$* 541
that is not the case in iraq or in afghanistan. %$* 541
in the case of iraq, we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government, and in the end, who ended up as the victor? %$* 541
iran. %$* 541
for eight years, the ayatollah khomeini and the clerical government in iran fought the iran-iraq war, at a cost of a half a million iranian soldiers for the goal of installing, of getting rid of saddam hussein, and of installing in power dawa and sciri, two iranian-supported shiite parties. %$* 541
they failed. %$* 541
in 2003, the u.s.went in, and who is it that is in power in iraq but the dawa has the prime ministership, sciri plays a major role. %$* 541
talk about unintended consequences. %$* 541
in afghanistan, the united states is embarked on a counterinsurgency, i want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the taliban, to drive out-- %$* 541
to try to kill and capture al-qaeda was correct, morally justified, endorsed by the u.n. security council, but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires-- %$* 541
if general petraeus were here, its architect, he would say just what i’m going to say-- %$* 541
it requires a local partner for it to work. %$* 541
our partner in afghanistan is hamid karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world-- %$* 541
number one is somalia which doesn’t have a government at all-- %$* 541
is ineffective, illegitimate, having stolen his last election through massive fraud, and as a result, the strategy doesn’t work. %$* 541
we have invested billions in training an afghan police force. %$* 541
our idea is that by training an afghan police force, they'll be partners who can provide security, and why do we train the police? %$* 541
because that’s what we know how to do, but the problem in afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt afghan regime. %$* 541
the money that we’ve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in afghanistan isn’t working because, yes, the roads are there, farmers don’t bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market. %$* 541
we can train the police to be policemen, but we cannot make them honest. %$* 541
afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions. %$* 541
we are spending this year $117 billion on the afghanistan war. %$* 541
to fight an enemy, the taliban, whose budget is estimated between $70 million and $200 million, and how do the taliban fund themselves? %$* 541
from the united states. %$* 541
why? %$* 541
because to supply our military in afghanistan, we bring in supplies to the pakistani port of karachi, they go through taliban-controlled territory. %$* 541
the contractors pay off the taliban. %$* 541
and with the money used to pay for u.s. troops in afghanistan, we ourselves are financing the taliban. %$* 541
now look at this from the point of view from the extremists. %$* 541
we can spend $70 million and get the u.s.to spend $117 billion. %$* 541
that is a pretty good investment. %$* 541
so, our position is simple. %$* 541
we need to scale back what the united states is doing in the world. %$* 541
yes, to continue global engagements. %$* 541
yes, to working with allies. %$* 541
but no to this ambitious overreaching. %$* 541
yes to being smart. %$* 541
so, please join me in supporting the proposition that it is time to clip america’s global wings. %$* 541
thank you, peter galbraith. %$* 13
and that’s our motion: "it's time to clip america's global wings." and here to speak first against the motion, i’d like to introduce eliot cohen. %$* 13
he’s a professor of strategic studies at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university. %$* 13
he’s a former counselor at the department of state, former army reserve officer, so he’s worked with an elite force, former faculty member at harvard, so he’s worked with a force of elitists, and-- %$* 13
and, given the fact that you have a son who has done two tours in iraq, none of this is theoretical for you, is it? %$* 13
no, it’s not theoretical for a lot of people both here and abroad. %$* 542
ladies and gentlemen, eliot cohen. %$* 13
well, i can see one of our challenges tonight on the con team is to make it very clear that our opponents stick to what the debate’s about. %$* 542
the topic of the debate was not, “the iraq war: good idea, bad idea? %$* 542
” the topic was not, “afghanistan: well conducted, poorly conducted? %$* 542
” the topic is should we clip america’s global wings? %$* 542
this is not a debate about president bush. %$* 542
it’s not a debate about president obama. %$* 542
it’s not a debate about iraq. %$* 542
it is not a debate about libya. %$* 542
it is not debate about afghanistan. %$* 542
it is most certainly not a debate about whether prudence is better than recklessness. %$* 542
it’s not a debate about military power versus soft power. %$* 542
it is a debate about america’s role in the world. %$* 542
our view-- %$* 542
my view and the view of the elliot who can’t spell his own first name correctly-- %$* 542
is very much that of a statesman who said that the united states is an anchor of global security and an advocate for human freedom. %$* 542
that would be president barack obama. %$* 542
it is the mainstream view. %$* 542
now, our colleagues have chosen or have agreed to a metaphor which is not one that i would have signed up to. %$* 542
when you clip a bird’s wings, it can only fly so high or so far. %$* 542
it’s not a question of where you try to get the bird to fly; it’s what the bird can do. %$* 542
so the question that they will have to address is what capabilities should we give up, not what waste should we curtail? %$* 542
we’re all against waste. %$* 542
what regions of the world no longer matter to us? %$* 542
what issues will we ignore? %$* 542
and what will be the consequences when we do so? %$* 542
they’ve already begun by making a number of distinctions, some of which i have to say i find difficult to understand. %$* 542
we have limited objectives in libya when president obama has said that gaddafi has got to go. %$* 542
we have local allies. %$* 542
exactly who? %$* 542
i’m not quite sure. %$* 542
our opponents will and have begun making a number of arguments. %$* 542
they will argue-- %$* 542
they have argued that this is way too costly. %$* 542
i would just remind the audience of one statistical fact. %$* 542
the united states today spends something on the order of about five percent of gross domestic product on defense, maybe a little bit more. %$* 542
during the kennedy administration, that figure was over eight percent, during the eisenhower administration, over 10 percent. %$* 542
even with the vast expenses of the wars in iraq and afghanistan, it is not the defense budget that is the cause of our current economic difficulties. %$* 542
our record is tarnished. %$* 542
well, the price of action is frequently exposing yourself in that way. %$* 542
there were plenty of air strikes in bosnia, the war that ambassador galbraith favored, that killed civilians. %$* 542
that’s the price of going to war. %$* 542
i want to make a larger point about the world view that elliot and i share and that, really, i think, informs our position in this. %$* 542
the first is a set of propositions about the united states, of which the most important is this: the united states has always been a global nation from the very beginning. %$* 542
we were born as part of an atlantic community. %$* 542
from the outset, our trade stretched across the world, to china and to the middle east. %$* 542
when the united states chose not to act as a global power with global responsibilities, we were not always the ones who paid for that. %$* 542
when we did-- %$* 542
and of course, the time that we all think of is the period after world war ii-- %$* 542
it was not simply that the united states used its force wisely, as i believe it did. %$* 542
it built enduring edifices of alliances, institutions and practices that have served us and have served the world well. %$* 542
fundamentally, i think the difference comes down to this: elliott and i believe that the united states is a force for good in the world. %$* 542
that doesn't mean that we don't make mistakes. %$* 542
of course, we will. %$* 542
that is, in many ways, the price of action. %$* 542
but we believe that the united states has been a force for good, can be a force for good and should continue to think of itself that way. %$* 542
we share a second fundamental world view, and that is a view about the nature of our environment. %$* 542
in many ways, we've entered a world which is a dangerous and difficult place, not just thinking of issues like nuclear proliferation or global warming. %$* 542
by the way, it's not clear to me that if you clip america's global wings, why doesn't that cover things like the united states taking the lead on global warming? %$* 542
but beyond that, we live at a time of tremendous movements in human history. %$* 542
i'll just mention two. %$* 542
in the last decade, hundreds of millions of chinese have risen out of poverty. %$* 542
that is unambiguously a good thing. %$* 542
it is a good thing that countries like china don't have to worry about famine, that chinese fathers and mothers can have expectations of a better life for their children than they have had. %$* 542
but it is also true that the same economic growth that has pulled hundreds of millions of chinese out of poverty, arms a military establishment which acts in support of a foreign policy that claims, among other things, territorial rights to the south and east china seas, to include the territory of some of our closest allies like japan. %$* 542
well, let's take the dramatic events of recent months, the arab spring. %$* 542
in many ways, this is say good thing. %$* 542
there's no question about that. %$* 542
it is quite an extraordinary thing to watch. %$* 542
by the way, it's very striking, i think, to me and to many others, that there's not very much-- %$* 542
there's no anti-americanism in any of that. %$* 542
but there's clearly potential for this to go in a number of directions. %$* 542
our fundamental position is it's in america's interest to act where we can act, to guide and shape these events and not to be timid and not to be afraid, to exercise leadership that only the united states can lead. %$* 542
thank you, eliot cohen. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
our motion is “it's time to clip america's global wings.” i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over our motion. %$* 13
and you've heard two opening statements, and now we're going to go on to the third. %$* 13
lawrence korb is a senior fellow at the center for american progress who served as assistant secretary of defense under the reagan administration. %$* 13
and lawrence has-- %$* 13
you worked for the reagan administration, but now you are working for a think tank, you know, populated by a lot of clinton guys. %$* 13
is something not adding up in this picture or-- %$* 13
what's not adding up is that the republican party has changed tremendously since the days of reagan. %$* 543
remember when-- %$* 543
in the reagan administration, when we got into lebanon, it didn't work, reagan got out. %$* 543
he raised taxes 11 times when he recognized that supply-side economics was not working. %$* 543
he worked with members of congress to reform the social security system that kept it in balance until this year. %$* 543
i think we might be getting into your set of minutes, so i'm going to-- %$* 13
well, i thought i would take advantage of it. %$* 543
so i'm going to launch you with, ladies and gentlemen, lawrence korb. %$* 13
my point is that even if you think the united states should be more involved in the world, the problem is right now we're broke. %$* 543
we borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends. %$* 543
we borrow-- %$* 543
put it another way-- %$* 543
$4 billion a day. %$* 543
now, if you go back and you take a look-- %$* 543
and i know our opponents don't want to talk about the previous administration. %$* 543
go back to the beginning of this century. %$* 543
the beginning of this century, the united states accounted for one-third of the world's gross domestic product. %$* 543
we spent one- third of what the world spends on military. %$* 543
here we are today, we account for only one quarter of the world's gross domestic product, but yet we account for half of the world's military expenditures. %$* 543
five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense. %$* 543
now, remember at the beginning of this century, we had a budget surplus. %$* 543
you may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000.that surplus was supposed to make sure that social security would not run out of money quicker than it has. %$* 543
where did we end up at the end of this decade? %$* 543
not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion. %$* 543
and then, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit even more. %$* 543
now, the question becomes, how do we get there? %$* 543
defense played a part. %$* 543
the war has played a part. %$* 543
it wasn't the only part, but i think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968, when we had 540,000 people in vietnam, we balanced the budget. %$* 543
how did we do it? %$* 543
we had a surtax, a war surtax. %$* 543
what happened this time? %$* 543
you can be for or against the wars in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 543
but the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn't pay for it. %$* 543
in fact, what we did is we cut taxes. %$* 543
we've never done that in our-- %$* 543
in our history. %$* 543
and what happened? %$* 543
the wars cost-- %$* 543
the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far. %$* 543
but the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a long time. %$* 543
and joe stiglitz up here, a columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5 trillion. %$* 543
we compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call the baseline budget. %$* 543
general mcchrystal, who everybody knows, i had the privilege of working with at the council on foreign relations about 10 years ago. %$* 543
before he went to afghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget. %$* 543
and he told me, when i spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make any choices. %$* 543
we could have everything. %$* 543
the baseline budget also went up during this particular period. %$* 543
again, during vietnam and during korea which had war costs, we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our national security. %$* 543
now, you don't think the deficit's a problem? %$* 543
admiral mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said it's the biggest threat to national security. %$* 543
and he says unless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad. %$* 543
now, the defense and i agree with it. %$* 543
wasn't the only thing. %$* 543
we as individuals live beyond our means. %$* 543
we all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year. %$* 543
and, you know, we made our decisions on that basis. %$* 543
states right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year. %$* 543
well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems. %$* 543
now, the question becomes, okay, now we have these problems. %$* 543
maybe we should still do a lot more in the world. %$* 543
and again, we're not against involvement. %$* 543
but it has to be selective engagement. %$* 543
you can't deal with every situation. %$* 543
but we've got a lot of challenges at home. %$* 543
you probably have seen all of the statistics. %$* 543
we're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math. %$* 543
these are our children. %$* 543
our infrastructure is falling apart. %$* 543
we're 27th in life expectancy. %$* 543
you know, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things. %$* 543
obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty-- %$* 543
poverty line. %$* 543
and what we're doing, as a country, we're living off our past investments. %$* 543
if you go back and look where we are today, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s. %$* 543
now, can you cut defense? %$* 543
yeah, you sure can. %$* 543
if you take a look at what we're spending on defense, and you put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the cold war average, it was 450 billion. %$* 543
right now it's 550 billion. %$* 543
how do i know it's too much? %$* 543
secretary of defense says $150 billion in inefficiencies. %$* 543
well, we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home. %$* 543
and a couple of things, you know, that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are-- %$* 543
secretary gates, secretary of defense goes to west point. %$* 543
we’re not going to send large land armies into muslim countries again, okay? %$* 543
this is a man who worked for president reagan, worked for president bush, is now working for president obama. %$* 543
well, if you’re not going to do that, let’s take a look at the size of the army and the marine corps. %$* 543
this is something that you can do. %$* 543
we also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve them all. %$* 543
and i think, as peter pointed out, i think libya’s the perfect example of the way to do that. %$* 543
we used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you know who’s a great example for this, the first president bush. %$* 543
you may remember in the campaign, president obama said, “i like president bush,” and everybody said, “you do? %$* 543
” and he said, “well, the first president bush.” the first persian gulf war we got over 200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldn’t send troops, we collected money. %$* 543
we collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war. %$* 543
so it didn’t cost us anything and, in conclusion, we’ve done it before. %$* 543
eisenhower got us out of korea, wouldn’t go into hungary and poland, or into vietnam. %$* 543
nixon got us out of vietnam, started arms control with the soviet union, recognized china, and even reagan, when he started negotiating with the russians, you know what newt gingrich called him? %$* 543
neville chamberlain. %$* 543
thank you very much. %$* 543
thank you, lawrence korb. %$* 13
our motion is "it’s time to clip america’s global wings," and now to speak against the motion, elliott abrams, he’s a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations. %$* 13
he served as a deputy national security adviser in charge of middle eastern affairs in the george w.bush administration. %$* 13
he recently commented himself on the libya situation by saying the great mistake that the obama white house had made in its foreign policy-- %$* 13
in its policy towards gaddafi was believing that gaddafi was a normal human being. %$* 13
so personality counts in the big picture? %$* 13
personality counts because in any given time there are three or four or 10 heads of government around the world who are certifiably insane. %$* 544
ladies and gentlemen, elliott abrams. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 544
thank you. %$* 544
thank you all for being here. %$* 544
listening to these presentations, here i am, batting cleanup here, and i’ve only got seven minutes to correct so many mistakes. %$* 544
you know the joke, the old, old, old joke about the guy who is looking for his keys under the lamppost and the man says to him, “did you drop your keys here? %$* 544
” and the guy says, “no, but the light’s better here.” why are we cutting the military budget? %$* 544
we’re cutting the military budget apparently because the military budget got us into the fiscal mess we’re in? %$* 544
wrong, it didn’t. %$* 544
let’s start with the fact that we are cutting the military budget already. %$* 544
it isn’t as if we’re in a situation where these global wings are spreading, and the military budget is becoming a gigantic-- %$* 544
i mean, defense news, february, "u.s.air force budget shrinks." the air force, since we’re talking about wings, has been shrinking decade after decade. %$* 544
armed forces journal, "tactical inventory of the air force is as small today as at any point since world war ii." many of you no doubt read every morning the website entitled, “war is boring.” it exists. %$* 544
and it's said of the 2010 budget, the new budget includes cuts and additions. %$* 544
the air force took the biggest hits. %$* 544
now, if you’re going to clip our wings, and in fact many of those wings are being clipped, you have to make some assumptions about the world. %$* 544
you have to assume that there will be no war on the korean peninsula. %$* 544
you have to assume there'll be no war between israel and iran. %$* 544
you have to assume absolute stability in asia despite the rise of china. %$* 544
you have to assume no 9/11 attack on the united states again, that we wish to respond to. %$* 544
are you absolutely confident about all of that, confident enough to reduce american power, that in one, or two, or five, or 10 years we may need? %$* 544
you know, the person who summed this up best was actually president obama in his nobel speech. %$* 544
“the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions, not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post- world war ii world. %$* 544
whatever mistakes we’ve made, the plain fact is this: the united states of america has under-- %$* 544
has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens, and the strength of our arms. %$* 544
the position the other side is taking is a very radical position, i mean, well to the left of president obama. %$* 544
now, we have been spreading our wings for some decades as eliot mentioned. %$* 544
the world is a better place for it. %$* 544
peter mentioned some of the places where it is a better place. %$* 544
bosnia was, i think, the example he used. %$* 544
take a look at asia today. %$* 544
it’s an interesting thing. %$* 544
you don’t hear the south koreans, the taiwanese, the vietnamese, the singaporeans, the indians saying, “hey, it’s time to clip your global wings,” because they’re afraid of china. %$* 544
and they want our help in balancing a rising china. %$* 544
look at vietnam. %$* 544
some of you will remember the cam ranh bay naval base that we had during the vietnam war. %$* 544
now-- %$* 544
now, the government of vietnam has asked us to come back. %$* 544
their defense minister was quoted as saying, “this port should be a fuel stop for aircraft carriers.” well, they don’t have any aircraft carriers. %$* 544
he means our aircraft carriers, that they weren’t stopping there to counterbalance china. %$* 544
the idea that we need to diminish the size of our military-- %$* 544
let me quote from a famous american. %$* 544
getting the democratic nomination in 2004, john kerry said, “i will never give any nation or institution a veto over our national security, and i will build a stronger military. %$* 544
we will add 40,000 active duty troops.” that’s john kerry. %$* 544
these guys are taking a position well to the extreme on these questions. %$* 544
now the finances. %$* 544
“we have to cut the military budget because we’re broke.” bill clinton’s budget director, alice rivlin, wrote last week-- %$* 544
last month, excuse me-- %$* 544
quote, “defense spending is not a cause of the growing projected deficits. %$* 544
it’s the entitlement programs that drive future spending up faster than gdp can grow.” clinton budget director. %$* 544
the deputy secretary of the treasury for bill clinton, roger altman, “imperial overstretch is not the real issue here. %$* 544
it is fiscal, economic, and political failures at home that are threatening the ability of the united states to exert global influence.” the defense budget has been falling as a percentage of gdp for decades. %$* 544
it’s falling under four percent now. %$* 544
it is scheduled in the next five years to go under three percent of gdp. so what’s the argument they’re making? %$* 544
really, it’s ideological. %$* 544
american power is bad. %$* 544
well, that’s not exactly the argument. %$* 544
peter tells us american power in bosnia was good. %$* 544
so i guess what it comes down to is this: when is american power bad and when is american power good? %$* 544
just ask them. %$* 544
and they’ll tell you where we need to intervene and where we don’t. %$* 544
doesn’t work. %$* 544
if the united states is going to reduce our global wings, if we’re going to reduce our power, we’re going to put ourselves in a situation where we cannot do what we need to do around the globe. %$* 544
now, who benefits from this? %$* 544
who benefits? %$* 544
who benefits if there are more srebrenicas and darfurs and rwandas? %$* 544
the answer is people like gaddafi and milosevic and bashar al-assad and saddam hussein. %$* 544
they benefit. %$* 544
we do not and the people who depend on us and our power for their safety in a very dangerous world, 300 million americans and hundreds of millions more around the globe. %$* 544
we’ll lose. %$* 544
do not buy this picture of america that doesn’t exist, with a people and a military and a president just lusting for intervention everywhere, and a military budget that must be decimated if we are to be safe. %$* 544
on the contrary, if we are to be safe, and if the world is to be safe, those global wings need to be strong. %$* 544
thank you. %$* 544
thank you, elliott abrams. %$* 13
that concludes round one of this intelligence squared debate where our motion is "it's time to clip america's global wings." now we want to have you keep in mind how you voted again at the beginning of the evening because at the end of the arguments, we’re going to have you vote again. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly and they also answer questions from the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two here at new york university’s skirball center for the performing arts. %$* 13
we have peter galbraith and lawrence korb who are arguing for the motion, "it's time to clip america's global wings." they’ve been making the argument that america is drastically overreaching. %$* 13
it’s essentially a pragmatic argument, that we cannot afford to overreach much longer. %$* 13
their opponents, eliot cohen and elliot abrams, are making somewhat more of a moral argument. %$* 13
they're saying that the u.s. has always been a global power. %$* 13
and when it has chosen not to be so, somebody usually ends up paying in the end. %$* 13
i want to put to the team that's arguing for the motion. %$* 13
now, your opponents are essentially saying, if we can be involved globally, if we can, we should. %$* 13
your argument is more, we can't, so we shouldn't. %$* 13
it's about-- %$* 13
it's about, you're putting it in terms of a price tag, or that's certainly how it's sounding to me. %$* 13
and if i'm wrong, i'd like you to correct it. %$* 13
but your opponents are also saying that you just basically find beyond that the use of u.s.power somehow distasteful. %$* 13
peter galbraith. %$* 13
well, i'm looking for the elephant here, the elephant in the room, because we just had a discussion from the opponents of this motion that didn't discuss iraq and afghanistan which are the two major projections of american power, the two major expenditures in this millennium. %$* 541
okay, this century, if you don't want to be too ambitious. %$* 541
the problem with them is that they have ended up weakening the united states. %$* 541
certainly the iraq war caused america's prestige, which was sky high after bosnia and kosovo to collapse. %$* 541
turkey, we went from an 80 percent approval rating to a six percent approval rating in the second largest country in nato.we have ended up empowering iran. %$* 541
you will recall president bush describing an axis of evil, of tehran and baghdad. %$* 541
they were bitter enemies-- %$* 541
but, peter, are you arguing the principle is the issue or the execution is the issue? %$* 13
it is the execution. %$* 541
it is that we try to do things that we can't do. %$* 541
we tried to-- %$* 541
but your opponents are making an argument about principle. %$* 13
well-- %$* 541
look, they are the george bush administration, what they represent is probably the most ambitious idealistic american administration. %$* 541
but they didn't succeed. %$* 541
okay. %$* 13
let me have-- %$* 13
it can't work. %$* 541
one of the elliotts come in. %$* 13
eliot cohen. %$* 13
i think if you-- %$* 542
by the way, if you notice, the only president we were quoting was barack obama. %$* 542
well, i understand why you wouldn't want to quote bush. %$* 541
well, right. %$* 542
that's understandable. %$* 541
with whom we agree on basic principles. %$* 542
and the fact is we didn't talk about iraq. %$* 542
that was not the topic that was given. %$* 542
and in fact, i think you can think that the iraq war was a stupid idea, as barack obama does, and still think that this is a bad idea. %$* 542
yeah, but how bad an idea could it have been? %$* 543
eliot cohen. %$* 13
you supported it, sir, in 2003. so you don't-- %$* 542
you're pointing to lawrence korb. %$* 13
no. %$* 542
i'm pointing at peter galbraith. %$* 542
peter galbraith. %$* 13
but let me say something here. %$* 543
let me say something here. %$* 543
what's the argument? %$* 542
what we're talking about here is-- %$* 543
and you mention my republican thing-- %$* 543
the way the republicans always look at cost benefits. %$* 543
you want to quote someone? %$* 543
let me quote one of your colleagues, fukiyama, who wrote the book, “the end of history” and talked about-- %$* 543
he's not a republican, by the way. %$* 542
he was one of the-- %$* 543
and neither am i, actually, for the record. %$* 542
supporters of the war. %$* 543
but you know, frank said-- %$* 543
and he supported the war, he said, if you had told the american people in 2003, we're going to go to war in iraq, and we're going to have almost 5,000 americans die, 30 to 40,000 wounded, hundreds of thousands of iraqis die, spend over a trillion dollars so iraq could have an election, you would have been laughed out of the ballpark. %$* 543
you've got to have select-- %$* 543
i remember growing up in new york city at the time of the polish and hungarian revolutions. %$* 543
and you had a lot of people from eastern europe here. %$* 543
and basically, they wanted the united states to do something. %$* 543
how can you stand by? %$* 543
i remember pictures of cardinal mindszenty on the head of the daily news, "we've got to do-- %$* 543
" no. %$* 543
eisenhower made a calculation. %$* 543
when they wanted them to bail out the french at dien bien phu. %$* 543
general ridgway came to them and said, “hey, here's the cost.” he said, “forget it. %$* 543
bedell smith, go to”-- %$* 543
all right. %$* 13
let me go to the other side. %$* 13
what you're hearing is an argument that lots of time the u.s. has chosen not to get involved because-- %$* 13
oh, sure. %$* 543
of the cost. %$* 13
eliot cohen-- %$* 13
elliott abrams. %$* 13
one of the causes in the world that i do care about a lot is tibet. %$* 544
i'm not urging us to go to war with china over tibet. %$* 544
we can’t do it. %$* 544
it would be foolish. %$* 544
but peter, in 2003, supported the war for the right reasons, i mean morally, the right reasons. %$* 544
what he said was he thought there would be just massacres in kurdistan, and there would be massacres of the shia, and indeed, there had already been. %$* 544
those are, i think, morally compelling arguments for why we did what we did. %$* 544
and we avoided those massacres. %$* 544
and in fact, the kurds are doing very well now, and there is a shia majority government, democratic government in iraq. %$* 544
i also don't accept the view that the iraq war has been lost. %$* 544
it wasn't lost in 2007, wasn't when you said it was. %$* 544
wasn't lost in 2008 or '9.it isn't lost now. %$* 544
it may be too soon to say what the final outcome in iraq is going to be, but it certainly isn't lost. %$* 544
but i just don't understand how you can say, no, it was-- %$* 544
it would have been right to just let the kurds and the shia be slaughtered by saddam hussein. %$* 544
and, by the way-- %$* 544
well, let me let peter galbraith reply directly to that because you worked with the kurds quite a bit. %$* 13
what about that? %$* 13
well, there's no doubt that the people-- %$* 541
the peoples of iraq-- %$* 541
because there isn't such a thing as an iraqi nation. %$* 541
but that the peoples of iraq, 80 percent of whom are either kurds or shiites have emerged much better off. %$* 541
and possibly, if we had gone in, gotten rid of saddam hussein and gotten out, if we hadn't undertaken the bremer multibillion dollar occupation where we had people-- %$* 541
sent young people in there with no experience to run the iraqi budget, to draw up the traffic plans for baghdad, that's how ambitious we were. %$* 541
we were doing american traffic plans for baghdad. %$* 541
you know, but we'd gotten rid of saddam, gotten out, it might have been a rather different history. %$* 541
but you cannot say that this was worth nearly a trillion dollars, especially when it meant that iran, which had been intimidated in 2003-- %$* 541
its nuclear program was on hold-- %$* 541
had become emboldened in part because its best friends were now running iraq. %$* 541
and north korea took advantage of this to get a free pass. %$* 541
i think all of us would agree that proliferation-- %$* 541

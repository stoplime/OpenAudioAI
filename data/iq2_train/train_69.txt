yeah. %$* 13
because what i heard as an argument against the citizen funding is essentially that it's unpopular and that it's hard. %$* 268
and i think both of those things are true, but i don't think this is a debate about what's politically popular or not. %$* 268
it's a debate about what's the right answer. %$* 268
so you can design a system that actually drives politicians towards their constituents. %$* 268
i described it in my opening remarks. %$* 268
so the system we have in new york city where you only get the funding from the city when you raise money from your constituents in small dollars. %$* 268
that transforms the way that people-- %$* 268
people raise money in this city. %$* 268
and you have to make it big enough to-- %$* 268
it's true, we still have, on the books, a presidential public financing system. %$* 268
i don't know what it is this year, but in 2008, it was worth about $110 million. %$* 268
so that's just not a relevant number any more. %$* 268
it has to be robust enough that a candidate opting into the system believes that they can really run a credible campaign. %$* 268
how many of you checked off the little box on your tax return that said you were willing to give money to that fund? %$* 266
jacob sullum. %$* 13
david keating. %$* 13
well, i find-- %$* 265
did you want an audience response from this? %$* 13
i think it's a fair question. %$* 13
you're asking how many people have actually checked off-- %$* 13
it looked like most people did not. %$* 266
is that accurate? %$* 266
who-- %$* 266
who checked off the box for that fund? %$* 266
so right here in this audience, which i suspect is disproportionately in favor of this sort of thing-- %$* 266
you can't even get a majority here. %$* 266
just for our radio audience, let's mention that all the hands went up. %$* 13
nearly all the hands went up. %$* 13
anyway, i actually-- %$* 265
david keating. %$* 13
found it kind of amusing that we're pointing to new york city's council as a model of clean government. %$* 265
i mean, jonathan-- %$* 265
jonathan just described a system of tax funded elections that's the model they want to take to the rest of the country. %$* 265
and we're looking at new york city's council as the model of great representation produced by this. %$* 265
i, for one, don't agree with that. %$* 265
you look at the quality of the law making coming out of there, and, you know, it doesn't seem to work. %$* 265
so i don't think we want to copy that model. %$* 265
sir in the neck tie. %$* 13
gil hyde hi. %$* 13
my name is gil hyde, i do high school debate here in the city. %$* 13
and i have a question that's more theoretical than anything else. %$* 13
you talk about the appearance of corruption, both teams have. %$* 13
and my question is the appearance of corruption versus actual corruption, whether it would make a difference if we didn't see the corruption towards the debate. %$* 13
that's a great point because the response to the appearance of corruption is you just hide it, and then people don't worry about it. %$* 266
it's not a problem. %$* 266
jacob sullum. %$* 13
but yes, i think that is a problem because it hinges on something that may not be real. %$* 266
and this whole notion that underlies this, that you want people to have faith in your government ought to be controversial. %$* 266
there's such a thing as having too much faith in your government. %$* 266
some people look at these declining ratings for congress and the federal government, and they say this is terrible. %$* 266
people are losing faith in the government. %$* 266
other people look at that, and they say, thank god voters are finally wising up, right? %$* 266
and so obviously that's going to depend on your own views about how big government should be, what it should be doing and so forth. %$* 266
but it is not an uncontroversial idea that everyone should have faith in the government. %$* 266
jacob-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, trevor potter. %$* 13
so that may mean that we would have been better off if we'd never known that the nixon administration sold milk price supports for $2 million to the-- %$* 267
according to corruption argument, yeah. %$* 266
milk people and sold an antitrust case to itt.what the court said is you have to worry about both. %$* 267
you have to worry about actual corruption because that means that government is not doing its job. %$* 267
it's not impartially deciding in the common good. %$* 267
and you have to worry about the appearance because if citizens think that's what's going on, and they look at all this money and they look at who's getting it and the way these super pacs are working linked closely to candidates, and think, "well, i don't have any role in this, they are all in a league different than mine, and they're getting something for their money," that appearance is a problem for us, too. %$* 267
one more question, sir, right in the-- %$* 13
oh, right down in the front here. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
mic is coming. %$* 13
i guess i get the women vote then, right? %$* 273
i heard you got-- %$* 273
my name's kim barker-- %$* 273
and i've heard you talk a lot about super pacs this evening and some mention of social welfare, nonprofits, and trade associations. %$* 273
i guess i'd like to ask both sides what role you think those anonymous donation groups are going to play this election, and to get a defense of anonymous money in politics, and also why it might not be so good. %$* 273
you're asking for a defense of anonymity in politics? %$* 13
anonymous money, the trade associations and the social welfare, nonprofits-- %$* 273
yeah, such as the national rifle association, sierra club-- %$* 13
yeah, yeah, yeah. %$* 273
organizations like that do not have to disclose who their donors are, okay. %$* 13
and you're asking for somebody-- %$* 13
and you're looking for a defense of that anonymity. %$* 13
a defense and also why that's not so good. %$* 273
and an attack, okay. %$* 13
jacob sullum. %$* 13
well, and i think it's the case, and david can correct me if i'm wrong, because it's actually-- %$* 266
this is a small percentage of the money for super pacs that comes from these nonprofits. %$* 266
i'm asking about the direct spending because a lot of these groups spend directly. %$* 273
oh, okay, i thought you meant donations, super, i'm sorry. %$* 266
no, no, no, i mean, you look for example. %$* 273
right, okay. %$* 266
as i said before, i think there really is a value in not having to disclose the people who are supporting these groups. %$* 266
i mean, imagine somebody who supports, say, norml and doesn't want his employer to know that, or he supports norml, or-- %$* 266
fill in your favorite group, whatever it is, you can imagine reasons why people don't want their support to be widely known. %$* 266
and, in fact, this has been recognized to some extent by the supreme court in a case involving the naacp, where i think it-- %$* 266
was it alabama-- %$* 266
wanted to force them to disclose all of their supporters. %$* 266
and the supreme court said, "no, this is-- %$* 266
we're all going to close our eyes, and the person-- %$* 13
this hinges on freedom-- %$* 266
the phone is interfering. %$* 13
we are-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
resume. %$* 13
the supreme court said basically, "if you have to reveal who all your supporters are for a group that's engaged in advocacy that's controversial, that obviously has a chilling effect. %$* 266
it chills freedom of association and freedom of speech, too." so i think there is an argument-- %$* 266
a strong argument you've made against forcing those groups to disclose who their supporters are. %$* 266
jonathan soros. %$* 13
so the naacp case is a popular argument and response, and there are a lot of reasons why it doesn't quite fit. %$* 268
but one of-- %$* 268
first of all, it stands also for the proposition that there is an exemption for disclosure if there's a real threat to the members from disclosure-- %$* 268
a clear-- %$* 268
and alabama at that time, there were clearly threats to members. %$* 268
there was also no state interest at all in getting that membership list in naacp. so a couple of things on the information first of all, elections are different, right? %$* 268
there's lots of anonymous political speech in our society, and we don't go around looking for the sources of those speech. %$* 268
but when you're talking about advocating for the election of someone who's going to represent their population, and you want to have that clear connection between the electorate and the elected official to know that they're actually representing their constituency, elections are different. %$* 268
there's an informational component, right, so you want to be able to evaluate the message that you're hearing. %$* 268
and part of being able to evaluate that is knowing who's speaking. %$* 268
jonathan, i have to step in because we hit our time limit. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 268
and i want to say, that's the conclusion of round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
here's where we are. %$* 13
we're about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
these will be two minutes, each. %$* 13
it is their chance-- %$* 13
their last chance to try to affect how you will vote at the end of this debate. %$* 13
remember, you voted before the debate and we're going to ask you to vote again at the end on this motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." so on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
here to speak against the motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated," trevor potter. %$* 13
he is president and general counsel of the campaign legal center. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 267
i'd like you to imagine a state where industrial hog operators began to worry about proposed new environmental regulations that would prevent them from dumping untreated waste into local rivers. %$* 267
imagine they formed a group called, say, "farmers for fairness," to persuade legislators to block such regulation. %$* 267
imagine they created some campaign ads which attacked legislators by name, never mentioning hog farming at all, but claiming legislators were not in touch with "our values." but now imagine that farmers for fairness did not go out and run these ads, but instead scheduled meetings with legislators and screened the advertisements for them in private. %$* 267
imagine farmers for fairness told the legislators privately that they would hate to run these ads, but would do so if the legislators didn't vote the way they wanted. %$* 267
you don't have to imagine that. %$* 267
it happened in north carolina, documented by a federal judge in a case called life v. %$* 267
leake. %$* 267
but today a super pac nonprofit could do this in congress with huge sums of unlimited, undisclosed money at their disposal, and we might never know it happened. %$* 267
two cheers for super pacs? %$* 267
i don't think so. %$* 267
that would be a problem even if the super pacs complied with the supreme court's assumptions about no coordination at all with candidates and party committees and full disclosure of all this money being spent in elections. %$* 267
that is not the system we need. %$* 267
thank you, trevor potter. %$* 13
our motion is, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, jacob sullum, a senior editor at reason magazine. %$* 13
so during the first round of arguments in citizens united, deputy solicitor general malcolm stewart was asked, "well, if you can ban this movie, 'hillary: the movie,' what about if you have very similar material but it was presented in a different medium, like dvds or on the internet or even in books? %$* 266
"and he said, "that would be constitutionally permissible too." this was pretty shocking, because it raised the possibility that the government could ban books in the name of fighting corruption. %$* 266
it was widely seen as the turning point in the case. %$* 266
they had a second round of oral arguments, which was very unusual, prompted largely by this revelation. %$* 266
and during that round, the solicitor general, elena kagan, said the government had changed its answer. %$* 266
she said there would be a strong constitutional case against punishing an organization for publishing a book, but that pamphlets were different because they were classic electioneering. %$* 266
well, that raised new questions. %$* 266
when does a pamphlet become a book? %$* 266
is it a matter of the number of pages? %$* 266
is it the kind of cover it has, the binding, or what? %$* 266
now, the media exemption that i alluded to before, upon close examination, looks equally arbitrary. %$* 266
citizens united, after all, was producing movies. %$* 266
so why was that, citizens united, not a media corporation? %$* 266
the nra started a radio show, daily radio show, after mccain-feingold was passed, and they said, "look, we're a media corporation; we're exempt." if that's legitimate, then why couldn't every advocacy group do the same sort of thing? %$* 266
does the internet count as a medium? %$* 266
presumably it does. %$* 266
then doesn't every group that has a website qualify as a media corporation? %$* 266
this media exemption puts the government in the position of deciding who deserves to have unfettered freedom of speech and who does not, which is precisely the sort of distinctions the first amendment is supposed to prohibit. %$* 266
and whether you're worried about corruption or you're worried about undue influence, the arguments for regulation are just as strong, if not stronger, in the case of media corporations. %$* 266
so while many of my fellow journalists have supported these kinds of regulations, basically lobbying to keep their own special speech privileges, it's always seemed foolish to me for people who make a living by talking about politics to appoint the government as a sort of national debate moderator, because you never know when the moderator will decide that it's time for you to shut up. %$* 266
your time is up, jacob sullum. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
our motion, "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." and here to summarize his position against the motion, jonathan soros, senior fellow at the roosevelt institute and cofounder of friends of democracy. %$* 13
so i'm going to return to this question of scott's miracle-gro, because what's not part of the story yet is that last week scott's was fined $12.5 million for violations of federal pesticide laws for, among other things, putting toxic insecticide in their bird seed that was killing birds. %$* 268
now, they got caught doing that, and they actually as far as i could tell, acted admirably. %$* 268
they admitted it. %$* 268
they pled guilty. %$* 268
they entered into an agreement. %$* 268
but they were caught, and that was dealt with because we have laws that protect clean elections-- %$* 268
excuse me-- %$* 268
laws that protect clean air and clean water, and we have an enforcement agency that deals with that. %$* 268
in june, they gave $200,000 to the pro-romney super pac restore our future. %$* 268
this is not that it was romney or obama, but that they gave money to a super pac.there are no laws in place after citizens united, no clear legal regime that would require them to disclose that information so that their consumers would know about it, so that their shareholders would know about it, that anybody else would know about it. %$* 268
they could have used a different organization other than the super pac and done basically the same thing. %$* 268
and we have no effective regulatory agency that will provide us with clean elections. %$* 268
a lot of what our opponents have talked about essentially arguing from the past. %$* 268
they're arguing from pre-citizens united, pre-speechnow. %$* 268
we deserve disclosure of contributions. %$* 268
we deserve an effective disclosure regime. %$* 268
we deserve something that protects our-- %$* 268
the integrity of our political process. %$* 268
the proposition that we're arguing is whether money in politics is still overregulated, and the answer to that is clearly no. %$* 268
thank you, jonathan soros. %$* 13
the motion: "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, david keating, president of the center for competitive politics. %$* 13
well, since we passed the major campaign finance restrictions in the early 1970s, we've seen competition decline dramatically. %$* 265
we used to see elections that were far more competitive than they are today. %$* 265
the re-election rate has gone up not down. %$* 265
but fundamentally i think what we have to keep in mind here is when-- %$* 265
who is going to write these restrictions? %$* 265
who is going to write the campaign finance laws and regulations? %$* 265
well, the answer is it's going to be the incumbent members of congress. %$* 265
there is no other way to write them. %$* 265
and if there is ever a conflict of interest about how this is going to be written, that's a conflict. %$* 265
they get to write the regulations so they probably will write them so that they will be able to have a better chance at keeping their jobs. %$* 265
they're not so much concerned about our freedom of speech or our ability to criticize the job they're doing. %$* 265
in fact, they would like to see less criticism of it. %$* 265
so basically, this is a debate about who decides what you can say? %$* 265
should it be us the people getting together and deciding, or should it be the politicians? %$* 265
and should it be the prosecutors who are looking to make a name for themselves? %$* 265
you have to keep in mind many of these laws that are written not only have civil penalties but criminal penalties. %$* 265
and if you think that's far-fetched, the very first political prosecution taken under these laws was a group that took out a full-page ad urging nixon's impeachment for the invasion of cambodia. %$* 265
that was the first prosecution under the campaign finance laws. %$* 265
i would say free speech is messy. %$* 265
but the cure of additional regulations written by politicians who want to stay in office is worse than any disease of free speech. %$* 265
so i hope you will support the motion "two cheers, or three cheers, for super pacs." three cheers for independent action by the people. %$* 265
thank you, david keating. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you and the audience feel has-- %$* 13
feels has voted the best. %$* 13
we are asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
we're going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
the motion is "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." if you feel this side argued best, push number one. %$* 13
the opposing side, push number two. %$* 13
if you are or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys and correct your vote, and it will just register the last vote. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so while you're doing that, and while the votes are being tabulated, the first thing i want to say is that this was, for us, relaunching this season in the midst of a political campaign, it was just about a perfect-- %$* 13
just about a perfect target for us. %$* 13
and i think all of us at intelligence squared are really, really impressed by the level of debate that these panelists brought to this. %$* 13
it was very serious and informational without being medicinal. %$* 13
it was terrific. %$* 13
so thank you for that. %$* 13
and also, i want to say sometimes we have some tricky times with audience questions. %$* 13
questions tonight were terrific. %$* 13
so to everybody who got up there and had the nerve, thank you very much for that. %$* 13
few things about what's coming down the road. %$* 13
first of all, we-- %$* 13
anybody who was tweeting tonight, thank you for that. %$* 13
and you are welcomed and encouraged by us to tweet after the debate and get the word out about us. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us.and the hash tag is the same, #iq2us.our next debate is on thursday, october 4.the motion is "better elected islamists than dictators." arguing in support of this motion we're going to have reuel marc gerecht, a senior fellow at the foundation for defensive democracies and a former middle east specialist; brian katulis, he is a senior fellow at the center for american progress, who has been focusing on u.s.foreign policy in the middle east and south asia. %$* 13
arguing against this motion, daniel pipes. %$* 13
he is president of the middle east forum. %$* 13
he is described as perhaps the most prominent u.s. scholar on radical islam by the washington post. %$* 13
and zuhdi jasser, he is president of the american islamic forum for democracy which he founded to advocate for the separation of mosque and state. %$* 13
october 10th, everybody get on a plane and fly to chicago because we're going to be doing a debate there. %$* 13
we're taking part in the second annual chicago ideas week. %$* 13
there we are debating the motion, "ration end of life care." i may later pronounce it "ration." i haven't decided yet. %$* 13
but you get the point. %$* 13
tickets and more information about all of the upcoming fall debates can be found on our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and if you can't make it to the next debate, watch the live stream as we had tonight. %$* 13
our new partner is the wall street journal's video initiative, wsj live. %$* 13
and you-- %$* 13
as i said at the very beginning, you can listen to all of our debates online. %$* 13
and this particular debate on wnyc here in new york. %$* 13
our turnaround time is usually several days. %$* 13
and just look at their schedule. %$* 13
and also for the televised version, wnet and the world digital channel. %$* 13
all right, we have the results in. %$* 13
remember, our motion is this: "two cheers for super pacs: money in politics is still overregulated." you heard the heated and intelligent arguments. %$* 13
we've asked you to vote twice, both before the debate and again at the end of the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
and it goes like this: before the debate, 19 percent were for the motion, 63 percent were against, 18 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 22 percent are for the motion. %$* 13
that's up 3 percent. %$* 13
69 percent are against. %$* 13
that is up 6 percent, 9 percent are undecided. %$* 13
that's down 9 percent. %$* 13
that means that the side arguing against the motion in a squeaker has carried this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donovan. %$* 13
we'll see you next time from intelligence squared us. %$* 13

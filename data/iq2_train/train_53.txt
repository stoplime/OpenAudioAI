and an attempt, and i think interestingly, the other side did not use its strongest argument. %$* 246
free trade, our buying from overseas, helps those poor countries, where wages are really low. %$* 246
i think as decent human beings we should all be for them, look what’s rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.happened. %$* 246
it hasn’t gotten to them for the most part. %$* 246
it hasn’t gotten to them in nearly the amount it should. %$* 246
we’ve got to think much more broadly about this issue, thank you. %$* 246
thank you, jeff madrick, and that concludes opening statements in this debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator for this intelligence squared us debate, our motion is “buy american-hire american policies will backfire,” we have six panelists, three arguing for the motion and three against, now before the debate we polled our live audience here on where they stood on this debate, and i now have the results and we’ll report them and once again, the motion is, “buy american-hire american policies will backfire,” before the debate, 57 percent of you agree with the motion, 20 percent of you were against the motion, and 23 percent were undecided. %$* 13
we will poll you again at the end of the debate and the side that has moved the most votes, that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now on to round 2, in round 2, the debaters speak directly to one another, they can question one another, they will also take questions from us, myself and you in the audience will have the opportunity in just a minutes, we have ushers with microphones. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, catch my attention, we will get a microphone to you, i urge you again, please, to resist the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.temptation to make long speeches. %$* 13
and if you are a member of the press, we would prefer that you identify yourself. %$* 13
doug irwin of dartmouth college, you are arguing for the motion that buy american will backfire, you actually went as far as saying it has already backfired. %$* 13
i heard your opponent on the other side, rick macarthur, and his colleagues, argue repeatedly that buy american works, and buy our own stuff works for lots of other countries who are doing it already, that’s why they do it. %$* 13
rick macarthur cited mexico, it has worked for mexico. %$* 13
if it works for mexico, why not make the argument that it works here as well. %$* 13
well i wouldn’t grant the premise that it worked for mexico, in fact, what did that lead to. %$* 241
huge debt crisis in 1982, huge collapse of the growing middle class, huge economic problems which is one reason why they chose to embrace economic openness after the early 1980s. %$* 241
but actually, jeff madrick raised an important point too. %$* 241
there’s been tremendous economic growth in india. %$* 241
tremendous economic growth in china. %$* 241
the biggest change in the globe has been happening in those regions, where there’s hundreds of millions of people moving into the middle class. %$* 241
they’re able to do that because of trade openness. %$* 241
and yes— %$* 241
they’re able to do that because it’s a mercantilist policy, doug. %$* 242
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
oh, so china— %$* 241
they’re able to do that because they subsidize their market, they’re able to do that because they manipulate their currency. %$* 242
they’re able to do that because of the article that the ceo of— chinese ceo of suntech power says that they’re going to sell their products in america, at lower than the cost of production. %$* 242
the issue— %$* 241
and they get away with it because— %$* 242
excuse me, leo. %$* 245
—bec—i’m not finished, let me— and they get— %$* 242
well, i wasn’t finished either. %$* 241
well— %$* 242
well— %$* 13
i was told i could interrupt you when you were wrong, doug. %$* 242
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. i’m glad leo gerard of the steelworkers union jumped in because one of the points that was raised by your opponents, as you argue against this motion, that buy american will backfire, they raise the argument that, steel products from abroad may be better and may be cheaper, and why should americans have to pay more for their steel if they can get it better and cheaper abroad. %$* 13
well, first of all it’s certainly not better and in some cases it is cheaper, but i come back to the point that doug raised about the bay bridge. %$* 242
we have red lead in steel, that we’ve had to ship back because, we banned red lead in america 30 years ago because of its health hazards. %$* 242
so we— %$* 242
could—can you explain what that is for people that don’t know the term, very quickly— %$* 13
red lead is the most toxic form of lead, they used to be put in pipes because it’s malleable. %$* 242
you can maneuver it. %$* 242
we banned it because red lead is so dangerous. %$* 242
and we pay a price for doing that, we pay a price for clean water, we pay a price for all those things in the kind of society that we want. %$* 242
we found that china was shipping steel pipes with radiation in it because they were rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.doing it from melted pipes with radioactive material in it, and shipping it. %$* 242
we found that, as i said this, and i %$* 242
but that—that’s an argument that you can buy junky stuff abroad. %$* 13
well, that— %$* 242
and,— %$* 13
—well that’s—but doug, there are, that’s the argument, that we have a set of laws and rules and we’re a rules-based trading system, but we’re the only one right now playing by the rules. %$* 242
you know, i— %$* 241
and, and if we’re a rules-based trading system they ought to be playing by the rules too— %$* 242
let me hear from the side for the motion in response to that. %$* 13
well— there’s nothing which prevents you from applying safety standards and we are doing that all the time. %$* 243
so the fact that some chinese imports or any other rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.imports, including our exports, get caught in the safety net doesn’t mean that buy american is good. %$* 243
i mean that’s simply a non-sequitur. %$* 243
but what it does— %$* 242
the issue being—i’m sorry— %$* 245
—is that—what it does is it adds costs because we have rules, now you come to us and say, well your costs are higher. %$* 242
—leo— %$* 245
but we have rules— %$* 242
—le— %$* 245
—susan schwab— %$* 13
leo, and i’m, and i would note, doug never got a chance to finish what he was saying— %$* 245
i’m glad you’re standing up for him— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.i got that. %$* 245
no, i mean the point is, we can get off on this long tangent about chinese trade policies, first of all, that is not the issue at hand. %$* 245
the resolution talks about buy american policies, hire american policies, will backfire. %$* 245
they will backfire, they have backfired, that’s what we’re voting about. %$* 245
but in terms of china, i have taken on chinese trade practices, and we’ve got legislation to do that. %$* 245
we took six cases against the chinese in the bush administration, we won or settled every one of those cases, got rid of illegal chinese subsidies, we managed to get the markets where they were artificially closing them. %$* 245
but— %$* 246
there are—i’m sorry. %$* 245
there are statutes for anti-dumping, there’s statutes for countervailing duties, there are lots and lots of statutes. %$* 245
buy american legislation does not resolve any— %$* 245
but you’re not— %$* 246
—single one of— %$* 245
jeff— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.—the issues, excuse me— %$* 245
and the problem with that is dumping— %$* 246
—but the other side’s been talking back— %$* 245
jeff madrick from the other side— %$* 13
dumping goes on, subsidies go on in this recession, by all reports i’ve heard. %$* 246
china is really pushing out the exports as, uh, uh, as, and some of the practices are open, this is part of what i mean— this is what i’m talking about about this oversimplification. %$* 246
that, and i have great respect for %$* 246
jagdish who i consider a friend, but, to say that we can handle these issues in the international labor organization, or through agreements we make with china, disregarding the reality of the world, i am—we’re not even close to fighting a trade war. %$* 246
the, we’re—it’s not even close. %$* 246
china needs us, we need them, we’ve got to start dealing with the reality of what’s happened to wages in america. %$* 246
and doug, things have become extremely imbalanced in this world you’re describing of china and india— %$* 246
let’s let doug irwin in now— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. extremely imbalanced— %$* 246
that’s great— %$* 241
—and in fact— %$* 246
doug irwin of dartmouth college. %$* 13
i’m actually one of the few trade economists who believes the trade deficit has become a problem. %$* 241
so the question is how do you deal with it. %$* 241
buy american will not deal with it, it’s not the right approach. %$* 241
why do we have a huge trade deficit with china. %$* 241
what do we do with our dollars in the united states. %$* 241
70 percent of us gdp is consumption. %$* 241
70 percent. %$* 241
what is the share of consumption in china. %$* 241
30 percent. %$* 241
they are a high-savings country, we are a low-savings country. %$* 241
we are a high- consumption country, they’re a low-consumption country. %$* 241
that is the ultimate source— %$* 241
yeah— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 246
—of the trade deficit— %$* 241
—you know— %$* 246
it’s not unfair trade practices, it’s not all this other stuff— %$* 241
you know, one way to get to— %$* 246
we have to save more as a country, and china has to— %$* 241
—consume more. %$* 241
and—you know, and doug is %$* 246
jeff, let me bring in your colleagues, we haven’t heard from them %$* 13
as long as you give me a chance— %$* 246
no, sorry, rick, rick macarthur, come on in. %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 13
well i never got to— i ran outta time so i wasn’t able to make my main argument which has to do with what kind of a country you want to live in. %$* 244
obviously, using tariffs and buy american provisions are artificial methods that you install in an economy to, we hope, maintain wages at a relatively high level so we can run a civilized society, we haven’t had one exchange yet about the exploitation of cheap labor in china or mexico. %$* 244
and when i talk about when i have arguments with my friends in the economics departments of these various universities, i have to ask myself if they’ve ever met a factory worker, have they ever talked to a steelworker or to an autoworker or to an electrical worker who’s lost their job, because the united states has been pursuing pro-buy foreign policies for the last 15 years, that’s what we have now with nafta, and the permanent normal trade relations with china. %$* 244
these are, as professor bhagwati will be the first to acknowledge, preferential trade agreements, not free trade agreements, and, something has to be done on our side to compensate for these tremendous advantages, given to foreign manufacturers. %$* 244
yes, some of it is low-end manufacturing but not all of it is low-end manufacturing. %$* 244
and in order to redress this tremendous trade imbalance there are various methods at our disposal. %$* 244
tariffs, buy american provisions, et cetera, et cetera. %$* 244
but to go on talking as if there is a free trade system in place rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.that’s being threatened is preposterous. %$* 244
if you look at nafta and pntr they’re much closer, and this is a corporate lawyer who first explained it to me when i explained to him how the labor market works between the united states and mexico and the united states and china, it’s more like a labor racketeering agreement. %$* 244
that is a conspiracy to fix the price of labor as low as possible, certainly to benefit certain, uh, shareholders in certain american corporations, but not to benefit american workers or to defend— %$* 244
rick, let— %$* 13
—what we used to call the american way of life— %$* 244
i want to cut in— %$* 13
if you want to keep driving wages down, yes, let’s keep pursuing a non-buy american policy, and let’s— %$* 244
so, so— %$* 13
—keep outsourcing— %$* 244
—so this critique seems to say to the side arguing for the motion rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. that free trade as you describe it is a farce. %$* 13
well, let us note again, you’re going to come back and remind everyone what this debate is actually supposed to be about, buy american, hire american. %$* 245
but, the other side is meandering, i want to go in that direction and talk about trade agreements because what rick has been saying about trade agreements, just isn’t borne out by the facts. %$* 245
if you look at the free trade agreements, and, forgive me, jagdish, i know you hate free trade agreements. %$* 245
if you look at the agreements that we’ve negotiated, you find that us exports to our trade agreement partners have gone up 40 percent faster, than our— %$* 245
they are fake exports— %$* 244
40 percent— %$* 245
madam. %$* 244
—faster—fake exports? %$* 245
go talk to g.e. and caterpillar— %$* 245
jeff— %$* 242
—and, ups— %$* 245
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. soviet union—susan, jeff, susan, jeff— %$* 242
let me finish a thought— %$* 245
point of order, you gotta really— %$* 244
let me—let me finish the thought— %$* 245
you can’t say this. %$* 244
you can, you had— %$* 245
well this is not true— %$* 242
like to respond— %$* 246
utter nonsense. %$* 244
i’ll let you respond— %$* 13
let—let me just, let me just finish— %$* 245
i—i want in on this, okay— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
do. %$* 13
i can say it because it is a fact and in fact if you just look at the trade agreements that we negotiated during the bush administration us exports have gone up 80 percent faster to those countries than the rest of the world. %$* 245
nafta.nafta was raised, this—i know this debate’s not about nafta, but— and i didn’t negotiate nafta, nafta went through during the clinton administration. %$* 245
but you know what? %$* 245
if you look at the statistics in the 10 years before nafta and the 10 years after, you discover, that the 10 years after nafta passed, us unemployment was lower, us employment was higher, us economic growth was higher after nafta. so all of this, these scare tactics— %$* 245
ohhh. %$* 247
—um, excuse me, do not %$* 245
all right, your— %$* 13
—reflect reality— %$* 245
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.—your opponents are conferring and they want to speak, i first want to get the process of questions from the audience and i will come to that—you on that point, before we get to the questions, i just want to get it moving. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, i’d like to move a microphone over to you. %$* 13
if you go up the aisle, gentleman in the blue shirt, you will be next, i want to give you a chance to respond to what susan schwab just said— %$* 13
oh, very quickly the, you’ve heard the— %$* 244
rick macarthur— %$* 13
—you’ve heard the expression industrial tourism i’m sure. %$* 244
the surge in exports from united states to mexico are fake exports, it’s us sending components to mexico for assembly, and we’re counting those as exports and they come right back into the united states for sale. %$* 244
we’re even at the point now where we’re, we’re sending oranges to mexico to be packed, and then shipped back into the united states, we’re calling those exports, they’re fake exports, they’re not—there’s no added value to speak of in those exports. %$* 244
and the people who used to do those assembly jobs, those relatively low-paid assembly jobs, have lost their jobs. %$* 244
more than half a million, probably a million if we count honestly, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.since nafta was passed, and this is a government statistic. %$* 244
so, instead of having somebody making $10 an hour or $11 an hour packing oranges in florida, it’s now being packed for $1.30 an hour in mexico, we’re counting that as an export when it’s not an export. %$* 244
leo gerard, you’re— %$* 13
the— %$* 242
it’s a phony export. %$* 244
leo gerard of the steelworkers— %$* 13
two—couple of quick points. %$* 242
and i could give susan the point that our exports have gone up, but our imports, more than doubled. %$* 242
so we—when we signed—we could do nafta.when we signed nafta we had a slight trade surplus with mexico. %$* 242
10 years after nafta we’ve had record trade deficits year after year with mexico. %$* 242
when we did pntr trade with china was relatively in balance, only a couple of hundred million dollars either way. %$* 242
we’re now setting record trade deficit with china, china’s trade deficit year over year, is 70 percent of our overall trade deficit. %$* 242
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
today we have a— %$* 245
what—let— %$* 242
—manufactured— %$* 245
let me finish— %$* 242
—let him finish, susan. %$* 13
and the one thing that we were told, we need to get trained for these high-tech computer jobs, well you know what? %$* 242
we’ve now got a deficit in advanced-technology products, so the high-end jobs that we were told we would train for are gone. %$* 242
national association of manufacturers has shown us— %$* 245
they’re the multi-national spokesmen— %$* 242
—that us trade balance with our fta partners, is now in surplus— %$* 245
oh, that’s craziness— %$* 242
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.—in manufactured goods. %$* 245
well— %$* 242
if you look— %$* 245
susan— %$* 242
i’m sorry, let me just— %$* 245
i’m going to stop this because we have a dispute over the facts at this point that can’t be settled here— %$* 13
they love cheap labor— %$* 244
—and i want to go to the gentleman— %$* 13
they love cheap labor there— %$* 244
—in the blue jacket. %$* 13
gentleman in the blue jacket. %$* 13
it can— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
on our motion that— %$* 13
—it can be settled— %$* 242
—hire american, buy american policies with backfire, and please stand up, sir— %$* 13
we’ve got a trade surplus, how did we end up with a trade deficit. %$* 242
audience member (male) thank you. %$* 242
mr. %$* 13
gerard. %$* 13
audience member (male) as a colombian manufacturer, i would be on the side of the protectionists %$* 13
a hundred percent because if not, we’ll be run out of business. %$* 13
the fact is that one of the us manufacturers, with 1 percent of its yearly production, would run us out of the whole mark—of the whole colombian market. %$* 13
so we think that it’s dangerous for us, and we think that the policy of subsidies does exist in the united states which it doesn’t in colombia, and as such, i should be a protectionist. %$* 13
to be intellectually honest however— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.sir, i need you to get to a question, please. %$* 13
with respect— audience member (male) just very briefly, i have— %$* 13
it was—i really need you to get to the question— audience member (male) i have no doubt, that it’s good for our country to sign a free trade agreement. %$* 13
so, the question to, mrs., trade representative— %$* 13
schwab, susan schwab— audience member i’m sorry, is, why, if i think you believe that what i’m stating is true, why has it not been signed. %$* 13
do i answer that now— %$* 245
yes. %$* 13
the colombia-us free trade agreement was, uh, signed over two years ago, three— close to three years ago now. %$* 245
it would benefit both countries, the independent international trade commission has told us that us exports would go up to colombia, colombia’s exports would go up to the united states. %$* 245
in fact, because rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.colombia has preferential access to the us market now, us exports would go up to colombia even faster than colombia’s exports to the united states, but colombia would derive new foreign direct investment. %$* 245
we made all of these arguments on capitol hill. %$* 245
the democratic leadership reached an agreement with the democratic leadership in 2007 to add special labor and environmental protections to that agreement, after it had been signed and was very grateful that the government of colombia was willing to incorporate that in the agreement. %$* 245
and lo and behold, the democratic leadership in the congress decided they just didn’t want to move the legislation. %$* 245
and a legislative process that has worked for the united states since 1974, was turned on its head, when the speaker of the house refused to allow a vote on the colombia free trade agreement when we knew the votes were there, in the house and in the senate to pass it. %$* 245
in two sentences— %$* 13
john, can i— %$* 245
—what’s the lesson related to our motion tonight? %$* 13
it—well, this— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 245
perhaps none. %$* 13
the—well, i mean the,— %$* 245
actually there is. %$* 241
it’s that— %$* 241
no, this is a— %$* 243
they’re right, there isn’t— %$* 241
doug irwin— %$* 13
—free trade in the world, because colombia has very high tariffs against our goods, and we allow them duty-free access to our market. %$* 241
so it’s very much unfair and the colombia fta would’ve evened that play—leveled that playing field. %$* 241
i can answer that question now, sorry, now that i’ve thought about it—in terms of buy american, here we’re talking about buy american this, buy american that. %$* 245
our trading partners, canada, europe, are negotiating free trade agreements with colombia, so that they can have preferential access and lock our guys out, that’s what’s happening— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 245
and not signing. %$* 242
question from the— %$* 13
you know, i just have to cut in here because i’d love to hear jagdish bhagwati on bilateral trade agreements. %$* 246
and this may be a little too theoretical but bilateral trade agreements are anathema to true free-trade theorists for the most part. %$* 246
they do not— it’s not about comparative advantage. %$* 246
it’s about political bullying and political favoritism and all the fta’s are going to do is exactly what susan said they’re going to do. %$* 246
they’re going to bring in uncompetitive fta’s, and we’re going to have a trade war in that sense, and i have the sense that— %$* 246
john, i just want to %$* 242
go back to— %$* 242
yeah, go ahead, leo— %$* 13
—i want to go back to the point that i was cut off making, a minute ago. %$* 242
that,— %$* 242
well— %$* 246
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.—when susan made that point that all of the trading agreements that we’ve negotiated are all in surplus. %$* 242
no, no, that’s not what i said— %$* 245
i can’t make—i can’t do the math. %$* 246
that’s not what i said— %$* 245
we’re in fact running, a $6.5 trillion accumulated trade debt since 1994.we’ve been setting record trade deficits year after year, and including in the last four years, a trade deficit in advanced-technology products. %$* 242
the— when we lost the industrial base of america, we lose the creativity and the innovation and the engineering all of the stuff that takes us to the next level. %$* 242
and right now we’re hollowed out to the point where, jeff immelt, that susan referred to at g.e., has now publicly said that we’ve gone too far with this, we’ve outsourced too much, and we’ve gotta go back and rebuild the manufacturing base and america needs an industrial strategy that will favor america. %$* 242
jeff isn’t a left-wing trade unionist by any stretch of the imagination. %$* 242
can i— %$* 246
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. he also doesn’t— %$* 245
i’m going to go up to the gentleman in the middle, and i really want to hear a question. %$* 13
audience member (male) i have one %$* 13
i would like to ask the question to the side that is arguing for the motion, do you—i’m right here. %$* 13
for the motion that buy american will backfire. %$* 13
audience member (male) sorry—hi. %$* 13
i was wondering if you’re okay with the fact that the overwhelming majority of our economy is driven by consumerism. %$* 13
if you’re not okay with that, then wouldn’t it be a plus for us to then instill some sort of buy american, hire american policies. %$* 13
if that’s a no, then wouldn’t that lead to an economy that’s more reliant on consumerism, as it already is overwhelmingly. %$* 13
in the context of that, i’d like to say to professor irwin— %$* 13
i’m going to stop you there ‘cause i want it to be— audience member %$* 13
—one question and you’ve actually got several clauses in there— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. audience member (male) no, no, in the context of that i would like— %$* 13
—i’m, i’m going to stop you, sir— audience member (male)—to say that you’re— %$* 13
jagdish, can you take that question, please— audience member (male) i’m sorry, that, also there’s— %$* 13
um— %$* 243
go ahead, go ahead. %$* 13
there’s somebody talking, i—? %$* 243
yeah, i’m asking him to— i don’t mean to be rude— %$* 13
maybe he’s answering the question— %$* 243
—i just want to move it along and it was multi-part and it’s too complicated— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. audience member (male) %$* 13
go— %$* 13
i couldn’t quite get at what exactly the, he was driving at. %$* 243
but let me just get back very quickly to jeff madrick’s question— free trade agreements, i totally disagree with what susan said, i don’t know whether it’s kosher to disagree. %$* 243
but, i mean, the preferential trade agreements are between us as a major power, with little guys in different parts of the world, relatively except for south korea. %$* 243
and if you look at any— %$* 243
australia—? %$* 245
—free trade agreement— %$* 243
singapore— %$* 245
—it’s about that big, it consists of all kinds of atrocities being perpetrated on the smaller countries. %$* 243
and i think it pretends to be a trade agreement but is actually a trade—a non-trade agreement and i think, we need to get away from these rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. altogether, and get back to the multilateral trading system. %$* 243
i think we have a— %$* 245
another question from the audience— %$* 13
it— we apparently have a— %$* 245
—gentleman in the white shirt, please. %$* 13
right behind you? %$* 13
audience member (male) i’ll try and keep it short. %$* 13
i believe that america’s a capitalist country, and capitalism rewards people who are more efficient, and people who can give you more for less. %$* 13
so, if these foreign countries can produce steel, like pasco in korea can produce steel better than us steel or nucor can, then why are we going to reward mediocrity, why are we going to reward the inefficiency of the american system, when we can get—when we should get incentives to the american companies to become as efficient as these foreign companies— %$* 13
who— %$* 242
let’s give that question to the leo gerard of the steelworkers— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.the problem with that question, is it’s living in facts that were probably from the 1970s and early ‘80s. %$* 242
and the fact is— %$* 242
—the—well %$* 242
by the time we got to the economic collapse of last fall, last year %$* 242
american steel was the cheapest of any major industrial country and american steel sold in america, was cheaper than chinese steel sold in china. %$* 242
and the reason for that is that china doesn’t have sufficient raw material. %$* 242
but china went %$* 242
think about this if we talk about a sort of a level playing field. %$* 242
from two thousand and three, roughly late 2002, to 2007, china went from being able to produce 150 million tons of steel, to 500 million tons of steel. %$* 242
in a traditional system using traditional finance, they could’ve never generated enough profits and they could’ve never accessed enough capital markets to make that kind of investment to do that to their industry, in a period of roughly five years. %$* 242
that was done because they got subsidies, they got cheap money, they got free land, they got no enforcement, they got free transportation, they got export subsidies, when they exported stuff to us they got the money back, and they generated that, and it’s a mercantilist system, i’m not angry at china— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
i would be %$* 243
i’m not angry at china— %$* 242
—they decided to do that so they could grow their steel industry, we decided to punish our steel industry, and reward those that take jobs offshore with giving them tax breaks. %$* 242
it is %$* 243
okay, the side for the motion wants to respond to that— %$* 13
but we pay a lot of subsidies too— %$* 243
jagdish bhagwati— %$* 13
—at usually the state and local level. %$* 243
they are up to huge amounts, people like mayor bloomberg even announced with great glee that we managed to attract industry to new york, and all the governors compete for it also. %$* 243
so i think actually, we don’t have clean hands either, so you know, for us to say, others are rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. subsidizing and we are not— %$* 243
i was just dealing with the steel question— %$* 242
—doesn’t make any sense— %$* 243
—he asked—he asked me a steel question, i don’t think we ought to subsidize each other at all. %$* 242
okay, i want, i— %$* 13
can i just ask, what do you mean, capitalism is %$* 244
who told you capitalism is efficient. %$* 244
what do, i’d like to hear him, may—could, you pretend you’re defending your doctoral thesis. %$* 244
and i’d be happy to argue that capitalism can be enormously inefficient, it can tend towards monopoly, it can tend towards monopolistic practices. %$* 244
we’ve just been through a supposed— %$* 244
i agree— %$* 13
—boom— %$* 244
i agree— john, it’s a wonderful thesis question but we ought— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. audience member (male) well, i really said that— %$* 13
come on, sir, let’s move on— audience member (male)—is where we are— %$* 13
—to the— %$* 13
and at what cost—at what cost— %$* 244
—as you— %$* 247
john, please— %$* 13
yeah, thanks. %$* 244
as you rise i want to remind you that we’re in the q-and-a section, of our %$* 13
intelligence squared debate— %$* 13
we’re just in the a section— %$* 244
—i’m john donvan, your moderator %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.the motion is that, hire american, buy american policies will backfire, ma’am, your question, please. %$* 13
audience member (female) we’re at nyu at the moment that happens to have a very modern little faculty, with global faculty, global students. %$* 13
and i think they know something. %$* 13
america is a big, complex influential place. %$* 13
it’s the epicenter of financial crisis, it’s in the middle of political and social change. %$* 13
and i think america needs to tell it to the world. %$* 13
i was wondering if the opposition have admitted from the start that they’re at most only half-right in this debate, or will they defend the hire american policy. %$* 13
are they— %$* 246
the question is were you— %$* 13
you know, i’m intri— %$* 246
—you’re, you’re not just talking about buy american but hire american— %$* 13
yeah, i’m intrigued, you seem to think that that america— %$* 246
jeff madrick— %$* 13
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.—the implication of what you’re saying is that the credit crisis was somehow caused by people who don’t believe in market processes. %$* 246
the credit crisis was caused, i think, most believe people, or at least in large part, was caused, because of lack of government intervention, and because of the inefficiencies, and unfairness, of unfettered free markets. %$* 246
the free trade policies— audience member (male) you’re off the topic! %$* 246
i’m not off the topic, that’s what she just asked— audience member (male) no she didn’t. %$* 246
have some constraint and listen. %$* 246
can i just— audience member (female) yeah— %$* 246
jeff, you can take it. %$* 13
i believe you’re wrong, sir, and i’m going to continue. %$* 246
okay? %$* 246
but jeff— %$* 247
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s.the point is that we—america is responsible for much of that credit crisis, because it believed in free-market theory. %$* 246
now, free trade theory, is a precise analogy to efficient market financial theory. %$* 246
it argues that all these markets in the world work very efficiently like this fellow has said. %$* 246
if korea makes something efficiently why shouldn’t we reward them. %$* 246
well, their wages are very low, but are they making something, are there more incentives, should we have an incentive battle? %$* 246
so, are we—do we argue that, trade is good? %$* 246
i think all three of us argue that trade is good. %$* 246
do we argue that it’s become unbalanced, that this is tipped over far too much, that evidence of wages in america doing so poorly, is clear. %$* 246
that’s what i— %$* 246
can i get back to the question? %$* 243
please do. %$* 13
fair enough, fair call. %$* 13
let me just say that, i’m myself an immigrant, okay? %$* 243
i don’t think i’ve done much harm to this country. %$* 243
i think mr. %$* 243
gerard, a great %$* 243
you know, description that you were a canadian— %$* 243
i don’t think i’ve done much harm either— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
that you were a canadian and i— maybe you’ve done harm to this country but i— i think you should defend it yourself. %$* 243
but i do think, that this country as susan, you know, eloquently pointed out has done enormously well, as a result of immigration. %$* 243
and i think— %$* 243
no, no— %$* 242
—to indulge in, you know— %$* 243
listen, this is %$* 242
—hiring aliens last, firing them first, the sort of movements which are going on, are extremely un-american and also extremely inefficient. %$* 243
we have really prospered on the %$* 243
i mean— %$* 243
no, no, i want to— %$* 242
all right, leo %$* 13
leo gerard—take that on. %$* 13
i don’t know where this argument came from, that i don’t know anyone who’s against immigration. %$* 242
but what— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 242
—what i am against, what i am against, is when microsoft will want to bring in engineers from india, that will work for $12,000, while they’re laying off computer engineers that were getting paid $60,000. %$* 242
well— %$* 243
and want to use the visa system to do that. %$* 242
i don’t think— %$* 242
um— %$* 243
—i don’t think that that’s right. %$* 242
now i’m all for, obviously, as you are— %$* 242
yeah— %$* 243
i’m all for the ability to come here, and work within the system that is but don’t use me to come in and drive down wages of computer engineers or anyone else. %$* 242
yeah, but let— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence squared u.s. %$* 243
that’s the argument— %$* 242
—let me just explain one thing in contradiction of that— %$* 243
and by the way i haven’t done anything wrong, i haven’t damaged anybody. %$* 242
well, i’m glad you say that— %$* 243
jagdish bhagwati— %$* 13
yet. %$* 242
uh— i hope you’re able to persuade others about— in this audience— when intel, bill gates, et cetera, go out and get people from say india, the vast majority of those people are fantastically able, they’re trained at the best institutions— %$* 243
absolutely— %$* 242

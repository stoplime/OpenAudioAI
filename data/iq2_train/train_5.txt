there are some who believe that you should carry human rights on the top of the banner and use it in a provocative way when you're making a visit abroad. %$* 143
there are others who believe that there's a more constructive way to go at it. %$* 143
i'm involved in a number of organizations, and i talk to people when i travel abroad, and i spied no difference in the solemn dedication of the united states government to human rights. %$* 143
but i do think that there is a difference in calling for human rights and making a big splash about it as a provocative gesture when you go into a country where you know you're going to have conflict on this and trying to work behind the scenes and more quietly to actually improve the opportunity for human rights. %$* 143
and so that's what this administration's trying to do. %$* 143
ma'am, if you don't read your question, if you are holding a piece of paper, if you are prepared to just blurt it out, i'll take your question and make it brief. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
don't read. %$* 13
hi. %$* 150
my name is ana. %$* 150
i am a senior at the university of vermont. %$* 150
and my questions are directed toward the opposition bench. %$* 150
both of you spoke about how the leaders do what's best for their country and how now public opinion is now more important and even considered the new actor when it comes to foreign policy. %$* 150
why is it, then, when foreign policy is so important to public opinion, and public opinion says that what obama did and his actions towards israel and the israeli government earlier this we're year was inappropriate, he did not listen to public opinion until two bipartisan letters came to him from congress? %$* 150
if public opinion is so imperative to the president and his foreign policy, how come it took congress to back it? %$* 150
in that case, you're talking about u.s.public opinion. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i was not speaking about this public opinion only. %$* 145
yeah, i didn't think so. %$* 13
i was speaking about world public opinion. %$* 145
and i was saying that we are going out, we are leaving a policy of big hugs, of good buddies, sarkozy, bush and so on, and we have good friends, blah, blah, blah. %$* 145
this was the old politics. %$* 145
and george w.bush was very good at that, at hugs with sarkozy, with berlusconi, with aznar in spain and so on. %$* 145
and that today we are facing, we are discovering a real moving actor which is the public opinion, the fighting public opinion in iran, which is the women in afghanistan, which is all the people around the world. %$* 145
and to these, barack obama addresses for the first time a language which goes at the same time to the brain and to the heart. %$* 145
it is-- %$* 145
i travel a lot. %$* 145
it is the first time since many years that i see that the flag of america is again a new, bright flag, meaning hope for a major part of the world, especially in the very deserted parts of the world. %$* 145
and this is a renew-- %$* 145
and it's more important than the buddies, hugs between sarkozy and george w. bush. %$* 145
the gentleman with the brown blazer in the next aisle, white shirt. %$* 13
no, farther up. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
yes, sir. %$* 13
daniel nadelman from new york city. %$* 151
let's assume that barack obama and the united states have every intention with or without israeli's assistance or cooperation, in taking out iran's nuclear capacity. %$* 151
if that's the case, what sort of public foreign policy robust strength would you like to see obama do between now and when that actually happens when they decide that's the right time to happen, for him to demonstrate the type of strength that you're showing, saying that he's not actually demonstrating now? %$* 151
there is a bill before congress right now that would impose sanctions on iran on the import of petroleum products which the iranian economy is dependent on. %$* 142
the house has passed this legislation overwhelming. %$* 142
the senate has passed it overwhelmingly legislatively, and it is in conference right now. %$* 142
the administration is opposed to it. %$* 142
i think that's a grave mistake. %$* 142
another question? %$* 13
because i haven't gone to the dark section near the camera up there. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
you're pointing to yourself again. %$* 13
if everybody points to yourself you can all stand up. %$* 13
can you just step down a little bit into the brighter light so that we can see you and the camera can see you? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you just come out to the aisle. %$* 13
my name is reese schoenfeld and i’m an occasional journalist. %$* 152
and i have an advantage of being a little older than most of you. %$* 152
and i remember 1956 when the voice of america spoke loudly the people hungary and suggested they revolt. %$* 152
and i remembered what happened afterwards very well. %$* 152
i can say with pride that our organization had one of the two americans in there covering it at the time. %$* 152
and i think that what happened at budapest in budapest, in hungary would have been absolutely repeated if we encouraged iranians. %$* 152
can you take this to a question, sir. %$* 13
we encouraged iranian rebels. %$* 152
could you take it to a question, though? %$* 13
yes. %$* 152
do you think it is more likely that the encouragement of iranian rebels would have resulted in blood shed and with no progress or that we should have spoken loudly with no ability to protect them? %$* 152
well, i think that's a fair question. %$* 144
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
i don't know the answer. %$* 144
i don't know if anybody knows the answer. %$* 144
i think one of the rationales for the restraint of the american administration was to have the iranian government be able to divert the attention from those people who were at home objecting to their government and to their policies and blame it all on america. %$* 144
and we didn't want to be the lightning rod, so to speak, for the opposition which they would have brought forth against the people who were dissenting. %$* 144
i don't know-- %$* 144
nobody will ever know what would have worked better. %$* 144
i do think that's a fair argument to make. %$* 144
i don't know the answer to that question. %$* 144
i actually-- %$* 142
can i-- %$* 142
as mort said, it's very difficult to prove as counterfactual, "what would have happened if" but we do know what actually happened, right? %$* 142
the administration chose to be silent, and there was bloodshed in the streets of tehran. %$* 142
and the dissident leaders we hope are the future leaders of iran, were saying where is america? %$* 142
that much we know. %$* 142
and we know the whole world watched that happen, where we looked impotent in the face of a major threat to the iranian regime. %$* 142
we also know that the administration was saying at the time that if we stand back and are silent, this will make it easier for the iranians to come to the negotiating table with us on a-- %$* 142
disarming their nuclear capability. %$* 142
that was an argument, that it'll help them moderate because they won't feel under siege. %$* 142
they won't feel under pressure, and they'll come to the table. %$* 142
well, here we are, almost a year later, exactly, and the iranians, as i said, just mastered 3,000 centrifuges. %$* 142
the iaea is basically conceding that iran is well on its way to having a nuclear weapon. %$* 142
and with that, and we're running out of time. %$* 13
i want to let wes respond. %$* 13
i want to let wes respond to that, and then i want to do more one question. %$* 13
i think you have to be careful in foreign policy not to adopt a feel-good foreign policy. %$* 143
i agree. %$* 142
and one of the persistent elements of what we're getting from our worthy opponents is a feel-good foreign policy. %$* 143
it's like, you know, i'm america. %$* 143
stand up. %$* 143
this is what i believe. %$* 143
that's all well and good, and it goes great in a rotary club where i come from. %$* 143
but when you're actually trying to influence other nations, that kind of logic doesn't work. %$* 143
that's the logic that animated the last administration. %$* 143
it didn't work. %$* 143
we're not going to repeat it. %$* 143
i have time for one more question. %$* 13
yeah, in the white sweater. %$* 13
yes? %$* 13
the microphone is on its way to you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
devon cross. %$* 153
i just would be curious as to both sides, general clark and dan senor, in the business of what america signals its intentions to be, the imposition of the deadline, the withdrawal in afghanistan, how comfortable you would have been fighting under that and likewise the same for you, sir. %$* 153
as i understand the question, how comfortable am i that we're going to start withdrawing in 2011? %$* 143
well-- %$* 143
the question is how-- %$* 153
how comfortable you would have felt with a deadline in prosecuting a war against an enemy that was imposed by political-- %$* 153
well, i wouldn't have been comfortable if we'd put a 2011 deadline on getting out of it. %$* 143
i mean, you can't-- %$* 143
you're dealing with a problem that has to be worked. %$* 143
it's not a mechanical process with a machine. %$* 143
so there are other actors involved, there're other intentions. %$* 143
in my view, most of afghanistan is actually about pakistan, and, therefore, we've got to take the right actions not only in afghanistan but also in pakistan, and the pakistani system, yes, ma'am, because this is osama bin laden in pakistan, the pakistani taliban in pakistan, and we cannot put a large american force in there and do it directly ourselves. %$* 143
it's a nation of 170 million people. %$* 143
it's simply beyond the capacity of the armed forces. %$* 143
so somehow we have to use action at a distance, diplomacy, efforts in pakistan are done by drones and intelligence agencies, and a lot of other effort. %$* 143
so that's not amenable to a hard and fast deadline. %$* 143
i wish it were. %$* 143
but i'm concerned about what's going on in iraq. %$* 143
i hope that what bernard says is right. %$* 143
i know the policy makes sense. %$* 143
but these policies are incredibly difficult to execute. %$* 143
and so when dan says he's worried about it, i'm worried about it, too. %$* 143
but, you know, i think our president has made the right decisions thus far. %$* 143
he's shown strength, he's shown resolve, he's shown proper planning and a deliberate planning process, and we've got to hope our men and women in uniform, and our diplomats, and our congress will do the right thing to help do our part on this mission. %$* 143
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements by each of the debaters in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and that is their last chance to change your minds before you vote for the second time. %$* 13
so to remind you of your vote on our motion when this debate began, the motion being "obama's foreign policy spells america's decline," before the debate began, 23 percent of you agreed with the motion, 45 percent of you disagreed, 32 percent were undecided and here to listen. %$* 13
and we will have you vote again in a few minutes after closing statements. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
but first, round three, closing statements, and speaking first against the motion, wesley clark, retired four star general, former nato supreme allied commander, europe, and senior fellow at ucla's burkle center. %$* 13
well, i guess the first thing i would say is that the position-- %$* 143
the power position of a nation is dependent on not only its military, but its economic strength, and its political processes, its decision-making, and a whole host of factors. %$* 143
and barack obama took over a nation-- %$* 143
i'm not going to label it decline, i'm just going to say it was in a hole. %$* 143
and he's tried to work very systematically to pull us up out of that hole, keeping us safe, dealing with other nations. %$* 143
he hasn't accepted the old prejudices. %$* 143
he did not go to china and say, "i won't talk to you unless you release two human rights activists right now," because the issues between the united states and china are not best dealt with in that kind of a public forum. %$* 143
he went to europe and reassured our allies. %$* 143
he's been very strong in the nato summits. %$* 143
but he's also tried to reach out to medvedev in russia. %$* 143
maybe it won't work, but he's done as much as he can to line up the strategy, he knows what the crucial decisions are that are coming. %$* 143
and every indication shows our president is a man of strong logic, strong convictions, and a man who doesn't hesitate to make tough decisions when they're necessary. %$* 143
he knows those decisions are coming in this administration, and when he makes them, i think you'll see that america is a strong, capable, and respected nation. %$* 143
america-- %$* 143
our foreign policy under barack obama spelling america's decline? %$* 143
i don't think so. %$* 143
i think you're seeing america rebuilding itself, pulling itself up by the bootstraps to move forward into the 21st century. %$* 143
thank you. %$* 143
thank you, mr. %$* 13
clark. %$* 13
our motion is "obama's foreign policy spells america's decline," and now summarizing his position against the motion, dan senor, adjunct senior fellow of the council of foreign relations. %$* 13
his new book on israel's economic miracle, "start-up nation," has just come out and i believe is on sale in the lobby. %$* 13
he's a former pentagon and white house advisor. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dan senor. %$* 13
you know, there was an interesting development about six, eight weeks ago after the administration caused a near rupture in the u.s./israel relationship over an insult that the administration felt it had been subjected to by the israeli government over the settlement issue in east jerusalem. %$* 142
a week later, secretary clinton went to moscow, and the purpose of that trip was to try and get the russians to get on board on the security council for real sanctions against iran. %$* 142
she arrived in moscow and everyone knew that was the purpose of her trip, and upon her arrival, the foreign minister of russia publicly announced that russia was resuming its building of the nuclear plant in bushehr, iran. %$* 142
welcome to moscow, madam secretary. %$* 142
when a senior administration official was quoted in the washington post was asked, do you think that was an insult, he said absolutely not. %$* 142
now anyone who believes that by the way shouldn’t be a senior administration official. %$* 142
but more importantly, it’s a metaphor for this administration’s realignment of its foreign policy, whether it’s in latin america, whether it’s in the arab world, whether it’s in israel, whether it’s in eastern and central europe, we are sending a very consistent message and the leaders in that part of the world are no longer saying it quietly. %$* 142
they are saying it publicly that they feel that america is moving away from its historic commitments to those countries. %$* 142
as you’ve heard tonight, there’s not a single policymaker or government leader, as bernard and general clark said, there’s not a single policymaker or government leader that they can cite that is willing to stand with america today and expend real political capital to stand with america. %$* 142
there is-- %$* 142
there are no real concessions to point to for all this outreach we’ve done, for all the speeches that the president has given. %$* 142
as i’ve said before, personal biography is nice and it is moving to win over crowds around the world. %$* 142
it is not a substitute for a foreign policy, especially when your country is in decline. %$* 142
thank you, dan senor. %$* 13
the motion: “obama’s foreign policy spells america’s decline.” and summarizing his position against the motion, bernard-henri levi, french philosopher and best-selling author. %$* 13
yes, to conclude, i think we are entering into a new world with new rules of the game, with new actors, and that means decline is possible. %$* 145
it is a possibility for america. %$* 145
but i believe that president obama goes against, resists, this possible decline for the following reasons. %$* 145
number one, he says bye-bye to this terrible illusion which was the neoconservative illusion that you could build democracy just like this is a very important move. %$* 145
number two, about human rights. %$* 145
i am a militant of human rights all my life, but i know also when you are the chief of the first superpower in the world, you must be accountable for every single word you express. %$* 145
you cannot go to say to the iranian people, “go revolt, go in front of the tanks.” and then what? %$* 145
are you ready to support? %$* 145
are you ready to wage war or not? %$* 145
obama has the wisdom not to act this way. %$* 145
number three, he acts with a very wise mix of strength and retention of strength: fire and holding the fire. %$* 145
he never said that he was against the military option in, for example, the iranian situation, but he opens the game. %$* 145
and this is what foreign policy is. %$* 145
and at the end, i must say that since a few-- %$* 145
since two years, it is more easy all over the world to be a friend of america. %$* 145
you can be proud today to be a friend of america, which was not the case three, four, five, or eight years ago. %$* 145
i’m sorry to say that. %$* 145
thank you. %$* 145
thank you, bernard-henri lévy. %$* 13
the motion: “obama’s foreign policy spells america’s decline.” and finally summarizing his position in support of this motion, mort zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of u.s. news and world report and publisher of the new york daily news. %$* 13
the reference was made to the economy and to the economic condition of the united states, which i think is a critical part of everything that we’re talking about. %$* 144
we never got a chance in terms of time to do that, but if there is one area where in my judgment we have made huge errors that are going to compound the macroeconomic problems of the united states is in fact the way we have responded to the economic crisis. %$* 144
that in fairness to the extent obama inherited, but in my judgment the policies he adopted were simply inadequate to the problem, they were wrongly focused. %$* 144
there isn't a country in the world that doesn't understand how serious the problems are for the united states and its economy. %$* 144
and if there is one area where we had a huge reach around the world, it was in the area of the economy. %$* 144
and that, i will suggest to you is the area where this administration has failed the most. %$* 144
and by the way, the people who know it most clearly are the american people. %$* 144
and that's why his support has dropped so dramatically. %$* 144
so without going into that in any more detail because there's no time, i think that it contributes mightily to the conclusions that we would urge you to have. %$* 144
thank you, mort zuckerman. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat and to register your vote now. %$* 13
our motion is "obama's foreign policy spells america's decline." if you now agree with this side arguing for this motion, dan senor and mort zuckerman, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion, bernard- henri lévy and wesley clark, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we're going to have the results actually just in a couple of minutes. %$* 13
it takes an instant to get these in. %$* 13
so before that, i just want to chat about a couple of things. %$* 13
first of all, as i said at the beginning of the evening, this is the end of our fourth season. %$* 13
and we gave a round of applause to robert rosenkranz for making all this possible. %$* 13
i also-- %$* 13
somebody else who absolutely needs to be thanked for making these things happen month after month is the executive producer and her rather spare team of support who put this thing together. %$* 13
it's very, very much more difficult than it would look, not just the care and feeding of all of those people on the stage but the hall, the public-- %$* 13
the publicity, all of it. %$* 13
she does everything but upholster the seats that you're sitting on. %$* 13
so dana wolfe, if you'll stand up, it's time to take some credit. %$* 13
and finally, in light of tonight's debate, i just think it was one of the most intelligent and high level that we've had. %$* 13
i want to thank all of our panelists for this. %$* 13
a special thanks goes to our venue, skirball, and our partners, npr, bloomberg television, newsweek and everyone who has supported this fourth series of debates. %$* 13

the air dates and times can be found in your program. %$* 13
and don't forget to read about tonight's debate in next week's copy of newsweek. %$* 13
and you can pick up a current issue on the way out. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
i've just been given the results. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes the most minds is declared the victor. %$* 13
and here it is. %$* 13
our motion, "obama's foreign policy spells america's decline." before the debate, 23 percent of you were for, 45 percent against and 32 percent undecided. %$* 13
at the end, 34 percent are for the motion, 58 percent are against and 8 percent are undecided. %$* 13
the team against the motion carries the night. %$* 13
congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared us. %$* 13

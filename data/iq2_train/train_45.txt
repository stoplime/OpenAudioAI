and one can say, but you cannot impose democracy freedom from outside, of course you can’t impose freedom from outside. %$* 232
but, we find out that you can impose dictatorship from outside, simply by supporting dictators. %$* 232
and that’s unfortunately exactly what so many leaders of the free world were doing. %$* 232
they were supporting and they continued to support, royal saudis. %$* 232
ignoring the fact what’s happening there with the rights of even they supported and continue to support %$* 232
uh, au—au— authoritarian regime of egypt. %$* 232
ignoring the fact that practically every week, there is another human rights activist sent to prison. %$* 232
they were supporting saddam hussein, until the last day. %$* 232
day before saddam hussein sent troops to kuwait, leaders of europe and united states of america believed that he was a good reliable partner, who can get stability. %$* 232
decades before american president started speaking about promoting the freedom of the middle east, al qaeda was born, that was already the place plagued with wars, with killing, and with repression. %$* 232
was middle east safer, before america started talking about promoting democracy. %$* 232
what is— was it safer in the ‘70s, when jordan had to fight plo and syria, when lebanon was almost destroyed with civil war, when iranian re—regime in— emerged, and the american diplomats turned into refugees. %$* 232
was middle east more safe in the ‘80s, when the american airplane was blown up by, uh, libya. %$* 232
when in beirut and hundreds of american soldiers were killed. %$* 232
when one million citizens became victims, killed and wounded, in the war between iran and iraq. %$* 232
has the middle east been more safe in ‘90s, when kuwait was sw—swallowed up, by iraq. %$* 232
when missiles were fired—falling on tel aviv and riyadh. %$* 232
when twin towers survived %$* 232
the first attack of the terrorists. %$* 232
and when al qaeda published its famous fatwa, about killing americans. %$* 232
promoting democracy in the middle east is an excellent idea, by the way i, i idea that it has to be connected with human rights. %$* 232
that the policy of the free world has—in the middle east has to be connected with the question of human rights, that’s exactly what i was promoting for all my years. %$* 232
unfortunately, all the administrations of the united states of america in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and the ‘90s, never did it. %$* 232
promoting democracy in the middle east is an excellent idea, that’s very—the thing is, how. %$* 232
it’s very difficult to overcome the resistance of all those who don’t want democracy there. %$* 232
and that’s a very important question. %$* 232
but it’s not the question which we are discussing today, till this day the question which is discussed is, whether it is good idea or not. %$* 232
the march of freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is very difficult. %$* 232
it will not succeed in one day. %$* 232
but there is no alternative. %$* 232
great struggles between those who on one side, those millions, hundreds of millions in the middle east, who want freedom, and those who want to deprive them of freedom. %$* 232
the problem is that sometimes we forget on whose side we are. %$* 232
the globe was blessed, and i personally was blessed, with america for—which always knew on what side it is. %$* 232
america which knew that, this divide between free world and fear societies, is much more important than divide between republicans and democrats, between this and that party. %$* 232
america which knew that ideal freedom %$* 232
is bigger than any president, any party, any country. %$* 232
thank you. %$* 232
one. %$* 33
and that’s a very important question. %$* 232
but it’s not the question which we are discussing today, till this day the question which is discussed is, whether it is good idea or not. %$* 232
the march of freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is very difficult. %$* 232
it will not succeed in one day. %$* 232
but there is no alternative. %$* 232
great struggles between those who on one side, those millions, hundreds of millions in the middle east, who want freedom, and those who want to deprive them of freedom. %$* 232
the problem is that sometimes we forget on whose side we are. %$* 232
the globe was blessed, and i personally was blessed, with america for—which always knew on what side it is. %$* 232
america which knew that, this divide between free world and fear societies, is much more important than divide between republicans and democrats, between this and that party. %$* 232
america which knew that ideal freedom %$* 232
is bigger than any president, any party, any country. %$* 232
thank you, natan sharansky— %$* 33
thank you. %$* 232
—speaking against the motion. %$* 33
we have heard the opening presentations by all six of our panelists, we now enter our question-and-answer session, folks will come to, uh, get a microphone near members of the audience who want to pose a question, i want to start by, uh, picking up on something that natan sharansky has said and have %$* 33
uh, we’ll have flynt leverett or another member of this panel answer it. %$* 33
uh, can one be an advocate for human rights or should one be an advocate for human rights, without at least implicitly criticizing the entire dictatorial structure of a government that might violate human rights, or ultimately, if we’re going to support anybody whose human rights are violated %$* 33
should we not follow through and say, why not become more democratic while you’re at it. %$* 33
may—may—if i may, um, i’d like to answer this one. %$* 229
um, you know, i—i think there are two big differences here. %$* 229
uh, one difference is, that, when we are saying we’re spreading democracy or we’re shaping institutions a long ways, that we imagine ourselves but there is no consensus or international norms, that’s one thing. %$* 229
but when we are talking about human rights there, uh, there are human rights treaties, there are international laws, there are norms against torture. %$* 229
and many of these governments in the middle east are signatories to these treaties. %$* 229
and therefore, it is a very different order of things, to hold them accountable to those treaties. %$* 229
and it is—and you would get a lot more international support rather than be exposed and be alone in pushing a policy that other people are not doing. %$* 229
and these governments can and must respond, particularly when the international pressure comes. %$* 229
so that’s one difference that is extremely important because we can mobilize supporter, we can strengthen institutions, we can do it, but the other difference is, is that we— there are two %$* 229
uh, the difficulty in imposing democracy, is a, another order beyond— %$* 229
mm-hmm. %$* 33
—uh, trying to uphold people on, on human rights because i want to say this on, on democracy because i think, we don’t have modesty here, it’s like saying, trust us, we can spread democracy. %$* 229
and we don’t have a good record. %$* 229
even scholars don’t know how to do it. %$* 229
and yet we want to make it a priority, when in fact, we haven’t been able to do even lesser things very well. %$* 229
shibley telhami answered that question. %$* 33
uh, are you satisfied with that, natan sharansky, that you can separate human rights out from a—a broader— %$* 33
no, i—i think— %$* 232
—political critique— %$* 33
i think that’s exactly the ways of more, more, more than relatives that there is constant attempt to separate the question of human rights from the nature of societies. %$* 232
that, like some %$* 232
organization of human rights say we are not make different mark— giving marks to regimes, we don’t say what regime is good and bad. %$* 232
and as a result, we can have one page about violations of human rights in syria, and 100 pages of violations of human rights, about in america, and everyone says, well you see america is much worse. %$* 232
and i always say you know, have the same information, it’s very important to me that american will all be criticized for human rights. %$* 232
but rights authoritarian regimes, or totalitarian regimes and democratic regimes. %$* 232
and to be clear that, 100 pages about democratic regime is not the same as one line about authoritarian regime. %$* 232
unfortunately, the of human rights was absolutely separated from the nature of the regimes themselves. %$* 232
well, at—at this moment, uh, perhaps we’ll have some follow-up on this point, but i—i want to, uh, report to you how you voted before you heard from our debaters. %$* 33
on the motion, uh, that spreading democracy in the middle east is a bad idea, 46%, uh, of you in the audience using your keypads voted for the motion. %$* 33
36% voted against the motion, and 18% were undecided. %$* 33
so those were the pre-debate results, and we’ll vote again, a little bit later. %$* 33
just on this—this point of human rights, uh, flynt leverett, did you, did you have something to add to—to your side? %$* 33
yeah—yeah, i just wanted to say, yes, it is possible to make that separation and it actually works in the real world. %$* 227
um, one of the few things i did in my, um, service at the bush white house of which i am unreservedly proud, is that i drafted the letter that president bush sent to president mubarek in 2002 regarding the detention of saad eddin ibrahim, the, the scholar— %$* 227
democracy advocate in— %$* 33
—yes— %$* 227
—in egypt. %$* 33
um, and basically the tack we took in that letter was, um, we were at that point discussing the possibility of, um, uh, additional aid to israe—to egypt beyond what egypt was already receiving. %$* 227
and we simply said in the letter, you know, you’re doing this to saad has made it impossible for us to move ahead with any kind of initiative like this. %$* 227
we also said in the letter, you know, existing aid and our strategic cooperation, you know, we hope will go on. %$* 227
um, but we sent the— %$* 227
—but we sent the signal that you can’t get— %$* 227
that’s promoting democracy— %$* 232
—you can’t get more— %$* 227
exactly—exactly— %$* 230
and— %$* 227
that’s promoting democracy— %$* 232
—we can’t get more— %$* 227
sure. %$* 230
and— %$* 227
sure. %$* 230
in the end, saad was released in pretty short order after that letter was sent because— %$* 227
but the offense that you were addressing, flynt, was, he’s in jail, you weren’t saying, we want to adopt his reform agenda for democracy— %$* 33
no, we were saying we want him out of jail. %$* 227
hmm. %$* 33
it’s a start— %$* 33
can i respond on that, because i think that’s a— %$* 230
liz cheney. %$* 33
—that’s a—what, what flynt has described is accurate, uh, and it is a key—a terrific example of how the us promotes democracy, it is one of the tools to use. %$* 230
um, saad eddin was in jail because he’d been a threat to the regime, because he’d supposedly written an article about the succession in egypt, he’d written things the regime did not appreciate. %$* 230
he was imprisoned, he was a prisoner of conscience. %$* 230
and at some point, from, from the perspective of us policy, it became unacceptable to us, and we, we said to the mubarek regime we will no longer continue this level of aid, we will consider future levels of aid at risk— %$* 230
though we will continue at a present level— %$* 227
uh, if you—if you— right, we will consider future levels of aid at risk if you go down this path, and potentially, in following years, additional amounts would be at risk. %$* 230
at the same it— %$* 230
flynt, i was also there but let me finish, i gave you a chance. %$* 230
at the same time, we said to the government of egypt, we’re gonna take part of the assistance that we are already giving you, and we are gonna set it aside from democracy promotion activities. %$* 230
and we are going to fund activities that you may or may not agree with us on, we are not gonna ask your approval every time we provide assistance to a women’s rights organization, or to a political organization. %$* 230
uh, we are gonna be promoting democracy, we would rather do this hand in hand, we would rather find ways that we can work together, but it’s us taxpayers’ money and we wanna see it spent in the cause of freedom. %$* 230
so i think it’s important to, to note that this is just one example of the kinds of tools we use, um, to effectively help to support the spread of freedom. %$* 230
danielle pletka? %$* 33
i think it’s also important and it’s a little bit unfair perhaps but it is important to bear a little bit of witness to what saad eddin ibrahim has done since he was released, uh, from prison, uh, with the good offices of flynt, liz, and, and other folks in the bush administration, and that is that he has been an untiring and, extraordinarily annoying to the mubarek regime, voice for change— %$* 228
reform— %$* 33
—for reform, and he said to the president of the united states in the presence of natan and others at a recent conference in prague, why do you not do more. %$* 228
why do you not stand up for us. %$* 228
now, that’s not the three of us or the three of you. %$* 228
that is a reformer in the middle east who’s calling upon us to use our power. %$* 228
and i think that that is what we need to reflect, those voices— %$* 228
dimitri simes. %$* 33
you know— when i hear this argument, that we should criticize every government, uh, we disagreement with in terms of their domestic practices, i want to ask people in the audience before the vote, to ask themselves %$* 231
when was the last time you assaulted, even if for rhetorically, your business partners. %$* 231
when if you are a lawyer, when was the last time you told a judge that he was a jerk. %$* 231
uh, when you came to school where your children study, and there told the principal that you have no confidence in them. %$* 231
you know what %$* 231
if you have to work with people, not because you appointed them, not because you selected them, but because you need to work with them, you have to know when to stop. %$* 231
you don’t need to praise them artificially. %$* 231
you do not need to pretend like president bush did, that, uh, president putin had a wonderful pro-democracy soul. %$* 231
but, you do understand that if you need egypt, if you need the saudis, to help you with the middle east peace process, to create an impression that we are trying to overthrow their governments, well, you know, it’s a little inconsistent. %$* 231
it is counterproductive. %$* 231
and i think like with every good thing, we need to know when to stop. %$* 231
and the bush administration did not know, and still does not know when to stop. %$* 231
i need to say one thing in response to that though, and i know natan wants to answer too. %$* 230
9-11 changed that. %$* 230
and after september 11th, we were very clearly in a situation where it wasn’t us talking to our children’s teacher. %$* 230
it was us saying to governments in the region, conditions inside your countries have become a national security challenge, threat, concern for us. %$* 230
it’s not us saying that we are going to %$* 230
impose democracy, saying that we’re going to invade every country in the middle east as are some of the straw men that are, that are held up, but much more us saying, look, we are threatened by the conditions in your country. %$* 230
we are threatened as a nation because your children are living in despair, because your children have no hope, because they can’t speak, because they go to schools where they’re teaching hatred, and violence and intolerance. %$* 230
those things are not sort of your concerns which have no impact on us, and anybody who lived through 9-11 has thought about the fact that that danger came here to our shores, primarily from countries in that region which are not allowing freedom for their people. %$* 230
you have to understand that their freedom is not just right but it’s a national security interest for the united states— %$* 230
shib—shibley telhami has the last word of this exchange— %$* 33
what liz has just said is actually rather revealing, because i think that’s an argument about, uh, not democracy as an end in itself but as an instrument to en—to american security, it’s a— it’s a— %$* 229
it’s both. %$* 230
it’s absolutely both— %$* 230
well—you, you know, you can’t have it both ways, and i think if this is the tack that was taken, uh, this is part of the problem, you have to make an evaluation, has it served our security, even if you don’t make a judgment about democracy, uh, in the same way that we did have a— i think many people in the american political mainstream came to believe that, somehow terrorism is a function of the absence of democracy. %$* 229
first of all, scho—scholars don’t agree on that necessary. %$* 229
but, but, let’s assume that that was the case. %$* 229
then you have to make an assessment whether we have more terrorism or less terrorism, as a consequence of the policy that we have undertaken, and i think, everybody could look now and make an assessment on where we are in the middle east, there’s more— there’s no doubt, that there is more al qaeda in the middle east than there was before, in our world certainly, and, there is more terrorism in the middle east than before. %$* 229
so it hasn’t worked with our national security, and it is being in a way, argued both as an end in itself and an instrument of security, when in fact, even the scholars who believe it’s possible to do it, believe it’ll take years to do and then meanwhile, all you have is instability. %$* 229
and what instability is correlated with, is more terrorism. %$* 229
and that is why we can’t have it both ways, so when hamas gets elected, uh, you’re stuck. %$* 229
you don’t know what to do. %$* 229
that’s the problem. %$* 229
natan sharansky’s gonna make a liar of me and insist on— %$* 33
yeah, i—i want only— %$* 232
—having the last word— %$* 33
no, i want only to, to react to the jokes of mr. %$* 232
simes because they sounded for me like kind of déjà vu. %$* 232
and i understood why. %$* 232
because they are exactly those arguments of those who explained to us why soviet union should not be called evil empire. %$* 232
why soviet union should not be restricted in it trade with the united states. %$* 232
why should not be massive demonstrations for soviet jews when soviet officials are coming. %$* 232
if these jokes were heard then and there you were very strong. %$* 232
if they would listen to them, i would still be in prison. %$* 232
well, you know— %$* 231
is there—no, is there a question for— %$* 33
when i came to the united states, one of the first things, uh, i did, was, uh, to become a secretary of the advisory board of the union of councils for soviet jews. %$* 231
and i was a strong supporter of the jackson-vanik amendment. %$* 231
so— %$* 232
there is absolutely no contradiction, between, uh %$* 231
helping people like mr. %$* 231
sharansky, who is a genuine hero, and whose courage i greatly admire, and also understanding some practical interests. %$* 231
ronald reagan called the soviet union an evil empire. %$* 231
ronald reagan also, immediately after his assassination, uh, wrote a handwritten letter to leonid brezhnev, suggesting that they should find a way to work together. %$* 231
you need to find the balance. %$* 231
the bush administration doesn’t know how to do it. %$* 231
now, we have a question— we have a question from the audience on the, on the aisle, sir. %$* 33
and, may i say that, uh %$* 33
please, ask your questions after someone has arrived with a microphone, if you are a member of the press, uh, please identify yourself. %$* 33
uh, if you’re not a member of the press you—you have privacy rights. %$* 33
what if you wanna be a member of the press. %$* 233
if you’re an aspiring member of the press you may also identify yourself— %$* 33
my name is arthur schiff, my question is, uh, this, what is the moral responsibility of the united states, to that fraction of the population in oppressed countries, and specifically for example the people we left behind in vietnam and the people we left behind in iraq in ’91— what is the moral responsibility of the us to those people who advocate, care about, are willing to sacrifice themselves, endanger their lives, because they are committed to democracy, and irrespective of everything else see the us as that bastion of democratic hope. %$* 233
let me ask liz cheney, if people sign up in one of these countries for the campaign for democracy at america’s urging, and then they find themselves on the outs, uh, by a, uh, a new strong man, what’s our obligation to those people— %$* 33
well i think it’s an excellent question, i think that, um, the record of the united states in 1991 in iraq after calling on the shia in particular to rise up and then not being there to support them, um, is a shame. %$* 230
and i think it’s something very much our enemies look to. %$* 230
i think it’s also, uh, something that our allies look to. %$* 230
i think that, those who argue for example that we should leave iraq today, those who argue that we should pull out of the middle east today, um, i have not heard them explain what that would mean for the millions of people who have believed us when we’ve said that we are standing for freedom, we’re stranding for a new middle east. %$* 230
and in fact %$* 230
i think that, that, in response to one of the points shibley was making, we have a convergence, it’s a—it’s, often, uh, unusual, maybe too unusual. %$* 230
but we have a convergence today, between what is the right thing to do morally. %$* 230
what is the right thing to do to live up to america’s heritage, and america’s proper role in the world, which is to promote freedom where we can. %$* 230
a convergence between that and america’s national security interest, which is that today, promoting freedom in the middle east will make us safer and has made us safer, and i disagree with shibley, you don’t have to choose. %$* 230
when you have a situation where there’s a convergence between those two objectives, um, it seems to me that it’s pretty clear that the path you go do down is to undertake that policy. %$* 230
on the issue of whether it’s made us safer i would only point out that during the 1990s when the united states was in fact undertaking the policy that they have advocated, we were attacked in 1993, 1998, 2000.since 2001, we have not been attacked again. %$* 230
now, you can talk about what’s happening in the region, we can argue about that, we can argue about the war in iraq, as i said i welcome that, i welcome the opportunity to do that. %$* 230
but you cannot ignore the fact that since we have been promoting democracy in the middle east, since we have been standing on the side of those for freedom, as messy, as complicated, as difficult as it is, al qaeda has not attacked us here in the us again. %$* 230
it’s not only because of that policy, absolutely, it’s because of %$* 230
uh, our own policies to take the fight to the enemy, it’s because of what we’ve done to protect the homeland. %$* 230
but surely that policy has been part of it, and you cannot ignore that absence of attacks if you make the argument that we’re not safer. %$* 230
i think flynt leverett has something to say about that. %$* 33
yeah. %$* 227
america’s moral obligation to the kinds of people that you were describing, is first of all, not to lead such people to believe that we will support them in ways that in the end, we will not provide. %$* 227
our first moral obligation is not to mislead people. %$* 227
our second moral obligation, particularly in relation to iraq, is not to go to war, when we do not have a coherent and plausible plan for stabilizing a country like that, after we have overthrown the regime. %$* 227
to do that, i would argue, is the height of moral irresponsibility. %$* 227
we have a— a question from the audience. %$* 33
audience member (male) uh, i have a question for, uh, the side, uh, arguing for the proposition. %$* 33
and granted of course that the united states sometimes does have to make compromises, uh, with dictatorial regimes and sometimes in fact has to wind up being allied with dictatorial regimes, most famously of course in the case of world war ii.but what i’m wondering is, are there any regimes so reprehensible in the world today or in recent history, that the side arguing for the proposition would say that we cannot be allied with them. %$* 33
would you for example say that we should have been allied with the khmer rouge as they were running cambodia and killing 2 million of their citizens. %$* 33
is there some point at which we actually should draw the line in terms of regimes that we simply cannot stomach. %$* 33
and if so what is that line and how do you differ, and differentiate between that, and some of the regimes that we in fact have supported for years in the middle east. %$* 33
well, i— %$* 231
is there a red line. %$* 33
i most definitely would not be allied with khmer rouge. %$* 231
i most definitely would not be allied with ahmadinejad, and i most definitely think it was a mistake for us in the past to be seen allied with saddam hussein. %$* 231
but i would have to make one qualifier. %$* 231
that is unless of course, we are facing an apocalyptic threat. %$* 231
that is why winston churchill decided to be allied with stalin. %$* 231
and if you would look at churchill’s record, vis-à-vis communism, he probably was most brutal in, uh, being quite honest about what a horrible regime they had in the soviet union at that time. %$* 231
but in comparison with hitler, and i’m not even sure quite that churchill was making just a moral judgment, he was making a strategic judgment, he felt that britain had no choice, and let me say this. %$* 231
i wish our foreign policy was a morality play. %$* 231
i wish there was never tension between what we wish, and what we know is security interests. %$* 231
but there is tension. %$* 231
and when we are talking about this tension, we are not suggesting that we do not care about the abuse, about those who have no voice. %$* 231
but we are talking about realistic foreign policy choices. %$* 231
and friends, if you believe in democracy, democracy starts with the serious and informed conversation in home. %$* 231
shibley telhami, you had something to add to that? %$* 33
uh, well i—i agree first of all that there are people you don’t deal with, but you know, the choice isn’t between having an ally and, and, and not, i mean, in, in, in most cases there, there are %$* 229
uh, governments that are bad that you don’t deal with or you can ignore. %$* 229
there’s a difference between, uh, uh, applying sanctions or applying some international, uh, punishment on a—on a regime, and between going to change the system. %$* 229
uh, i think that, uh, we’re in a great position, uh, and we were after 9-11, to mobilize the international community over issues that were of great importance not just to us but to everyone else. %$* 229
and human rights is included in that. %$* 229
and, we have international forums, uh, for a, in which we can take this, we still are the most powerful nation, and peop—we could’ve led in international organizations, uh, to tighten, to, to punish, to, uh, to, uh, exclude people who were violating human rights in the international system, i believe that we need to do that. %$* 229
i think it is important to have moral values. %$* 229
i think that, national interest cannot explain all of what we do, i don’t wanna just be serving my material interests, i’m a—i’m a moral individual, i want my country to stand for moral issues, i don’t deny that. %$* 229
i think we can—are capable of it, if we’re not capable of it as a—as the united states of america, no country is. %$* 229
we’re far too powerful, not to have something extra to push for the good in the world beyond. %$* 229
what i’m calling for, is more modesty, more selectivity, more %$* 229
international, uh, organization, uh, type action. %$* 229
uh, not the sort of, uh, i don’t wanna say—arrogance probably is the word, in this particular case, to say that we know what is best and we’re going to bring it about, that’s not values. %$* 229
especially, when the morning after, people are far worse as they are in iraq, than many of them were the day before. %$* 229
that is not values, that is not spreading good in the world, that is not, when you have more than 2 million refugees, most of whom we’re not even trying to provide for. %$* 229
danielle pletka has a, has a response to what you’ve said, shibley— %$* 33
i don’t, i don’t, i don’t have a, uh, a ques—a response, i have a question, um, i would like to ask our compatriots whether, uh, had they had the opportunity, um, and were in a position to do so prior to 9-11, would they have worked to overthrow or change the regime in afghanistan and remove the taliban. %$* 228
i’m glad you asked. %$* 231
oh, good. %$* 228
go for it, dimitri. %$* 228
i was, uh %$* 231
uh, bus-riding. %$* 231
and talking to people in the administration, including, uh, to the secretary of state %$* 231
about, uh, the need to establish american priorities. %$* 231
and after world trade center, after what was done to american, embassies in africa, i felt very strongly, that the big target had to be, taliban, and of course al qaeda. %$* 231
however, the administration at that time was so upset with what was happening in russia, and so eager to reduce increasing russia down to size, that they ignored, then prime minister putin, he was not president yet, prime minister putin, suggestions, that the united states and russia would work together against taliban. %$* 231
similar felt, that we, instead of focusing on all kinds of things including democracy promotion in pakistan, had to make that that very issue, pakistani support for taliban, the central issue in our dialogue with that government. %$* 231
but we treated foreign policy as a christmas tree. %$* 231
we did not want to establish priorities. %$* 231
we wanted to do everything at the time. %$* 231
we cannot conduct an experiment in history, i do not know whether to attack taliban with the russians, and with the pakistanis, whether we would be able to prevent september 11th. %$* 231
but you would’ve supported that— %$* 228
we would never know. %$* 231
but you would’ve supported it, right? %$* 228
i most definitely— %$* 231
like you supported the overthrow of saddam hussein. %$* 228
i—as a matter of fact— %$* 231
right. %$* 228
i did sup— %$* 231
i—you did, i know that you did— %$* 228
the amount of— %$* 231
i’m just checking. %$* 228
i did support the overthrow of saddam hussein— %$* 231
right, good. %$* 228
you’re absolutely right. %$* 231
i’m thrilled to hear it. %$* 228
as— %$* 33
and i have no regret— %$* 231
as did i. %$* 228
as—as a point of advancing democracy, uh, in iraq? %$* 33
uh, that’s, that’s— %$* 231
not so fast— %$* 232
that is the big issue. %$* 231
okay— %$* 33
i thought that saddam— %$* 231
not no— %$* 232
—hussein was a threat, i thought that containment was not working, i thought we had to go and try to do it quickly— %$* 231
—and to turn the project to international organizations. %$* 231
natan sharansky. %$* 33
one short note is simply in support of winston churchill, because it was mentioned correctly that winston churchill had no choice but to cooperate with stalin to fight hitler. %$* 232
but immediately after the war, he was the first to declare the beginning of cold war. %$* 232
he was the first to recognize who—what is the nature of soviet union. %$* 232
and he brought back that moral clarity, which is lacking so much today, thank you. %$* 232
well, thank you very much for your answers to my questions and the questions we’ve taken from the audience, and we’ve managed to debate not only the spread of democracy in the middle east today but the, uh %$* 33
uh, alliance between the united states, britain and soviet union during the second world war— and i’m sure we could go still further, and, uh, and you’ll yet have another chance to raise these points now in closing, uh, statements which are to run maximum two minutes. %$* 33
uh, and we begin with, uh, natan sharansky. %$* 33
against the resolution. %$* 33
well, uh, it was mentioned already today that some time ago, i together with vaclav havel organized an international conference in prague on security and democracy. %$* 232
and it became like a kind of international meeting of democratic dissidents from all over the world but first of all from middle east. %$* 232
for there were so many democratic dissidents from iran and iraq and libya and syria, and sudan and egypt and so on. %$* 232
i know by listening to the stories of these people, i think they themselves, were surprised to discover how each of them has the same story. %$* 232
of personal struggle, a person who wants to be free and wants his country to be free, against totalitarian regime. %$* 232
and, uh, it was easy to recognize the stories of our dissident stories, mine and vaclav havel’s then, and theirs today. %$* 232
with one difference. %$* 232
we knew %$* 232
that if we go to prison all the free world will be with us. %$* 232
they know that they, when they go to prison, the free world is debating whether it is in our interest to support them, or their %$* 232
uh, or the people who jailed them. %$* 232
one. %$* 33
and that’s a big problem. %$* 232
frankly speaking, i’d like on today’s debate, abraham lincoln who’s been speaking together with us. %$* 232
because, this president when he came to the office %$* 232
black americans were slaves, and even had to rights to walk. %$* 232
if he was asked if it is good idea to promote democracy, is it %$* 232
good idea to impose democracy, is stability should be preferred to democracy, what he would answer. %$* 232
he once said—i don’t remember exact quote, i don’t something like this—we will not be the masters, we will not be the slaves. %$* 232
we of course, we are, thank god, we are not slaves. %$* 232
we must make sure that we are not supporting the masters. %$* 232
to promote democracy, it’s first of all to stop supporting tyr—tyrants in the middle east. %$* 232
well, uh, it was mentioned already today that some time ago, i together with vaclav havel organized an international conference in prague on security and democracy. %$* 232
and it became like a kind of international meeting of democratic dissidents from all over the world but first of all from middle east. %$* 232
for there were so many democratic dissidents from iran and iraq and libya and syria, and sudan and egypt and so on. %$* 232
i know by listening to the stories of these people, i think they themselves, were surprised to discover how each of them has the same story. %$* 232
of personal struggle, a person who wants to be free and wants his country to be free, against totalitarian regime. %$* 232
and, uh, it was easy to recognize the stories of our dissident stories, mine and vaclav havel’s then, and theirs today. %$* 232
with one difference. %$* 232
we knew %$* 232
that if we go to prison all the free world will be with us. %$* 232
they know that they, when they go to prison, the free world is debating whether it is in our interest to support them, or their %$* 232
uh, or the people who jailed them. %$* 232
thank you, uh, natan sharansky, now %$* 33
now for the resolution, flynt leverett. %$* 33
i think that %$* 227
in making your vote this evening, you have, in many ways, a quite simple choice. %$* 227
if you believe that the alternative to the house of saud, the alternative to the mubarek regime, is a group of western-educated jeffersonian democrats, then you ought to vote against the resolution. %$* 227
if you believe as i do, that under current circumstances the alternatives to these incumbent regimes will actually be worse for american interests, and, i think, worse for the people in these countries, then you should vote for the resolution. %$* 227
it is a red herring to say that by saying democracy promotion in the middle east is a bad idea, we basically are washing our hands of any concern about how the middle east develops. %$* 227
one— %$* 33
that is simply not true. %$* 227
there is an enormous ferment in the persian gulf today, around economic reform, around, as liz pointed out, the spread of information technologies, the increasing involvement of the gulf states, and other middle eastern countries in the globalized world of the 21st century. %$* 227
that is not a product of american policy, in fact i would say we’re not doing enough to support those developments. %$* 227
egypt can get a free-trade agreement with the european union but it can’t get a free-trade agreement with us. %$* 227
that’s nuts, we ought to be supporting economic reform in these countries, we ought to be standing up for human rights, and the political development in these countries will then, over time, take care of itself, and in the meantime, we will be much better positioned to fight terror, protect the security of the state of israel, and protect our most vital interests in the gulf— %$* 227
i think that %$* 227
in making your vote this evening, you have, in many ways, a quite simple choice. %$* 227
if you believe that the alternative to the house of saud, the alternative to the mubarek regime, is a group of western-educated jeffersonian democrats, then you ought to vote against the resolution. %$* 227
if you believe as i do, that under current circumstances the alternatives to these incumbent regimes will actually be worse for american interests, and, i think, worse for the people in these countries, then you should vote for the resolution. %$* 227
it is a red herring to say that by saying democracy promotion in the middle east is a bad idea, we basically are washing our hands of any concern about how the middle east develops. %$* 227
thank you, flynt leverett. %$* 33
speaking for the resolution. %$* 33
liz cheney, against. %$* 33
um, i think it’s important as you vote tonight to think about the fact that all three of those arguing for the motion, have argued our point. %$* 230
flynt’s just argued that we ought to be supporting the changes that we’re seeing in the gulf, not just the economic changes but the expansion of information technology, the expansion of freedom of the press, that’s part of democracy. %$* 230
dimitri argued that we ought to be supporting freedom of choice. %$* 230
that’s what we’re doing. %$* 230
um, and shibley said we should advocate democracy, we just ought to do it differently. %$* 230
so i think that it’s important for us to focus on what is the debate here tonight, but when we’ve got all three of our opponents arguing that, that the policy itself may have flaws but that in one way or another we ought to be advocating democracy, human rights, freedom, economic reform, uh, it is, uh %$* 230
hard not to imagine that, that what is, um, urging them to argue for this motion, is a disagreement about our iraq policy, a disagreement about george bush, a disagreement about our foreign policy in general. %$* 230
one. %$* 33
and i think it’s critically important to recognize this isn’t a game. %$* 230
there are real people, real men and women, as i mentioned across the region today, tonight, tomorrow, who believe america will stand with them for freedom. %$* 230
and i think that, that the, uh, great moral disservice that we would do, we could do to them, the greatest moral disservice we could do to them would be to fold our tent in the face of terrorist attack, to fold our tent in the face of extremists, who don’t believe that women should be equal, who don’t believe in freedom of religion, who don’t believe in freedom of speech. %$* 230
our opponents have also said we need a balanced policy, we need to work with regimes when they can help us in the war on terror, and at the same time we need to be supporting freedom. %$* 230
that’s what we do. %$* 230
you can say we don’t do it the way you would do it, we could have a debate about how to do it more effectively, but at the end of the day, that is what we’re doing, that is what the policy is, and i think it’s critically important that we don’t abandon those who are standing with us, to help build a world in which we don’t have to fear attack by terrorists. %$* 230
um, i think it’s important as you vote tonight to think about the fact that all three of those arguing for the motion, have argued our point. %$* 230
flynt’s just argued that we ought to be supporting the changes that we’re seeing in the gulf, not just the economic changes but the expansion of information technology, the expansion of freedom of the press, that’s part of democracy. %$* 230
dimitri argued that we ought to be supporting freedom of choice. %$* 230
that’s what we’re doing. %$* 230
um, and shibley said we should advocate democracy, we just ought to do it differently. %$* 230
so i think that it’s important for us to focus on what is the debate here tonight, but when we’ve got all three of our opponents arguing that, that the policy itself may have flaws but that in one way or another we ought to be advocating democracy, human rights, freedom, economic reform, uh, it is, uh %$* 230
hard not to imagine that, that what is, um, urging them to argue for this motion, is a disagreement about our iraq policy, a disagreement about george bush, a disagreement about our foreign policy in general. %$* 230
thank you, liz cheney. %$* 33
uh, closing statement, shibley telhami for the resolution. %$* 33
we need more democratic change, more liberty, more human rights, not words to claim we are doing it, and not promises that we can in fact do it. %$* 229
the train wreck is too long to miss. %$* 229
it is easy to sell dreams in times of pain, and many after the horror of 9-11 so badly wanted answers. %$* 229
and visions of spreading democracy were too good to resist. %$* 229
if something is imaginable, we thought, it is possible. %$* 229
if something is possible, we thought, it is likely. %$* 229
thus is the stuff of wishful thinking. %$* 229
it would still be worth a dream if the costs and reality were not so unbearably high, if it weren’t for the fact that the morning after, has been even worse than the day before. %$* 229
that millions are paying the price. %$* 229
there’s a time to go with your heart— %$* 229
one. %$* 33
—and there is a time to go with your mind. %$* 229
and this is the time to go with your mind. %$* 229
thank you. %$* 229
thank you %$* 33
shibley telhami. %$* 33
danielle pletka, against the motion. %$* 33
flynt suggested in his closing remarks that, uh, that if the united states harps on the treaty obligations of, uh, of our, our arab dictator, uh, friends, then perhaps there will be a greater adherence to human rights. %$* 228
um, i recall the iranian signature of the international atomic energy agency’s nuclear non- proliferation treaty, um, which was not a very effective treaty that was signed, uh, north korea, same. %$* 228
uh, all the counter-terrorism treaties, the genocide treaties, the chemical weapons conventions. %$* 228
pieces of paper make bureaucrats in washington feel good. %$* 228
they enable them to come home with victories that they can trumpet on the front page of the washington post and the new york times. %$* 228
but it doesn’t do a great deal for the people who live in these countries, the 300 million people of the middle east and north africa who don’t live in freedom. %$* 228
as i came here today and looked out the window and you can see signs hanging from institutions, synagogues in particular that say— %$* 228
one. %$* 33
—“save darfur.” why is it that we have a special regard for darfur, but not for the 300 million of the middle east and north africa who have lived so long with torture, without freedom, and yes, with genocide as well. %$* 228
our past failings should not dictate our future failings. %$* 228
and our hearts and our minds should work together, for the right thing in the national interest. %$* 228
yes, it’s true, hitler was elected by democracy. %$* 228
but that does not discredit democracy. %$* 228
to the contrary, those who are willing to accept that decision, and do nothing in the face of the reality that hitler was an evil, ruthless tyrant, were the chamberlains. %$* 228
and those who spoke out to depose and to act and to spread democracy and change in national interest, were with churchill. %$* 228
and i think history will judge those who stood on the other side very harshly in this regard as well. %$* 228
flynt suggested in his closing remarks that, uh, that if the united states harps on the treaty obligations of, uh, of our, our arab dictator, uh, friends, then perhaps there will be a greater adherence to human rights. %$* 228
um, i recall the iranian signature of the international atomic energy agency’s nuclear non- proliferation treaty, um, which was not a very effective treaty that was signed, uh, north korea, same. %$* 228

but it doesn’t do a great deal for the people who live in these countries, the 300 million people of the middle east and north africa who don’t live in freedom. %$* 228
as i came here today and looked out the window and you can see signs hanging from institutions, synagogues in particular that say— %$* 228
danielle pletka. %$* 33
and in conclusion dimitri simes for the motion. %$* 33
like mr. %$* 231
sharansky, i also lived in the soviet union. %$* 231
and, uh, for most of us, the united states was a shining castle. %$* 231
and the united states stood, not only for prosperity and freedom for the united states, but also for freedom for the rest of us. %$* 231
the big difference however, for—between standing for this kind of freedom, and what we have witnessed during last several years, that every american president, before this one, was taking the position that we would protect and defend freedom of americans, and of the allies. %$* 231
and whenever possible, would protect freedom of other nations. %$* 231
the country was not taking upon themselves, telling others on a global scale how they’re supposed to live. %$* 231
and when you go to the world, and offer indispensable guidance, particularly when you are not particular popular, when you— %$* 231
one— %$* 33
—are not particularly liked, you know what? %$* 231
it creates a backlash. %$* 231
the debate tonight is not about freedom. %$* 231
the debate tonight is whether we want to have a foreign policy which makes us feel good, or do we have to have foreign policy judged by results. %$* 231
and i am convinced, the dissidents in iran, democrats in iraq, they want results, not rhetoric. %$* 231
that is why i am in favor of this resolution. %$* 231
thank you, dimitri simes. %$* 33
and so we’ve heard the concluding remarks, it’s now time to vote. %$* 33

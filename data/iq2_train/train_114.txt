a centrist, according to your-- %$* 346
no, no, centrist according to your definition, because he is moving with the times. %$* 346
you were saying, "centrist," in quotation marks. %$* 13
i don't think he's centrist at all, my gosh. %$* 346
i mean-- %$* 346
okay. %$* 13
let's go to another question. %$* 13
he's left the stage he's so left. %$* 346
i mean, come on. %$* 346
i'm sorry, folks, upstairs, if you're raising your hands, i can't see you, and we don't have mics up there, and that's why i'm only calling downstairs. %$* 13
ma'am, over on the far side. %$* 13
you've now seen some very good questions, so let's keep that going. %$* 13
no pressure. %$* 13
my name is alison proleski i wanted to ask-- %$* 350
nobody has really brought up the issue of the gop's position on climate change. %$* 350
and i wanted to see both sides address where maybe that might play a role in the debate. %$* 350
all right. %$* 13
let me just start with mickey edwards first on that. %$* 13
i don't know what you mean. %$* 345
climate change. %$* 13
oh, climate change. %$* 345
i couldn't hear what you said. %$* 345
climate change? %$* 345
she wants to know the party's position on climate change and where that fits into your argument about the party-- %$* 13
one of the things that was always very interesting was that during the bush and cheney years, when you were talking about the chance that a terrorist threat might be 1 percent real, that you had to take an action because you couldn't afford the chance it was real. %$* 345
believe me, the environmental threat today is more than 1 percent possible. %$* 345
and i think it's an obligation of the republican party, of conservatives, to recognize that if you're going to fight against things that might do harm, might do danger, you know, that one of the things you have to look at is what's happening in the environment and what you need to do to secure our safety in that regard, too. %$* 345
and where do you think the party stands on-- %$* 13
its record is on that? %$* 13
well, i don't-- %$* 345
i mean, should i quote senator inhofe that-- %$* 345
i don't want to say deniers, but they're deniers. %$* 345
all right. %$* 13
let me take it to the other side. %$* 13
do you want to tangle on the issue of climate change? %$* 13
ralph reed. %$* 13
look, the republican party takes the position that the science on climate change is not sufficiently settled. %$* 347
let me-- %$* 347
let me-- %$* 347
that's an easy way to get a "boo" in this audience, ralph. %$* 346
let me finish the sentence. %$* 347
i'm dissociating myself-- %$* 346
it’s not sufficiently-- %$* 347
i'm very hot. %$* 346
settled to justify a federally run cap in tax, cap and trade system which has been an unmitigated disaster in the eurozone. %$* 347
you should know that the eurozone has adopted what this administration has proposed; a cap and trade system where you have permits that trade carbon emissions back and forth across industries and factories and even across country lines. %$* 347
what are their co2, emissions up roughly over the last two years? %$* 347
4 percent. %$* 347
we don't have a cap and trade system. %$* 347
our carbon emissions have fallen by about 1 percent per year without it. %$* 347
you know why? %$* 347
because we've incentivized corporations to adopt cleaner technology without going to that system. %$* 347
so we clearly oppose a cap in tax system which one study would show, through higher utility bills, higher gasoline, and higher built-in energy prices for everything from keeping your home warm to running a factory or a manufacturing establishment, will be a $1,800 tax on every family of four in america. %$* 347
i want to go-- %$* 13
we're not for that. %$* 347
i want to go to one more question here. %$* 13
and by the way, neither are a lot of democrats. %$* 347
here is my rule on the next question. %$* 13
you need to be able to state it in ten seconds, and we're up against the time limit here. %$* 13
i'm going to give each side 30 seconds to respond to it. %$* 13
uh-oh. %$* 346
i'm going to stop them at 30 seconds. %$* 13
does anybody have a 10 second, "i can just pop it out" question. %$* 13
right in front. %$* 13
the other side, david and mickey's side-- %$* 351
can you tell us your name, sir? %$* 13
peter bass. %$* 351
the other side typically cites the changing demographics of the country as a reason why the republicans can't succeed as a national party. %$* 351
i wonder if you could drill into that issue a bit more specifically on the demographics. %$* 351
yeah, i-- %$* 347
look. %$* 347
and 30 seconds for ralph. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
well, let me put it to you this way: if ronald reagan got the same share of vote among every voter group that he got in '80s, in the 2012 electorate, he would have lost. %$* 347
the electorate in '80 was 88 percent white. %$* 347
today it's 73 percent white. %$* 347
i think we've already stipulated that we need to do better among minority voters, younger voters, single voters. %$* 347
we can do that with conservative policies. %$* 347
that's the disagreement. %$* 347
we all agree we need to do better among minority voters. %$* 347
you can do it by talking about conservative policies. %$* 347
okay. %$* 13
that was discipline. %$* 13
who would like to respond on this side on the demographic issue? %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
i'll go. %$* 344
ralph-- %$* 344
i think ralph or laura, i can't remember which, mentioned how the republican party has collapsed in california. %$* 344
and apparently it was because of the mushy moderate policies of pete wilson and others. %$* 344
what i don't remember is pete wilson proposing a restrictionist immigration reform and destroying the republican party’s chances among latino voters in california. %$* 344
and that's what destroyed the republican party in california. %$* 344
i sit here this week, and i watch the republican party learning from the lesson of california and trying to do the same thing nationally. %$* 344
and i think that's about to happen to-- %$* 344
we're going back to pete wilson. %$* 346
all right. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "the gop must seize the center or die." and remember, we had you vote just before, and we're going to have you vote again right after closing statements which we're going to move to immediately. %$* 13
onto round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
those statements are two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is "the gop must seize the center or die." and here to summarize his position against this motion, ralph reed, the founder and chairman of the faith and freedom coalition. %$* 13
well, i want you to remember when you vote tonight, that we're not voting on whether or not republicans ought to compromise more, whether or not they ought to work with members of the other party to find common sense solutions. %$* 347
that's not what we're debating. %$* 347
we're debating whether or not the republican party philosophically should move from where it is to a point equidistant the two parties. %$* 347
and if it does not do so, it will die. %$* 347
now, we have lots of data to demonstrate that that's not true. %$* 347
i've mentioned some of it tonight. %$* 347
look at the exit polls in 2012.people asked whether or not they thought government was too big and was doing too much or whether or not they thought was government was too small and was doing too little. %$* 347
and a majority of americans said government was too big and was doing too much. %$* 347
41 percent of the electorate was conservative, only 23 percent liberal. %$* 347
i mentioned earlier that a plurality of hispanics are conservatives. %$* 347
only 23 percent of hispanics are self-identified liberals. %$* 347
now, the republican party may need to talk about these issues more effectively. %$* 347
you know, i think about what oscar wilde said. %$* 347
you know, sometimes you can tell somebody they're going to hell in such a way that they want to get there as rapidly as possible. %$* 347
sometimes the republicans have done that. %$* 347
but we're not talking here tonight about better candidates, better candidate performance. %$* 347
the gentleman who asked the question about engaging and connecting with minority communities, you can do all those things and remain an authentic, genuine, reagan-style conservative. %$* 347
and if the republican party doesn't do that, if it moves to the mushy middle, if it tries to trim its ideological sails and tries to be simply a democrat-lite, then the tens of millions of people who lick the envelopes, and knock on the doors, and make the phone calls, the volunteers who turn out on the-- %$* 347
on these primaries-- %$* 347
they will walk away from this party because it walked away from them. %$* 347
thanks, ralph. %$* 13
vote against this resolution. %$* 347
thank you. %$* 13
thank you, ralph reed. %$* 13
and our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, david brooks. %$* 13
he's an op-ed columnist for the new york times. %$* 13
we've had a lot of politics and some references to the dictionary tonight. %$* 344
ralph has his laura has her animus to george bush. %$* 344
i want to go back to the little girl i mentioned. %$* 344
i want to go back to the high-tech entrepreneurs looking for a worker. %$* 344
i want to go back to the young person saddled with debt, the gay or lesbian person in a relationship who wants to solidify that relationship within the covenant of marriage. %$* 344
the party that doesn't serve the people is going to die. %$* 344
the party that doesn't serve the contemporary problems of the age is going to die. %$* 344
those are some of the people who have to be served by a party in order for it to survive. %$* 344
i'm a conservative. %$* 344
i have some doubts. %$* 344
i have a lot of skepticism about government. %$* 344
but you have to use government in limited and energetic ways to serve those people that i've mentioned. %$* 344
you have to be willing to compromise to get a budget deal so the young person is not saddled with millions of dollars of debt. %$* 344
you have to be able to work for a comprehensive immigration reform so that the high- tech worker can get a job, so the young people living in the shadows have some chance of dignity in their lives. %$* 344
you have to be willing to use government in limited but energetic ways to re-weave the social fabric so the young girl living a few miles from here can grow up in a neighborhood that's orderly, so that people can have jobs with earnable wages, so that people have an incentive to marry, some of them men who are now drifting through society. %$* 344
and that takes more government than i would have thought 10 years ago. %$* 344
but that is the problem that's out there. %$* 344
and that's the problem we have to deal with. %$* 344
so, i may have moved more toward the center since i worked at the wall street journal editorial page or the national review. %$* 344
but i think i've done it because the problems have changed. %$* 344
and some of those problems demand a little more government action. %$* 344
and if you're stuck, unwilling to use government in any of those problems, then your party will die. %$* 344
thank you, david brooks. %$* 13
our motion is the gop must seize the center or die. %$* 13
and here to summarize her position against this motion laura ingraham, host of “the laura ingraham show” and a fox news contributor. %$* 13
this proposition i hope you will reject, because i'm going to buy you all after margaritas afterward if you vote with me. %$* 346
and it's the top shelf stuff, not the stuff they were-- %$* 346
i want to start by saying-- %$* 346
you're not going to believe i'm saying this. %$* 346
but i'm going to say you should reject this proposition that the republican party should seize the center or die because i have a lot of faith and respect in the decision-making that barack obama made when he could have gone that way. %$* 346
he could have, himself, seized the center. %$* 346
he could have seized it in 1985 when it looked like liberalism was on the run. %$* 346
he could have seized in 1994, when this newt gingrich guy just took the country by storm, love him or hate him, but changed the face of politics. %$* 346
he could have given up hope in 2001 and 2002 when the whole country was rallying toward this war in iraq, and he decided, "you know something? %$* 346
it's-- %$* 346
in my view, it's the wrong thing to do. %$* 346
because the establishment and everyone around him was probably telling him, "the center has moved. %$* 346
you've got to go that way."he didn't go that way. %$* 346
he had a certain set of principles. %$* 346
i disagree with him deeply, but he had a certain sense of himself and sense of principles that he decided to follow, and he followed in a new way by reaching out to all those disaffected democrats who were kind of tired of the old way and republicans who were kind of sick of where the republicans were falling down. %$* 346
and, lo and behold, barack obama, by not seizing the center, unseated the establishment candidate of, of course, hillary clinton, decided, "guess what? %$* 346
liberalism is back. %$* 346
i never let it go. %$* 346
i never moved to the center, and i'm going to bring along constituency after constituency in looking at the world and the country in a new way." he found his center. %$* 346
republicans, guess what? %$* 346
they know where they-- %$* 346
what they believe and how they believe it. %$* 346
seizing the new center is political death. %$* 346
please reject the proposition. %$* 346
thank you, laura ingraham. %$* 13
and the proposition is "the gop must seize the center or die," and here to summarize his position against the proposition, mickey edwards, a former republican congressman from oklahoma and vice president of the aspen institute. %$* 13
i should support the other side so that laura will buy the margaritas. %$* 345
look, there's just one simple question on the table. %$* 345
it's not whether ralph and laura are good people, which they are, who believe strongly in their positions or whether those positions are defensible. %$* 345
i'm a conservative, too. %$* 345
i agree with a lot of the positions they've taken. %$* 345
but it's whether or not they are positions that can gain in total the support of a very diverse nation. %$* 345
the republican party we have today could disappear and be replaced by a range of its little subsets, all these other-- %$* 345
a christian right party, a libertarian party, a no government, no tax party, a gun owner's party, a no gays and no immigrants party, each one with its own small niche of true believers, but america would no longer be a single nation of people standing together, and for the purposes of this discussion, then you will have lost. %$* 345
the republican party that once served as a viable noble alternative, a serious part of the national conversation will be, like the federalists, the whigs, and the know-nothings, irrelevant and disappeared. %$* 345
that is not an end that we should embrace, but as long as the republican party remains a coalition of extremes outside the broad range of reasonable discourse, that's precisely what will happen. %$* 345
we political people are kind of self-referential; we like to think of ourselves as thinking it's all about us, but it's not about us alone. %$* 345
it's not about just what we think. %$* 345
this is a big diverse nation, and a political party that gets smaller and narrower as the country gets larger and broader is a party that is doomed. %$* 345
thank you, mickey edwards. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to see which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads by your seats and vote your view now on this motion, "the gop must seize the center or die." if you agree with the side arguing for the motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree with the motion, vote for that side, push number two. %$* 13
if you're undecided, became undecided, remained undecided, push number three. %$* 13
you can ignore the other keys and we'll have the results in about two minutes actually. %$* 13
and so, while we're doing that, i just-- %$* 13
i want to ask your attention for a moment because this could have been a very ugly debate and it wasn't. %$* 13
it wasn't. %$* 13
i think all four debaters came to the stage respecting the fact that there are arguments on the other side. %$* 13
they played it that way. %$* 13
this was a good, honest exchange of ideas, and i think progress was made just in understanding where both sides stand. %$* 13
i'd like to give a round of applause to all of them. %$* 13
and i'd also like to thank every single person who got up and asked a question tonight. %$* 13
you hit the target. %$* 13
thank you to all of you for doing so. %$* 13
i love this. %$* 13
i think this is the first time it's ever happened-- %$* 13
and forgive me for typecasting, but i-- %$* 13
you know, i think it's the first time we've ever asked a probably overwhelmingly liberal audience to choose between these conservatives and these conservatives. %$* 13
so that must have been a challenge. %$* 13
we’d love you to keep tweeting about the debate. %$* 13
we know you've been doing it all along. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us.our hash tag tonight is #gop.our next debate is here in new york. %$* 13
it's on wednesday. %$* 13
it's may 8th. %$* 13
the motion is "the fda's caution is hazardous to our health." arguing for that motion, we'll have scott gottleib. %$* 13
he served in various capacities at the fda.most recently, he was the director of medical policy development there. %$* 13
his partner will be peter huber, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
he has also debated with us in the past and was terrific on this stage. %$* 13
arguing against them, jerry avorn; he is a professor of medicine at harvard who believes that when it comes to drug safety, the fda is not doing well. %$* 13
and david challoner is his partner; he is chair of an institute of medicine committee that found the fda's medical device clearance process to be fundamentally flawed. %$* 13
tickets are still available for this one. %$* 13
the 19th we will be in washington, d.c.in partnership with the mccain institute for international leadership. %$* 13
we're doing a debate there with this motion: "cutting the pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies." for more information, you can visit our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and as i set at the beginning, we're on npr stations, pbs stations here in new york, across the nation. %$* 13
we're a podcast. %$* 13
download us, talk about us. %$* 13
come back next time. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it's all in. %$* 13
remember, the way we do this, we have you vote twice and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is "the gop must seize the center or die."here are the results from before you heard the arguments. %$* 13
65 percent of you agreed with the motion. %$* 13
14 percent were against. %$* 13
21 percent were divided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, the team that changes its numbers the most from first to second vote is the winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the second vote. %$* 13
let's first look at the team arguing for the motion. %$* 13
they went from 65 percent to 65 percent. %$* 13
they picked up-- %$* 13
they picked up zero percentage points. %$* 13
zero is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote was 14 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 28 percent. %$* 13
they went up 14 percentage points. %$* 13
that's enough. %$* 13
the motion, "the gop must seize the center or die" has been defeated. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

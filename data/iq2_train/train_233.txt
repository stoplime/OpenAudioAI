jim harper, take that one. %$* 13
jim harper speaking for the motion. %$* 13
now, the question is as to the motto, and i would, i spoke to both versions, the actual, genuine meaning of the word evil, but what they may have meant, which is the sort of corporate greed kind of thing. %$* 600
greed, which as siva pointed out, drives them, wrongly apparently, to compete with ebay and microsoft and amazon, that's not an indictment of a company to say that they're competing with others, trying to serve consumers better than with whom they, than with whom they compete. %$* 600
by any standard google is not violating the “don’t be evil” policy that they put forward. %$* 600
jim, your teammate, esther dyson. %$* 13
yeah, the purpose of this motto is that these guys are smart, and they are aware of the possibility of evil, they're aware that their extraordinary success and their extraordinary ability to collect information gives them a lot of power, and they do not want to abuse it. %$* 602
the other thing i’d like to point out is that google, using google is voluntary. %$* 602
pol pot, all these dictators, they were not voluntary. %$* 602
google, whether it wanted to be evil or not, is constrained by the forces of competition, and it’s well aware of that. %$* 602
it has to earn your favor. %$* 602
it discloses to you what it does with your information. %$* 602
you can go and search your web history. %$* 602
so there, they're using their power to do good and to make the world more transparent. %$* 602
siva, you want to jump in? %$* 13
yeah, jim, you’ve fallen into my trap. %$* 603
so, can you get close to your mic a little bit? %$* 13
of course. %$* 603
so, you’ve fallen into my trap by citing the fact that every company should be expected to compete, and should, in fact, probably be extravagant, be gluttonous, be greedy, be slothful, be wrathful, and be envious, and of course, hubristic. %$* 603
every company should, because that’s what companies should do, they should compete, they should win, they should crush %$* 603
no, they should win, they should not crush— %$* 602
siva, you’ve fallen into your own bog— %$* 32
and by that, by that i say, it is for the companies to violate the seven deadly sins, and not to pretend they don’t, and it is for popes and poets to warn us against it. %$* 603
randy picker for, let me bring in randy picker for the motion. %$* 13
i hate to be a textualist, but i brought the registration statement with me, right, let’s see what it says. %$* 599
don’t be evil. %$* 599
we believe strongly that in the long term we will be better served as shareholders and in all other ways by a company that does good things for the world, even if we forgo some short term gains. %$* 599
the question is, when does google, faced with a conflict between what’s good for the world sacrifice its own interests. %$* 599
i don’t think it’s doing that. %$* 599
jeff jarvis? %$* 13
let’s look at yahoo, may it rest in peace. %$* 604
yes. %$* 13
shall we have a moment of silence for jerry yang, dearly departed. %$* 604
not good radio. %$* 13
continue. %$* 13
yes. %$* 604
yahoo was the last old structure, the last old media company. %$* 604
google is a new company. %$* 604
eric schmidt was asked recently by jim kramer how much they could make by putting ads on their home page. %$* 604
some untold billions of dollars, he said. %$* 604
they chose not to do that. %$* 604
is that good versus evil? %$* 604
i actually argue it is, because google recognizes that it’s not an end, like yahoo. %$* 604
it’s not an old media company, it’s a new media company that gets us to what we want to get to. %$* 604
that itself is a virtue. %$* 604
i think the problem we’re having here is defining the fall from grace. %$* 604
and if we all define it the way that you are trying to hold google, then we’re all going to hell, because— %$* 604
this has been a very theological evening so far. %$* 13
that word evil does it. %$* 602
wwgd. um %$* 604
and so i think that google recognizes that life is a beta. %$* 604
google puts out products and says, they're not done yet. %$* 604
they are wrong, they're incomplete, please help us fix them. %$* 604
google is not trying to say that they are ultimately absolutely virtuous. %$* 604
if we all tried to define ourselves that way, we’d be doomed. %$* 604
siva? %$* 13
so, jeff has compared google to wall street firms and said, wouldn't it be great if wall street firms had that motto chiseled in their buildings. %$* 603
he’s compared google to newspapers that have local monopolies, and pointed out that newspapers, of course, fix prices on advertising. %$* 603
and now he’s compared google to yahoo. %$* 603
none of that matters. %$* 603
it does not matter that any other company behaves badly, or behaves in an evil way, because none of those companies ever were foolish enough to chisel such a motto into their buildings or their financial filing statements. %$* 603
now that, the fact is— %$* 603
should they have? %$* 13
should they have? %$* 13
that google has set its own standard, and has not met its own standard. %$* 603
it has set its own standard, and i believe it has met it. %$* 602
it has aspired to do good. %$* 602
it has, as i said, engaged in an evil world to make it better. %$* 602
to me that’s the opposite of evil. %$* 602
harry lewis, do you think google actually meant it when it said that it wanted to commit no evil, or was that the most cynical declaration of all time? %$* 13
it was an aspirational statement— %$* 601
they meant it? %$* 13
and just as many of us make promises that we have to acknowledge we are unable to keep, google has been unable, virtuously and continuously, to keep its aspirational promise. %$* 601
i think it’s a good thing that google made that aspirational promise. %$* 601
the question is whether it ever violates it, and the answer is plainly that it does. %$* 601
esther, you were talking about china. %$* 13
harry says going to china, and essentially he’s saying collaborating with the regime, and i choose all of those words because that’s exactly what his point was, was an act of evil. %$* 13
and you're arguing that a little access is a good thing. %$* 13
it, no, i'm—a little access is a good thing, but i'm arguing something more important. %$* 602
it’s not collaborating with the regime, it is %$* 602
it is infiltrating the regime, it is spreading information within china, it’s exposing people to the virtues of knowledge. %$* 602
it’s changing their expectations. %$* 602
it’s creating more transparency. %$* 602
long run, you will see that google is going to change china by opening those cracks. %$* 602
every time you open a crack and insert something in it, it starts to crumble. %$* 602
we’re going to hear from your teammate jeff jarvis in just a moment, because he has something he wants to say. %$* 13
but at this point i’d like to bring the house lights up. %$* 13
and if you have questions, raise your hands, and we have folks with microphones circulating. %$* 13
i know that there are some journalists in the audience, and we’re happy to have your questions, we just would ask that you’d identify yourselves. %$* 13
and if some, in some other way you have some dog in the fight in a way that you would like to disclose, that would be a good thing too. %$* 13
no, we believe in disclosure regardless. %$* 602
jeff jarvis? %$* 13
even if you wish that google did differently in china, and i, frankly i do, i wish they’d use their power. %$* 604
the important thing is to realize the basis upon which they made this decision. %$* 604
and they used their “don’t be evil” pledge as a basis to debate and decide this. %$* 604
they made their decision not out of pure greed, but out of the belief, agree with it or disagree with it, but out of the belief that they were trying to do good. %$* 604
let’s go to a question halfway up, and again, passing the microphone down, and reminding you of our disclosure request. %$* 13
right, so my name is larry lessig, i'm a professor at stanford, and stanford gets lots of money from google for some reason, i don't know why %$* 605
but, first a comment to siva, and then a question for harry. %$* 605
the comment for siva is, it’s not actually true to say, siva, that google paid a hundred twenty-five million dollars for something that it originally claimed it could do for free. %$* 605
it paid a hundred and twenty-five million dollars to do something far beyond what it originally claimed fair use protected it to do. %$* 605
and it explicitly says in the agreement that it does not believe that its original fair use claims are false, as i believe its fair use claims are true, so what it’s done is just bought a right that before it never claimed. %$* 605
this is not settling. %$* 605
for people who are unaware of this settlement, could you take three sentences to explain— %$* 13
long sentences? %$* 605
i'm a lawyer, so %$* 605
yeah, but i think you can do it. %$* 13
we’re, you're talking about the publishing— %$* 13
right, so google originally claimed it had the right to scan these eighteen, or thirty-six million books— %$* 605
one sentence. %$* 13
and at least make available snippets of the books that were still in copyright— %$* 605
comma— %$* 13
but out of print. %$* 605
period. %$* 605
the settlement gives google the right to display twenty percent of a book, plus, if a user chooses, to then give user access to the full book if they pay. %$* 605
that is wildly more than anybody thought fair use— %$* 605
siva— %$* 13
would grant them the right to do— %$* 605
we’ll come to your second question, i want siva to respond to that, because— %$* 13
yeah, i’ll— %$* 603
basically, what’s wrong with, especially since a lot of these, millions of books were out of print, you couldn't get to unless you traveled halfway across the world to a dusty library, and what you can now get online. %$* 13
i don’t want to argue that, that making this material available is an example of evil, what was evil was the hubris in arguing that they could fly above the basics of copyright when they do it. %$* 603
and larry and i have had this argument going on for about four years, we don’t want to invite everybody else into it, nonetheless, we— %$* 603
no, no, no, we do, we— %$* 13
we’re at, we’re at loggerheads on it. %$* 603
but i do want to point out that of the hundred and twenty-five million dollars that google willfully paid in the settlement, people don’t give away money for nothing, they basically were paying the authors and the publishers ninety-one million dollars to settle the damages that were claimed by the authors and publishers. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
simple math. %$* 603
no something for nothing. %$* 603
the extra services that google is now providing will take up thirty-four million dollars of that that hundred and twenty-five million. %$* 603
so, in fact, the settlement was a concession that they probably had flown too close to the sun— %$* 603
randy picker wants to add to that. %$* 13
yeah, don’t focus on the dollars, focus on a different issue. %$* 599
so the basic structure of copyright law is, subject to fair use, you have to get permission. %$* 599
google has done something incredibly clever, evil, i don’t know, in the settlement which is, by turning it into an opt-out class action, and now i just said a bunch of legal words that you're not going to like, they’ve effectively changed the default position with regard to how copyright’s consent system works. %$* 599
that’s either brilliant because of the orphan works problem, clever, or evil, i don’t know. %$* 599
but bottom line, for those of us who aren't lawyers and don’t know the terms of the debate— %$* 13
yeah. %$* 599
did, did google serve its own interests in this deal? %$* 13
very much so, i think. %$* 599
maybe the public interest at the same %$* 599
larry, you have, larry you had a, from the audience, you had a question— %$* 13
they also served the interests of people who want to read books that were no longer available, and authors to get payments. %$* 602
thank you. %$* 602
larry, to your question. %$* 13
right, so the question to harry. %$* 605
so you observed that your reason for calling your daughter’s company evil is that %$* 605
thanks a lot, she’ll love you for that. %$* 601
is that it complies with the chinese rules about censoring a certain class of speech. %$* 605
during the political campaign that we’ve just ended, john mccain complained to yahoo, i mean, to youtube, part of google, that youtube was complying with american copyright laws and censoring a whole bunch of speech that he thought should be kept up on the internet. %$* 605
now, would you say a company is evil when it complies with american law and censors speech, or is it, or is a company— %$* 605
ok, we, the question— %$* 13
obliged to keep all speech available regardless of the local law that might control it? %$* 605
in the case of john mccain, i'm actually with john mccain in wishing that youtube would exercise a little more judgement before it automatically pulled the, the campaign videos down, although i understand the practical reasons why that’s important, and i understand why, under the safe haven rules, they would have the knee jerk reaction. %$* 601
but google actually could afford to review some of those videos in the middle of a political campaign to make a judgement about whether they were fair use or not, and i wish they had. %$* 601
but complying with— %$* 32
would the audience agree with that? %$* 13
those who agree, just a round of applause to that. %$* 13
and those who don’t agree, those who don’t agree? %$* 13
about fifty-fifty. %$* 13
we’re going to go to another question up in the, halfway up. %$* 13
who’s there? %$* 13
ok, we have one down front, to the, to your left here. %$* 13
and again, i will applaud a very cogent question. %$* 13
i’ve written it down, actually. %$* 9
excellent. %$* 13
just to %$* 9
i'm john i work for king features, which is an online company. %$* 9
and i must say, someone brought up the point, if you put “don’t be evil” over financial services companies, somehow they miraculously think that they're not going to be evil. %$* 9
i think that people that are involved with the mortgage industry and the credit default sweeps, i still think to this day they probably are doing probably the benefit and the goodness of the financial services. %$* 9
so here’s my question. %$* 9
if google is willing to limit search to get market share, what would limit them from disclosing personal search information of citizens to gain or maintain a market share. %$* 9
jeff jarvis. %$* 13
great question, when you got to it, by the way. %$* 13
with all respect, i think you're showing little faith in mankind. %$* 604
it’s not google you have a problem with, but man. %$* 604
yes, even in a financial organization there can be someone who would ask the question, force the issue, is this evil? %$* 604
and similarly in google, there is not only that, but there is also the self interest that google does have a brand and a reputation. %$* 604
and if google messes with us, we can use the internet and find ourselves on google to get google back. %$* 604
and we will. %$* 604
so google, in its enlightened self interest, i believe would not mess with us. %$* 604
ok, just a time check on where we are. %$* 13
we’re about halfway through the head to head discussion. %$* 13
just a reminder, i'm john donvan, your host and moderator of this intelligence squared us debate where the motion is: “google violates its ‘don’t be evil’ motto.” “google violates its ‘don’t be evil’ motto.” we have three debaters for and against, and we are, at this point, taking questions from the audience, and we have, yes i see you madame. %$* 13
hi, meghan keane with wired.com. %$* 606
i'm just wondering about yahoo and google’s search partnership, and, did efforts to stop google from forming a monopoly just end up speeding up the demise of its competitor? %$* 606
and, if you all have any thoughts on who might be able to save yahoo now that yang has stepped down? %$* 606
yeah, so on the question— %$* 599
randy picker. %$* 13
on the question of demise, i think that the question is, is microsoft, who wanted to buy yahoo before, still a natural purchaser. %$* 599
obviously the scuttlebutt in today’s newspapers and online is that the change in management yesterday may increase that possibility. %$* 599
so if you ask what the natural deal is, that’s the natural deal. %$* 599
it’s not obvious to me that deal will actually matter. %$* 599
maybe esther’s in a better position to talk about that, but that seems to me the most natural next move for yahoo. %$* 599
yeah, it’s, there are other acquirers, such as aol, but i think the most important thing to learn from this is that companies that get into trouble usually are not murdered by google or anybody else, they commit suicide. %$* 602
question from the gentleman in the center. %$* 13
i confess to being a father of a daughter who works at google also. %$* 9
i would like to ask the panel, either side of the question, where do the shareholders figure into this? %$* 9
are they evil, are you asking? %$* 13
pardon? %$* 9
are the shareholders evil? %$* 13
well, in a certain sense, yes, i'm asking that question. %$* 9
i'm asking what—we’re talking about google as if it was an abstract drawing, ok, when in fact there are these shareholders out there, and don’t they have a voice in how the company behaves? %$* 9
or should they? %$* 9
esther? %$* 13
i think google feels, and i agree, that shareholders matter, but not a lot. %$* 602
they, if their interests are short term profits, they can buy and sell and go away. %$* 602
what the founders wanted to create was a company where they were not driven by short term shareholder considerations. %$* 602
so, they're driven to some extent by long term shareholder considerations. %$* 602
they don’t want to sell their shares, they want this thing to be worth a lot in the long run, and i would say that's the basic attitude. %$* 602
but harry lewis, i think you are almost arguing, in your china argument, that you're disappointed that shareholders did not protest. %$* 13
oh, i think, yes, i think that google’s international reputation would have soared had they stood firmly against the chinese censorship. %$* 601
it would have been in their long term interests, as many of the other measures that google has made had. %$* 601
jim harper? %$* 13
as a shareholder question, this is very much like the question of people who complain about google but don’t do anything about it. %$* 600
shareholders are free to sell, and they would if google was evil, if they were violating their motto. %$* 600
unfortunately, they wouldn't actually— %$* 602
shareholders hold. %$* 600
esther, i don’t think your mic was on, could you make— %$* 13
yeah, i know. %$* 602
i don’t, unfortunately, i don’t think the shareholders would have sold if they thought google was evil. %$* 602
they're free to. %$* 600
they're free to. %$* 602
i also don’t think they would have applauded had google stayed out of china. %$* 602
they probably would not have noticed, to be candid. %$* 602
siva? %$* 13
someone’s been selling google’s shares— %$* 603
they’ve been selling everybody’s— %$* 602
well, exactly. %$* 603
but people have been selling google shares for reasons they don't disclose. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
it’s a simple signal they send to the market. %$* 603
nonetheless, remember that a publicly traded company that’s doing very well can afford to hold out a motto like “don’t be evil.” when things get tough, and as harry’s brought up, they have to make a decision between revenue and egalitarianism, they're going to pick revenue, as they have every time. %$* 603
we’re going to another question, halfway up, gentleman in the white shirt. %$* 13
yes, hi. %$* 9
i have no relationship with google. %$* 9
other than being a, a google user at times. %$* 9
so i, i wanted to just raise one point to the against side, that i have kind of a problem with the fact that, you know, you're, basically you seem, esther, i believe, esther, i believe, made the point that google aspires to, to embrace, or to, to live up to this motto. %$* 9
but i kind of feel like you're conflating aspiration with accomplishment. %$* 9
and i also feel like jeff, you’ve kind of made the point that, well, just because google has done, eight, or nine, or ten, or twenty good things, that that somehow would eliminate if they had done anything bad. %$* 9
but the question is, did they violate the motto, which means that they commit actions that are, that are evil, or acts of evil. %$* 9
all right. %$* 13
the point that, you know, the law professor here in the audience raised, of the fact that google is adhering to, to legal norms in whatever market they belong to, raises the, the profound problem for me that google itself has said that they aspire to be able to predict what we want to do before we know it ourselves. %$* 9
and, with the accumulation of so much information from people, which is not opted in, what if the, the government in some other place were to decide that google needed to share that information with people— %$* 9
i'm going to stop you there— %$* 13
or with the government itself? %$* 9
and thank you for the question. %$* 13
and there were a few questions there, but jeff, you had more of a challenge to your view than question, so— %$* 13
on the aspirational point, i think that your standard, then, is perfection. %$* 604
it is, in fact, god-like. %$* 604
because what you're saying is that if you fail at anything beyond this pledge of being evil, you’ve somehow failed. %$* 604
and i don’t think anyone here in reasonable mind would hold any of us here, or google, or anyone short of god, to that. %$* 604
and so, i also think that it’s important that, that your other issue is that, is this god-google omniscient, does it know everything about us, and can that be tapped by someone else? %$* 604
i think it’s a mistake to say, similarly, the opposite of the aspirational question, if that could happen, it, ergo, is true. %$* 604
if google could do bad, ergo it is bad. %$* 604
or google is big, and big is often bad, ergo google is bad. %$* 604
none of that follows. %$* 604
ok, and just for our radio audience, i just want to say, jeff jarvis answering that question. %$* 13
esther dyson? %$* 13
yeah, just briefly i want to respond to one thing you said, and point out the real danger here is not google, it’s the government. %$* 602
and governments have power which can easily be abused. %$* 602
google is constrained. %$* 602
it’s constrained by law, it’s constrained by competition, it’s constrained by its users, and it responds to those constraints, and that’s one reason it’s not able. %$* 602
but i think the other reason is, it doesn't want to be. %$* 602
siva, can you be brief on this, because there is a question— %$* 13
very brief. %$* 603
i actually want to echo what esther said, and again, just because there are more evil institutions in the world than google does not mean that our case, that they violated their motto, is not true. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
the fact that the federal government is much more evil does not absolve google of responsibility of maintaining information that can be easily, secretly gathered. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
if the fbi comes with a national security letter to google and says, we want to know everything about randy picker, randy picker will never know that that happens, and no one at google can talk about the fact that it happens. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
that’s the black box we’re dealing with. %$* 603
google is a black box, the federal government is a black box. %$* 603
the interaction of two black boxes are, is a serious danger. %$* 603
that doesn't mean google has done anything specifically, actively evil, but it certainly has enabled the potential of real evil. %$* 603
question all the way in the back. %$* 13
hi, kevin williamson, national review, which may explain the slightly thomistic tenor of this question, but this is really for those who are arguing for the motion, aren't you arguing that google is in fact violating a different motto, which would say “don’t do evil,” versus a motto that says “don’t be evil.” every business makes some sort of compromise, every business makes a mistake. %$* 607
everybody who’s ever paid a dollar in taxes has made a compromise with evil at some point. %$* 607
but %$* 607
it’s staying theological, and it was a great question. %$* 13
harry lewis for the motion— %$* 13
aren't you arguing against a different motto— %$* 607
i was waiting for this clintonian, or clinton-esque moment where the debate turned to the question of what the meaning of “be” is. %$* 601
are you going to take that question? %$* 13
i'm sorry, i was briefly distracted, i thought you were on a roll. %$* 13
no, i was, i— %$* 601
you were done. %$* 32
i was, my answer is really done— %$* 601
no, no, i actually think there’s something to the question. %$* 13
i,— %$* 601
the question, the question calls for an assessment of the totality of the company, not picking out individual instances where you don’t like what google does, and we’ve made cases that there are many, many of those are, are falsities. %$* 600
the totality of, the company invited this discussion, first of all, by having this motto, and now exposes itself to this kind of discussion. %$* 600
and i think it holds up well, given all that. %$* 600
well— %$* 601
harry lewis. %$* 13
if being evil means being evil in your heart, and they— %$* 602
ah, well %$* 601
harry lewis. %$* 13
esther, if that’s what they meant, they could have said it. %$* 601
they didn't say it. %$* 601
they didn't say %$* 601
they set the standard for the— %$* 601
they're brief, they're brief. %$* 602
they set the standard. %$* 601
unlike lawyers, they're brief. %$* 602
hmmm? %$* 601
unlike lawyers, they're brief and succinct. %$* 602
question down front. %$* 13
i’m vinnie mankovsky i don’t have anything to do with google, but i have two questions, one for harry lewis, the other is for siva. %$* 9
i'm going to ask you to choose one, ok? %$* 13
oh, that’s difficult, let’s go with the china one. %$* 9
having lived for twenty years under communism in bulgaria, and having been listening to the voice of america and free europe, which were broadcasted by the us mainly, and were, noised by the bulgarian authorities as well as the russian and everyone else in the east bloc, according to what you say, the us should not have actually radio transmitted voice of america because our authorities were actually, making noise on the same frequency. %$* 9
but i can tell you, if we didn't have access to this little information, we today would not have been members of nato or the european union. %$* 9
so how would you— %$* 9
no, no, they, there isn't a parallel between the united states voice of america and google. %$* 601
google is a business, and that, the issue for google only came up because they wanted to set up shop inside china, have employees there, run their servers there, and do business with, inside china, and there are rules inside china for how businesses have to operate. %$* 601
and if i can just respond to professor lessig’s statement, i agree that businesses doing business in a country have to obey the laws of the country they're doing business in. %$* 601
and my contention is that google made the wrong decision in deciding to do business in a country whose demands were so inconsistent with their fundamental mission in life. %$* 601
so there’s more evidence to how freedom breaks out in a country that i think people should consider. %$* 600
in czechoslovakia, vaclav havel was a playwright, and he wrote very obscure plays that the authorities didn't understand well. %$* 600
but the fact that people went to the plays, they talked about them, they were talking about revolution, they were talking about freedom. %$* 600
similar things are happening now with google’s help in china. %$* 600
they're using cultural references that the authorities don’t understand, and that google and nobody else can control. %$* 600
they're using language, they're talking to each other, they're communicating with each other, and they're finding each other through google. %$* 600
i'm not concerned about the— %$* 600
well, if i can just add— %$* 601
we have a— %$* 13
just to be clear, google is not actually the major search engine that’s actually used in china, so there are other avenues. %$* 601
i want to go to, in the little bit of time we have left, get in two more questions, up in the far right. %$* 13
one of my questions about china was just addressed. %$* 9
the other question was about the google chrome browser, which allows it to collect personal advertising information. %$* 9
i was wondering how both sides of the motion felt that it could use this as a force for good or for evil. %$* 9
the collection of personal information? %$* 13
yes, through the browser. %$* 9
is there, esther, a good use of the collection of personal information? %$* 13
sure, it can, if a user wants this information, it can be extremely valuable for the user. %$* 602
the user may want to share that information with other people. %$* 602
people keep talking as if users’ information was most, ought to be secret. %$* 602
people are now going on line voluntarily sharing it. %$* 602
they love comparing themselves. %$* 602
they like to compare their music tastes, they like to know whether they're hot or not. %$* 602
i like to compare %$* 602
my genome with other people’s genomes. %$* 602
and the ability to know more about yourself, to share it with other people, that’s what mirrors are for, and they're best sellers. %$* 602
i’ll show you my genome if you show me yours? %$* 13
siva? %$* 13
the issue behind privacy and the regulation of personal information is not that people should or should not, or do or do not want to share. %$* 603
the issue is a matter of personal autonomy. %$* 603
having the easy to access controls over who sees what in what context. %$* 603
and it’s a much more fluid complicated and multi- faceted question that simply the idea that we are putting our favorite music up on facebook in large, in torrents. %$* 603
that's true, but it’s not relevant. %$* 603
the fact is, chrome and gmail offer us no way to manage our personal information. %$* 603
google service— %$* 603
you don't need— %$* 602
harvest their, that information, and people use chrome and gmail without any real knowledge or recognition or simple acknowledgement of the transaction. %$* 603
most people who use google do not understand the transaction in which they are engaging. %$* 603
and that is a problem. %$* 603
our last question, from right down front. %$* 13
make it a doozy. %$* 13
i’d like some clarity on the definition of evil that we’re using. %$* 10
if an entity has a good goal and achieves them imperfectly, in such that some bad is caused by the imperfect achievement of those goals, is that evil? %$* 10
i don't see anything evil in spoiling your employees or in choosing to place some value on an ad-free search result such that it costs more for the advertisers. %$* 10
i potentially see evil in the decision to censor the results in china, if that was a decision made for the goal of, of financial return. %$* 10
but at bottom you're asking what? %$* 13
do we have any way of knowing what google’s goals are in making these decisions, and if we don’t, do we have any way of evaluation whether or not they're evil. %$* 10
siva? %$* 13
oh, we each have the capacity of judging whether any particular action is evil. %$* 603
i, of course, am appealing to authority, one of the classic fallacies, the authority being dante and pope gregory. %$* 603
but, i didn't mean to do so quite so facetiously. %$* 603
i do mean to say that all of the things that big, successful corporations should do tend to trample on the cannon of good and evil that we have been swimming in. %$* 603
and in fact, it’s hypocritical for a company to say that it will hold itself to a high standard. %$* 603
it’s perfectly reasonable for google to do almost everything it has done as a profit making venture, uh, and i applaud most of what it’s done. %$* 603
but the real question is, is this standard itself being undermined by its very actions? %$* 603
is the fact that it set this high standard for itself ultimately foolish? %$* 603
thank you very much, and that includes the head to head portion of the discussion, and thanks for your terrific questions, which, which actually were quite good questions, and kept things moving along. %$* 13
we’re going to move along now to final statements. %$* 13
this is the last chance that each of the panelists will have, really, to lock you in. %$* 13
they’ll each get two minutes to speak. %$* 13
but before we do that, i want to remind you of where we were in terms of the numbers. %$* 13
before the debate, when we polled you on the motion that google violates its “don’t be evil” motto, twenty-one percent of you were for the motion, thirty-one percent were against, and a very large forty-eight percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, we’re moving forward now to closing statements. %$* 13
each panelist will have two minutes. %$* 13
and we are going to begin with jim harper, who is the director of information policy studies at the cato institute, speaking against the motion. %$* 13
jim? %$* 13
well, first i want to congratulate and thank our opponents in this debate, they have a very, very difficult chore ahead of them. %$* 600
they did the best they could, and i congratulate them on what meager success they had in, in their arguments. %$* 600
important point, google invited this conversation. %$* 600
google deserves your credit for having this conversation. %$* 600
and as jeff pointed out, inviting this conversation internally as well. %$* 600
there is a culture there that is essentially good. %$* 600
there are decisions they have made that i have openly criticized. %$* 600
i disagree with some of the things google does. %$* 600
the totality of what google does, and the totality of what google is, is not evil. %$* 600
it is good. %$* 600
and i think you should support opposing the motion %$* 600
you should oppose the motion %$* 600
because google is, at its heart, a good company that provides extraordinary services to the public, and makes extraordinary amounts of information available to the public, and is working around the world to make information available. %$* 600
and the slights that have been heaped upon it by our opponents do not overcome their burden, we think, and we hope you think, that google is a good company. %$* 600
please oppose the motion. %$* 600
thank you jim harper. %$* 13
and making his summarizing statement for the motion, randy picker, professor at the university of chicago law school. %$* 13
randy picker? %$* 13
well, i'm both a lawyer and an economist. %$* 599
and as an economist i think the issue before us is what i’ll call marginal evil, incremental evil. %$* 599
i think that’s where we are with regard to google. %$* 599
that’s the question. %$* 599
when are they creating evil that they don't need to create? %$* 599
when are they making a choice that we should understand to be one that benefits google and hurts the market, hurts other participants in that market. %$* 599
where i started was something that went to the heart of their business model. %$* 599
this isn't a side show, this is not an experiment, this is at the heart of the way google does business. %$* 599
and what they are doing there is doing exactly what we see monopolists doing. %$* 599
since the sherman act was passed in 1890, they exercise market power. %$* 599
that’s what google is doing. %$* 599
we heard a lot of discussion, i haven't heard, actually, anything about that. %$* 599
i think that’s because it’s not possible to refute that, and i don’t think it’s actually transparent to most people how they're doing it. %$* 599
and when someone asks google whether they're doing that, google says, we’re running auctions, we don’t have power, notwithstanding our market share is sixty-five percent in the united states. %$* 599
that is acting in a way that is being evil. %$* 599
thank you, randal picker. %$* 13
summarizing against the motion, esther dyson, an investor in information technologies companies. %$* 13
esther dyson? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 602
the thing doesn't say don’t be incrementally evil. %$* 602
i, you know, when you have to sort of get down to these fine distinctions i think it’s clear you're losing. %$* 602
so, i would encourage you guys %$* 602
to join the winning side, and vote against this unsupportable proposition. %$* 602
google is not violating its don’t be evil motto. %$* 602
they are doing good. %$* 602
they are opening up the world, they are giving people more choices, they're giving people awareness of their choices, they're increasing transparency and people’s personal autonomy. %$* 602
mostly what they are doing, and the thing for which i give them most credit is, they're eroding the power and limiting the ability of those in power to abuse that power by shining light, and by encouraging people to change their expectations, to start asking for answers. %$* 602
they're giving everybody the ability to watch the watchers in this increasingly transparent world. %$* 602
so, please join us, the winning side, and vote no. %$* 602
thank you, esther dyson. %$* 13
summarizing his position for the motion, harry lewis, professor of computer science at harvard university. %$* 13
well, not everyone, esther, they’re not giving that power to everyone. %$* 601
“evil” was google’s term, we didn’t set the terms of this debate, the intelligence squared people didn’t set the terms of this debate. %$* 601
google set the terms of this debate, by putting that grand proposition out there. %$* 601
“don’t be evil.” some of the things they’re doing, they themselves know aren’t right. %$* 601
they themselves would prefer not to be censoring search results in china, and they have allied themselves with other corporations into a new consortium that is— and they’ve pledged themselves to try to lift this restriction, over the coming years. %$* 601
now, they’re to be respected for that, as they are to be respected for all of the other enlightening things that the other side keeps pointing out they are doing. %$* 601
but it’s not a proposition about on aggregate, are they 10 percent more good than they are evil. %$* 601
the question is, do they violate—“violate” is an active verb, that’s a—we won’t—okay, let’s not parse. %$* 601
do they violate their “don’t be evil” motto and i just repeat that the construction of censorship tools is an act of evil. %$* 601
thank you. %$* 601
okay, the motion in this intelligence squared us debate is, “google violates its ‘don’t do evil’ motto,” and summarizing his position against the motion is jeff jarvis, director of the interactive journalism program at the city university of new york’s graduate school of journalism. %$* 13
jeff jarvis. %$* 13
this debate, i believe, is not about google, it is about us. %$* 604
and it is perhaps a bit of an indictment of us. %$* 604
you know, the problem we have in america is that we love and nurture success until you become too successful. %$* 604
and when you become too successful we become suspicious of you, we even wonder whether you couldn’t do this any other way besides being %$* 604
evil. %$* 604
perhaps you do it by being smart, by being good, by being generous. %$* 604
by being innovative. %$* 604
i think that’s what google has done here, those are all virtues, and our risk, as a nation, by looking the gift geek in the mouth %$* 604
not a pleasant visual i’ll admit—  %$* 604
is that we lose this lesson and we lose this value and we lose this tremendous gift, that google gives us. %$* 604
finally, because i am a fan of google, i am a fan of the wisdom of the crowd. %$* 604
i believe, you are wise. %$* 604
so i am confident, that you will vote against the motion. %$* 604
thank you, jeff jarvis, and finally, summarizing his position, for the motion, siva vaidhyanathan, associate professor of media studies and law at the university of virginia, siva. %$* 13
lucifer did not fall because he wanted to be bad. %$* 603
like jessica rabbit he was drawn that way. %$* 603
in fact he fell %$* 603
he fell because he was trying to be great. %$* 603
now, i firmly believe that companies should be companies. %$* 603
that governments should be governments. %$* 603
that saints should be saints, that sinners should be sinners, that gods should be gods, and devils should be devils. %$* 603
the claims of corporate responsibility are basically, cyclical marketing ploys, disguised, disguised as something great and good. %$* 603
the fact is google grew as big and successful as it has, not only because it is great, and it is %$* 603
but because it claimed to be good. %$* 603
google never bought a super bowl ad, to my knowledge, google never bought an ad. %$* 603
right? %$* 603
google got big because in the early days, a whole lot of us who were very active on the web were disgusted by the status quo and we gravitated to google not only because it seemed to satisfy our needs, but because it satisfied our need to avoid evil and the evil in those days was number one, microsoft, and number two, yahoo. %$* 603
and in both cases, google was able to get—gain our loyalty. %$* 603
it was a cynical marketing ploy, one that in the long run, it will not and in fact has not lived up to. %$* 603
people really believed it was not evil, many people still believe it does not do evil. %$* 603
the fact is companies should make money, and the rest of us should beware. %$* 603
so please vote for the proposition. %$* 603
thank you, siva vaidhyanathan, and i’d just like to ask for a round of applause as we conclude the talking portion of the debate. %$* 13
so now we come to the moment where you decide how this all turns out, we are going to ask you to vote on the motion which i will restate once again. %$* 13
“google violates its ‘don’t do evil’ motto.” turn to the keypads by your side, if you agree with the motion %$* 13
push number 1, if you disagree number 2, if you remain undecided, push number 3, and we’re gonna have the results actually hurried down in just a moment and as they’re tallied, i would like to point out a few things that are coming up on intelligence squared. %$* 13
our final debate of the— our final debate of the fall season %$* 13
as you’ve jumped ahead on— jumped ahead of me on %$* 13
it’s tuesday, december 2nd, our final debate, with the motion, “bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years.” panelists for the motion are simon jenkins, a columnist for the guardian, and former editor at the times and london evening standard, and jacob weisberg, who is chairman and editor-in-chief of the slate group. %$* 13
against the motion, bill krystal, editor of the weekly standard and op-ed columnist for the new york times, and karl rove, former senior advisor and deputy chief of staff for george w.bush. %$* 13
this is all your way of reminding the radio audience that we are in new york city. %$* 13
this debate will be broadcast on bbc world news television, and to accommodate this particular taping we will be moving for this debate to the symphony space theater which is at 95th and broadway, and for more information you can visit our website. %$* 13
i would also like to announce the dates and motions for our spring 2009 season. %$* 13
january 13th, “major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money,” february 3rd, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market”— march 17th, “blame washington more than wall street for the financial crisis,” april 21st, “it is wrong to pay for sex,” may 12th, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere.” all of the spring debates will be held here again at the casprey auditorium at rockefeller university, with the exception of the first debate on january 13th, that is the carbon debate, that will also be held at the symphony space theater and tickets are still available through the website. %$* 13
all of our debates can be heard on more than 150 npr stations around the country, and you just need to check with your local npr station listings for the dates and times of the broadcast. %$* 13
and copies of books by our panelists are on sale in the lobby as well as dvd’s, and now, the moment of truth. %$* 13
the motion before us was, “google violates its ‘don’t do evil’ motto.” coming in, 21 percent of you were for the motion, 31 percent were against, and 48 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 47 percent of you agree with the motion. %$* 13
47 percent of you are against the motion, and 6 percent were undecided. %$* 13
47 percent to 47 percent looks like a tie, however, the side that changed most minds is the side for the motion, who moved 26 percent of you. %$* 13
versus. %$* 13
versus 16 percent for the side against. %$* 13
thank you to our panelists and thank all of you for joining us. %$* 13

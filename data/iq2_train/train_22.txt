do we screw up? %$* 18
yeah, a lot. %$* 18
that's what happens when you're a superpower. %$* 18
the lenses are on, your comparisons are made, which are not exactly fair. %$* 18
but the trick is to use what we have, which is the strongest economic system and the strongest political system in the world, to figure out how we want to make it better. %$* 18
will we get it with this congress? %$* 18
i don't know. %$* 18
will we get it with this president? %$* 18
i don't know. %$* 18
jim rickards. %$* 13
the proposition is, "is america in decline? %$* 191
" and joe's recitation of some of the great achievements of american history, and there's no disputing them, shows, where are the accomplishments, that the '60s were great, that-- %$* 191
you know, that many, many great things happened in american history. %$* 191
where are they today? %$* 191
that's precisely the point. %$* 191
those best days, those highest aspirations, america is a city on a hill. %$* 191
that's what's behind this. %$* 191
that's why we're in decline. %$* 191
we don't have anything to compare to that. %$* 191
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is, "declinists be damned: bet on america." and please remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
after closing statements, which will be brief, we'll have you vote a second time, and then we will present you with the results. %$* 13
on to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn, they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this, "declinists be damned: bet on america."and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, joe joffe, senior fellow at stanford's freeman spogli institute and editor-publisher of die zeit. %$* 13
okay, a lot of our debate reminds me of the story about socrates being asked, "socrates, how is your wife? %$* 188
" and he says, "compared to what? %$* 188
and let me repeat this again. %$* 188
remember, you talk about decline? %$* 188
we are talking about comparison. %$* 188
and we are talking also, if you wish, about progress, how we compare america then with america now. %$* 188
and-- %$* 188
but the most important thing is, "is there somebody-- %$* 188
" as we have argued in this country from decline 1.0 to decline-- %$* 188
"is there somebody who was better, more agile, more virile, more ambitious, more skillful? %$* 188
and will that nation overtake the united states? %$* 188
" and as i tried to make the point i was trying to make is that these challenges, we thought, we're growing faster, we're doing better, have all fallen by the wayside, which, therefore, then, made me look at the inherent and not the anecdotal sources of strength of this country. %$* 188
and if you look at the economy, the way this economy has rebounded while no other economy after the crash has rebounded, you must kind of say, there must be something here, or, we can explain it. %$* 188
why the country does better in those respects, if you look at the relative decline of japan, europe, the united states in terms of global gdp, that gives you a sense that, again, transcends individual stories and tells you something about trends. %$* 188
and that's why i think the decline is a good pedagogical device. %$* 188
and if you'll notice, half the time we spoke about how america should get better, which is a very good thing to talk about, but the issue is whether this country is declining vis a vis others and there you have no data whatsoever that makes the point. %$* 188
in fact, the opposite is true. %$* 188
thank you, joe joffe. %$* 13
the motion is declinists be damned: bet on america and here to summarize his position against the motion, jim rickards, chief global strategist at the west shore funds. %$* 13
i'm not sure how many people in the audience walked to the theater tonight. %$* 191
it's a new york venue, so i dare say some of you walked. %$* 191
new york is a great walking city. %$* 191
and i dare say that your walk to the theater tonight was completely undisturbed, unperturbed, and that's a great thing about new york. %$* 191
but if this event were being held in brooklyn, where my daughter happens to live, and if some of you lived in bed-stuy, i dare say you might not have made it quite so comfortably as the people here on the upper west side. %$* 191
you might've had your face smashed into a granite wall. %$* 191
you might've had handcuffs put on you. %$* 191
you might've been thrown in a van, taken away, taken to a precinct and strip-searched for nothing. %$* 191
no probable cause. %$* 191
completely unconstitutional. %$* 191
now, we call this stop and frisk. %$* 191
that's a nice euphemism. %$* 191
it sounds good, doesn't it? %$* 191
you know, you stop. %$* 191
you frisk the person. %$* 191
if there's a gun or there's drugs, you know, they got a problem. %$* 191
if there's no gun you know, just let them go on their way. %$* 191
you know, it may be unconstitutional, but we're sort of okay with that because, after all, we don't like guns. %$* 191
but that's not what happens. %$* 191
that's not what most people experience. %$* 191
they actually have this, i think, smash and strip would be a better description than stop and frisk. %$* 191
that's what's going on in the city of new york. %$* 191
now, also in the city of new york a few miles away you have the most corrupt enterprise in history called j.p. morgan and its fellow banks, citibank, goldman-sachs, morgan stanley. %$* 191
these companies have paid over $30 billion in fines, penalties, restitution, and compliance costs in the last four years and new cases are coming out every day. %$* 191
there was a new case in "the new york times" yesterday about foreign exchange manipulation. %$* 191
another one i saw today. %$* 191
not one single executive of any of these banks has gone to jail. %$* 191
not one has even been indicted. %$* 191
there hasn't been a trial. %$* 191
as long as america is a country where innocent bystanders are getting smashed and stripped and bankers are being left alone, america is a country in decline. %$* 191
thank you, jim rickards. %$* 13
that is the motion declinists be damned: bet on america, and here to summarize his position supporting the motion, peter zeihan, geopolitical strategist and author of "the accidental super power." %$* 13
never underestimate the ability of the americans to panic, learn the wrong lessons, and wreck everything. %$* 189
sputnik. %$* 189
beeping aluminum grapefruit. %$* 189
we were ahead in metallurgy, electronics, even rocketry. %$* 189
sputnik fell from the sky. %$* 189
three weeks later vanguard. %$* 189
our first satellite, still up there. %$* 189
as a result of our panic attack we re-fabricated everything about our educational and scientific system. %$* 189
we coasted on that for three-- %$* 189
i'm sorry, for two generations. %$* 189
vietnam. %$* 189
we lost a post-colonial war to a rice producer. %$* 189
it wasn't our colony. %$* 189
we didn't lose a single ally and we were the world's largest rice exporter at the time. %$* 189
as part of our overreaction to vietnam we have crossed what was then information technology with weapons so we would never have to fight at arm's length again. %$* 189
we got everything from cruise missiles to cell phones out of that. %$* 189
japanophobia. %$* 189
we became convinced in the 1980s that we had lost our position as the super power. %$* 189
not would. %$* 189
had. %$* 189
to a country with less usable land than massachusetts who we were occupying at the time. %$* 189
wall street forced the corporate reckoning that generated the biggest burst of capital that we have ever seen. %$* 189
we are reliably our own worst enemy, but we are also reliably our own best motivators. %$* 189
you want to talk about the next crisis that we're likely to cause? %$* 189
look at the aftermath of 9-11.we now have pre-positioned military forces on either side of every significant trade and energy artery on the planet. %$* 189
we are one waking up on the wrong side of bed away from perhaps precipitating the worst economic and military catastrophe this world has ever known and it's one that we would be largely immune to. %$* 189
so, declinists be damned. %$* 189
bet against america if you will, but do so at your own risk. %$* 189
the record just doesn't hold. %$* 189
i urge you to support the motion. %$* 189
thank you, peter zeihan. %$* 13
that is the motion declinists be damned: bet on america and here to summarize her position supporting this motion chrystia freeland, member of parliament in canada. %$* 13
my mother was born in a displaced person's camp, which you would probably call a refugee camp in germany. %$* 190
her family was fleeing the soviet invasion of ukraine during the second world war. %$* 190
and so, it was a particular personal pleasure for me to start my career as a reporter in 1991, in the soviet union, as it fell apart. %$* 190
i was in ukraine when it voted for independence. %$* 190
i was in belarus when yeltsin, kravchuk, and shushkevich signed the document that dissolved the ussr.and i thought then, as i think many people did, that that was going to be the beginning of an era when even more people around the world could enjoy capitalist democracy, this thing created by many countries, but particularly represented and led by the united states. %$* 190
instead, where are we today? %$* 190
today, as we speak, an irredentist russia has actually annexed, made part of russia part of ukraine. %$* 190
and instead of opposing this, some of these great rising democracies-- %$* 190
brazil, india-- %$* 190
are actually on russia's side because they don't want the u.s.to be a bully in the world. %$* 190
so, the world needs an america which is strong enough to assume moral and political leadership, whose middle class feels it has so many opportunities at home. %$* 190
it has the strength and the will to share those with the world. %$* 190
if we can't hang together like that, surely we will hang singly. %$* 190
now, we've heard from peter and joe that america sometimes screws up, but then it comes to its senses, changes course, and gets it right. %$* 190
i'm arguing this side, because i think, in a lot of ways, america needs to change course. %$* 190
denial is not a strategy. %$* 190
so, please vote for us. %$* 190
and then go out and vote in 2016, and start changing your country's course. %$* 190
it's really important for all of us-- %$* 190
but-- %$* 13
thank you, chrystia freeland. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seats, and take a look at this motion: declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push number 1.if you disagree, push number 2.and if you became or remain undecided, push number 3.and we'll give that about 15 seconds, and then we'll lock out the vote and have the results in just a moment. %$* 13
while we're doing that, the first thing i wanted to say was i wanted to congratulate the debaters for the quality of the argument they brought to the stage. %$* 13
really-- %$* 13
and i want to tell joe joffe, i apologize for calling you george. %$* 13
and i apologize for interrupting you if it felt like too much. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
george is okay. %$* 188
george is okay. %$* 188
the george part was okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
what were you saying? %$* 13
no, no, no don’t talk to me! %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and the questions were also terrific tonight, even the question that-- %$* 13
as you saw, the moral question-- %$* 13
that was picked up by one of the debaters. %$* 13
so, thank you to all-- %$* 13
everybody who asked a question as well today. %$* 13
so, on this occasion of our 100th debate, i'd like to thank our first-time and long-time audience members for coming tonight. %$* 13
we have a number of former intelligence squared debaters who are with us today, so you've probably seen them here in the past as well. %$* 13
we have members of our board and our advisory council. %$* 13
and to all of our friends, the generous supporters who make these debates possible-- %$* 13
i just want to say thank you, after a hundred of these things, for bringing this whole enterprise together. %$* 13
i also want to encourage everybody to please visit the iq2us.org site and make a donation. %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
i know that you've paid to get in here with tickets, and we very much appreciate that, but the truth is that the ticket price doesn't come close to paying the cost for it. %$* 13
we rely on donations. %$* 13
we have a lovely app that you can get on your iphone or your android phone, and you can donate through there or through our website. %$* 13
and it would mean a great deal to us so that we can grow and keep this going for another hundred debates. %$* 13
our next debate will be right here, march 11th, at the kaufman center. %$* 13
we will be debating whether the u.s.should adopt europe's version of the right to be forgotten. %$* 13
debating with us, we'll have a former director of global public policy at google, and law professors from harvard and the university of chicago, and the e.u. commission's director of fundamental rights and citizenship. %$* 13
and before that, on tuesday, february 24th, we're going to be holding a debate in washington d.c.at george washington university. %$* 13
the motion will be "liberals do not tolerate intellectual diversity on campus." for the full list of those debates and to purchase tickets, visit our website iq2us.org and as i pointed out our app allows you to download all now after tonight 100 of our debates and you can search for iq2 us to find the app in the itunes store or google play and you can watch the live stream. %$* 13
so, we're going to have the results in just a second, but we're going to do something unusual tonight. %$* 13
we're going to bring on a special guest with a piece of art for a few minutes who is going to celebrate with us our 100th anniversary in the form of a short rap history of iq2.i want to bring on baba brinkman. %$* 13
i need, as a disclaimer, this is a work of art. %$* 13
the views expressed will be baba brinkman's. %$* 13
they will be excellently well done. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome baba brinkman. %$* 13
what do you do when you’ve had 100 debates besides hire a canadian rapper to try to summarize them in four minutes. %$* 192
right? %$* 192
all right. %$* 192
welcome to the gladiator pit. %$* 192
where blood is entirely metaphorically shed with razor wit. %$* 192
the crowd is agitated only death can satiate it; they bay for it, also metaphorically. %$* 192
actually the crowd patiently sits evaluating each debater’s degree of persuasiveness while waiting for their moment to key all of their appraisals in. %$* 192
if you can think of a major disagreement of today, it’s probably safe to say that this place has debated it. %$* 192
everything from obamacare to designer babies. %$* 192
intelligence squared ,oh yeah the kind of crazy from politics to religion if it’s controversial they’ve covered it. %$* 192
they’ve had debaters christopher hitchens to arianna huffington. %$* 192
now in 2006, the culture of new york was enhanced by the godfather of this event, bob rosenkranz-- %$* 192
he saw the competitions they were putting on in britain and damn he thought new yorkers would want to give it a chance and bam a hundred debates later it’s still an affair, it’s got a buzz like phil collins can fill in the air, intelligence squared-- %$* 192
debaters are debonair like fred astaire. %$* 192
peter singer was here peddling unpopular fare advocating for euthanasia and rationing end of life care. %$* 192
robert reich persuaded a crowd such as yourself to tax millionaires. %$* 192
but karl rove won his debate, so it’s not just liberals in here. %$* 192
the proposition was george w-- %$* 192
the worst president in 50 years. %$* 192
debatable. %$* 192
michael crichton stood on this stage to deny climate change, followed by hurricanes in new orleans, along came the waves, and now michael crichton is rolling over in his grave. %$* 192
if you want to debate you came to the right place even the titles are designed to get a rise and make us irate. %$* 192
things like “millennials don’t stand a chance” “spy on me. %$* 192
i’d rather be safe,” hey “legalize drugs,” “don’t eat anything with a face.” some of the titles are provocative and some are just odd. %$* 192
“the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed.” “men by the way are finished.” wait, how about this one “science refutes god.” dinesh d’souza disputed that and got indicted for fraud. %$* 192
see most of the debate titles are actually pretty safe and straight forward and safe, except the hydraulic fracturing one. %$* 192
they called it no fracking way. %$* 192
so, how come the other debate titles don’t get a pun. %$* 192
this was “declinists be damned” but i think of a better one like you got to know when hold them, know when to the fold them, know when to walk away from america, know when to run. %$* 192
see, i don’t know if betting against america is a rational choice or if it’s just a feeling, but if it’s just a feeling then it’s one that’s shared by many such as myself and chrystia freeland, and i would’ve included you as well peter, but your last named isn’t pronounced “z-lin” so that %$* 192
see you know i don’t know whether it’s really going to happen, like, betting on america doesn’t seem hard, because i am a canadian right here applying for a green card. %$* 192
see or maybe the other side will carry it off, i mean here is a canadian stealing an american’s job, but either way-- %$* 192
look this place is no stranger to controversy, ayaan hirsi ali debated mercilessly. %$* 192
three out of four people would have said that islam is a religion of peace, but when that little infidel had finished her piece, well then after that 55 percent disagreed. %$* 192
booyah! %$* 192
you’re grandmother’s benefits, they were defended by howard dean and wait a minute, what about banning college football? %$* 192
only 16 percent agreed, but malcolm gladwell flipped that number to 53, the audience blinked and the tipping point was achieved. %$* 192
this event is put on an elite team. %$* 192
no embellishment. %$* 192
you’ve got dana from canada. %$* 192
lia, clea, amy and alison. %$* 192
you’ve got adelaide, not the city. %$* 192
and kris who does the research and it’s hard to overstate how much john donvan needs her. %$* 192
speaking john donvan, he’s a rock, mr. %$* 192
constant. %$* 192
82 straight debates, mr. %$* 192
cool, calm confident. %$* 192
nobody is better at telling an audience member their question is unwanted. %$* 192
although you guys did pretty well tonight, i have to say. %$* 192
but i swear donvan can moderate a peace treaty between brothel and convent. %$* 192
intelligence squared, it’s a new york city phenomena and tonight’s debate is about to make it 100 strong. %$* 192
give the audience what it wants. %$* 192
persuasion and clever statements and straight facts and make some noise for the next gladiator debaters to enter the cage match. %$* 192
all right. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
the results are all in. %$* 13
the motion is this: declinists be damned: bet on america. %$* 13
you have voted twice, once before the arguments and once again after the arguments. %$* 13
and the team that wins is the team that has changed its position the most in percentage-point terms. %$* 13
let's look at the first vote. %$* 13
the result was 49 percent agreed with the motion: bet on america. %$* 13
23 percent were against. %$* 13
28 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, those are the first results. %$* 13
again, it's the number-- %$* 13
whose team has moved the most-- %$* 13
it's the team whose numbers move the most in percentage point terms. %$* 13
let's look now at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, the second vote, they got 64 percent. %$* 13
they went from 49 to 64 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 15 percentage points. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see the team arguing against. %$* 13
they went from 23 percent to 27 percent, only four percentage points. %$* 13
not enough. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion: declinists be damned: bet on america-- %$* 13
has won this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

can i rephrase your question? %$* 13
please. %$* 18
and with your agreement to “the middle class has a better shot in a red state in a blue state.” if we were to rephrase it that way. %$* 13
in which state does the middle class have a better shot at staying middle class, or-- %$* 13
i would like the panelists to address the importance of a middle class. %$* 18
and whether you’re going to find the middle class more so in a red state or a blue state. %$* 18
that’s how i wanted to hear it. %$* 13
hugh hewitt. %$* 13
absolutely it matters, and i default to the catholic middle class in the 50s and 60s that wrote his wonderful book about. %$* 463
and how it provided structure, opportunity, and growth for legions of people. %$* 463
and the red states have, as i pointed out in my opening remarks, the greatest amount of volunteerism, the greatest amount of generosity, the greatest amount of those indicators of community that would provide the guard post for the development of a middle class. %$* 463
because we all project upon our children their success, our success, but what we’ve got to really think about is someone who’s rising, and where will they be nurtured if they are indeed in the lower class attempting to move to the middle. %$* 463
and i believe the rest states provide the greatest opportunity. %$* 463
why, hugh? %$* 13
why? %$* 13
because they have the greatest number of churches. %$* 463
the greatest number of volunteers, because they have the greatest civic involvement. %$* 463
they are not elites dictate to underclasses, they are middle classes prospering together. %$* 463
other side, let me go to michael lind first, and then i’ll come to you gray. %$* 13
yeah, if you look at the states which have the lowest extremes of inequality, the biggest middle class relative to the rich and the poor, they tend to be great plain states. %$* 465
where simply there aren’t that many rich people, and there aren’t’ that many poor people, they’re largely rural. %$* 465
many of them were settled by germans and scandinavians with a communitarian sense of the local public sector. %$* 465
so i don’t think you can make the percentage of the population the main criterion, because the great plains, apart from the ones with recent energy development, have been losing population. %$* 465
people have been moving away from that towards blue states, and some red states, which are more unequal. %$* 465
i think the problem-- %$* 465
the problem is also in opportunity as your economy becomes more complex you get more of a class system. %$* 465
you get more and more rich people and you get some who fall by the wayside. %$* 465
michael i’m not sure how you’re answering the audience member’s question. %$* 13
so if you want to live in a state in which the majority of the people around you are middle class, and you don’t have extremes, then you should probably go to nebraska or north dakota or south dakota or something like that. %$* 465
that is not, i think, the typical red state model that we’re thinking about, which is more of the southern model of low taxes. %$* 465
because those states, remember, were quite progressive in the 19th and 20th centuries and they have public banks in some cases. %$* 465
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
i’m sorry can you be very brief because we’re almost out of time? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i would argue that the blue state model is more inclusive and more concerned about everyone having an opportunity to achieve their dream. %$* 183
america is all about believing you can do something, and giving the opportunity to achieve it. %$* 183
it’s both in the interest of middle class, the underclass, and the rich for the middle class to do well. %$* 183
they’re the glue that holds society together. %$* 183
the better they do, the more are more investors. %$* 183
there are better stakeholders. %$* 183
i tried to help that by creating merit scholarships. %$* 183
you didn't have to be poor, but if you tested in the top 10 percent of your class in public school you got $1,000 scholarship every time you did that. %$* 183
i think we all agree education is the passport for a better life. %$* 183
we have to rethink how education can impose less debt on people. %$* 183
maybe by using online education in a blended fashion, but middle class folks are very important in the blue state model to be responsive to your question. %$* 183
right down front here. %$* 13
sir, you're fine where you're standing. %$* 13
that's-- %$* 13
we can see there. %$* 13
manny goldstein i've got a question for governor davis, but first i want to chastise hugh hewitt. %$* 18
i can't give you time to chastise hugh hewitt. %$* 13
please members. %$* 13
i'll give you my two minutes. %$* 18
go ahead. %$* 18
we just don't have the time and we're very strict. %$* 13
sir, i need you to ask a question. %$* 13
right. %$* 18
thanks. %$* 13
there's a lot of literature now about the hammerlock, which public service unions have on public policy and legislation in california. %$* 18
forget about the pension problem. %$* 18
is that something that california is going to cope with or not cope with? %$* 18
i'm going to pass on that question, because it doesn't-- %$* 13
i don't think it helps us understand the difference between the states directly enough. %$* 13
ma'am, right here. %$* 13
and if you-- %$* 13
i just want to check whether the camera can see you. %$* 13
call a state red or-- %$* 19
ma'am, just one second, because we would like the live stream to see you. %$* 13
is that going to be okay? %$* 13
if you could step out to where that gentleman is. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
calling a state a red or a blue state is defined by the governments and the elected officials, but this is not cast in concrete. %$* 19
we've seen a tremendous change in the state of wisconsin, for example. %$* 19
so, let's call them purple states, the ones that kind of flux back and forth and aren't predictable necessarily. %$* 19
virginia is a little bit in that position right now. %$* 19
so what is your question? %$* 13
so how do we move states one direction or another? %$* 19
what's the key for elected officials to woo voters? %$* 19
again, i think that what you're asking is already built into our motion, so i'm going to go on-- %$* 13
it's not that it's a bad question, it's just that we're trying to talk about, which place would you want to live in? %$* 13
i don't want you to go into it, please, because we don’t have the time. %$* 13
but afterwards you can chat. %$* 13
one more question, and i say that with respect, because i do think it's a very valid issue. %$* 13
sir, and again, if you could go down that aisle. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
if you could go back just to where that gentleman is. %$* 13
am i okay now? %$* 18
farther, okay. %$* 18
it's just-- %$* 13
you see that camera out to your right is trying to see this. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i forgot my question. %$* 18
i'm sorry. %$* 13
i want to talk about dependency. %$* 18
folks who are receiving welfare in general, we're talking about happiness. %$* 18
if you're highly dependent on the government it's hard for many americans to understand how you can be happy. %$* 18
could you comment on red states versus blue states and dependency and welfare? %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
it's not a question. %$* 13
i mean it's a question could you comment, but-- %$* 13
which is better? %$* 18
which states are better, blue states or red states, to reduce dependency? %$* 18
if-- %$* 13
in other words, if you're living in a life where you are dependent, which state offers you the better chance to become independent? %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
well, i guess my response would be is that a trick question? %$* 464
look, california has the highest welfare benefits. %$* 464
it used to. %$* 464
i don't know the last few years, but for the last 20 years or so california has had the highest welfare benefits and they've had incredibly high dependency on welfare. %$* 464
we saw in the 1990s one of the great social experiments in this country where states started-- %$* 464
and, by the way, red governors, states like tommy-- %$* 464
you know, tommy thompson and john engler, they really changed the welfare system, put in place common sense reforms like time limits and work for welfare requirements and getting people back into school, and boy did that work. %$* 464
and one of the things that's discouraging is a lot of blue states are moving away from those policies and put-- %$* 464
i mean, you've got a lot of blue state politicians who actually think it's a stimulus for the economy to put people on food stamps, and i'm not making this stuff up. %$* 464
they think it's good for the economy to put more people on food stamps. %$* 464
all right. %$* 13
both your opponents want to speak. %$* 13
gray davis and then michael lind. %$* 13
there are 26 states that refuse to participate in the health care exchanges that obama is setting up under medicare-- %$* 183
under obamacare, affordable care act. %$* 183
of those 26 states, all but three receive more money from the federal government than they send to the federal government. %$* 183
in fact, here's a list of the top 10 and the vast majority of this is actually going to poor people, because there are more poor people proportionately as part of the population in red states, particularly in the south, than there are in the blue states. %$* 465
new mexico, mississippi, alaska, louisiana, west virginia, north dakota, alabama, south dakota, virginia. %$* 465
some of this is farm aid, a majority of it means tested welfare and anti-poverty aid. %$* 465
so if the question is where are benefits at the state level more generous, anti- poverty benefits are more generous in blue states, which tend to be wealthier in general. %$* 465
steven moore. %$* 13
if you ask where the people in need of anti-poverty programs are they’re disproportionally in the red states. %$* 465
they have more poor people. %$* 465
it’s funny how blue and red hear differently, i heard your question as being in what category of state blue or red will a poor person have a better chance of not-- %$* 464
of becoming not poor and i believe that that is simply a function of where jobs are created and jobs are being created overwhelmingly in red states, and so if you are poor and you don’t want to be poor, if you want to embrace earned success which is in the happiness research the most important thing, read arthur’s book “the road to freedom.” %$* 464
that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is “for a better future live in a red state.” and now we move to round three and in round three we will have closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
this is their last chance to try to change your mind. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate? %$* 13
right after this, we’re going to ask you to vote again and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is for a better future live in a red state and here to summarize his position against this motion, gray davis, the former governor of california. %$* 13
well, i very much appreciate this debate being held here and i thank all of you for attending and all the participants. %$* 183
clearly blue states offer opportunity, longevity, better health care; more things are possible. %$* 183
do we have problems? %$* 183
high taxes, regulations, yes; everything is a mixed bag. %$* 183
everything has a flip side, but if your son or daughter or grandchildren are looking for a way to help change the world to make an impact on society, to reach their highest potential, they have the best opportunity in the blue states of the north east, the mid-west, and the far west. %$* 183
steven said to me privately what he said publicly, he said “my god, why would anyone live in a state other than california? %$* 183
” steven, i wholeheartedly endorse that sentiment. %$* 183
thank you, gray davis. %$* 13
our motion is for a better future live in a red state and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, steven moore, an editorial board member and senior economics writer for the wall street journal. %$* 13
one of the great, great-- %$* 464
thank you, one of the great, great, things about our country is, we are 50 states, you know, and you can choose where you live based on the policies that you agree with and it’s a wonderful thing by the way that you can move to california where you may have the policies that michael and the governor like or you can move to a red state and choose those. %$* 464
i would make the case that those are states that believe in kind of more of a free enterprise, free market system, but you can all choose. %$* 464
many of you in this room live in blue states, but i would make just a couple of quick points. %$* 464
just one statistic to think about, each and every day in america for the last 30 years, 1,000 people every day have been leaving blue states and they’ve been moving to red states. %$* 464
and i would submit to you that that is prima facie evidence that more opportunity, the very kind of opportunity you were talking about governor, the kind of jobs that you were talking about, hugh, those are being created in red states for one reason or another. %$* 464
the energy revolution or the fact that they have lower tax rates or less regulation or right to work, i think they all contribute to that so people can choose where they live and one of the things that we need to do in america, by the way, is get rid of a lot of federal policies and let states decide about health care, let states decide about welfare and work roles and so on and let these ideas flourish, but i would submit to you all if you think about america’s future and you really have to ask yourself this question, where is the future going to happen, america? %$* 464
is it going to happen in detroit? %$* 464
is it going to happen in new york? %$* 464
is it going to happen in newark? %$* 464
is it going to happen in chicago? %$* 464
or is it going to happen in places like salt lake, in places like atlanta, in places like kansas city, in states-- %$* 464
in places like austin, and i would submit to you the future is going to happen in the places where the free enterprise system is flourishing. %$* 464
the free enterprise system is the goose that lays the golden eggs. %$* 464
that’s where you want to be. %$* 464
thank you, steven moore. %$* 13
our motion is for a better future live in a red state and here to summarize his position against this motion, michael lind, policy director of the new america foundation economic growth program. %$* 13
thank you, where is the future going to happen, is steven moore’s right question to ask. %$* 465
in the last couple of years, stanford university in conjunction with google has driven hundreds of thousands of miles with its self-driving robot cars, which were the result in turn, of a competition sponsored by the federal government in conjunction with this leading california research university. %$* 465
i am from the red states, i like the red states; i would like to see california, new york, massachusetts cut down to size. %$* 465
i frankly-- %$* 465
i would, personally. %$* 465
i do not think in my lifetime i’m going to live long enough to see salt lake city, atlanta, and even austin, my hometown, be competitive when it comes to nanotech and breakthroughs in robot technology and world class finance. %$* 465
now that’s not necessarily the test, but if you paint this picture of california and massachusetts and new york, which have lead the economy for much of the 20th century and still do, in many high tech sectors, being emptied out as though they were east germany, and people are fleeing like boat people and so on, i just think that’s a very misleading picture. %$* 465
there are real trends, and it’s not a matter of good and bad on both sides, but i think that blue states for the foreseeable future will not merely surpass the red states, but will continue to provide a model, because the revealed preference, as hugh hewitt says, is the fact that when they move to red states like texas, the overwhelming number of new migrants are going to blue cities. %$* 465
cities that vote liberal and vote democratic. %$* 465
like dallas, austin and houston, which as a result of this migration have become much more liberal than before the people moved there. %$* 465
thank you michael lind. %$* 13
our motion is “for a better future, live in a red state,” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, hugh hewitt, professor at chapman university law school, and host of the hugh hewitt show. %$* 13
john, thank you you’ve been an excellent moderator, very fair and rigorous, and thank you governor and michael, great and worthy opponents. %$* 463
and thanks to stephen who actually made the case that i think we were done after round one. %$* 463
i really would like your vote, and i really would because i think it would send a message. %$* 463
let me tell you in 1998, the year that governor davis was elected, we passed one of our propositions, prop 10, which put a 50 cent per pack tax on cigarettes. %$* 463
and then that money goes back to the counties, to the boards that spend it on children 0-5 to improve their health and their readiness to learn. %$* 463
i’ve served on my orange county prop 10 board for 15 years. %$* 463
the problems are staggering. %$* 463
the amount of dysfunction in the urban core. %$* 463
the falling behind. %$* 463
the inability health problems. %$* 463
the onset of adult diabetes in children under the age of 12 is epidemic. %$* 463
learning disabilities, autism is skyrocketing. %$* 463
here’s the difference between red and blue: blue states have sclerosis. %$* 463
they cannot innovate, they are in the grips of special interests that have vested interests that refuse to allow them to do things that are necessary. %$* 463
red states believe in innovation, and i’m glad we brought up scott walker, who took an enormous amount of heat for attempting to change the basic paradigm of his state. %$* 463
in order to make these pressing new problems, which are global and transformative, you have to have political systems that will move, and will be nimble and will try and innovate and experiment. %$* 463
you need freedom. %$* 463
and the freedom that i’m talking about, the freedom that stephen moore writes about all the time, the freedom that we all share. %$* 463
everyone wants all states to succeed. %$* 463
right, i’m not against the blue states, i’m just trying to simply that if blue states want to succeed they will adopt red state measures and red state flexibility and mostly red state freedom. %$* 463
thank you very much. %$* 463
thank you hugh hewitt. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and register where you stand on this motion after hearing all of the debaters present their arguments. %$* 13
the motion is “for a better future, live in a red state.” if you agree with this motion, if you agree with this team, if you are with the team arguing with the red states push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, if you are with the team that effectively is arguing for the blue states, because they’re arguing against the motion push number two. %$* 13
if you’re undecided, if you became undecided, or remain undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore all of the other keys, they are not live, and we will have the results in just about two minutes. %$* 13
while we wait for that to happen i have a few things that i would like to say. %$* 13
first of all as bob rosenkranz said at the opening our goal at intelligence squared us as a philanthropy is to raise the level of public discourse, and we count on the debaters to bring a style and a tone of argument to our stage in order to meet that goal. %$* 13
and these four debaters just did that excellently. %$* 13
i really want to congratulate them for doing that. %$* 13
secondly on the whole matter of audience questions, i know it’s very, very tough to get up in front of a microphone and even tougher if the moderator says “that’s really not on point,” so to all of those people to whom i had to say that i sincerely, actually congratulate you and honor you for getting up. %$* 13
it's just that we try to squeeze it into this very narrow format. %$* 13
so, my apologies with respect. %$* 13
there was nothing wrong with any of those questions, and some of them might actually sponsor some pretty good debate topics for us in the future. %$* 13
so, thank you to all of the people that asked questions. %$* 13
and finally, we'd like to thank the philanthropy roundtable for inviting us to put on this debate as part of your annual meeting. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we would love it if there are twitterers in the crowd to tweet about this debate. %$* 13
our twitter handle is @iq2us. %$* 13
the hashtag for this debate is #redstate. %$* 13
also, for those of you who might be in new york later on this fall, we have a pretty busy season coming up on a range of topics. %$* 13
on october 30th we will be debating the global job market. %$* 13
the motion that night: "let anyone take a job anywhere.” on november 14 we are debating this quote, unquote: "the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness.” on december 4 we are debating: "don't eat anything with a face.” all of these will be live-streamed, by the way. %$* 13
so if you can't get to new york you can watch them. %$* 13
if you're in washington, d.c., on november 20, we are partnering with the mccain institute. %$* 13
we’re debating nsa surveillance. %$* 13
tickets for all of these debates are on sale now and for more information or to join our mailing list go to our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and as i said also at the beginning our debates are on npr stations across the country. %$* 13
so, all right. %$* 13
you have voted twice. %$* 13
the results are in. %$* 13
our motion is this: "for a better future, live in a red state.” the way this works, you voted twice. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms between the two votes is declared our winner. %$* 13
here is the result of the preliminary vote on the motion: "for a better future, live in a red state.” fifty-four percent of you agreed with this motion at the outset. %$* 13
twenty-four percent were against. %$* 13
twenty-two percent were divided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, you voted again. %$* 13
the team that's changed the numbers the most in percentage point terms is the winner. %$* 13
let's go to the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 73 percent. %$* 13
they went from 54 percent to 73 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 19 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let's go to the team against the motion. %$* 13
they went from 24 percent to 23 percent. %$* 13
they lost 1 percent. %$* 13
it means the team that's arguing for the motion: "for a better future, live in a red state," has carried this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donovan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

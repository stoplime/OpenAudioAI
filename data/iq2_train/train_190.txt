our position, is not that every conceivable market in human organs is ethically acceptable. %$* 515
rather, it is that at least some are. %$* 515
our opponents on the other hand, object to, and would prohibit, any and all personal reward being offered to providers of organs. %$* 515
they oppose payments for living donation. %$* 515
they oppose payments to next of kin for the organs of a deceased relative. %$* 515
they propose offering an options contract to healthy people for delivery of their organs after death. %$* 515
they even oppose the life-sharer system of giving a priority to transplant organs, to those willing to make the commitment to their own deceased organ donation. %$* 515
though in this debate we are not arguing in favor of any particular proposal to reward providers, i will outline one such proposal, the one with which i am most closely associated—an options market in deceased donor organs. %$* 515
i do so in part because i crafted his proposal precisely to try to accommodate every ethical objection i had heard, whether i thought it worthy or not. %$* 515
i leave it to you to judge if there is any substantial ethical objection that should bar its adoption. %$* 515
the market i propose is one in which healthy individuals might contract for the sale of their organs and tissue for delivery after their death. %$* 515
if the vendors’ organs are received and transplanted, a payment in the range of $5000 for each major organ would be made to a person or institution chosen by the donor. %$* 515
what of the objection to the poor being coerced by poverty to endanger their health by selling their organs? %$* 515
i repeat. %$* 515
in an options market, organs would only be acquired from the dead. %$* 515
no one need be induced or even permitted to sacrifice his health or bodily integrity for money. %$* 515
the donation of the organs of the deceased by both rich and poor is currently strongly encouraged, precisely because most of us believe that surrendering the organ represents no sacrifice to the donor. %$* 515
but doesn’t employing a market mean that organs will be allocated on the basis of willingness to pay, and so the rich will be able to buy organs that the poor are precluded from obtaining. %$* 515
some things it is believed are literally too vital to permit their allocation by ability to pay. %$* 515
had i the time, i would challenge this objection, and argue that there are fewer ethical problems in allowing people to sacrifice their own treasure to save the lives of those they love, than exist under all—what i, but not my colleague dr. %$* 515
friedman, view as the self-righteous yet cramped and craven and misguided unos system of allocation. %$* 515
but alas, time does not allow for that. %$* 515
for now i must underscore that my proposed options market does not speak to the question of to whom the organs will be allocated, only how they will be acquired from the original owner and possessor. %$* 515
my proposal is consistent with and can accommodate any conceivable system of acquisition and allocation, including, purchase by a government agency, allocation solely on the basis of medical criteria, and provision to recipients at no charge. %$* 515
note also, that the options market does not require next of kin to traffic in the flesh of their loved ones. %$* 515
instead it is one in which people contract to sell their own organs when they are healthy for delivery after their death, thereby taking the next of kin out of the decision-making process. %$* 515
the central premise not merely of my proposal, but of all the others as well, is an obvious, even banal economic proposition. %$* 515
if you compensate people for something, they will provide more of it than if you don’t. %$* 515
every economist who has written on the question including nobel prize-winner gary becker, has argued in favor of using personal incentives to increase the supply of transplant organs. %$* 515
the price of the prohibition on the sale of human organs, is the death of many thousands of people each year. %$* 515
were the suffering and death of the victims of this pernicious policy more visible, the stale and empty pieties about the sacred human body being despoiled by the profane market would be revealed for the vacuous moral posturings that they are. %$* 515
such moralizing rather than reflecting an adherence to noble principles, instead bespeaks a fanatical adherence to abstract, inapposite principles, by those who are well isolated from the horrific human consequences of their folly. %$* 515
it is not the payment for organs that offends human dignity, but rather the fanatical unwillingness to save thousands of lives by permitting such payments, that is a great offense to human dignity. %$* 515
one minute. %$* 510

thank you. %$* 510
our final speaker against the proposition is david rothman. %$* 510
the question that’s on the slide behind me, “we should legalize the market for human organs,” is a very prominent one, becoming more prominent over the last year or two. %$* 516
and you’ve heard from our opponents some of the reasons for the prominence. %$* 516
i want to focus you clearly on what this one means. %$* 516
it’s not what you just heard from lloyd cohen, about a futures option. %$* 516
that’s a wrinkle with building on cadavers. %$* 516
what this is really about, is the sale of organs from living donors. %$* 516
when you go to vote, you’ve got to think not about the cadaver, not about, you know, giving the family a little bit of a burial expense. %$* 516
you have got to think about, do we want to be in a system where we pay people to give us their kidneys. %$* 516
that’s the question. %$* 516
now i’m going to propose a variety of reasons to you, why i think that would be totally misguided, indeed maybe even self-defeating. %$* 516
let me start with the first problem. %$* 516
and that is that although it seems very commonsensical to think that if we make a market it will increase the supply, there are very, very good reasons, many drawn from behavioral economics, some drawn from past experience, that suggest that in fact, to create a market might diminish the supply, not increase it. %$* 516
in the first instance, if i can buy it why should i give it. %$* 516
all right, a family member comes down with kidney disease—please do remember there is dialysis as well, this is not just simply life-death. %$* 516
family member comes down, yes, i could give it, but i’m, you know, i’ve been pretty well-off these days, i can buy it. %$* 516
yes, the risk is minimal, but why should i take any risk, if i can go out and put down x-teen thousands of dollars to purchase a kidney. %$* 516
it wouldn’t make any sense, i wouldn’t have my children donate if i could purchase. %$* 516
don’t think easily that, if you create the market, altruism will not dissipate. %$* 516
there’s a wonderful example of this, the name should be familiar to some of you at least, richard titmus, english sociologist who studied blood donations in england and the us.what he discovered is that in england, where the sale of blood was not allowed, rates of donation were considerably higher than the us, where the sale of blood was allowed, eventually we move away from sale. %$* 516
the titmus data’s pretty convincing, watch out about markets. %$* 516
another example of this, i’ll do it rapidly but it’s a great study, took place in an israeli nursery. %$* 516
four o’clock in the afternoon you were supposed to pick up your child. %$* 516
most made it, some didn’t make it. %$* 516
and there was lateness, you excused yourself, you felt bad, and you tried not to do it again. %$* 516
then some wise social scientist tried an experiment. %$* 516
they told the day care center, the day care center went along with this, let’s institute a fine. %$* 516
so they instituted a fine, on the theory that if we fine people for coming late, the amount of lateness will go down. %$* 516
you know of course what happened. %$* 516
no sooner did they institute the fine, than the rate of lateness went up. %$* 516
why, it’s simple. %$* 516
it became not a moral obligation, not my duty to the caretakers, but a price. %$* 516
and if i could afford the price, i would come late. %$* 516
the data came in very nicely, these social scientists then added another wonderful little twist. %$* 516
they took away the fine, and then they watched the rate of lateness. %$* 516
what happened then? %$* 516
the rate of lateness stayed high, much higher than before. %$* 516
their bottom line, and they weren’t thinking of this in our context but it’s gorgeous, once a commodity, always a commodity. %$* 516
don’t experiment easily, once a commodity, always a commodity. %$* 516
i want you to take a different kind of intellectual exercise now, than the ones— they’re a little gory and a little dukakis— reminding of, you know, okay, your loved one needs an organ, what are you going to do. %$* 516
i want you to take a different exercise, and think a little bit about, what it would be like to live in a society where we had a market in organs. %$* 516
roughly the price, much higher than the folks have been telling you, we could—we would probably, i mean the economist put it at about 250,000. %$* 516
sake of argument, you get about $125,000 if you give your organ. %$* 516
now, first response of course would be, well, the poor—i’m gonna come to the middle class in a moment. %$* 516
the poor, will be out there donating and haven’t we done well by them. %$* 516
from everything we know in third world countries, the sale— frank already mentioned manila, it’s true in india. %$* 516
everything we know about it, you sell your organ, you’re out of debt for a very short period of time, you’re back in debt, right thereafter. %$* 516
the reasons for your debt are not gonna be rescued by a sale. %$* 516
secondly, imagine, even after this administration is gone, you have in your possession right there on either side of you, a $150,000 commodity. %$* 516
medicaid before you go on medicaid, you will sell that organ? %$* 516
i mean, think of the welfare system, where everybody’s got, you know, that kind of money, sitting right there— %$* 516
—and take it away without any problem. %$* 516
folks say, you know, oh, we’ll keep the foreign from doing it. %$* 516
why, if it’s such a great benefit, why not a green card, why not an immigrant. %$* 516
as you think about voting, just remember the great emma lazarus line on our statue of liberty, give me your tired, your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, dot-dot- dot, so we can have your kidney. %$* 516
let me close in my 45 seconds, with what it would mean to your kids, and what it would mean to you if they could do it. %$* 516
we’ve got some good, enterprising folks from wall street in the audience i’m sure. %$* 516
125,000 tax-free invested when you’re 18, mighty tempting. %$* 516
when do you tell your prospective bride that you can pay the down payment, what do you do when your father-in-law turns to you and says have you sold your kidney yet. %$* 516
what do you— %$* 516
—when your kid comes—i’ll close with this— and he says, i want to go the ivy league, not to my state school, and you as the parent say, i can’t afford it, but you’ve got your kidney. %$* 516
one minute— %$* 510
—and take it away without any problem. %$* 516
folks say, you know, oh, we’ll keep the foreign from doing it. %$* 516
why, if it’s such a great benefit, why not a green card, why not an immigrant. %$* 516
as you think about voting, just remember the great emma lazarus line on our statue of liberty, give me your tired, your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, dot-dot- dot, so we can have your kidney. %$* 516
let me close in my 45 seconds, with what it would mean to your kids, and what it would mean to you if they could do it. %$* 516
we’ve got some good, enterprising folks from wall street in the audience i’m sure. %$* 516
125,000 tax-free invested when you’re 18, mighty tempting. %$* 516
when do you tell your prospective bride that you can pay the down payment, what do you do when your father-in-law turns to you and says have you sold your kidney yet. %$* 516
what do you— %$* 516
time’s up— %$* 510
—when your kid comes—i’ll close with this— and he says, i want to go the ivy league, not to my state school, and you as the parent say, i can’t afford it, but you’ve got your kidney. %$* 516
thank you. %$* 510
i’m going to just take the opportunity before we move on, it’s the prerogative as the host or chair, whatever we call my seat, to ask a couple of questions about what we just heard and i want to ask lloyd, who is very, very— feels very strongly about it—is very animated about this topic. %$* 510
you just sat here and listened to this. %$* 510
gahhh! %$* 515
was %$* 510
you know, he made a very emotional case about, you know, everything that you don’t believe in on this topic. %$* 510
what is your reaction to %$* 510
you know, would you want to live in a society where a kidney sells, where all 18-to-20-year-olds can sell a kidney for $50,000 or $100,000 to pay for an education? %$* 510
are we going down the road to hell, do we— %$* 510
no. %$* 515
he—well. %$* 515
first of all, david, he wants you to answer a different question when you vote later. %$* 515
he wants it to be the question on live kidney sales. %$* 515
well, that isn’t the resolution. %$* 515
the resolution is quite clear, should we legalize the market for human organs. %$* 515
so he gives you the list of horribles of the worst conceivable market, and says, vote against that. %$* 515
i tell you, there’s a slew of possible markets, many of them quite innocent including merely a cadaveric market. %$* 515
clearly distinguishable. %$* 515
and that falls within this notion of a market in organs. %$* 515
now, there’s no more reason to think that— or i can see no particular—i can’t imagine a society, in which people would feel pressured, you know, to sell an organ for cash. %$* 515
it’s an evasion. %$* 515
and it’s just a list of horribles, that doesn’t exist— %$* 515
okay— %$* 510
—anywhere, and that will not exist here. %$* 515
david, you want to answer that? %$* 510
i can do it quickly. %$* 516
trust me, we wouldn’t be here, if we were talking about annuities for cadaveric organs. %$* 516
the reason we’re here— %$* 516
that’s “cadaver,” right, “cadaveric”— %$* 510
yes, sorry— %$* 516
okay, just— %$* 510
no— %$* 516
my radio thing— %$* 510
oh, okay— %$* 516
—coming through with it. %$* 510
we wouldn’t be here if we were talking about futures markets, we’re here for one— %$* 516
that’s not true. %$* 515
what— %$* 516
i’ve been arguing for this for 20 years— %$* 515
you— but you’re not what’s captured the public attention and you’re not what’s driving the interest. %$* 516
what’s driving the interest— %$* 516
really— %$* 515
—is— you’re not. %$* 516
i’m very %$* 515
what’s driving the interest is, donation from living folks. %$* 516
none of us—look, we could quibble over this or that with a futures market— already i thought we heard— %$* 516
so you’re willing to switch sides and come to— %$* 515
no, no, i’m not— %$* 516
—this side and be with me on that one. %$* 515
no—the reason why i wouldn’t switch sides— %$* 516
ah— %$* 515
—with you, is because of my fear of the contagion effect. %$* 516
if we— %$* 516
oh, the slippery slope nonsense— %$* 515
all right—gentlemen— gentlemen— we will get a chance— %$* 510
there is no slope here— %$* 515
gentlemen— %$* 510
there are sharp, clear ledges. %$* 515
i’m using the wrong phraseology. %$* 510
maybe we shouldn’t call you gentlemen. %$* 510
um— we’ll get this eventually, we’ll get to this, we, we have a time for open discussion, you can open that wound up again and it sounds like it’s got an interesting place to go. %$* 510
but let me move on and announce the result of our pre-debate vote, you all voted on the machines, you’d like to know how you voted. %$* 510
let me begin by reading the results. %$* 510
they up there on the screen? %$* 510
we had “for,” 44 percent, “against,” 27 percent, and “undecided,” 29 percent. %$* 510
so it was a large %$* 510
well, we—it’s a large portion, i’ll read it, “for” was 44 percent, “against” 27 percent, and “undecided,” 29 percent. %$* 510
so we had a more people who are undecided than who are against it, there’s a large percentage of people still trying to decide that vote. %$* 510
we’ll take the vote again later. %$* 510
so we’ll see how the debate may have changed your opinion, but let’s move on now because i think, things are just getting interesting. %$* 510
i’m going to have our panelists pose a question to the other side, one from each side, pose a question themselves and ask them if they have a question they’d like to have somebody answer. %$* 510
let me begin with, on the “for” side, sally satel? %$* 510
okay, so i can address my question— %$* 512
you can ask a— %$* 510
okay. %$* 512
preferably to one of them. %$* 510
yes, dr. %$* 512
childress, i wanted to ask you %$* 512
in nineteen—i’m going to quote you something you wrote in 1992.and then we work up. %$* 512
you said, “it would be odd to structure a system designed to promote altruistic behavior, with the result of saving human life”—and you’re referring to the unos system— “when a system that relied on financial incentives could save more lives.” so i took this to mean that an altruistic system would be preferable to an incentive system, if it saved more lives, an incentive system would be preferable to an altruistic system if it could be shown to save more lives. %$* 512
well, okay, that was 1992.fast-forward 14 years to 2006 when you were the head of the institute of medicine report on organ donation. %$* 512
and in answer to the question that the report posed, what should we do about even considering, even pursuing a pilot trial of incentives, you had said—or the report said, but i know you concurred—“it is not time yet.” now the report spent a lot of time—i’ll be quick—on cadaver donation. %$* 512
i’ll just say very quickly %$* 512
believe it or not, even though two million people die a year, perhaps 20,000 are eligible to become organ donors, it’s just not that easy to be eligible, as a cadaver, so even if we used every deceased person, there wouldn’t be enough. %$* 512
so your focus on deceased donation would not help. %$* 512
i’m all for it, let a thousand organs bloom, i’ve never heard a policy frankly i didn’t like, that would increase. %$* 512
but that’s not gonna be enough. %$* 512
so my question to you is— %$* 512
i was wondering when we’d get to that— %$* 510
—if not—we’ll get to—here it is. %$* 512
if it wasn’t time then, in 2006, when is it going to be time. %$* 512
how many more people are going to have to die until we can have your permission, to finally, at least have a trial of incentives. %$* 512
first of all, i still affirm all those positions and they’re not incompatible with each other. %$* 513
basically, my view is that, we should give the kind of system we have preference—and by the way, it’s not simply an altruistic system. %$* 513
people have a lot of different motives for donating organs. %$* 513
we get confused when we identify altruism with donation. %$* 513
people are often donating, say for example because they want to gain some meaning out of a tragedy that’s occurred. %$* 513
they may be donating as a living person, an organ again because of the relationships involved, but don’t have to do specifically with altruism. %$* 513
i think we have not yet given a fair chance to the system we have, in that we have not yet put the resources and energy into it. %$* 513
okay? %$* 513
that is one person’s judgment about it, i see amy frowning a great deal but you’ll get to respond to it in a moment, i still have— since the question was five minutes long i get that much time in response. %$* 513
it was actually two-thirty— %$* 510
it’s only three minutes. %$* 512
now %$* 513
there are only 13,000 to 16,000 people who are declared dead by neurological standards, who could probably donate organs. %$* 513
there are another, on a conservative estimate, 20,000-plus who are declared dead by cardiopulmonary standards, and that is a direction that the irm report recommended, that at least merits a trial but since i happen to agree with lloyd on this, not much else, but at least on this, that we ought to be giving preference to the cadaveric system over the living in part because as amy noted, we actually don’t know a lot about the long-term risks, which we do need to know. %$* 513
so it’s a matter of structuring this in terms of preferential systems, and the irm report did not rule it out completely, that held, that let’s— %$* 513
okay— %$* 510
—see if this will work. %$* 513
i’m going to give you an opportunity now, james, to ask a question if you’d like. %$* 510
you don’t have to— %$* 510
oh, i will— %$* 513
i thought you might, to any of our panelists. %$* 510
lloyd, you know that i find much about your %$* 513
do we all get a question? %$* 514
yes. %$* 510
okay. %$* 514
you’ll get— i know you’re chomping at the bit— %$* 510
frank, you get two questions. %$* 515
i have to get out the boxing gloves for you guys. %$* 510
that’s fine. %$* 514
okay, go ahead. %$* 510
let me raise this of lloyd, because, lloyd, other than, perhaps sensing a kind of market fundamentalism here, i cannot for the life of me see how you think the system you propose would work. %$* 513
if donors, now %$* 513
people who are potential donors are not willing to sign a donor card because they don’t trust the system, they worry that they’ll be declared dead prematurely, or have their deaths hastened, why would anyone be willing to sign a contract for a delivery of organs after his or her death, for money, when that would seem to me to be the least trustworthy system. %$* 513
all right— %$* 510
so if you can answer that— %$* 513
—brief—brief— %$* 510
—i’d be grateful— %$* 513
—brief question, brief answer— %$* 510
okay— %$* 515
—from lloyd. %$* 510
if james %$* 515
he asserts, people are not willing to sign now, because they’re, they don’t trust the system and they’re afraid of being declared prematurely dead. %$* 515
where does he get his information from? %$* 515
from idiot surveys. %$* 515
no good social scientist relies on such evidence. %$* 515
you—no economist ever wants to make use of a survey. %$* 515
people say anything in a survey. %$* 515
surveys are not a test of anything. %$* 515
use a little bit of introspection as to why it is you may or may not sign an organ donor card. %$* 515
people in general don’t want to contemplate their own violent, immediate, surprising death and dismemberment. %$* 515
okay. %$* 513
great surprise! %$* 515
okay. %$* 515
in my conclusion i’ll explain why it is that the market will work, but i— %$* 515
all right, okay— %$* 513
ira’s not gonna give me any more time— %$* 515
i got it— %$* 513
even though i deserve more than anyone else. %$* 515
just ‘cause you look like mel brooks doesn’t mean you get the extra time, so— so hang in there, amy, it’s your turn to— %$* 510
okay, before i get to my question i do wanna respond to what james said about the system— %$* 511
no, no, we’re %$* 510
no, no, no, he—he specifically, responded— %$* 511
this is gonna be your question then. %$* 510
mmm, well, i agree with him, that the system should be given every opportunity, we just can’t wait for all the people to die, right now, so we all want the system to work, we all want all of these efforts, we just can’t wait. %$* 511
now the question. %$* 511
and this is for james. %$* 511
if you object to paying live donors because the poor would allegedly be coerced by poverty into making an unwise choice, do you have any objections to the middle class selling a kidney. %$* 511
it would not be difficult to restrict organ sales to those whose income is at least 70 percent of the american median. %$* 511
sure, that would make kidneys more expensive, we could live with that. %$* 511
how about you? %$* 511
does taking the desperately poor out of the picture make you relent, or do you now move to the paternalistic position that no one should accept any amount of money. %$* 511
the issue has to do in part with relative deprivation, disadvantage, i used several different terms in the discussion, disadvantage being one of them, that’s often relative rather than absolute in regard to say, poverty level. %$* 513
i think that the way you’re raising the question here, i focus on obviously the extreme version of it, those in desperate straits— the problem we think we—i think we would have is one that my colleagues also raised and that is, once you set up a system, you’re not going to be able to restrict it to the kind of level you indicated, %$* 513
set it in terms of income level. %$* 513
because you’re going to be then charged with discrimination against the poor and their opportunity to obtain it, that—the system would be unstable, the way you’ve sketched it. %$* 513
so your objection is practical, not ethical or moral? %$* 511
no, i’ve given an ethical one but i’m just saying in response to your question, that that would be the problem with the system you’ve proposed. %$* 513
okay. %$* 510
next question, frank, you can— %$* 510
so this is for amy. %$* 514
and i do so asking her in the reality of, now the market exists. %$* 514
the market that dr. %$* 514
friedman wants to have, now exists. %$* 514
she’s a transplant surgeon, she’s got a 72-year-old patient in front of her, and by her market system, there’s a 56- year-old middle class, who’s before her as well. %$* 514
the 56-year-old has come forward, and is prepared to sell his or her kidney, his kidney, and now i’d like to know from dr. %$* 514
friedman the following. %$* 514
would you advise your 72-year-old patient to accept a 56- or 60- year-old, when the insurance company of this patient is saying, we can get you to india tomorrow, and we can have a twen— we can get you to manila tomorrow, and we can have a 20-year- old kidney for you. %$* 514
if the alternative is that the patient could go out of country for a 20-year-old, versus your market system that will only provide the 56- or 60-year-old, what would you advise. %$* 514
your patient. %$* 514

the construct of the system has to be along the lines of what we have with medicare now and that is that, patients who currently go out of this country to have transplants at non-medicare- approved transplant centers don’t have their medications paid for subsequently. %$* 511
that’s not true. %$* 514
that's prohibited. %$* 511
but it’s not true. %$* 514
what is— %$* 511
end of discussion, that's not true. %$* 514
you can come back and have your medications still, if you're medicare eligible, you’ll have your medications paid— %$* 514
frank, we’re now required to inform every patient— %$* 511
well, let’s go back, let’s go back to— %$* 514
wait, you asked her a question, let, let— %$* 510
frank, we are now required to inform every patient that if they don’t have their transplant performed at a medicare-approved center, medicare won't pay for their medications. %$* 511
that’s the type of system that we ought to proceed with, the same kind of— %$* 511
is this patient going out of country, is the patient going out of country or not? %$* 514
they shouldn't be permitted to, because they won't have access to medications and other care. %$* 511
okay, lloyd, you get a chance to ask a question. %$* 510
okay, my, mine is a question for frank. %$* 515
now, unlike the other participants in this debate, i'm not a good and generous person. %$* 515
it’s true, ask my daughter, she’s there. %$* 515
i am so callous and uncaring that i wrote a codicil to my will disinheriting any member of my family who consents to the donation of any of my organs, unless they are paid at least eight hundred and sixty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents per organ. %$* 515
i posted this on my web page, and other people have downloaded it and amended their wills accordingly. %$* 515
now, i ask you, dr. %$* 515
pangloss, i'm sorry, i mean dr. %$* 515
delmonico %$* 515
is your objection to my estate profiting from the salvaging of my organs so strong that you think it just and right to threaten innocent sick people with prison for purchasing my organ? %$* 515
is there some great ethical principle that i do not understand under which the sick should be condemned to die rather than obtain organs from the self-interested and even selfish? %$* 515
well, the problem isn't that they would have to buy your organs, it’s that they would go elsewhere. %$* 514
they won't want your organs, lloyd. %$* 514
they're going to go to manila for the twenty year old. %$* 514
thank you. %$* 514
i don’t think that was an answer, frank. %$* 515
well, yes it is an answer. %$* 514
the answer is that they're going to be in a position when you have legalized markets to say, who wants your organs in your circumstance when i can go to manila to buy one from a twenty year old? %$* 514
well— %$* 515
that’s the answer. %$* 514
sally wants, i'm going to break the rules a little, sally wants to jump in. %$* 510
she’s the only one who’s ever bought an organ here— %$* 510
or thought about it. %$* 512
or thought about it, so— %$* 510
i did think about it. %$* 512
let’s get some practical— %$* 510
frank, i don’t understand. %$* 512
we can do that now. %$* 512
i can go to manila now, so i don't see why having a mechanism where organs can be compensated for by a third party makes any difference at all. %$* 512
the point is, sally, that i’d like you to see what it looks like to go to manila— %$* 514
well, the reason i would have to go to manila— %$* 512
and now, and the point is— %$* 514
is because i couldn't buy it here— %$* 512
if you say, in the united states, it’s legal to have a market in the us, then you're going to set up a global competition for buyers. %$* 514
and the rich people will, why should we stay here? %$* 514
why should the insurance companies— %$* 514
frank! %$* 512
we can do that now. %$* 512
and the point is, you’ll— %$* 514
and people will stay here if they can get it now. %$* 512
okay, we can ping pong on this back and forth. %$* 510
david, you have one last shot at asking a question. %$* 510
the question i have for amy or sally, they can choose— %$* 516
come on, you’ve got to pick one. %$* 510
oh really? %$* 516
yeah. %$* 510
well let me— %$* 516
she can refer it to the other one. %$* 510
let me pick sally, because if i recall correctly, some of your affiliation is with a group that doesn't like all kinds of regulations that some of us do like. %$* 516
your think tank is not known for its pro- regulatory system. %$* 516
given that stance in most areas, let me just rattle off a couple of quick points— %$* 516
this has got to be in form— %$* 510
oh, it’s going to be quick— %$* 516
it’s like jeopardy, it’s in form of a question. %$* 510
it is. %$* 516
okay. %$* 510
given what we know about enron, given what we know about mortgage, works, given what we know, at least according to some, about the way hedge funds work, given these examples, what makes you confident that a regulatory system where everyone could enter the market could possibly work? %$* 516
everything we know about regulation suggests that this would be a disaster, and to move us to a regu-, to count on regulation as you do, as amy did earlier, you're out of your league. %$* 516
all right— %$* 510
well, first— %$* 512
amy or sally, whatever, which %$* 510
thank you for bringing up aei, because it’s actually a place where we have more intellectual freedom than most universities, which is why i can talk about a regulated system and don’t have to adhere to a classic free market form. %$* 512
now, the kind of system i have in mind, really is a straw man i think you guys keep setting up, we are not talking about a classic commercial free for all, or a free market, or an ebay system. %$* 512
we’re talking about a third party payer. %$* 512
for example, today you, ira, could decide to give a kidney. %$* 512
you’d be called a good samaritan donor, you would show up at new york med, and you would say, please give my organ to the next person on the list in this region, in this hospital, in the country. %$* 512
and they would do it. %$* 512
the only difference in a model that we’re thinking, or i'm thinking about, is where you go and give your organ, and your retirement account is wired forty thousand dollars, end of story. %$* 512
everything else is the same, the, the screening you go through, the same medical check up, everything. %$* 512
okay, we now have time for question and answers from the audience, and please make your way out to the microphone, or have the microphone meet you, or a meeting of minds some place in the middle of the aisle. %$* 510
go ahead, you can stop there and ask, go ahead. %$* 510
my name is— %$* 517
technology problem with the mic, is it working? %$* 510
thanks, my name is— %$* 517
we don’t hear you. %$* 510
can you hear me? %$* 517
all right, go ahead. %$* 510
well, my name is john fung, and i'm pleased to say i had no meeting with people on the panel. %$* 517
by disclosure, i was a transplant surgeon at the university of pittsburgh for twenty years, and now at the cleveland clinic. %$* 517
during my years at the cleveland clinic, at the university of pittsburgh i was fortunate to have been involved in the care of robert casey, who was then the governor of pennsylvania, having been part of the team that had performed a combined heart and liver transplant on him. %$* 517
and shortly after his transplant he met the family of the donor. %$* 517
his mother, the donor’s mother, relayed to governor casey at the time that the funeral expenses for her son couldn't, they couldn't come up with the money for it. %$* 517
and as it turns out, to maybe, perhaps the audience doesn't realize, is that, funeral directors charge an additional amount on top of the costs of the preparation for the body on the order of about three hundred dollars because of the donation process. %$* 517
and so governor casey at the time, along with some of the transplant procurement centers in the state, came up with act 102, which provided the opportunity for citizens of pennsylvania to donate a dollar as part of their annual tax— %$* 517
mr. %$* 510
fung, i'm going to have to ask you to get to your question— %$* 510
i'm sorry— %$* 517
i have other people waiting. %$* 510
so the question, all right, and anyway, the three hundred dollars that was assigned to be allowed to pay for these funeral expenses was never implemented, even though it was approved by the state legislature, and the reason was because we didn't, it was thought to be against the federal regulations, the national organ transplant act. %$* 517
one of the issues here is, we’re talking about pro and con, the fact is that we don't have any data whatsoever that says it can be done, or can't be done in the united states. %$* 517
we’re all referring to the middle east, or south america, whatever. %$* 517
so i think one of the comments for the pro side of this is, why not allow a pilot study? %$* 517
okay, let me get— %$* 510
the american medical association— %$* 517
okay! %$* 510
you made your point, thank you. %$* 510
any comments? %$* 510
why not allow, why not allow a pilot study to see how %$* 510
well there, again, i really want to draw the audience’s attention to the fact that the pennsylvania initiative that dr. %$* 516
fung was just alluding to didn't trouble a lot of folks. %$* 516
it was small, the amount of money was relatively trivial, although some wag in the new york times wrote everybody who’s dying is going to go to pennsylvania, which i thought was pretty absurd. %$* 516
not heaven, huh? %$* 510
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 510
i see, okay, i get it. %$* 510
look, in new york, you know, first prize is one day, second prize is two days in philadelphia, but that’s another story. %$* 516
we have to give them equal time now. %$* 510
this is true. %$* 516
but i can't emphasize enough that the excitement and the interest and the concern about this issue doesn't come from the, you know, the couple of hundred bucks in the cadaver world— %$* 516
david, i have to get to the question, and that was, why not give it a try? %$* 510
well i really don’t have great problems with giving pennsylvania a try, frank and jim may %$* 516
but that’s not what we’re debating tonight. %$* 516
okay, frank, what-- %$* 510
would you be willing to give something a try, or anything that they, some, some form of it? %$* 510
there’s a guy in taiwan, formosa plastics, a generous man, every time somebody dies whose family donates a kidney, he gives them several hundred dollars for burial expenses. %$* 516
this crowd wouldn't be here if we were debating three hundred bucks for burial expenses. %$* 516
i know, but he’s not, that was a long story, well told, but got the point— %$* 510
three hundred bucks for burial expenses. %$* 516
let me ask jim, what— %$* 510
first of all, i have no problem with that experiment, i wish it would have been implemented, it’s an expression of gratitude to the donors, that is very different from setting up an incentivized system— %$* 513
that’s right. %$* 516

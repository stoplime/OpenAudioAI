what happens when metadata goes as a result of the development of electronics from one instrumentality to another, even if you knew about it at one time, and you're a congressman, and you forgot about it because you're getting older and you forget stuff, doesn't change-- %$* 216
doesn't change-- %$* 216
not talking about anybody in this room. %$* 216
okay. %$* 216
change the fact that metadata is just metadata. %$* 216
all right. %$* 13
let me bring in daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
it's always dangerous when your opponent starts to compliment you. %$* 13
it's a very tricky move. %$* 13
but his point being, you had something to blow a whistle about. %$* 13
edward snowden does not. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
let me move on something else-- %$* 215
no, i-- %$* 13
before you do that, i'd like to hear your answer to that question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 215
i'm saying that he is saying that edward snowden did not have anything to blow a whistle on, you did, but snowden didn't. %$* 13
okay, most of the material that i put out in the pentagon papers, 4,000 pages that i gave to the newspapers, an additional 3,000 that i gave only to the senate foreign relations committee, it so happens, so there's some i didn't put out, it's very clear, by the way, that snowden had an enormous amount of information that he could have put out. %$* 215
he says, and hasn't been challenged, that he chose not to because he thought it was not in the public interest. %$* 215
and a lot of what he put out was for background to the press in looking at that, but he relied on their judgment as to what to put out. %$* 215
in terms of when you say there was a difference in my case, in the 4,000 or even the 7,000 pages, there was actually no evidence of clear cut domestic criminality or even international criminality. %$* 215
so if it was whistleblowing, and i would say it was, that's not a requirement. %$* 215
i thought it was reckless, deceptive, dangerous decision making, and i felt it was still going on. %$* 215
and, unfortunately, i did not have the documents to prove what i was saying at the time from oral testimony i got-- %$* 215
but the point-- %$* 13
to the point that james woolsey was making, he is saying that snowden-- %$* 13
that the snowden revelations don't reveal anything that suggested that a whistleblowing was needed. %$* 13
okay, right, let me address that. %$* 215
they revealed, of course, and it's the only way we know, that clapper, director of national intelligence, clapper, gave a false statement to - - we know it from snowden. %$* 215
now, i do not believe, as ben wizner says, that actually he meant to deceive congress. %$* 215
i don't believe he did deceive congress. %$* 215
i believe that he, unchallenged by congress, meant to deceive the public and did so effectively since congress didn't challenge it. %$* 215
i just read a very interesting piece of background here by mr. %$* 215
mccarthy which convinced me that sensenbrenner is speaking very questionably when he denies that he knew or that his act covered that. %$* 215
that's the problem. %$* 215
let me assume that sensenbrenner is not telling the truth on this. %$* 215
remind everyone who sensenbrenner is. %$* 13
i-- %$* 215
james sensenbrenner who calls himself the "architect of the patriot act," although, again, mr. %$* 215
mccarthy said that was quite misleading. %$* 215
the point here is that congress has been willing to deceive the public along with the nsa and the president regularly here, and that's the problem, that snowden revealed. %$* 215
and i want to make a specific point here that was raised earlier on this metadata. %$* 215
why are we talking only about metadata entirely here? %$* 215
first of all, there's a lot of text messages that are not metadata, 200 million a day, that get brought up. %$* 215
but what makes us believe that we were not listening on a different program-- %$* 215
i don't mean listening, i mean collecting recording for later retrieval-- %$* 215
all the content of the emails and all the content of the audio of the telephone? %$* 215
and the answer is the president and the others keep saying, "we don't do it." why should we believe them? %$* 215
why would you believe %$* 215
okay, let's take the question to the other side. %$* 13
andrew mccarthy, why should we believe them? %$* 13
because we now have a system where there is oversight by congress and oversight by the courts, and that has shown time and time again where they have either exceeded their authority or they have gone beyond what the legal is-- %$* 48
but how did we hear that? %$* 215
we heard it from snowden's documents that came out. %$* 215
no, what-- %$* 48
we saw opinions of the fisa court, the federal court had not been made public. %$* 215
yes, and-- %$* 48
right, and from the opinions of the fisa court, what we see is that there's a give and take between the fisa court and the executive branch which there never was before the 1970s where they actually have to narrow the requests that they make and actually have to go back to-- %$* 48
right. %$* 215
go back to their desks and rewrite the requests that they make. %$* 48
can actually say how many times, out of 13,000 requests for warrants, 11 had to be modified or refused. %$* 215
no, no, no, they modify at a very high percentage. %$* 48
oh, %$* 215
if you're talking about warrants that get turned down or warrants that have to be totally rewritten-- %$* 48
yeah, warrants that get turned down, turned down. %$* 215
sure. %$* 48
but as far as modification is concerned-- %$* 48
and, by the way, all this-- %$* 48
this argument about how the fisa court is a rubberstamp, remember the infamous wall before 9/11 where the right hand couldn't-- %$* 48
the left hand couldn't know what the right hand was doing in the justice department, the fbi? %$* 48
the fisa court, when the patriotic act got rid of the wall and the fisa court ultimately upheld that-- %$* 48
the fisa court of appeals upheld it, the fisa court itself, by judicial fiat, attempted to rebuild the wall. %$* 48
that's the activist rubberstamp court that wouldn't let-- %$* 48
in the post 9/11 atmosphere-- %$* 48
did not want to allow the justice department to proceed without the wall-- %$* 48
but did they-- %$* 215
let's bring ben wizner in, who has been %$* 13
did they succeed? %$* 215
no. %$* 48
they got overruled because the law didn't support what they were trying to do. %$* 48
the point is, though-- %$* 48
they are not %$* 215
they were rubber-stamped. %$* 48
a check in the balance? %$* 215
it didn't happen. %$* 215
ben wizner. %$* 13
ben-- %$* 13
what-- %$* 48
when you lose-- %$* 48
ben wizner-- %$* 13
just let me-- %$* 13
what-- %$* 48
no let me-- %$* 48
this is great. %$* 48
when-- %$* 48
when they win-- %$* 48
when they lose, you need-- %$* 48
what is it? %$* 48
the checks and balances are there. %$* 48
when the checks and balances aren't there, you need to have them there. %$* 48
and when we put them in there, when you lose, there were no check balances. %$* 48
clapper-- %$* 215
clapper made a full statement. %$* 215
we want the courts. %$* 48
we want the courts until we lose in the courts. %$* 48
and then we leak everything. %$* 48
ben wizner, did you-- %$* 13
ben, did you-- %$* 13
did you follow the point andrew just made? %$* 13
because i'd like you to respond to it, actually. %$* 13
the-- %$* 13
he's sort of saying you're kind of arguing it both ways. %$* 13
i might have lost it in the give and take a little bit, but i will say this, that one of the points that i made was precisely that the court that had approved this 15 times had exceeded its mandate. %$* 214
this is a court that quite properly was set up to hear warrant applications in secret. %$* 214
when you're seeking a warrant, you don't need an adversarial process. %$* 214
we don't want the person who we're conducting surveillance on to know that we've sought a warrant. %$* 214
what this court started to do over the last decade was to write long opinions-- %$* 214
30, 50, 80 pages long-- %$* 214
ruling on whether whole programs of surveillance were consistent with federal statutes and consistent with the constitution. %$* 214
they did that without the benefit of any adversary. %$* 214
they did that without anybody arguing the other side in front of these courts. %$* 214
many of these judges who have left the court have said they would have benefited from an adversary. %$* 214
and what's happened now that these same challenges are being brought in open federal courts? %$* 214
well, now there's a 50-50 response so far. %$* 214
one judge in new york said that he thought that the phone records program was legal. %$* 214
one judge in d.c., a republican judge, appointed by a republican president, said he thought the program was almost orwellian and a threat to democracy. %$* 214
okay. %$* 13
let's-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
i want to bring in james, because you made that point before, and see what his response is to that. %$* 13
from 1971 to '73, i was general council of the senate armed services committee. %$* 216
there was no intelligence committee at the time, so four congressional staffers from the senate and the house side-- %$* 216
and four senators-- %$* 216
did all of the oversight work with respect to the intelligence community-- %$* 216
everything-- %$* 216
the national reconnaissance office, nsa, cia, and the rest. %$* 216
i have seen-- %$* 216
either from in the executive branch or as a private citizen interested in these issues and following them-- %$* 216
the oversight personnel capabilities, numbers of offices, numbers of people involved in overseeing the american system of intelligence is truly awesome. %$* 216
there is no country anywhere in the world that has the massive oversight from legislative, judicial, and executive sides and functions over their intelligence systems-- %$* 216
nobody is even close to the united states. %$* 216
now, some of you may believe that we need more or we need to change what we've got because it isn't working right. %$* 216
all right. %$* 216
fine, you know, let's talk about it. %$* 216
sometimes you've got to keep fixing things. %$* 216
that's what our government is like. %$* 216
things don't work, you got to fix them. %$* 216
but the idea that across the board, we don't have enough oversight-- %$* 216
i think-- %$* 216
i wish some of you could have joined me back there in 1971. %$* 216
you said in your opening statement that edward snowden, having decided as an individual that he saw something wrong-- %$* 13
and your opponents disagree that what he saw was wrong enough to blow a whistle on. %$* 13
nevertheless, when he decided to blow a whistle-- %$* 13
that he had no other way, but ultimately to steal the material and go to the press. %$* 13
that's not the problem. %$* 18
wait, let daniel ellsberg respond to it. %$* 13
daniel. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
why did he have no other way? %$* 13
okay. %$* 215
fine. %$* 215
i'm glad to have a chance to address that. %$* 215
actually, the president and others-- %$* 215
many others-- %$* 215
have spoken about-- %$* 215
there was a better way, the way it was done was sensational, more heat than light. %$* 215
there were better ways to do that. %$* 215
i think that's clearly wrong. %$* 215
i really whether the president is so misinformed about the situation as actually to believe that. %$* 215
there were four nsa high officials-- %$* 215
senior officials-- %$* 215
i'll name them: kurt wiebe, ed loomis, bill binney, and thomas drake, who have among them an average of 30 years in the nsa-- %$* 215
one is 28, another is 32-- %$* 215
who left the nsa because it conflicted with their conscience eventually. %$* 215
they left it because it conflicted with the constitution. %$* 215
they had tested the proposition - - that is, there are other ways to do it-- %$* 215
in every possible way. %$* 215
they had complained to their superiors that the then warrantless surveillance that was going on since 9/11 was unconstitutional, was a violation of the fourth amendment. %$* 215
but what was the constitutional violation? %$* 48
the fourth amendment. %$* 215
oh, really? %$* 48
but, andrew, let him just finish. %$* 13
i want to stay to the point of whether he had another way. %$* 13
let me say-- %$* 215
let me say on that. %$* 215
let me go a little further. %$* 215
it wasn't just unconstitutional. %$* 215
the warrant with surveillance i think was blatantly illegal and criminal actually-- %$* 215
okay, but daniel-- %$* 13
daniel-- %$* 13
well, i'm sorry, i do need to say-- %$* 215
no, no, no. %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
whoa, whoa, whoa. %$* 13
just a minute. %$* 13
i just want you to complete your thought on why he had no other way. %$* 13
yeah, okay. %$* 215
and i want to hear from your opponents what the other way was. %$* 13
they did everything-- %$* 215
they went to their superiors, they went to the inspector generals and nsa and at the dib.they went to congressional staff and asked to testify. %$* 215
they asked to testify in open court under oath. %$* 215
they got nowhere. %$* 215
every one of them was subject wrongly to an fbi raid which took their computers without charging them ever with anything. %$* 215
thomas drake as a result, has got a spurious investigation and so forth. %$* 215
they have each said, in contrast-- %$* 215
without endorsing everything that snowden has said-- %$* 215
they have said the path he used was the only way to do what they had tried to do, was to bring this to the attention of congress and the public and that there was no other way to do it. %$* 215
all right. %$* 13
so the-- %$* 13
andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
so the supreme court says that metadata is not constitutionally protected, but four intelligence agents and you know that it is a fourth amendment violation. %$* 48
we were talking in 2001 to 2006 about metadata. %$* 215
they were collecting-- %$* 215
thomas drake-- %$* 215
it's the same information. %$* 48
thomas drake was saying at the time, within nsa, and has said since, they were collecting content. %$* 215
and he said it's a secret-- %$* 215
i'm not-- %$* 48
i'm not even going to get-- %$* 48
i'm not even going to get into-- %$* 48
andrew has the floor right now. %$* 13
i'm not even going to get into the fact that the metadata base-- %$* 48
we're not talking metadata. %$* 215
that we're-- %$* 48
i'm talking about meta-- %$* 48
i'm talking about metadata. %$* 48
i get to do that. %$* 48
the metadata base-- %$* 48
i can see why %$* 215
where they keep talking about how all your records are being collected, your name is not in it, your address is not in it. %$* 48
wait. %$* 13
hold it. %$* 13
hold it, hold it, hold it. %$* 13
i don't want us to be talking about metadata all night because there is an-- %$* 13
there is a debate to be held on whether the metadata itself represents a threat to privacy. %$* 13
and we can have that debate. %$* 13
we're trying to make a judgment about snowden's action. %$* 13
right. %$* 48
and i-- %$* 13
and the word "constitutional"-- %$* 48
and we've gone through the issue of whether you thought he was whistle blow worthy or not. %$* 13
you said no. %$* 13
i want to move on to this point of whether he had another way to - - if he had this conviction that something was wrong, what would he do internally? %$* 13
what's there for him? %$* 13
when your opponents are saying that there are four examples that they cited of other people who apparently he was watching who tried to do the same thing and got nowhere and that that therefore justifies what he did. %$* 13
what's your response to that? %$* 13
he could have gone to congress, which is the main place that he could have gone to. %$* 48
he could have gone to inspectors general in his own agency. %$* 48
i haven't heard any evidence that he actually tried to take any of these steps whatsoever. %$* 48
did he try, ben wizner? %$* 13
yeah, he did. %$* 214
he certainly has told barton gellman of the washington post that he did complain regularly internally. %$* 214
but it's interesting that you think he should have gone to the same congress that you say knew everything that he was going to report. %$* 214
congress did know. %$* 214
he was supposed to tell-- %$* 214
senator wydenwas on the floor of the senate with his hair on fire saying, "if only the public knew what i knew, they would be outraged, they would be furious." well, we didn't know because he didn't tell us. %$* 214
we only know it because edward snowden gave it to the press, and the press told us. %$* 214
now the rules are changing. %$* 214
when you say he did try, really, how hard did he try to go up the chain of command? %$* 13
well, and how effective could it have been? %$* 214
no, that's a different question. %$* 13
no, no. %$* 214
you're saying he didn't try because-- %$* 13
you're saying he didn't try because he didn't think it would work. %$* 13
no, i'm saying he did report his concerns to superiors. %$* 214
uh-huh. %$* 13
one time when he reported concerns to superiors in a posting in geneva, he was reprimanded and punished for it. %$* 214
this is the experience of people who complained in the intelligence community is that they either get ignored or they get crushed. %$* 214
i think that's nonsense. %$* 216
james woolsey. %$* 13
i have had an inspector general look into my management of the intelligence community and had disputes about it with him. %$* 216
i have seen a whole range of approaches of people inside intelligence organizations go up the chain through the processes that let them argue that they've not been well treated. %$* 216
these systems are not fanciful. %$* 216
they work most of the time. %$* 216
they're not perfect. %$* 216
but generally speaking, if you have an inspector general or you have a committee of the congress that has responsibilities, you are-- %$* 216
you live in a free country. %$* 216
you can-- %$* 216
you can go see people. %$* 216
you can make appointments. %$* 216
you can argue. %$* 216
you can compromise. %$* 216
it's the way we do things. %$* 216
but you can't, just forever add people and offices, otherwise you won't have anybody doing anything else. %$* 216
you already have so many people and so many structures preserving oversight over the intelligence community that the mind reels. %$* 216
daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
i can believe that ambassador woolsey is totally sincere in his description of that. %$* 215
of course, he's not speaking as a whistleblower, and i wonder how many whistleblowers experience-- %$* 215
actual whistleblowers he has actually spoken to. %$* 215
i have, a great many; the government accountability project and many others. %$* 215
the experience of going to igs is simply a way of being-- %$* 215
and to your superiors is a way of identifying yourself as a troublemaker who will be suspected of being a leaker if there is a leak. %$* 215
that's why the four nsa people who had not been a leak to the new york times-- %$* 215
which in my opinion, they should have been and certainly would have been more effective, that's why they were raided by the fbi and the computers, because they identified themselves as somebody who already thought the system was unconstitutional. %$* 215
ambassador woolsey, i thought by your own comment, if i understood you correctly-- %$* 215
and i'm interested that you work on senate armed services committee and were a senior staffer on that. %$* 215
but i thought i heard you say there were four staffers. %$* 215
there were-- %$* 215
which sounds about right. %$* 215
and there were some others. %$* 215
and the idea, of course, that we're talking about effective oversight is absolutely ludicrous. %$* 215
judges of the fisa court, several of them now, especially ones off and even some who are on, have said, what can we do to see whether any of our orders are implemented? %$* 215
we don't have technical experience. %$* 215
we don't have staff, we don't have budget. %$* 215
and essentially the same is true of these committees. %$* 215
and i want to make one last point here. %$* 215
russell tice-- %$* 215
well, first thomas drake has said-- %$* 215
the one i'm talking about-- %$* 215
has said the secret they're trying to hold onto desperately is to talk about metadata and not reveal how much content they are already recording. %$* 215
and russell tice has said, i, in the nsa, had phone records of justice alito, of journalists' sources, of congress people, including feinstein and her staff and a great deal of content. %$* 215
now, maybe he's wrong-- %$* 215
maybe he's wrong, but he has asked to testify under oath to congress. %$* 215
and not one committee has asked one of them to testify because they don't want to know. %$* 215
james woolsey, and then i want to move on. %$* 13
i was emphasizing-- %$* 216
and you should have. %$* 215
i was emphasizing how much the oversight machinery of the congress has grown since 1971. %$* 216
up to four. %$* 215
that's pretty good. %$* 215
it has stunningly grown. %$* 216
that whole wing of the capitol these days, i get the feeling if you walk into it, you know, it may sink into the ground there are so many people's offices in it. %$* 216
the oversight machinery of the congress and of-- %$* 216
i think of the executive branch is quite extensive. %$* 216
it may need some reforms. %$* 216
if so, fine. %$* 216
let's talk about it. %$* 216
if it has to be classified, talk about it in a classified forum. %$* 216
figure out what changes need to be made and make them. %$* 216
that's the way we do things in the-- %$* 216
i want to hear audience questions now. %$* 13
and i ask you to bring up questions that keep us on this topic of snowden's actions, his motivations, the consequences of what he's done and whether they justify what he did. %$* 13
we haven't even talked yet about the against side's argument that he caused enormous harm to key government programs that are protecting all of us, and somebody might want to bring that up. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, i'll call you-- %$* 13
call on you. %$* 13
if-- %$* 13
a microphone will you brought to you. %$* 13
if you stand up and give your name, we'd appreciate it. %$* 13
hold the microphone about the distance from your mouth that i have with this microphone so that we can hear you on the radio broadcasts. %$* 13
ask a tight, focused question that's on this topic. %$* 13
sir right down here. %$* 13
mic's coming down from behind you. %$* 13
could you stand up, please? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
avi spindel my question concerns, was it necessary for snowden to divulge the amount of information that he did and still create the process that he was seeking? %$* 18
ben wizner. %$* 13
well, that gives us another opportunity to clarify and to respond to one of andy mccarthy's points. %$* 214
but you are going to answer his question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 214
the number of documents that snowden has disclosed is zero. %$* 214
snowden provided a great deal of material to journalists. %$* 214
he entrusted it to journalists, at the guardian, at the washington post. %$* 214
it's since expanded to the new york times and other newspapers. %$* 214
his instructions to those reporters were that they, in consultation with their own editors, using their own judgment of what was in the public interest, and in consultation with the united states government, should publish what the public ought to know and should withhold what the public should not know. %$* 214
my view is that the reporting until now has been extremely responsible. %$* 214
there has not been an article published that didn't give at least the government a chance to weigh in. %$* 214
there have been redactions-- %$* 214
but then why should-- %$* 13
why should critics of snowden feel better about that? %$* 13
why should that make them feel better? %$* 13
i mean, this is %$* 214
are you saying-- %$* 48
that disclosing to greenwald is not disclosing? %$* 48
no. %$* 214
what i'm saying is there is a difference and a long tradition of having journalists compete with the security state over what should be secret and what should be public. %$* 214
if you look at the last decade, what we would not have known without leaks and investigative journalists, we wouldn't have known about torture at abu ghraib, we wouldn't have known that the cia had set up a network of secret prisons across europe and the middle east, we wouldn't have known that the nsa had engaged in warrantless wiretapping before this was legalized by congress in 2008. %$* 214
all of this we know because journalists engage in competition with government for what the public ought to know and what it shouldn't know. %$* 214
now, what snowden did was on a larger scale. %$* 214
he gave a large amount of information to journalists, and those journalists include journalists around the world. %$* 214
i think part of what he wanted us to understand is that this is not about demonizing the nsa. the threat of mass dragnet surveillance, of collecting information about all of us in case one of us comes under suspicion, is a threat to all free society. %$* 214
but, sir, was your question couldn't he have done the same thing with fewer documents, with the-- %$* 13
yes-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
could he have not done more of the same thing with fewer documents? %$* 13
we don't know the answer yet. %$* 214
we don't know what has still to be published. %$* 214
and it's possible that the most important revelation that snowden provided to journalists has not yet been published. %$* 214
do i think that the reporting so far has been in the public interest? %$* 214
i think so, profoundly. %$* 214
jim woolsey, do you want to respond to that? %$* 13
yes. %$* 216
snowden has released in some fashion-- %$* 216
maybe he doesn't consider giving to newspaper reporters and letting them hold onto it for a while a release-- %$* 216
but, nonetheless, he's released, according to the press-- %$* 216
1.7-- %$* 216
no, no-- %$* 214
million-- %$* 216
according to national security officials, not according to the press. %$* 214
the press, quoting unnamed national security officials, quoting classified reports, that information is as false as their testimony was to congress-- %$* 214
ah, we can-- %$* 216
we can track back through that, if you want, but i think the key issue is what has he provided to the outside world that gets at the end of this chain of press to the non- press, whatever, gets put in places where people can publicly read it? %$* 216
i gave you four examples of four major american programs that were extremely useful, and the blog material indicates that this is material that was disclosed as a result of snowden's efforts and operations, and we lost all four of those programs. %$* 216
and we will lose a lot more. %$* 216
so does that concern this side? %$* 13
daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 215
the statement that nsa has lost those programs is as reliable as the statement by nsa that he's released 1.7 million documents. %$* 215
snowden has said publicly and to me it so happens on encrypted line that, that's an absurd estimate and has no relation to the much, much, much lower amount that he released in terms of this. %$* 215
and the reason that does make a difference is that obviously 1.7 or one million or five-- %$* 215
half a million-- %$* 215
can't be read by him. %$* 215
he learned from manning to avoid the charge that he was releasing anything he had not read himself. %$* 215
why-- %$* 13
daniel, why do you say-- %$* 13
i think the word was "absurd," the statement you said jim woolsey made, that four important programs had been lost, why is that an absurd statement? %$* 13
no, no, no, it's not absurd. %$* 215
maybe it happened. %$* 215
but to take at face value the statement that nsa has not been able to replace that, that it doesn't have substitutes, that it got-- %$* 215
that it actually caused them harm %$* 215
some of those programs are not nsa programs, they're military programs. %$* 216
fine, that's also part-- %$* 215
that's part of it. %$* 215
the programs of other foreign intelligence services. %$* 18
what i'm saying is that this sort of thing can't be decided by you or me or by the press, it has to be decided by intelligence committees in a court that have an entirely different technical capability and backup and access-- %$* 215
technical access to nsa programs that does not exist now. %$* 215
and i've been trying to give one specific example of that, when russell tice has said numerous times and in public that he had evidence, personal knowledge, of targeting of every member of the armed service committee, every member of the intelligence committee, including feinstein, her staff, and home, prepared to testify that under oath-- %$* 215
when he said that he wanted to testify, nsa immediately sent him a letter, which i've seen, saying, "you are-- %$* 215
" this is to the armed services committee, your old committee-- %$* 215
and he said, "i want to testify to armed services." and they said, "we remind you of your oath under nsa, the armed services committee-- %$* 215
" and they didn't distinguish between staff and members-- %$* 215
"the armed services committee is not cleared for that information."what? %$* 215
this is-- %$* 215
go to another question. %$* 13
this is oversight? %$* 215
this is an absolutely broken system. %$* 215
sir, right down here. %$* 13
if anybody's a member of the press, we'd appreciate it if you could identify yourself as well. %$* 13
isn't this off the record? %$* 215
nothing is off the record-- %$* 13
ever. %$* 13
hey, dan, i thought it was code word. %$* 216
sir? %$* 13
does it disturb you-- %$* 18
can you tell us your name? %$* 13
herb london. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 18
does it disturb you that some of the revelations that came out when mr. %$* 18
snowden was in china and russia may very well have jeopardized intelligence officers operating clandestinely across the world? %$* 18
and your answer can't be, "we don't know if it has," because the question is-- %$* 13
it may well have. %$* 13
it's very plausible-- %$* 13
well, if-- %$* 18
but i've heard the answer from you guys a few times, and well, who knows? %$* 13
but-- %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
no, i have-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
well, the answer i've heard-- %$* 215
and it's a question of who you believe on this-- %$* 215
is that snowden said that he had actually the knowledge of practically every clandestine office of nsa in the world, not only the knowledge, but he-- %$* 215
i mean, he hadn't just seen it, but he had the knowledge. %$* 215
he said he had no intention of releasing that or taking it with him to china or anywhere else that he took the classified information, because that would not be in the public interest. %$* 215
now, should we believe him? %$* 215
well, some say, "no, it's all given to china." first of all, i trust his judgment as to what the public ought to know or not know about nsa more than i trust the judgment of anybody who said, "none of this should be known to the public." i don't think their judgment is to be trusted at all. %$* 215
and i do trust-- %$* 215
subject to analysis. %$* 215
it's the congress and the courts, and it's the four people in nsa-- %$* 215
plus tice-- %$* 215
have all said it is essential that there be a group of technies, nerds, hacker types who have the technical knowledge, reporting with full access to nsa data, reporting to congress and to the judiciary, and that's the only way we will get this system under constitutional control. %$* 215
does anyone have a question that will be directed to this side? %$* 13
and are there any women here who would like to ask a question? %$* 13
i'm trying to balance a bit, but i need you to put your hands up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
now it has to be a really great question, of course. %$* 13
do you mind standing up? %$* 13
of course. %$* 217
thank you. %$* 13
shannon wilkinson. %$* 217
how could snowden have approached congress? %$* 217
i mean, specifically, if someone in his position wanted to have approached congress before going public, how would he do that? %$* 217
how could he have? %$* 217
all right. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
picked up the telephone and called staff director of the intelligence committee, and say, "i have a very sensitive matter that i need to discuss with you-- %$* 216
–i want to make an appointment with you." %$* 216
and jim-- %$* 13
for those of us who don't know, that is a realistic scenario. %$* 13
they would take the call. %$* 13
they would take it seriously? %$* 13
yes. %$* 216
i mean, it-- %$* 216
congress does its sometimes rather clumsy best to be responsible to be voters. %$* 216
and i think that-- %$* 216
as a member of the executive branch and a position of importance, if you wanted to talk to somebody senior on the hill, a staffer-- %$* 216
probably initially-- %$* 216
and then to perhaps a member-- %$* 216
i don't think there are huge barriers to that. %$* 216
there may be with individuals who don't want to be bothered or shouldn't have that job because they're not any good at it-- %$* 216
somebody else ought to have it. %$* 216
that happens. %$* 216
but you-- %$* 13
but you've heard from your opponents tonight a fair litany of specific examples that they cite-- %$* 13
none of us can vouch for their veracity, but we think everybody comes here in good faith-- %$* 13
telling the stories of people who've tried that and gotten nowhere. %$* 13
so, what about-- %$* 13
well, that can-- %$* 216
those-- %$* 13
that can happen. %$* 216

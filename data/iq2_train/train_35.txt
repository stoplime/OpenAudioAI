and, as always, we start these debates by bringing on the person who brought intelligence squared u.s.to the new york stage. %$* 13
he frames the evening for us, talks about why we’re doing this debate, why it matters, and a little bit of what we’re likely to see. %$* 13
so let’s now please welcome to the stage, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
so, bob, this one-- %$* 13
we do one of these a month, at least once a month-- %$* 13
this one sold out faster than any that we've ever put up, and we know that there have been people calling for the last several days begging for tickets. %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
what's going on with this topic? %$* 13
why this one? %$* 13
well, this debate, first of all, touches such an emotional hot button. %$* 1
i mean, people's reaction to snowden are really extreme in either direction, and they feel very committed to their views. %$* 1
but the other thing that's pretty extraordinary is we have tonight the most famous whistleblower of all time, dan ellsberg, who was a colleague of mine at the rand corporation many, many years ago and jim woolsey, who's a former director of the cia, so you couldn't have more expert people on-- %$* 1
passionately committed to opposite sides of this motion. %$* 1
and we have debated this-- %$* 13
this delicate balance that everyone is struggling to reach between security and privacy. %$* 13
we've-- %$* 13
we debated a few months ago, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe." but how is this one different from that? %$* 13
well, "spy on me, i'd rather be safe" was, as you say, this dichotomy or tension between privacy and security. %$* 1
and in these debates-- %$* 1
and that's a theme that's recurred in a number of debates we've done-- %$* 1
the privacy side seems to win. %$* 1
the security side doesn't. %$* 1
and my theory about that is that ordinary people have one and only one contact with domestic surveillance. %$* 1
that's airport security, and it strikes them as a joke, and, the clowns that brought them that joke, they don't want to see have anymore power. %$* 1
so then when snowden comes along and reveals that there is every single phone call that every american has ever made is-- %$* 1
is saved and recorded-- %$* 1
not recorded, but the record of the call having been made is saved-- %$* 1
that's a degree of surveillance that, frankly, congressmen had no idea was going on, no less ordinary americans. %$* 1
and it created a really shocking reaction. %$* 1
so i think that the fact that snowden opened up a debate on this very sensitive topic and brought information to the debate that hadn't been there before is why some people at least feel like he is justified. %$* 1
and then when you get the phenomenon of-- %$* 1
at least a couple of judges at this point have questioned whether the nsa surveillance is authorized or even whether it's constitutional, you know, the step would be to say, well, okay, he was a whistleblower, he called attention to something that needed attention, and while he may have been doing something illegal, from a moral point of view, it was justified. %$* 1
so you're making-- %$* 13
that would be the argument that it's justified. %$* 13
what's the shape of the argument that he is not justified? %$* 13
well, the argument in the other direction is that he was far more than a whistleblower. %$* 1
he tried to subvert or at least did subvert the very mission of the nsa.i mean, their job is to keep track of our enemies to see what's going on in iran and in russia and with al- qaeda and so on, or with our adversaries like china. %$* 1
and he undermined their ability to do that job in a very serious way. %$* 1
he revealed which codes they had broken. %$* 1
he revealed what methods they use. %$* 1
he revealed what firewalls had been breached. %$* 1
he revealed which computers had been hacked into, which individuals had been targeted. %$* 1
i mean, this was a serious setback for national security. %$* 1
and he didn't just do this. %$* 1
i mean, this was a very deliberate thing. %$* 1
he took the job with the intention of stealing secrets and disseminating them, held a job for three months. %$* 1
and when he did what he set out to do, he flees to china and then russia, takes with him four laptops full of secret information, which you have to presume that both the chinese and the russians now have. %$* 1
i mean, this is espionage of the most serious sort. %$* 1
and it's not justified, you know. %$* 13
well, and the argument would be that he should be punished to the full extent of the law. %$* 1
we're going to hear all of those arguments brought to today-- %$* 13
to the stage tonight and in more detail. %$* 13
but let's now welcome our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
you. %$* 13
and you're doing very well at the applause, without any visual indicators, so thank you for that. %$* 13
but i would like to ask for one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz, our chairman. %$* 13
promises, as the saying goes, are made to be broken. %$* 13
but taking an oath, that is meant to be solemn. %$* 13
oaths are meant to be kept. %$* 13
and the young man who spilled the secrets about the nsa, taking in all of that stuff about all of our phone calls here in this hall, edward snowden, he took an oath, and it went like this, to, "support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic." so when snowden broke secrecy, did he break his oath, given that those secrets have now, in all likelihood, reached our enemies? %$* 13
or did he uphold his oath? %$* 13
because what he exposed in those programs arguably fights the constitution itself. %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a great debate, so let's have it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: "snowden was justified," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we're here at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: “snowden was justified.”as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is "snowden is justified." and let's meet one of the first debaters here to argue in support of this motion. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome ben wizner. %$* 13
and, ben, you are the director of the aclu speech, privacy & technology project. %$* 13
you have litigated numerous cases involving civil liberties abuses post-9/11.you are also personally a legal adviser to edward snowden. %$* 13
and, ben, we understand the two of you are in regular contact over encrypted channels. %$* 13
not long ago you were in russia visiting him. %$* 13
and so just out of curiosity, does he know that you're actually doing this debate? %$* 13
he does know. %$* 214
he has been following the global debate very closely, and he's aware of this debate tonight. %$* 214
is he watching this debate tonight? %$* 13
well, you know, there's a nine-hour time difference, but he's a night owl, so i would put the chances at about 50/50. %$* 214
alright. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ben wizner. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and ben-- %$* 13
ben, would you introduce your partner? %$* 13
i am joined tonight by a genuine american hero. %$* 214
pentagon papers whistleblower, daniel ellsberg. %$* 214
ladies and gentlemen, daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
daniel ellsberg, you were once called "the most dangerous man in america," by henry kissinger. %$* 13
and in 1971, you leaked the pentagon papers, 7,000-page top-secret study that detailed government secrecy and deception during the vietnam war. %$* 13
newspapers published it. %$* 13
it came out as a book. %$* 13
but the-- %$* 13
but the papers themselves were only officially declassified and released by the federal government in 2011, 40 years after the fact. %$* 13
what do you make of that, daniel ellsberg? %$* 13
well, it's a pretty good demonstration of the absurdity of the classification system. %$* 215
probably 98 percent of what is now classified-- %$* 215
and we're talking about billions of pages here, that is more than two or three years old, should not still bear a classification-- %$* 215
alright. %$* 13
or let's say five years old. %$* 215
so-- %$* 13
so they’re keeping it for 40 years is typical. %$* 215
so we're getting a little bit of a look ahead of what your arguments are going to be. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
our motion is this: “snowden was justified.” and here to argue against the motion, we have two debaters. %$* 13
first, please, let's welcome andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
and andrew, you are a former chief assistant u.s.attorney who led the prosecution against the “blind sheik,” omar abdel rahman, and 11 others for the 1993 world trade center bombing. %$* 13
this is your second time actually debating with us. %$* 13
the first time was almost seven years ago in our inaugural season. %$* 13
you got us off to a great start. %$* 13
the motion that night was "better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11."and maybe we don't have to ask, but what side were you on that time? %$* 13
believe it or not, i was on the "better more surveillance" side. %$* 48
and-- %$* 48
how do you-- %$* 13
we’re on the upper west side, they were on the "better another 9/11" side, so-- %$* 48
how'd you do? %$* 13
well, i had a great time. %$* 48
i'm not going to push on that one. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
and, andrew, your debating partner is? %$* 13
my debating partner is a great american patriot, the former cia director, jim woolsey. %$* 48
ladies and gentlemen, james woolsey. %$* 13
james, you are also arguing against this motion, "snowden was justified." you were cia director from 1993 to 1995. you served on five different occasions under both republican and democratic administrations. %$* 13
your life post-government has included working on security and alternative energy issues. %$* 13
and you're currently chairman of the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 13
but here is an interesting thing that we dug up: two years ago, in 2012, in a theatrical workshop experimental presentation of a musical comedy, you actually played a cia director. %$* 13
and you sang, i'm not sure whether you danced, but could you tell everyone what your - - what was the name of the cia director you played? %$* 13
heinous overreach. %$* 216
which tells us, if nothing else, you have a sense of humor. %$* 13
thank you, james woolsey. %$* 13
so those are our debaters. %$* 13
and, as we have said, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
only one side will win. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here in new york city, will choose the winner by your vote. %$* 13
we have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to the preliminary vote if you go to those keypads at your seat. %$* 13
the motion is this, "snowden was justified." right now that is motion number one. %$* 13
you push number one if you agree with that motion. %$* 13
if you disagree that "snowden was justified," you push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, you push number three. %$* 13
and we'll lock out the system in about 10 seconds. %$* 13
if you made a mistake just correct your vote and it'll lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and remember, again, at the end of the debate we have you vote a second time. %$* 13
the turnaround time on the results is about a minute and a half. %$* 13
and we draw the comparison between the opening and the closing votes. %$* 13
that's how we determine our winner, the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms. %$* 13
so on to round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater speaking in turn, uninterrupted. %$* 13
those will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is this, "snowden was justified." and here to speak first in support of this motion, ben wizner. %$* 13
he is legal adviser to edward snowden, and he is the director of the american civil liberties union speech, privacy & technology project. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome ben wizner. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 214
it's a great honor to be able to share a table with a man i've admired all my life, in support of a man who i've come to admire tremendously over the last eight months. %$* 214
on june 7th of last year, following the publication of the first nsa stories in the washington post and the guardian, but before edward snowden had revealed his identity to us, president obama addressed the revelations. %$* 214
and he said, "i welcome this debate, and i think it is healthy for our democracy."the president was right. %$* 214
this debate has been healthy for our democracy and for democracies around the world. %$* 214
in fact, it's the extraordinary global debate that edward snowden launched-- %$* 214
a debate about the threat that mass surveillance poses to free societies, about how surveillance technologies have outpaced democratic controls, about whether the internet will be an instrument of democratic liberation or authoritarian control-- %$* 214
that provides the best answer to tonight's debate. %$* 214
edward snowden is justified because he provided to journalists and through them to us information that we had a right to know and that we had a need to know. %$* 214
the government had not just concealed this information, it had lied to us about it. %$* 214
and the debate that we've had and that we're still having would not have happened any other way. %$* 214
now, in those same june 7th remarks, president obama also defended the government's surveillance practices. %$* 214
he said that those practices had been blessed and approved by all three branches of government: within the executive branch, by the courts, and by the congress. %$* 214
now, in making that point, president obama probably would have said that he was joining our opponents' table. %$* 214
i would respectfully submit that exactly the opposite is true. %$* 214
and why do i say that? %$* 214
i say it because the same oversight bodies that had blessed these activities in the dark have dramatically challenged them and changed course in the light. %$* 214
now, all three branches of government are engaged in a historic reevaluation of the nsa's surveillance practices. %$* 214
and we're virtually certain to see the first new limits on intelligence surveillance since the 1970s. %$* 214
what a difference an informed public can make. %$* 214
in short, our traditional democratic oversight mechanisms failed miserably before snowden's revelations. %$* 214
now, they're doing their jobs. %$* 214
let's begin with congress. %$* 214
when the guardian revealed that the nsa had been-- %$* 214
collected the phone records of every american on a daily basis, many members of congress expressed shock-- %$* 214
even though that program was purportedly authorized by section 215 of the patriot act. %$* 214
now, there's been a lot of debate since then about whether congress did or did not know, or what they knew or did not know. %$* 214
but does it really matter? %$* 214
either way, this was a colossal failure of oversight. %$* 214
either they knew and did nothing, or they didn't know what the nsa was doing in collecting all the americans' information on a daily basis. %$* 214
now, we're all familiar with congress's most dramatic oversight failure. %$* 214
and this was in the notorious exchange between senator ron wyden and director of national intelligence james clapper. %$* 214
wyden had asked, did the nsa collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of americans? %$* 214
clapper's answer was, "no, sir." now, this brazen falsehood is most often described as clapper's lie to congress, but that's not what it was. %$* 214
wyden knew that clapper was lying. %$* 214
only we didn't know. %$* 214
and congress lacked the courage to correct the record-- %$* 214
allowed us to be deceived by the director of national intelligence. %$* 214
to me, that is the very definition of failed oversight. %$* 214
and edward snowden was watching. %$* 214
now, what about our courts? %$* 214
the court that had blessed the nsa's mass surveillance of americans is a specialized court that meets in secret and hears only from the government. %$* 214
it was designed to grant warrants for foreign intelligence collection. %$* 214
it makes sense that such a court would hear only from the government. %$* 214
over the last decade, it expanded its role to rule on the legality and constitutionality of programmatic surveillance. %$* 214
judicial review of those programs amounted to a secret court upholding secret programs by secretly reinterpreting american-- %$* 214
federal laws. %$* 214
now, when groups like the aclu tried to challenge the nsa's activities in open federal courts, an interesting thing happened. %$* 214
the government didn't say to those courts that the programs were illegal. %$* 214
the government said that we had no right to be in court. %$* 214
and the courts exceeded to that demand. %$* 214
the government's argument was, we couldn't prove that we had been surveilled. %$* 214
therefore, we had no standing to even raise these challenges. %$* 214
and in a 5 to 4 decision last year, the supreme court accepted that rationale and dismissed the case without even considering the legality of these programs. %$* 214
edward snowden was watching that too. %$* 214
now, when critics say that edward snowden should have gone through the system, that's the system they're talking about. %$* 214
courts and a congress that had abdicated their constitutional oversight role. %$* 214
now, what's happened since edward snowden's act of conscience-- %$* 214
since he brought the public into this discussion? %$* 214
well, two federal judges have now considered whether the nsa's mass collection of americans' phone data is legal. %$* 214
one said it's almost certainly unconstitutional, almost orwellian. %$* 214
another disagreed, but the key point is that both of these judges heard the challenge. %$* 214
they both agreed that we had standing to challenge the program, which was a remarkable development in itself. %$* 214
finally, these courts are doing their job and more challenges are on the way. %$* 214
what about congress? %$* 214
a newly energized congress has held dozens of oversight hearings-- %$* 214
public ones-- %$* 214
and is considering sweeping intelligence reforms that we haven't seen in nearly half a century-- %$* 214
to end bulk collection of americans' phone records, to reform that secret fisa court so that it doesn't only hear from the government and others. %$* 214
even the executive branch has undergone an extraordinary reevaluation of these programs. %$* 214
an nsa review panel appointed by the president-- %$* 214
which included very, very senior former intelligence officials-- %$* 214
the number two at the cia-- %$* 214
concluded that the nsa had allowed its technological capabilities to dictate its surveillance practices, rather than ensuring that its practices conform to our laws and values. %$* 214
none of this would have happened without edward snowden. %$* 214
for that reason alone, he was justified. %$* 214
thank you. %$* 13
ben wizner. %$* 13
and that's our motion – “snowden was justified.” and now here to speak against this motion, i'd like to bring to the lectern james woolsey. %$* 13
he is chairman of the foundation for defense of democracies and a former director of the central intelligence agency. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome james woolsey. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 216
i was honored to be asked to be here tonight, with this distinguished group. %$* 216
but, to tell you the truth, since i spent 22 years as a washington lawyer, and then some time out at the cia in the clinton administration, i'm actually honored to be invited into any polite company for any purpose at all. %$* 216
i am going to be relying on the blog, the lawfare blog, which publishes material usually a few days after it's released to press, and much of the snowden material has come into the public media in that way. %$* 216
a couple of introductory points: once you release material that had been classified or restricted for any other contractual or any other reason, you release it to the world. %$* 216
mr. %$* 216
snowden pledged to protect the constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, but he didn't do that. %$* 216
what he did was release-- %$* 216
steal and release-- %$* 216
material that went to, among others, hezbollah, al-qaeda, hamas, pyongyang, tehran and so on. %$* 216
in the real world, you can't have a principle that it is really important to release material, but you're only going to release it to nice people; you're not going to let terrorists and dictators peruse it and use it. %$* 216
but that's what they do, and that's what they are doing, because mr. %$* 216
snowden decided to let them do that. %$* 216
also, it is important, i think, that what mr. %$* 216
snowden did must be viewed in the context of an overall approach toward dealing with these tremendous issues of privacy versus security. %$* 216
he looked at this question, apparently, from the point of view of one who can pick and choose those portions of an obligation that he wants to maintain. %$* 216
he did not stay with the proposition that he had to fulfill his obligation to the united states across the board. %$* 216
he ignored some duties and did not ignore others. %$* 216
but he did not fulfill his obligations overall. %$* 216
what are the consequences of this? %$* 216
i'm going to mention five cases that have come to light from snowden materials and printed in the blogs, about what the consequences are of dealing with international relations in this way, and forcing your country to do it by the leaks that you have sponsored or undertaken. %$* 216
for example, china is the bad boy of cyber attacks. %$* 216
throughout the world, chinese cyber attacks-- %$* 216
theft of information and material, malware, on and on-- %$* 216
are a nuisance at best and a potential tragedy at worst to a huge range of countries and individuals. %$* 216
we had figured out a way, pre-snowden-- %$* 216
the united states government had-- %$* 216
to essentially have a bit of a jiu-jitsu operation against the chinese and to create a possibility whereby we could take their malware in a cyber world and send it back to them after make some adjustments and create problems for them rather than they creating problems for us. %$* 216
it's a clever operation. %$* 216
mr. %$* 216
snowden, of course, ended it by explicitly turning loose material that dealt with it precisely. %$* 216
we have an organization in the middle east-- %$* 216
the islamic state of iraq-- %$* 216
a terrorist organization of the worst kind. %$* 216
pre-snowden, we were reading not only their emails, but their preparation, their early- stage drafts of emails. %$* 216
had we been reading fully the emails of al-qaeda before 9/11, we might well have saved thousands of lives. %$* 216
but here, our ability to read isi's emails has been now obliterated by having been made public to the terrorist group itself. %$* 216
in the defense department, working together with the intelligence community, it has come to be possible to utilize cell phones, and their operation, with some very clever software in such a way that you can help an individual member of the military or an individual cia operations officer know whether he or she is being followed or not. %$* 216
a very clever system, one that saves people's lives. %$* 216
that also is no longer with us because snowden betrayed it, and it's now known to our adversaries. %$* 216
in latin america, we have come to find how to penetrate the communication networks of some of the worst organizations and groups that are selling women, principally women, into sexual slavery. %$* 216
we had a very good handle on how that was being done, working with other latin american countries in dealing with it. %$* 216
and that trafficking, that human trafficking network and our knowledge of their capabilities is, of course, now gone, with snowden having released that to those who are enslaving women in that part of the world. %$* 216
thank you. %$* 216
james woolsey, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 216
thank you very much. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion: “snowden was justified.” you've heard the first two opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
debating for the motion, "snowden was justified," daniel ellsberg, a former u.s.military analyst and the pentagon papers whistleblower. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 215
yes, i believe that edward snowden was fully justified in what he did. %$* 215
that does not cause me to support or make a judgment on any particular thing which has not yet been released or which has been released, exactly, but a question of whether he has served the public interest, on balance, in a way that could not have happened otherwise. %$* 215
i don't know the details that ambassador, former dci, james woolsey, has told about. %$* 215
and i'm not sure how you know, actually, unless you are privy in a way that has not been announced here. %$* 215
i do know what has been released by the papers so far. %$* 215
snowden, of course, has not released a single page by himself. %$* 215
he has explicitly said, over and over, that his own-- %$* 215
he doesn't trust his own bias in terms of transparency here. %$* 215
he wanted a judgment to be made of public interest by journalists that he trusted, and i think with right. %$* 215
and that is what has come out so far. %$* 215
i think that he was justified to the same degree, and in the same way, that i believe i was justified in releasing 4,000 or 7,000 pages of top secret documents 40 years ago, the pentagon papers. %$* 215
i believe that i had been mistaken earlier to keep silent about what i knew to be lies by my president, lyndon johnson, and later the president richard nixon, for whom i'd also worked, about what they were doing, what was happening, what the costs were, what the prospects were in vietnam. %$* 215
i was concerned at that moment not so much about the constitution, which had clearly been violated in terms of lying us into that war, but i was concerned at the people who were dying on both sides wrongly, i thought, by our escalations and by those lies. %$* 215
i'm saying that snowden, i believe, did what needed to be done, what the public needed to know. %$* 215
i think there was no other way-- %$* 215
no better way and almost no other way-- %$* 215
for that information to get out; that it was worth, as he said, taking the utmost risks to his freedom and even his life. %$* 215
and, of course, we've heard exaltations, actually, by mike rogers of the house intelligence committee, the homeland security committee, that he should be extralegally assassinated. %$* 215
others have suggested by due process of law-- %$* 215
i give ambassador woolsey credit for talking about the need for due process here. %$* 215
but the fact is had i believed the motives that were described by the people, you know, at the beginning of the supposed opposition to snowden, and we haven't heard that precisely from these two people yet, but-- %$* 215
or at all-- %$* 215
but if i'd believed that he had done this for some other country, for russia, for china, to their benefit and-- %$* 215
or even to major benefit to them, outweighing any benefit to the public interest-- %$* 215
i would not be supporting him now. %$* 215
i believe firmly that edward snowden is no more a traitor than i am or that i was. %$* 215
and i'm not. %$* 215
i was called that by the president and the vice president at the time, 40 years ago-- %$* 215
43 years ago. %$* 215
many-- %$* 215
i was called every name that has been called, virtually, to edward snowden or for that matter to chelsea manning earlier. %$* 215
in terms of blood on hands, as to what would be the benefit-- %$* 215
the cost of this, none of that came out in my case, which is, i think, why i'm seen somewhat differently now, 40 years later. %$* 215
nothing in chelsea manning's trial actually came out to justify the statement that people had died as a result of his revelations, and i think you should take with more than a grain of salt the descriptions right now that much worse will happen from edward snowden, revelations. %$* 215
the fact is that, i think, what he revealed was not just what nsa was doing, which i will make a premise-- %$* 215
i will stipulate-- %$* 215
was essentially with the knowledge of the president, at the orders of the president, desire of the president, and the knowledge of key figures in congress. %$* 215
but, as ben wizner made the point, that to me reveals his greatest revelation, which is that the reforms that came in after earlier revelations of abuses by the fbi, cia, nsa, and army intelligence, 40 years ago and 35 years ago, that led to the church committee and the current reforms, like the fisa court and the intelligence committees, i think what snowden has revealed is that those reforms, which were very necessary, failed. %$* 215
and they need to be not only redone, but better reforms are necessary, and i hope very much will result from what snowden has revealed. %$* 215
as a matter of fact, i'll have mentioned already that ambassador woolsey has said that he thought there should be due process, there should be a trial for treason-- %$* 215
that's something i'd argue with-- %$* 215
which implies that he thinks that snowden adhered to an enemy of the united states-- %$* 215
that's the definition in the constitution, which i know he knows. %$* 215
i certainly disagree with him on that, and i think there's-- %$* 215
that's absolutely wrong. %$* 215
but he believes then as a result he should get the maximum penalty for that, which is to be hanged by the neck till he is dead. %$* 215
now, actually one american was hanged by the neck for giving secrets to americans. %$* 215
actually, he was the first american to be charged with giving secrets to americans. %$* 215
i was the second, 200 years later. %$* 215
his name was nathan hale, and it was a name that used to be known to every american school child as i know, and i've found sadly that, that's not-- %$* 215
seems not to be the case today. %$* 215
and he was an american spy for george washington during the american revolution, hanged by the british, and the reason he was remembered during my growing up was for his words on the gallows: "i regret that i have but one life to give for my country." what country was that? %$* 215
not the country of his birth, that was the colony of king george iii, in which he was in rebellion, and was charged with treason essentially, of which he was essentially guilty to george iii, like every other signer of the declaration of independence, five of whom, out of 56, were hanged as a result. %$* 215
but they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, like nathan hale, to a country that did not yet exist in the world, a country of-- %$* 215
later to be, shortly to be-- %$* 215
of a constitution with separation of powers, independent branches with checks and balances against each other, and a country with a bill of rights. %$* 215
when snowden said there were things worth dying for, i agree with him. %$* 215
that's the mood in which i gave the pentagon papers, and i think he was right to do what he did to defend and protect the constitution of the united states. %$* 215
thank you, daniel ellsberg. %$* 13
motion is "snowden was justified," and here to make his argument against this motion, our final speaker in the opening round, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
he is a contributing editor to the national review and a former federal prosecutor. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
let me jump right in. %$* 48
it's interesting that mr. %$* 48
ellsberg should be able to say that he's not able-- %$* 48
or at this point-- %$* 48
to process what's in the documents. %$* 48
what ambassador woolsey was referring to was analyses of the actual documents that have been released. %$* 48
if he can't say what's in the documents, that puts him in a common place with edward snowden himself. %$* 48
notice that mr. %$* 48
ellsberg mentioned that he removed, he said, somewhere been four- and seven- thousand documents. %$* 48
and that's what was put out. %$* 48
snowden has released 1.7 million documents. %$* 48
he couldn't conceivably have known what was in the documents at the time of purloining them and putting them out. %$* 48
we're talking about a massively different leak, and one that's been massively damaging to the united states. %$* 48
john mentioned that this is my second rodeo at intelligence squared. %$* 48
i think it's worth revisiting the first one, because it says a lot about the trajectory that we've walked on this road, between liberty and security. %$* 48
when i was here the last time, the question was whether we needed to have more surveillance to prevent terrorist attacks. %$* 48
and-- %$* 48
it was interesting-- %$* 48
the audience was of a mind that, you know, we absolutely did need more surveillance. %$* 48
they recognized we had serious enemies of the united states who wanted to mass murder americans. %$* 48
but something made them uncomfortable. %$* 48
and when we got to talk to them afterwards, i got to find out what the something was: george bush. %$* 48
not george bush the person, but the concept that so much power was reposed in one individual-- %$* 48
that one person could be able to order warrantless surveillance, that one person could get to be the judge, the jury-- %$* 48
in some instances, as commander-in-chief-- %$* 48
the executioner, on the basis of the information that was gleaned from the warrantless surveillance that was ordered, surveillance that took place without the permission of a court. %$* 48
and that was what the audience back then had the most trouble with, this idea that we don't have enough checks and balances. %$* 48
we don't have enough legislative buy-in. %$* 48
we don't have enough judicial oversight. %$* 48
it's interesting, because what president bush was trying to impose on this sort of new kind of war was old rules of war. %$* 48
and they were probably best explained in 1948-- %$* 48
at least the reason for them-- %$* 48
by robert jackson, who's an interesting person in american history because he's a giant in both american law and american politics. %$* 48
nuremberg prosecutor, supreme court justice, fdr's attorney general. %$* 48
in a 1948 case, called chicago and southern airlines v. %$* 48
waterman-- %$* 48
he explained why national security had to be an executive responsibility. %$* 48
and the primary reason was, in a free democracy, the framers thought the most important decisions we make are the decisions about our national security. %$* 48
and they need to be made by elected officials who answer to the people whose lives are at stake. %$* 48
and when you transfer that responsibility over to courts, you take it from the accountable public officials to public officials who are purposely insulated from politics and who you can't get rid of when they get it wrong. %$* 48
well, we've spent about a half- century now experimenting-- %$* 48
and i think the experiment is still ongoing-- %$* 48
with how far we can afford to depart from the vision of the framers. %$* 48
and from the 1970s forward, what we have tried to do is take rule of law protocols-- %$* 48
which apply to the united states, and mainly the law enforcement system, in peace time-- %$* 48
and impose them on war. %$* 48
and we've had a very difficult time doing it. %$* 48
it's been a blistering debate, at times. %$* 48
and nobody's happy about it. %$* 48
nobody's ever happy about what the outcome is. %$* 48
some people think the executive doesn't have enough control anymore. %$* 48
some think the courts are too involved. %$* 48
some think the courts are not involved enough. %$* 48
but here's the interesting thing. %$* 48
we did get to a place where we came together as a country-- %$* 48
and even if everybody was not satisfied with the outcome, we did strike a balance. %$* 48
we established laws which took away a lot of the president's unilateral power; forced the president to go to judges in order to get surveillance authority; institutionalized rigorous congressional oversight. %$* 48
in fact, most of what we know about abuses at the nsa actually comes from self-reporting, whether it's self-reporting to courts or self-reporting to congress. %$* 48
you may not like the laws. %$* 48
i don't like the laws the way that they've-- %$* 48
the way that they’ve finally played out. %$* 48
the nsa program, the metadata program’s a perfect example. %$* 48
there's no question that it's constitutional-- %$* 48
the supreme court precedent that holds that. %$* 48
whether it's legal or not under the statute that congress imposed is a closer question. %$* 48
it turns on what the legal definition of relevance, as applied to this national security question, is. %$* 48
is it legal, is it not legal? %$* 48
you can make the argument that it's not, but 15 federal judges who've looked at it have upheld it. %$* 48
and nobody has repealed it yet for all the talk about doing that. %$* 48
but here's the thing: we actually set up this system with exactly the checks and balances that were at issue during the bush days, the bad old bush days when too much power was reposed in one person. %$* 48
and now where are we with edward snowden? %$* 48
we are right back to one person who's judge, jury, lawgiver, one person who decides what american secrets get kept and what gets exposed to our enemies. %$* 48
and that person's not the president anymore. %$* 48
that person is a person who had access to this information because he violated his oath. %$* 48
the last time i was here, the audience told me that could never, ever be justified. %$* 48
thank you, andrew mccarthy. %$* 13
and that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "snowden was justified." and keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening. %$* 13
and remember, we're going to have you vote again immediately after you've heard the closing arguments. %$* 13
and the team that has moved your numbers the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now onto round 2.in round 2, the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
our motion is this: snowden was justified. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, we've heard from daniel ellsberg and ben wizner. %$* 13
they have argued basically that the reaction itself to the revelations, the spasm of reform undergoing-- %$* 13
under-- %$* 13
happening in washington now indicates that something was wrong, that there was something to blow the whistle on. %$* 13
they also say that the whistleblower system itself internally is broken, that the watchdog system itself internally is broken. %$* 13
and at bottom, there was no other way for edward snowden to do what he wanted to do. %$* 13
and by the way, he didn't set out to spy for our enemies. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, james woolsey and andrew mccarthy say nothing justifies what edward snowden has done to the united states; that in fact he has caused series harm to america's security. %$* 13
they went through a list of specific programs that were clever, involved a great deal of investment and that now have been obliterated by his action to the detriment of everyone's security. %$* 13
they say a sign of the irresponsibility of what he did was the sheer number of documents that he released. %$* 13
he could not have possibly known himself what was in all of them, and that, by the way, the internal system does work. %$* 13
oversight, carefully negotiated and worked out for years is functioning as well as it can. %$* 13
i want to put first to the side that's arguing against this motion, this question of-- %$* 13
that didn't really come up very much in either of the opening statements-- %$* 13
as to whether what snowden revealed to the degree that we know it was in any way say whistle worthy. %$* 13
was there something there that was going wrong that needed to change? %$* 13
and i think in terms of the headline stuff of angela merkel's phone being listened into and then the one that everybody here has that direct connection to, the metadata. %$* 13
anything wrong with those programs? %$* 13
did they need to be exposed in the first place, andrew mccarthy? %$* 13
well, it's interesting, one of the last times that fbi director muller testified before congress, he was asked by our congressmen here in new york, jerry nadler, what the big deal was about this, because as far as the metadata was concerned, he said we know all about this. %$* 48
we heard about bulk collections back in 2006.usa today had put an article out back then. %$* 48
he said that the broad outlines of this were known, even known to the public. %$* 48
they were vigorously argued about at the time the patriot act was amended and at the time of the overhaul of the foreign intelligence surveillance act. %$* 48
so in terms of the program that is most controversial, there's no question that what snowden has revealed has filled out some details that we didn't know about and certainly the breadth of what's been collected makes you blanch when you hear it. %$* 48
but in principle, that part of the revelation has been known for a long period of time. %$* 48
the revelations that he made that have helped our enemies, the ones that ambassador woolsey went through and many other ones, i mean, i don't know how you even say with a straight face that-- %$* 48
but, so, andrew, just to focus on the question-- %$* 13
i hear where you're going with this. %$* 13
but to the basic question of whether there was really anything whistle blow worthy that we know of, you're not concerned by what he revealed as being in violation of the constitution, which is his argument. %$* 13
that's two different things. %$* 48
it's not that i'm not concerned. %$* 48
congress is concerned. %$* 48
that's why there'll probably be some modifications of the law. %$* 48
was it whistleblower worthy? %$* 48
no. %$* 48
okay. %$* 13
let me go to ben wizner, please, on the other side. %$* 13
your response. %$* 13
well, i've been following this issue very closely, to say the least, over the last ten years or more. %$* 214
i did not know until the guardian published the document that the nsa, which is a foreign intelligence agency, was, on a daily basis, collecting the phone records of almost every american. %$* 214
someone else who didn't know, or says he didn't know is republican representative jim sensenbrenner who was one of the principal authors of the patriot act, who says that he didn't know until this document was published that section 215 of the patriot act was being used in this way. %$* 214
whether, again, that's true or not isn't important to my argument. %$* 214
either he did not know-- %$* 214
he certainly should have known. %$* 214
either way, congress didn't do anything about it. %$* 214
as soon as the public was read into this debate, we're now seeing open federal courts debate the constitutionality of this. %$* 214
one federal judge actually enjoined it and said it's almost certainly unconstitutional. %$* 214
and we're seeing congress threaten not to reauthorize this unless the administration will agree to reforms. %$* 214
james woolsey. %$* 13
much of the controversy here involves metadata, which lets the executive branch-- %$* 216
and has for many years-- %$* 216
lets them see and keep a record of what is on the outside of an envelope, let's say, in first class mail, the address, the return address, and the postmark. %$* 216
that's been approved by the courts for a long time. %$* 216
it has been true for decades, it's true now. %$* 216
that is basically metadata with first class mail. %$* 216
if you do it with telephone calls, call number that was called, number that was called from, length of call. %$* 216
what has changed here is not that the federal government has gone away from a reasonable policy. %$* 216
it was, and i think it still is. %$* 216
what's changed is moore's law. %$* 216
what's changed is now we are talking about emails and telephone calls in the gazillions rather than first class letters. %$* 216
but you still do not hear of substantial malfeasance or other steps using simply the metadata. %$* 216
so james woolsey, you're saying there really was no-- %$* 13
the alarm did not need to be rung. %$* 13
there wasn't a fire in that sense. %$* 13
where alarms need to be running, they should be discussed, and sometimes it's important. %$* 216
i stood behind at the time and i stand behind daniel ellsberg now for his courage in moving on the pentagon papers. %$* 216
he was dealing with policy issues and major lies that had come at us from the executive branch, and he did a courageous job, defended himself in court. %$* 216
federal government misbehaved, and he was released. %$* 216
but what daniel ellsberg did i think deserved a whistle blowing. %$* 216

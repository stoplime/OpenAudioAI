so i'll draw a lesson from all those studies also which there's almost a consensus, or overwhelming evidence. %$* 558
another question? %$* 13
let's not-- %$* 472
let's just not-- %$* 472
let's just not make this parallel. %$* 472
asra, i'm going to move-- %$* 13
i'm going to move on, or we're going to stay forever on one question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 472
thanks. %$* 13
anybody raising their hands in that direction? %$* 13
many more over here. %$* 13
gentleman in the-- %$* 13
yeah, white shirt. %$* 13
and if you could rise. %$* 13
and if any members of the news media, if you ask a question, could you please identify yourself as such. %$* 13
it sounds to me as if the question has been framed so narrowly that it's very difficult to answer. %$* 18
using racial and religious profiling, i mean-- %$* 18
can you-- %$* 13
can you hold your mic right up? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
the people for it have said that-- %$* 18
to use racial and religious profiling is correct and effective. %$* 18
but they've also said that you should use all types of profiling, which i also think is correct. %$* 18
i'd like to know, from those who think you shouldn't do it, what you should do, what we should do. %$* 18
well, i think what you should do is you look at behavior. %$* 306
now, what do i mean by that? %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
and it depends on whether you have the information. %$* 306
but we collect a lot of this, for example, from people coming from overseas. %$* 306
who paid for the ticket? %$* 306
what's your travel history? %$* 306
what's your telephone number, for example, that you used as your contact number. %$* 306
if we have information that someone has studied at a radical school, if we see literature that they have that suggests that they may be extremists. %$* 306
all that is fair game. %$* 306
so you're saying-- %$* 13
but religious behavior. %$* 13
it's behavior. %$* 306
it is things that you are doing. %$* 306
but it's religious behavior you're talking about. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 306
and that's not profiling. %$* 306
i mean, there's no question-- %$* 306
i think we have to be clear about this. %$* 306
there's no question that if somebody affirmatively trains to be a terrorist, the fact that the terrorist camp says islam training camp doesn't immunize them from having us look at that. %$* 306
that would be crazy. %$* 306
what racial and religious profiling is about is looking at someone's race or religion, assuming you can figure out what it is, and saying based on that, i'm going to single them out. %$* 306
and that is the proposition that was offered. %$* 306
and that's what we're arguing against. %$* 306
another question? %$* 13
sir in the blue-- %$* 13
you're wearing a blue shirt and a blazer. %$* 13
yeah, if you're looking at your shirt, that was you. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
it seems to me the question is should u.s.airports use any racial or religious profiling. %$* 18
and i guess i feel like i hear the two teams sort of arguing different sides of that. %$* 18
so i guess the question i have is should u.s. airports use any racial or religious profiling at all. %$* 18
can i answer that one? %$* 557
yes, debra burlingame. %$* 13
you all remember the infamous flying imams from four years ago at thanksgiving time. %$* 557
they boarded a plane to a u.s.airport in minneapolis. %$* 557
they called attention to themselves because they were standing in the heaviest traveled time of the year in a boarding area. %$* 557
they got down on the floor and started doing muslim prayers very loudly. %$* 557
they were shouting out “allahu akbar! %$* 557
allahu akbar! %$* 557
” very, very loudly. %$* 557
frightened the passengers all around them because, let's face it, “allahu akbar,” i wrote about this for the “wall street journal,” is the last thing that was-- %$* 557
that you hear on the flight data-- %$* 557
or the cockpit voice recorder of 93 as it's screamed into the ground. %$* 557
we associate that for good or ill with something bad in this country. %$* 557
so passengers hear that. %$* 557
did that prevent them from being allowed to board that plane? %$* 557
no. %$* 557
but they called attention to themselves. %$* 557
that was a way that people knew that they were muslim. %$* 557
it wasn't just because of the arab dress. %$* 557
once they got on the plane, they weren't finished. %$* 557
they-- %$* 557
they were together in the boarding area. %$* 557
but now they're scattered in the front, center and back of the plane. %$* 557
this is the exact configuration of the 9/11 execution teams. %$* 557
they asked for seat belt extensions for obese people. %$* 557
none of these men were obese. %$* 557
they rolled them up tightly and put them under their seats. %$* 557
now, remember, everyone's watching them now. %$* 557
and this is all behavior. %$* 557
what i would say to you is, sir, is that the fact that they yelled “allahu akbar” and were praying in the muslim custom, although it's not customary to pray in an airport. %$* 557
and in fact every muslim that i've ever spoken to says, “no. %$* 557
you can't just drop and pray in the middle of times square. %$* 557
there are dispensations for time, place and location.” once they've-- %$* 557
debra, can-- %$* 13
once they've identified themselves as muslim, then you're not profiling any more. %$* 557
you're just being minimally observant. %$* 557
okay. %$* 13
asra nomani. %$* 13
and you don't ignore it. %$* 557
asra nomani to respond. %$* 13
but what was the religion that was being profiled there? %$* 472
it was islam. %$* 472
i mean, we can't deny that. %$* 472
we're not yelling out the lord’s prayer, now was it? %$* 18
it was their behavior that got -them in trouble, not their religion. %$* 557
it was religious profiling. %$* 472
disagree. %$* 557
that's the sensible thing to do. %$* 472
and just to this argument that hassan made earlier that it's unconstitutional, we have had a supreme court decision that has established that if there is pressing public necessity-- %$* 472
i'm sorry. %$* 13
can you be terse on this. %$* 13
sure. %$* 472
i'll let you go but be terse. %$* 13
but if there's pressing public necessity, then we do have to take considerations like racial and religious profiling into account and make that possible. %$* 472
we do it with our visa waiver program already. %$* 472
those countries from which the terrorists have been identified as coming from, they don't-- %$* 472
they're not part of a visa waiver program, countries like germany, greece, england, they are part of it-- %$* 472
because we've identified as a nation that we-- %$* 472
why do you think osama bin laden sent richard reid, the shoe bomber, and moussaoui, he sent them in the second wave because they had western passports and they anticipated that, that would now be scrutinized after 9/11. .6 %$* 557
and they're trying to outsmart our profiling. %$* 472
and so we again, as i said earlier, need to outsmart them. %$* 472
question from the second row. %$* 13
ma'am, you're wearing a green scarf. %$* 13
yeah, we'll bring a mike to you. %$* 13
dana, how much time do you think we have to go on with questions? %$* 13
one more after this? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
my question is for those arguing for this motion, do you agree that the word "u.s." can be replaced with any other country facing threats? %$* 19
and in that case, given the amount of state terrorism sponsored by the united states in the middle east, thousands of iraqis, afghans killed, should u.s. citizens everywhere be profiled? %$* 19
bob baer. %$* 13
well, they are profiled. %$* 559
yeah. %$* 472
i mean, if i go to the tribal areas of pakistan, you can count on it that i would-- %$* 559
right, would be-- %$* 472
well, no, any place we're at war with, same with iraq. %$* 559
it happens. %$* 472
yes, i'm profiled. %$* 559
i mean, that's why american citizens oftentimes will hide their passport when they travel to countries like this, because they are profiled. %$* 472
i happen to think the united states is a force for good, so i would-- %$* 556
i certainly reject the premise of your question. %$* 556
one more question. %$* 13
right there. %$* 13
i have a question for judge chertoff. %$* 18
so i agree if we have detailed information about someone's personal behavior that may be more probative than race or religion but a lot of times we don't have that information. %$* 18
a lot of times all we know is that someone bought a ticket with cash, or they're not traveling with luggage. %$* 18
we don't have the resources to stop everyone who bought a ticket with cash who doesn't have luggage. %$* 18
we do have the resources to stop every muslim who paid in cash who doesn't have luggage. %$* 18
do you agree that if all we know about someone is they paid in cash or they're carrying no luggage, that if we add in the fact that they're muslim, that increases the probability they might be a sponsor of terrorism? %$* 18
yeah, here's my problem. %$* 306
my problem is i have a lot of difficulty understanding how we're going to know they're muslims. %$* 306
you know, at the-- %$* 306
we don't carry our religion around, and we don't state our religion when we buy tickets, and your ability to guess who's a muslim would have probably have failed if you'd come to face to face with jose padilla, or danny maldonado. %$* 306
i understand that-- %$* 306
the desire to believe there's some way of separating groups out like this but the difficulty is you’re way over inclusive in some respects, but more important frankly, and more troubling is, you're under inclusive because the guy who you really have to worry about is the guy who is not going to let you know he‘s a muslim, and that’s the flaw in using religious or racial profiling, is it’s not an accurate-- %$* 306
there’s not an accurate tool to measure who meets that particular profile. %$* 306
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here’s where we are, we are about to hear closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember, you in the audience voted before this debate, you’re going to get to vote again. %$* 13
this is their last chance to change your minds, just a few minutes from now when you pick the winner. %$* 13
so on to round three, closing statements, to speak first against the motion, debra burlingame, cofounder of keep america safe and 9/11 families for a safe and strong america. %$* 13
our motion is "u.s. airports should use racial and religious profiling." debra burlingame. %$* 13
i’m going to close with a story, a real story. %$* 557
i actually spoke to this man just yesterday because i wanted to make sure i had my facts straight. %$* 557
he worked for 26 years at american airlines. %$* 557
he got a nickname, a moniker, called "the detective," because he was so, so good at picking out bad actors. %$* 557
he was a customer service agent at american airlines on the morning of 9/11.and he boarded two of the muslim hijackers that were probably the men who killed my brother. %$* 557
these men stood out to him. %$* 557
they were nawaf and salem al-hazmi. %$* 557
and here’s what he said about them, "they paid in $2,000, cash, paper tickets, they were in first-class dressed poorly, not just cheap shoes, the kind of shoes poor people would wear. %$* 557
i couldn’t understand what people dressed like that would be doing in a first class cabin.” and he didn’t know if they were saudis. %$* 557
he thought they might be pakistanis but all he knew was that this picture didn’t add up so he selected them for secondary screening. %$* 557
he said and by the way, saudis sometimes have people who can’t speak english. %$* 557
these guys, neither one of them could speak english or understand his questions. %$* 557
sometimes saudis will have servants travel with them in first class but they’re usually nannies, they’re women, not beefy guys who looked like this. %$* 557
he selected them for secondary screening and he said “i normally walk them over surreptitiously and nod to the agents to let them know be sure you check these guys good.” he said “i didn’t do that that time” and it’s been rough for him. %$* 557
i asked him one last question. %$* 557
i said to him is there-- %$* 557
“was the fact that they were arab looking have any effect on your actions that day” and he said “yes. %$* 557
i didn’t walk them over that day because i didn’t want my colleague to think i was a racist and a bigot.” and that, to me, is what i believe will happen in u.s.airports and will happen in this country. %$* 557
it will have a reverse effect of people being afraid of being identified as racists and bigots because they call people out on the basis of-- %$* 557
debra burlingame, your time is up. %$* 13
their skin color or their religion. %$* 557
debra burlingame, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s. airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and now to summarize his position for this motion, deroy murdock, a syndicated columnist with the “scripps-howard news service” and a media fellow with the hoover institution. %$* 13
well thank you very much and thank you to my opponents and my colleagues for what i think has been an excellent and lively debate. %$* 556
i think the general position that we’ve heard from the other side is that since it’s impossible to catch everyone who might pose a threat to our country and our flying public and who want to kill us, therefore we shouldn’t even attempt to find those who might have those malicious intentions. %$* 556
it is true that you might, in an effort to catch everyone who happens to be a muslim, perhaps not catch someone like jose padilla who was of hispanic background and converted to islam or perhaps people who have gone through “prislam” as i believe debra put it who have gone to prison and been radicalized there and might be black and therefore they might slip through the profile. %$* 556
but because they might not go through the profile doesn’t mean that we ignore the fact that people from the middle east who are islamic, unfortunately they represent the profile of the people who threaten this country at this time. %$* 556
i think you certainly can check by looking at things like passports which definitely will give us a sense of where they come from maybe not on a domestic flight but certainly on international flights and people going through international airports. %$* 556
i also think that if al qaeda gets smart and says “well i guess they’re looking for people who like those who were 9/11 hijackers we probably should go to the trouble of finding women who are blonde haired, blue-eyed.” .7 %$* 556
let al qaeda go to the trouble of finding blonde-haired, blue-eyed women who agree with them and want to blow themselves up then it’s going to be a lot more difficult for them to fish around in that pool than to find more muslim men who are 18 to 35.let’s at least make things difficult for them. %$* 556
the last point i’d make is the consequences of this. %$* 556
i’m very sympathetic to the point hassan has made about muslim children asking their parents if they’re going through questioning at the airports, “daddy, did you do something wrong? %$* 556
daddy, are we criminals? %$* 556
” that is very tragic and very sad. %$* 556
but i think the other consequence we must remember is if somebody slips through and we have something like the plane flying over detroit which was attacked; fortunately, the bomb did not go off. %$* 556
if we have something like that happen, we have much, much worse consequences than people feeling duly upset and saddened. %$* 556
we want to keep them alive no matter where they’re from. %$* 556
thank you, deroy murdock. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s. airports should use racial and religious profiling” and now summarizing his position against the motion, hassan abbas, international and public affairs professor at columbia university and former official in the benazir bhutto and pervez musharaff administrations. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 558
i would just make you one big request which is not to ignore and always to remember the very idea of america. %$* 558
i would highly encourage you to go and read the fourth amendment and the fourteenth. %$* 558
reading the first amendment will not be that harmful also. %$* 558
so don't forget about the essence. %$* 558
what terrorists want. %$* 558
they actually want to scare you into making wrong choices. %$* 558
terrorism starts influencing your policy choices. %$* 558
and terrorism plays fear on you, fear of the unknown, fear of the unknown attack. %$* 558
when will the next attack happen? %$* 558
i have heard senior intelligence and security people say, “we are certain the next attack is going to happen. %$* 558
we just don't know when.” well, these kinds of generalizations at times are counterproductive. %$* 558
i would argue we are not saying on this side that there should be no profiling of any sort. %$* 558
we are saying, yes, based on behavior, based on information, based on intelligence, how do you collect intelligence? %$* 558
do you think it's all about these iphones and listening to telephones and wire tapping? %$* 558
no. %$* 558
it is about having access to those communities which are at risk. %$* 558
communities which are also fighting extremists. %$* 558
don't forget that within the muslim world in the united states and all around the world, there are people among the muslims, majority, mainstream, who are fighting extremists. %$* 558
don't just lump all of them together by your one policy choice. %$* 558
don't isolate them. %$* 558
don't lose the hearts and minds. %$* 558
so yes, do profiling, but don't lump anyone together. %$* 558
that will be something exactly opposite to all what this great country stands for. %$* 558
thank you, hassan abbas. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s. arguments should use racial and religious profiling.” and summarizing her position for the motion, asra nomani, author and former “wall street journal” reporter who teaches journalism at georgetown. %$* 13
debra told a very moving story about a man who was among the last to see the hijackers. %$* 472
what is it that he said? %$* 472
he said that “they looked like arab terrorists if i'd ever seen them,” according to the media reports when he was interviewed. %$* 472
if that man could have participated in some type of religious and racial profiling, perhaps the tragedy that we knew on 9/11 could have been mitigated somewhat. %$* 472
and that is the motion. %$* 472
we're not talking about persecution. %$* 472
we're not talking about discrimination. %$* 472
i know every single one of you, no matter what your narrative has faced some sort of discrimination in your life. %$* 472
there is no need to add trauma to people who have already been traumatized. %$* 472
but to argue that we will create new extremists is, i think,-- %$* 472
is completely without basis because they have enough reason to hate us. %$* 472
that same saudi koran that i read to you, that translation, it says “then when the sacred months have passed, then kill the nonbelievers wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them.” these are people who are not the majority inside of our muslim community. %$* 472
it's not what speaks from my heart. %$* 472
it is not what speaks from my father's heart. %$* 472
it's not what speaks from hassan's heart. %$* 472
but there is a minority inside of our global community today who believe this interpretation of islam. %$* 472
and we have to figure out how to identify them so that we can keep our skies safe and so that we can actually live lives that-- %$* 472
in which we don't have to be in fear. %$* 472
i urge you to vote for the motion that airports should use religious and racial profiling. %$* 472
we need to be smarter than the enemy. %$* 472
thank you, asra nomani. %$* 13
.1 “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling,” that's our motion. %$* 13
and now to summarize his position against the motion, michael chertoff, former secretary of homeland security and cofounder of the chertoff group. %$* 13
i agree with asra, we do need to be smarter. %$* 306
and that's what concerns me about the motion that's been put. %$* 306
i think it's not smarter. %$* 306
i think it attempts to fight the struggle of 2010 by looking at what we faced in 2001.we all agree we have to look for extremists. %$* 306
the problem is that what i've heard today is a list of preconceptions about what the extremists look like. %$* 306
i have not heard anybody say how they're going to figure out what religion you are at the airport while you're waiting online. %$* 306
i haven't heard anybody say what are the races that are included in the profiling and what are the races that are not included in the profiling. %$* 306
and what really concerns me is this. %$* 306
if you can't pick out people except by looking at what you imagine an arab looks like or a south asian looks like or by looking at a name or a face and trying to say this is a muslim. %$* 306
if that's what you're focused on, you're not focused on the kind of subtle cues that actually tell you when somebody is dangerous. %$* 306
the fact is it's not something we're speculating about. %$* 306
we know because colleen larose told us. %$* 306
the enemy is acutely aware of what we imagine a terrorist looks like. %$* 306
and unfortunately, they're having no difficulty recruiting people in prisons or in western europe or in the united states, including blond-haired blue-eyed women to carry out terrorist acts. %$* 306
so for me, it's a very simple choice, frankly. %$* 306
every other consideration goes secondary to the issue of being effective. %$* 306
that's what i spent most of the last 10 years trying to do, is be effective in preventing this from happening again. %$* 306
and i don't think we're effective if we take what i consider to be the lazy man's way out of trying to figure out who fits a racial or religious profile as opposed to what is real intelligence analysis, which is to look at behavior. %$* 306
if religion is part of that behavior and is an element of what you see that gives you a specific behavioral picture, that's not profiling. %$* 306
that's good intelligence work. %$* 306
but i-- %$* 306
thank you, michael chertoff. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s. airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and now here to summarize his position for the motion, robert baer, a former cia field officer assigned to the middle east and currently time.com's intelligence columnist and a best-selling author. %$* 13
i apologize for ending this on a bit of an academic note, but i would like to take a country that i'm not particularly fond of and i wrote a book about, and they're not fond of me either, and that's saudi arabia. %$* 559
saudi arabia had a very bad terrorism problem 2003, 2004.princes were being killed. %$* 559
car bombs were going off. %$* 559
and we got a new king in saudi arabia, king abdullah. %$* 559
and he sat down with his intelligence chief, hamid bin naif and he said profile. %$* 559
who are the people. %$* 559
where are they coming from, what tribe, what sect, what religion. %$* 559
the first thing they sat down, and they eliminated immediately saudi shia who were an oppressed minority. %$* 559
but they were not blowing themselves up. %$* 559
they were not turning to suicide bombings, radical islam. %$* 559
since then, all attacks on saudi arabia have come from outside the country. %$* 559
they have whipped the problem. %$* 559
of course, it's a home-grown problem. %$* 559
they knew about it. %$* 559
but what they did was they profiled. %$* 559
i would prefer if we had the opportunity and we had the intelligence to base all of our profiling on behavior, tickets, flight lists, the history of people, digital databases, credit checks. %$* 559
but right now, this country does not have that capacity to run an algorithm through every single flight that comes into this country. %$* 559
nor can it even keep track of the people that are in this country. %$* 559
and this forces the police and tsos to fall back on a very primitive unattractive weapon. %$* 559
but it's the only weapon we have at this point until our intelligence gets better. %$* 559
thank you. %$* 559
thank you, bob baer. %$* 13
that was bob baer. %$* 13
bob baer speaking for the motion. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
once again, the side that has changed the most minds is the one that we declare our winner. %$* 13
so we're asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we will get this readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
our motion is “u.s.arguments should use racial and religious profiling.” push number one if you are for the motion. %$* 13
push number two if you are against and number three if you are undecided or became undecided. %$* 13
and we will have the results really in about a minute. %$* 13
in the meantime, i wanted to thank all of our panelists for coming here and debating with great integrity and intelligence. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and also the caliber of questions and comments from you in the audience was also outstanding. %$* 13
thank you for that. %$* 13
we wanted to let you know that this spring at intelligence squared u.s., we're going to be doing something new. %$* 13
we are doing an umbrella series. %$* 13
the umbrella title is “america's house divided.” and we will be focusing on some of the more important policy issues that represent this division and debate about whether we need to bridge the division. %$* 13
the topics will be the economy, the two-party system, america's global influence, energy policy and immigration reform. %$* 13
the dates and the tentative language of the motions are these, january 11, “repeal obama care;” february 15, “the two-party system is making america ungovernable;” .8 %$* 13
march 8, “renewable energy cannot power america;” april 5, “it’s time to clip america's global wings;” and, may 3, “don’t give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.” they’re all on tuesday evenings, and tickets are available though our website and at the skirball box office. %$* 13
you can also follow intelligence squared now on twitter and on facebook. %$* 13
and if you friend us on facebook you’ll get a discount. %$* 13
as we’ve mentioned before, this debate will be available, we’ll be airing on bloomberg television starting next monday at 9 p.m., eastern time, and on more than 220 npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
you can also find out the times from just looking at your local areas. %$* 13
that was our 44th debate tonight, and we look forward to seeing you in january when we have our 45th debate. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it’s all in. %$* 13
i’ve been given the results. %$* 13
now, remember, the team that changes the most minds is declared the victor, and here it is. %$* 13
before the debate, 37 percent were for this motion, "u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling," 37 percent were for, 33 percent against, and 30 percent undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 49 percent are for the debate, that is up 12 percent, 40 percent were against, that's up only seven percent, 11 percent remain undecided. %$* 13

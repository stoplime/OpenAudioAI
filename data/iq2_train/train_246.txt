it was bad. %$* 646
there was legal effectivelyuntil 1967-- %$* 646
but weren't young people considered pretty cool in the '60s? %$* 13
not by old people, you know? %$* 646
and the same thing happened with ecstasy. %$* 646
how many of you-- %$* 646
i mean, if you're over 50, you had the opportunity to use ecstasy legally until 1986.it was then demonized as a youth drug, first, one that made you antisocial, then one that made you prosocial and you'd go out to a rave and have sex all night or dehydrate. %$* 646
but more importantly-- %$* 646
you know, well, hydration is very important, you know. %$* 646
it's the skin. %$* 646
more importantly, we need to dial back the hysteria. %$* 646
so, for instance, i just want to focus on one point that was being-- %$* 646
nick-- %$* 13
asa-- %$* 13
wait, just-- %$* 646
no, no-- %$* 13
methamphetamine, one-tenth of 1 percent of people in america report having used it in the past 30 days. %$* 646
is the drug war edifice, all of the costs in money and in monetary and human terms, is it worth trying to stop that one-tenth of 1 percent of americans-- %$* 646
theodore dalrymple, arguing against the motion. %$* 13
i just want to make a small logical point. %$* 647
we are not actually discussing whether the laws are correctly applied but whether there should be any laws. %$* 647
and so actually it's not-- %$* 647
i mean, i know that it's very important for people in america, the way that they are applied, but the fact is that we're debating whether there should be any laws at all, not whether we should have present laws. %$* 647
all right. %$* 13
let's take asa's question to you, nick gillespie. %$* 13
asa huntchinson, you were asking what does this new world look like where drugs are legalized? %$* 13
may i frame it? %$* 448
sure. %$* 13
so in terms of-- %$* 448
take heroin or methamphetamine, i would presume if it's legalized the state would be granting licenses so they can regulate the purity and the quality of the heroin and that the methamphetamine is quality stuff. %$* 448
so if you regulate it, and you have to regulate it to tax it, so i am curious, one, is this not another government regime that's being created with a libertarian argument that you're creating? %$* 448
so you're creating more government by your libertarian approach, wanting to legalize drugs because they're going to have to regulate it and tax it-- %$* 448
so how's that going to work? %$* 448
i-- %$* 448
all right, nick gillespie. %$* 13
respectfully submit that i have never taken a drug strong enough for that argument to be convincing. %$* 646
but in colorado, you know, the initiative that was passed for marijuana legalization was basically, i mean, it was out there, and it's a similar thing in washington state, to treat marijuana like wine, beer, and alcohol. %$* 646
so it's not a question-- %$* 646
and, theodore, i think your opposition is-- %$* 646
so it's licensed by the state. %$* 647
is a false-- %$* 646
yeah, well, it could be. %$* 646
that remains to be seen actually because each-- %$* 646
washington state has about a year to figure out the technical implementation and colorado has about six months, but it's not a choice between anarchy and, i'll ratchet it down, regulatory system, but there will be laws. %$* 646
there will be customs. %$* 646
there will be traditions. %$* 646
there will be advertising. %$* 646
there will be information available. %$* 646
and i-- %$* 646
the real question is about legalizing drugs. %$* 646
do you consider alcohol to be legal? %$* 646
let's have a regime that is very similar to that for currently illegal substances. %$* 646
let me step in and ask paul butler something. %$* 13
paul, you made-- %$* 13
drew a distinction between treating addiction and punishing addiction, which suggests that perhaps unlike your partner you're talking about addiction as a problem that needs to be addressed by society. %$* 13
do you split with each other on that? %$* 13
do you think that it's this-- %$* 13
in other words, are you saying drug use is a problem? %$* 13
well, i think addiction is a medical issue, and i think nick and i agree that only a small percentage of people who use drugs become addicted to it. %$* 645
so most people are able to use marijuana and other drugs recreationally and go to work the next day. %$* 645
most people are also able to do that with alcohol. %$* 645
for the percentage of people who have substance abuse problems with it, we know, the good doctor knows, that's a health issue. %$* 645
police, prosecutors, they make lousy doctors. %$* 645
jailers make even worse doctors. %$* 645
so the way to treat that problem, the way to heal those people is to use what we know about, and not what we know about locking people up, because what we know about locking people up is, it doesn't work. %$* 645
dr. %$* 13
dalrymple. %$* 13
well, i actually don't agree that addiction is a-- %$* 647
it's fundamentally a medical problem. %$* 647
you think it's a moral problem? %$* 645
i do, yes. %$* 647
wow. %$* 645
well, a moral problem and a social problem and psychological problem and a spiritual problem. %$* 647
it's only to a very small extent a medical problem. %$* 647
i mean, there are medical consequences, of course, but this is not what is important. %$* 647
for example, everything-- %$* 647
i think that everything you think about heroin addiction is actually wrong. %$* 647
for example, you probably think that withdrawal effects from heroin are very severe, they're not, they're trivial. %$* 647
and the overwhelming evidence is that, by far, the most suffering from withdrawal effects is psychologically induced; it's anticipatory anxiety, it isn't the-- %$* 647
and there's good experimental evidence about this. %$* 647
you think that itâ€™s highly addictive, it isn't. %$* 647
most heroin addicts go at it for about a year before they're ever actually addicted. %$* 647
you think that there's a connection-- %$* 647
i've described the supposed connection between crime and addiction. %$* 647
the idea is that an addict goes out to obtain money in order for his addiction; there's no correlation in the amount of crime he commits and the amount of drugs he takes. %$* 647
and, actually, you find that they're all acquisitive criminals before they ever take heroin. %$* 647
let me ask your partner, asa hutchinson, a little bit of-- %$* 13
moving the discussion a little bit in a slightly more, perhaps, philosophical direction. %$* 13
maybe that's the wrong word. %$* 13
but we've heard a few references to alcohol and to prohibition and to the notion that, i think, nobody is disputing that alcohol is a drug on the panel, and the nation did try, amended the constitution, to outlaw alcohol consumption and decided it was a mistake. %$* 13
so, tonight everybody in the room can go afterwards and enjoy a glass of wine or a beer. %$* 13
what's the difference between alcohol and the prescribed drugs? %$* 13
they're all problematic drugs subject to abuse. %$* 448
in our democracy, we make decisions on which ones to legalize and which ones not to. %$* 448
those are decisions that are made. %$* 448
the debate question tonight, though, of course, is legalizing all drugs. %$* 448
and, again, i go back to the question, which relates to ending prohibition in the late 1920s. %$* 448
you ended prohibition on alcohol, use went up, availability went up, regulation went up, taxation went up, and you compare that to legalizing methamphetamine. %$* 448
you're going to have an opportunity for the state to regulate methamphetamine producers, you're going to have it available, because it's going to be legal, and it's going to be taxed, and so, the price will be set by the market place, which is regulated and taxed. %$* 448
and so, the question is, "will you end crime? %$* 448
will you end the cartels? %$* 448
will you end the black market because you regulate methamphetamine? %$* 448
" of course not. %$* 448
there's going to be those that don't want to pay the taxes, just like they don't want to pay the taxes on cigarettes, and there's going to be a black market there, and you're going to have enforcement efforts, you're going to have criminals out there that are still bypassing the law, and so all of your hope of ending the dea or ending law enforcement will not happen with legalization. %$* 448
nick gillespie. %$* 13
i think there's a major, kind of, conceptual error when we're talking about crime here. %$* 646
when-- %$* 646
we know that mexican drug cartels are killing people on both sides of the border. %$* 646
when's the last time you heard about a dos equis shoot out? %$* 646
where a beer distributor crossing the border-- %$* 646
hundreds of times murders committed under the influence of alcohol. %$* 647
the last time you heard about that sort of thing was during alcohol prohibition. %$* 646
and so, it's not that-- %$* 646
are you going to have a black market for methamphetamine? %$* 448
sure. %$* 646
you know what? %$* 646
we already do. %$* 646
what would happen is, if we had a legal one, the other social harms would be reduced. %$* 646
i'm not a utopian, what i do believe is that not only would responsible individuals have a broader palate of things to make their life better, but also, many bad things would diminish. %$* 646
when we're talking addiction or substance abuse-- %$* 646
you know, i don't drink anymore, because i was a bad drinker; i tried my hardest to drink and drink and drink, i gave it up. %$* 646
if i had to admit that i was a criminal as well as having a substance abuse problem, i doubt that i would've gotten there quite as fast as i did, which was long enough. %$* 646
a couple of small points. %$* 647
the murder rate in mexico is now between a third and quarter of what it was in the 1940s. %$* 647
that might surprise you, but it is a fact. %$* 647
when we look at the murder rate during prohibition, it is, of course, perfectly true that it went up during prohibition. %$* 647
it went up by 35 percent. %$* 647
and it came down after prohibition was ended. %$* 647
but in the same period before prohibition, the murder rate went up by 85 percent. %$* 647
and in six years between 1900 and 1906, the murder rates in this country went up by 325 percent. %$* 647
so i think that the relationship between violent crime and prohibition is probably not nearly as close as people imagine and that there was a secular trend in which it went up anyway. %$* 647
and you could even make the case that it slowed the rise in the murder rate. %$* 647
i wouldn't make that case. %$* 647
but it's not straight-- %$* 647
it's not as straight forward-- %$* 647
the world did not begin in 1919. and the murder rate went up both absolutely and relatively more before-- %$* 647
in the years before prohibition than during prohibition. %$* 647
and incidentally, scarface got his scar before prohibition. %$* 647
and he didn't get it from plastic surgery. %$* 647
so the reason that most people don't smoke isn't because smoking tobacco is a crime. %$* 645
it's because we know it's not good for us. %$* 645
that's the same reason why even a regime of legalization, the vast majority of us are not going to use heroin or meth. %$* 645
but it's public health that will be responsible-- %$* 645
the most responsible way for treating people who abuse those substances. %$* 645
paul, can i interrupt? %$* 13
i'm going to ask a question from something that asa hutchinson, your opponent said earlier, in which he reported that in the last 30 years, the use of drugs by americans has declined 50 percent. %$* 13
and he sees that correlation being directly related to causation, that the drug war actually means that fewer men's use drugs. %$* 13
are you impressed by that statistic? %$* 13
i'm not, in part because we have to do our cost-benefit analysis. %$* 645
we have to ask if that's true, is it worth it? %$* 645
the costs have been 2.5 million people in prison, the costs have been one in three young black men with a criminal case, more african-american young men in prison than in college. %$* 645
the cost has been billions of dollars that we can't afford, money away from our schools, away from our healthcare system, going straight to prison. %$* 645
so especially if we understand that those are people who are locked up for using drugs. %$* 645
i don't have a problem. %$* 645
if you steal, if you rob, then yes, you should be punished. %$* 645
but when we're thinking about people who are locked up, 500,000 people, those are nonviolent drug offenders. %$* 645
and again, entirely selective. %$* 645
they're african-american and latino two-thirds of them. %$* 645
there're some states where 80 to 90 percent of the people in prison for drug crimes are black. %$* 645
and we know that's not the reality of who's using drugs. %$* 645
that's selective law enforcement. %$* 645
asa hutchinson, would you like to respond? %$* 13
well, first, to go along with my partner, that the issue is not our enforcement policies currently, but it's whether we're going to legalize all drugs. %$* 448
that's the issue before us. %$* 448
how can you separate those? %$* 645
well, i think you can-- %$* 448
that's not the debate topic, how you separate those. %$* 448
but in terms-- %$* 448
if you look at oxycontin, it's a white abused drug. %$* 448
if you look at lsd, it's a white abused drug. %$* 448
if you look at cocaine, it's-- %$* 448
you know, crack cocaine has minorities. %$* 448
you've got powder cocaine, that's white abused. %$* 448
you've got heroin that's across the board. %$* 448
you've got ghb, you've got ecstasy that was mentioned. %$* 448
so i just don't see the racial component to it. %$* 448
obviously, i think as head of the-- %$* 448
former head of the dea, we looked at enforcement policy. %$* 448
you've got to be careful. %$* 448
you don't want to-- %$* 448
the south side of chicago put all your enforcement resources on the crack distributor when you're ignoring the white guy coming from the suburb. %$* 448
that's wrong enforcement policies. %$* 448
you've got to balance those. %$* 448
but those are remedies within the current system. %$* 448
legalizing it dramatizes the problem. %$* 448
you still have education issues, as you pointed out, where you have to spend dollars on education, probably even more because you've got more availability out there. %$* 448
you're going to have to spend money on the regulatory side. %$* 448
so all of those issues that are concerned about in society will only increase if you increase legalization. %$* 448
can i ask-- %$* 646
nick gillespie-- %$* 13
i'm going to let you speak, one second. %$* 13
after nick speaks, i'd like to start coming to you in the audience for questions. %$* 13
so just remember, raise your hand. %$* 13
i have a little bit of difficulty seeing people who are towards the back and out of the bright lights, so you might want to come forward. %$* 13
if you raise your hand, i'll call on you, and i mic will come to you, and you can ask a question. %$* 13
nick gillespie. %$* 13
i mean, i'd like too defer to the experience and the expertise of the opposition to legalization. %$* 646
but i'm left wondering what world we're talking about here. %$* 646
so they're talking about how bad oxycontin is. %$* 646
oxycontin is a prescription drug that is already legal and regulated. %$* 646
i don't see how that really has a lot to do with talking about a legalization debate. %$* 646
it's already legal. %$* 646
and here are the stats that are important. %$* 646
the government runs something called the national survey on drug use and health. %$* 646
and basically, 30-- %$* 646
in the past month use, they ask people, have you used this drug in the past 30 days, which is kind of a proxy for, you know, a regular user or a casual user. %$* 646
about 7 percent of people over the ages of 12-- %$* 646
12-year-olds by the way, you know almost a hundred percent, they say yes to everything. %$* 646
but about 7 percent of americans say that they've used pot in the past month. %$* 646
that by far-- %$* 646
by a factor of three or more, that's the most widely used illegal drug, or legal drug that's used illegally. %$* 646
the next one is opioids, the prescription drugs that theodore was talking about, which comes in at 2.7 percent. %$* 646
when you're talking about things like meth and heroin, one- tenth of one percent. %$* 646
hallucinogens covering a wide range of things, five-tenths of one percent. %$* 646
crack or cocaine, including crack, six-tenths of one percent. %$* 646
these are nonfactors. %$* 646
and as paul was suggesting, if they're made legal, who out here is going to be like, finally, heroin is legal, you know? %$* 646
you know, let's go. %$* 646
let's try it. %$* 646
no. %$* 646
okay, that's not going to happen. %$* 646
it's about pot. %$* 646
and we all know that pot is not a dangerous drug, that pot is not a gateway anymore than mother's milk, you know, is the ultimate gateway drug because everybody who uses heroin started out with mother's milk. %$* 646
but it's about pot, and we need to focus on that. %$* 646
i actually wanted to-- %$* 13
it's not an issue then-- %$* 645
i want to hear the-- %$* 13
i want to hear your opponents respond to the notion of whether drug use overall would soar if it were legalized. %$* 13
well, no one can say with any absolute certainty. %$* 647
well, i know, but-- %$* 13
but all one can say-- %$* 647
i don't know what to say to someone who tells me that the deaths of 15,000 people a year is not really a problem-- %$* 647
the incarceration of 500,000 people, you know, that's about how-- %$* 646
let him make his point and-- %$* 13
hang on. %$* 647
and 2 million people being addicted to it. %$* 647
so it is actually an important point that if you make something readily available, the use of it can increase catastrophically. %$* 647
now, i can't, of course, say, that i know for a fact if methamphetamine were just available like everything else, or crack were available, you just went down and got it, of course not everybody would take it. %$* 647
but i have an experience. %$* 647
and this was an experience working in africa with some expatriates. %$* 647
and for various reasons i won't go into, alcohol became-- %$* 647
virtually free of charge. %$* 647
and the result was absolutely catastrophic. %$* 647
the increase in the consumption was enormous. %$* 647
and, of course, not-- %$* 647
in fact, the majority of people didn't take it to extremes. %$* 647
but 20 percent of people did. %$* 647
asa, your partner wants to join in on this point, i think. %$* 13
i agree. %$* 448
i think logic tells you usage goes up. %$* 448
but recent information, alaska, through a court case, decriminalized marijuana in the 70s. %$* 448
usage went up. %$* 448
parents were concerned, and they voted to recriminallize it in the '90s. %$* 448
that's a historic experience among our states. %$* 448
and so usage did go up, and parents recognized that and reversed the trend in alaska. %$* 448
this debate is not about marijuana. %$* 448
it is drugs, plural. %$* 448
and to be consistent in your philosophy of libertarianism, which my colleagues are consistent, they recognize it doesn't do any good to legalize one. %$* 448
you have to legalize all. %$* 448
and if you-- %$* 448
because that's the only way you're going to change the environment of enforcement, to change the environment of police and so on. %$* 448
and so the debate tonight is about legalizing all drugs. %$* 448
all right. %$* 13
let's go to some questions from the audience. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are now in the question-and-answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, who are arguing it out over this motion: â€œlegalize drugs," and, ma'am, right in the center, there. %$* 13
if you look to your right, there's a microphone coming down. %$* 13
if you could just stand up and tell us your name, thanks. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
hi. %$* 13
patsy cohn paul butler mentioned smoking, and i have a question, the laws in new york have gotten so much more stringent against smoking. %$* 19
you can't smoke in the parks, you certainly cannot smoke in a restaurant or a bar, and taxes on cigarettes have gone up significantly. %$* 19
so your argument would be that none of that affects people lowering the smoking rate, that, in fact, it's only health issues, and i would wonder what the statistics are on that. %$* 19
all right, i'm not going to hold them to knowing the statistics, because they might not know, and it would just be embarrassing. %$* 13
but let's take on your larger principle. %$* 13
so-- %$* 645
paul butler. %$* 13
i am concerned about this nanny state that the government is creating where we can't have-- %$* 645
it started with certain drugs, and it seems to be going down the road to trans fats, right, to smoking in parks, smoking tobacco in parks, and even big gulp cans of soda. %$* 645
so if we buy this idea that people aren't responsible enough to make intelligent decisions for themselves, which my opponents don't seem to think people are, we ought to be concerned about these draconian laws, and we ought to especially be concerned about who they're going to be applied against. %$* 645
i guarantee you that white people-- %$* 645
very few white people in new york are going to be arrested for smoking in parks. %$* 645
it's going to be african-americans and latinos. %$* 645
that's the reality. %$* 645
we can't divorce the reality from this rhetoric. %$* 645
response from the other side. %$* 13
well, i think the-- %$* 647
theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
fact is that people stopped smoking in bars because there was a law against it and they did it on a certain day. %$* 647
they didn't suddenly realize that their health would be impaired by it. %$* 647
and interestingly, this happened throughout the world. %$* 647
my wife, who's french, said, "the french will never obey this law," but they obeyed it like lambs. %$* 647
and so-- %$* 647
and the reason, of course, is that smoking doesn't have the antinomian cultural meaning that taking drugs has, and that's why smokers will obey the law and others won't. %$* 647
sir. %$* 13
i'd like to understand a bit-- %$* 648
would you mind standing up? %$* 13
sorry. %$* 648
and tell us your name. %$* 13
my name is bob wyman. %$* 648
i'd like to understand a bit more, mr. %$* 648
hutchinson, the comments you made about that we can't legalize one without essentially legalizing them all, that it's not useful. %$* 648
but historically we have legalized one very major one, and that is alcohol. %$* 648
and then we have a-- %$* 648
sort of a regulation as well with cigarettes. %$* 648
and then there are the various legal drugs that doctors can give you. %$* 648
we've already gone down that path, and we've seen that, for instance, the legalization of alcohol didn't cause a tremendous explosion in heroin use. %$* 648
why wouldn't legalizing just one more, say, going with heroin, that's a-- %$* 648
not heroin, but-- %$* 648
but going with marijuana-- %$* 648
got to pick the right one. %$* 648
why wouldn't going one step further and thus removing the tremendous amount of people who are in jail for that and all the money that's going to the criminals why wouldn't that be used-- %$* 648
yeah, asa hutchinson. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
very good question, and i did not explain it well, so i'm glad you asked that. %$* 448
and you're right. %$* 448
we're a democracy so you could-- %$* 448
society could choose to legalize heroin if you wish or marijuana and pick one of them. %$* 448
but my argument would be generally people say, "well, one of the reason we need to legalize, because you got to put the cartels out of business. %$* 448
and you've got to put the criminal elements out of business." well, they're smart business folks, and they have diversified. %$* 448
so if you legalize marijuana, they're going to trade in cocaine, methamphetamine, and they will market those. %$* 448
and so if-- %$* 448
unless you legalize everything, the cartels are just happy as a lark. %$* 448
and even if you legalized everything, you're probably still going to have the black market they will deal in although it'll be tougher. %$* 448
but the second point is simply that the debate topic is not just about marijuana, it is broad based legalization because-- %$* 448
well, that's the debate topic. %$* 448
and that's what we're trying to stick to. %$* 448
asa, if somebody wants to use any of the drugs that are currently illegal, aside from the fact that they're breaking the law, just in terms of the little bubble of their own life, is that anybody's business but their own? %$* 13
is-- %$* 13
in other words, where is the social dimension to that use? %$* 13
well, the social dimension is-- %$* 448
and i hate to keep speaking of methamphetamine, but that's a real problem where i'm from-- %$* 448
and methamphetamine, you are manufacturing it, you've got children around, they're taking the methamphetamine and they're abandoning their kids for weeks on end. %$* 448
and so it's a child welfare issue that is extraordinarily harmful, endangerment of those. %$* 448
it is environmentally unsafe. %$* 448
now, you can say, "well, if we get our nanny state involved where they regulate the-- %$* 448
and license the methamphetamine produces maybe you'll eliminate some of that." but you're still going to have the lack of productivity in the workplace through drug use, and people not showing up because of they arenâ€™t having a good monday morning, as my colleague was pointing out. %$* 448
in your world, for somebody to get help, they have to admit that they're a criminal. %$* 645
no, you can go get treatment any time you want to. %$* 448
and admit that you've broken the law? %$* 645
well, of course, you know that if somebody has a problem with an addiction and they go into a clinic, they're not going to get arrested for it, they're going to get help, and they're going to get treatment. %$* 448
and that's the goal in the workplace too. %$* 448
if you do testing and you find a worker who has got an abuse problem, they're not sending them to the police, they're sending them to treatment. %$* 448
and that's the objective of the employers, and that's working well in the workplace. %$* 448
and all of that effort would be abandoned if you went through legalization. %$* 448
all of the sudden, you-- %$* 448
why would you drug test anybody? %$* 448
that's a good question. %$* 646
why do we now? %$* 646
because most people who get drug tested, you get drug tested when you're applying for a job and that's it. %$* 646
it's a joke. %$* 646
it's a hurdle to weed out people who-- %$* 646
you know, on other grounds. %$* 646
the people-- %$* 646
they have random drug testing; they test pilots. %$* 448
and i'm glad for the testing of the pilots that fly our airplanes. %$* 448
of course. %$* 646
and what airline, what airline or trucking company, or whatever, is not going to regularly test people, because it puts them at enormous insurance risk? %$* 646
these things are handled and-- %$* 646
to talk about another market mechanism, we don't need-- %$* 646
and this is the libertarian in me speaking, we don't need the government to test and testify to the purity of methamphetamine, we will have fair trade methamphetamine-- %$* 646
you know, private certification agencies, just like with coffee or biodynamic wine or organic foods-- %$* 646
will spontaneously spring into being. %$* 646
and, just to follow up on one point, the reason why i'm stressing marijuana, it goes back to some things that paul is saying, and i don't think that the other side is fully acknowledging, which is that we live in a world where school kids tell everybody who asks them, "you know, you can get drugs easier than you can get beer, any kind of drug you want." the use ratios are pot, very much-- %$* 646
much less, prescription drugs, and these tiny vanishing statistical errors of things like heroin. %$* 646
even if you double or triple the heroin use, it goes from-- %$* 646
one-tenth of 1 percent to three- tenths of 1 percent. %$* 646
i don't think that's a reason to hold everyone else hostage who can act responsibly. %$* 646
i was going to go to another question, but do you want to dispute the numbers? %$* 13
well, in terms of the numbers, if you're looking at marijuana use in the schools, and the availability of it, i just come back to the fundamental question. %$* 448
if you legalize it, two things happen: one, the kids say, "if it's legal for my folks, how can it be harmful? %$* 448
" the government says it's legal now; that's a signal that it's okay and usage goes up because of that-- %$* 448
nobody thinks that about tobacco. %$* 645
nobody thinks tobacco is okay because it's legal. %$* 645
hate speech is legal, kids don't say, "oh, now i can engage in hate speech." i think, you know, i, again, you know-- %$* 646
wait, wait. %$* 13
asa was-- %$* 13
were you in mid-flow? %$* 13
and then i'll come back to that, because â€“ %$* 13
no, i'm happy to take another question. %$* 448
no, i'm just saying that, you know, fundamentally, look-- %$* 646
we don't live in a democracy, by the way; we live in a limited republican form of government which respects the rights of the minority. %$* 646
but i don't think anybody in america mistakes the idea that something is allowed with something being good. %$* 646
and if they are, then we really need to change the public education system because the kids are getting the wrong message. %$* 646
but the point that asa made that if kids see that they're parents are smoking dope or-- %$* 13
or drinking-- %$* 646
all right, but make it drinking. %$* 13
you don't think that there's a lesson %$* 13
no, actually, what i would suggest is that when you see your parents and other adults using a drug responsibly, and we need to keep coming back to this point, drug use does not equal drug abuse. %$* 646
those are two very separate things, and we can deal with them. %$* 646
but when you see your parents having a glass of wine with dinner and acting responsibly around an intoxicant, you learn a very strong lesson there that is going to be much more beneficial to you than if you grow up in a teetotaler house and then you have the unfortunate experience of going to yale and harvard like paul here. %$* 646
i don't think kids are going to be seeing parents using heroin or methamphetamine or cocaine responsibly. %$* 448
i don't know if kids see the parents use marijuana in the home responsibly, does that increase usage, decrease usage? %$* 448
all i can say, as a parent, i hate to take that experiment. %$* 448
drug use does not equal drug abuse, statement of principle from the other side, from your opponents. %$* 13
so the side arguing against that, what do you make of that? %$* 13
theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
well, that may be perfectly true. %$* 647
but the fact is that it's also true that most drunk drivers get home perfectly safely. %$* 647
99 percent of drunk-- %$* 647
i know, i'm afraid to say, because i've done it myself. %$* 647
have you ever drunk debated, though? %$* 646
yeah, well, you're making an assumption that i'm not now. %$* 647
but-- %$* 647
so, of course, it's perfectly true. %$* 647
but the argument about cigarettes, for example, one hears it all the time, most people who smoke cigarettes don't actually suffer from lung cancer. %$* 647
i mean, i've heard-- %$* 647
i don't know how many times i've heard it, and it's perfectly true, that most people who smoke cigarettes don't die of lung cancer. %$* 647
but the fact is that most people who get lung cancer, and it's very nasty, smoke. %$* 647
and the fact is, again, that i don't think there's any real benefit to be taken from these drugs. %$* 647
and to equate the freedom to take drugs with the freedom of expression seems to me to trivialize what the freedom of expression actually is. %$* 647
ma'am, right against the wall, where the wall turns green. %$* 13
if you could state your name, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 649
diana jiminez. %$* 649
i come from mexico. %$* 649
and in the past six years, we've had 60,000 people dead in drug-related violence. %$* 649
the murder rate has gone down. %$* 649
but in drug- related violence, we've had, you know-- %$* 649
it's just been atrocious. %$* 649
my question is, legalizing drugs would do better for cartel violence or worse? %$* 649
and your question is to either side? %$* 13
yeah, yeah. %$* 19
i want-- %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
let's take it to this side. %$* 13
and i want to-- %$* 13
i'll go to paul butler, since that used to be your job, to a degree. %$* 13
true. %$* 645
and if we listen to the leaders of the latin american countries, they're calling for more responsible drug policies, including for us to consider legalization, because they know that the violence is sparked by the illegal market which is sparked by the enormous demand for drugs from the united states. %$* 645
so if we get rid of that illegal market, including by having drugs regulated like we regulate tobacco and alcohol now, we'll get rid of the violence. %$* 645
again, that's exactly what happened during prohibition. %$* 645
al capone wasn't nothing but a drive-by shooter. %$* 645
and again, when we got rid of that illegal market, we got rid of the violence. %$* 645
well, to that point, the answer is absolutely no. %$* 448
did the mafia end in new york city at the conclusion of prohibition? %$* 448
rudy giuliani, the former u.s.attorney, former mayor of new york, made himself famous by prosecuting the mob and the mafia. %$* 448
they existed long after the ending of prohibition. %$* 448
and to the lady's question about mexico, do you think the legalization of drugs will put the cartel out of business? %$* 448
it might make them adjust, but there is alien smuggling which they're engaged in now. %$* 448
there's other activities. %$* 448
but you look at the cost to the united states, i think that would just be enormous. %$* 448
i met with president vicente fox whenever he was president. %$* 448
he was concerned not only about the cartels. %$* 448
he was concerned about the demand-- %$* 448
growing demand problem and usage in mexico of his people. %$* 448
and that was a concern there. %$* 448
and so it's not just about the cartel. %$* 448
it's about drug use. %$* 448
i don't know of any latin american country that wants to legalize all of the drugs, heroin, cocaine, down the road. %$* 448
can i-- %$* 13
nick gillespie, and then i'll come to theodore. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i just wanted to say very quickly, the mob moved into other illegal pursuits, prostitution, non-casino gambling, things like that. %$* 646
and to the extent that the cartels in mexico might move into human trafficking, the fix there is to legalize immigration, not to try and wipe out cartels. %$* 646
that's what i'm saying. %$* 646
and the-- %$* 646
you know, the-- %$* 646
or the generational shift here might be the kennedy clan. %$* 646
and i say this as a half italian, half irish, so i've got, you know, a foot in each camp here. %$* 646
you're covered, yeah. %$* 13
but the kennedys went from having connections in the liquor business within a generation or two, to, you know, moving into politics. %$* 646
harvard and yale again. %$* 13
not a good-- %$* 646
not a good progression. %$* 646
but the fact is, when you legalize broad swaths of economic activity where there is a supply and a demand, peace reigns and prosperity follows. %$* 646
theodore dalrymple. %$* 13
well, i think the idea that mexico, or, for example, colombia would be a peaceful society if it were not for drugs is absolutely ludicrous. %$* 647
if one just takes the example of colombia, there were two episodes in the 20th century in which the equivalent pro rata of the population of more than a million people were killed. %$* 647
that's twice. %$* 647
and the current civil war in colombia started in 1964. i remember in 1979, really before the drug business, i remember looking-- %$* 647
looking in the south american handbook which was the kind of book that everyone used in-- %$* 647
who traveled in south america and it said of bogota-- %$* 647
and i'm quoting from memory, so it might not be quite right. %$* 647
it said, "try to look poor. %$* 647
do not carry anything. %$* 647
do not wear any jewelry. %$* 647
and if you can see without them, do not wear glasses."now, let's say you wouldn't have that in a guide book to switzerland. %$* 647
i mean, more likely, you'd have, "do not flush the lavatory after 10:00 because you'll be arrested for disturbing the peace." and that's not a joke, incidentally. %$* 647
so the idea that these are-- %$* 647
i mean, i've seen another thing that-- %$* 647
well, i think that you've made that point. %$* 13
let me go to the gentleman in the corner. %$* 13
and mic will come to you. %$* 13
you know, if you wouldn't mind, you're in a purple light. %$* 13
and if you took a step three seats down you'll be in a-- %$* 13
in a non-purple light. %$* 13
you just want to look good on television. %$* 13
come out a little bit farther if you don't mind. %$* 13
could you-- %$* 13
step into the light, sir. %$* 13
take your shirt off-- %$* 18
there you go. %$* 13
i've been waiting for you to say that. %$* 18
so my sister is married to a-- %$* 650
what's your name? %$* 13
what's your name? %$* 13
you probably don't want to say now. %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
justin rohrlich %$* 650

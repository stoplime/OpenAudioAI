.hi, my name is, uh, bernie weinraub and i’m the moderator of this, uh, panel. %$* 45
and, um, uh, first of all, i want to say something that i’ve wanted to say for many, many years, and that’s to, uh, please turn off your cell phones and beepers. %$* 45
and unwrap all cellophaned items, because, uh, there’s, there are, um, microphones all around here. %$* 45
and, um, this is going to be broadcast over, um, npr.um, so we have to sort of unwrap any kind of cellophaned items and candy and all that stuff. %$* 45
um, and it would ruin the mood to hear cellophane. %$* 45
um, uh, and i, i’ve been asked to have people come down forward, uh, but i guess you guys are okay. %$* 45
um, i want you guys to, um, get your questions ready for the q&a after the opening statements and not to be shy about asking the panel anything, anything that you want to ask. %$* 45
um, if you want three by five cards to write your questions down, um, the ushers will hand them out. %$* 45
um, now i’m pleased and happy to introduce the man responsible for this debate and all the other debates, robert rosenkranz, who will make some opening remarks. %$* 45
well, good evening and thank you all for being here. %$* 1
i’m robert rosenkranz, chairman of intelligence squared u.s.debate forum, which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation. %$* 1
i’m here with donna wolfe, our executive producer, who has, been with me from the creation of this series. %$* 1
this is the fourth debate of our, uh, fall season. %$* 1
there are going to be four more in, in the spring and probably an even expanded program next year. %$* 1
we’re thrilled that wnyc is, uh, recording this series of debates, producing them as radio programs, which through the good offices of npr, are distributed nationally to a majority of the largest radio markets in the country. %$* 1
um, we also value the sponsorship of the times of london and i especially want to thank our moderator, bernie weinraub, who i will formally introduce momentarily, as well as the extraordinarily able group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s evening. %$* 1
let me begin by saying what’s to, what tonight’s debate is not. %$* 1
it is not, resolved: movies should be censored and their export restricted. %$* 1
it is not, resolved: george w.bush has fueled anti- americanism abroad. %$* 1
rather, it’s about the connection of two pretty clearly indisputable facts. %$* 1
first, that the american entertainment industry, hollywood, has been highly successful in creating a product with deep appeal for a global audience. %$* 1
those, like myself, who have a commitment to free markets and free expression would be hard put not to say, two cheers for hollywood. %$* 1
but why not three cheers? %$* 1
well, because billions of people around the world get their primary impressions of american life and culture from our movies and television shows, which leads us to a second indisputable fact-- %$* 1
a rising tide of anti-american sentiment, particularly in europe and the middle east. %$* 1
it’s challenging for us as americans to understand why the world so often views us differently from the way we view ourselves. %$* 1
with that in mind, the motion tonight is intended to explore what relationship exists, if any, between these two phenomenon. %$* 1
content aside, is hollywood’s dominance of global entertainment perceived as a hated form of cultural imperialism? %$* 1
does the content of hollywood films and television, taken as a whole, reflect a distorted picture of american life? %$* 1
and does this picture matter in terms of the rise of anti-american sentiment? %$* 1
well, let’s see what the evidence shows. %$* 1
i’d now like to introduce our moderator for the evening, bernard weinraub. %$* 1
bernie became, began as a copy boy at the new york times, served abroad for the times in saigon, london, new delhi and washington. %$* 1
in 1990 he moved to los angeles, where he’s been covering hollywood for the new york times until his retirement about a year ago. %$* 1
uh, he recently wrote a play, the accomplice, which will open in new york in march 2007.so i’m happy to be able to plug that. %$* 1
and i’m very pleased now to, uh, hand the evening over to bernie. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 577
thank you. %$* 577
the one, um, thing that i’ve been told that i forgot in the introduction is, um, because we’re going to be on, on npr, um, we’ve gotta sort of, i guess, fake it a little bit and we have to a lou %$* 577
a loud round of applause for npr and for the radio broadcast. %$* 577
so, please, a round of applause. %$* 577
all right, whoo. %$* 577
great. %$* 577
um, let me give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 577
first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 577
the opposition will follow. %$* 577
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go and back from one side to the other. %$* 577
when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks i’ll open the floor to brief questions from the audience. %$* 577
third, when the q&a is complete each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes each. %$* 577
fourth, during the closing arguments ballot boxes will be passed around for voting and you’ll put in either the for piece, the against, the against piece or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side you favor. %$* 577
if anyone doesn’t have a ticket ballot an usher will get you one at the appropriate moment. %$* 577
fifth and last, after the clo %$* 577
after the final closing argument is made, uh, statement is made, i will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day. %$* 577
i will now introduce the panel. %$* 577
for the motion, which is, "hollywood has fueled anti-americanism abroad" – author, commentator, news ana %$* 577
analyst and law professor, james hirsen. %$* 577
now, i’m, i’m going to break my impartiality here-- %$* 577
and i’m not going to do this with anybody else-- %$* 577
except to say that james hirsen, whom i do not know, has a very unusual sidelight to his background. %$* 577
because prior to him becoming, you know, uh, very prominent on fox news and all that stuff, um, he worked as a pro %$* 577
professional musician and for a number of years was a keyboardist for one of the most legendary groups of all times, and one of my favorites – and, uh, it goes way back – the temptations. %$* 577
all right. %$* 577
okay, that’s the big surprise of the evening. %$* 577
next, um, the art critic, essayist, social commentator and co-editor and publisher of the new criterion, roger kimball. %$* 577
resident scholar at the american ent %$* 577
enterprise institute for public policy research, joshua muravchick. %$* 577
against the motion, the executive director of the creative coalition, a social and political ad %$* 577
advocacy organization for the arts and entertainment industry, robin bronk. %$* 577
the film producer, director and political activist, robert greenwald. %$* 577
and writer of fiction, non-fiction and screenplays and chairman of the graduate program in screenwriting at ucla, richard walter. %$* 577
um, now for the motion, um, let’s call up roger kimball. %$* 577
good evening. %$* 578
i’d like to, uh, thank mr. %$* 578
weinraub and bob rosenkranz, uh, dana and all the iq staff, iq2 staff, um, for organizing this event and keeping alive the tradition of civil discourse and debate in new york. %$* 578
um, it’s, it’s a tradition that is, uh, unfortunately, uh, fallen out of favor in recent years. %$* 578
um, now, contemplating the motion before us, that hollywood has fueled anti-americanism abroad, i have to admit that when i first contemplated this i thought of the cartoon strip calvin and hobbs. %$* 578
maybe some of you know this strip. %$* 578
i’m thinking in particular of that, that, uh, cartoon whose first frame shows the little calvin – he’s six years old, quite a demon – hammering, furiously, nails into a board. %$* 578
and then in the second frame calvin’s mother runs into the room, screaming, calvin, what are you doing to the coffee table? %$* 578
in the third frame, calvin looks up with a look of extreme bemusement on his face, saying, is that a trick question? %$* 578
now, we all know that hollywood in its current incarnation, uh, boasts a, a large quotient of anti-americanism. %$* 578
uh, the names matt damon, george clooney, alec baldwin, barbra streisand, michael moore, susan, susan, susan sarandon – the, the list goes on and on. %$* 578
we also know that anti-americanism is alive and well in the world today, alas. %$* 578
now, what is the connection? %$* 578
i want to be clear about what the resolution before us – a resolution, by the way, that i, i hope you will support. %$* 578
it is that hollywood has fueled anti-americanism abroad. %$* 578
this is, this is where it gets tricky. %$* 578
this is not a referendum about the bush administration, the war in iraq or any, uh, evils, real or supposed, of american society. %$* 578
it is a resolution about the effect of hollywood movies and the hollywood mindset on this phenomenon of anti-americanism abroad. %$* 578
now, the first thing to note is that anti-americanism is what we might call a hearty perennial. %$* 578
it does not need hollywood to thrive. %$* 578
it has a long pedigree, born of wealth and power. %$* 578
one thinks of pericles and what he had to say about, uh, the way in which distinction bred envy, envy bred resentment and resentment, if not checked, bred hatred. %$* 578
athens, in her day, was cordially hated. %$* 578
rome, in her day, was cordially hated. %$* 578
so was the british empire. %$* 578
as the authors of that great satire, 1066 and all that, reminded, remind us, after the first world war america emerged as what they called top nation. %$* 578
so it, it assumed the mantle of great britain’s, uh, pre-eminence and it also has passed the scepter, uh, as it were, of the world’s antipathy. %$* 578
and that has been something that’s been pretty constant from that time on. %$* 578
there have been intervening moments of gratitude, after 1918, for example, after 1945, for example. %$* 578
but basically then the world slips back into disliking us. %$* 578
um, so that’s, that’s no, uh, just a kind of common reality which we, which we live with. %$* 578
that’s one form of anti-americanism. %$* 578
in our, in the current form, anti-americanism, i think, was born domestically of the sixties. %$* 578
it’s a product in part of what the literary critic lionel trilling called the adversary culture of the intellectuals – um, fed by the vietnam war, fed by the radicalism of the sixties. %$* 578
we all can remember the students demonstrating in the street, spelling america with a k and so on. %$* 578
um, something more radical happened abroad. %$* 578
but this is not new either. %$* 578
you go back to the carter years. %$* 578
there are plenty of people chanting in the streets, down with the great satan, death to america, burning american flags. %$* 578
same thing in the reagan administration, same thing in the clinton administration. %$* 578
the same thing in both bush administrations. %$* 578
hoards shouting “death to america” is always, seems always to be with us. %$* 578
so anti-americanism, domestic and foreign, is like a, a kind of rank garden. %$* 578
it thrives. %$* 578
hollywood merely supplies a layer of what you might call fructified, fructified manure. %$* 578
anti-americanism abroad would exist without hollywood, just as cancer would exist without cigarette smoke. %$* 578
but hollywood tends to make the malignancy worse. %$* 578
and it does this i think in two ways. %$* 578
one way is what we might call cultural anti-americanism. %$* 578
by making so many trashy, vacuous movies, hollywood uh, fosters a view of american life that is really at odds with the reality of american society. %$* 578
it um, shows this society to be largely sex-obsessed, violence-obsessed, a society shot through with cynicism about its founding institutions. %$* 578
and by and large portrays a decadent society in love with nihilism. %$* 578
that’s one way in which hollywood fuels anti-americanism abroad, by portraying america as a society that has lost its soul. %$* 578
another way and perhaps a more virulent way, a more political way, is the way hollywood, by attacking those institutions of american life uh, shows america to be a bankrupt, corrupt, venal, savage uh, mercenary society. %$* 578
um these, this side of hollywood really sort of took off i think in the 1960s during the vietnam war. %$* 578
is there a vietnam film uh, that shows america as anything other than a horrible, savage, misguided society? %$* 578
maybe one or two. %$* 578
one thinks of the hanoi hilton but of course that was instantly savaged by critics. %$* 578
stanley kaufman, for example, dismissed it as filth. %$* 578
by and large i think any movie that deals with american society from the 1960s on deals with all of the institutions of american life as something not to be admired but to be disparaged. %$* 578
when was the last time you saw the president of the united states in a movie portrayed in a favorable light, or the military? %$* 578
it’s very rare that this happens. %$* 578
oliver stone, i think summed up what, what hollywood is like now when he says “we have become the enemy.” hollywood has fueled anti-americanism abroad to such an extent that for example, german schoolteachers show bowling for columbine by michael moore as an accurate portrayal of american society. %$* 578
one thinks, for example, of the movie syriana which blends incomprehensibility with anti-american animists to an extraordinary extent. %$* 578
charles krauthammer said that this movie could have been scripted by osama bin laden and i believe that movies like this, that the general spirit of hollywood today actively fuels anti-americanism abroad. %$* 578
and i hope that you will support that motion. %$* 578
thank you. %$* 578
okay, against, we have richard walter. %$* 577
thank you. %$* 579
you hear it all the time: hollywood films are corrosive, destructive, decaying. %$* 579
you hear it all, all the time. %$* 579
you hear it from our noble opponents here and you hear it in right- wing talk radio shows. %$* 579
i guess that’s a redundancy if ever there was one. %$* 579
um i just wonder if it, it worries our friends even just a little bit to find themselves in lock step agreement with osama bin laden. %$* 579
the fact of the matter is there are a lot of bad movies out there. %$* 579
there are also a lot of bad paintings, a lot of bad sculpture. %$* 579
you know, most art sucks, excuse me. %$* 579
but here in new york, i stopped in at the metropolitan museum, my favorite museum in the world. %$* 579
and i didn’t see one work of art that wasn’t worthy. %$* 579
and you get the impression in museums that all art is fantastic, is beautiful, is wonderful. %$* 579
when in fact, for every one of those paintings at the museums, there are thousands, indeed tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands that just don’t deserve to be there. %$* 579
with film, because it’s contemporary, even more so in, in television, with television, we don’t have the time to do the culling and the selecting where the best kind of falls away, drops away. %$* 579
people like to look back at the forties and the thirties and say, why don’t they make great films like they did back then? %$* 579
the fact is they made a lot of lousy movies back then as well. %$* 579
i think in 2060 they’ll be saying, why don’t they make great films like they did back there at the beginning of the new millennium? %$* 579
we hear about sex and violence in films as if this was invented by hollywood. %$* 579
the fact is, dramatic narrative has always been brutal, always been ugly, always been bloody and sexual. %$* 579
oedipus rex, he kills his father. %$* 579
you know what he does to his mother. %$* 579
he pokes his eyes out with jagged, rusty spikes. %$* 579
medea murders her own children in a jealous rage against her philandering and faithless husband jason. %$* 579
uh, not just the greeks but shakespeare. %$* 579
i'm talking now about the greatest, most venerated, most honorable, the most loved dramatic expression of all time. %$* 579
hamlet ends up with nine corpses on the stage. %$* 579
we counted them up in class. %$* 579
some of them had been run through on swords, some of them had been poisoned. %$* 579
macbeth kills his own king who is a guest in his house, and he does it out of pure ambition, out of pure greed. %$* 579
richard iii killed his own nephews who were boys, nine and eleven years old. %$* 579
um, this was not invented by eleven jews at paramount studios a couple of weeks ago last thursday. %$* 579
this is the way dramatic uh, expression operates. %$* 579
it’s all about conflict, and uh, you know nobody wants to see the village of the happy nice people. %$* 579
rational discourse, even handed discussion has its place, for example right here. %$* 579
but art is not it. %$* 579
certainly dramatic art is, is not it. %$* 579
now what you hear about hollywood all the time is crass commercialism, all they care about is, is making money. %$* 579
oh hollywood just obsesses about the bottom line. %$* 579
now, hollywood care about the bottom line? %$* 579
of course it does, but what business doesn’t? %$* 579
that’s not unique to the entertainment business. %$* 579
the dry cleaner at the corner has to make the bottom line. %$* 579
the insurance business has to meet the bottom line, manufacturing, uh, construction. %$* 579
if you don’t make the bottom line, you're out of business. %$* 579
everything stands on the bottom line, that’s why it’s called the bottom line. %$* 579
and hollywood’s interest in the bottom line is no different from any other business enterprise. %$* 579
and it’s interesting to me that people who consider themselves conservatives and very pro-business, not what i believe is america’s greatest business, which is information and entertainment, which is what i mean when we talk metaphorically about this thing uh, called hollywood. %$* 579
so really there is, there’s absolutely nothing unique to that. %$* 579
i think what the problem is has a lot to do with the fact that we are so now inundated with images. %$* 579
we see so much media everywhere you go, even a man at a urinal, excuse me again, will see advertising. %$* 579
i’ve even seen digital screens. %$* 579
um, a guy my age has plenty of time, let me tell you to look at all of that stuff. %$* 579
and we can’t tell any longer the difference between what’s real and what’s not. %$* 579
there’s no more east and west. %$* 579
you go to beijing and you can be in, in uh, you know, at banana republic and j.crew. %$* 579
there’s no more men and women, that is to say, women do what men used to do and vice versa. %$* 579
uh, no more renters and landlords. %$* 579
i know there are but in another generation it was, it, it, it was like that. %$* 579
now it really, for many of us, maybe most of us in this room, it is not. %$* 579
i think people can’t tell the difference any longer between images and the actual things that the images represent. %$* 579
i was approached by a boxing, the management for a boxer, a very famous prizefighter. %$* 579
it doesn’t matter who it is, his initials are evander holyfield. %$* 579
and they wanted him to move into an acting career and they were looking for material because i see a lot of new screenplays by a lot of new writers. %$* 579
and they wanted, they warned me though, they cautioned me that he considers himself a very religious man and a role model for young men and therefore he refuses to be seen in a movie that depicts him as causing damage, as causing harm to anybody. %$* 579
a prizefighter. %$* 579
i mean he’s made, he’s made his living, he’s achieved his fame, he has a management team that’s able to approach the professor because he has literally beat men into unconsciousness with his fist. %$* 579
and this is not a diatribe against the fight game. %$* 579
god forgive me, i love a great prizefight. %$* 579
in los angeles, it’s now impossible to, it’s illegal to own a lookalike replica handgun. %$* 579
you can’t tell if it’s real or not. %$* 579
it could be used in a crime. %$* 579
a real one that can actually blow your brains out is absolutely legal. %$* 579
i, i hold this up to you as an example of how people no longer can tell the difference between symbols of things and the things that these symbols represent. %$* 579
and likewise, lets look to anti-american sentiment abroad. %$* 579
what could be causing that? %$* 579
it couldn't be the ruinous policies of this recent administration. %$* 579
it’s got to be hollywood movies. %$* 579
so much easier to, to believe that. %$* 579
i must tell you i’ve traveled all around the world, i'm privileged to travel all the world and, and to lecture on screen writing issues and talk to film development corporations. %$* 579
and we are very much loved all around the world. %$* 579
i had the privilege of teaching masters classes last spring in paris and london and imagine my good fortune that i could stand in front of you and actually truthfully pronounce that, that sentence to you. %$* 579
and in the lobby of the conservatoire in paris, there are two dozen posters of movies all around the room. %$* 579
and this is in mean old america-loathing france. %$* 579
and twenty-one of the movies are hollywood movies, are american films. %$* 579
only three of them were french films. %$* 579
the truth is we are loved all around the world for our, our film. %$* 579
the films show that we’re an open society. %$* 579
do we want to go back as jim suggested in the piece that i read to the good ol’ days when everybody was white and women knew their place? %$* 579
i don't think so. %$* 579
thank you very, very much. %$* 579
okay, now for the motion, joshua muravchick. %$* 577
i was going to tell you a great joke to start off with but there’s not enough time, so just laugh please. %$* 580
i want, i'm going to start off with a movie that i enjoyed very much and that made me laugh a lot, uh forty ideas ago. %$* 580
but i think it symbolizes a great deal of the problem which we’re speaking about, and that was the movie dr. %$* 580
strangelove. %$* 580
the thesis of that movie was that the american nuclear arms and american armament in general was not driven by any real danger to our country but was rather driven by the militarism, chauvinism, paranoia of american officials, even with some bizarre root or connection in nazi germany. %$* 580
and this film in fact symbolized a thesis about the cold war and america’s role in it that was believed by many americans, but even more by foreigners, and that was propagated again and again by hollywood films, namely that the two parties to the cold war were equally guilty, equally afraid of one another. %$* 580
they were like two scorpions in a bottle. %$* 580
unlike most historical interpretations, this was one where we’re able to find out at the end the truth of falsity. %$* 580
that is, we found out it was utterly false. %$* 580
we found this out in 1989 when there came to the fore in the soviet union a ruler, gorbachev, who no longer wanted to wage cold war against united states. %$* 580
and the moment that he stepped forward and was prepared to solve the issues of which we were at odds and to uh, and to stop being competitors, the cold war ended instantly because it never was an equally two sided war. %$* 580
it was a war of offense on the other side, aggression on one side and, and defense on the other. %$* 580
a uh, a point that was consistently misrepresented by hollywood. %$* 580
still worse than that kind of moral equivalence that you could see again and again in films were people who, whom there were many in hollywood. %$* 580
and uh, whose ideas were represented in many films, that said in fact, we were the bad guys. %$* 580
and the good guys in the cold war were the uncle joe stalin and the soviet union and his heirs, the emblematic figure of this view of the world was lillian hellman, who was a communist but pretended not to be. %$* 580
and who uh, and who in fact even once, wrote a film called song of russia. %$* 580
and the film song of russia, mr. %$* 580
walter, was exactly a film portraying a village of the happy nice people. %$* 580
except this village of the happy nice people was a collective farm which in fact in reality was a form of uh, death dealing slave labor. %$* 580
but brought to the screen in hollywood as a kind of a, a brady bunch lifestyle, speaking russian. %$* 580
this, but hellman was far from alone in this. %$* 580
in fact the view that supported the other side in the cold war was widespread in hollywood. %$* 580
and in fact, a subsequent mythology was created and is perpetuated to this day by hollywood about the reaction against this support for the other side in the cold war. %$* 580
that is, we hear a lot about and we still to this day, hear about the hollywood ten who have been presented in one after another hollywood film over the decades, including this decade as ten idealistic, humanitarian liberals who were persecuted by the authoritarian state of the united states with the consistent obfuscation or outright denial of the now documented fact that all ten of these hollywood ten were communist party members, and were themselves engaged in a collective effort to blacklist and suppress people who were anti- communist and prevent them from advancing their careers in hollywood. %$* 580
but you don’t have to love stalin to hate america, and in a later era we got people who made famous and popular hollywood films that hated america without loving stalin, of whom the emblematic example is oliver stone, who created these various films of paranoid fantasies, purported to be actual history. %$* 580
and, and one of which the murder of president kennedy was a coup plotted by vice president johnson, and another which has implied that the murder of president kennedy was in fact carried out by president nixon or inspired by president nixon. %$* 580
elsewhere, mr. %$* 580
stone has told us that the murder of the president’s brother, robert kennedy, was carried out by the fbi.and when you look around the world and see in places like the middle east the kind of paranoid, bizarre theories about 9/11 or other things that go on in the world, these are things that i think in all likelihood are fed and encouraged by these very popular presentations in american films, by the likes of oliver stone, which in fact are just as far fetched as the theory that four thousand jews didn’t show up to work at the world trade center on 9/11.as i said, mr. %$* 580
stone parades as if he’s a historian. %$* 580
other hollywood film makers are much more modest and don’t pretend to be making anything other than entertainment. %$* 580
and yet if you watch the uh, the thriller genre in recent years, you see that there’s a kind of set pattern that reappears again and again and again. %$* 580
that is, well as you go along in the film and you find out who is the real evil force at the inner sanctum behind the bad guys in the film, it is invariably the cia.the pentagon, the president, some aide to the president, or american multinational corporations. %$* 580
this uh, uh, this uh, current, this genre being epitomized recently by syriana that was referred to. %$* 580
but i think the best representation of that is by the remake of the manchurian candidate. %$* 580
manchurian candidate was a film in the fifties which showed someone being manipulated and brainwashed and used for diabolical purposes by the government of communist china, of mao zedong. %$* 580
in the twenty-first century version of the manchurian candidate, it’s no more mao zedong, it’s some multinational corporation vaguely reminiscent of uh, halliburton or the carlyle group. %$* 580
so here we have a new sensibility, that is on the one hand, we have this evil halliburton, carlyle, whatever people who have actually done such terrible things as gouging on contracts that they have fulfilled with the us government. %$* 580
and clearly this is supposed to be more horrible to us now in our new modern sensibility than the government of china of mao zedong. %$* 580
i didn’t hear you say one minute. %$* 580
um, alright my, i'm sorry i didn’t hear you. %$* 580
my closing had to do with the clown prince of anti-americanism, michael moore. %$* 580
but i’ll save it for the question period. %$* 580
josh, it’s time. %$* 577
i didn’t hear you say one minute. %$* 580
i said one minute before. %$* 577
um, alright my, i'm sorry i didn’t hear you. %$* 580
my closing had to do with the clown prince of anti-americanism, michael moore. %$* 580
but i’ll save it for the question period. %$* 580
i said one. %$* 577
um, okay against is robin bronk. %$* 577
i wanted to take ten seconds of my time for a nod to my esteemed colleague, mr. %$* 581
kimball for the ex-, due expression that i hope that we can all take with us, fructifying manure. %$* 581
and i will try and use it in every one of my speeches. %$* 581
has hollywood fueled anti- americanism abroad? %$* 581
where’s the evidence that we should be asking this question at all? %$* 581
yes, there’s a lot of anti- americanism, yes hollywood exists. %$* 581
but where’s the connection? %$* 581
what’s the cause and effect? %$* 581
we have the peoples, we have people’s responses to why they’ve become anti-american in the past few years. %$* 581
none of them mention hollywood. %$* 581
what’s the problem with the data? %$* 581
now if you were to posit hollywood as the problem, even though there is no data to support this thesis, what would be the tipping point? %$* 581
in other words, hollywood has been around since the early twentieth century. %$* 581
anti-americanism has peaked in recent years. %$* 581
and in a way we last saw during the vietnam war. %$* 581
would anyone wish to argue that hollywood has fundamentally changed in the past six years? %$* 581
what films would you point to, to support the contention? %$* 581
well if you didn’t like fahrenheit 911, what about flight 92 and the spade of extremely patriotic movies that have recently come out? %$* 581
men of honor, thirteen days, saving private ryan, patriot. %$* 581
well of course hollywood releases lots of different kinds of films. %$* 581
but where has any reputable study anywhere found a direct tie between the kinds of films being produced at the given moment and a rising anti-american sentiment around the world? %$* 581
in fact, the opposite appears true. %$* 581
hollywood is frequently what appeals to foreigners about america, even those who detest our foreign policy. %$* 581
it’s called show business. %$* 581
hollywood studios are owned by global multinational conglomerates whose goal is to maximize their shareholder value. %$* 581
they do this by trying to produce a product, a product that will appeal to the widest possible audience. %$* 581
to do this, they must do their respective best to appeal to the most broad marketplace, here and abroad. %$* 581
and unless you believe that hollywood is run by a conspiracy, then all hollywood is doing is reflecting the values of the people to whom it seeks to appeal. %$* 581
now if you would argue, again, absent any data or evidence of any kind, that this somehow increases the incidence of anti- americanism, then what you're really arguing is that american values and the values of the global marketplace are the cause of anti-americanism. %$* 581
and if that’s the case, and i would contend that it’s not, then you're really objecting both to capitalism itself and to the way that americans like to think of themselves as citizens and consumers. %$* 581
that sounds kind of anti-american to me, and moreover, it sounds like you're shooting the messenger. %$* 581
in america against the world, how we are different and why we are disliked, based on ninety-one thousand interviews conducted in fifty nations from 2002 to 2005 by the pew research center, the authors write that “while the first hints that the world was becoming troubled by america came soon after the election of george w.bush, and that whatever global goodwill the united states has in the wake of the september 11th attacks appears to have quickly dissipated after the iraq invasion. %$* 581
favorable opinions had more than slipped. %$* 581
they had plummeted.” and it’s grown worse since may when that was published. %$* 581
the most recent pew finding showed that favorable opinions of the us had gone from eighty-three percent in 2000 to fifty-six percent in 2006 in britain, seventy-eight to thirty-seven in germany, sixty-two to thirty nine in france. %$* 581
when one looks at the results of these surveys, you see tremendous international opposition to the war in iraq and america’s policies on global warming. %$* 581
if you speak with foreign leaders, you hear genuine concerns about specific aspects of us foreign policy, the refusal to agree with the kyoto treaty and global warming. %$* 581
the withdrawal from the international criminal court, the war in iraq, difficulty getting visas to visit the united states. %$* 581
perhaps i'm looking at the wrong polls or talking with the wrong foreigners. %$* 581
but i’ve yet to hear anyone mention everybody loves raymond reruns as the fuel feeding the anti-american fire raging across so much of the globe. %$* 581
and that’s leading the whole world to, i was going to say that word but i guess i can’t say that word since this is on npr but that’s a different uh, subject. %$* 581
taking to that place down below in a hand basket. %$* 581
thank you. %$* 577
okay now um, for, we have james hirsen. %$* 577
now that pew poll that uh, was cited by robin, uh, i have to say has some statistical problems because in terms of france, germany, and britain, they over-sampled the muslim population, sampling them at levels close to fifty percent. %$* 582
and that accounts a great, for a great deal of the change. %$* 582
when considering this motion, whether you're going to support it, the real question is whether the america that you see in the generic hollywood that constitutes television shows and movies and music, is the same america that we all live in and work in. %$* 582
i mean what if your only glimpse of the united states was the latest report of britney spears, lindsay lohan, and paris hilton and their boycott of underpants? %$* 582
um in nations around the globe, there are lots of people who have never been to the united states. %$* 582
now richard walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do so, but there’s lots of people that have not. %$* 582
and they’ve never come here, they’ve never met you. %$* 582
and so their only impression is the export of the pop culture by the hollywood community. %$* 582
and that includes all of this product. %$* 582
it includes television, and music, and movies. %$* 582
uh, an appearance on the view by danny devito. %$* 582
and once upon a time, as richard walter alluded to talking about the thirties and forties in hollywood, there’s a nickname for this, it’s called a golden age. %$* 582
it’s for a reason because iconic images were sent around the world, images of henry fonda, images of clark gable, images of john wayne. %$* 582
and the world fell in love with america, and they fell in love with those hollywood images. %$* 582
and there was a, a set of values. %$* 582
there was optimism and there was courage. %$* 582
and there was unshakable belief in freedom, and unshakable belief in fairness. %$* 582
to, to show you how much it shifted um, in the period, is it, john wayne who was made into the symbol of america by director john ford, the cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true. %$* 582
we move forward to 1969 when the first film that was x-rated wins the best picture. %$* 582
uses the name cowboy, it’s midnight cowboy. %$* 582
and here the cowboy’s profession is relegated to that of a male prostitute. %$* 582
the cowboys uh, follow in the long way. %$* 582
but things continued in what roger kimball called the cultural anti- americanism. %$* 582
since the 1960s, that what people see around the world is an america of extreme violence, of rampant crime, of unapologetic narcissism, of licentious exhibitionism, and self- loathing. %$* 582
and this is misshapen. %$* 582
it’s distorted. %$* 582
it’s a place where even tony soprano would run to his therapist. %$* 582
and look at rap lyrics. %$* 582
i mean rap lyrics %$* 582
not all of it, but a lot of it, have themes of assaulting women, dealing drugs, killing the police. %$* 582
in many cases—well, actually, almost all cases—women are described either as female dogs, or garden utensils. %$* 582
and the—and the export of this pop culture has increased. %$* 582
um, multiplexes were built in europe, and, uh, the, the exports have gone up to a level of 40—to 50 percent of film box office, is on foreign shores. %$* 582
that includes the films that my colleagues brought up, uh, syriana and michael moore’s fahrenheit 9/11 which has been very popular in the afghan case. %$* 582
um, america’s recent film exports, though, took the idea of artistic license in relation to violent scenes to a whole new level. %$* 582
we have a whole new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad, and they deal with nothing but %$* 582
sadistic, senseless, sickening torture. %$* 582
i’m talking about films like hostel, which did $33 million abroad, the saw series, there’s three of them, they did $160 million abroad. %$* 582
these films, hostel’s plot is a group of young people who are traveling, who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment. %$* 582
there’s no plot. %$* 582
and they lead our neighbors abroad to believe, that america is deviant, and despicable and violent. %$* 582
it’s no wonder that, we have, uh, heard this nickname of israel as “the little satan” by some of the people we’re fighting against, and they call us “the great satan.” as a matter of fact, uh, robin referred to studies %$* 582
this isn’t a poll but it certainly is an event when, right after 9/11 one month later, angry mobs went to the local cinemas, and burnt down five of them that contained american films. %$* 582
i guess they gave it a thumbs-down. %$* 582
the, uh %$* 582
the, the other aspect of hollywood that’s very disturbing, is the way representatives of free enterprise are depicted. %$* 582
business people, executives, and corporations. %$* 582
um, you know, i—i would expect that in a town that, that writes scripts that every once in a while we’d see, uh, a corporate executive as a villain. %$* 582
but it’s almost always that way. %$* 582
oliver stone made wall street, named his main character gekko, and he extolled the virtues of greed. %$* 582
in syriana, as, um %$* 582
you know, uh, my colleagues have brought up, which, by the way, george clooney used the charlize theron formula to win an oscar. %$* 582
that’s you pack up the—pack on the pounds and then pick up an oscar. %$* 582
and in, in that film, there’s a business executive with a suit that explains anti-americanism. %$* 582
explains the reason america is successful, he says, “corruption is why we win.” hollywood hasn’t even left their remakes alone. %$* 582
when they remade the fugitive, all of a sudden they have to have a pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed man that was not in the original television show. %$* 582
uh, my colleague, uh, josh brought up the manchurian candidate. %$* 582
which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian government, into a corporation. %$* 582
the manchurian corporation, what do they manufacture? %$* 582
so apparently in hollywood wealth is taken for granted, it’s a zero-sum game, a finite pie, where if one person wins, then another loses. %$* 582
uh, last year, there was a remake of a famous american symbol. %$* 582
superman. %$* 582
and superman has always been associated with the phrase, “truth, justice, and the american way.” and if you went to the film, you noticed, there was no american way, or it was taken out. %$* 582
and maybe that’s because, hollywood has manufactured a new american way that does not fit with either truth, or justice. %$* 582
one minute. %$* 577

okay, and robert greenwald. %$* 577
thank you. %$* 583
somehow it seems that, um %$* 583
our panelists, some of our panelists have the notion, that the only america people around the world see, is the one in movies and television. %$* 583
do they truly believe, that these people all over the world are idiots and morons, who have no idea what is going on with this horrific war? %$* 583
do they really believe that over and over again it’s a hollywood movie, rather than the killings, the terrorism, the bombings %$* 583
the friends, the relatives, the relatives that people know, who are being %$* 583
subjected %$* 583
and dying in this horrific situation? %$* 583
do they really think that an hour in front of a tv set counters all of the news, and all of the tv reports, and all of the paper reports? %$* 583
truly hard for me to imagine. %$* 583
does josh really think that the war that he advocated for has less of an effect on people than watching a movie? %$* 583
or that if we follow his lead and go to war with iran, that that will in any way %$* 583
any way do anything but continue to destroy the country that we love? %$* 583
the country that oliver stone loves? %$* 583
the country that michael moore loves? %$* 583
the people in the community in los angeles who love, we may disagree with them, but the notion that we say they hate america, is one i personally find disgusting. %$* 583
let me go back to 9/11 for a minute. %$* 583
we all remember %$* 583
i was not in new york, many of you were here, the terrible time, the tragedy. %$* 583
and then this amazing, amazing outpouring, around the world. %$* 583
embracing us. %$* 583
supporting us. %$* 583
offering help to us. %$* 583
the spectrum of countries who came forward and wanted to be with us at this time was truly something to behold. %$* 583
we know it from the information, we know it from the news sources, people i’m sure here have individual stories, when you would call somebody from another country and what they would say and how they would reach out to us. %$* 583
and then that changed, right? %$* 583
and then to use the pew study which we can argue about endlessly but i think you’re totally wrong on the over-sampling issue. %$* 583
to use the pew study again we saw, after the iraq war, a big drop, right? %$* 583
turkey went from 52% of the country supporting us to 12%.britain, our ally, 83% to 56%.and jordan from 20% to 1% had supported us, and now, over a period of years were no longer. %$* 583
well, i’m absolutely sure that the reason for that was ocean’s 11.that’s exactly the reason, or maybe it was shrek, no, i think maybe it was shrek, that caused that terrible fall-off to happen. %$* 583
that really would explain the statistical drop, right? %$* 583
i mean, it makes perfect sense. %$* 583
this was a war of choice %$* 583
that our country went into. %$* 583
the world was opposed to us in the world—in this war of choice. %$* 583
now people can argue we still should’ve done it. %$* 583
but we know the world was opposed to this war of choice. %$* 583
we invaded, we went in, we occupied a country in the middle east with oil resources. %$* 583
and now, pew study again, in 14 out of 16 countries, a majority think the world has been made less safe because of that war. %$* 583
i’m sure that those facts are due to spider man. %$* 583
there’s no question that that must have been the reason that people changed their thinking. %$* 583
or maybe it was in men in black, i think that probably would’ve made the case more effectively. %$* 583
the war goes on, it continues, the polling numbers around the world continue to get worse and worse for the country we love, for the country we care about. %$* 583
america is not trusted around the world. %$* 583
and as a patriot, that’s a terrible, terrible thing. %$* 583
and that’s not because of any fantasy tv program. %$* 583
that’s not because of a trashy, crappy, awful movie that hollywood’s made and %$* 583
i’ve occasionally made some of those movies. %$* 583
that’s not the reason and we know that and i think any rational, sensible, thinking person knows where that comes from. %$* 583
it comes from reality. %$* 583
hollywood is fantasy, gentlemen. %$* 583
hollywood makes up stuff. %$* 583
but there’s a reality out there that trumps any kind of bad screenwriter, or salacious material, there’s a reality that’s facing people all over the world, day in and day out. %$* 583
and we have to look at that reality. %$* 583
we have to embrace and deal with the truth of what’s in front of us. %$* 583
this is a diversion. %$* 583
this is, uh, it’s not—it’s beyond shooting the messenger. %$* 583
this is trying to find some simple little answer, rather than looking at, truly, a terrible, terrible situation, which is going to take us amazing years and time and effort, to overcome. %$* 583
which is this rising and increasing tide of anti-americanism. %$* 583
and the united states says we’re not in favor of the world court. %$* 583
and it refuses to sign the global warming agreement. %$* 583
and we hear about abu ghraib. %$* 583
and in britain, 41% of the country says the us is a greater threat than iran. %$* 583
this is not because of barbra streisand. %$* 583
this is not because of sean penn. %$* 583
this is not because of the happy feet movie. %$* 583
i think that, we must remind ourselves over and over again, what hollywood does, is fiction. %$* 583
let’s make sure that we understand that, let’s put fiction its proper place, yes, it can have some influence on people, yes, you can get annoyed at seeing somebody who’s not acting properly. %$* 583
yes, you can get turned off if there’s free sex or materialism. %$* 583
but is that the reason, compared to this extraordinary situation, again, a war of choice, and a war where we’ve not been able to convince the world for any of the reasons— one minute. %$* 583
we’ve not been able to con—remember, we went to this war, the world’s opposed to us, all kinds of reasons, and we’ve not been able to convince the world of any of those reasons. %$* 583
whatever the reasons of the moment are, from the weapons of mass destruction or al qaeda’s connection to saddam or democracy. %$* 583
and we think hollywood is in any way causing the rise of un-americanism? %$* 583
it, in many ways, defies logic, and defies reason. %$* 583
i urge all of you to vote your rational selves, not to vote a hollywood fantasy scriptwriter who might make up a notion, that yes, some silly movie was going to affect people all over the world, rather than what’s going on today. %$* 583
okay, i want to thank everybody on, um %$* 577
on my right and left. %$* 577
and, um, i’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 577
um, and i got a look at it while you all were talking and this is as %$* 577
this is like the 2000 florida vote, it’s very, very close. %$* 577
before the debate—this is before the debate. %$* 577
40% of you voted for, 35% against, but 25% don’t know. %$* 577
so there’s a lot of “don’t knows,” okay? %$* 577
now %$* 577
we’re now ready to begin the q&a portion of the program, and, and i’ll call on the questioners. %$* 577
i have one question. %$* 577
as the moderator i have the right to at least one question, but i have one. %$* 577
and i have a question for one of the people on my right. %$* 577
just one of them, you can answer. %$* 577
the five biggest films overseas abroad in the last 20 years, maybe longer, 25 years, are %$* 577
titanic, star wars episode 1, e.t., pirates of the caribbean, and lord of the rings. %$* 577
none of these, obviously, are, i mean, are political, none of these %$* 577
have a point of view that could be construed as anti-american. %$* 577
how do you %$* 577
how do you construe that given the argument of %$* 577
of films causing anti-americanism? %$* 577
i’d be glad to respond to that. %$* 580
go ahead. %$* 581
uh— uh, the proposition here is not that all films, uh, are anti-american. %$* 580
but the fact is that one that you didn’t mention that may not have been among the five biggest sellers but that’s tremendously influential in europe is michael moore. %$* 580
michael moore at one given moment, was the author of, uh, three books out of the top six on the best-seller list in germany, number one, two, and six, these books that were based on, on— or that %$* 580
repeat the themes of his movies which, uh, i laughed when i heard robert greenwald say that, that, he loves his country. %$* 580
let me give you a sample of michael moore. %$* 580
“americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet, in thrall to conniving, thieving, smug assholes. %$* 580

let’s welcome our debaters to the stage, we’re about to begin. %$* 13
and if you look at the current issue of newsweek there is an op-ed piece on the topic of the health care debate that is by our founding chairman, robert rosenkranz, pick it up and read it, it’s worth it, and at this point i’d like to introduce robert rosenkranz, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
well thank you very much and welcome to this evening’s debate. %$* 1
well, i assume we’re mostly new yorkers here, and we all know that new york has its problems. %$* 1
but california’s are worse, or at least so new yorkers like to believe. %$* 1
california has hollywood, silicon valley, and way better weather. %$* 1
but california’s credit rating is lower than ours, new york state legislators can look at the california legislature, and come away with delusions of adequacy. %$* 1
the political divide between san francisco liberals and orange county conservatives, is actually more acute than ours. %$* 1
and in california it takes two-thirds of the legislature to impose taxes. %$* 1
which virtually assures recurring budget crises. %$* 1
california’s experiment with direct democracy, the referendum system, has demonstrated that voters like to receive benefits from the state, but don’t like to pay for them. %$* 1
a result, i suspect, you are shocked, shocked to learn. %$* 1
with a looming $20 billion budget gap, and 1 percent of the taxpayers already footing 50 percent of the bills, will california be able to squeak by? %$* 1
or will it become the lehman brothers of state government? %$* 1
will a vibrant private sector bail out its mismanaged state sector. %$* 1
or is california our first failed state. %$* 1
and let me emphasize the “first” in this proposition. %$* 1
are its problems the result of a uniquely dysfunctional political culture, or are they the harbinger of things to come, to a big- spending, highly-taxed state, close to home. %$* 1
with that, we have a terrific panel who i think will shed some light on these questions and it’s my pleasure now to turn the evening back to john donvan and our panelists tonight. %$* 1
round of applause for robert rosenkranz, please, thank you. %$* 13
well, hello everyone, and welcome to another debate from intelligence squared us, i’m john donvan of abc news, and once again, it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator, as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
six debaters, three against three, will be debating this motion— “california is the first failed state.” now, i want to point out that this is a debate, it’s not a symposium or a seminar, it is a contest. %$* 13
these two teams are here to win. %$* 13
and you our audience serve as our judges, by the time the debate has concluded you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after. %$* 13
vote on whether you agree with the proposition, “california is the first failed state,” or whether you vote against it. %$* 13
at the end of the debate the team that has changed the most minds, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let’s go to the preliminary vote, if you look to the right arm of your seat, there’s a keypad %$* 13
numbered 1 through 0, only pay attention to keys number 1, 2, and 3, if you agree with the motion, “california is the first failed state,” press number 1.if you disagree press number 2.if you are undecided, press number 3, and if you make a mistake just correct yourself and the system will lock in the last key that you pressed. %$* 13
and i’m gathering from expressions that everyone has completed this. %$* 13
no one needs more time? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
and so to round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
seven minutes each. %$* 13
our first debater speaking for the motion, “california is the first failed state,” andreas kluth, who is the economist’s west coast correspondent. %$* 13
he covers politics, society, and the economy in california and the western states, he spent a long time working out of new york. %$* 13
having made the move to california, andreas, i understand in your office you work from a yoga mat. %$* 13
is this is not the influence of california, on— %$* 13
on a tatami mat, in the lotus position, that’s true. %$* 182
ladies and gentlemen, andreas kluth— %$* 13
i’m willing to prove it. %$* 182
thank you. %$* 182
california is the first failed state, and most of you probably believe that already. %$* 182
which is a tactical disadvantage for us on this side, but if you do, we want to keep your vote. %$* 182
for the rest of you, we’d like to convince you of that this evening. %$* 182
and, before i start doing that, i just want to clear away something that might be confusing. %$* 182
the proposition is cheeky, as all of you know, all good oxford-style debates start with a cheeky proposition. %$* 182
the reason this one is cheeky, is that “failed states” usually refer to sovereign states. %$* 182
somalia, sudan, yemen, haiti. %$* 182
and what those have in common, is that they have lost a monopoly on legitimate violence, if you think that through, or maybe back to poli. %$* 182
sci. %$* 182
when that happens, warlords take over or maybe somalian pirates, and the state as such loses authority, well clearly, no one on the stage tonight is going to argue in the next two hours that california is already ruled by warlords or pirates. %$* 182
so what are we talking about when we talk about one of the 50 states, domestic states. %$* 182
we have to agree to a working definition to make this interesting. %$* 182
california and other domestic states that may follow have failed, if they fail to support their citizens and instead hinder them. %$* 182
what’s another way of saying that is, if a state, if the governance part of the state as opposed to private industry, can no longer address or solve the problems it faces, then it has failed. %$* 182
california easily meets those criteria. %$* 182
and i just want to quickly because that timer is running already, run down some of the problems to remind you, maybe we can go into them later in depth. %$* 182
prisons, california has the worst recidivism rate in the country, how did it get like that. %$* 182
water, it’s an infrastructure and a climate issue but it’s also a political, a governance issue. %$* 182
education. %$* 182
before california became a failed state in the pat brown era of the ‘50s and ‘60s it built the best public university system in the country, it is currently dismantling that because it is now a failed state. %$* 182
budgets. %$* 182
and a state is supposed to have a budget, to pass it on time, california never does, that started well before the recession. %$* 182
california—or states are supposed to pay their bills to their vendors and so forth, as all of you know, probably all of you know, california has been paying with i.o.u.’s. %$* 182
courts. %$* 182
i asked ronald george, chief justice of the supreme court, whether he thought it was a failed state, he could say you could argue that, if the state no longer administers justice because its courts are closed part of the time, and dockets of cases is backlogged. %$* 182
california has the worst credit rating of the 50, you know that, it was just lowered again by s&p.our opponents may try to convince you tonight that this has something to do with the great recession, and that as soon as there’s a recovery these problems will recede. %$* 182
it’s not true, all of you have heard warren buffett say it’s only when the tide goes out when you learn who’s swimming naked. %$* 182
california has been undressing since the 1970s, i hope to get into that. %$* 182
i argue that it’s been stark naked since the ‘90s, and indeed, the tide has just now gone out with the great recession but that’s not something that happened overnight, the failure that is, the nakedness. %$* 182
it’s just been revealed. %$* 182
our opponents may also argue that california has problems, but all states have problems, as mr. %$* 182
rosenkranz reminded you here. %$* 182
and that that does not amount to failure, that’s not true, that’s not appropriate in the case of california, because only one state has all problems simultaneously. %$* 182
and when you have all problems simultaneously you tie them together into a straitjacket and that’s what california is in, it’s in a straitjacket, because of its governance structures. %$* 182
i want to develop that in the time that remains right now a little bit, and then hopefully go deeper into it later in the evening to show to you what the unique aspect of that confluence is. %$* 182
unique number 1.three states, for example, have the super-majority requirement that both houses of a legislature have two-thirds votes to pass a budget, three states. %$* 182
arkansas, rhode island, and california, nothing unusual yet. %$* 182
16 states have the same super-majority required to raise taxes. %$* 182
only one state has both. %$* 182
how did california— california is that state. %$* 182
how did california get that second super-majority requirement. %$* 182
it was the infamous prop 13, i understand it’s famous even on this coast %$* 182
1978 when they started undressing. %$* 182
it is part of something called direct democracy that the founders of the nation, as opposed to the state, were very skeptical and afraid of—about, afraid of. %$* 182
it includes initiatives, referenda and recalls. %$* 182
24 states have initiatives, have direct democracy. %$* 182
only one does not allow its legislature, to amend initiatives that its own voters have passed, no matter how insane. %$* 182
only one state, only one state has the process, has really run certifiably amok, out of control, insane, in only one state, do the inmates run the asylum. %$* 182
tonight, you may hear that california, this usually comes up, has great weather. %$* 182
you may hear about its beautiful redwoods, yosemite’s gorgeous. %$* 182
you may hear about the vibrancy of silicon valley which i used to cover. %$* 182
all that is true, it’s all irrelevant. %$* 182
because we’re not talking about whether or not the state has assets. %$* 182
whether or not there are some good things in the state. %$* 182
of course there are. %$* 182
we’re talking about whether the state as such, the structures that make the state, the governance structures, have failed, and indeed they have, and the other states must be very careful unless they have the same unique—the same combination of problems that put them in the same straitjacket, and also lead to failure. %$* 182
our opponents are great orators %$* 182
don’t let them confuse you tonight %$* 182
i’ll be back in a little, in a few minutes, but for now just remember what the definition of a domestic failed state is, remember to stay on our side, stay on our side, you probably are there already. %$* 182
california is the first failed state. %$* 182
thank you, andreas kluth. %$* 13
our motion is “california is the first failed state,” you’ve heard the first opening statement in support of the motion, now to speak first against the motion, i’d like to introduce gray davis, the 37th governor of california who happens to be like me, bronx-born. %$* 13
anybody else? %$* 13
oh, a lotta hands, lotta hands. %$* 13
governor, you can start heading for your lectern. %$* 13
governor davis encountered direct democracy head-on-head when he lost a recall election in 2003, but prior to that he had won almost every election he had ever run in as he served as state controller and as lieutenant governor. %$* 13
he is, though bronx-born, a true californian, ladies and gentlemen, gray davis. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 183
thank you, john, i’m thrilled to be back in new york, as john said i was born here, many of my relatives are here, actually most of my relatives. %$* 183
i graduated from columbia law school. %$* 183
and not to be undone, nyu sent me two graduate students to help me get reelected in 2002, so. %$* 183
i’m fond of new york, i think i have a sense of how new yorkers think and i think a lot of you probably voted that california is the first failed state, so my hope is that i can impress you with what is right about california, and why it’s already an asset to the nation, and will be more of an asset as we move forward in this global society. %$* 183
first let me acknowledge that there are problems in sacramento %$* 183
but the shortcomings of our elected officials should not detract from the creative contributions of our 37 million citizens. %$* 183
our gdp which is one way we measure societies in this world, is $1.9 trillion, far and away the largest in america. %$* 183
larger than russia, larger than india, larger than canada. %$* 183
in fact the eighth largest in the world. %$* 183
and if we were a separate country, we would be a member of the g8.so one way we measure societies in a capitalistic world, is by their gdp and certainly california has no apologies for that. %$* 183
i’m also pleased to see that a recent edition of time magazine agreed, and was very bullish on california. %$* 183
it titled its piece, “california is still the american dream,” and i quote: “it is”— “it” meaning california— “is the cutting edge of america’s future. %$* 183
it is the greenest, most diverse %$* 183
most global %$* 183
and most asian-oriented society at a time when the world is moving in all those directions. %$* 183
it is an unparalleled engine of innovation, a mecca of high-tech, biotech, and now clean-tech. %$* 183
in fact, from 2006”— and i’m still quoting—“2006 to 2008, it received 60 percent of all the clean-tech investments in this country, and in 2008 it received more venture capital funds than the other 49 states combined.” with all of its problems it still managed to nurture some of the most innovative companies in the world, google, apple, hewlett-packard, myspace, facebook, twitter, youtube, cisco, intel, disney, ebay, and many other companies that are helping invent the future for california and for the— for america. %$* 183
california is all about change. %$* 183
it likes to get there first, and it frequently does, it was the first state to regulate greenhouse gases. %$* 183
it was the first to allow full-scale stem-cell research. %$* 183
it was the first to establish renewable energy portfolio standards. %$* 183
what do i mean by that. %$* 183
it said to its utilities, use renewable energy. %$* 183
depend less on fossil fuel. %$* 183
as governor i was proud to sign all those bills into law, but prouder still, to be part of a 35-year tradition of promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation. %$* 183
now why am i talking about this. %$* 183
because, the green economy is the next great wave in the american economy. %$* 183
we have to be green, we have to be reorienting the grid, we have to live more lightly on the planet if we are going to compete globally. %$* 183
35 years ago, during the first energy crisis, california decided, if it wanted to promote conservation, it has to give the utilities a financial incentive to permit that. %$* 183
so it said to the utilities, you can make more money if you encourage your customers to consume less. %$* 183
and ever since then, we’ve been regulating everything that uses electricity, from appliances, refrigerators, dishwashers, homes, all kinds of businesses, cars, and even lately flat-screen tvs, and along the way, we saved rate-payers $56 billion, and avoided building 24 new power plants. %$* 183
in fact, our electricity growth has been nada, zippo, zero, over 30 years, as we became the largest state in america-- %$* 183
the rest of the country is more than 50 percent. %$* 183
why do i tell you that? %$* 183
because how america obtains energy in the future, will be critical to our economy, our environment, and to national security. %$* 183
and i submit to you that california’s proven leadership in this area over the last 35 years, will stand this nation in very good stead. %$* 183
now to be sure, we have problems in sacramento, but believe me, the voters have tuned in to this issue, and they have already made change that’s substantial. %$* 183
for many years the legislators drew their own districts, meaning they decided in what district they would run, they decided you would be in my district, you would not. %$* 183
and so not surprisingly, they almost never lose. %$* 183
governor schwarzenegger proposed a redistricting plan, it passed, i supported it because i believe it’s time the voters draw the line, not the people and it’s time we bring accountability to sacramento, that will kick in in 2012 and that will make a big difference. %$* 183
now voters get punished if they react harshly towards their core constituencies, republican- raised taxes, they have all kinds of recall attempts against them, democrats punish the teachers, there’s a primary opponent next time. %$* 183
under a redistricting plan, if you don’t solve the problem, you will get defeated. %$* 183
similarly in june there is an open primary %$* 183
a change i predict california will embrace, i support it, i’m the only governor elected in an open primary, the supreme court of the united states struck it down, but they have approved this version. %$* 183
it’s essentially a municipal election. %$* 183
if anyone can vote, independents, republicans and democrats, and you can vote for a republican for governor or a green party for governor or a democrat for governor. %$* 183
the top two vote-getters run off in the general election, even if they’re from the same party. %$* 183
that’s going to produce pragmatic, moderate problem-solving candidates. %$* 183
finally there’s a call for a constitutional convention. %$* 183
i support that idea. %$* 183
it’s time we eliminated in my judgment the two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget. %$* 183
yes, we have a two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget, and a separate one to pass the budget. %$* 183
just that requirement to get a two-thirds vote to pass a budget is the reason we are always late, it’s ridiculous, only three other states have it. %$* 183
i think that’s the kinda thing a constitutional convention will change, and if the changes are, are sensible, the voters will accept it. %$* 183
so in short, our private sector is the envy of the world, and innovation will lead america, into a future that is brighter and stronger. %$* 183
our public sector is on the mend and will get better at the end of 2010. vote no, number 2, vote no. %$* 183
thank you, gray davis. %$* 13
our motion is “california is the first failed state,” and up now to argue for this motion, to argue that california is the first failed state i’d like to introduce sharon waxman, who has a long and distinguished career working for the new york times and the washington post both as a foreign correspondent and as a reporter covering the entertainment industry from the inside out, she’s written books about it. %$* 13
she has started a web portal on the entertainment industry known as the wrap.com, and though you are arguing that california’s a failed state you believe enough to base your business there. %$* 13
am i right about that? %$* 13
yeah, i like the weather. %$* 184
okay. %$* 13
it makes sense, ladies and gentlemen, sharon waxman. %$* 13
so before i get going i just want to know if gray davis’s relatives are going to get to vote this evening? %$* 184
if they’re filling half the room. %$* 184
i come to you tonight as a mother, as an engaged citizen, and as a journalist who has covered california for the past 15 years. %$* 184
so let’s start with the area i know best that i deal with every day and that’s hollywood. %$* 184
hollywood, the symbol, a signature of california. %$* 184
part of the dream of what california represents. %$* 184
and a symbol of course to the world of california’s industry, creativity, prosperity, and the values of american culture. %$* 184
here’s the only problem with that. %$* 184
hollywood’s not really in hollywood anymore. %$* 184
it’s gone to new mexico, and arizona, and new york, and vancouver, and london. %$* 184
so avatar, the movie that is now breaking all the box-office records was really filmed in new zealand. %$* 184
and twilight, that series that all your kids, all your daughters are going to see was filmed in vancouver, and harry potter, that series of extremely successful movies was filmed in london. %$* 184
so the people who run the industry, which is a fairly small number of people, they still live in brentwood and bel air and beverly hills and places like that but the hundreds and thousands of jobs that produce this, juggernaut of—not just of jobs but of tax revenues to the state, has largely fled, film production is down to half of what it was in california in 1996.this is the way things are going, and the reason for me it has a lot to do with california failing to create a sense of connectedness with this incredibly core industry, it’s so much of what we ought to be proud of, by the way of course the entertainment industry is one of america’s top exports, not only california. %$* 184
but it doesn’t feel like that there is a connection between what the state represents, and the identification that we have with hollywood and that vast entertainment industry, with the state, and why is that. %$* 184
it seems to me that the state has neglected it as it has neglected so many things. %$* 184
and that goes to me to sort—one of the, one of my big observations about living in california especially after having lived around the world for much of the beginning of my adult life, is that there isn’t that sense of connectedness, as a community. %$* 184
and the state plays a big role in that. %$* 184
where we live in california, is largely in gated communities, with private security, we live in isolation, and this is nothing new, we all know that. %$* 184
people, you can go to a place like koreatown which has the largest ethnic community of koreans outside of korea, 800,000 people. %$* 184
that community feels extremely korean. %$* 184
they feel extremely connected to the country of their parents’ birth or of their birth or of their ancestors. %$* 184
i don’t think they feel californian. %$* 184
and i think that that’s true of so many of the ethnic groups that have come to live in enclaves in california. %$* 184
i see that as a failure of the state to create that sense of identity among them. %$* 184
here’s another big thing that bothers me. %$* 184
people who know me know that this is my pet peeve. %$* 184
the state has not provided an infrastructure that allows us to be a community, and community is all about what the state is there to protect, and preserve, and to nourish. %$* 184
so i can’t tell you how many times i have driven up to the edge of the 10 freeway from where i live in santa monica, peered over the railing, hoping to go to a lakers game, or to visit a museum, or to go visit disney hall for the first time which i would have never succeeded in doing when they were actually playing a concert, and, dared to jump into that essential parking lot of the 10 freeway. %$* 184
that’s because, there isn’t a transportation system that works. %$* 184
we are essentially a city that sits on the roads, and that we have of course made a decision not to have a public transportation of any significance, and the roads are long- neglected and the state has not invested in them, to me, that is, as a member of-- %$* 184
somebody who wants to participate in the community, i feel i can’t get to the community, and that to me is a failure of the state. %$* 184
finally, i want to speak to you as a mother. %$* 184
i’m the mother of three children. %$* 184
and i moved my family from europe actually, to raise them in california, and we all, all of us in our family, my husband and i and kids who were then small, were aware of what it meant to go pursue the california dream. %$* 184
that dream has really turned out to be one that we have to create for ourselves. %$* 184
we came from europe where public transport was something that was a given. %$* 184
medical care was a given, education was a given. %$* 184
at the very least, i knew that coming to california, that i was moving to a state that had the best public university system in the country, if not the world. %$* 184
today, that system has been, i feel, taken away from us. %$* 184
because of the problems with the state, they just, again, you probably all read about it, raised the fees some 30 percent in the uc system, and, they’re now approaching the fees of a private university, it now costs about the same to go to ucla law school—my son the lawyer, i’m just still as it is to go to a private law school. %$* 184
how is it that the state is abdicating its role in creating a generation of the best and the brightest in the state of california, which was all about what california represented. %$* 184
all of this together, leads me to say to you, that california is a failed state. %$* 184
i commend the governor on all of the changes that he’s laying out as hoping to come to california, and, as an entrepreneur having started the wrap.com, i can tell you that there are wonderful companies there—and i chose to start my company in california, however, that doesn’t mean that that is because the state encourages us to do so or allows us to do so, that is a testament to the innovation that the citizens and the residents of california have shown. %$* 184
it is not proof that the state has not failed. %$* 184
and so i would like you to vote for the proposition that california is the first failed state. %$* 184
it has neglected its fundamental industries, it has neglected its fundamental functions, and it has neglected its fundamental values as a state. %$* 184
thank you, sharon waxman. %$* 13
thank you, sharon waxman. %$* 13
okay, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan of abc news, we are listening to opening statements from each side. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams of three and they are fighting it out over this motion, “california is the first failed state.” now on to our next speaker against the motion %$* 13
i’d like to introduce van jones, van jones was the founder, co-founder of the ella baker foundation for human rights and green for all. %$* 13
he was part of the obama administration as special advisor for green jobs, he resigned that position after being targeted in a nasty political imbroglio, but his standing in the greenest state in the nation is enormously high in the green movement, and van, i saw on facebook only today, a “draft van jones for governor” page? %$* 13
would %$* 13
would you want the job? %$* 13
well, i—it would be and i’ll tell you this. %$* 185
one of the—i’m not running, but— be an honor to serve butt-- %$* 185
and i’ll tell you why, first of all, california is not a failed state and our colleagues have pretty much conceded that they cannot win this argument based on the assertion that it’s a failed state so instead they point to some failings. %$* 185
but what they haven’t told you is that every single one of the problems—structural and otherwise— that have been pointed to you, have solutions, and the solutions are now on the way. %$* 185
we have in our state %$* 185
we are the biggest state—we have some of the biggest problems—we also have the biggest potential for problem solving, and the largest number of problem solvers. %$* 185
so every one of the structural problems that has been pointed out—from redistricting to the tax issues, to the budget issues—have gathered the combined wisdom across the political spectrum, there are now ballot measures moving forward, there are solutions for these problems. %$* 185
to say that california is a failed state is different than saying it has some failings. %$* 185
we have some serious failings, but we also have a set of assets, that our friend was trying to make sure you didn’t pay attention to, that will help us solve these problems. %$* 185
first of all, when you look at a state like california, you look at a state that, on the three critical issues that are most important for our country, california is not failing—it is succeeding and it is leading. %$* 185
what are the three critical issues? %$* 185
number one, how will we power america, as the governor just talked about. %$* 185
how will we power this country? %$* 185
will we continue to rely on the post well oil strategy that we have been stuck in, with petroleum and coal for 100, 150 years now—it’s the post whale oil strategy—we’ll continue with that? %$* 185
or will, will we innovate our way out? %$* 185
will we invent and invest our way out? %$* 185
in california, that is what we are doing. %$* 185
in a failed state, capital does not flow in—capital flows out. %$* 185
in california, we have quadrupled—in the past two years— the amount of venture capital flowing into the state, because we are trying to solve the biggest problem humanity faces: the problem of global warming, and the biggest problem our country faces: the problem of energy independence. %$* 185
california is leading and succeeding in that. %$* 185
we just attracted a company, electric vehicles international, to come and build zero emission cars in california. %$* 185
they could have gone anywhere in the world. %$* 185
they came to california because of the policy certainty, because of the consumer demand, because we are on the front edge. %$* 185
we have policies in place passed—despite all the problems with our legislature—we have passed on a bipartisan basis with a republican governor %$* 185
a democratic legislature, ab 32, our global warming solution act, which will drive the creation of 400,000 clean and green jobs. %$* 185
we have set high aspirations with regard to renewable energy. %$* 185
possibly, as many as three-quarters of a million jobs that will be created there. %$* 185
15,000 jobs right now in solar, in the solar industry, and growing. %$* 185
a failed state doesn’t do that. %$* 185
that is not a failed state. %$* 185
number two yes, sacramento has a ton of problems. %$* 185
help is on the way. %$* 185
great ideas are on the way. %$* 185
but the entire state of california did not live in sacramento. %$* 185
we have an incredible level of innovation at the governance level, cities, and regionally across the state, because the second big problem is—how are going to live together in cities? %$* 185
how are we going to live together at a community level? %$* 185
can we solve problems? %$* 185
you see in california, problems are being solved every day—tough problems. %$* 185
look at the problems with the port of los angeles—just to brag a little bit on the people of california—where the pollution was so bad that little kids who live close to the port of los angeles were getting asthma and dying, and people said that we can’t solve this problem because of the logjams and all the special interests. %$* 185
they got together, they sat down, they came up with a clean truck program that helped lift the living standards of 10,000 truckers. %$* 185
got new technology in those trucks on the roads, and took asthma inhalers out of little girls’ and little boys’ pockets. %$* 185
that is the kind of problem solving that’s going on at the local level. %$* 185
in fresno, you have a wonderful new mayor, ashley swearengin, who has been able to pull people together in the agricultural heartland of our state, and create 19,000 new jobs, through a regional economic initiative. %$* 185
in northern california, you have mayors like gavin newsom, ron dellums and others who had come together, who have come up with local creative financing to get green home improvements going, weatherization and solar panels attached to property taxes so people can actually get all these new technologies going. %$* 185
and these are the kinds of things that are happening on a daily basis. %$* 185
and those things don’t happen in a failed state. %$* 185
in a failed state, when things are tough, people turn on each other. %$* 185
in california, people are turning to each other, and working together across lines of class and color. %$* 185
and the last thing i want to say is that the, the third big challenge for this country and for this world is—how are we going to live together? %$* 185
in the age of this kind of diversity, how are we going to live together? %$* 185
there is a miracle every single day in california, a miracle. %$* 185
and it’s a miracle of cooperation. %$* 185
in oakland, california, there are 30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools—30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools. %$* 185
to the extent that there is conflict—it’s not about that %$* 185
it’s not about that. %$* 185
we have been able to figure out a way to come together, to work together. %$* 185
that is not just a good example for the united states %$* 185
that’s a good example for the world. %$* 185
there is no place in the world that has the kind of diversity and density that we have %$* 185
that manages to do it with elegance, that manages to do it successfully. %$* 185
and when you have a state where 20 years ago there was a conflagration over race and ethnicity—people remember los angeles 20, almost 20 years ago. %$* 185
somebody stood up and said, “can’t we all get along? %$* 185
can’t we all get along? %$* 185
” californians have answered that question—yes we can, yes we can get along— and we do it every day. %$* 185
and it’s out of that community of many colors, many classes, with every faith, every sexuality, working together on a daily basis, that great solutions have come in our economy, have come in local governments, and are now coming from our state governance. %$* 185
this is not a failed state. %$* 185
we have some failings, but this state is a state that is now rallying to solve those problems. %$* 185
don’t vote against us, vote for us. %$* 185
thank you very much. %$* 185
thank you, van jones. %$* 13
our motion is, “california is the first failed state.” and now to argue for that motion, to argue that california is the first failed state, i would like to introduce bobby shriver, who is a councilman in santa monica and co-founder of one.org, and a scion of one of america’s greatest political families, ladies and gentlemen, bobby shriver. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 186
i also want to put in a plug for red, which i started also with my great colleague, bono, my partner—which i always like saying. %$* 186
because most of my life, people have been saying other things about me. %$* 186
i was president kennedy’s nephew. %$* 186
when my dad started the peace corps, i was sergeant shriver’s son. %$* 186
when my mom started the special olympics, i was eunice shriver’s son. %$* 186
and then a terrible thing happened in our family—my sister went on national television and became the host of the cbs morning news. %$* 186
so four brothers, very competitive irish family, were faced with the prospect that we were going to be known forever as maria shriver’s brothers. %$* 186
so we had a meeting—what could we do about it? %$* 186
and we had various ideas, none of them very good. %$* 186
and at one point, one of my brothers said, “well, face it, you know, it’s done, and it can’t get any worse.” and then maria got married. %$* 186
so, i love it when i go and see in the program that i am bono’s partner, because i am really tired of being arnold schwarzenegger’s brother-in-law. %$* 186
i appreciated our eloquence of some of our colleagues, but i want to point out very, very specifically that all of the answers are on the way. %$* 186
they are not here now. %$* 186
and i can tell you in local government, where i serve on the city council in santa monica, that things are bad. %$* 186
we are lucky in santa monica because we have a great, diverse tax base. %$* 186
but just to give you a couple of illustrations %$* 186
our redevelopment agency had a budget this year of 30 million dollars—the state took 22 million of that. %$* 186
how can you work on that basis? %$* 186
and this is a reminder also, that when you talk about the state, you are not talking about google and intel %$* 186
and you are not talking about local government %$* 186
you are talking about the state government. %$* 186
it’s very important. %$* 186
the state is a constitutional entity, it’s a legal entity. %$* 186
it’s not california. %$* 186
when steve jobs writes on every apple product, “designed in california, assembled in china,” he is not talking about designed in the state house of california %$* 186
he is talking about in the culture of california, which i think we all agree is the greatest culture in america and maybe in the world. %$* 186
thank you. %$* 186
there are local californias in the culture. %$* 186
think about it. %$* 186
right now %$* 186
a good interesting point, segue, i’ll go to your idea. %$* 186
there is no art education in the state in the public schools. %$* 186
we are the last in the state, in all of the 50 states. %$* 186
we are below guam in arts education. %$* 186
i am serious. %$* 186
i mean, it’s %$* 186
it’s kind of a little funny, but it’s hard to believe really %$* 186
and that’s a state responsibility. %$* 186
the money is not there. %$* 186
why is the money not there? %$* 186
because the people have lost confidence in the government obviously. %$* 186
i’ll give you another example. %$* 186
in los angeles, we have the biggest homeless population in america, 80,000-plus people. %$* 186
the l.a. county jail is the largest mental health facility in the world %$* 186
in the world. %$* 186
if you go there, every single one of you—i don’t care what your background or point of view on this debate would be— would be sickened to see what’s going on in there. %$* 186
there is a famous quote from the, uh, i think it’s hammerati who said, “the purpose %$* 186
one of the purposes of government is to protect the weak from the strong.” we have completely failed. %$* 186
you go in that l.a. county jail and you will see the weakest people in our society %$* 186
mentally ill people living in cages %$* 186
there are 14 full-time pharmacists to medicate them %$* 186
in downtown l.a. %$* 186
of the 85 or some-odd thousand people that are homeless, about a third are veterans. %$* 186
we have a 400-acre property in west l.a. in westwood %$* 186
that have empty buildings in it %$* 186
which were built as mental institutions for veterans that are empty—and have been empty for more than 20 years. %$* 186
why is that? %$* 186
the state hasn’t cooperated with the feds to fix that %$* 186
i don’t know %$* 186
i can’t come here and give you an answer. %$* 186
i have been trying to fix it for the last five years, and so far i have failed. %$* 186
although president bush and secretary nicholson did designate three of the buildings for homeless veterans—which is a positive thing. %$* 186
and i understand that one of the answers on the way—there is 50 million dollars in the new defense appropriations bill for that building, which would be a great thing. %$* 186
but the fact that people burnt %$* 186
and in my little ol’ santa monica, a man burnt to death in a dumpster %$* 186
a homeless man, burnt to death in a dumpster several months ago %$* 186
is unacceptable. %$* 186
and you would say, well, that, you %$* 186
as a senior official of the state said to me, “well, bob, you know, you gotta calm down. %$* 186
you know, you gotta %$* 186
you are very hopped up about this homeless thing.” and he said, “why are you so hopped up about it? %$* 186
” i said, “i am afraid my mom—god bless her and god rest her soul—is going to hear that a homeless guy burnt to death in a dumpster in my jurisdiction” %$* 186
which is what she used to call it, “my jurisdiction,” not “my constituency.” because she would be enraged. %$* 186
so, going on to the kinds of things that sharon said. %$* 186
the public community—which is really the primary goal of the state—not to get too esoteric about it—but to have a kind of political compassion for people does not exist. %$* 186
you can’t have that many homeless people %$* 186
you can’t have the underfunding of education that exists %$* 186
you can’t have that many homeless veterans %$* 186
and say that the state has been successful in creating—amongst its citizens—a concept of political compassion. %$* 186
that we are going to get together %$* 186
we have community interests. %$* 186
we are going to get together and we are going to do something about them. %$* 186
and ideas are on the way %$* 186
and green tech, great. %$* 186
it’s all fantastic. %$* 186
for the least of these, it’s not fantastic in california. %$* 186
it’s really not. %$* 186
i’ll give you another example—a local example. %$* 186
the city of beverly hills has a school system, santa monica has one. %$* 186
the state is organizing school districts like that. %$* 186
they had kids from out of the city of beverly hills in that district, because the state used to pay—and still may—a certain amount per student. %$* 186
so you would bring people from out of your district who were not there and educate them. %$* 186
they changed that formula recently, and what did beverly hills do? %$* 186
—and they are not bad people— they expelled all those kids. %$* 186
why? %$* 186
we are not getting paid for it anymore. %$* 186
that’s a state failure—not a beverly hills failure, not a failure of those communities. %$* 186
so as you think about how you are going to vote, it’s very important to say %$* 186
and i like to be optimistic—and i am optimistic. %$* 186
when they asked me, which side of this debate did i want to be on, i said i wanted to be on this one. %$* 186
and they said, well, don’t you want to be on the optimistic side? %$* 186
i said, this is the optimistic side. %$* 186
this is the optimistic side. %$* 186
because if you don’t know that the problem is as bad as it is %$* 186
if you don’t go to the l.a. county jail and see that %$* 186
you think— and i mean this respectfully—that help is on the way. %$* 186
help is not on the way. %$* 186
we, this year %$* 186
i’ll give you one final example. %$* 186
the calpers—the pension charged to little, to cities—going up 25 percent. %$* 186
in our budget, that’s a breaker, you know? %$* 186
so it has nothing to do, as i said—i am repeating myself—with google %$* 186
it has to do with, can you run the trains on time? %$* 186
thank you. %$* 186
wow. %$* 130
i am serious. %$* 186
i mean, it’s %$* 186
it’s kind of a little funny, but it’s hard to believe really %$* 186
and that’s a state responsibility. %$* 186
the money is not there. %$* 186

“california is the first failed state” is our motion. %$* 13

and next up to argue against this motion, lawrence o’donnell, who has one of these renaissance men résumés, having held positions as a political analyst for msnbc and having served as chief of staff for the u.s.senate finance committee, and for being a writer and producer on west wing and for being an actor on big love as well. %$* 13

they are attractive to many muslims, not thousands but in the millions, and what they say-- %$* 331
and that’s why they’re influential-- %$* 331
is they challenge every single muslim individual, are you a true muslim? %$* 331
if you are a true muslim, you live by what the koran dictates, you follow the example of the prophet mohammad. %$* 331
right. %$* 330
their interpretation, though. %$* 330
those scholars insist on that, are far more influential, far more powerful than your soft- spoken, wonderful, cuddly scholars. %$* 331
ayaan, you just quoted bin laden as a scholar. %$* 332
hassan al-banna as a scholar. %$* 332
bin laden, for those of you who don’t know, is an engineer, a qualified engineer. %$* 332
so you don't know him. %$* 332
why don't you define whose-- %$* 331
don’t know his history. %$* 332
he's a qualified engineer who comes from one of the richest construction families in saudi arabia and was educated in the elite private schools of switzerland and saudi arabia. %$* 332
hassan al-banna that you referred to was a school teacher. %$* 332
and in fact what you find common with all of the movements that you are worried about, and that i am worried about, and we're all worried about, are that they are founded by people who do not have a theological background. %$* 332
now, for all we think about al-azhar, and they have very conservative views, what we don't find is that al- azhar produces the likes of bin laden and hassan al-banna, or even maududi, the founder of jamaat-e-islami islam in the indian subcontinent. %$* 332
maududi was a journalist. %$* 332
sayyid qutb, the founder of modern day jihadism, was a literary critic who came to america on a scholarship in the 1950s to study literature. %$* 332
he was not a theologian. %$* 332
so coming back to the point-- %$* 332
why don't you name a number of scholars who are influential who are not-- %$* 331
please, ayaan, don't define for the whole world who a muslim scholar is, because actually the people you referred to were not qualified theologians. %$* 332
but don't you touch on the problem by admitting this? %$* 331
don't you touch on the problem that is inherent in islam after the death of mohammad, that the problem of who speaks for islam has not been resolved. %$* 331
it could be the two of you. %$* 331
it could be bin laden. %$* 331
it could be al qaradawi. %$* 331
it could be faisal shahzad. %$* 331
hang on. %$* 13
the question is, what does that have to do with islam being a religion of peace? %$* 13
you're almost making the argument that islam is what you want it to be, depending on how you behave. %$* 13
so if you behave peacefully, is it not a religion of peace to you. %$* 13
that is a brilliant question. %$* 331
you can start by saying islam is something to-- %$* 331
a different thing to 1.57 billion people. %$* 331
and from that general point, you can reduce it to what is it that unifies them? %$* 331
and ultimately, you will get to the koran and the hadith. %$* 331
the koran, the hadith, the day of judgment. %$* 331
the belief in the day of judgment, and if you take those three concepts, then it's far from a religion of peace because you look, first of all, not only at the content of the koran-- %$* 331
in context, fine. %$* 331
i am willing to contextualize it. %$* 331
but what if other believes are not, and they're influential? %$* 331
what if i want to read mohammad's practices simply as a matter of history, another great figure in history? %$* 331
but more muslims, millions of muslims don't want to do that and really want to follow his practices. %$* 331
what if more and more muslims invest in the hereafter more than they invest in life? %$* 331
then we have a problem. %$* 331
and that's why i ask you to vote against the motion, it cannot be only a religion of peace, because if it were only a religion of peace, if it were perfect, why would we have this debate, why would we-- %$* 331
douglas, given the long run that ayaan had, can you be 15 seconds? %$* 13
imagine trying to imply that the whole extremist problem is a misreading by engineers and literary critics. %$* 333
unfortunately, that's simply not the case, hasn't been historically in islam, and isn't now. %$* 333
ayatollah khomeini, who ayaan mentioned earlier, was not a self- trained engineer, rich boy, like-- %$* 333
you know, unfortunately, and managed to hurtle a very developed, distinguished culture back in time in 1979, and hurtled this country back into the state it's currently in, under these cloaked dictators. %$* 333
the grand mufti of egypt is not a self taught-- %$* 333
all right. %$* 13
we seem to be going-- %$* 13
and i don't need a list. %$* 13
that all muslims should go and fight the israelis %$* 333
maajid. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 332
on khomeini. %$* 332
i acknowledge khomeini is a trained theologian. %$* 332
and the fact is he came in the '70s, douglas. %$* 332
and that proves something. %$* 332
what was he so famous for? %$* 332
khomeini was recognized for bringing a revolution in shiite theology. %$* 332
and what was the revolution? %$* 332
those of you who have studied this will know that the revolution was, up until him, shiites had been avowedly religiously secular, because they believed no one had the right to rule in god's name until the messiah came, and let them wait for that messiah until the end of time. %$* 332
khomeini changed that and turned it on its head. %$* 332
and if that proves something, it proves one thing, and that is it was not in-- %$* 332
it was not consistent with islamic shiite tradition. %$* 332
what he did was a very modern revolution, influenced by his studies in europe and influenced by modern european fascism. %$* 332
he broke from tradition, and that's why it was called a revolution. %$* 332
he was not a continuant of shiite traditionalism. %$* 332
it's the fault of the europeans, in other words. %$* 331
no, no. %$* 332
no one's saying it's-- %$* 332
remember, the-- %$* 331
come on-- %$* 332
i want to ask you something about reforms for islam. %$* 13
does islam need reform? %$* 13
it needs a renaissance. %$* 330
it doesn't need a reform. %$* 330
reform in the sense-- %$* 330
and the reason i say that is because we have to be careful of our terminology. %$* 330
if we say reform as in reformation, we're thinking of a christian context where you had the protestants and martin luther rejecting the catholicism and the pope. %$* 330
but the thing is in islam, there is no pope. %$* 330
there is no centralized authority. %$* 330
so there can't be a reformation in that sense. %$* 330
what there needs to be is a return to genuine islamic principles which have been not studies, have not been enforced and were forgotten. %$* 330
so it's not exactly that. %$* 330
a return to genuine islamic principles is exactly what al-qaeda is advocating. %$* 331
no, that's not actually what they're-- %$* 330
no, that's actually incorrect. %$* 330
a return, a rebirth-- %$* 331
i'm sorry, the radio cannot make sense of two voices. %$* 13
and i am talking now too at the same time. %$* 13
so i'm going to be quiet. %$* 13
i'm going to give you 20 seconds to make that point, and then i want to hear back. %$* 13
so a succinct 20 seconds. %$* 13
when you look at the extremist-- %$* 331
the organizations that we've come to call extremist, where they're advocating, when they answer the question what went wrong, we had this empire, we lost it, how do we regain it? %$* 331
their answer is a rebirth. %$* 331
let's go back to the origins, a revival of it. %$* 331
is that what you want, zeba? %$* 331
no. %$* 330
they actually co-opt the language for their own political purposes. %$* 330
al-qaeda is not calling for a return to islam or to original islam or anything like that. %$* 330
they're actually using islam as a cover for their political grievances. %$* 330
when you look at and ask muslims, ask 1.5 billion muslims, when you look at the mainstream, they're 90 percent. %$* 330
they're peaceful and fine. %$* 330
when you look at the politically radicalized, when you ask them what do they fear most? %$* 330
they say western domination and occupation. %$* 330
but when you ask mainstream muslims what they fear, they say economic issues, unemployment. %$* 330
there's a clear difference. %$* 330
and so they are not-- %$* 330
what we can determine from that is it's not religion because religiosity between the two is indistinguishable, how pious they are, indistinguishable. %$* 330
it's the one factor that makes the difference is what they focus on and their grievances against-- %$* 330
perceived grievances against the west. %$* 330
douglas murray. %$* 13
but don't we get back to one of the core problems which you still haven't addressed, which is the life of mohammad and his teachings, which is as follows. %$* 333
if a christian group decides to go back to the teachings of christ, you know, the worst stuff they find is the sermon on the mount of olive. %$* 333
they find one verse where jesus is saying, i think in the gospel of matthew, to have said “i come not to bring peace but a sword.” but the rest of it is all love thy neighbor and all that sort of stuff. %$* 333
if you're a christian group looking to go back to the sources of christianity, you just find a lot of, well, hippie stuff, for a lot of modern people. %$* 333
so what is it about this religion we're talking about tonight that you say is a religion of peace, that when people go back to the origins, they find a founder who was violent, teaching violence. %$* 333
see, this comes back to what you mean by people going back to the origins. %$* 332
and i refuse, as does zeba, and as we're asking for all of you to do, is to refuse for islam to be hijacked and monopolized by the bin ladens of this world who want to tell you what it means to go back to the original sources. %$* 332
now, if that was the case, then i ask you why is it that in bangladesh, where there was a free and fair election, the islamist party lost roundly. %$* 332
they completely lost the elections. %$* 332
in pakistan, where there were recent elections, the islamist alliance in the north that came to prominence after the occupation of afghanistan, they completely lost all their seats. %$* 332
so the muslims in two of the most populous muslim majority countries in the world, as like as is the case in indonesia, whenever they have a chance to vote, they do not vote for the islamist extremists. %$* 332
and time and time again in elections across muslim majority states, they have proven that their interpretation of islam-- %$* 332
and they are the majority-- %$* 332
is not the interpretation of douglas, ayaan and bin laden. %$* 332
now, i don't want to be in that camp. %$* 332
all right. %$* 13
i want to take a little break and move on to the topic and the status of women in islam. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
this is an intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts in new york city. %$* 13
our motion is “islam is a religion of peace.” we have two teams of two. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, zeba khan and maajid nawaz. %$* 13
and arguing against the motion, ayaan hirsi ali and douglas murray. %$* 13
one of the-- %$* 13
here in the west, one of the issues that is very complicated for people in coming to terms with what they think islam is, is the status of women in islam. %$* 13
i'd like to go to zeba khan. %$* 13
take that on. %$* 13
you know what i'm talking about. %$* 13
the perception is that for a lot of people looking at the muslim world in muslim majority countries is that muslim women are somehow-- %$* 330
they aren't-- %$* 330
they're subjugated, that they don't-- %$* 330
to a point where they are intimidated to ask for their rights and to demand them. %$* 330
but that's not the case. %$* 330
i mean, when you look at all-- %$* 330
when you look across muslim majority countries, if you look at iran, for example, where there is zero gender gap in education, by the way-- %$* 330
men and women enjoy the same amount of education. %$* 330
obviously when you're at that level of education, you're aware of what your rights are and what you are demanding. %$* 330
and so in iran and places like that, they are demanding their rights, they are pushing for them. %$* 330
in places like afghanistan or pakistan where the gender gap is larger, that gap obviously needs to be filled. %$* 330
but there are women who are pushing there as well. %$* 330
it's women that are stepping up and taking the lead on this. %$* 330
other side response? %$* 13
ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 13
well, when i tried to define islam as a religion, religion there is expression, you find in the koran is expression after expression, verse after verse, and also in the hadith, that women are subordinate to men, that they have a guardian-- %$* 331
they need to have a guardian, their testimony is worth half of that of men, they can only inherit half of what their brother inherits. %$* 331
when it comes to sexual offenses, women are the ones who get-- %$* 331
in reality, where sharia is implemented, and that is not only the practical side of islam but also the fellowship side of islam-- %$* 331
everywhere where sharia is implemented, and there are more places in the world today where sharia as a family law is implemented and where it's not implemented on a political level, but in all of those places you see a subjugation of women. %$* 331
you see honor killings. %$* 331
you see women who are denied education. %$* 331
if you look on a global level, levels of illiteracy among women in the middle east is appalling. %$* 331
that's not something that i'm telling you because i misunderstand islam, but that is report after report, and the latest one is the united nations, the undp human development report that was first published in 2002 and was again published in 2003, 2004. %$* 331
and if you follow these reports, this is empirics-- %$* 331
this is not something that i'm imagining-- %$* 331
the situation of women in the middle east in muslim countries is dire. %$* 331
and the principles that underlie it and the practices are islamic, it's sharia law in action. %$* 331
and the appalling-- %$* 331
the nightmare is women who have fled those countries who are now in the west-- %$* 331
american citizens, european citizens, are subjected to parts of sharia law. %$* 331
and zeba, i think that denying that-- %$* 331
not just as a matter of debate but, i then try to question, "where does your solidarity lie as a woman who grew up in a free country, a free woman, and as vocal as you are, shouldn't you be more solidaire with them? %$* 331
i am. %$* 330
zeba khan. %$* 13
i am. %$* 330
but i don't want to-- %$* 330
i absolutely am and as all women should be and all human beings should demand the rights of equality. %$* 330
in fact, most muslims want equal rights for the women in their societies, and just go to the research, go to the polls, go to the research and what it says. %$* 330
when you ask men, "should women have equal rights? %$* 330
" majority in countries surveyed in the gallup survey said, "yes, they should have equal rights," including in saudi arabia. %$* 330
maajid nawaz. %$* 13
i want to acknowledge that there-- %$* 332
a lot more needs to be done and a lot more needs to be said about eliminating some of the practices that you referred to, ayaan. %$* 332
and i recognize that there are practices in muslim majority societies across the world that are repugnant not just to a western mind but generally to any decent rational human being. %$* 332
but i'm going to approach this being a man, and the first man on the panel to call in on this question, i want to approach this from a slightly different angle, and that is this, that many of you in the audience are men, and if the law of average was to fall true, then you'd be probably around 50 percent. %$* 332
now, how many of you would be comfortable with your spouse, your wife as your boss at the same time? %$* 332
and it may sound-- %$* 332
you know, it may actually be a truism because for many people in a marriage the boss is the wife, but - - the reason i'm asking that question is that even in times like today, many men find that uncomfortable, to be married to their boss, and yet ayaan, who referred to these practices that were repugnant to us and said that they are sourced in islam, the founder of islam, the prophet, mohammad, his boss-- %$* 332
his first wife was his boss. %$* 332
and many people don't know that. %$* 332
and so what i want to demonstrate by this point is that it's a complex matter. %$* 332
there are practices in muslim majority societies that we need to reform, but it's too simplistic to trace them back to the life of a man who lived 1,400 years ago. %$* 332
and in many of these practices, what's quite revolutionary for his time, and in others was like every other man during his time. %$* 332
the fact that he referred to-- %$* 332
douglas refers to the fact that he had a bride that was underage, is something which we can now look back on and say, "that was an awful practice," but just as we look back on many things the romans did and say that was an awful practice, just as we look back on many things martin luther did and say that was an awful practice, but we don’t judge these men by the standards that we have today. %$* 332
yeah, we do, we should. %$* 333
we should, maajid, and may i say it’s a bit too cutesy to compare a man who raped a 9-year-old girl repeatedly with men being kind of, you know, kind of the wife, the bit of the wife being the master of the household and so on. %$* 333
a bit too cutesy. %$* 333
a bit too much of avoiding the issue, which is this. %$* 333
this is actually a very real concern which doesn’t just apply in mid-7th century arabia but today, here and now, in britain, in my own country. %$* 333
we now have, thanks to an arbitration act put into law in 1990, whereby people can have civil disputes arbitrated under laws they can decide on. %$* 333
but we now have sharia courts in great britain and sharia courts in great britain are operated by people who are, actually, clerics, they are religious authorities. %$* 333
there’s one, well, sadiqi in leicester. %$* 333
now this man runs a separate sharia court. %$* 333
a couple of years ago it turned out that we found out about the sort of thing he was deciding, and sadly, again, it’s not reformist stuff, because when you go back to the sharia, people take lessons from it and they make judgments like the following. %$* 333
six women, six women who had gone to the sharia court because they were being physically abused by their husbands, they were persuaded to drop the cases because this should be a matter between a muslim woman and muslim husband in a sharia court. %$* 333
this should not be a matter for the police in great britain in 2008. that stinks. %$* 333
what’s more, there had been another case. %$* 333
a local man, a local muslim man, died. %$* 333
his will was arbitrated by sharia because that is what happens now in 21st century britain. %$* 333
and the arbitration of this man’s will gave half the inheritance to the daughters as to the sons of the man, because that’s what they have in the koran. %$* 333
maajid said that he agrees with you that this stuff needs to change. %$* 13
yeah, the point is that when you look at the courts that are doing this, when you look at the religious authorities, when you look at the clerics the judgments they’re making, those are the kind of judgments. %$* 333
i wish that maajid would get some clerics on his side who could set up rival sharia courts that didn’t decide that women were second class citizens but sadly at the moment that is the case. %$* 333
but douglas, the irony was, as you know well, the person who came out most publicly in support of those regrettable sharia courts in the u.k.was the archbishop of canterbury. %$* 332
and we at quilliam opposed their creation, and actually many muslims in britain do oppose them because it raises a question. %$* 332
islam has never had a clergy. %$* 332
it’s never had a pope. %$* 332
and so when you try and institute sharia courts as law, the question arises, whose sharia do you follow? %$* 332
now that’s an internal debate that’s going on and raging and that i am part of in pakistan for example, because there isn’t one version of sharia and everything you’ve referred to is bad. %$* 332
we condemn these practices. %$* 332
the fact is we can’t call them-- %$* 332
we can’t be reductionist, essentialist, simplistic, and call it sharia because there isn’t on sharia as you well know, just as there isn’t one reading of shakespeare. %$* 332
i want to move on and when we come back we’re going to take questions from the audience. %$* 13
all right, so we’re going to take questions from the audience now and if you raise your hand, what i’ll do is i’ll take a cluster of questions and then start presenting them to the panel. %$* 13
and i just want to remind you, if you get a microphone, please stand up and hold it about two-fifths away from your mouth so that the radio can pick you up. %$* 13
and please keep it as terse as possible. %$* 13
right against the wall there, and blue shirt here, and eyeglasses. %$* 13
three. %$* 13
so, you get 30 seconds to ask your question. %$* 13
it makes me nervous that you’ve got something written down on a piece of paper. %$* 13
under 30 seconds. %$* 18
i promise. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
zeba, in your opening remarks you said that islamic terrorists are motivated by politics, not religion. %$* 18
considering that islamic terrorists make up the majority of suicide terrorists in the world today, what’s happening to muslims politically that isn’t happening to any other major religious group that can account for the disproportionate amount of terrorism coming out of the islamic world? %$* 18
bingo. %$* 13
that was a good question. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 330
yes, that was a great question. %$* 330
you’re number-- %$* 13
i’m going to take the questions and then you’re going to-- %$* 13
oh, sorry. %$* 330
yes, yeah, i’m ready for you. %$* 13
oh, i’m sorry. %$* 13
there, with the microphone. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
this has to do with the muslim community’s reaction to suicide bombing. %$* 18
you stated there’s 1.5 billion muslims and yet the silence of this community on suicide bombing, the justification, the rationalization, the wiggles from the community, from the religious community, from the muslim states, arab states and muslim states, is something that, in the west, we find puzzling. %$* 18
how would the panelists react to that? %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
and third question? %$* 13
i hope this isn't too naive, but if religion is-- %$* 19
if islam is not a religion of peace, is it possible for it to become one? %$* 19
well, i think that's a great question, actually. %$* 13
i was trying to get at that with the reform issue, but i just think you put it far more eloquently. %$* 13
so i'm going to take all those questions because i thought they were all good. %$* 13
zeba, do you want to take the response to the first one, basically, why is the preponderance of terrorism-- %$* 13
the question you were saying-- %$* 13
is committed by muslim extremists; why are we not seeing that happening from other groups? %$* 13
so what i don't-- %$* 330
i can't say is-- %$* 330
i know that it's a complicated question. %$* 330
and so you have history involved. %$* 330
you have different factors that contribute to the answer. %$* 330
what i can say for sure, just based on looking at the studies that come out, is that the level of religiosity, the level of piety, of violent terrorists compared to mainstream muslims is virtually there's no difference. %$* 330
so it's literally when you ask them how practicing they are, how often do they attend services, things like that, it's literally the same. %$* 330
so that can't be the distinguishing factor. %$* 330
what we do know, as i mentioned earlier, is when you ask them-- %$* 330
the one big difference is when you ask them what they fear the most, and they say their perceived idea of western domination, which is very similar to what we hear from our opposition, a perceived fear of islamic domination. %$* 330
and so when you compare that to the mainstream who just want to get a job and-- %$* 330
would the other side like to respond to that question as well, or to the answer that you heard? %$* 13
and if not, we'll move on. %$* 13
we'll-- %$* 331
i'll move on. %$* 331
can i just add something? %$* 332
sure. %$* 13
nawaz. %$* 13
i think just to add something, that it's-- %$* 332
the preponderance has a lot to do with the spread of a certain ideology that i refer to as islamism that has arisen in the post-colonial context and that was exported to the middle east through geopolitics. %$* 332
now, what happened was that there was a need for a cause to resist against colonialism. %$* 332
and britain was a secular liberal country. %$* 332
the cause of the ideology that the arabs adopted, who were resisting initially, was arab socialism, baathism. %$* 332
and that morphed into islamism, which owes much of its origins to arab socialism. %$* 332
and so what we find is that the spread of this ideology, pretty much like how post world war i europe, with the identity crisis that emerged after the weimar republic led to the growth of fascism in europe, with fascism in italy, naziism in germany and totalitarian stalinism in the ussr. %$* 332
we see the same thing playing out post empire in the middle east. %$* 332
so what it's related to is the spread of this ideology that has hijacked the minds of many young muslims. %$* 332
and yes, muslims need to do more to challenge this ideology. %$* 332
we are trying to convince them of that. %$* 332
but this is a very modern phenomenon. %$* 332
and i remind you, khomeini is a modern phenomenon, and he created a revolution where he flipped shiite theology on its head, as are the others, bin laden, sayyid qutb, they are all modern phenomenon. %$* 332
okay, maajid, you have awakened the other side on this topic. %$* 13
yes, because what-- %$* 331
should have kept my mouth shut. %$* 332
ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 13
maajid, what you are saying is islamism is invented by the british, islamism has nothing to do with islam. %$* 331
external, external, external, those poor muslims who are seduced with the koran and the activities of mohammad, their own culture, their own convictions, their own history, they have-- %$* 331
you know-- %$* 331
they are only the victims. %$* 331
ideas inspire. %$* 331
ideas unite. %$* 331
ideas people bring together. %$* 331
and mohammad succeeded first and foremost in uniting a disparate bedouin desert arab group of people. %$* 331
and they unified, and they conquered. %$* 331
and when it worked, it was all islam. %$* 331
when muslims were successful, when they conquered lands, it was all great. %$* 331
it was islam. %$* 331
now that we are faced with this problem, it's islamism. %$* 331
it was created by the british empire. %$* 331
i just want for the other side-- %$* 331
i don't think we will ever be able to address this issue if we systematically refuse to acknowledge, and that is what that side of the panel is doing. %$* 331
no. %$* 13
ayaan-- %$* 13
to-- %$* 331
let me finish it. %$* 331
yep. %$* 13
to systematically-- %$* 331
systematically refuse to acknowledge the flaws of islam. %$* 331
i grew up as a muslim. %$* 331
i left islam. %$* 331
why did it do it? %$* 331
because i couldn't hide away from the blemishes. %$* 331
and i believe we can improve that. %$* 331
i can believe we can inspire young muslims and the youth bulge-- %$* 331
there are millions and millions of young muslim men under the age of 30. %$* 331
that in itself is a source of violence. %$* 331
i want to-- %$* 13
we can inspire them if we can only acknowledge that part of the problem is us, not just the british empire. %$* 331
i'm not saying it's the fault of the british. %$* 332
if i was going to say that, i would have joined a very successful british law firm-- %$* 332
what has islamism got to do with islam? %$* 331
i'm saying to you i would have been a lawyer, and i would have gone on with my life. %$* 332
i'm taking responsibility for that, and i'm trying to get others to take responsibility for the growth of islamism within muslim mind and challenge that. %$* 332
so no one's blaming the british, and no one's-- %$* 332
islamism is not islam. %$* 331
the second question was on the topic of-- %$* 13
and you almost got to it in your last answer, maajid. %$* 13
but the second question is where is the clear-cut, broad condemnation of terrorism from muslim leaders? %$* 13
so there have been many, many such fatwas or pronouncements against suicide bombings. %$* 332
in many cases, they're not reported. %$* 332
there does need to be more. %$* 332
however, i'll give you an example of why, in some cases, there aren't more. %$* 332
now, recently, we at quilliam publicized a fatwa by dr. %$* 332
tahir-ul-qadri against terrorism, no ifs, no buts condemnation of suicide bombing and terrorism that douglas-- %$* 332
always a pleasure to speak with you on the panel-- %$* 332
supported and was quoted in the press as supporting dr. %$* 332
tahir-ul-qadri’s fatwa against terrorism. %$* 332
now, the reason why there aren't many more such examples, though there are quite a few, is because prior to dr. %$* 332
tahir-ul-qadri issuing this fatwa, his colleague, who was also from the same way of thinking, was assassinated in pakistan, was killed by a suicide bomber in a mosque where all the congregants who were praying were also blown to smithereens because he had the guts to simply give a sermon in that mosque condemning suicide bombings. %$* 332
and so this is why many people are scared, because it takes guts, i tell you, to go into pakistan and try and challenge these extremists. %$* 332
that's a country that doesn't have much rule of law. %$* 332
it's a country that's struggling against the so-called pakistani taliban from taking over a third of their country. %$* 332
and they're fighting that fight on the front lines. %$* 332
and there are those who are brave enough just to give a speech to condemn terrorism, and they're blown to smithereens in their mosque while praying. %$* 332
maajid. %$* 333
and surely, they're religious people. %$* 332
they were praying in a mosque. %$* 332
you did support that fatwa. %$* 332
i did. %$* 333
it's the only time i've ever done a book review of a fatwa. %$* 333
the-- %$* 333
i'm sorry to say, maajid, you seem to have just proved our point. %$* 333
yes. %$* 331
am i-- %$* 333
please explain. %$* 332
is it-- %$* 333
i mean, this is a very important and a very interesting question why more people don't stand up. %$* 333
i much admire tahir-ul-qadri for that fatwa, as i have other people who have stood up. %$* 333
for the number of times i have spoken behind closed doors and so on, and you say, why aren't you saying anything, they say because if i do speak up, i'll be killed. %$* 333
well, i address you again, ladies and gentlemen, to the motion. %$* 333
i'm sorry. %$* 332
sorry. %$* 332
hang on. %$* 332
hang on. %$* 332
how on earth-- %$* 332
how on earth does fear of being killed in pakistan by a minority faction of extremists prove islam is not a religion of peace? %$* 332
well, let me put it this way-- %$* 333
let me put it this way then. %$* 333
it takes-- %$* 332
no, sorry. %$* 332
sorry. %$* 332
i've got to-- %$* 332
because really, what you just said is really quite absurd. %$* 332
and i've got to clarify. %$* 332
it takes one person to kill all of us here, one person in a suicide bombing. %$* 332
now, if we were scared of saying what we're saying now because of that one person, it doesn't mean all of us love war and hate peace in any way whatsoever. %$* 332
it means we all fear that one person who could walk through that door with a suicide bomb jacket strapped to his chest. %$* 332
but maajid, if we were discussing-- %$* 333
that's an absurd argument, douglas. %$* 332
here tonight, does anyone think that when a quaker said, i am quite fearful about speaking up against certain things, and i say-- %$* 333
come on, this only happens with islam. %$* 333
there is no other major faith in the world today-- %$* 333
for that to be true-- %$* 332
where it is the case that people are fearful of addressing religion because they're afraid they'll be killed. %$* 333
for that to be true-- %$* 332
it's only islam. %$* 333
and we're saying there's a reason. %$* 333
i'm afraid of being killed by apostates. %$* 331
and many of you who came here tonight came under unusual circumstances. %$* 331
i am not in government. %$* 331
i am not a powerful person. %$* 331
i am a citizen. %$* 331
i mean, just a normal ordinary-- %$* 331
can you explain what you mean by unusual circumstances? %$* 13
unusual circumstances. %$* 331
you went through metal detectors to come to a debate in new york. %$* 331
i mean, talk about %$* 331
that's because it takes one person to get through those metal detectors and blow us up. %$* 332
let me finish. %$* 331
let me finish. %$* 331
it doesn't mean the majority of people are terrorists. %$* 332
let me finish. %$* 331
let me finish. %$* 331
the people that i am protected against, and you as an audience, too, the individual who wants to kill me because i am an apostate of islam is in inspired to do that from the scripture of islam, the example of the prophet mohammad, the clergy that preached to him and the reward he will get in the hereafter that is promised in the koran. %$* 331
all of that is islamic. %$* 331
the sooner you admit that-- %$* 331
i'll tell you what he's inspired by-- %$* 332
the sooner i can get rid of my bodyguard. %$* 331
he's inspired. %$* 332
i'll you what he's inspired by-- %$* 332
right. %$* 332
wanted to have the last word on this point because i want to go back to the young lady's question. %$* 13
sure. %$* 332
so i he's inspired by the very same interpretation of islam that you have. %$* 332
he's not inspired by islam. %$* 332
he's inspired by your interpretation of it that is bin laden's interpretation of it. %$* 332
i'm sorry-- %$* 331
and i'm got to say one last thing. %$* 332
no. %$* 331
wait, wait, wait. %$* 331
nothing. %$* 332
no, no, no, no. %$* 331
the thing is you're not the one-- %$* 332
the only one on this panel, i have an al-qaeda death threat on my head, too, because i'm saying what i'm saying. %$* 332
and what i am saying is that-- %$* 332
and i've been attacked in pakistan physically for saying this-- %$* 332
what i'm saying is, enough to extremism, enough to terrorism, let's separate islam from extremism and disempower the minority of extremists who are trying to hijack a good faith. %$* 332
of course, i mean, one of the points about it there is that one gets death threats. %$* 333
i mean, it's just an unfortunate thing %$* 333
i think zeba and i are going to leave %$* 13
i think it speaks for itself. %$* 333
i hope no one threatens the chair. %$* 333
can you repeat the question that i liked so much? %$* 13
if islam is not a religion of peace, is it possible for it to become one? %$* 19
my answer is yes, on condition that first of all islam is not a religion of peace, and i hope that we've demonstrated here tonight that it's not. %$* 331
can it become a religion of peace? %$* 331
yes, if a number of conditions are met. %$* 331
but what is it, for all of the people who practice it peacefully? %$* 13
but let me complete the condition-- %$* 331
but what is that faith that they're practicing, then? %$* 13
and not only practice it peacefully, but we-- %$* 330
that's the part that i'm not finding in your explanation. %$* 13
why are we having again, over and over again-- %$* 331
first of all, in my view no monotheistic religion because there is that divider between "we" and "they" and because when that unified-- %$* 331
when there are so many factors within every monotheistic religion that make it inherently aggressive, it's not only islam, but there are a number of factors that in the 21st century combine-- %$* 331
again, there is the history of militarism and the awareness of that, there is the victim status, there is the youth bulge, let's not forget that, there is the revival of that theology, the revival of the example of the prophet mohammad, the investment in the hereafter. %$* 331
and you say a lot of people practice their religion in peace. %$* 331
what we know is that a lot of people are passive and actually not practicing their faith, are not practicing islamic scripture-- %$* 331
who are you to say who's practicing-- %$* 330
let me finish-- %$* 331
let me finish-- %$* 331
their faith and who's not? %$* 330
let me finish, %$* 331
it's not for you to decide. %$* 330
i'm the muslim, you're not. %$* 330
but let me finish. %$* 331
let me finish. %$* 331
you are not practicing-- %$* 331
you are not practicing, let me-- %$* 331
really? %$* 330
are you %$* 330
no, but let me say, you are not practicing-- %$* 331
let's hear what she says %$* 13
wait a minute, i want to finish. %$* 331
please, let's hear what her point is. %$* 13
you are not practicing chapter 2 of the koran, verse 191 and 193, "and slay them wherever you find them, and drive them out of places whence they drove you out, for persecution of muslims is worse than the slaughter of the nonbeliever." %$* 331
chapter 2, "let there be no compulsion in religion." %$* 330
you are not-- %$* 331
you are not-- %$* 331
chapter 2, "each community-- %$* 330
yeah, okay, what is that-- %$* 331
okay, great, i love that. %$* 331
"-- %$* 330
which has given direction as it follows, all of you compete in the performance of good deeds." %$* 330
which proves my point %$* 331
this could go on for a long time-- %$* 13
let me one person speak at a time and you will come back-- %$* 13
that proves my point. %$* 331
if you read the peaceful-- %$* 331
start again because i was talking. %$* 13

look. %$* 611
i could understand why-- %$* 611
philip bobbitt. %$* 13
you want to talk about libya. %$* 611
i could understand why you want talk about the president. %$* 611
but this debate is not about libya, and the president is not here debating with professor amar and i. %$* 611
actually, this debate is about whether the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 609
true. %$* 611
and i am quite happy to take it on that stand. %$* 611
if you find that the president has exceeded congressional authorization, that he needs a declaration of war-- %$* 611
that the congressional authorization was ill-considered, that he is going to them now because he thinks he doesn't have the authority-- %$* 611
a charge that was just made, which is not the way i read the president's statements-- %$* 611
he's been quite clear-- %$* 611
i didn't say that. %$* 609
that he does not need this authority, which is the way i read it. %$* 611
i'll leave it to you. %$* 611
he can-- %$* 611
he already has it. %$* 612
yeah. %$* 611
if you believe this-- %$* 611
if you believe that the funding was just a lark, it has nothing to do with authorizing the war, that congress is being gulled into this, well, then you should vote for our opponents. %$* 611
professor bobbitt, you have a pretty broad view of what appropriations authorize. %$* 609
if i-- %$* 609
looking at the foreign policy article that you-- %$* 609
that is on the intelligence squared website, i believe you said in 2013 that the very fact that congress funded bunker busters meant that they couldn't be surprised if the president decided to launch them against syria. %$* 609
isn't that a pretty broad view of-- %$* 609
it's sort of if i lease my-- %$* 609
if i give my employee a company car i should not be able to complain if he takes it on a joyride. %$* 609
maybe not, but if you give him a tank you shouldn't be surprised if he-- %$* 611
if he uses it to invade another country? %$* 609
if he doesn't go to the movies with it. %$* 611
one more question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
this is for the ‘against’ side. %$* 18
you seem to be saying that congress has provided authority, but also should provide additional authority for strikes against isis. if congress does vote on a new authorization and that authorization doesn't pass, where does the president's authority stand at that point? %$* 18
does that change the game? %$* 13
akhil amar. %$* 13
well, it all depends on what it says, but our position is congress already has spoken, and spoken about as clearly as it is possible to speak in the english language. %$* 612
so a new resolution refusing to extend the president's authority to isil by name would still leave him empowered by the 2001 authorization? %$* 13
well, the way to change law in our system is to pass a new one, and it's possible-- %$* 612
it's very easy to pass a new resolution that passes the house and passes the senate, and is signed by the president that says the 2001 authorization of the use of military force is hereby repealed, and section two can say, “and in its place the following shall be the rules,” and the rules could have tighter restrictions on scope of hostilities. %$* 612
they could have sunset provisions. %$* 612
they could have all sorts of stuff, just like you can have a new tax law or a new antitrust law, or any new statute really on any topic where congress has already legislated it. %$* 612
is he right about that analysis, deborah pearlstein? %$* 13
well, is he right about, it'll depend what the new authorization says? %$* 610
it'll certainly depend what the new authorization says, right, but part of the necessity for a new authorization, and indeed i think part of the reason, and i know we're not debating the administration, but the fact is even the president, if we are deferring to his judgment, thinks we should have a new authorization. %$* 610
part of the purpose for that is to clarify exactly what we're doing and against whom we're doing it. %$* 610
and i think the sort of notion that the 2001 aumf was sufficient to get us through pretty much anyone in that messy middle east because they're close enough is not only a legal error, it's a strategic error of the most profound sense. %$* 610
we don't want to lump them together. %$* 610
they're different groups, and if we do that we only strengthen both of them. %$* 610
i think it's that strategic error that the president is most worried about. %$* 610
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is: the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
and now we're going to move on to round three. %$* 13
remember, how you voted in the first round. %$* 13
immediately after the summary statements, you'll vote again and then we'll declare our winner. %$* 13
onto round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each and here-- %$* 13
you can sit down for all of these. %$* 13
here to summarize his position in support of the motion that the president has exceeded his authority, gene healy, vice president of the cato institute and author of "the cult of the presidency." %$* 13
thank you. %$* 609
to agree with our opponents on tonight's motion you'd have to accept some pretty extraordinary propositions. %$* 609
you'd have to believe that the president has not just the power to repel sudden attacks, but the right to launch them. %$* 609
you'd have to accept the proposition that three days after september 11, congress delegated its war powers to the president in near perpetuity, one congress, one vote, one time; and that that war can be conducted for decades to come on a need-to-know basis with minimal public debate. %$* 609
you'd have to swallow the notion that seven months of regime change bombing in libya isn't war for constitutional purposes. %$* 609
it isn't even hostilities under the war powers resolution, so long as-- %$* 609
and this is the actual argument they've made, the administration that is-- %$* 609
it's not hostility so long as the country we're bombing can't easily hit us back. %$* 609
that last one has what i think are pretty staggering implications in an age of remote controlled warfare. %$* 609
it's also, i have to say, a somewhat grotesque doctrine for a humane, internationalist president to advance. %$* 609
put starkly, it says, "killing a bunch of foreigners isn't war; war is what happens when actual americans might get hurt. %$* 609
then it's serious. %$* 609
you might even need congressional authorization,” unless, of course, our president thinks there's an emergency threat to our humanitarian values, as in libya. %$* 609
well, our constitutional values demand debate and authorization before the resort to deadly force. %$* 609
they demand a vote. %$* 609
tonight, please vote, "yes," on the motion, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." thank you. %$* 609
thank you, gene healy. %$* 13
and with that being the motion, akhil amar, professor at yale law school, and author of "america's unwritten constitution: the precedents and principles we live by," is here with his closing statement. %$* 13
so you've heard it suggested by our distinguished opponents that the president can't go after isil because it's a different group than al-qaeda. %$* 612
and you've heard questions about, "well, how similar this has to be? %$* 612
" here's at least one just very basic point that has gone unrebutted for the entire conversation. %$* 612
some of the leaders of isil were the leaders of al-qaeda on 9/11. %$* 612
and that's not true of norway or the new york yankees or brooklyn or the leaders of china, for that matter. %$* 612
so the authorization of the use of military force that congress passed was not limited, didn't mention al-qaeda by name. %$* 612
it talked about other organizations that may have aided or harbored al-qaeda, either before or after the fact. %$* 612
it said, "its purpose is to prevent future attacks." it has no sunset provision, and yes, these folks are sometimes at odds with each other. %$* 612
frankly, that's what winning a war means: that you want to divide the folks on the other side. %$* 612
you want to have sufficient military strength so that they start to squabble amongst themselves. %$* 612
that's actually how you win these conflicts and serve the ultimate purposes that are emphatically authorized by congress, preventing this from happening again by affiliates of the same organizations that hit new york the first time. %$* 612
thank you, akhil amar. %$* 13
and the motion is, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." and here to argue in her closing statement in support of the motion, deborah pearlstein, a cardozo law professor, and former director of the law and security program at human rights first. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 610
so i would like to know the names of the members of isil that were part of al- qaeda when it attacked us at 9/11. the leader of isil, al-baghdadi, right, was radicalized when the united states invaded iraq after 9/11, another nation that was not responsible for the attacks of 9/11. i think the fundamental point as this, right? %$* 610
there is a difference between al- qaeda and isil, enough of a difference that there needs to be new authorization, and the president himself, the expert that professor bobbitt suggests we look to first, agrees with that, which is why he has gone to congress. %$* 610
more broadly, the framers of the constitution wanted it to be hard to go to war. %$* 610
they imposed a series of checks in order to make it hard. %$* 610
we were going to have appropriations for military funding in the full view of god and everyone every two years. %$* 610
the constitution requires it. %$* 610
now we fund military operations substantially through funding contractors; through different departments, the funding is hidden. %$* 610
they wanted citizens to be-- %$* 610
to serve in the military. %$* 610
these days about .5 percent of americans serve in the military. %$* 610
80 percent of us support the troops, 90 percent of us can't find afghanistan on a map. %$* 610
congress and congress's ability to say, "this is the war we want to fight, these are the reasons, these are the people"-- %$* 610
congress is one of the last and most significant checks we have of limiting, constraining, in any way slowing the march to war that we might otherwise be inclined to take. %$* 610
the president has asked congress to help us define what that war is. %$* 610
we should keep this one last check. %$* 610
you know, i was briefing some young congressional staffers last week on what this would mean if they passed a new authorization. %$* 610
and they despaired of congress taking any action. %$* 610
you can tell them, "it's not despairing. %$* 610
we think you should take action." vote for the resolution in this debate. %$* 610
thank you, deborah pearlstein. %$* 13
and the debate is this-- %$* 13
the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization. %$* 13
and here, summarizing his position against this motion, philip bobbitt, a columbia law professor, and former director for intelligence at the national security council. %$* 13
why is your vote important tonight? %$* 611
it's because many people in our country have been thoroughly misled into doubting that of which they should be confident: the legal basis for the president's actions against the islamic state; and feel confident about widespread popular opinions of which they should be very dubious. %$* 611
one of those opinions is, the wars in afghanistan, iraq, syria, nigeria, yemen, somalia, and libya have nothing to do with each other; that a global terror network is just a fantasy, full of sound and fury. %$* 611
another is that the congress must adopt a declaration of war, or yet a new authorization, which the president does not say is required, to authorize an otherwise constitutional war. %$* 611
pressure groups have become quite eager to frustrate government action by mobilizing public opinion on the grounds that the obama administration is acting unlawfully. %$* 611
and we've seen this in area after area. %$* 611
we hope you won't be a party to this. %$* 611
the interplay between the president and the congress should not be a game that has the zenith of insight in the question "if that's what you meant, why didn't you say so? %$* 611
" rather, the strategic and moral problems we all know we face should inform on our opinions as well as our decisions. %$* 611
thank you, philip bobbitt. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements in this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." and now, it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to have you again go to the keypads at your seats and vote the same way, same system. %$* 13
push number one if you support this motion. %$* 13
number two if you are against it. %$* 13
number three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
and you can ignore the-- %$* 13
as i said before, you can ignore the keys that are not on the screen, as they're not live. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
and while we're doing that and while the results are tabulated, i want to take a little bit of a break and welcome two gentlemen to the stage, and some chairs are going to miraculously-- %$* 13
well, they're not going to miraculously appear. %$* 13
two guys are going to carry them in. %$* 13
they're angels. %$* 13
please welcome to the stage jeffrey rosen and ed morrison. %$* 13
have a seat. %$* 13
gentlemen, the reason the two of you have been brought up here is because you've been partners for us. %$* 13
normally we-- %$* 13
as i said-- %$* 13
do our debates downtown, but we are delighted to be here at columbia, and invited by the richman center, and to be in this hall which we've been backstage saying is actually a spectacular place to do a debate. %$* 13
and jeffrey rosen, we've been partnering with you on these constitutional debates for some time, normally doing them in philadelphia at the national constitution center, which i want to say, if you have not been to, you should get to. %$* 13
it's a short trip. %$* 13
it's a spectacular place. %$* 13
it's a day out. %$* 13
i mean, it's constitutional amusement park-- %$* 13
constitutional disney world. %$* 13
it's really worth going to do - - going to see. %$* 13
but jeffrey, take a minute to-- %$* 13
just to share with us just this whole notion that you've experienced, this audience has experience-- %$* 13
i'm sure the law professors and law students are used to it-- %$* 13
but that we're taking a slice of this thing that's about the constitution. %$* 13
well, the national constitution center is constitutional heaven. %$* 49
that is what it is. %$* 49
and i believe there's nothing more important in these polarized times than citizens having the opportunity to hear the best arguments on the constitutional questions that are at the heart of the most important questions of our democracy, so that people can make up their own minds. %$* 49
and that's the inspiring mission at the national constitution center was created by congress during the bicentennial of the constitution to promote. %$* 49
our congressional charter says that we have a mission to disseminate information about the u.s.constitution on a non-partisan basis. %$* 49
and when i had the incredible luck of leading this amazing institution about a year-and-a-half ago, i decided-- %$* 49
i asked, "what's the leading forum for, well, intelligent debate in america? %$* 49
"and of course, that's intelligence squared. %$* 49
so i'm a law professor at gw in d.c.i went to go see nick rosenkranz, who teaches at georgetown, and i said we need to start a constitutional debate series so citizens can understand the difference between political arguments and constitutional arguments. %$* 49
and nick said, as you heard in his intro, that's exactly right. %$* 49
there's nothing more important than educating people about the difference between political and constitutional arguments. %$* 49
so we started up this incredibly series and this is the fourth debate we've hosted. %$* 49
i'm so thrilled that it's in new york city. %$* 49
and this model is so successful that it's become the basis for all of our constitutional education. %$* 49
we've persuaded the heads of the federalist society, the leading conservative lawyers organization in the country, and the american constitutional society, the leading liberal organization to co-chair an advisory board of the national constitutional center. %$* 49
nick-- %$* 49
that is worth an applause. %$* 49
i think it's thrilling. %$* 49
i think there's nothing more exciting than seeing these two great organizations joining together for civilized debate, and nick is also co-chairing this board. %$* 49
and last week in washington we launched the series of a national series of town hall constitutional debates that i think are going to be like the lincoln-douglas debates, and transform discourse in america. %$* 49
and we're having these we the people podcasts for constitutional debate that also bring together the top liberals and conservatives. %$* 49
and we're creating the best interactive constitution on the web, summoning top liberal, conservative, and libertarian scholars to write about every clause of the constitution, both what they agree about and what they disagree about. %$* 49
but for all of this our partnership with intelligence squared is the core of this model, and it's really a model of faith that believes that people are intelligent enough that when they hear good arguments on both sides, they'll engage, they might separate their political and constitutional views, they might even change their minds, and that's why i'm so eager to hear the vote. %$* 49
i'm so thrilled to be in new york, and please join us for the next of our constitutional debates june 2 in philadelphia. %$* 49
do the states have the constitutional authority to define marriage? %$* 49
that debate is going to be right before the supreme court decides that question later in june, and it's going to be an amazing discussion, just as this one was. %$* 49
also, you and nick rosenkranz have something else in common and it's that guy over there. %$* 13
oh, well, akhil amar was my first teacher in law school and he's the greatest teacher that i've ever had and a great friend, and he did a great job tonight along with all the other debaters. %$* 49
okay. %$* 13
now it's time for ed morrison. %$* 13
he's co-director of the richard paul richman center for business, law, and public policy here at columbia. %$* 13
we are delighted to be here with you, but why are you delighted to be here with us? %$* 13
well, tonight's debate is a terrific example of why we do what we do at columbia university. %$* 613
it's why we do research. %$* 613
it's why we teach. %$* 613
most, i think all of us at columbia are here to engage in a deep way with policy makers, with the media, with industry-- %$* 613
frankly with you about the issues of our day. %$* 613
and one of our earliest graduates, think of alexander hamilton, he used debates like tonight to shape the way an early america thought about the issues of its time. %$* 613
and frankly those issues are not so dissimilar from what we talked about tonight. %$* 613
through his words, through his debates, he permanently changed the way we think about the scope of federal authority, the scope, the conflict between congress and the president. %$* 613
it's what we're debating tonight. %$* 613
it's the hamiltonian style of debate that we at columbia crave, and yet it's all too rare. %$* 613
newspapers want sound bites. %$* 613
they call me all the time for them. %$* 613
and you don't give them. %$* 13
and i don't give them. %$* 613
i try not to. %$* 613
i'm not good at it. %$* 613
the op-eds. %$* 613
they want 300 to 500 words. %$* 613
tweets are becoming the common currency. %$* 613
that's our world, but yet then there's iq squared, and it provides the forum that i think we at columbia crave, which is an opportunity to engage with you in a deep way about issues that really matter. %$* 613
weren't the questions good tonight? %$* 13
they were. %$* 613
they were terrific. %$* 613
i have to say they're not always that good. %$* 13
they were really good. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 613
i'm the director of the richard paul richman center for business law and public policy at columbia university. %$* 613
it's a joint effort of a law and business school to engage with the public in an evidence-based, deep way-- %$* 613
this kind of conversation we had tonight-- %$* 613
and it's why we were just so thrilled to be able to host this kind of debate. %$* 613
it's exactly what we want to achieve at columbia. %$* 613
and i also want to extend a thank you to richard richmand and geoffrey colvin, who are here tonight, whose support made this debate possible. %$* 613
thank you from us as well. %$* 13
gentlemen, %$* 13
one last thing. %$* 613
i know i'm taking up your air time, but the last thing i want to say and i want you all to remember this, is that i hope tonight's debate has convinced you to come back. %$* 613
come back to columbia university, because we'd love to have you join us in our ongoing i think pretty exciting conversations about issues that matter. %$* 613
and you should do the soundbites. %$* 13
i mean, you're-- %$* 13
you should go with that. %$* 13
gentlemen, thank you very much. %$* 13
and, again, thank you to both of you for one other thing about upcoming debates, i want to let you know our intelligence squared debate series moves on. %$* 13
in two weeks, april 15th, we're back at the kaufman center on 67th street. %$* 13
our debate motion that night will be, "abolish the death penalty." and we're not doing that as a constitutional issue, although that will be part of it. %$* 13
it's more of a social issue. %$* 13
we would be delighted to have as many of you come down to that as you can. %$* 13
okay, so it's all in now. %$* 13
i have the final results. %$* 13
the motion is this, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." to remind you, the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the first vote. %$* 13
in the first vote, 27 percent agreed with the motion, 33 percent were against, and 40 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so a high number for us. %$* 13
the second vote went like this: the team arguing for the motion, their vote went from 27 percent to 38 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 11 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let's see the side against the motion. %$* 13
they went from 33 percent to 53 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 20 percentage points. %$* 13
that means the team arguing against the motion has won this debate, the motion being, "the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization." our congratulations to the team that argued against. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, at intelligence squared u.s.we'll see you next time. %$* 13
and we-- %$* 13
all of those invitations you have to all of these upcoming programs, follow through. %$* 13
we'll see you there. %$* 13

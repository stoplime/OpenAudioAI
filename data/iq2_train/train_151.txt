and to introduce the gentleman who makes intelligence squared u.s.possible, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
thank you very much, and welcome. %$* 1
it’s my role in these proceedings to frame the debate, and when we think about the language of tonight’s debate, we think of the american spirit as a pragmatic can-do optimism, the conviction that the future will be better than the past and that we have the power as individuals to create that future. %$* 1
well, we don’t see that spirit shining very brightly in america today. %$* 1
university graduates are struggling to find jobs. %$* 1
unemployed mid-career executives are accepting pay cuts, if they can get jobs at all. %$* 1
corporate profits are at high levels, but very few companies can expect much growth. %$* 1
investors are adjusting to sharply diminished returns from bonds and equities and hedge funds. %$* 1
consumers are in no mood to spend. %$* 1
instead, they are struggling to save, to offset the effects of declining real estate and stock market values. %$* 1
well, to what extent is this the fault of big government? %$* 1
if you’re in the finance sector, or part of the energy complex, or involved in healthcare or pharmaceuticals, it’s hard to think that big government is your friend. %$* 1
these sectors, by the way, account for more than half of all corporate profits. %$* 1
they are dealing with higher capital requirements, costly and intrusive regulation, restrictions on profit margins, and other new impediments to growth. %$* 1
if you create jobs for others you will almost surely fit president obama’s definition of the rich, and if you are rich you are facing substantially higher federal and state income taxes, new healthcare taxes as well, not to mention a barrage of hostile rhetoric from washington. %$* 1
so, what is the counterargument? %$* 1
it’s that free market capitalism was on the verge of collapse when barack obama took office. %$* 1
major financial institutions were on the edge of insolvency. %$* 1
the auto industry was close to bankruptcy. %$* 1
economic output was in freefall. %$* 1
we didn’t have pessimism-- %$* 1
we had panic. %$* 1
only big government could have restored confidence in these circumstances, and indeed it succeeded in pulling us back from the abyss. %$* 1
it did so by making money cheap and abundant, which restored order to stock and bond markets. %$* 1
it provided fiscal stimulus to maintain demand for goods and services. %$* 1
it kept the auto industry out of bankruptcy, saving hundreds of thousands of jobs. %$* 1
and it stabilized our financial institutions by requiring them to hold more capital and take less risk. %$* 1
there may well be a long-term price to pay for all of this, but when your house is on fire, the long run doesn’t matter. %$* 1
you need to put the fire out and only big government could have done it. %$* 1
these two viewpoints are central to a deep political divide in america today. %$* 1
which one has greater merit? %$* 1
we have some truly extraordinary panelists with us this evening to help us decide and it’s now my privilege to turn the evening over to john donvan, our moderator. %$* 1
thank you very much. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and i would just like to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
true or false: big government is stifling the american spirit. %$* 13
well let’s have it out right here and right now. %$* 13
welcome, everyone, to another debate from intelligence squared u.s., a contest of ideas, a verbal joust which only one side can win. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news, welcoming you to the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and to hundreds of npr stations across the nation, as these two teams on either side of me, two teams of two try, to win you over. %$* 13
the motion we are debating: big government is stifling the american spirit. %$* 13
and comprising the team that is arguing for this motion, we have phil gramm and art laffer. %$* 13
and i’d like to begin by talking to phil gramm. %$* 13
you are now a banker but you were long ago a professor of economics and in the time in between, you spent two decades in congress where your reputation was made as a senator and congressman who was fighting to release the american taxpayer and the american businessman from the shackles-- %$* 13
shackles the word? %$* 13
shackles of government, you accept that with a nod? %$* 13
and i don’t think many people know this but you know, remember this, but you actually went into congress as a democrat. %$* 13
and it was at the time that you supported the reagan tax cuts in 1981 that your fellow democrats pushed you off of the house budget committee and you switched parties. %$* 13
was that-- %$* 13
as you think back, was that a traumatic event or was your inner republican screaming to get out all along? %$* 13
well, i did more than that. %$* 435
i resigned from congress and i went back home and i ran again because i’d been elected as a democrat and even though i’d been rated as the most conservative member of congress, i wanted people to have a choice as to whether i stayed or not. %$* 435
and i had nine democratic opponents and i beat all nine. %$* 435
art laffer, your partner, is the only member of this panel who has an actual entry in an online dictionary. %$* 13
when you look up laffer curve, this is laffer. %$* 13
made famous in the 1980s as a symbolic representation of the concept that in certain situations, as you lower taxes, government revenue can actually go up. %$* 13
and art, the myth or the story about this is that you actually brought this to the gerald ford white house. %$* 13
you sat down with two young men named dick cheney and don rumsfeld and drew it on a napkin. %$* 13
once and for all, is it true, was there a napkin? %$* 13
yes. %$* 15
you bring any napkins tonight? %$* 13
for a price. %$* 15
oh. %$* 13
your opponents, who are arguing against the motion that big government is stifling the american spirit, i’d like to introduce laura tyson, an economist. %$* 13
your resume has a fair sprinkling of the phrase “first female to,” first female to be dean of the london school of economics, first female chairman of the president’s council of economic advisors, that was in the clinton administration. %$* 13
at mit as a young student, you were the first female to write a 532-page thesis; we do do our research. %$* 13
a 532 page thesis titled inflation in yugoslavia in 1962, 1972, an empirical analysis. %$* 13
oh dear. %$* 436
we all read it. %$* 13
yes, absolutely. %$* 436
a terrific read but %$* 13
mm-hmm. %$* 436
fantastic. %$* 436
in one sentence, why you’re on this side. %$* 13
you know, i really do believe that there are paths that are appropriate for governments to carry out and that citizens wish them to carry them out and that we have to worry about doing them well, but we have to do them. %$* 436
thank you very much. %$* 13
and your partner, nouriel roubini, who famously predicted the housing bubble and then predicted the crisis that followed it, you were right, fortunately for you. %$* 13
this is your second debate with us. %$* 13
you previously debated, where you took the side that the financial crisis should be blamed on washington, not on wall street. %$* 13
you won, overwhelmingly, 60 percent. %$* 13
so you are risking your perfect record by being here tonight. %$* 13
welcome, nouriel roubini. %$* 13
and to all of our debaters. %$* 13
i want to ask you now to go to the keypads at your seats. %$* 13
we want to know where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
if you agree with our motion, "big government is stifling the american spirit," press number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, press number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
if you make a mistake on this, just correct your mistake and the system will lock in your last entry, and you can ignore the other numbers. %$* 13
everybody good. %$* 13
so in this debate you, our live audience, are the judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has concluded, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again at the end after all of the arguments have been made. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate shall be declared our winner. %$* 13
now, we need to take a quick break because we have a slight television problem, and some stage guys are going to come out and make an adjustment, and then we'll move on. %$* 13
our motion is "big government is stifling the american spirit." onto round one of this intelligence squared u.s. debate, opening statements by each side in turn. %$* 13
they are seven minutes each, and here to make the first argument for the motion, that "big government is stifling the american spirit," phil gramm, a former senator and chairman of the banking committee, currently vice chairman of ubs investment bank. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, phil gramm. %$* 13
john, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and bloomberg, thank you for hosting the debate on the issues. %$* 435
ideas have consequences, and debating ideas is always important for a free society. %$* 435
since the enlightenment it has generally been accepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key to unleashing human potential. %$* 435
freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things, and america is proof that freedom works. %$* 435
across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness. %$* 435
within our own country states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of law have tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migration where people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom. %$* 435
when economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes. %$* 435
and our argument tonight is pretty simple. %$* 435
our economic freedom is imperiled. %$* 435
just two years ago the national debt of our country was 40 percent of our annual production. %$* 435
two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the current budget that congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by america. %$* 435
interest payments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if every assumption of the obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes collected in america just to pay interest on the federal debt. %$* 435
if the obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxes collected in america in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt. %$* 435
if this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is? %$* 435
what could be? %$* 435
this is big government stifling the american spirit. %$* 435
but the crisis is so much greater than these frightening numbers would lead you to believe. %$* 435
if you listen to washington, this problem is easy to solve. %$* 435
all you’ve got to do is tax rich people. %$* 435
well rich people already pay more of the taxes than at any time in american history. %$* 435
and the problem is there are just not enough of them. %$* 435
our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entity in the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldn’t deal with our deficit, much less our debt. %$* 435
and it’s not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percent we have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes in peacetime in american history. %$* 435
you often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people. %$* 435
but the reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium size businesses have changed the way they’re taxed from corporate entities to being taxed as individuals. %$* 435
the finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all the income of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes from partnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter s. in short, from small businesses filing as individuals. %$* 435
the policy that we’re told will tax john q.astor in reality will tax joe brown and son hardware store, and here’s the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs. %$* 435
it is simply not feasible, given where we are in the economic cycle, to be raising taxes on small business. %$* 435
the solution to excess spending is not excess taxes; it’s less spending. %$* 435
if you’re in a hole and you can’t get out, the first thing you need to do is stop digging and stop digging now means stop spending. %$* 435
but if we can’t get our government to stop spending, how are we ever going to get them to reduce spending, to reform entitlements, to address social security, to address medicare, to address medicaid? %$* 435
well let me suggest that we not give up on america and that we not give up our own confidence in the system. %$* 435
it’s important to remember that we overcame 10 percent unemployment, double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, economic stagnation, malaise, self-doubt and the soviet union in the 1980s under ronald reagan. %$* 435
it seems like an eternity ago but remember, a republican congress worked with bill clinton to reform welfare and to balance the budget and to put america to work. %$* 435
we did it once. %$* 435
we can do it again. %$* 435
but we can’t do it with the same old programs and the same old politics as usual. %$* 435
thank you all very much. %$* 435
thank you, phil graham. %$* 13
our motion is “big government is stifling the american spirit,” and now to speak first against this motion, laura tyson, a professor at berkeley’s haas business school and a member of president obama’s economic recovery advisory board. %$* 13
thank you, and i’m honored to be part of this debate. %$* 436
and i should say that i was inspired to a world of debate by my son, who’s in the audience, who has devoted much of his college and high school career to debate. %$* 436
so i hope i do a good job as a debater. %$* 436
how big should the government be, is my question. %$* 436
and i think that depends. %$* 436
it depends upon the tasks and the challenges that government undertakes. %$* 436
it depends upon what its citizens want the government to do. %$* 436
the government in a democracy is us. %$* 436
we cannot blame the government. %$* 436
we have to look to ourselves. %$* 436
and one of the main points i want to make tonight is we don't do it. %$* 436
we refuse to do the arithmetic. %$* 436
we want the government to do a lot, and we don't want the government to pay for it. %$* 436
now, let me start with the government and the tasks right now, because part of the introduction here was, is the government stifling the american spirit right now? %$* 436
i suggest we be students of history here. %$* 436
the u.s.has just gone through one of the world's largest financial crises in economic history. %$* 436
we know a lot about financial crises across our own economy over time and around the world. %$* 436
and we know that they are the result of a failure, a collapse, a mess created by the private sector, created by overleveraged banks, created by people who take on debt they cannot finance, created by people who engage in sophisticated trading, buy a credit default swap, don't even know what a credit default swap is. %$* 436
think i'll buy one; it's an innovation. %$* 436
when you have a major financial crisis and the recession which follows, the government has to help clean up the mess. %$* 436
and we know this over time from the tulip crisis of several hundred years ago to today's financial crisis. %$* 436
and we know-- %$* 436
you know what we know? %$* 436
that when government's clean up the mess, that is stabilize the banking system, that is make sure demand deposits are there when you go to the bank, make sure your money market funds don't fall below a dollar, the government has to supply capital to the financial institutions to do that. %$* 436
the government has to also deal with the slowdown in the economy, the recession, the loss of job, the bankruptcies, the closures of plants. %$* 436
and that is what economic stimulus is meant to do. %$* 436
and does it work perfectly? %$* 436
no. %$* 436
does it work? %$* 436
yes. %$* 436
if you look at what government has done, and you look at the projections of any macro model in the u.s.economy, you will see that the stimulus was projected to produce about 3.5 million jobs. %$* 436
and that's exactly what it has done. %$* 436
so one thing i will say is that we are dealing right at a moment in time where we have a mess that has to be cleaned up. %$* 436
it's a little bit-- %$* 436
i think of it more broadly as governments have to clean up messes occasionally. %$* 436
for example, let's take katrina. %$* 436
let's take hurricane katrina. %$* 436
there was a failure to clean up a mess that was a government responsibility to clean up. %$* 436
and by the way, one of the reasons hurricane katrina caused so much damage, there was another government failure. %$* 436
the government didn't spend enough on the levees. %$* 436
the american civil engineering society warned, d minus, for u.s. infrastructure on the levees. %$* 436
we failed to spend. %$* 436
we invited a natural disaster. %$* 436
we failed to clean up the mess. %$* 436
second area where the government, i think, has a role to play. %$* 436
think about the innovative spirit of the united states. %$* 436
think about technology. %$* 436
think about higher education. %$* 436
think about nyu.think about the university of california. %$* 436
you will see that education, higher education, investments in technology, the things that build america's innovative spirit, these are big parts of what the federal government should and does do. %$* 436
you love social networking? %$* 436
trace it back to darpa. you love the latest biotech drug? %$* 436
trace it back to the national institute of health. %$* 436
you like traveling on jet aircraft? %$* 436
trace it back to the department of defense. %$* 436
there are many ways in which the u.s. government has spent over many years to build education infrastructure and technology which play into the spirit of america. %$* 436
they are part of the innovative spirit of america. %$* 436
now, there is a problem. %$* 436
a problem is that the government has, over time, been spending less on that as a share of total government spending. %$* 436
and it's been spending less on that as a share of our economy. %$* 436
our economy's gotten bigger. %$* 436
those kinds of government investments have become less important as a share of the economy. %$* 436
why? %$* 436
what's going on? %$* 436
well, one-- %$* 436
let's look for a minute at defense, because when we're thinking about the size of government, think about defense in the u.s. the u.s. has 4.3 percent of the world's population and spends 43 percent of global defense spending, 43 percent, almost half of the world's defense spending is spent right here in the u.s. we are defending the u.s. and we're not just defending the u.s. we are defending much of the rest of the world. %$* 436
we don't hear about that from the critics of the size of government. %$* 436
we need to talk about the government spending almost 20 percent of its total budget on defense, it spending much less on innovation, education, infrastructure, failing infrastructure. %$* 436
now, let me just get to a couple facts about the size of government comparatively speaking, because you might say, god, the u.s.government's so big. %$* 436
u.s.government as a share of gdp has really not changed very much in the last 20 years. %$* 436
actually, i heard the applause for ronald reagan, president reagan. %$* 436
government spending under his term actually rose to about almost 24.5 percent of gdp.it fell under president clinton and under president george w.bush. %$* 436
so, presidents do have different ways of handling this. %$* 436
but the point is the u.s. has been spending in the past 20 years about 20 percent. %$* 436
the government has not gotten bigger. %$* 436
and by the way, government spending as a share of gdp or government tax revenues as a share of gdp, if you look at the most competitive nations in the world, and you line up the u.s., you will see that the u.s.is one of the most competitive nations in the world. %$* 436
but-- %$* 436
there are many other nations that do as well as the u.s., but they do it with much higher levels of government spending and taxes as a share of their gdp.they're innovative, they have spirit. %$* 436
they're competitive. %$* 436
they're growing rapidly. %$* 436
their governments are a whole lot bigger. %$* 436
i see i'm running out of time, so let me say the final thing because i think this is very important to think about. %$* 436
i'll bring this up in my comments. %$* 436
i started with the view that the government is us. %$* 436
the biggest area of growth in the u.s.government is entitlement spending. %$* 436
entitlement spending is social security and medicare. %$* 436
you ask americans if they like it-- %$* 436
yes. %$* 436
i will say they like it. %$* 436
they don't want to pay for it. %$* 436
thank you. %$* 436
laura, time is up. %$* 13
you ask americans if they like it-- %$* 436
i have to cut you off. %$* 13
yes. %$* 436
i will say they like it. %$* 436
they don't want to pay for it. %$* 436
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 436
thank you. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: big government is stifling the american spirit. %$* 13
you have heard two of the opening statements. %$* 13
now onto the third. %$* 13
for the motion, “big government is stifling the american spirit,” arthur laffer who is known as the father of supply side economics. %$* 13
he is chairman of laffer associates and a former economic advisor to president reagan. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, arthur laffer. %$* 13
the first thing i have to do is lower this microphone a little bit. %$* 15
you're pretty tall, phil, but-- %$* 15
and in the other sense, i'll keep my comments short, if you know what i mean. %$* 15
now, you told me i had to start off with a little light something or other. %$* 15
and i was talking to my granddaughter, maggie rembert, about saying something light, and i didn't really know what to say. %$* 15
and she said, "papa, you can always tell them about the invisible man who married the invisible woman. %$* 15
the kids weren't much to look at either." let me, if i can-- %$* 15
i'm going to stick with-- %$* 15
sorry. %$* 15
let me just start with-- %$* 15
i'm going to let phil's facts speak for themselves. %$* 15
and i agree with them whole-heartedly on the road to prosperity. %$* 15
i want to just say-- %$* 15
and again i want to agree with laura that it's not partisan. %$* 15
it's not republican. %$* 15
it's not democrat. %$* 15
it's not liberal. %$* 15
it's not conservative. %$* 15
it's not left wing, it's not right wing. %$* 15
it's economics. %$* 15
and that's where we really are. %$* 15
and it's really not partisan ideology. %$* 15
it's plain business. %$* 15
and if you look at today's economy - - and i do want to look at today's economy-- %$* 15
when you look at what the government has done and is doing, i think they truly are stifling the american spirit today. %$* 15
it reminds me very much of what happened in the 1930s when you got that, whenever people make decisions-- %$* 15
whenever people make decisions when they're either panicked or drunk the consequences are rarely attractive. %$* 15
we have had a panic decision here in the united states, and i believe it was wrong. %$* 15
i believe the government intervened dramatically when they should not have. %$* 15
they should have had a brown paper bag and gotten the feelings out of them. %$* 15
they should not have moved. %$* 15
but they did. %$* 15
we had tarp.we had the interventions there, the stimulus packages. %$* 15
they don't work. %$* 15
now, what laura is correct about is that they sure worked for the beneficiaries of the stimulus programs. %$* 15
that's true. %$* 15
the transfer recipients were stimulated, and they did spend more. %$* 15
no question about it. %$* 15
but the people from whom the resources were taken, they spent less. %$* 15
and as we all know in economics, and if you go to the slutsky equations in an economy, the income effects always sum to zero, bingo. %$* 15
while the transfer recipients are stimulated, the transfer payers are de-stimulated, and there is no net stimulus from these packages purely. %$* 15
now, the substitution effects aggregate. %$* 15
and what has happened is we've led the huge deficits, huge tax rates, and output employment production. %$* 15
i mean, let me just take you through quickly what they did in the great depression. %$* 15
i mean, 1929, we passed smoot-hawley tariff, the largest tax on traded products in the world. %$* 15
then in 1930 it was signed into law, you got the crash in the markets. %$* 15
1932, under a republican president, they raised the highest marginal tax rate in the u.s., from 25 percent to 63 percent. %$* 15
now, wasn't that smart? %$* 15
by the way, i'm not mentioning any of the others, inheritance tax, the gift taxes, you know, all these other taxes, excise, et cetera. %$* 15
1936, under franklin delano roosevelt, a democrat this time, they raised the highest marginal tax rate from 63 percent to 79 percent and then on up the next year to 81 percent. %$* 15
you wonder why it was the longest deepest depression in u.s.history, that's why. %$* 15
i mean, they raised the estate tax up to 90 percent. %$* 15
i mean, it's amazing what happened there. %$* 15
what you're seeing today in the united states is an exact pattern following that. %$* 15
when interventionist people get going, you can't stop it, and that is precisely what's happening in the u.s.in part it's because of the agency problem, and the agency problem is very simply that the people in government don't bear the consequences of their own actions. %$* 15
they are not compensated for their success or their failures. %$* 15
they're compensated. %$* 15
it's very different than what happens in the private sector. %$* 15
and that's why you get a misbehavior there. %$* 15
just on the stimulus, let me just try it, if something doesn't work in a two-person economy, it's not good economics. %$* 15
take two farmers, that's the whole world. %$* 15
if one of those farmers gets unemployment benefits, guess who pays for it? %$* 15
the other farmer. %$* 15
you know, it is-- %$* 15
there is no tooth fairy in government. %$* 15
there is no-- %$* 15
you know, there is no father christmas working on the treasury staff. %$* 15
my colleague, milton friedman, was correct when he said, "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch." if you look at tax rates on the upper income groups, anyone who looks at these data from the statistics of income, these people know how to get around taxes. %$* 15
if you raise their tax rates, they shift their income, they shift the location of their income, they shift the timing of their income, they shift the volume of their income, and they pay less in taxes. %$* 15
the only group that consistently pays less when you raise their tax rates and more when you lower them are the top one percent of income earners. %$* 15
that is literally what happens. %$* 15
again, just to finish my comments, and i'm going to finish my comments early if i can, john, but i don't want to go way over your head on this, but if you tax people who work and you pay people who don't, do i need to say the next sentence to you? %$* 15
help me, if you tax rich people, and you give the money to poor people, you're going to get lots and lots of poor people and no rich people. %$* 15
the dream in america has always been to make the poor rich, not to make the rich-- %$* 15
the rich poor. %$* 15
i mean, if i can quote john f. kennedy here, and i'm a kennedy democrat from the '60s, i've worked with democrats as much or more-- %$* 15
i mean, i started with phil gramm, can you believe that? %$* 15
when he was a democrat. %$* 15
but, you know, kennedy put it beautifully when he said, "the best form of welfare is still a good high paying job." i mean, benjamin hooks i thought did it wonderfully when he said that “blacks are hired last, and they're fired first. %$* 15
the only way we're ever going to get jobs and keep them is there's so darn many jobs around they got to hire us." i want to tell you very seriously, there is only one solution to the economic problem that we're facing, that's economic growth, and to get that economic growth you've got to realign incentives both in government and in the private sector to make sure that you produce the way you should in this country. %$* 15
and with that i'd like to say thank you to the groups that are putting on this debate. %$* 15
you guys are all wonderful. %$* 15
thank you. %$* 15
our motion is "big government is stifling the america spirit," and finally our last opening statement against the motion comes from nouriel roubini, a professor at new york university's stern school of business, and chairman of roubini global economics, nicknamed "dr. %$* 13
doom." %$* 13
good evening, everyone. %$* 163
it's great being here on this nyu stage. %$* 163
i'm a professor at nyu, so great being here at home. %$* 163
is big government stifling the american spirit? %$* 163
my answer is no. %$* 163
you heard the gramm and laffer bashing the government. %$* 163
they’re the two high priests of supply-side economics, what is also referred to as voodoo economics. %$* 163
actually the term voodoo economics was first used by george bush when he was campaigning against reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign. %$* 163
it’s a religion because it’s based not on facts or science but on faith. %$* 163
they have ten commandments. %$* 163
big government and most government spending are always wasteful and stifles the american spirit, first. %$* 163
second, free markets always know best, they never fail, they never experience a national crisis. %$* 163
three, it’s best to have no regulation or supervision of markets, especially financial markets. %$* 163
four, high taxes are bad especially for the rich and the very rich. %$* 163
five, lowering tax rates increases revenues overall, the laffer curve doesn’t work. %$* 163
even if lower taxes lead to higher deficits, higher deficits don’t matter. %$* 163
seven, even if lower tax rates cause higher deficits, that’s good because you’ve got to starve the beast, you’ve got to force the government to cut back its own size. %$* 163
that doesn’t work either. %$* 163
eight, government spending is always wasteful unless it’s for foreign wars that cost trillions of dollars. %$* 163
nine, subsidies are bad but subsidies and tax breaks for big business are always good even if they bust the budget. %$* 163
ten, income and wealth inequality are good; as gordon gekko said, greed is good. %$* 163
in capitalism it is the survival of the fittest or the richest. %$* 163
big government should have nothing to do with income inequality. %$* 163
now these are the principles, but with a bunch of experiments in the ’80s and the last ten years which means 2001 to 2008 during the bush administration-- %$* 163
we had the system of free markets and laissez-faire economics, no regulation, supervision of the financial system, lower tax rates and supply-side voodoo economics and a rhetoric of bashing big government while increasingly spending on government spending, discretionary spending and on the military. %$* 163
what did we end up with? %$* 163
we ended up with the worst financial and economic crisis since the great depression, two expensive foreign wars financed with two trillion dollars worth of debt, with budget deficits that were already over a trillion dollars when obama became president. %$* 163
so who bailed out bear stearns, fannie and freddie, aig, citi, goldman-sachs, an entire financial system with 700 billion tarp money? %$* 163
was it the democrats? %$* 163
no, it was during the bush administration. %$* 163
so who are the culprits of this economic, fiscal, and financial mess? %$* 163
is it big government? %$* 163
no. %$* 163
the culprits are here, by the way, two of them are here, mr. %$* 163
laffer, mr. %$* 163
gramm. %$* 163
and i mean it literally. %$* 163
paul krugman listed mr. %$* 163
gramm as the number two person responsible for the economic crisis after alan greenspan. %$* 163
if you believe that krugman is biased, both cnn and time magazine put them in the list of the top 20 people to blame for the financial crisis. %$* 163
what his record is is he has been bashing big government forever, for decades, but he was a leading author by the gramm-leach-bliley act that essentially repealed the glass- steagall act, that led to what is called the citigroup relief act, that led to the merger, the disastrous merger, of citicorp and the travelers group. %$* 163
now they’re under government control, these financial institutions. %$* 163
and as we know, the repeal of the glass-steagall act was one of the many causes of the recent financial crisis. %$* 163
gramm was also one of the five co-sponsors of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 that essentially limited any regulation of credit derivatives and other derivatives, with even an enron loop hole in it that essentially limited any regulation of energy futures. %$* 163
you know what ended up happening with enron. %$* 163
it went to a scandal and bankruptcy. %$* 163
other parts of this act limited regulation and supervision of credit derivatives, of cdss and other derivatives as well at the center of this financial crisis. %$* 163
warren buffet calls these derivatives weapons of mass destruction. %$* 163
so that’s the record. %$* 163
does he think he’s responsible for some of the financial crisis? %$* 163
not only doesn’t he, but in a july 2008 interview, when he was advisor to mccain, he said that the nation was not even in a recession. %$* 163
he said, you’ve heard of mental depression. %$* 163
this is a mental recession. %$* 163
we’ve sort of become a nation of whiners. %$* 163
you just hear the constant whining, complaining about the loss of competitiveness, american decline. %$* 163
during this mental recession, 8.5 million people lost their jobs, unemployment went to 10 percent, 17 percent including discouraged workers or partially-employed workers. %$* 163
and of course mr. %$* 163
gramm and mr. %$* 163
laffer believe that giving unemployment benefits because of loss of jobs and income is bad because it reduces the incentive to find new work. %$* 163
now what’s the record instead of mr. %$* 163
laffer? %$* 163
he is the father of the laffer curve, the idea that if you lower tax rates, revenue is eventually going to be become higher. %$* 163
now, there is zero, zero evidence that tax rates pay for themselves. %$* 163
i could cite hundreds of economic studies, but i will cite just one person, greg mankiw, who was the main economic advisor of george bush, w. %$* 163
he is also a professor at harvard. %$* 163
he said the following thing about the idea of a laffer curve working, in a part of his textbook called charlatans and cranks. %$* 163
“when politicians rely on the advice of charlatans and cranks, they rarely get the desirable results they anticipate. %$* 163
after reagan's election, congress passed the cut in tax rates that reagan advocated. %$* 163
but the tax cut did not cause tax revenue to rise.” and i could cite hundreds of other studies suggesting that there is absolutely no evidence that reducing tax rates increases revenues. %$* 163
david stockman, who was the budget director for reagan, most recently in an op-ed in the new york times titled “how my republican party destroyed the american economy.” and he started his op-ed by saying, “if there was such a thing as a chapter 11 for politicians, the republican push to extend unaffordable bush tax cuts would amount to bankruptcy filing. %$* 163
that's the lesson.” now, we realize that tax cuts do not reduce budget deficits. %$* 163
they increase them sharply. %$* 163
so they change the argument in favor of tax cuts. %$* 163
they realize that tax cuts are to budget deficit. %$* 163
but they say, first of all, it doesn't matter. %$* 163
or if does matter, it's going to starve the beast. %$* 163
to have low tax rates is going to force the government to cut government spending. %$* 163
that was the argument. %$* 163
the result was just the opposite. %$* 163
when bush came to power in 2001, discretionary spending was 260 billion at that time. %$* 163
by the time he left the administration eight years later, it was 420 billion, twice as much. %$* 163
okay. %$* 163
could i make a final point? %$* 163
nouriel roubini, your time is up. %$* 13
okay. %$* 163
thank you. %$* 13
could i make a final point? %$* 163
i think-- %$* 13
can you save it? %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared debate, where the motion being argued is “big government is stifling the american spirit.” we'll be right back. %$* 13
and now we are back. %$* 13
by the way, your instincts on when to applaud have been fantastic, so thank you. %$* 13
in terms of the atmospherics for the radio broadcast, so thank you for that. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
i know what you want to do. %$* 13
and i would rather that this happen in the middle. %$* 13
see what you've started here. %$* 13
i realize that you were just the subject of a personal attack. %$* 13
no. %$* 18
the first time. %$* 18
the first time. %$* 18
when you can't debate issues, you attack people personally. %$* 435
and what i would like to do because of that is to ask you to take just one minute, and then we can move on to the substance of the issue. %$* 13
okay. %$* 435
let's-- %$* 435
and leave it at that. %$* 13
so the minute starts now. %$* 13
first of all, my confidence in freedom is not based on faith. %$* 435
it's based on evidence. %$* 435
two, it's true that bill clinton spent the whole campaign attacking me and attacking gramm-leach-bliley. %$* 435
but when he became president, and he proposed reforming the banking system, how many changes do you think he made in gramm- leach-bliley? %$* 435
none. %$* 435
in fact, he strengthened gramm-leach-bliley to require systemically significant companies to become financial services holding companies under gramm-leach-bliley. %$* 435
so the plain truth is gramm-leach-bliley broad based organizations did better during the financial crisis. %$* 435
there would have been more failures without the law. %$* 435
obama had a chance to change the law, and he didn't do it. %$* 435
now, some people would say, well, maybe he wasn't telling the truth to begin with. %$* 435
i don't think that. %$* 435
i think he just learned something. %$* 435
not everybody did. %$* 435
thank you, phil gramm. %$* 13
and you're straying into your real time now, so i'm going to move on to round two. %$* 13
big government is stifling the american spirit, that is our motion. %$* 13
and now we move on to round two where the debaters address each other directly. %$* 13
the side for the motion, phil gramm who fought to shrink government when he was in the senate, and art laffer, the man behind the curve, arguing that government ties the hands of the truly creative and innovative, those who would otherwise help grow america and create jobs. %$* 13
the side against the motion “big government is stifling the american spirit,” laura tyson and nouriel roubini, insisting that governments and laws are needed both to rescue those who are in trouble and to police those who, left to their own devices, particularly in the world of business, would do much more harm than good and have in the very recent past. %$* 13
we're now going to move to that part of the debate where i ask questions, you ask questions, and the debaters can talk with one another directly. %$* 13
and i want to go to the issue of substance. %$* 13
to the side that's arguing against the motion, your opponents are proposing a thesis that when the rich are taxed, they stop producing growth. %$* 13
can you go specifically to that issue, to that thesis which is really the core of their argument, laura tyson. %$* 13
well, i'm not sure i would agree it is the core of their argument, because i want to say that i think the issue that we need to discuss more is that as a country, we actually, as i said, want the government to spend money. %$* 436
but then we don't want to pay for it. %$* 436
and one of the words that was only used here once tonight, but needs to be brought back, is the word entitlement. %$* 436
and i think it's important to point out right now that according to the cbo, within 15 years entitlements plus net interest will absorb all of the tax revenues of the us government. %$* 436
we could not do anything else, no education, no technology, no infrastructure, no other government whatsoever. %$* 436
so i think that as we debate what kind of tax system we're going to have, and i think that's a legitimate area of debate, we also have to address the fact that 78 percent of americans will say growing costs of entitlements pose a major problem for the united states. %$* 436
but if you ask them what to do about it, 56 percent say no tax increases to solve the problem. %$* 436
66 percent say no benefit cuts to solve the problem. %$* 436
a third of the people say no change whatsoever to solve the problem, a big problem, but not my problem. %$* 436
and i do think we have to ask ourselves the question of if we want to spend on programs, how are we going to finance them? %$* 436
but how about the question i asked here? %$* 13
but i think-- %$* 436
i'm happy to answer that question-- %$* 436
but i honestly think it's-- %$* 436
your teammate would like to know %$* 13
yes, go ahead. %$* 436
there is absolutely no evidence that increasing tax rates when they're at normal levels is going to reduce labor efforts. %$* 163
when clinton came to power, he raised the marginal tax rate from 35 to 39 percent. %$* 163
everybody, including these gentlemen, said it's going to be a disaster, a recession. %$* 163
guess what? %$* 163
we had eight years of the highest economic growth in the u.s.economy, and no effect on the tax burden of anybody. %$* 163
and then-- %$* 163
and then, when bush came to power, he reduced these taxes. %$* 163
we lost $2 trillion of revenues. %$* 163
we had a huge budget deficit. %$* 163
we eventually ended up with the worst financial crisis and economic recession since the great depression. %$* 163
so where is the evidence? %$* 163
arthur laffer. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 15
i'll try to get to the evidence. %$* 15
let's take bill clinton. %$* 15
and laura, i think you did a great job with bill clinton. %$* 15
and i voted for bill clinton twice, and god knows i didn't vote in that party's primary. %$* 15
so i voted for him twice, and i thought he was a great president. %$* 15
little bit of a problem as a person. %$* 15
but he was a great president. %$* 15
but he pushed nafta through congress against his own party, against the unions. %$* 15
i thought that was just wonderful. %$* 15
i took my hat off to him there. %$* 15

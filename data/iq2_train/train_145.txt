so i'm hoping my voice will hold out. %$* 13
if not, there are four great debaters who are going to do that for us. %$* 13
but before we get to that i want to bring to the stage person who brought intelligence squared u.s. to the united states, robert rosenkranz, who will help frame the debate for us tonight. %$* 13
pardon? %$* 1
i'm going to make it. %$* 13
good. %$* 1
bob, this is a debate where we could have put in the motion, "the world can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
the u.s.can live with a nuclear iran." we made it israel. %$* 13
why israel? %$* 13
we made it israel because for the united states a nuclear iran is a strategic setback, but for israel it's an actual existential threat. %$* 1
and because the stakes are so high for israel, we felt the debate should focus on its decisions. %$* 1
and the team that's arguing for the motion that israel can live with a nuclear iran, what's the best argument they have going for them? %$* 13
well, i'd say the best argument is that first of all israel can certainly deter any kind of iranian nuclear attack on its own soil. %$* 1
it's got vastly greater military capabilities than iran does. %$* 1
it can defend itself better. %$* 1
and it can unleash absolute devastation on iran. %$* 1
iran has had disturbing rhetoric, but they've never actually done anything that's irrational or self-destructive, so that they can be deterred just like any other country from using those kinds of weapons. %$* 1
the other argument against is that the ultimate way in which israel would be able to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons is not just cyber attacks or these clandestine operations we've been reading about, but an actual attack, a bombing of their facilities, which would very likely result in a war in the middle east, and that war could leave israel isolated, it could entrench the ayatollahs, it could actually over the long run result in a diminution of israel's security. %$* 1
so you actually made the argument for the other side as well. %$* 13
well, i mean, that's the argument in a sense why israel can tolerate it because the costs of not tolerating it are too high. %$* 1
the counterargument would be that it doesn't matter whether iran uses nuclear weapons or not, the mere possession of them changes the game. %$* 1
iran is a revolutionary power, and if it has the protection of nuclear weapons there's no telling what kind of provocations we're going to get out of them. %$* 1
they certainly would be unconstrained in providing more advanced missiles to hezbollah. %$* 1
they could be more unconstrained in supporting assad in syria. %$* 1
god knows what influence they might try to exercise in iran. %$* 1
and it's not just about iranian nukes. %$* 1
if iran gets nuclear weapons, egypt is not going to be far behind, and turkey, and saudi arabia, and the last thing we need in terms of global security is a multi-nuclear middle east. %$* 1
so the stakes in tonight's debate are very, very high. %$* 1
well, i know you've met our debaters backstage, and they're great, so let's bring them out. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters this evening. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and i just want to invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
it's the nuclear secret that never was, that israel has the only nuclear arsenal in the middle east; its leaders have never confirmed it nor never denied it, but one thing they cop to without hesitation is their total rejection of iran ever getting the bomb. %$* 13
they talk about going to war to stop that from happening, because they say that israel cannot without live a nuclear iran. %$* 13
or can it? %$* 13
that's what we're here to debate, so let's do it. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters to argue for and against this motion: israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
our debate, as always, will go in three rounds and then, you, the live audience, votes to choose a winner and only one side wins. %$* 13
israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
on the side arguing for the motion, james dobbins. %$* 13
he is the director of international security and defense policy center at rand.his partner is reuven pedatzur, a senior military affairs analyst with haaretz. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion israel can live with a nuclear iran, shmuel bar. %$* 13
he is director of studies at the institute of policy and strategy in herzliya, israel; and his partner, jeffrey goldberg, who is national correspondent for the atlantic and columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
our motion is israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and now let's meet the team arguing for the emotion. %$* 13
first, let's welcome, again, james dobbins. %$* 13
and james, you are now at rand, where you are director of the international security and defense policy center, but in a previous life, working with the state department, you were at the talks for the conference for the setting up of the state of afghanistan in the wake of 9/11. and, in that, you were involved in negotiations that involved the iranians and you said that the iranian delegation was helpful in the process and you know that that's not really the reputation that the iranians normally bring to the table. %$* 13
well, they were helpful. %$* 425
i think it was just sort of a combination of gratitude and fear. %$* 425
they were grateful that we just knocked off one of their two principal regional rivals, which was the taliban, and they were fearful that they might be next. %$* 425
and so it was a combination. %$* 425
it was also a different iranian government than the one we have today; it was a reformist regime operating within an environment that limited their powers but not limited to the point they couldn't reach out. %$* 425
it was a genuine opportunity that we flubbed. %$* 425
i'm not going to argue tonight that we still have that opportunity. %$* 425
james dobbins. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
your partner is reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
excuse me, i thought i was finished. %$* 425
yes, reuven pedatzur. %$* 425
okay. %$* 13
reuven pedatzur, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
reuven, you are also arguing for the motion that israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
you have obviously a serious personal stake in this, you are a resident of the state of israel, you were a fighter pilot-- %$* 13
you were a pilot in the israeli air force. %$* 13
you now write for the haaretz newspaper on issues of security and military affairs. %$* 13
reuven, you told us back in 2006, seven years ago, where you stood on this issue, when you wrote a piece back then that said "let them have nukes," them being iran. %$* 13
what sort of reaction did you get back then? %$* 13
there was no reaction whatsoever, because you should know that in israel there are no public debates on nuclear issues; it's taboo, so there was no reaction. %$* 426
and if that happened today? %$* 13
the same. %$* 426
yeah, well, we're going to have a debate tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
our motion is israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and two debaters arguing against it: first, shmuel bar, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
shmuel, like your opponent, you have that stake of being an israeli citizen; you also served in war as an intelligence officer. %$* 13
you now direct studies at the institute of policy and strategy in herzliya, israel. %$* 13
just a short preview of your argument here. %$* 13
it's sometimes argued that the iranians would be no more interested in nuclear war than the soviets were during the cold war, and they didn't use it. %$* 13
so give us one reason that that argument just doesnâ€™t end this debate right now. %$* 13
well, since i'm a historian, i've noticed that if during history everybody had acted according to the rational actor model, then most of what we know as history wouldn't have happened. %$* 427
pearl harbor wouldn't have happened. %$* 427
barbarossa wouldn't have happened. %$* 427
certainly stalingrad wouldn't have happened. %$* 427
so apparently things happen which are not necessarily because it's in the interest of somebody to let it happen but because of other dynamics. %$* 427
shmuel bar, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and your partner is? %$* 13
jeff goldberg. %$* 427
i know how to pronounce it. %$* 427
ladies and gentlemen, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
jeffrey, you're also arguing against the motion that israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
you're a national correspondent for the atlantic, a columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
you're in a unique position in that you've had more exclusive interviews with bibi netanyahu, i think, than any other american journalist over the past several years. %$* 13
you've been inside the guy's head, or you've been near the head. %$* 13
where do you think he is in terms of his thinking seriously about his willingness to go to war over this? %$* 13
is it a posture, or is it a decision? %$* 13
well, i would say, first, that, you know, there are teams of neuroscientists in a bunker under the white house trying to figure out what's in netanyahu's head. %$* 428
so it's a mystery to me too. %$* 428
i would say, to sum him up in a sentence, i would say that he has many manifestations of a typical, insincere politician. %$* 428
on the iran question, i think he's actually sincere. %$* 428
what that means for policy, i don't know. %$* 428
but he is very sincerely gripped by this issue. %$* 428
and he's not liking you very much these days. %$* 13
we're having difficulties in our relationship, yes, at the moment. %$* 428
at the moment. %$* 428
thank you, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our four debaters. %$* 13
you know israel eye would like to know what's in netanyahu's head. %$* 426
check with the guys in the basement of the white house. %$* 13
so as we said before, in this debate, our live audience, act as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate is over, we will have asked you two times to vote, the first time telling us where you stand on this motion before hearing the debate, the motion being: israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
then we'll have you vote a second time after the debate is over, where you stand on the point after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
and the team who has moved its numbers the most over the course of the evening will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's register your preliminary vote. %$* 13
our motion is: israel, live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
if you side with this motion at this point, push number one on your keypad. %$* 13
if you're against it, push number two. %$* 13
and if you're undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you think that you made a mistake, just correct it. %$* 13
the system will lock in the last vote that you did. %$* 13
and all of the other numbers are inactive, so just deal with 1, 2 or 3.and it looks like everybody is done. %$* 13
so remember, again, we're going to reveal the result of that vote after you've heard all the arguments and after you have voted the second time. %$* 13
that will come at the end of the debate in its final minutes. %$* 13
and that is how you, our audience, will choose the winner. %$* 13
so we go in three rounds. %$* 13
and first on to round one, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and here to speak first for the motion, reuven pedatzur, arguing that israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
he is a senior military affairs analyst with the haaretz newspaper and a senior lecturer in political science at tel aviv university. %$* 13
he's a former pilot for the israeli air force and services as director of the s.daniel abraham center for strategic dialogue at natania academic center. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 426
where are the results? %$* 426
no results yet? %$* 426
anyway, can israel live with a nuclear iran? %$* 426
the short answer is yes. %$* 426
any questions? %$* 426
okay. %$* 426
but the real question is not this one. %$* 426
the real question, do we have another choice? %$* 426
and unfortunately, the answer is no. %$* 426
because it's possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an israeli military attack that in this decade, iran will have nuclear weapons. %$* 426
so the question is for the israeli policymakers, what then? %$* 426
what will be our policy in this case when iran will have the weapons? %$* 426
unfortunately there is-- %$* 426
as i said, there are no public debates on this, so we don't know what they think over there about future policy. %$* 426
what should israel do when there will be a hostile iran with nuclear weapons? %$* 426
the most effective and maybe the only way to deter iran is to abandon our ambiguity, nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence. %$* 426
and since, in israel, we have censorship, as you know, i have to play the game. %$* 426
and when i refer to israeli nuclear deterrence, israeli nuclear weapons, israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources. %$* 426
i don't know anything. %$* 426
and i have to use this phrase, "according to foreign sources."but israel has to change its policy and to move, as i say, to nuclear deterrence-- %$* 426
with new rules of the game. %$* 426
and the other side should know what are the rules of the game. %$* 426
there will be red lines so the iranians will understand it. %$* 426
for example, if israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in iran going westerly, for israel, it will be the nuclear missiles. %$* 426
and in this case, israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or not. %$* 426
automatically israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources, and it, tehran-- %$* 426
it's fine and so on and so on. %$* 426
and it should be clear for the other side what will happen. %$* 426
and then the ayatollahs in tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen. %$* 426
what will happen, that iran will be destroyed, and we'll go back to the middle ages. %$* 426
and i don't see any iranian national interests that justifies this cost. %$* 426
so i believe that we can deter them. %$* 426
i believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality. %$* 426
we cannot deter these extremist muslim ayatollahs. %$* 426
and if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then netanyahu is right, and we have to attack. %$* 426
but i don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent. %$* 426
for this, we'll have to change not just the policy. %$* 426
we have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the iranians what we have. %$* 426
and again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles. %$* 426
so we have second-strike capability, probably. %$* 426
so when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the cold war and say the ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers. %$* 426
they are not rational. %$* 426
they are not going to act like the soviet leaders or the american leaders, which is wrong, i believe, because if you can remember, during the cold war, stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman-- %$* 426
whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb. %$* 426
and the ayatollahs are not like this. %$* 426
and it seems from professional and sober analysis that the iranians will-- %$* 426
if we'll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders. %$* 426
we should understand that the development of the iranian nuclear weapons is not against israel. %$* 426
it's based on their experience during the war, the iran-iraq war in the '80s, not against israel. %$* 426
and it's very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program. %$* 426
and ironically, possession of nuclear weapons may moderate the iranian leadership, exactly what happened with the chinese leadership in '64 when they got their nuclear weapons, and they started acting like rational state. %$* 426
and another example is india and pakistan. %$* 426
only 23 seconds more. %$* 426
really? %$* 426
so india and pakistan, there were three wars, after they acquired their nuclear weapons in '98, about after a year there was the kargil crisis, and they acted very rationally in order not to deteriorate the situation in using the nuclear war. %$* 426
thank you. %$* 426
well, now 19. %$* 13
really? %$* 426
well, now it's 15. %$* 13
so india and pakistan, there were three wars, after they acquired their nuclear weapons in '98, about after a year there was the kargil crisis, and they acted very rationally in order not to deteriorate the situation in using the nuclear war. %$* 426
reuven pedatzur, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 426
our motion is that "israel can live with a nuclear iran," and here to speak against this motion, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
he is a national correspondent for the atlantic and a columnist for bloomberg view. %$* 13
before joining the atlantic, goldberg was a middle eastern-- %$* 13
a middle east correspondent and the washington correspondent for the new yorker. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 428
thank you. %$* 428
thank you, john. %$* 428
thank you to intelligence squared. %$* 428
thank you for coming. %$* 428
thank you, reuven. %$* 428
i-- %$* 428
as someone who's covered pakistan extensively, i'm not going to sit here and make believe that i would hold up pakistan as a model of stability-- %$* 428
and rational nuclear deterrence, but we can talk about that later. %$* 428
since you brought up this subject of the nature of the iranian regime and what they believe and what they think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute. %$* 428
what do we have in-- %$* 428
right now in the world? %$* 428
it's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in the post-world war ii international order. %$* 428
we have a member state of the united nations, the islamic republic of iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another member state of the united nations. %$* 428
that is israel. %$* 428
and they're very, very clear and consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the islamic republic. %$* 428
i'll give you a couple of examples. %$* 428
this is from the supreme leader of iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader-- %$* 428
he's the guy who sets the policy. %$* 428
quote, this is from last february, "the zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cut off." its feelings are echoed regularly among the iranian, and military, and intelligence elite. %$* 428
i'll give you another example. %$* 428
general gholam reza jalali, the former commander of the revolutionary guard corps, said last august, i quote, "the fact is, is that there is no other way but to stand firm and resist until israel is destroyed." general hassan firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the iranian armed forces, said last may, and i quote, "the iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of israel." finally, mohammad hassan rahimian who is a top aide to khamenei, said in the january 2010 television interview, quote, "we have manufactured missiles that allow us when necessary to replace israel in its entirety with a big holocaust." mr. %$* 428
rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part-- %$* 428
of the iranian regime. %$* 428
iranian opposition to israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the jewish state, the iranian regime works to destroy individual jews. %$* 428
hezbollah, the lebanese terror group, is a proxy of the iranian revolutionary guard corps. %$* 428
the rocket that it fires periodically into israel are iranian manufacture. %$* 428
the rockets that hamas fires from gaza very recently are iranian rockets. %$* 428
let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples around the world of iranians trying to kill israelis, in bulgaria, in azerbaijan, in georgia, in thailand. %$* 428
and let's not forget a fact i find very amazing, which is that the current defense minister of iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities for direct complicity in the bombing of a jewish community center in argentina. %$* 428
so you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the jewish state. %$* 428
you're dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual jews, which begs the question, "what would be the impact on middle east stability and on the safety of israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the annihilation of the jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring about that annihilation? %$* 428
" and that's the question that we're dealing with today. %$* 428
now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, i think. %$* 428
the first is to-- %$* 428
is to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the iranian regime is the foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a new holocaust. %$* 428
and it executes people for being gay and it threatens christian pastors with execution unless they convert to islam. %$* 428
and it's responsible for a quarter of the american combat deaths in iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-qaeda within its borders. %$* 428
but, on the other hand, no one's perfect-- %$* 428
and i'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, christian-persecuting, american- killing, jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible, rational, and enlightened way. %$* 428
the second response is what i call the, for lack of a better term, the "uncle morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle morty sitting in boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that barack obama is osama bin laden's third cousin by marriage. %$* 428
and the uncle morty response-- %$* 428
the uncle morty response is to say "you know, it's 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next tuesday and we're all done, and we're finished." the third response-- %$* 428
and this is what i want to get into during the course of this debate. %$* 428
the third response acknowledges a couple things. %$* 428
is that it isn't 1938.the jewish people do not stand defenseless and naked before the world. %$* 428
iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that single bomb at israel, but it's also clear that israel in a post-nuclear iran middle east is going to have a very, very hard time surviving. %$* 428
three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, shmuel, in a few minutes is going to talk about why the cold war models of mutual deterrence don't really apply in this situation. %$* 428
i'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be difficult for israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation. %$* 428
the first is very clear to everyone, including president obama. %$* 428
the day after there's going to be-- %$* 428
the day after iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the middle east. %$* 428
president obama has warned about this. %$* 428
he said very explicitly that a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing. %$* 428
so you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at each other. %$* 428
that's not a recipe for stability or happiness; it's certainly not a recipe for stability for the jewish state. %$* 428
second reason: if you believe that israel can only survive if it makes peace with its neighbors, then you will be opposed to the idea of iran getting a nuclear bomb. %$* 428
israel cannot survive in a middle east in which america is a defeated and weakened ally. %$* 428
america is israel's most important ally. %$* 428
if iran trumps america, if iran beats america by getting a nuclear weapon, it means that the arab states that were predisposed to make peace with israel-- %$* 428
and we know the peace process is anyway, they will align with iran, because iran is the winner of that conflict. %$* 428
the third and most obvious point is hamas and hezbollah, even now, periodically fire large numbers of rockets at israeli civilians. %$* 428
imagine the power that they will have when they can fire those rockets under the protection of the iranian nuclear umbrella. %$* 428
again, there is a real chance that an iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the middle east. %$* 428
even without that conflagration, it becomes very, very hard to envision how israel survives in the long term. %$* 428
thank you very much. %$* 428
thank you, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, who are arguing it out over this motion: israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
you're heard two of the opening statements. %$* 13
and now, on to the third. %$* 13
debating in support of the argument, james dobbins; he is a former u.s.assistant secretary of state and special envoy under the clinton and george w.bush administrations. %$* 13
he is now director of the international security and defense policy center at the rand corporation. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, james dobbins. %$* 13
well, just to remind us what we're debating about. %$* 425
the proposition is, can israel live with a nuclear iran, can israel survive a nuclear iran. %$* 425
the answer to that question is yes. %$* 425
you don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive. %$* 425
in fact, technically, you don't even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive. %$* 425
and i think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive. %$* 425
and jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder. %$* 425
but-- %$* 425
so i mean, i think if you debate at that level, it's pretty clear. %$* 425
there's almost nobody who thinks that israel's demise will be automatic and certain. %$* 425
it's a question of risk. %$* 425
and so i think in a sense, the real debate is, should israel live with a nuclear iran. %$* 425
and the answer is, not if they can help it, obviously. %$* 425
nobody thinks a nuclear iran is a good idea. %$* 425
and we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it. %$* 425
we have a massive probably unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort and cyber attacks. %$* 425
now, these may work in some combination. %$* 425
but i'd have to acknowledge that they may not. %$* 425
and so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent israel-- %$* 425
prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. %$* 425
and i think although that's not precisely what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that. %$* 425
now, the threshold for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon really has to go-- %$* 425
there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended consequences. %$* 425
you need to look at both. %$* 425
in terms of efficacy, i think most experts believe that an israeli attack on iran would set the program back by perhaps two years. %$* 425
that an american attack would be more effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years. %$* 425
it wouldn't prevent it, but it would slow it down. %$* 425
what about the unintended consequences? %$* 425
well, most people are concerned about the possibility of counter attacks. %$* 425
iran begins rocketing israel-- %$* 425
israeli nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks. %$* 425
but in many ways, the more dangerous response is, first of all, that an unprovoked attack on iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon, for nuclear deterrence. %$* 425
north korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. %$* 425
pakistan doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. %$* 425
and many in the world and in iran will come around to the view that maybe iran actually needs a nuclear weapon. %$* 425
a second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so far has made iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets, international-- %$* 425
not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales. %$* 425
and as a result, iran gains access to the world economy. %$* 425
it breaks out of its isolation. %$* 425
and even perhaps certainly gains access to sophisticated military technology. %$* 425
in the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't russia be prepared to sell iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused to sell iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like pakistan or others, north korea. %$* 425
i think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it that we, and for that matter, most israelis, fear about iran. %$* 425
and i think jeff has pretty much answered that question. %$* 425
it's not iranian invasion. %$* 425
it's iranian subversion. %$* 425
it's iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against their own regimes in many cases and against israel. %$* 425
so it's iranian influence; it's iranian capacity for subversion. %$* 425
it's not that iran is going to march across two intervening states and invade israel. %$* 425
that is a concern. %$* 425
and the fear is that they would be emboldened, and they'd do more of this. %$* 425
but i think you have to ask yourself, which kind of iran would have more influence with these dissident populations? %$* 425
not with governments, but with dissident populations in places like gaza and lebanon and other middle east states. %$* 425
an iran that had nuclear weapons, or an iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack? %$* 425
which of those two would give iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations? %$* 425
i think the answer to that is fairly clear. %$* 425
now, the argument that iran would be emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, i think, a real danger. %$* 425
but it's far from a certainty. %$* 425
it's not the historic pattern. %$* 425
you know, our major problems with the soviet union and particularly with china occurred before they had nuclear weapons. %$* 425
you know, soviet union gobbled up all of eastern europe before it had nuclear weapons. %$* 425
we had nuclear weapons, they didn't. %$* 425
china actually attacked the united states and korea and made a two-year war with the united states and korea. %$* 425
they didn't have nuclear weapons; we did. %$* 425
once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have anymore wars. %$* 425
now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused. %$* 425
both north korea and pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a certain stability in their relations with india, pakistan's relations with india, north korea's relations with south korea. %$* 425
there haven't been conflicts in either case. %$* 425
so the argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're not engaging in now-- %$* 425
and i think if you listen to jeff's list of all the things they're doing, you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing? %$* 425
and i think the answer is not much. %$* 425
thank you, james dobbins. %$* 13
motion is that israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
and now our final debater who will be speaking against the motion, shmuel bar. %$* 13
he is the director of studies at the institute of policy and strategy in herzliya. %$* 13
he is also a senior research fellow for the international institute for nonproliferation studies. %$* 13
shmuel, you can start making your way to the lectern. %$* 13
he served for 30 years in the israeli government, in the israel defense forces intelligence and in the office of the prime minister. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, shmuel bar. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 427
first of all, i won't go into the post-fact scenarios that were brought, but suffice to say that i could offer more optimistic scenarios. %$* 427
when you shuffle a deck of cards, then you play a completely new game. %$* 427
i recall that when we took out the iraqi reactor we thought it would delay it for three years. %$* 427
but it took about 10 years, and the iraqis did not get back to the level that they were before we took out the osirak. %$* 427
now, the arguments that have brought up the rational actor model, which i've already made some remarks as a historian about and the idea that deterrence works, and the other, the cold war paradigm can be applied. %$* 427
i would argue that we have to look at both of these assumptions in a completely different manner. %$* 427
first of all, the rational actor model. %$* 427
somebody, not me, mcnamara, said that castro was a rational man, khrushchev was a rational man, kennedy was a rational man. %$* 427
and three rational men almost brought their nations into utter destruction. %$* 427
and that was without any-- %$* 427
i mean, che guevara said that if cuba had to be destroyed in order to destroy capitalism, then cuba would be thankful for that. %$* 427
but in other words, rational people sometimes do things, or the dynamics between rational people, rational leaders, sometimes leads to things which are not rational. %$* 427
the other thing is that strategic surprises have happened. %$* 427
i don't think there's anybody here who would debate the fact that strategic surprises have happened. %$* 427
and when they happen, they happen because things that hordes of analysts and pundits and journalists have said are completely impossible because it is irrational that people will act that way, but they happened. %$* 427
so the fact is that these surprises happen, and they reflect dynamics which were not pure game theory rational behavior. %$* 427
now, the other thing is that if nuclear weapons make countries more responsible, then i would propose that the united states, which wants to reduce its nuclear arsenal, should now just divvy out all of the american nuclear weapons to the whole world, and then everybody will become very responsible, very rational, and peace on earth and goodwill towards men. %$* 427
now to the cold war paradigm. %$* 427
the cold war paradigm, let's define what it was. %$* 427
it was bilateral. %$* 427
it was a paradigm which, from a certain stage, had mutually assured destruction, with each party having a second-strike capability. %$* 427
it was with levels of intelligence that when these-- %$* 427
both the united states and soviet union acquired that capability, the second-strike capability, they also had satellites in the sky, so they had a reasonable picture of what was going on in the silos of their respective enemies. %$* 427
there were mutual communications after cuba, and there was also a perception of a taboo after hiroshima. %$* 427
now, when we're talking about a nuclear iran, we have to understand we are talking about a poly-nuclear middle east. %$* 427
the nuclear shiite iran is going to be perceived by the sunni countries as something that cannot be countenanced, that they are going to have to acquire their own nuclear weapons. %$* 427
in a poly-nuclear middle east where every country has a very small arsenal, they do not have mutually assured destruction. %$* 427
they have sort of arsenal which is "use it or lose it. %$* 427
if we are attacked then we won't have a second chance. %$* 427
we are going to have multiple nuclear states with these small arsenals with very low levels of intelligence. %$* 427
they won't have satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemy are. %$* 427
the size of the arsenals, it's better to have a lot of bombs than a few bombs because then, of course, you have the propensity to say, "well, if i don't use it now, i won't have a second chance." but then i want to go into something which has to do with command and control. %$* 427
and this is a very esoteric area. %$* 427
but in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclear weapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what's called "escalation dominance," you have to have very sophisticated capabilities. %$* 427
when you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of the middle east and the paradigms which existed in the cold war countries, you actually discover that most of the key elements which were instrumental in preventing nuclear confrontation during the cold war do not exist in the middle east and cannot exist for various reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, et cetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the delivery systems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly to rush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which prevented unintentional use. %$* 427
so all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region. %$* 427
we're talking about a possibility that not because khamenei gets up in the morning and says, "oh, what a lovely day, isn't it a great day to drop a bomb? %$* 427
" but that because the iranians do a nuclear alert, the saudis don't know whether it's directed against them. %$* 427
israel sees saudi arabia, and iran, and turkey on clear alert. %$* 427
everybody goes on defcon, and things get out of hand because none of these countries have the capability to control this spiral of escalation. %$* 427
now we're talking about something which is-- %$* 427
even if we say it's low probability, but low probability, high consequence, and this is where we stand on that. %$* 427
in other words, we can say, "oh, there's a 10 percent possibility that this will result in nuclear confrontation." well, 10 percent probability of total destruction is something that you have to think about. %$* 427
so, putting all of that together, i think that i would agree with mcnamara that rational actors or rational leaders do not guarantee complete rational processes. %$* 427
and as a final note, we also have to address the issue of the taboo of nuclear weapons. %$* 427
religious experts in iran and in the sunni world all ask themselves, "what is a nuclear bomb? %$* 427
" since there can be nothing which the prophet muhammad didn't speak about, they have decided that a nuclear bomb is like a catapult, it's just a big catapult, because a catapult used to be thrown over the walls of a city and you didn't see who it killed so it's indiscriminate killing. %$* 427
well, that's like a nuclear weapon. %$* 427
i think that somebody who sees a nuclear weapon like a catapult is-- %$* 427
shmuel bar, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two: james dobbins and reuven pedatzur, who are arguing for the motion that "israel can live with a nuclear iran." their argument is that, much as the u.s.learned to live with a nuclear china, israel can do the same, and it's not desirable, they're not saying that, but they're also saying it doesn't mean that the sky is necessarily falling. %$* 13
they portray iran's leaders as not crazy as is sometimes claimed. %$* 13
they're saying that the iranians will not want a nuclear war any more than the israelis. %$* 13
and, by the way, they say that attacking iran to destroy its nuclear program would only strengthen iran's influence and make it harder to contain than ever. %$* 13
jeffrey goldberg and shmuel bar are arguing against the motion, saying the risks to israel are unacceptable. %$* 13
they have not, in their statement, promoted an attack in iran, which they point out is not the premise of the debate, but they are depicting drastic consequences for israel if a state that hates it as much as the iranians say they hate israel would get its hands on a nuclear weapon. %$* 13
they say it would be a defeat for the good guys, it could set off an arms race in the region, nukes could reach terrorists' hands. %$* 13
and, bottom line, two or three bombs alone could destroy all of israel. %$* 13
it's not the cold war, folks, in that sense. %$* 13
so those are essentially the arguments that the two sides are making. %$* 13
i just want to start off the questions by getting to this notion of the moderating influence of having a nuclear weapon that reuven pedatzur talked about. %$* 13
he talked about the fact that when china-- %$* 13
when mao got the bomb in 1964, that he became a lot less, quote, unquote, "crazy" in that sense that he was depicted and thought of in the west; that he became a lot more sober-minded as a geopolitical thinker and strategist, because-- %$* 13
presumably because of the stakes. %$* 13
and i just want to put that to the other side and take it to jeffrey goldberg first. %$* 13
the notion that-- %$* 13
and you addressed it a little bit in your response, but i would just like a little bit more detail in recognizing what this argument actually is, that things did change in china at that time. %$* 13
so take on that question, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 428
first, i would say that there's only a limited amount of knowledge we can gain by analogizing the chinese communist party of 1965 with the mullahs who rule the theocratic authoritative state of iran in 2013. i really-- %$* 428
i don't want to stretch this to the breaking point, and i feel like that does stretch it to the breaking point. %$* 428
yes, it's possible. %$* 428
it's possible that iran will become suddenly a responsible party, but it is revolutionary in nature. %$* 428
i think by the time china reached nuclear status, it had been-- %$* 428
it was growing into something. %$* 428
iran's specific goal is to export the islamic revolution throughout the muslim world; its specific goal is to destroy israel; its specific role is to liberate bahrain. %$* 428
a country that has all of these goals which gains a nuclear weapon is not going to suddenly say, "all right, now that we have the weapon that will finally allow us to do all of the things that we've been telling you we want to do, we're not going to do it." %$* 428
okay. %$* 13
reuven pedatzur, jeffrey goldberg is saying that iran is not china of 1964 in significant ways. %$* 13
iran is no china, i agree. %$* 426
so we can go home now. %$* 13
absolutely, but china is not alone. %$* 426
let's talk about india, pakistan. %$* 426
let's see that south korea lives under the ship of a north korean nuclear umbrella. %$* 426
so it happens to every leadership that the-- %$* 426
and what do you think happens to them? %$* 13
and i want to take your answer back to jeffrey. %$* 13
because they know what is the price of using the weapons. %$* 426
there is no winning in nuclear war. %$* 426
so in this case, they know exactly what will happen and that makes them-- %$* 426
okay, so, jeffrey-- %$* 13
and let me give you an example. %$* 426
we're talking about the iranians, that they're irrational. %$* 426
let's talk about khomeini; he was very extremist, right? %$* 426
in 1980, when the war with iran began, iraq did, he said that he'll never sign a cease-fire agreement with iraq until they surrendered. %$* 426
in '88, they started launching missiles, conventional missiles, in tehran, thousands people dead. %$* 426
and he signed an agreement, because the price was too high. %$* 426
and we are talking about conventional missiles, not nuclear missiles. %$* 426
okay. %$* 13
so, jeffrey, reuven gave you the logic behind his analogy of china, that the gravity of the damage, the destruction that the weapons can do will change any leaders' thinking. %$* 13
well, first of all, let me come back to pakistan, because i've done a lot of reporting on pakistan. %$* 428
pakistan is moving away from minimal deterrence. %$* 428
we know that pakistan now is mating its weapons and putting them on mobile launchers, so i would caution not use pakistan as a great model. %$* 428
kargil crisis, for example. %$* 426
but let me just also say this. %$* 428
i think we're actually also talking about the wrong thing. %$* 428
the thing that i worry about more than-- %$* 428
are you doing-- %$* 13
are you doing a subject change to avoid the question? %$* 13
i am not avoiding the question. %$* 428
okay, all right. %$* 13
no, no, but i'm not avoiding the question. %$* 428
i am going directly at the question by changing the question. %$* 428
i don't-- %$* 428
i just think he gave you the logic. %$* 13
sure. %$* 428
and it's got some power to it, and i want to hear your responses. %$* 13
sure, sure. %$* 428
let me answer the question by saying i don't necessarily think that ayatollah khamenei is going to, one day, wake up and decide to launch a preemptive nuclear strike on israel because he wants to destroy israel. %$* 428
what i'm much more concerned about is accidental escalation leading to all-out nuclear war. %$* 428
think of it this way-- %$* 428
think of it this way: what happened two months ago? %$* 428
hamas fires rockets into israel, israel fires back, hamas escalates, israel then escalates. %$* 428
imagine if iran was in the picture with a nuclear weapon, right? %$* 428
now, just imagine this: imagine that iran, in response to israel's escalation, decides to move war heads closer to their missile launching sights. %$* 428
and the american satellites see this. %$* 428
you'll be living in a middle east of launch on warning. %$* 428
you'd be living in a situation in which the israeli prime minister is going to say the iranians are moving their missiles to strike us in defense of hamas. %$* 428
what do i do? %$* 428
we know the prime minister already wants to do this. %$* 18
let jim dobbins respond to that. %$* 13
well, i don't think the israeli counterstrike is vulnerable. %$* 425
i mean, israelis have nuclear weapons that can't be located, can't be destroyed. %$* 425
jim, could you come just a touch closer to your mic? %$* 13
and so i think that launch on warning is not a necessary strategy for the israelis. %$* 425
it might-- %$* 425
can it wait till tel aviv is bombed and then launch against iran? %$* 428
i think they would-- %$* 425
i mean, it would obviously depend on the circumstances. %$* 425
if they thought-- %$* 425
there's only three cities in israel the size of staten island. %$* 428
jeffrey, hang on. %$* 13

now, i’m a big believer in market economics too but i don’t want our auto industry to wind up in ontario, i’d like to keep a lot of it in michigan. %$* 291
so i don’t understand, i mean i do think profit is good but i think when one industry can basically drive another one into the ground and harm our country, regulation is outta whack, and let me just—one other point. %$* 291
the fda cannot take the cost of a drug into consideration when it approves a new drug, it just has to be better than nothing. %$* 291
that’s not by accident. %$* 291
congress prohibits the fda from considering cost-effectiveness of new drugs. %$* 291
that’s not the case in the uk, it’s not the case in other countries, it should not be the case here— %$* 291
paul krugman, i’ll come to you in just a moment, michael cannon, against the proposition— %$* 13
—reason you raised, you raised earlier, art, is that the industry has way too much influence when the government gets involved, and it’s nice to think that we could have this wonderful universal should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) coverage plan and we could just get the industry out of it, we could just not have the industry be a part of it, we could %$* 292
cut off their influence. %$* 292
but we know that the industry’s always going to be around, we know that there’ll always be drug companies and greedy private health insurance companies. %$* 292
and republicans who will mess things up like they messed up fema and they mess up everything else. %$* 292
so you can’t say that universal coverage is this wonderful idea and we can separate out this part-- %$* 292
this is an inherent part. %$* 292
unless you’ve— all the rent- seeking from the industry, and all the buffoonery from the republicans, unless you have a plan to abolish republicans they’re part of your plan. %$* 292
paul krugman— %$* 13
that, that— %$* 287
paul krugman for the motion— %$* 13
maybe we can put them in camps. %$* 292
that came— %$* 287
death camps. %$* 292
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 292
paul krugman for the motion, please— %$* 13
i meant happy camps— %$* 292
that came wonderfully into exactly what i was going to say, we have had katrina used as an example and i thought to myself as i always do it must be wonderful to be a conservative because, you can take control of the government, make a mess of things and say see, that proves my point, isn’t that wonderful. %$* 287
and i would also add— %$* 287
you can, you can be— %$* 292
—since john stossel— since john stossel has used vote-counting, you know, it’s not that the government’s, this particular government isn’t able to count the votes, it was sort of that they didn’t want to? %$* 287
michael—michael cannon. %$* 13
but do you—what’s your plan to deal with republicans, do you want to abolish them or are they part of your plan. %$* 292
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 292
medicare has its problems, but has continued to function. %$* 287
we have a well-established system, it continues—social security, is a system that’s working with high efficiency. %$* 287
the point is to get this thing— it is. %$* 287
if you have—pay any attention it works fine. %$* 287
and if you— %$* 287
if you pay any attention to medicare you have to know that one- third of the money spent is wasted, that it rewards doctors— %$* 292
and private insurance— %$* 287
—for medical errors— %$* 292
and private insurance? %$* 287
that’s the thing, i— actually, can i just—i wanted to ask a question. %$* 287
and— %$* 287
please—please do— %$* 13
—and i wanted to ask, actually two questions, to the audience. %$* 287
first, how many canadians, would canadians in the room please raise your hands. %$* 287
we have about seven hands going up— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
okay, not as many as i thought. %$* 287
okay, of those of you who are not on the panel who are canadians,, how many of you think you have a terrible health care system. %$* 287
one, two— %$* 287
we see—almost all of the same hands going up. %$* 13
bad move on my part. %$* 287
i’ve got a selected-- %$* 287
all right, i won’t try it. %$* 287
but i will say, that— %$* 287
we should check their papers. %$* 292
well, we’ve got—no, that’s %$* 287
sally pipes— %$* 13
—gotta be honest, and— %$* 287
let’s bring sally pipes into the conversation, she is against the motion. %$* 13
i just wanted to talk a little bit about medicare, remember when, in 1965 when medicare and medicaid came in, and the cost was about $3 billion, and it was projected to cost $12 billion in 1990. %$* 290
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) well in fact it cost $107 billion, last year it cost $427 billion, it’s estimated in 2017 to cost $884 billion, the medicare trustees way the program will be broke in 2019.there is no cost control in medicare, it is completely out of control. %$* 290
i think we need to give vouchers to people on medicare and put consumers and seniors back in charge of their health care. %$* 290
but the issue is, are—is everyone loving medicare. %$* 290
the recent congressional commission said, that one in three medicare patients is having a very hard time getting a doctor, and i have talked to many seniors, who are having a hard time getting a doctor under medicare. %$* 290
because the reimbursement rates by the government for the 8000 procedures on the list are too low and docs say i’m not going to do it. %$* 290
sally pipes, hold on just a moment because i want to come back to you for another question, i want to at this point tell the audience that in a couple of minutes i will be coming to you for questions and there are microphones being held by ushers toward the rear. %$* 13
and if you raise your hand, they will find you and then i will find you so just wave in my direction to get my attention. %$* 13
sally pipes and michael rachlis, you’re both born, raised, trained in canada, but hearing you, michael, argue for the proposition, and sally pipes hearing you argue against it, i’m—are you from the same country? %$* 13
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
it’s hard to tell. %$* 289
no, but seri—but what about— %$* 13
—what about the canada that sally describes— %$* 13
i think that, well, you’ve heard the other side say you can’t trust research. %$* 289
so, i guess that we just have to go on gut feeling and spin, is that right? %$* 289
so that i— %$* 289
did we say that—? %$* 292
—i think that— %$* 289
no, we did not— %$* 290
sally has— %$* 289
can we check the record— %$* 292
sally has mentioned some—well, disparaging the international should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) research, in fact, one of the people in the audience is one of the key people doing international research, maybe she can speak for herself, as to whether or not it is useless, but i feel that— %$* 289
—i feel that the international research is valuable and it shows, that by and large, other countries are delivering the same level of care, the unfortunate thing that happened to your mother, sally, i’m very sorry for that, could easily happen in the united states, it could happen in any other country. %$* 289
a family doctor, who doesn’t, you know, for a variety of reasons, take a particular complaint seriously, that stuff happens, the rate of medical error in all developed countries is about the same, although the studies have been done slightly differently, eight countries have done studies. %$* 289
in all countries, 5 to 10 percent of all deaths are preventable deaths that occur in hospital. %$* 289
so that—modern health care has some very serious problems and is—this country in fact is a leader in looking at quality in health care. %$* 289
dr. %$* 289
donald berwick, the founder of the institute for health care improvement, is the person, the preeminent person in the world, on this issue. %$* 289
but— %$* 289
sally— what about that though— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
—but canada doesn’t have problems with coverage, and neither does germany or france, and we don’t have problems with affordability. %$* 289
we have second-order problems because we haven’t dealt with the quality issues. %$* 289
michael, let me give sally a chance to respond— %$* 13
well, i mean if you look at the canadian health care system, you know, it’s not free, as michael moore, canadians pay dearly for the system through their taxes. %$* 290
what tax increases would we have to have here in america, to provide another $120 billion— %$* 290
i think you could cut— %$* 289
—for universal coverage— %$* 290
you could cut taxes. %$* 289
well, i don’t %$* 290
that’s what the congressional budget office said in 1994, that adopting a single-payer system would save so much money on extra administration, and then— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 289
but—well— %$* 290
—you could cover everybody. %$* 289
art kellermann— %$* 13
well, you, you ration— %$* 290
sally— %$* 13
—you ration care in canada, and people— wait, and my mother is not a single example, there are thousands of examples through—in the mainstream media from the toronto star to the globe and mail, it’s all there. %$* 290
people—a woman stood up on parliament hill when paul martin was prime minister, and she stood there with her health care, canada health card, and she said what good is this canada health card, when i don’t have access to the health care system. %$* 290
art kellermann. %$* 13
our er man. %$* 13
first of all i heard some real interesting comments made from the other side earlier and i just want to say, y’all can’t make stuff up should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) ‘cause none of you are running for president. %$* 291
mike and i are ineligible— %$* 290
second thing. %$* 291
sally, you mentioned about medicare. %$* 291
you know, we’ve had a recent experiment with private health plan efficiency, private health plans have started administering medicare. %$* 291
they’re getting paid an average of 12 percent more per enrollee, that’s nearly $1000 more per person than traditional medicare administers the same program. %$* 291
this is going to add 8.5 billion to the cost of medicare this year in 2008, and since 2004, those plans will have sucked an extra $33 billion out of medicare trust fund, without improving the care to beneficiary, so, again, michael, i think you’re right, we got a lotta people that have gotten their hands around the federal till, and have made federal government a cash cow. %$* 291
i think federal government needs to be a watchdog. %$* 291
let’s bring the audience into it because— %$* 13
but—i want to agree with, i want to agree with art. %$* 292
i want to agree with him about the— %$* 292
this is michael cannon. %$* 13
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
—about the, about how medicare advantage costs the taxpayers more. %$* 292
i want to agree that-- %$* 292
and i disagree with sally that i don’t think that we do any better in terms of health outcomes here in the united states. %$* 292
but those things don’t get you where you think they do. %$* 292
the fact that private insurance companies are ripping off the taxpayers through medicare is problematic, but the alternative is to let the doctors in the hospitals do that because they’re the ones who’ve been doing that for the first 40 years. %$* 292
i want to say one other thing— %$* 291
and—no, i’m not done yet. %$* 292
so, and the fact that we don’t lead the—i don’t think we lead the world in terms of health outcomes but that just means that we’re doing poorly, other nations are doing poorly, no one is innovating in order to make those improvements in medical errors, except, you know, we got the kaisers and the group healths out there that are actually doing this, and you just made an argument against having them participate in medicare, you’re trying to keep them—those innovations out of a government program. %$* 292
art, hold your response to that to perhaps your summing up at should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) the two minutes because we— %$* 13
can i just add— %$* 291
—do want to go to the audience and-- %$* 13
gentlemen. %$* 13
if you’re a member of the media we ask you to identify yourself by name and organization, otherwise it’s your choice. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
and remember, 30 seconds. %$* 13
isn’t the dirty secret that we cannot afford to have everyone have all the health care that they would possibly want, and so in america we ration it by price, and in other countries you ration it by lottery. %$* 9
paul krugman, let’s hear from you on that— %$* 13
yeah, no, that’s definitely true. %$* 287
there is, although, it’s not clear that we’re really at the point where that’s the critical limitation, that’s—at this point, just eliminating health care that actually does no good at all would probably be enough to save a large amount, that’s what the congressional budget office says, so it’s not a really a— in the very long run, what happens when we have the $30 million immortality treatment, that sort of thing, this becomes a big problem. %$* 287
look, i just want to bring—one more should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) thing, we’ve been talking a lot about quality of care but there’s one other thing that is very important which is the financial ruin that often comes from medical expenses. %$* 287
and that is preventable and that’s only in america, the individual who is finan—the family that’s financially ruined. %$* 287
every time i look at one of the studies that says well we can’t show that providing health insurance makes that much difference in health outcomes. %$* 287
first of all i don’t quite believe it but secondly, there is a tremendous difference in terms of not the medical side but the economic side and this is something again, there’s a risk, a fear, a terror of medical expenses, which happens among wealthy countries only in america. %$* 287
i’m glad, professor krugman, that you’re letting some economics creep into your remarks tonight. %$* 292
i want to point out though that the aarp recently released a study that showed that bankruptcy rates are rising fastest, among those people who are covered by our only universal coverage program. %$* 292
not only are they rising faster among that group than for other groups but for other groups, those bankruptcy rates are falling, how is that consistent with what you said about universal coverage protecting us from financial ruin— %$* 292
but that’s the— no, i’m not talking about bankruptcy rates, i’m should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) talking about all kinds of people— %$* 287
well, what— %$* 292
and you know, those are— %$* 287
—give me another measure of financial ruin— %$* 292
—the elderly, right? %$* 287
the elderly— %$* 287
give me another measure of financial ruin. %$* 292
no, come on, there are— %$* 287
all right, let’s go back to the audience, in the middle, you want to identify yourself. %$* 13
yes, i’m betsy mccaughey from the hudson institute. %$* 293
i’m worried about seniors and what the impact will be of a medicare- for-all system on them. %$* 293
in countries with medicare for all seniors are denied treatments that seniors in the us can get, the thinking is that the public health dollars are better spent on young people because the benefits will be more lasting. %$* 293
for example two years ago the british national health service should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) decreed, that seniors with wet macular degeneration could not get the drug lucentis until they had already gone blind in one eye, then they could get it to save the other eye. %$* 293
why should seniors in the united states take that risk and support a medicare-for-all system. %$* 293
sally pipes? %$* 13
exactly. %$* 290
well the thing is that in great—in britain there are other examples, tarceva, the drug for lung cancer that is available here. %$* 290
it—you know, if the nihce, the national institute for health and clinical excellence, a government bureaucracy says, tarceva is not cost-effective and therefore you’re too old to have it, you’re denied it. %$* 290
you can go out and pay for it in the market, but all of your services provided then under the national health service, are no longer available to you. %$* 290
is this what we want, this is what we’re talking about in congress right now with the cer, the comparative effectiveness research. %$* 290
we want to do this in the united states, this is going to destroy the innovation that john stossel was talking about, and it’s going to destroy our ability to live longer and healthier lives, it’s not what the american people want. %$* 290
sally pipes is against the motion. %$* 13
gentleman, on the right. %$* 13
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
there are a lot of personal stories being told tonight. %$* 9
and i’m glad to say that i have health insurance. %$* 9
and the idea of increased wait times for a medical procedure, that terrifies me. %$* 9
but then i think about the 15 percent of america who have no insurance. %$* 9
and how long are their wait times. %$* 9
so basically like what i can’t wrap my brain around is, how can a system based on companies, that make a profit on denying our care be made responsible for paying for our care. %$* 9
john stossel. %$* 13
well, you’re right, the insurance companies have a conflict, and, the insurance company has to balance, they want to pay for nothing, they hope none of you ever get sick and if you get sick they don’t want to pay. %$* 288
but, of course if they do that, word gets out, and they don’t get any new customers, so that’s how they have to balance that. %$* 288
you know— %$* 290
that’s how all businesses balance that, and— %$* 288
or, or they wouldn’t if you were able to choose your insurance should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) company %$* 292
that’s the other problem, that you have to buy insurance here in new york, from a new york insurance company, and because the politicians always wanting to give you more have loaded it up with all these extra guarantees, they—you must pay for viagra and in-vitro fertilization and acupuncture or hypnosis or pastoral counseling, i forget what’s all on the list that’s mandated— %$* 288
oh, okay, can i just—this is— %$* 287
you’re not allowed to buy from wisconsin where insurance costs a fourth as much. %$* 288
the reason you have to buy from a new york insurance company is because new york has community rating, which means that an insurance company cannot turn you down if you have a preexisting condition. %$* 287
and if they throw it open, across the country, then, people who don’t have a preexisting condition, people who are healthy can go shopping, and it’s not some kind of crazy thing because they want people to have hypnosis. %$* 287
actually— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 288
it’s because they’re trying to protect people who would not otherwise be able to get insurance, and that gets at the irresponsibility of the arguments that are made so often— %$* 287
thank you, paul krugman— %$* 13
—in this case— %$* 287
—art kellermann. %$* 13
there’ve been so many points out here that i wish we could address, one i want to talk about is waiting times, because you hear that all the time. %$* 291
the waiting times that matter, are the waiting times for things like, when you go to the er and how quickly you see a doctor for a heart attack. %$* 291
how quickly you get stroke care. %$* 291
whether or not if you’ve got acute or worrisome symptoms you can see your doctor that day or the next day or you end up having to be in an er.we’re turning away one ambulance per minute in this country from overcrowded private as well as public hospitals in the united states. %$* 291
if you’ve got to limp around for two months on a bum knee until you get a new titanium knee, i’m sorry. %$* 291
that’s not going to kill you. %$* 291
you don’t get to me for 30 or 45 minutes because you’ve been diverted from should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) three hospitals, you’re going to die. %$* 291
that’s the waiting times that we need to worry about in the united states and it’s not going to happen if we ignore this problem. %$* 291
michael cannon, against the motion. %$* 13
professor krugman mentioned that community rating laws like you have here in new york are intended to help the sick obtain health insurance. %$* 292
the leading researcher in the country on insurance markets, specifically the individual market where you buy insurance directly is a man named mark paul, he’s at the university of pennsylvania. %$* 292
and what he’s found after researching, what actually happens in insurance markets, is he’s found that those laws reduce—the community rating laws that professor krugman favors-- %$* 292
reduce the number of people with health insurance, and they don’t provide health insurance to many more sick people, and the reason is that unregulated markets really do a remarkably good job of providing health insurance to people with expensive chronic conditions, provided they purchase health insurance while they’re still healthy. %$* 292
so these regulations— %$* 292
yeah. %$* 287
if they— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 287
and—yeah. %$* 292
and it’s expensive and difficult to do, but you cannot have an insurance market unless people do that, because no one’ll buy insurance until they need it. %$* 292
no— you can’t have a fire—a homeowner’s insurance market if people can buy coverage after their house burns down. %$* 292
that is the market’s way of encouraging people to do the right thing and pay into the pool while they’re still healthy. %$* 292
ma’am, right—a question from the audience, ma’am? %$* 13
yes, i have a question about america’s competitiveness, and how it’s influenced by these issues. %$* 10
art kellermann mentioned gm, %$* 10
i was also thinking about another engine of growth which is entrepreneurs, in america, most new jobs are generated by entrepreneurs, not by big companies. %$* 10
and usually, entrepreneurs cannot offer health care because the rates are so prohibitive. %$* 10
so this in fact decreases our competitiveness. %$* 10
and this is just one issue along with the big companies, i mean, globalization’s not going to go away. %$* 10
i think it would be a relief to many sectors if health care wasn’t a drag on their profits— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 10
so your question is— %$* 13
i’m looking at big business and how it affects globalization— %$* 10
but you would like to know— %$* 13
—but also— %$* 10
but you would kind of like to know what— %$* 13
okay, i would like to know the pan—the, the two pan—the six panelists’, views on, how can we possibly keep going forward the way we are if we’re status quo, when we’re going to have huge competition from india, china, and other places— %$* 10
yeah— %$* 13
—that can— %$* 10
well, i— %$* 13
—out-compete us— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 10
—john, i think that’s right up your alley, that question. %$* 13
we already have huge competition from china and india and europe, these countries with universal care. %$* 288
and by and large we’re cleaning their clocks. %$* 288
america’s created 20 million new jobs while europe created two. %$* 288
so—two million, so, yes, gm has to pay more for health care than steel, and that’s awful, but in these other countries, they have to pay huge amounts in taxes, and that’s even more crippling. %$* 288
point of fact, i think the united states created 23 million jobs when some other guy was president %$* 287
and actually employment growth in europe has been faster since 2000 than the united states, so, that’s a little bit out of date. %$* 287
and i would like to add that— %$* 289
michael rachlis— %$* 13
—for the motion— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
i think you’re cherry-picking times, you picked the 20 years %$* 288
the united states has created— %$* 288
i don’t know what— %$* 287
—10 times as many jobs— %$* 288
—that 20-year period—that 20 million figure refers to, i think that was a number just sort of plucked out of air. %$* 287
okay, let’s stop there— %$* 13
—getting off the topic, michael rachlis— %$* 13
yeah, that in all this talk about health care with traditional economic models, that really, that is one of the main reasons why you folks have not been able to make progress. %$* 289
that is, using traditional marketplace models, focused on that as your ideology to analyze health care, which is not in any way close to being a traditional economic market. %$* 289
and to apply some sort of economic %$* 289
language the way we’re hearing from the other side, should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) to a system which is—where the supply side is massively regulated, for good reasons. %$* 289
you know, do you want to be able to—going to have to look up every single provider that you see to find out whether or not they passed their licensing exams or not? %$* 289
you know, i—the extension would—of this argument would be milton friedman’s one that, just absolutely no regulation whatsoever. %$* 289
but, that— %$* 289
fine with me— %$* 292
—that doesn’t deal with health care where it by and large for key decisions, consumers can never be at the same information level as the agent who’s recommending those services— %$* 289
sally pipes, you look like you’re dying to say something. %$* 13
i’m just dying to say that, we got—a lot of the mess that we’re in in this country including part of the 46 million is because, federal government gave employers a tax advantage to provide health insurance. %$* 290
and as a result, people in america, 60 percent of people in america get their health insurance through their employer. %$* 290
if you lose your job or you quit your job, we don’t have portable health insurance. %$* 290
if we make a few simple tax changes, such as refundable tax credits or an income tax deduction, we should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) really need to focus on growing the individual market, so that people can buy insurance across state lines, people can get the type of insurance that fits their needs, we can grow the individual insurance market because competition will work. %$* 290
and when we have 1900 mandates on insurance across this country, it’s impossible for an insurer to provide a stripped-down policy which %$* 290
two-thirds of the uninsured are in that 18-to-30 age bracket, and they don’t want to buy insurance with, as john said, in-vitro fertilization, alcohol rehabilitation. %$* 290
we can open up this market, and cover a lot of those people because of the 46 million uninsured, 17 million earn over $50,000 a year, and 10 million earn over 75,000, a lot are younger, they’re healthy, and they don’t want to pay $4,000 a year for insurance to cover things that they don’t need to care for— %$* 290
thank you, sally pipes, question down front, please— %$* 13
most—many of those folks have illnesses, and they cannot get insurance no matter how much money they pay— %$* 289
but if we open up the market, new competitors would come into the market— %$* 290
no, but— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 289
—and some would— %$* 290
this— %$* 289
—and they would be based on— %$* 290
health— %$* 289
—on condition— %$* 290
—health care is not a market like other markets— %$* 289
well, it’s not a right— %$* 290
—but it’s gotta be closer— %$* 289
—it’s not a right— %$* 290
—to being a market like other markets— %$* 289
time out, too many people talking at once is not making sense. %$* 13
michael, go ahead, michael cannon speaking against the motion. %$* 13
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 13
health care presents a lot of interesting challenges, and the question is not, oh, well, it’s special so therefore markets can’t do it. %$* 292
the question is, well, you know, markets and governments have advantages and disadvantages and, which one works best, which set of tools works best for this particular problem. %$* 292
i’ve always enjoyed hearing from proponents of universal coverage that the us has this market-driven, for-profit health care sector, you know, the government controls half of the money in our health care sector. %$* 292
and because of government tax policy, employers control another quarter of it. %$* 292
so, 75 percent of the money is controlled by someone other than the consumer, how in any way, is that a free market. %$* 292
i’m reminded of a favorite expression, expression of my brother’s, he likes to say, you know, you’re pissing on my shoes and telling me that it’s raining. %$* 292
what’s driving these costs and what’s driving these quality problems are those 75 percent. %$* 292
so—well, i’ll stop there. %$* 292
thank you, question down front— %$* 13
i have a quick question for dr. %$* 10
kellermann, you mentioned the mayo clinic as a model of efficiency and i think we all recognize it as a model of great health care, what’s the impediment right now to having more mayo clinics in this country, why don’t we have should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) them if the market can provide that, and i don’t know that we could look anywhere— people come all over the world to mayo clinic, why doesn’t universal health care coverage provide that in other places. %$* 10
the mayo clinic has a great philosophy. %$* 291
it’s very heavily focused on primary care, they’re very heavily focused on efficiency. %$* 291
you don’t have to be efficient to be successful in this country. %$* 291
i just have to talk you into getting all the tests that i want you to get, i need to talk you into getting the procedures you want. %$* 291
you know, we just talked about economics. %$* 291
everybody these days is complaining about gas prices with good reason. %$* 291
but if we ran our oil industry the way we’re running our health care industry gasoline would cost $16 a gallon and one out of every six american cars couldn’t burn it. %$* 291
we can do better than that. %$* 291
question from the back there? %$* 13
my name is tony meyer and i care about this issue too, and in 2002 i founded a company that today is one of the largest managers of defined-contribution programs for corporate america, and we work with general motors and ford and chrysler and many other great american industrial companies— should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) %$* 294
this had better be a question, not a commercial— %$* 13
there is, there is, this is not an advertisement. %$* 294
my question, and ms. %$* 294
pipes, you just mentioned it, no one has talked about the fact that, we have a unique health care delivery system which is really managed by large employers, it’s unique in the world. %$* 294
nobody’s talked about whether that’s a problem or a solution, should it be reformed, discarded, modified. %$* 294
i’d be curious what the panel thinks of that approach. %$* 294
well, and i did mention, i think it does need to be changed because if your employer— %$* 290
discarded. %$* 294
yes. %$* 290
i mean if your employer is paying about $15,000 for your health coverage, that might not be the kind of health coverage that fits you as an individual, you may not want that type, but if we open up the market, and give individuals the same tax incentive— because if you go out in the individual market and buy insurance, you don’t get a tax break on that, but if you get it in decreased wages but through your employer, it’s cheaper and you—and you’re able to get it because you’re part of that should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) pool. %$* 290
so we need to, as john says, actually discard that model and move away from it. %$* 290
you know, we can’t move away from it overnight, but we can make some changes in the tax code, that will allow the individual market to grow, and we need— we don’t get our life insurance, we don’t get our long-term care insurance, our home insurance from our employer. %$* 290
as i said, this was a gift during world war ii, and it was a terrible gift that has distorted in my mind a great deal of the health care system— %$* 290
paul krugman. %$* 13
yeah, it’s not the system you would design if you were starting from scratch and it’s not the system we want to end up with. %$* 287
but it’s a system that at least did the basics of risk-pooling for a lot of people, it’s a system that did deal with the problems of preexisting conditions and people being screened and does somewhat reduce the problem of insurance companies, not to deliver care but to, who can do the best job of finding who really needs insurance so as not to give it to them. %$* 287
so it’s not—i have no brief with that system, but, the idea that what we need to do is scrap it and move to an individual insurance market which has never worked anywhere, it’s the most amazing thing, that what we have coming from the conservative side is the belief that, universal health care, which works all across the world, is should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) undoable. %$* 287
and that an individual market, which has never worked anywhere, is the answer to our problems, extraordinary leap of faith. %$* 287
are you familiar with professor pauly’s research on the individual market? %$* 292
yeah, i’ve seen some, but you know, we just, it— %$* 287
well, you— %$* 292
—there just isn’t enough out there— %$* 287
—you’ve seen some, that’s where reality enters the discussion— %$* 292
time is up for this section. %$* 13
thank you very much to the audience for, actually, terrific questions. %$* 13
i want to remind you, just before we move to the summing-up section where each of the panelists will have two minutes, i want to remind you of how you voted when you came in if we can put the slide up again. %$* 13
before the debate, 49 percent of you agreed with the proposition that universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility. %$* 13
24 percent of you were against that motion and 27 percent were undecided. %$* 13
in the next 10 to 12 minutes you should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) will hear a summing up and then we will vote one further time, and our first panelist to begin his two-minute summary, john stossel. %$* 13
oh—okay. %$* 288
if you think health care is expensive now, wait till you see how expensive it is when it’s free. %$* 288
when it’s free there are no controls. %$* 288
i don’t think this side is saying the american system is a good system, it’s not a market. %$* 288
we’re spending other people’s money, government is already involved spending about half the money, third parties pay for seven out of every eight dollars, this is an awful way to pay for things. %$* 288
think how it would work for your car insurance worked that way, if they paid for your gas and your oil you wouldn’t care what gas costs and people would sell you $100 oil changes. %$* 288
that’s what’s going on in health care under insurance companies paying, or the government. %$* 288
and employment-based insurance makes no sense when four out of 10 americans change jobs now every year. %$* 288
government is not the answer, we don’t have government steel mills or government airlines anymore because they were awful, and once they had competition they went outta business. %$* 288
michael says medicine’s different, but, every profession says that. %$* 288
the truth is it—it’s true, you don’t—you’re not an expert, you don’t know which doctor’s the best. %$* 288
but you don’t know which car’s the best, you’re not car engineers. %$* 288
but should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) through word of mouth the good news spreads, the bad companies go out of business, the good doctors will take over, and we see this now, where there is a market, the tiny places, like cosmetic surgery, lasek eye surgery. %$* 288
the doctors give you their email addresses. %$* 288
does your doctor do that? %$* 288
they give out their cell phone numbers, the waiting rooms are nice. %$* 288
and the prices are going down, while the quality is going up. %$* 288
the post office can never give us what fedex can. %$* 288
thank you, john stossel. %$* 13
john stossel %$* 13
john stossel, speaking against the motion. %$* 13
speaking for the motion in his summary, paul krugman. %$* 13
in the course of this debate i actually felt %$* 287
i don’t know whether the audience will agree but i actually felt that john stossel in effect conceded, when he held up that trabant at the end of it. %$* 287
because that just shows, if all you can do is say communism, communism, east germany— i don’t want us to move to east germany. %$* 287
i just want us to move to france. %$* 287
now, the %$* 287
look %$* 287
government health care isn’t perfect. %$* 287
actually, government health care isn’t the issue, government insurance isn’t perfect, so is private insurance. %$* 287
there are horror stories, the nature of health care, is that lots of bad things happen. %$* 287
you don’t generally seek health care, because you’re should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) feeling great. %$* 287
but we have extensive experience, we have medicare, which is a system that is flawed but has actually shown slower cost inflation, than private health insurance over the past 40 years. %$* 287
we have the veterans health administration which is our little island of true socialized medicine in the united states. %$* 287
and it does very well. %$* 287
and above all, what we have is a system right now, remembering what the proposition is, the motion is that the federal government should guarantee health care. %$* 287
not that the government should run everything, not that everything should be under government control, not that we should nationalize the steel industry, which keeps on being run but as you know is not on the agenda or nationalize the auto company, but whether there should be a federal guarantee of health care for everybody. %$* 287
and that, i think, is something that american values, that our fundamental morality says is something we should be doing. %$* 287
thank you, paul krugman. %$* 13
and making her two- minute summary against the motion, sally pipes. %$* 13
although it would be nice if the federal government could solve all of our health care challenges, current events both at home and abroad show that it cannot. %$* 290
as a canadian, i watched first- hand the promise of free health care, and i saw it devolve into the should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) reality of a high tax bill, and long lines for advanced care. %$* 290
as waiting lists grew over the years to more than four months in 2007, an increasing number of canadians have traveled to the united states for treatment and paid out of pocket, whether it’s mayo, the cleveland clinic, or ucsf system. %$* 290
the number of illegal private clinics in canada has grown significantly over the last few years. %$* 290
the government is afraid to shut them down even though private health care is illegal in canada, for fear of an immense outcry. %$* 290
in june 2005, the canadian supreme court ruled, in a monumental decision, that the ban on private health care in quebec is illegal. %$* 290
quebecers are entitled to life, liberty, and the security of the person. %$* 290
long waiting lists do not give you that security. %$* 290
madame chief justice beverley mclaughlin said, access to a waiting list is not access to health care. %$* 290
claude castonguay, chair of a quebec royal commission on health care in the 1960’s recommended that quebec adopt government health care. %$* 290
the quebec government followed his advice, and they called him the father of quebec medicare, just like tommy douglas, the father of medicare. %$* 290
this year he released a report, an official government report evaluating quebec’s ailing health care system. %$* 290
his conclusion, it’s in crisis. %$* 290
he now urges legalization of private health insurance. %$* 290
americans believe in freedom and personal responsibility, not big government. %$* 290
they don’t want big government controlling our lives. %$* 290
the question is, should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) who do you want to control your health care decisions? %$* 290
an hmo bureaucrat, a government bureaucrat, or you yourself? %$* 290
by supporting universal choice in health care, and empowering consumers, we will achieve universal coverage. %$* 290
thank you. %$* 290
thank you sally pipes. %$* 13
i want to mention for the purposes of our radio broadcast that sally pipes is president and chief executive officer of the pacific research institute. %$* 13
also you’ve heard from john stossel, john stossel an abc news correspondent, co-anchor of 20/20, and author of the john stossel specials. %$* 13
and we heard from paul krugman, an op-ed columnist for the new york times, and professor at princeton and the london school of economics. %$* 13
we’re next going to hear from michael rachlis, michael rachlis is a physician and health policy analyst, the author of prescription for excellence: how innovation is saving canada’s health care system. %$* 13
michael, your two minutes begin now. %$* 13
yes, i want to mention that, that there is virtually no flow of canadians south of the border. %$* 289
the canadians getting health care south of the border are, like, ninety-nine percent of them are like my daughter who had a catfish spine through her palm— people on vacation. %$* 289
that there is the waiting list issue, i mentioned that it is a problem in canada, but other countries should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) with universal systems don’t have waiting list problems. %$* 289
it is not a problem of universal coverage. %$* 289
and in fact, in toronto right now, because of public response to the concerns about waiting lists, if you need cataract surgery, if you need your knee replaced, if you need a hip replaced, phone one number, you can be seen in an assessment clinic within one week usually, and you can get your surgery within a month after that, and it doesn't cost you any money directly, because you pay it in your taxes, and the taxes in canada as a share of gdp are almost as low as they are in the united states. %$* 289
and we’ve had surpluses for eleven years. %$* 289
i think what you're hearing from the other side are a whole series of anecdotes, and yet the overall research indicates that every other wealthy country in the world where you would feel comfortable visiting and living has a universal system. %$* 289
and i think what you really have to watch out for is what the new yorker commented on april 20th, 1992, referring to then the first president bush: the compulsion that drives president bush to distort the facts about canadian health care suggests that official american policy is in the process of becoming what conservatives in discussing the soviet union used to call a total ideology, a system blindly convinced of its absolute truth, and yet so fragile in its relationship to reality that it isn't capable of considering even the most obvious reform. %$* 289
surely we should have learned by now what happens to ideological systems that should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) begin to deny facts that their people can discover for themselves just by crossing a border. %$* 289
cross the border, come to canada, anybody in the audience, contact me, i will show you the canadian health care system, and then america should do universal coverage in its innovative fashion. %$* 289
make health care a right, and then do it right. %$* 289
michael rachlis summing up for the proposition. %$* 13
summing up against the proposition, michael cannon, co-author of health competition: what’s holding back health care and how to free it. %$* 13
he is the cato institute’s director of health policy studies. %$* 13
michael? %$* 13
the perception before we came in here, i was standing across from a man who was reading his program, and when he came to the part with my picture on it, he looked at the picture, he looked up at me, and he said, hey, that's you. %$* 292
and i said, yes, that's me. %$* 292
and he said, you're against universal coverage! %$* 292
because i think, and this look came over his face, the question that was forming was something like, what kind of a moral reprobate could be against universal health insurance coverage? %$* 292
and i know that i have a lot of family here tonight who are asking themselves the same question. %$* 292
my opposition stems from two beliefs. %$* 292
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) one is that people should have the right to choose their doctor, they should have the right to choose their health plan, and those things are often lost in system of universal coverage, almost uniformly. %$* 292
no, i think totally lost. %$* 292
and second, universal coverage is not going to make us healthier. %$* 292
we have serious problems here in the united states with rising costs, with low quality care, and we have health plans in the private sector that are trying to innovate with ways to reduce those costs, and to improve the quality of care. %$* 292
the only problem is, you can't choose them, because the government has said you can't. %$* 292
the only problem is that the government controls half of the money in our health care sector, and so the industry has, is able to block those innovations, because they want to protect their incomes. %$* 292
you can have a health care sector that guarantees universal coverage, or you can have a health care sector that continuously makes medical care better, cheaper, and safer, making it easier to deliver on that moral obligation that we have to help the less fortunate among us. %$* 292
you cannot have both. %$* 292
thank you, michael cannon. %$* 13
finally, the last word goes to art kellermann. %$* 13
art kellerman is not a surgeon, as i incorrectly said before, art kellermann is an er doctor at grady memorial hospital in atlanta, and a professor at emory, summing up for the motion universal health coverage should be should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) the federal government’s responsibility. %$* 13
dr. %$* 13
art kellermann. %$* 13
have you all heard the expression that there are no atheists in fox holes? %$* 291
i can tell you, in my experience, there are no libertarians in intensive care units. %$* 291
it’s widely said that americans can pick their doctor. %$* 291
the fact of the matter is, if you're in a non-group plan, or you're in a plan that doesn't contract with these doctors over here, but you can over here, every day i see patients whose care is disrupted because their plan has shifted doctors, they didn't get the deal they wanted. %$* 291
we’ve surrendered an enormous amount of freedom in this country to the private insurance industry, and to the rest of the industry. %$* 291
we can collectively together do better. %$* 291
in just a few moments you're going to vote again, and the six of us care a lot about how that vote turns out. %$* 291
but that’s really not the vote that matters. %$* 291
the vote that matters is coming up on november the 4th, and i encourage every one of you to do your homework, and do your homework on the candidate’s positions on health care, because they are strikingly different, and they, to some degree, break down along the lines of the debate tonight, and it should make a difference in the choice that you make then as well as the choice you make tonight. %$* 291
i want to close by going back to the bedside of that family. %$* 291
i didn't tell that mother the whole truth that night, but by staying silent and withholding the truth i left should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) her with something we both needed, which is hope. %$* 291
hope that her son would beat the odds. %$* 291
sometimes we see young people come back from catastrophic injuries and do ok.hope that georgia and every other state in this country would develop efficient, effective regionalized trauma and emergency care systems so everyone can have access to life saving emergency care. %$* 291
and most important, hope that this great nation of ours, the united states of america, will soon finally do the right thing and cover the uninsured so no mother need ever ask again, will my son get the care he needs? %$* 291
please vote for tonight’s resolution. %$* 291
well, we’re done, but for your part, but this was a really terrific debate, and i want to just, for all six, this isn't just art’s applause now, but for all six %$* 13
so pick up those voting keypads, you may recall that when you came in here forty-nine percent of you were for the motion that universal health coverage should be a federal responsibility, twenty-four percent of you were against, and twenty-seven percent of you were undecided. %$* 13
so, you can begin the voting process, which you seem to have gotten down the first time quite should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) quickly. %$* 13
number one you're for the motion, number two you are against the motion, number three you remain undecided, or became undecided. %$* 13
anyone need more time? %$* 13
everybody’s good? %$* 13
ok, i want to thank you, before we go to the results, i just want to thank the panelists, and especially all of you in the audience, because the questions were first rate, and moved the discussion into interesting places. %$* 13
i want you to also know that our next debate will be tuesday october 7th, 2008.the motion is going to be “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” panelists for this motion will be fred kagan of aei, he is widely seen as the architect of the surge; and also retired four star general jack keane, for the motion. %$* 13
against the motion is charles ferguson, the writer/director of the iraq war documentary no end in sight, and sir malcolm rifkind, the former foreign secretary and defense secretary of the uk, and a current member of parliament. %$* 13
these debates that you are taking part in as audience members can also be heard on more than a hundred fifty npr stations across the country, please check your local npr member station listings for the dates and times of the broadcast. %$* 13
also, copies of books by the authors are on sale in the lobby in plentiful supply. %$* 13
learn more about their ideas in depth. %$* 13
and i am quite serious about that. %$* 13
finally, we are pleased to announce that our december 2nd debate, where the motion is: “bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years %$* 13
” will %$* 13
not voting now please. %$* 13
should be the federal government’s responsibility” (9/16/08) will be recorded for broadcast on bbc world news television. %$* 13
to accommodate for that taping we will be moving the debate to a larger space, symphony space theater at 95th and broadway. %$* 13
this means that there will be more seats available, a limited number of tickets will be made available. %$* 13
and now to the results, a question of who won the room. %$* 13
before the debate, for: forty-nine percent; against: twenty-four percent; undecided: twenty-seven percent. %$* 13
after the debate %$* 13
fifty-eight percent are for the proposition, thirty-four percent against, eight percent undecided. %$* 13
thank you very much everyone for joining us this evening. %$* 13

we're seeing sexual assault, real rape, but we're also seeing time lags before the report. %$* 19
no rape kits. %$* 19
we're seeing alcohol use, and we're seeing the victim not wanting to see the perpetrator jailed, and that makes it very, very problematic for a criminal proceeding that requires all of-- %$* 19
ma'am, i need you to ask the question. %$* 13
so my question is, if student victims in these situations don't have the option of campus tribunals, how will they get protection? %$* 19
how will they get safety? %$* 19
i think that they can get safety through-- %$* 318
if we didn't have these tribunals, they would have safety through the school's reasonable measures that they could take, that they take all the time. %$* 318
they take them even without going through the tribunals. %$* 318
they just impose them, depending on their individualized assessment of what the safety of the campus requires. %$* 318
that does not mean what we need is a system, a shadow justice system that is operating in schools. %$* 318
and so there are many options for schools to undertake to provide for victim support. %$* 318
and they could be even doing a better job if they weren't so focused on this quasi punitive system. %$* 318
stephen. %$* 13
yes, i think that question really goes to the heart of one major difficulty with the proponent's position. %$* 320
many, many victims do not want to force the case into the criminal process. %$* 320
it's not that they-- %$* 320
they think a slap on the wrist is better. %$* 320
but, you know, they have a classmate who's immature, who's just kind of boorish. %$* 320
they don't want to ruin that person's life, but they want protection. %$* 320
and the criminal justice system is a sledgehammer. %$* 320
let's not kid ourselves. %$* 320
this is no joke. %$* 320
we're not talking about going from a slap on the wrist to, i don't know, a pinch on the cheek or something like that. %$* 320
we're talking about going from a slap on the wrist to a sledgehammer. %$* 320
we're talking about ruining-- %$* 320
literally, not just expulsion, but sex offender registration the rest of the person's life. %$* 320
and many victims, not only do they not want to put themselves through that process, which is one reason why they wouldn't report, but they also don't want to put their classmate through that process, so they won't report. %$* 320
and it comes back to the question that the other person asked a few minutes ago. %$* 320
how will you get the best prevention. %$* 320
if you have a system with tremendous disincentives for a victim to report, then nothing will be done. %$* 320
and that doesn't serve anybody's interests. %$* 320
up front here? %$* 13
front row on this side. %$* 13
thanks very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
michael kalupjon if the education department is in fact pressuring schools to achieve certain results in these cases, obviously the school can't be an impartial adjudicator. %$* 18
do we have specific examples of pressure being brought to bear on the schools in these sexual assault cases? %$* 18
jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
sure, we do. %$* 317
i mean, 50 schools are under investigation. %$* 317
they've been charged by the federal government with not enforcing and finding sexual assaults to be happening sufficiently. %$* 317
and the threat is hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding. %$* 317
so you have the threat which applies to all of them. %$* 317
you have 50 schools under investigation. %$* 317
and i can tell you from personal experience that the administrators, the deans, the title ix coordinators are very, very afraid of being found liable by the department of education, by the office of civil rights. %$* 317
and if you talk to them, you will hear this fear expressed all the time. %$* 317
we're going to sum up this round with what we are calling our two-minute volley round. %$* 13
this is a special exercise in which the debaters are asked to compress their comments to 30 seconds in the answer to one question. %$* 13
the question is going to start on this side, go to that side for 30 seconds, that side for 30 seconds, that side for 30 seconds. %$* 13
and at the end of the 30 seconds, you will hear that. %$* 13
and the question is to go back to the one that we left aside before, which is the issue of, which system ultimately will result-- %$* 13
or is resulting in the greatest amount of justice done, a system in which victims primarily would be-- %$* 13
or where will-- %$* 13
the question really should be, where will victims be most likely to find justice, by going through the court system or by going through, generally speaking, the tribunals that we're talking about coming up on campuses under title ix. so everybody understands the distinction between the question? %$* 13
i want to go to this side first. %$* 13
which of you would like to go first? %$* 13
stephen? %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
your 30 seconds starts now. %$* 13
i'll start. %$* 320
i think there's absolutely no question that you get more justice and better results if victims have options and if society itself has a mix of remedies and a mix of ways to responding more moderately or more severely, depending on all the circumstances. %$* 320
and it doesn't serve anybody's interest to have an either/or situation where either nothing happens or a ton of bricks comes down on somebody's head. %$* 320
your time is up. %$* 13
over to this side. %$* 13
the courts have the competence, the impartiality, the neutrality to do this properly. %$* 317
that's where you get justice. %$* 317
nobody's talking about barring the schools from doing anything. %$* 317
the question is-- %$* 317
i'd like you to send this message-- %$* 317
that courts should be the ones deciding these cases because that's where-- %$* 317
that's the institution we've built up for 200 years to do justice. %$* 317
and it's not happening in a conflict of interest ridden and error ridden process. %$* 317
we've had 200 years of history where the courts and the police have not taken sexual assault seriously. %$* 319
and the notion-- %$* 319
and the notion that closing off an option for victims and forcing them to go to a system that is beholden to different interests and disinterested in equality, disinterested in their civil rights and disinterested in their ability to maintain their schooling, it's not a recipe for justice. %$* 319
today, if you have an acquaintance rape situation, and you don't have some physical evidence of harm you get nowhere-- %$* 319
jeannie suk. %$* 13
you get nowhere. %$* 319
i think that it is clear that the idea that schools are more interested in justice for victims, that they're more interested in their well-being, that they're more interested in the correct outcomes, that is absurd. %$* 318
schools are entrenched in conflicts of interest, in all kinds of problems, in different loyalties to different entities, to alumni, to their current students, different political forces. %$* 318
and our court system, hey, it's really flawed. %$* 318
we know that. %$* 318
but that is what it's designed to do, to try to sort-- %$* 318
these out. %$* 318
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." and now we move on to round 3.round 3, closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
our motion again, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." and here to make his closing statement, jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
we sit for all of this. %$* 13
jed rubenfeld, professor at yale law school. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 317
many of you probably remember the case i'm about to mention to you, the duke lacrosse case. %$* 317
that was when a woman accused three lacrosse players falsely, it turned out, of raping her at a house party. %$* 317
what was the university reaction to those false rape accusations? %$* 317
it was panic. %$* 317
the coach was immediately fired. %$* 317
suspensions. %$* 317
everyone called for the expulsion of the accused students. %$* 317
88 duke professors placed an ad calling that rape a disaster. %$* 317
all around the country there was a rush to judgment, a presumption of guilt. %$* 317
television legal commentator, nancy grace, vilified those who even considered the possibility that a woman might lie about being a victim of gang rape. %$* 317
the local prosecutor, too, was taken in. %$* 317
it took the police and the courts and due process to prove that the rape accusation was a fabrication. %$* 317
how did we find out it was false? %$* 317
we found out because the toxicology and forensic evidence disproved the accuser's claims. %$* 317
we found out because there was transparency and professional evidence gathering and procedural fairness. %$* 317
had the accuser reported only to school authorities, and had that case been tried on campus behind closed doors, it's a good bet that those lacrosse players would have been promptly expelled and had their lives ruined with no way to vindicate themselves. %$* 317
but that case happened in 2007 before all this stuff got going, so that's not what happened. %$* 317
students were lucky. %$* 317
their case went to court. %$* 317
now, i'm not saying that such cases happen every day. %$* 317
and i'm not saying our courts are perfect or our police are perfect. %$* 317
we've got to do better. %$* 317
we have to encourage these cases to go to court through the police to get justice. %$* 317
i would just ask you to bear that kind of case in mind tonight when you vote on the resolution that courts should be the place where rape cases are tried. %$* 317
thank you, jed rubenfeld. %$* 13
and that's the motion, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases," and here to make his closing statement against the motion, stephen schulhofer, professor of new york university law school. %$* 13
the trouble with that duke example is the claim that if they had been expelled, they would have had no way to vindicate themselves. %$* 320
we've just heard from professor rubenfeld's partner that there are cases all over the country that are overturning expulsions that are based on botched procedures. %$* 320
so there are remedies, and there will be remedies, but one of the worst tendencies in american society today is to turn to the criminal justice system as the all purpose solution for every social problem. %$* 320
almost everybody who works in that system, no matter which side they're on, agrees that we have to reduce the reach of the criminal law. %$* 320
we have to be diverting cases away from the criminal law. %$* 320
and that's especially true of sex offenses because even a misdemeanor contact offense means sanctions that are much, much too harsh and much too inflexible. %$* 320
so i remember vividly my children aren't in college anymore but i remember the feelings that i had as a parent when they were. %$* 320
nobody wants to get a call from a daughter saying she's been sexually assaulted. %$* 320
nobody wants to get a call from a son saying he's been accused of sexual assault. %$* 320
but, god forbid, if you did get a call like that from your daughter, wouldn't you want her to have options for redress on campus? %$* 320
would you really prefer her to say that her only option was either to go to the police or drop out of school? %$* 320
that's not even a close question. %$* 320
limiting her to the criminal courts makes a terrible situation many times worse. %$* 320
and what if your son called to say he'd been unfairly accused? %$* 320
any parent would dread getting that call, but if it happens, which call would be more horrible? %$* 320
your son might say, "mom, i've been accused of sexual assault, and i might even get expelled or suspended from school." that's a nightmare. %$* 320
but would you prefer to hear your son say, "mom, the da down here is prosecuting me for rape"? %$* 320
if that's what you would prefer, you should vote for this resolution, but any parent who knows the criminal justice system knows that they-- %$* 320
taking a campus tribunal and the risk of possible campus sanctions, they would take that in a heartbeat. %$* 320
so we desperately need to reign in the criminal justice system-- %$* 320
okay, stephen schulhofer, i'm sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
and the motion is, "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." and here to summarize her position supporting this motion, jeannie suk, professor at harvard law school. %$* 13
let me close by sharing with you a worry that we haven't really talked about yet tonight. %$* 318
the trampling of fair process, which we see all over on campuses, should give us concern about the disproportionate impact on students of color. %$* 318
i have personally seen time and again allegations arising from the kinds of cases i was talking about, the ambivalence, the ambiguity, or misunderstanding about consent. %$* 318
they fall on minorities and poor students. %$* 318
and many others working on these cases have told me that this is a campus secret nobody wants to talk about. %$* 318
think about a nontransparent campus process as opposed to a transparent public hearing, without procedural safeguard, behind closed doors where unconscious bias can flourish. %$* 318
these are perfect conditions for biases and fears to reach inaccurate outcomes. %$* 318
one college administrator told me that what keeps him up at night is panic that his school could be one department of education investigation away from institutional death. %$* 318
that makes it impossible for him to consider what's fair and what's right. %$* 318
campuses must respond to sexual assault. %$* 318
the vote tonight though asks you to say whether shadow campus rape tribunals to decide responsibility and guilt are a solution. %$* 318
colleges have lost their way because of the impossible position-- %$* 318
and we covered that tonight-- %$* 318
the impossible position that the federal government has put schools in. %$* 318
i am sure officials from the department of education know about tonight's debate. %$* 318
and school administrators are watching too. %$* 318
you have the chance to send a message about how you feel about these tribunals that have been generated under this kind of fear. %$* 318
vote for the motion, not just because you care about fairness and process, but because you care about victims and about safety, and about effective responses to sexual assault. %$* 318
jeannie suk, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
and here to make her closing statement against the motion, michelle anderson, dean at cuny school of law. %$* 13
two quick responses. %$* 319
one, if you're concerned about racial justice and racial disparity, it flourishes in the criminal justice system. %$* 319
do you really want to send these cases there? %$* 319
two, if you're concerned about transparency, the plea bargaining system-- %$* 319
which, 60 to 90 percent, depending on which percentages you look at in the studies-- %$* 319
an overwhelming majority of cases end up plea bargained. %$* 319
and they are entirely non- transparent. %$* 319
those processes are non-transparent. %$* 319
i am the dean of a law school, so i spend a lot of time thinking about how to lead a complex institution and how to provide students with a save environment. %$* 319
put yourself in the shoes of a campus administrator. %$* 319
a shaken student comes to you and explains that she's failing chemistry because a student gropes her breasts after weekly labs. %$* 319
she's deeply distraught and she tells us she doesn't want to go to the police. %$* 319
now, under this resolution, you have to tell her, "i'm sorry. %$* 319
if he stole your lab homework or if he punched you in your-- %$* 319
in the face, i could investigate. %$* 319
i could switch him to a different lab section, or i could have him suspended, or send him to a different dorm, or have him expelled. %$* 319
but since he sexually assaulted you, our hands are tied. %$* 319
you have to report to the police. %$* 319
good luck." no. %$* 319
you want to tell that student, "i'm sorry this happened to you. %$* 319
if you change your mind and decide you want to report to the police, we will support you every step of the way. %$* 319
but in any case, we will investigate. %$* 319
and if we have enough evidence, we will take remedial steps to protect you. %$* 319
and we'll try everything in our power to get this resolved this semester." this debate is about equality. %$* 319
it's about what it means to have equal access to education when one student harms another. %$* 319
the only way to protect students' civil rights to an equal education is to allow the campus to act, to stop sexual assault, and protect students' safety. %$* 319
vote no on this resolution. %$* 319
thank you. %$* 319
thank you, michelle anderson. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side of the audience feels has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat. %$* 13
and it works the same way. %$* 13
take a look at the motion. %$* 13
"courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases." if, after hearing the arguments, you support this side, push number 1, the for-side. %$* 13
push number 2 for the against side. %$* 13
and push number 3 if you became or remain undecided on the issue. %$* 13
and again, we will-- %$* 13
we'll lock out those votes. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in just about a minute. %$* 13
but in the meantime, i wanted to say this. %$* 13
we've done 110 debates now and we sort of see patterns. %$* 13
and one of our patterns tends to be that when we have law professors as our debaters, it turns out they're not just good at teaching law, but they really provide excellent debates, i think, because they respect one another. %$* 13
there's a common language. %$* 13
and they're just in the spirit of litigious interchange. %$* 13
they bring such game to it and such intelligence. %$* 13
and i think we all learn from all of them in the way that they conducted this today. %$* 13
so, i wanted to thank them all. %$* 13
also, tonight, i hate rejecting questions and it was a pleasure to not have to reject a single question tonight. %$* 13
they were all excellent, even the ones that traveled on for a little while. %$* 13
they were all excellent, and they moved the debate forward. %$* 13
so, thank you to everybody who got up and asked a question. %$* 13
i'd also like to take a moment and thank our generous supporters, some of whom are here tonight, who make the debates possible. %$* 13
the ticket prices-- %$* 13
i said this before-- %$* 13
don't come close to covering what it does-- %$* 13
what it costs to put on one of these debates. %$* 13
so, everybody who has helped us out by making a donation, we're extremely grateful for those. %$* 13
and for those who haven't, we will be extremely grateful when, shortly, you go online and – donate to our website. %$* 13
it's at iq2us.org. %$* 13
and we'll take even small donations-- %$* 13
anything, because every-- %$* 13
all of it really counts for us and lets us keep doing this. %$* 13
and in that vein, i just want to tell you that the rest of the season gets moving. %$* 13
this is our inaugural debate of the season, obviously. %$* 13
but we're back next month on october 14th, we'll be here. %$* 13
and the topic we're-- %$* 13
we're looking at u.s.-china relations. %$* 13
and among the debaters, we have the former prime minister of australia, kevin rudd who actually is a china scholar. %$* 13
our new york season is also going to be featuring debates on topics such as infrastructure and the federal gas tax, which is actually how the highway fund is funded. %$* 13
it hasn't been raised for over two decades. %$* 13
so we're asking, is it finally time to raise the federal gas tax. %$* 13
now, if you've never heard of the federal gas tax, this is one of those debates where you'll learn a lot, and you'll find it actually a heck of a lot more interesting than you think it sounds when somebody says, "the federal gas tax." because that's-- %$* 13
that's what happens in all of our debates. %$* 13
you end up learning stuff you never knew before, and light bulbs go off. %$* 13
and if you've gone through the lincoln tunnel, or crossed the george washington bridge, maybe you're thinking maybe it's time to raise the federal gas tax. %$* 13
we're looking at central banks and their role. %$* 13
we've touched on this topic indirectly before, but we want to go at it more directly. %$* 13
and after what's come through the quantitative easing process of the last several years, it looks as though they are printing money around the world. %$* 13
in fact, they are printing money around the world. %$* 13
it's happening now. %$* 13
the question is that we want to debate is, is that a problem? %$* 13
is that a good thing? %$* 13
there are very passionate arguments on both side, that it's an emergency or that it's a "chicken little" situation. %$* 13
so we'll be looking at that. %$* 13
affirmative action, we've looked at that before as a-- %$* 13
strictly as a constitutional issue. %$* 13
we did that debate up at harvard. %$* 13
we are looking at it again because the supreme court is going to be taking another look at affirmative action, so we will be doing the same. %$* 13
we're going to be traveling in november. %$* 13
on the 2nd, we'll be debating the use of smart drugs at george washington university, where the issue is whether it's a fair-- %$* 13
whether students who have access legally to pharmaceuticals that assist them in-- %$* 13
in, let's say, focus and concentration, whether that's playing fair or not, or whether that should be regulated. %$* 13
on november 10th, we'll be in chicago at northwestern law school, and we will be debating prosecutorial abuse. %$* 13
you're all invited to that one, to watch, i mean. %$* 13
and tickets-- %$* 13
tickets for all of our debates are available through our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
and i said earlier, we're live-streaming even now, so those who can't get to our debates live, there are a lot of other ways to catch them. %$* 13
there is the live stream at our website and on fora.tv.you can download the iq2us app on apple and android mobile devices. %$* 13
and just look for iq2us in itunes or in the google play store, and you'll find us. %$* 13
it's actually a very-- %$* 13
it's a very gorgeous app. %$* 13
and all of our debates there are both this podcast, and as video. %$* 13
transcripts are there. %$* 13
you can also see, debate by debate, the research that we post; a lot of reading on the topics that we debate. %$* 13
so it's like a little classroom in your phone. %$* 13
and we just want to, again, say, go to our website to get up-to-date information on everything that we do. %$* 13
it's updated frequently. %$* 13
and follow us on twitter and on facebook. %$* 13
so, with perfect timing, i run out of things to say just as the results come in. %$* 13
so i have the results now. %$* 13
once again, the motion is this: "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases. %$* 13
again, it's the difference between the first and the second vote that determines who is our winner. %$* 13
let's take a look at the first vote, on the motion that "courts, not campuses, should decide sexual assault cases," before the debate, 56 percent of you agreed with this motion. %$* 13
12 percent were against. %$* 13
32 percent were undecided. %$* 13
that's the first vote. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 56 percent. %$* 13
they did not move up or down in their position. %$* 13
so zero percentage point move is the number to beat. %$* 13
so it comes down-- %$* 13
well, it's going to come down to what the undecided decided to do. %$* 13
did they stay undecided or not? %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team against the motion, their first vote was 56-- %$* 13
i'm sorry, their first vote was 12 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 31 percent. %$* 13
they pulled up 19 percentage points. %$* 13
the team against the motion is declared our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

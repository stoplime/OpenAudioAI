how they think diplomacy is going, how they think the current strategy is going, i just wanna read you an editorial from the jordan times. %$* 142
it says “arab capitols have all the right to be worried about a new adventurous us policy in this part of the world that may again not succeed as planned. %$* 142
washington surely cannot dramatically shift its policy vis-à-vis the countries in the gulf. %$* 142
the new administration lo—risks losing its barely- regained credibility in the region, if it does not consult its friends about its new standpoints in the area, new friends should not come at the expense of old ones.” this was not written at the height of the unilateralism of the bush administration, this was published in the jordan times today. %$* 142
the arab world is deeply concerned, that the message the administration is sending is it’s gonna cut some sort of grand bargain potentially with the admini—with iran at best, and at worst, leave an open-ended process which is this, we’re calling and calling and begging them to come to the table and they’re never responding, and oh by the way the clock runs, and a nuclear bomb appears at the end of the day. %$* 142
so, debating, you know, giving diplomacy a chance, not giving it a chance, we’re perfectly prepared to give it a chance but just listen to those closest to it in the region. %$* 142
they don’t believe that there’s any reciprocity on the other side. %$* 142
ken pollack. %$* 13
i could—first, let’s, you know, you’ve accused us of mischaracterizing, let’s not mischaracterize what the arabs are saying either. %$* 400
they are concerned about the negotiations, they are not saying don’t offer to talk to the iranians, they are not saying don’t talk to the iranians. %$* 400
what they’re saying is when you talk to the iranians, do this and this and you better tell us everything you’re doing and you’d better not do the following things. %$* 400
second, as nick pointed out, the answer to the issue is not, that we only have two people at the table and one won’t come. %$* 400
there is a third party in the room, as we keep trying to point out, that’s the entire international community. %$* 400
and the question i would put back to you and to liz, dan, is basically this. %$* 400
you are saying you want tough sanctions. %$* 400
how do you plan to get those tough sanctions without going through diplomacy. %$* 400
okay, i’d like to %$* 13
i’d like to bring you into the conversation now and i’d like to do it in the form %$* 13
i would find a way to say what you wanna say and answer, it’s a politician’s trick and %$* 13
i’ll call on you, please try to keep your question to 30 seconds or thereabouts, really a question, you can make an opening comment, certainly to state your premise but we don’t want you arguing as well because we have four very good debaters here. %$* 13
hold the microphone this close to you, and where’s the center microphone— gentleman right on the center aisle here, please. %$* 13
hi, i—i’ve heard nick’s argument, and i think without getting in a more just round, in a circle, i’ve, from my perspective don’t see where the iranians would give a lotta credibility to these threats of sanctions or war or anything else, so i would like to hear the panel kinda debate and address, what do you think the %$* 9
make, make the arguments for what the iranians have to gain, by giving up these nuclear weapons, and, what they have to lose. %$* 9
ken started to touch on it. %$* 9
but it hasn’t really been explored. %$* 9
ken, can you— %$* 13
and i would get into that to decide whether diplomacy can go anywhere. %$* 9
ken, put yourself in the position of the iranian government in a negotiation with the us, what do they want. %$* 13
sure. %$* 400
look, i think the truth is that the iranians don’t want to be in these negotiations because they’re very happy with the status quo, that’s the regime. %$* 400
okay, and that’s exactly a point that dan and liz have made, they’re absolutely right. %$* 400
we’re dealing with an iran that is at least bifurcated, what the people want and what the regime want are often two different things. %$* 400
and that’s ultimately the goal of the diplomatic process. %$* 400
is to put the regime on the horns of a dilemma. %$* 400
to say to them you can have what you want or what your people want, but not both. %$* 400
and you’re going to have to choose. %$* 400
and what we’ve seen with this regime is, while they are autocratic, while they control absolute power in iran, they are very sensitive to public opinion. %$* 400
they don’t like to be put in the position where it is clear that what they are doing is the exact opposite of what their people want. %$* 400
and what their people want is a thriving economy. %$* 400
their economy is in desperate straits at the moment, it is going down the toilet. %$* 400
comprehensive international sanctions could push it over the edge, and the regime is extremely fearful of that. %$* 400
on the other hand, what we can offer them if they do the right thing and that’s what we threaten them with if they do the right thing, if they do the right thing what we can offer them is the economic support that they so desperately need. %$* 400
the lifting of not just the international sanctions but of our own unilateral sanctions, the provision of trade credits, investment guarantees, and everything else. %$* 400
we say to the iranians, you have two paths. %$* 400
you can choose the path of darkness, you keep your nuclear program and your support for terrorism and everything else, and we will cripple your economy. %$* 400
and that is something that your people will not abide. %$* 400
dan senor— %$* 13
or, you can do the other way, and we will make your economy thrive— %$* 400
dan senor— %$* 13
i would just argue that, it is true, the economy is in desperate shape, 25, 30 percent inflation right now, 25, 30 percent unemployment, oil trading today about 60 dollars a barrel. %$* 142
they are in a much weaker, you know, less than half than what it was a year ago, they are in a much weaker economic situation. %$* 142
but if it—what ken is stating, that the iranian government, which is complicated and opaque and difficult for all the reasons nick said for us to truly understand, but if you believe that the iranian government, is effectively going to make a rational decision and they can be won over with inducements which is what he’s saying, what package of inducements could we ever offer them, ever, that would be better than the situation they would get from having a nuclear bomb. %$* 142
i mean think about this, a nuclear bomb would be able to guarantee that the us would never threaten them again, we would— if iran tomorrow decided that they wanted to go into bahrain which they consider one of the original iranian-persian provinces, if they wanted to go, slowly take over saudi oil fields, which would certainly help their economic situation, we would have virtually no leverage, we would pose no threat to them and as they’d try to further establish their own hegemony as i said earlier, in the region, having a nuclear bomb would allow them to cement that. %$* 142
what inducements do we have to offer them, that would be better than all that a nuclear bomb would give them. %$* 142
i thought that was a rhetorical question, but ken, you— %$* 13
come on %$* 400
dan, do you really believe that even after the iranians have nuclear weapons we’re gonna let them take over the saudi oil fields? %$* 400
we did a pretty good job of keeping the russians out of germany, i think we can keep the iranians on the other side of the persian gulf. %$* 400
i think trying to— this is a classic fallback position, trying to compare the iranian regime to other governments, and other situations— %$* 142
but, they’re much weaker, that’s my point. %$* 400
yeah, but potentially—and there’s also potentially an internal divide and fissures within the regime that’s divided between those who are motivated by national interests and those that are radical theocrats, as president obama has described them, that aren’t terribly rational, and trying to figure out and game them out and hope that we can win over and resolve those fissures in the short period of time before they actually have a nuclear bomb, to me, is a pretty big gamble. %$* 142
and your partner, liz cheney? %$* 13
yeah, i mean i think it’s, you know, terrific to sort of sit here and say here is the ideal set of circumstances, we gotta have these tough sanctions and, liz and dan, how are you gonna get those tough sanctions, you know, without doing diplomacy. %$* 230
and i would say the history of the relationship shows, we aren’t gonna get tough sanctions with diplomacy, the current diplomacy that we’ve got, at the end of the day, what dan is—the argument dan’s making is absolutely right that, the ira— there are not inducements at this point, there are not inducements that make the iranians better off than having the bomb. %$* 230
what does cause the iranians to alter their behavior and what we have seen historically is if they believe that there is a credible threat of military force if they don’t alter their behavior. %$* 230
this is also true of our european allies. %$* 230
and as you’re talking about this diplomacy i think we need to think about the motives of all of the people, all the partners involved here. %$* 230
you know, the europeans, as we’ve seen throughout, they like their commercial relationships with iran, and they don’t like the notion that the united states is gonna use military force against iran. %$* 230
if they believe the threat of military force is on the table, that’s frankly the only thing i’ve seen that convinces them they better get serious about sanctions. %$* 230
we have not seen them serious about sanctions, and i think the idea that we’re gonna call this current diplomacy strong or tough diplomacy, it simply doesn’t bear out if you look at the facts. %$* 230
this is diplomacy with no teeth, this is, you know, an open hand, direct and unconditional. %$* 230
and— %$* 230
question from the second row. %$* 13
you can stand up and, if you’re a member of the press please identify yourself. %$* 13
pardon me, i’m nervous with this distinguished panel and this audience. %$* 9
i’ve one simple question for the burns-pollack team, with this basic background. %$* 9
hope springs eternal, but history tends to repeat itself. %$* 9
and we’ve had 30 years of diplomacy with a capital or small “d.” we’ve had, burns admits that in the, i think he said, ’96 or ’97, we gave a real good deal, and iran flipped us whatever you wanna insert after that. %$* 9
my question is this. %$* 9
in the concept of we don’t know what iran wants, i mean, we listen— %$* 9
you know—go to your question— %$* 13
my question is, can either burns or pollack point to any single thing, over the past 30 years, including obama’s welcome mat of the last few months, that gives us any hope that history won’t repeat itself, and that diplomacy has ever gone anywhere. %$* 9
thank you very much. %$* 399
thank you for your question. %$* 399
i just fundamentally disagree with liz and dan, that there’s been diplomacy, over the last 30 years, i am a professional diplomat, i now teach diplomacy, at a university. %$* 399
it hasn’t been diplomacy. %$* 399
we have not had sustained engagement with the iranians. %$* 399
and the problem i have and what i find slightly irresponsible about the other side’s position, they wanna strangle this current diplomatic initiative of president barack obama, in its infancy. %$* 399
it’s about 30 days old. %$* 399
president obama rolled out most of what he thinks should happen about 30 days ago. %$* 399
i think what you can expect, is that after the june 12th presidential elections in iran, you’re gonna see iran accept negotiations, you’re gonna see iran at the negotiating table. %$* 399
my best judgment would be that first round of talks will likely fail. %$* 399
i’m trying to strengthen us, in arguing for this policy, for the sanctions that come, and trying to strengthen us to find a way to deny iran a nuclear weapons capability. %$* 399
if you start from the presumption that diplomacy is soft, and weak and un- american, and there are some people who believe that, then i can’t help you. %$* 399
because that—that you’re just left with a military option. %$* 399
i think we’ve gotta stage this, we’ve gotta think 15 or 16 moves down the chess board. %$* 399
i think that’s what president obama is trying to do, give him a chance, and let’s show a little patience for diplomacy to play out. %$* 399
neither dan nor i are trying to strangle these efforts, in fact we are very hopeful that these efforts will succeed, i think everybody on this panel wants diplomacy to succeed in stopping iranians’ nuclear weapons program. %$* 230
but i think that you have got to be realistic about what it will take to have that success. %$* 230
and when i hear nick talk about 15 or 16 moves down the table and the first round is gonna fail, people need to look at how the iranians in the past have described these discussions with us. %$* 230
in august of 2005, the chief iranian nuclear negotiator gave an interview on iranian television in which he explained in great detail and with great pride, that he was using the negotiations in order to gain the time that they needed to get the nuclear program up and running. %$* 230
he admitted it, he was open about it. %$* 230
the notion that, we’ve got 15 or 16 moves and we’ve got all kinds of time, i mean, i’d like to hear nick explain how he can feel comfortable that we’ve got the time to undertake the kind of slow and cautious, toothless diplomacy, that we’re currently engaged in. %$* 230
i just wanna correct the record in one— %$* 399
did—did he really say toothless at point— %$* 13
no, i said— %$* 230
i want to correct the record in one aspect, when ahmadinejad was elected and sworn in in august of 2005 and when the iranian negotiator made those remarks, he was not referring to negotiations with the united states, we were not in negotiations. %$* 399
the british and french and germans were. %$* 399
the russians and chinese were in it. %$* 399
the diplomacy has evolved, so to suggest somehow, that because of the european negotiations failed in 2005, the united states should therefore not enter negotiations, is just not historically right. %$* 399
in the way that, in the way that liz put it— %$* 399
no. %$* 230
what i’m suggest— %$* 230
and i think that anyone who—i’m just gonna finish my thought if i could. %$* 399
i think that anybody— i think that anybody who understands diplomacy and tries to learn from it understands that it doesn’t occur over a 30, or 40-day time period and here’s the weakness, in liz and dan’s argument. %$* 399
they’re arguing against something that has just begun. %$* 399
and we’ve gotta have the patience and determination to see this first phase concluded, or else, or else we leave ourselves with no appreciable option to resolve this peacefully if that’s possible. %$* 399
dan, very briefly— %$* 13
we’re not—wait, i just need— %$* 230
i wanna go to—back to the audience but dan, very briefly respond to that. %$* 13
i will give my time— %$* 142
you will cede your time— %$* 13
—to my partner here— %$* 142
—to your partner. %$* 13
that was a very wise move— %$* 13
i, you know %$* 142
to say diplomacy has not begun ignores the 30 years of history. %$* 230
and the point that i was making about the iranian nuclear negotiator was, the iranians used negotiations to stall, they used negotiations to buy time. %$* 230
so, nick, are you saying you don’t believe that they’ll use negotiations to buy time if we’re at the table? %$* 230
no, i assumed you listened respectfully when i was speaking as i did when you were. %$* 399
i said— i said, we should be tough-minded. %$* 399
we should impose a time limit on the discussions. %$* 399
we should work out the sanctions regime with the russians and chinese before we sit down with the iranians, and we should leave force on the table. %$* 399
that’s tough-minded diplomacy, it’s certainly not toothless— %$* 399
that’s not the current— %$* 230
question from the cen— %$* 13
—that’s not the current diplomacy— %$* 230
question from the center, please. %$* 13
thank you very much for an incredibly interesting panel and very illuminating comments %$* 10
i think you’re offering very compelling arguments for both sides and i’m actually undecided at this point. %$* 10
to help me decide, it would be really great to know what both sides of the panel think in terms of, who exactly are the key allies we wanna sign up for the tough sanctions against iran. %$* 10
and what exactly are the tough sanctions, because, i have—i’m just wondering if both sides agree on what exactly both of those are. %$* 10
thanks. %$* 10
nick. %$* 13
that’s an excellent question and i think the tough allies that we need are not the europeans. %$* 399
the europeans have actually cut their trade with iran by two thirds since 2005, they’re moving in the right direction. %$* 399
what has happened to us. %$* 399
the chinese have fundamentally watered down and violated the un sanctions, they’re the number-one trade partner with iran. %$* 399
the russians sell arms to iran. %$* 399
the arabs, who profess to be very concerned about the rise of iran, trade with iran every day. %$* 399
specifically saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, the japanese and the south koreans trade. %$* 399
so what president obama has to do, and what we tried very hard to do in our time in office, was to get all those countries to agree, that if the united states tries diplomacy it’s not gonna be feckless and toothless, that they will join us, they will commit to us. %$* 399
we did not have that agreement, in 2006, specifically, we should try to get it now. %$* 399
question from the far side? %$* 13
i have two questions, my first question is, isn’t it a little bit— %$* 10
i’d just like you to actually pick your favorite question. %$* 13
okay, my favorite question— they go hand in hand but it’s okay. %$* 10
it’s directed toward miss cheney. %$* 10
isn’t it a little bit convenient to place a historical context—historically contextualize your argument just to 1979, being that the united states helped to overthrow iran and iran’s first democratically elected government in 1953? %$* 10
that’s not something that happened 200 years ago, it’s something that happened in my grandfather and my mother’s lifetime so it’s pretty, i would imagine for people living in iran it’s still a pretty salient point. %$* 10
well, i think the reason that you start in 1979 is because it’s the same government, it’s the government that took over after the revolution in 1979, and the people that we’re dealing with today are the heirs of the people that we were dealing with in 1979.now, there has been in many instances and we talked about it, you know, sort of this elusive attempt to find reformers, and i think a lot of what ken did for example, during the clinton administration was, attempt to reach out to those reformers. %$* 230
you know, people talk about who’s up and who’s down, but at the end of the day i think what you’ve got is clearly a situation where, the government we’re dealing with today, in terms of its ideology, its objectives, its desires and its approach to the rest of the world and its approach to us, are in fact, you know, they—they’re the islamic government of iran, they’re the inheritors of those that we were dealing with in ’79, which is why, i began in ’79, i mean you could go back thousands of years presumably as well. %$* 230
can i just— %$* 142
okay, your partner would like to add to that— %$* 13
yeah, i would just like to clarify one point ‘cause there’s clearly %$* 142
and— %$* 142
is this in relation to the question or— %$* 13
it’s connected— %$* 142
—looking back, okay— %$* 13
it’s connected— %$* 142
no, i don’t mind, i just— %$* 13
yeah— %$* 142
—wanna know, what the framework is— %$* 13
nick and ken keep setting up this false choice. %$* 142
either diplomacy, or military action. %$* 142
and what liz and i are arguing, is we are all for diplomacy. %$* 142
we are for diplomacy that actually results in a diplomatic process beginning. %$* 142
the process has not begun. %$* 142
we are—and we believe that that diplomatic process will only get going, if it is backed up by credible threat of military action, we are not arguing for military action. %$* 142
but we are—we do believe that the obama administration has to persuade our allies— %$* 142
but i—i believe i’ve heard the other side say exactly the same thing— %$* 13
but,— %$* 142
right— %$* 230
—but hold on— but, can i— %$* 142
that’s right, all four of us are arguing for the motion— %$* 230
exactly, president obama— president obama’s strategy does not involve that, so if nick and ken wanna come to our side and acknowledge that that is the problem. %$* 142
president obama has not made clear that military action is serious and credible— %$* 142
all right, let me bring in ken—let me bring in ken, nick, ‘cause— %$* 13
okay— %$* 400
—he hasn’t spoken in a bit— %$* 13
i think— i was thrilled to hear liz say that you guys are in favor, you want diplomacy to work. %$* 400
the question i would have for you is, what is it about what we’re doing now that you think is inadequate, what more do you want to do. %$* 400
‘cause my guess is not only would we sign up for it, my guess is the obama administration would sign up for it too. %$* 400
i don’t know if the obama administration’s gonna be inviting the cheney-senor team into %$* 142
to prescribe their policy on iran, but hey, you know, stranger things have happened— %$* 142
for you. %$* 400
you know? %$* 142
change is coming to america. %$* 142
it’s the middle east. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 142
nick. %$* 13
nick, did you wanna follow up ‘cause i have another question or i can go to— %$* 13
i think that dan has not given president obama sufficient credit. %$* 399
i heard him say during the campaign on multiple occasions, that he believed that we should leave the use of force on the table. %$* 399
we haven’t seen the full articulation of the policy. %$* 399
i have every reason to believe it’s gonna be very hard- headed and very tough-minded, it’ll include all the things that all of us are talking about. %$* 399
so to suggest that somehow this is feckless, toothless, soft, ineffective diplomacy, when it’s likely to include all the elements that liz and dan have suggested, i think is a little bit premature. %$* 399
i don’t disagree, i hope president obama comes forth with that, he hasn’t done so yet, my only point is if you are going to have a credible use—if you’re gonna have a credible threat of force, you have to articulate a timeline, a trigger point, and a credible threat of force. %$* 142
president obama has done all the things that you have, have hoped he would do, except that last piece, so i don’t know why anybody in the iranian regime, or among our allies, would take that threat that you’re positing as serious when the president himself has not taken it— %$* 142
nick, last year during the campaign you wrote in support of the president’s offer to talk to adversaries. %$* 13
you wrote a piece in newsweek in which you said, “we should have enough self- confidence to talk to your adversaries,” why is it a matter of self- confidence. %$* 13
there is this notion, in some parts of the political spectrum that we should not talk to governments with which we disagree. %$* 399
i don’t think that is in our self-interest. %$* 399
and i think we oughta have the self-confidence to understand that whoever represents the united states of america at the negotiating table is going to be tough- minded. %$* 399
is going to try to achieve— %$* 399
but you’re not hearing that argument from this other side of the table today, that’s not the— %$* 13
not today. %$* 399
but certainly i think one of the weaknesses of the clinton approach and frankly, the approach in which i was involved, was that we didn’t have enough self-confidence to get to the table and trust ourselves, i think we weakened the diplomatic effort in 2006, by not attempting to talk to the iranians, so i think the united states needs to engage those governments with, with which we disagree, zimbabwe,— %$* 399
liz— %$* 13
and iran, and burma, governments like that. %$* 399
liz cheney. %$* 13
how much time do you give the iranians. %$* 230
how much time would you give the iranians. %$* 230
so we’ve gotta have this tough-minded diplomacy that you promise is coming, although i have to say the resolution says it’s going nowhere now, just to remind people in the audience. %$* 230
but how much time. %$* 230
i mean i understand what you’re saying %$* 230
i don’t see the word “now.” %$* 400
it says “is going nowhere,” it’s present tense. %$* 230
but at any rate, um %$* 230
but it’s, it’s a serious question— %$* 230
you could read the future tense into that— %$* 400
it’s a—no you can’t actually— %$* 230
of course you can. %$* 400
liz, if you can— %$* 399
it’s a serious question— %$* 230
—if you’re in favor of diplomacy too let us throw it back to you, how much time would you give it. %$* 400
i would give it very little time. %$* 230
how much— %$* 400
how much? %$* 399
and i would say— i would give it basically enough time that we could actually sort of test out, the extent to which we’re serious about using force, i mean i, you know, my own view is the window is closing pretty fast here. %$* 230
i would say, you know, we’re very close to the point where, the iranians themselves may in fact be near the point where any action that we take is insufficient to prevent them from actually gaining the value and the benefit of having at least the threat of a nuclear program— %$* 230
so is that six months or 12 or 18? %$* 400
you know, i’d say i’m— %$* 230
but the—but the question— %$* 13
i’m closer— %$* 230
—was actually put to you— %$* 13
i know, that’s why i’m putting it back to liz ‘cause she’s saying— %$* 400
but, but— %$* 13
—she’s in favor too— %$* 400
but do you—but do you— %$* 13
maybe— %$* 400
—have an answer for her— %$* 13
john, maybe the problem is just three months, maybe liz believes six and we believe nine. %$* 400
no, no, but it’s not just time, it—time as you heard me say at the beginning, time is key. %$* 230
now i— my patience has, as you know, been tested and i think probably is closer to the breaking point than nick’s is. %$* 230
and i think that’s a responsible position. %$* 230
because i think to take the position that you guys are taking which is, yes, it’s definitely going somewhere, although it hasn’t really started yet, and once it starts, it’s gonna take us a long time because, you know, to do this professionally— %$* 230
that’s not our position at all, liz, our position is that— %$* 400
you’ve said all of those things— %$* 230
our—no, no, no, that’s absolutely untrue, and you go back and look at the transcript— %$* 400
all right, but nick said— %$* 230
what we said was— %$* 400
okay, we’re getting to transcript review— %$* 13
—what, what, that— %$* 400
—i wanna move on to another question— %$* 13
—we need to pull this out to get the allies onboard— %$* 400
gentleman in the second row— %$* 13
—for the tough sanctions— %$* 400
gent—gentleman— %$* 13
what makes you think— %$* 230
—in the second row has been very patient— %$* 13
but what makes you think— %$* 230
if a game-changer is required, and it seems to be, would russia support effective sanctions if we rethought our position on missiles in eastern europe, and are there similar quid pro quos we could offer the chinese for them to support effective sanctions, and would that not change the whole situation. %$* 9
ken? %$* 13
that’s up your alley. %$* 13
okay, you’ve asked a critical question, and this is part of what has to happen with the diplomacy. %$* 400
we don’t know the answers to those questions. %$* 400
but frankly, if we can make some of those deals, if we can do some old-fashioned horse trading, and different people may have different views on what deals we should cut, but if we can do that to get them onboard, maybe we will. %$* 400
i think we probably ought to. %$* 400
but we’re never going to know until we suss them out. %$* 400
until we go to them and ask them what’s it gonna take. %$* 400
situation, we have to remember this, we’re in a situation where we have offered, not just to talk. %$* 230
you know, we offered to remove our objection to their wto accession, we gave ‘em spare parts, we lifted pieces of our sanctions. %$* 230
you know, we’ve offered a whole range of things to them. %$* 230
and so for us to now be in a position where we’re going again to the iranians and you know, to say to them, okay, well that didn’t work but how about if we do this for you, how about if we do this for you— each time, the iranians refuse to take the steps that the international community has said they should take. %$* 230
nick and ken seem to think we oughta go back to them again and say okay, well that wasn’t enough for you, what about this. %$* 230
and i just think that’s a dangerous situation to be in when they are getting closer every day to having a nuclear weapon. %$* 230
the question. %$* 400
the question was what do we do with the russians and chinese. %$* 400
so we’re not talking about constantly going back to the iranians. %$* 400
what we’re talking is going for the first time to the russians and the chinese. %$* 400
but it is a key point, it—you know, if in response to the iranian intransigence, we decide that we are no longer gonna support the missile defense system, that in fact has helped to protect and will help to protect some of our most important allies in the world against the eventuality, the potential of an iranian nuclear weapon, that to me is a concession to the iranians. %$* 230
now maybe, you know, it’s a concession we’re making to the russians, but it’s a concession to the iranians. %$* 230
i would not make those concessions right now either, i agree with liz on this, i mean you’ve asked a great question. %$* 399
the russians and chinese should be interested in stopping an iranian nuclear- weapons development program, because of their own interests. %$* 399
i think what’s happened is they haven’t quite believed that we’re ready to give diplomacy a chance, therefore, if we can show a little faith in diplomacy for a little bit of time, i think we’re more likely to get them onboard than otherwise, but i wouldn’t trade the missile defense systems in eastern europe with the russians. %$* 399
question, sir? %$* 13
to have been on the hot seat all night— %$* 9
can you start your question again— %$* 13
yes— %$* 9
—because your mic was off— %$* 13
so, i’ll keep you there. %$* 9
one of the reasons i’m voting for %$* 9
that the iran—or the diplomacy is going nowhere, is something that our ally, israel, had mentioned a few weeks back, and incidentally, i was at the first debate, and no one mentioned israel at all and they’re the country that had the most to lose, and they’re our friends. %$* 9
my question is when %$* 9
prime minister netanyahu said the other day in a very undiplomatic way, that if the united states doesn’t take care of this, we are. %$* 9
now i thought that was shocking. %$* 9
that indicated, that they think, our diplomacy is sort of 1938 vintage with an umbrella, and a v sign, and it’s going nowhere. %$* 9
so, if mr. %$* 9
netanhayu were here tonight, how would you assure him that he can maintain his confidence in the united states. %$* 9
thank you, nick burns. %$* 13
i’m glad you raised the issue, because we do have to talk about israel here, i think one of the basic problems that the united states should have with iran, is the threats that ahmadinejad has made against the israeli state and the existence of the israeli people. %$* 399
and it should be a vital national priority, and it is, for the united states to safeguard israel, and protect it. %$* 399
and that’s one of our key strategic interests here, how do we best do that. %$* 399
i fear that if we, if the israelis launched airstrikes, or if we did, in the next couple of months, we wouldn’t have ever tested the proposition that maybe diplomacy and sanctions backed up by the use of force could work. %$* 399
and we get ourselves into a position where, we’d have the unintended consequences of war, we found out about that in iraq. %$* 399
we’d have the ability of iran to use hezbollah and hammas asymmetrically to attack israel, to attack the moderate palestinians and american interests. %$* 399
and, i’m not aware of a convincing scenario where the use of force actually works. %$* 399
and so, i would just say very respectfully to prime minister netanyahu and he has a right to raise this issue-- %$* 399
he should raise this issue-- %$* 399
that the united states should make a commitment to israel that we will safeguard its security. %$* 399
they should allow president obama, in my judgment, working very closely with israel, to take the lead, for as long as we think that this diplomatic path can be successful. %$* 399
there may come a time, when we wanna end diplomacy— %$* 399
dan— %$* 13
—and go to a tougher option. %$* 399
dan senor. %$* 13
i would just, i’d put prime minister netanyahu in the same category that i put all of the regional players, or at least many of them. %$* 142
which they are deeply concerned about the mixed signals we’re getting from this administration. %$* 142
prime minister netanyahu’s saying what he’s saying because he is concerned that the administration is not backing up their diplomatic plan with a credible military threat to solve this problem if it doesn’t go anywhere. %$* 142
that is the same thing that is going on throughout the persian gulf and the arab world, and i take your point, your earlier point, ken, that it’s very difficult to sort of read exactly what is going on in each one of these arab societies, but, just the fact that secretary gates as liz said earlier had to travel to cairo and riyadh to reassure them, don’t worry, we’re not gonna make this open- ended, and the fact that dennis ross has had to bounce around all these capitols to say, don’t misread what we’re try—you know, we’re trying to talk but it’s not gonna— i mean, it gets to a point here where these people are voting, whether it’s netanyahu or the king of jordan or the king of saudi arabia, or, or the president of egypt, there is deep concern in the region, and this is a profoundly violent and volatile neighborhood we’re talking about, where wars often start because of misunderstandings and miscommunications and mixed signals, and violent revolutions. %$* 142
and we are dealing with a region right now, which i believe because of the current administration’s lack of clarity about how they intend to back up this diplomatic process, if the iranians actually ever enter into it, is potential for a very dangerous situation. %$* 142
sir, your question? %$* 13
for clarification on what you mean. %$* 9
the arguers against the motion, suggest that speaking with russia and china would be part of diplomacy. %$* 9
whereas the arguers for the motion, i don’t think they would—they’re thinking of that kind of diplomacy. %$* 9
as i understand the question, is whether we should negotiate or seek diplomacy, with iran. %$* 9
or should just tell iran to get lost, but, that still reserves the opportunity to talk with russia and china and try to agree on a sanction. %$* 9
so i’d like you each to define by what you mean by diplomacy, if you’re talking with china and russia, who do you vote for in this debate. %$* 9
i think we actually, probably all four agree that successful diplomacy cannot be bilateral. %$* 230
now, i don’t %$* 230
i probably shouldn’t speak for my opponents here but successful diplomacy has got to include countries like russia and china who actually have relationships with iran that they could use, they’ve got leverage with iran that they could use were they to choose to use it. %$* 230
i think the difference between us, there are two differences between us, one is, i would say, you know, all right, let’s accept for the sake of argument that we can work with russia and china to try to put tough sanctions in place against the iranians. %$* 230
there’s no evidence right now that there’s any intent on the part of either russia or china, to put tough sanctions in place against the iranians, that piece of this diplomacy is going nowhere. %$* 230
and, i think the second difference is, you know, this question of how much hope do you hold out, after years and years and years, and, you know, lavrov said to us, you know, within the last six weeks, i don’t wanna have tougher sanctions on the iranians, i mean we ran into this problem consistently. %$* 230
at the end of the day, the only thing that will get the russians and the chinese and some of the other, some of the europeans onboard with this is if they believe, if they don’t sign up for crippling sanctions the united states will use force. %$* 230
and right now they don’t believe that. %$* 230
ken pollack. %$* 13
you may have all noticed, we’re kind of competitive people, all of us, up here on this panel. %$* 400
and we’re actually all friends too. %$* 400
please don’t let the competitiveness drown that out. %$* 400
and i wanna ask this question, not to score debating points, ‘cause i think that there is something really interesting going on here and i’ve just been kind of reflecting on it. %$* 400
and this question really kind of brought it to the fore for me and it goes back to the question i raised before but— i wanna put it in a neutral fashion, i don’t want it to be a debating point. %$* 400
but i do wanna ask this question, because you know, although i am the only democrat on the panel, i am not speaking for the obama administration. %$* 400
and as dan and liz and i know, i am very glad to disagree with my own party, very publicly, whenever i think it’s necessary. %$* 400
but the question i would like to ask is, what is it that you feel we’re not doing that we should be doing. %$* 400
that would make—‘cause again, i think i’d probably sign up for it, and i just—i wanna hear it. %$* 400
dan, i can give you 20 seconds— %$* 13
20 seconds— %$* 142
—to answer that question— %$* 13
—okay, i’ll be real quick, but i do wanna commend ken for taking on his own party from time to time which he’s done on some pretty big issues so i— %$* 142
that was a waste of four seconds— %$* 13
second—i know. %$* 142
with my— with the balance of my 16, i will say, if you believe there is a discussion going on right now within the iranian government between confrontationalists, those who believe that we just need to plow—or the iranians need to plow ahead and build their nuclear bomb and be quite confrontational, and those that are reformers that believe that, we can cut a deal, the iranians can cut a deal with the west %$* 142
we clearly wanna strengthen their hand. %$* 142
and what better way to strengthen their hand than when they’re going into those discussions with the hard- liners than to say, if we don’t act now, while employment is 25 to 30 percent, while our economy’s falling apart, 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old, we could have a revolt here %$* 142
if the americans move forward with truly crippling economic sanctions, or potentially military force, this regime will collapse and we will have a total mess on our hands. %$* 142
that is the kind of leverage we wanna give the reformers in their internal debates with the hard-liners. %$* 142
to say the americans are lea—left this thing open- ended, they’re having a discussion, we haven’t even returned their phone calls, this is great, the hard-liners aren’t gonna be terribly persuaded that they should, they should be responsive. %$* 142
that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
so we’re now in the final stretch and soon you in the audience will be choosing the winner, recall that, at the start of the debate we asked you whether you took sides with or against this motion, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere.” before the debate, it was an even split among the choices, 34 percent of you are for the motion, 33 percent are against, and 33 percent are undecided. %$* 13
and soon we will have you vote one last time, but we are going to go now to our third and final round, each debater is given a brief amount of time, two minutes each, to make a closing statement %$* 13
and we will begin against the motion, ambassador nicholas burns, former under- secretary of state for political affairs. %$* 13
thank you, this has been a terrific debate, and i’ve enjoyed it very much, i like where dan left off. %$* 399
the way to get serious draconian sanctions, the only way in my experience and my judgment, is to continue this diplomatic process. %$* 399
is not to give up on it. %$* 399
is to bring the russians and chinese and japanese and arab countries in, the major trading partners, and to convince them to go along with us. %$* 399
i think we face a real threat in iran. %$* 399
and we should be very tough-minded and very serious in facing it as americans. %$* 399
and we should not leave military force out of this. %$* 399
we should leave that on the table. %$* 399
we should have a threat of sanctions hanging over the iranians’ heads. %$* 399
but if we give up now, i’m afraid we’ll never know the answer to the question, was peace possible. %$* 399
did we have the patience and ingenuity and the courage to believe in ourselves, to believe in our ability to be successful at the—at the diplomatic table. %$* 399
i think we should lead with diplomacy, with the military in reverse. %$* 399
i’m afraid that if we agree with liz and dan’s position, we’re really leading with the military, and we’re forsaking diplomacy. %$* 399
president obama has just begun his administration. %$* 399
he’s just begun this diplomatic process, which is gonna be quite complex, it’s not gonna go on forever. %$* 399
he needs to be given time, and we need to have the patience as citizens, to let diplomacy play itself out, not forever. %$* 399
but for—and i think everybody can agree on this. %$* 399
for several months’ time, to test the proposition, that we might find peace, and not find war, i think frankly, that if we just tried war now, and gave up on diplomacy, and either emboldened the israelis to strike, or struck ourselves, which is the logical conclusion of this position of our opponents, i think it would be unconscionable of us, to go to war, to start a third war, without having given diplomacy a chance. %$* 399
that’s our position, i hope you’ll agree with it. %$* 399
thank you, nick burns, and summarizing for the motion, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere,” liz cheney, former state department official overseeing mideast policy. %$* 13
i would venture a guess that i’m somewhere to the right of many people in the audience tonight with one or two notable exceptions. %$* 230
but you don’t have to be as hawkish as i am on this issue to realize that our current diplomatic track with iran is in fact going nowhere. %$* 230
you really only have to agree with the testimony that nick gave before the senate foreign relations committee last week. %$* 230
in his testimony nick very helpfully laid out steps that the obama administration must take in order for diplomacy to go somewhere. %$* 230
he said, force must be on the table, president obama needs to prevail upon iran to freeze its nuclear research as the talks proceed so iran does not steam ahead unimpeded. %$* 230
president obama should set a timetable, and finally nick said, excuse me, that it’ll be crucial that the president agree on the automaticity of sanctions with the p-5 countries, especially russia and china in advance of the talks. %$* 230
now i think we probably disagree on whether these steps alone are tough enough to convince the iranians to give up their weapons. %$* 230
but it is indisputable, that any of these steps are part of our current diplomacy. %$* 230
therefore, as we debate the issue tonight and as you cast you vote, i would say don’t be swayed by nick’s division of, you know, vote for them and you’re voting for war and vote for us and you’re voting for peace. %$* 230
what we’re arguing is that the current diplomacy is ineffective, is going nowhere, because, by nick’s own definition, it does not include the steps that it needs to include to make diplomacy effective. %$* 230
thank you. %$* 230
thank you, liz cheney. %$* 13
and, summarizing against the motion, that “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere,” kenneth pollack, senior fellow and director of research at the saban center for middle east policy at the brookings institution. %$* 13
i think there are two interesting things that are going on right here, in some ways we’re having two separate debates. %$* 400
on the one hand, i’m really heartened by what we’ve all agreed to over the course of the last hour and a half. %$* 400
i’m really struck by the fact that we all do believe that tough-minded diplomacy really is what this is all about. %$* 400
and, liz, while it may be useful in trying to win this debate, i would suggest to you that i—you and i both know nick pretty well, he’s not contradicting what he said before the senate. %$* 400
he still believes it, he hasn’t changed his mind over the weekend. %$* 400
and what we’re saying is effectively the same thing. %$* 400
and so on the one hand, i think that the differences between us may be a matter of semantics, as i suggested it might be a matter of months. %$* 400
and i think that’s actually really remarkable. %$* 400
and it’s something worth taking away from this. %$* 400
is that we all are pretty close on this, and what we’re defining as what the right policy is is actually pretty close. %$* 400
at another level though of course, the question as opposed i think raises a very different set of propositions in people’s minds. %$* 400
and that’s what nick was trying to get at just a minute ago and i think that it is important to think about. %$* 400
because while i think that liz and dan have been very good about saying, look, we’re not talking about going to war, rushing to war or jumping right into these things, and we want to give diplomacy a chance, it’s just, doing some things differently and, we would come back and say, you know, look, the obama people have just started, it’s not clear that these things aren’t part of what they’re doing, in fact there’s a lot of evidence to suggest it will be, i mean let’s remember, hillary clinton did talk about crippling sanctions against iran, which was a very important point. %$* 400
but at the end of the day there are a lot of other people out there who aren’t on this panel, who will say, look at that sentence and say, you’re right, time to go to war. %$* 400
or time to go to regime change, or something else. %$* 400
and i think that’s what we have to be concerned with. %$* 400
and those people don’t seem to be represented on this panel. %$* 400
and as far as i’m concerned on the wider debate, the one that isn’t gonna be scored tonight in the us public, that’s the debate that we really have to focus on. %$* 400
because diplomacy is the right way to handle things, it is the right way to start. %$* 400
if we don’t start there, we’re never gonna end up anywhere that we wanna be. %$* 400
thank you, ken pollack. %$* 13
and, finally summarizing for the motion, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere,” dan senor, senior fellow at the council on foreign relations. %$* 13
i would just close with a couple of quick points. %$* 142
one is a quote that i’ll read that characterized the iranian leadership in march of 2007. “president achmadinejad is reckless, he’s irresponsible, and he’s inattentive to the daily needs of the iranian people.” that was not liz cheney, that was not dan senor, that was then-senator obama, in a speech in chicago, on march 2nd of 2007. that characterization is probably accurate, and is probably consistent with the history that liz laid out in her opening. %$* 142
we don’t know exactly what will push the buttons of the iranian people, none of us truly know what will push the buttons of the iranian regime. %$* 142
it is such an opaque society, i went through this with iraq when there were many experts on all sides of the ideological spectrum who had very strong views about how the shiites would respond to this and the sunnis would respond to this and the kurds would— and, you know, some of them, all of them were— sometimes all of them were wrong and sometimes all of them were right, and as nick said earlier, when you’re dealing with a society, for three decades we’ve had no communication, no interactions, it is very hard to know what’s going on inside. %$* 142
so all we have to base this debate on is the history that we’re aware of, which liz went through in her opening statement. %$* 142
the actual public statements of the leadership of the country which should count for something, and the rhetoric they have used with regard to israel and the united states and the west is apocalyptic. %$* 142
and thirdly, their capabilities. %$* 142
the capability that they are trying to develop, right now, in defiance of un security council resolutions, and in defiance of our effort to reach out to them. %$* 142
that is a dangerous, toxic combination. %$* 142
their history of non-negotiation and stalling, combined with the public statements about what they would do, the genocidal rhetoric they, they articulate, that, they say they would use genocidal weapons for, and finally, the capability that they are trying to pursue. %$* 142
so— %$* 142
dan senor, i’m sorry, your time is up. %$* 13
a dip— %$* 142
i’ll give you 10 more seconds— %$* 13
a diplomatic process is fine, as long as we are clear and we can make clear to the iranians, where it ends, and how strongly we back up the alternative course in our negotiations. %$* 142
and that concludes round three of our debate, we will now have you pick our winner, recall that at the beginning of the debate, we were more evenly split than we have ever been at any of our debate series, 34 percent of you are for the motion coming in, 33 percent again, and 33 percent undecided, if you pick up your keypads, they are live now. %$* 13
vote 1 if you are for the motion, 2 if at this point you are against, and 3 if you remain undecided. %$* 13
we’re locking that out, and we are now just a couple of minutes away from declaring the winner, a couple of things we wanna make announcements about, given that this is the end of our third season, everyone at intelligence squared is very grateful to those of you who have continued to show support and enthusiasm for these debates. %$* 13
we also want to extend a warm thank you to the rockefeller university for the use of this auditorium, caspary auditorium, throughout the season. %$* 13
we want you to know that ticket packages and individual tickets for next season, fall 2009, and spring 2010 series are on sale now, right now, through our website. %$* 13
the fall debate dates and topics are these, on monday september 21st, the topic is “buy american/hire american policies will backfire.” on tuesday, october 6th, “pakistan, not afghanistan, is america’s real problem.” tuesday, october 27th, “good riddance to mainstream media.” tried to slip that %$* 13
monday, november 16th, “obama’s economic policies are working effectively” %$* 13
tuesday, december 1st, “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” all of our debates will continue to be heard on more than 185 npr stations across the country. %$* 13
and all five debates will now be covered by the bloomberg television network. %$* 13
to accommodate the television production and our growing audience we will be moving next season to a new venue downtown, we will be at the skirball center for the performing arts at nyu. and now more exciting news %$* 13
more exciting news. %$* 13
intelligence squared us, is very, very pleased to announce, a new partnership, a media partnership with newsweek magazine and here to help me with that is newsweek ceo tom ascheim. %$* 13
tom? %$* 13
john. %$* 401
i’m here to kill the time while we count the votes. %$* 401
that was really thrilling, thank you all very much, it was great entertainment and i think really a great exemplar of what we are looking forward to in partnering with intelligence squared. %$* 401
i’m sorry, i have dastardly allergies so you’re hearing me sound like a frog, i apologize. %$* 401
we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to really embed the content from these debates in both our magazine and our website going forward. %$* 401
they are on issues of incredible importance, not least the future of mainstream media i’d like to point out. %$* 401
when we were first introduced to intelligence squared it was very clear that we had an enormous amount in common, perhaps most pertinently that we both love to see a great fight started, and it makes for really good content for all of us. %$* 401
there’s really no better time for us to be having this partnership, intelligence squared is expanding, it’s gonna be great to see it downtown. %$* 401
and we are already launching the very fabric that is newsweek, on monday the magazine is being reborn in a new form and a new way, i hope you will all check it out as well as the website as well as the brand in general, so, we look forward to a great partnership— %$* 401
tom— %$* 1
bob, thank you very much. %$* 401
tom, thank you. %$* 1
right. %$* 401
thank you, tom. %$* 1
and now to declare the winner, you voted before the debate on whether you agree or disagree with our motion that “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere,” you have now voted again and here we go, before the debate, 34 percent of you were for the motion, 33 percent against, 33 percent were undecided, remember when i raise my hand i will need applause. %$* 13
here are the results, after the debate. %$* 13
35 percent are for the motion, 59 percent are now against the motion— 6 percent are undecided, congratulations to the side arguing against the motion, and of course to the art of persuasion itself, for me, john donvan, and intelligence squared, thank you. %$* 13

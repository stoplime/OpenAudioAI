we know what their arms were. %$* 439
and we knew that they were coming to attack afghans and americans and others. %$* 439
and we killed them before they could do that %$* 439
i want to let ahmed rashid respond to that. %$* 13
but first, i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
ahmed rashid, signature strikes? %$* 13
i just want to answer the question which the lady posed, which i think we should go back to. %$* 437
and i think you're absolutely right. %$* 437
for the admiral to describe the individuals who are involved in this decision making doesn't give us the criteria. %$* 437
i mean, what is the criteria for choosing who's going to live and who's going to die? %$* 437
the fact is the u.s.media itself has portrayed that, the president is sitting there ticking off on a list as to who is going to live and who is going to die, or today, who is going to be drone or not. %$* 437
now, i mean, we have no idea what the criteria is, how these people are chosen, what is the level of evidence about them being al-qaeda? %$* 437
now, i'm not asking for all this to be made public. %$* 437
but i think there must be much-- %$* 437
a much greater degree of satisfaction that people understand, why these targets are being chosen. %$* 437
and that is just not there at all. %$* 437
i agree. %$* 18
i agree. %$* 18
well, could i add, i mean, it became a live issue in the united states only when an american citizen was killed. %$* 438
so all my afghan and pakistani friends are like, well, you guys care when it's an american kid named awlaki that's killed, but not when our cousins and brothers are killed. %$* 438
awlaki was a self-declared combatant. %$* 440
the son of-- %$* 438
i mean the 16-year-old. %$* 438
and again, that still hasn't come out. %$* 438
but all i'm saying is that, again, the battle is a battle that involves them more than us. %$* 438
and it's a narrative that i think is really the challenge here. %$* 438
and i think in some ways we agree more than we disagree on who's winning and who's losing that narrative. %$* 438
so the adverb here is important, fatally. %$* 440
i'm going to take another question, right down in front here. %$* 13
folks, if you're upstairs and raising your hands, i apologize. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
number one, i can't see you. %$* 13
and we don't have mics up there. %$* 13
but if you are really enthusiastic and come down through the back doors, i'll find you. %$* 13
but if you do that, really make it a good question. %$* 13
hi. %$* 444
my name is john dagastino. %$* 444
this question is for the "for" side, particularly john. %$* 444
you've made the point several times talking about our allies’, quote, "indictment" of this policy. %$* 444
i presume by that you mean pakistan. %$* 444
how do you reconcile that indictment with their cooperation? %$* 444
and consequently, how much of that indictment is actually hypocrisy? %$* 444
well, yeah, i should have defined ally. %$* 438
i'm talking about the people that i dealt with on the ground. %$* 438
so whether they were in khost or in helmund or even in fallujah, although the drones weren't armed then, i'll let ahmed take the bigger issue of the pakistani maybe duplicity. %$* 438
and i'm sure there's a lot of double winks that go on every day of the week over there. %$* 438
but my concern is the allies that actually are the future leaders of afghanistan, the university students, the madrasa students, the tribal elders, the mullahs, the whole host of people that get killed in these drone strikes when they go wrong. %$* 438
because i don't think the taliban hold up a red flag. %$* 438
i know they don't, and say, "i'm taliban. %$* 438
what happens is there's a bad guy in the family or a bad guy in the village, and we identify maybe he's a bad guy, and we drop a hellfire, and then you turn three villages against us. %$* 438
it goes to the ratio and the equal sign. %$* 438
i'll come back to it. %$* 438
yes to the woman i thought who asked a very good question, elaborated on by you, our moderator, is the number of enemies we're making and the number of targets we're making. %$* 438
and i'll defer to you, ahmed, on the question about his point on as far as the pakistan government or the pakistan-- %$* 438
yeah, why don't you let ahmed get to that. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
can i just say one thing first? %$* 437
and that is that most allies of the u.s.in europe, are against drones. %$* 437
as far as i know, only the british have openly-- %$* 437
support the u.s.policy of drones. %$* 437
most of the europeans, european governments and european parliaments, are against it. %$* 437
and they've been-- %$* 437
what does it mean, "against it," that they want it to stop completely? %$* 13
sorry? %$* 437
they want a total cessation of the use of use of drones in that area? %$* 13
yes. %$* 437
i mean-- %$* 437
okay. %$* 13
just wanted to clarify. %$* 13
they do. %$* 437
or they want greater transparency, or they want greater information as to,-- %$* 437
but in other words, nobody in the world basically is backing the u.s.use of drones. %$* 437
and i think that's very-- %$* 437
that's a point that is often completely forgotten in-- %$* 437
the american media and-- %$* 437
let me ask your opponents, is that-- %$* 13
is that relevant? %$* 13
dennis blair? %$* 13
and i'll back to you, ahmed. %$* 13
well, i mean, what's your evidence, mr. %$* 439
rashid? %$* 439
no one in the world-- %$* 439
well, now we're counting everybody in the world. %$* 13
use of drones. %$* 439
i mean can you be a little more specific? %$* 439
well, you look at the-- %$* 437
can you give me resolutions by legislatures in other countries? %$* 439
can you give me-- %$* 439
well, with all due respect, i haven't heard a lot of, "rah, rah, drones." and i've been in the state department for 12 years. %$* 438
so i'll help my friend out here; that whether nato raises their arm and says, we approve the drone program, i know general dunford and his political adviser, carter malkasian have their hands full all the time on these issues. %$* 438
but is it a popular thing? %$* 438
i highly doubt that. %$* 438
i don't know any-- %$* 438
and it's not a popular thing in the united states. %$* 439
we don't like killing people, but we only do it when we have to. %$* 439
well, i'm not sure we only go when we have to. %$* 438
i think it's actually, i think, easier for the american people to think it's joystick warfare and send in seal team 6. and that's also another issue that we could get into. %$* 438
well, i would simply-- %$* 439
i would simply say that the drones are handled with the same care, concern, discrimination that the armed forces, the united states and other american agencies handle all other weapons, which they know can kill the innocent as well as the enemy. %$* 439
and drones are used with the same set of procedures. %$* 439
and i think their inherent characteristics allow them to be more on the side of killing those who they intend to kill with fewer others. %$* 439
dennis, but let me follow up on that and ask you this question. %$* 13
it came up a little bit before. %$* 13
sometimes in certain circumstances, some weapons seem to raise different moral or ethical challenges to their use. %$* 13
nuclear weapons, classic example. %$* 13
your opponents have used the word "sinister" about drones, that they're different somehow. %$* 13
you, i think, alluded to the fact that maybe presidents will be tempted to use drones a great deal more because u.s.casualties are lower, that there's always going to be a temptation for a president. %$* 13
what about this notion that there's a different, perhaps sinister quality to the weapon itself, because it's in a different category? %$* 13
i'll-- %$* 439
i mean, general schwartz was involved in it much more closely than i was. %$* 439
but i was pretty close to it. %$* 439
there is a novelty factor. %$* 439
anything that's new and long range and all is-- %$* 439
seems inherently more fascinating, sinister and interesting. %$* 439
we've seen that with new weapons over the generations as they come along. %$* 439
certainly, the sort of media discussion centers on drones. %$* 439
i mean, we're not having an intelligence squared debate about overall u.s.policy against al-qaeda. %$* 439
we're talking about drones. %$* 439
why? %$* 439
because it's sexy, and it's new, and it has a lot of %$* 439
yeah, but we would if there were chemical weapons. %$* 13
i mean, i'm not comparing them, but-- %$* 13
but, no, i think the media effect is important in this, john. %$* 439
yep, okay. %$* 13
i think novelty, media, it tends to give it that overwhelming force that mr. %$* 439
rashid has talked about. %$* 439
i think we have to get beyond that to what are the actual facts about what's going on on the battlefield. %$* 439
are we achieving our objectives? %$* 439
are we-- %$* 439
are we not? %$* 439
narrative, shhmarative. %$* 439
you know, it's are you getting to your objectives, which are to be able to defeat the taliban-- %$* 439
and protect americans. %$* 440
and protect americans, yeah. %$* 439
sir, right down here. %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
mic-- %$* 13
mic will come for you. %$* 13
my name is robert klein. %$* 445
we have to vote. %$* 445
and what i've heard from this side is that the use of drones is indiscriminate without a lot of substantiation in my view. %$* 445
and from this side i've heard incredible amounts of care and preparation and diligence before drones are launched. %$* 445
which is the more accurate of the two? %$* 445
because on the face of it, that would be the basis of our vote. %$* 445
mr. %$* 13
klein, there's always the undecided category. %$* 13
but it is their task to persuade you. %$* 13
it's a question of who's more credible. %$* 440
seriously, though, i take your point. %$* 440
based on the available numbers, again, i would go back to that, you can question long war journal, you can question the un studies and-- %$* 440
and so on, the new america foundation is another organization that monitors this. %$* 440
but the number-- %$* 440
from 2006 to the present time in afghanistan, the estimate is that drones have engaged and killed some 2600 al-qaeda and taliban combatants. %$* 440
out-- %$* 440
the same organization estimates 330 civilian casualties. %$* 440
now, once again, please don't take the-- %$* 440
that my view is that it doesn't matter. %$* 440
it matters a hell of a lot, and i think kael is-- %$* 440
and mr. %$* 440
rashid have made this point. %$* 440
it matters a lot, but you have to keep this in perspective, and the numbers are pretty clear, one to seven, one to five, you know, you can say that that's anecdotal, but it's the best we have. %$* 440
and my point is, is that i know what the kids do. %$* 440
and i would ask all the parents in here if your youngster as we were talking out in the reception earlier was on the ground, what would you prefer to have in the air, something that passes over in 30 seconds and goes away or something that is overhead constantly and provides surveillance and an ability to engage the enemy that might well keep that soldier, sailor, airman, marine safe? %$* 440
i know what my answer as a commander is. %$* 440
well, again-- %$* 438
kael weston. %$* 13
general, i get that point to an extent. %$* 438
i had lived five out of my seven years in these wars with marine grunts. %$* 438
surveillance overhead is a part of war. %$* 438
the issue is when the drones strike, what the net effect is. %$* 438
in province on the border with pakistan i can tell you when those one to five, one to seven-- %$* 438
i think numbers to me is not an issue i like to get into because it's that equals sign. %$* 438
which is how many family members, tribal members, community members are affected by one loss of life? %$* 438
the ied strikes are where most of our guys are losing their legs. %$* 438
so do the ieds go up when an operation like that goes wrong, and you've got a cousin in miranshah, you've got brothers in miranshah, and you live in khost? %$* 438
i would argue with all due respect that the odds of getting a marine or a soldier's legs blown off go up because of this program, not go down. %$* 438
okay, that's your view. %$* 440
my view-- %$* 440
yes. %$* 438
is killing bomb makers makes the numbers go down. %$* 440
fair enough, it's two sides of a-- %$* 438
in the center, there. %$* 13
and the mike will come down-- %$* 13
up the aisle. %$* 13
it's coming from your left hand side now. %$* 13
if you can state your name, please. %$* 13
my name is peter burgess i was in afghanistan just after the soviets withdrew so, you know, i have a bit of a feeling for the neighborhood. %$* 446
the question is, is the drone program fatally flawed or some words to that effect, and-- %$* 446
that's exactly it. %$* 13
peter burgess-- %$* 13
we used to talk about nation building. %$* 13
we used to talk about not having failed states. %$* 13
can somebody please explain to me how a drone addresses the issue of nation building and stopping failed states? %$* 13
i think it's not intended to though, is it or-- %$* 13
it’s intended to kill taliban so that they don't keep the nation builders from going and doing their job. %$* 439
i think you're going to be our last question, and i've been saving you because you have had the most vigorous arm waving of anyone tonight. %$* 13
it worked. %$* 18
my question is for the side arguing against the motion, does the fact that the drone program cuts down on american armed forces casualties, does that enable the u.s. to engage in more reckless conflicts around the world? %$* 18
it-- %$* 440
look, i mean, this is-- %$* 440
norton schwartz. %$* 13
this is the fundamental question. %$* 440
remember, that is not a military call. %$* 440
that is a call for civilian leadership, where we go and what we do. %$* 440
and there is an argument that fewer american casualties might encourage political leadership to be more aggressive or more reckless. %$* 440
there is that potential, but that's what best military advice is all about. %$* 440
remember, we have a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who is the president's principal military advisor. %$* 440
and if you've watched mike mullen, or marty dempsey, or in his day denny blair, offer military advice, it's not to encourage political leadership to be reckless. %$* 440
ultimately, we salute, but the key thing here is that, that is a legitimate concern, but it is one that the military, the uniforms feel personally. %$* 440
and i'd say, if you see a political candidate who thinks a few american casualties are okay, but a lot or not, i wouldn't vote for him. %$* 439
ahmed rashid, when you say that it's already becoming a strategy as opposed to a tactic, do you think that dynamic is already in play, that presidents are authorizing these strikes, in part, because they can, without a cost back home? %$* 13
yes. %$* 437
i think so-- %$* 437
i think that's very true. %$* 437
and i fear very much that given the turmoil going on now in the middle east and other parts of the world, the reluctance of the americans and the europeans to want to get involved in by putting troops, or peacekeepers, or anything on the ground-- %$* 437
we're going to get more and more of this, that we throw technology at the problem. %$* 437
we throw drones at the problem. %$* 437
and that, i think, is going to be a very, very dangerous world to live in, frankly. %$* 437
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
and remember, you voted just before the debate. %$* 13
and right after this very brief section-- %$* 13
two-minute closing statements by each debater in turn-- %$* 13
you'll get to vote again. %$* 13
so, onto round 3.round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
we'll do these from our seats, general. %$* 13
round 3 are closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against the motion, norton schwartz. %$* 13
he's former chief of staff of the u.s.air force. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, admiral norton schwartz. %$* 13
general norton schwartz. %$* 13
hi. %$* 440
denny wishes i was an admiral. %$* 440
some people in the air force would’ve, too. %$* 440
i don't know. %$* 440
let me just say that i think that our partners here in the debate tonight have expressed absolutely legitimate concerns. %$* 440
and while we've jousted a bit, it's been done with respect and an appreciation for their passion and their conviction on this issue. %$* 440
i'd just like to relate a quick vignette. %$* 440
in earlier days, when i was flying airplanes, i flew a gunship-- %$* 440
a c1-- %$* 440
it's a c-130 with guns on it. %$* 440
and there was one occasion when i remember the following call came from the ground. %$* 440
and it was this-- %$* 440
“troops in contact need help now.”when an airman hears-- %$* 440
no matter what service-- %$* 440
navy, army, marine corps, air force-- %$* 440
hears "troops in contact need help now," there is an immediate response. %$* 440
and it is visceral, but not necessarily as accurate or as coherent as you might like it to be if you were-- %$* 440
if you could have been there for hours prior, and will remain there for hours after, which is the case with the remote aircraft or the drone technology today. %$* 440
i would just conclude by saying that use of drones is neither sport nor a failed tactic. %$* 440
and you must vote against the proposition and the adverb "fatally." thank you. %$* 440
thank you, norton schwartz. %$* 13
our motion is the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
and here to argue-- %$* 13
here to share his closing statement in support of the motion, john kael weston. %$* 13
he is former state department advisor to marine units in iraq and afghanistan. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john kael weston. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 438
and i would echo what the general just said. %$* 438
i-- %$* 438
this is raising the level of debate and we should all be grateful for that. %$* 438
i've got two minutes and i'm going to run through these pretty quickly. %$* 438
i opened with a quiz about what words or nouns, adjectives you think they associate with the united states of america after 12 years of constant warfare. %$* 438
i don't have time to ask you what those words are, but occasionally i would hear words like apple-- %$* 438
they had the apple phone-- %$* 438
obama, money. %$* 438
but unfortunately, toward the top of that list was d for drones. %$* 438
it wasn't d for democracy. %$* 438
it actually, to be frank, wasn't the nation-building. %$* 438
it was the ct.it was the counter- terrorist platform. %$* 438
and i think we should think about that. %$* 438
do we want that to be kind of at the top of the list of what they think about us after 12 years, billions of dollars, thousands of americans killed, over 100,000 iraqis, et cetera, et cetera? %$* 438
the second point i'm going to now just cite to the question of what happened on may 1st, 2010? %$* 438
i think it was admiral blair who referenced this. %$* 438
and i'll add a little detail. %$* 438
it was faisal shahzad, who just a few blocks from here tried to blow up the blue 1993 nissan pathfinder. %$* 438
in that pathfinder was three 20-gallon propane tanks, a big green metal gun locker that contained a metal pressure cooker pot, 250 pounds of urea based fertilizer, and eight plastic bags with 120 m88s. %$* 438
the new york city police commissioner, ray kelly, said the bomb would have killed many. %$* 438
the police later on said it would have had shrapnel and probably killed mostly tourists but a number of people. %$* 438
what did faisal shahzad say? %$* 438
new yorkers get that. %$* 438
what did-- %$* 438
i used to ride my mountain bike through there, but i didn't go very often-- %$* 438
faisal shahad was asked by a judge what motivated him to try and blow up that nissan. %$* 438
here's what he said, "well, the drone hits in afghanistan and iraq," he said finally, "they don't see children. %$* 438
they don't see anybody. %$* 438
they kill women, children. %$* 438
they kill everybody. %$* 438
it's a war. %$* 438
and in war they kill people." one final point, boston marathon bombing, april 15, 2013, i don't have time to read what dzhokahar tsarnaev said, but basically he said the same thing, "we muslims are one body. %$* 438
you hurt one, you hurt us all. %$* 438
the u.s. government is killing our innocents." %$* 438
john kael weston, you're out of time. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." and here to summarize his position against the motion, dennis blair, former director of national intelligence. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, dennis blair. %$* 13
i've listened closely to our debaters on the other side. %$* 439
and there are an awful lot of anecdote and generalization there. %$* 439
let me tell a quick story from november 2011, a u.s.patrol that was on the eastern border of afghanistan, on pakistan, thought it was being fired on in the night, called for close support fire. %$* 439
a u.s.manned armed helicopter came up, under direction of these ground units fired at the units they thought were threatening them, and ended up killing 24 pakistani soldiers. %$* 439
things happen that are bad in war whether you have manned systems or unmanned systems. %$* 439
things happen that affect u.s.-pakistani relations whether you have manned systems or unmanned systems. %$* 439
this is the nature of combat and you have to make a balanced judgment about it. %$* 439
i do find it ironic to be on this side of the motion because as mr. %$* 439
weston said i was one of the first people who came out in public against some ways in which the drones were being used in pakistan well over two years ago. %$* 439
however, i was not against the technology itself. %$* 439
i was against the way it was being used at that time. %$* 439
i think we've adjusted since that time. %$* 439
i think that's the nature of this dynamic campaign against a group that's shown it's wanted to kill us, and has killed us in the past, and wants to kill us in the future. %$* 439
so i believe you have to vote against this motion. %$* 439
that doesn't mean that you like all of the drone program, doesn't mean you think it needs to be adjusted, changed, and the narrative needs to be improved, but i don't think we should take it out of the hands of those who are trying to defend the united states. %$* 439
thank you. %$* 439
thank you, dennis blair. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.s. drone program is fatally flawed," and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, our final speaker of the evening, ahmed rashid, a journalist and author of "pakistan on the brink." ladies and gentlemen, ahmed rashid. %$* 13
i would just hope that you would consider the long term implications of what drones mean-- %$* 437
will mean in the future for the united states, the day that your enemies get hold of drones and use drones against americans. %$* 437
the day that even your allies, that drones become a kind of free for all in this world. %$* 437
after all, the whole crisis that we are facing today over syria is that the danger of chemical weapons becoming a free for all. %$* 437
because so many rogue states hold chemical weapons, and if you allow this one to get away then others can follow suit quite easily. %$* 437
and the other thing i'd really like to mention here is that the use of drones has immensely complicated america's relations with its allies. %$* 437
you look at the situation in three countries where drone bases have been set up secretly, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. %$* 437
the u.s.set up drone bases with the help of the local regime, which were invariably dictatorships of one kind or another. %$* 437
they lied to their own people, these governments. %$* 437
they lied and said, "no, no, there's no such thing as u.s.bases here. %$* 437
there're no drone bases here at all. %$* 437
these are-- %$* 437
people are being killed by artillery shells, or by bombing, or something else. %$* 437
and what happened was that the public became more and more anti-regime and anti-american, which led to political crises in certainly two of these three countries. %$* 437
and it could well still lead to a political crisis in saudi arabia. %$* 437
so, you have now such a complicated scenario operating, where drones are creating-- %$* 437
i mean, one weapon, one weapon, and the use of this weapon is delegitimizing regimes in the region and also creating immense hatred for the united states. %$* 437
now, this is just one aspect of what i see as a future fraught with immense problems related to drones, which we are not even beginning to think about and i-- %$* 437
ahmed rashid, i'm sorry. %$* 13
that-- %$* 13
at that point, particularly, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 437
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side you feel argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to have you go to the keypads at your seats again and vote a second time. %$* 13
and i'll remind you that it's the team whose numbers move from the first vote to the second vote most in percentage point terms who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
push #1 if you agree with this statement as argued by this side: the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
push #2 if you disagree with that statement, you agree with the arguments made by this side. %$* 13
that's #2.and if you're undecided, became undecided or remain undecided, push #3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and we'll lock it out in about 15 seconds. %$* 13
and we'll have the results in about 90 seconds. %$* 13
and while we're doing that, one thing i want to do-- %$* 13
i felt that this debate tonight had a-- %$* 13
an emotional undertone to it. %$* 13
these are very, very passionate issues and difficult ones. %$* 13
and yet, the level of the debate was remarkably civil and informed and respectable, so i want congratulate all of our debaters-- %$* 13
for bringing that. %$* 13
and i also-- %$* 13
i'd also like to thank everybody who got up to ask a question. %$* 13
they were all good questions tonight, so thank you for that. %$* 13
and nobody debated the debaters, and that was even better. %$* 13
so thank you to all of you-- %$* 13
all of-- %$* 13
i want to point out that tonight, the president is giving a speech in 32 minutes. %$* 13
he's laying out the case for military action in syria following this suggestion put forward by the russians, to have international monitors go in and lock down the chemical weapons. %$* 13
it's only a month ago, actually, that intelligence squared was in aspen. %$* 13
and we debated the following motion: the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
so in light of that speech, i thought you would like to hear what the results of that debate were. %$* 13
again, the motion was the u.s.has no dog in the fight in syria. %$* 13
at the end of the debate, 61% of the live audience in aspen was in support of that motion. %$* 13
and that was a gain for them of 21 percentage points. %$* 13
33 percent were against. %$* 13
so, they only picked up three percentage points. %$* 13
so, that was a clear win for the side that was voting to keep america out of this fight. %$* 13
as it happens, one of those winning debaters is with us tonight-- %$* 13
richard falkenrath. %$* 13
i just want to ask you to take a little bow. %$* 13
he was dying to ask a question tonight, but you're a stage guy, not an audience guy. %$* 13
i'd like to also just ask-- %$* 13
remind you about tweeting about the debate. %$* 13

so we have the final vote results. %$* 13
remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms before the debate and after the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is this, "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed." the vote went this way before the motion, 23 percent agreed that the program is flawed, 34 percent were against, 43 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
remember, now, this change in votes. %$* 13
the second vote, "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 23 percent. %$* 13
they gained zero. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, their first vote was 34 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 64 percent. %$* 13
that's a gain of 30 percentage points. %$* 13
the motion "the u.s.drone program is fatally flawed" has been defeated. %$* 13
our congratulations to that team. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

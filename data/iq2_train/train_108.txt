and i want to tell you a couple of stories. %$* 340
in october of 1994 the government put up this wall, called operation gatekeeper. %$* 340
and it’s been estimated by the flyer that i have in the back that four thousand five hundred people have died in the last thirteen years. %$* 340
and that’s an estimate, according to the border patrol. %$* 340
but i think the number is closer to ten thousand people. %$* 340
it, whether it’s four thousand, five hundred or ten thousand, people should not be dying because they’re coming here for a better opportunity. %$* 340
lucretia dominguez was one of those people. %$* 340
she crossed with two of her children, jesus and nora. %$* 340
jesus, a fifteen year old little boy and nora, a seven year old little girl. %$* 340
she crossed from sonora to arizona. %$* 340
and she crossed the only way she could because poor people cannot get visas. %$* 340
so when people tell you, why don’t they just get in line? %$* 340
– what line? %$* 340
there is no line. %$* 340
so she crossed. %$* 340
she crossed with an unethical smuggler, like many of them are – and we’re opposed to that, of course – and a group of migrants. %$* 340
and what happened was, they ran out of water. %$* 340
the smugglers said, "you’re slowing us down. %$* 340
you gotta cross on your own %$* 340
" they left, she left her behind with two of her children. %$* 340
she literally died in the arms of jesus, her fifteen year old son. %$* 340
and her sister, his sister nora was watching this. %$* 340
two children in the middle of the desert were wandering around with their dead mother there. %$* 340
thank god the border patrol found them and sent them back to mexico. %$* 340
their grandfather, cesario, who is from zacatecas, says, i don’t want to leave my daughter out there. %$* 340
so he went out looking for his daughter. %$* 340
he found one body, another body, another body before he found the body of his daughter. %$* 340
so if cesario can find three other bodies, how many bodies are out there? %$* 340
we think it’s approximately ten thousand people that have died. %$* 340
not only men, but also children. %$* 340
marco antonio viasenor – he died. %$* 340
he was a five year old little boy. %$* 340
and when he ran out of water he asked his dad for water. %$* 340
but his dad didn’t answer him. %$* 340
so he asked seventeen other men. %$* 340
they didn’t answer him. %$* 340
cause all eighteen men had died, including marco antonio viasenor, in the back in the back of a semi-truck in victoria, texas. %$* 340
this is the real story of what’s happening right now. %$* 340
it’s inhumane and we can do better than that as a people. %$* 340
we are a great people and we are a great nation. %$* 340
there’s a lot of myths and mis %$* 340
misinformation that’s out there. %$* 340
and we’ve heard some hateful terms, even in the discussion today-- %$* 340
sucking in, homegirl. %$* 340
this type of terminology to dehumanize people is unacceptable. %$* 340
jose luis cisneros was attacked by three american kids – a hate crime, which is at an all time high right now in the united states. %$* 340
we see the vigilante groups, like the minute men, which president bush has called vigilante, uh, hate groups. %$* 340
today is like yesterday. %$* 340
second and third generation immigrants and half of them are not from mexico. %$* 340
it was referred to mexican immigrants. %$* 340
half of the undocumented people are not from mexico. %$* 340
they come from other parts of the world for economic opportunity. %$* 340
they assimilate. %$* 340
they learn the language, just like your, like you did in, in the, in the many years that you’ve been here. %$* 340
there was a man that said, they’re not learning the language, they’re not assimilating. %$* 340
they want to just practice their own culture. %$* 340
we gotta stop them. %$* 340
arnold schwarzenegger’s in that category. %$* 340
maybe we should have sent him back. %$* 340
but then there’s eight million other people that cannot get a visa. %$* 340
these are poor people looking for a better economic opportunity and they’re sacrificing everything coming across the border. %$* 340
ninety percent of them come for economic reasons, ten percent come from fam %$* 340
for family reunification. %$* 340
they already have a relative living here. %$* 340
as dan mentioned, it’s an economic plus, the undocumented people in this country. %$* 340
they’ll tell you that schools and hospitals are closing. %$* 340
they are. %$* 340
we need health care reform, we need educational reform. %$* 340
but don’t blame the migrants. %$* 340
it’s easy to blame the most vulnerable sector of society. %$* 340
four percent of the world’s population lives in the united states-- %$* 340
three hundred million people – yet we consume over twenty percent of the world’s natural resources, fifty percent of the world’s illegal drugs. %$* 340
we have thirty percent – %$* 340
of the world’s population, uh, uh, environmental damage is caused by american companies. %$* 340
we could do better than that. %$* 340
crime, the department of justice issued a study in which undocumented people are less prone to commit crime and less violent. %$* 340
criminals are lazy people. %$* 340
why are they going to cross a border to commit crime? %$* 340
it’s legal versus illegal. %$* 340
if we use that premise all the time we would still have slavery, women could not vote, we’d still have children working in factories. %$* 340
we need to build bridges of communication and triple fences of su %$* 340
of separation. %$* 340
what good is it if we gain the whole world but lose our souls? %$* 340
there’s three and a half million people that have marched for immigration reform. %$* 340
your grandchildren are going to ask you one day, what did you do when they were raiding families at three in the morning, when, when two people were dying every day crossing the border? %$* 340
the whole world is watching. %$* 340
do the right thing. %$* 340
we need humane and comprehensive immigration reform. %$* 340
we’re a better country than that. %$* 340
we’re a better people than that. %$* 340
and it’s important that we practice what we preach. %$* 340
we should love our neighbor. %$* 340
and we were, when we were told to love our neighbor i’m sure it didn’t mean to kill ‘em. %$* 340
thank you all and god bless you. %$* 340

enrique morones, speaking against the resolution, enrique morones. %$* 135
if you have questions pass them to the aisle at the end of the row where you are so that we can make sure that we have plenty of questions for the question and answer period. %$* 135
our next speaker is speaking for the resolution, mark krikorian. %$* 135
apparently i’m here to argue that we should not love our neighbor. %$* 341
but that won’t be the substance of my talk. %$* 341
uh, the other side is claiming that, uh, the flow of people into the united states is inevitable, that it’s like the tides or continental drift and that we need to lie back and pretend to enjoy it. %$* 341
the fact, though, is that there’s nothing inevitable about, uh, the flow of people from abroad. %$* 341
it’s an artifact of government policy. %$* 341
the analogy they often use is to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit on an interstate and that it’s unnatural and therefore it has, that’s why people are violating the, uh, speed limit. %$* 341
the fact, though, is that an interstate highway is engineered for a particular speed. %$* 341
it’s designed for seventy mile an hour traffic-- %$* 341
the, uh, angles, the sightlines, the width of the shoulders. %$* 341
no economy, our economy is not engineered for any particular level of immigration. %$* 341
it can adapt to high levels of immigration, even higher than we have now. %$* 341
it can adapt to dramatically lower levels of immigration. %$* 341
the question is, what are the side effects, what are the consequences, what level of immigration do we want? %$* 341
through our elected representatives we’ve made a decision – incoherent sometimes as it is – about what our legal immigration policy should be. %$* 341
given what our legal immigration policy is it needs to be enforced, whatever it happens to be. %$* 341
if it’s changed, if the numbers are increased, decreased, what have you, the, the law needs to be enforced if it’s to mean anything. %$* 341
and there’s two ways you enforce immigration law. %$* 341
one is the conventional method of arresting and detaining and deporting people. %$* 341
we do that. %$* 341
we don’t really frankly do as much of that as, uh, you might think, but we do some of that and we need to do more of it. %$* 341
but at least as important, if not more important, is the other element of enforcement of any laws-- %$* 341
but specifically in immigration laws-- %$* 341
is to deter lawbreaking, to dissuade those abroad from sneaking in or overstaying their visas and to encourage, especially the more recent illegal immigrants, to leave and go home. %$* 341
um, and the welcome that we have, in fact, extended and been extending to illegal immigrants for many years now, uh, it subverts that second element of law enforcement. %$* 341
so what that means is we have two choices-- %$* 341
either focus even more on rounding up, arresting, detaining and deporting people, leaving that as our sole approach to enforce immigration law – or just give up enforcing immigration law and have de facto open borders – which, despite all the disclaimers, is what the other side wants. %$* 341
now, um, just enforcing immigration law in the conventional way – border patrol agents, uh, immi %$* 341
uh, immigration agents inside the country raiding work places and homes – relying only on that kind of enforcement can’t work. %$* 341
uh, we haven’t actually done all that much of it, uh, but however much we increase it, it can’t be the sole basis of our immigration enforcement approach. %$* 341
we need to have, uh, deterrence and what you might call encouraging voluntary compliance. %$* 341
after all, the irs doesn’t arrest everybody. %$* 341
it doesn’t, it isn’t in everybody’s, uh, accountant’s office, making sure the rule, the, the forms are filled out properly. %$* 341
uh, a few people are made examples of, and everyone else - most everyone else, uh, in our country remarkably compared to most places - complies with the law more or less, voluntarily. %$* 341
and so, what is it that we are doing? %$* 341
what is this “welcome” that we are talking about? %$* 341
what does it consist of? %$* 341
what are we doing to essentially subvert enforcement of our own immigration laws? %$* 341
some of these things you have already, um, you are familiar with, of course. %$* 341
uh, mr. %$* 341
rosenkranz referred to, uh, governor spitzer’s rule on driver’s licenses. %$* 341
uh, the driver’s license is, in fact, our national id system. %$* 341
and anything that makes it easy for illegal immigrants to get licenses, means it makes it easy for them to live here and to embed themselves in our society. %$* 341
jobs. %$* 341
in 19 %$* 341
it was only in 1986 that the employment of illegal immigrants was prohibited by law. %$* 341
before that, it was explicitly permitted in something called, not coincidentally, the texas proviso, where employers were held, uh, unaccountable for employing illegal immigrants. %$* 341
we did change it in 1986.but contrary to dan’s claims, we have done nothing to enforce it in the past 20 years. %$* 341
nothing. %$* 341
bupkis. %$* 341
we have gone through sort of, uh, cabooky efforts at finding a few people, as heather mentioned. %$* 341
uh, in 2003 was the low point of enforcement. %$* 341
and three employers, in the entire united states, were fined for knowing employment of illegal immigrants. %$* 341
we don’t even do basic things like tell employers, that they have submitted a fake or stolen social security number, uh, from an illegal immigrant employer %$* 341
uh, employee. %$* 341
and that matters, because the majority of illegal immigrants work on the books. %$* 341
they actually gave their employers a fake or a stolen social security number. %$* 341
we don’t even tell employers and hold them accountable for making sure that that information is correct. %$* 341
another example of the “welcome” we extend immigrants is, uh, bank accounts. %$* 341
the treasury department, just a couple of years ago %$* 341
told banks inexplicitly, in writing %$* 341
that it was ok for them to give bank accounts to illegal immigrants using, um, the mexican government’s illegal alien id card. %$* 341
that that was explicitly permitted by the law, and they shouldn’t, uh, be dissuaded from doing that. %$* 341
um, another example. %$* 341
in-state tuition. %$* 341
now, there is not that many illegal aliens going to state universities and getting, uh, in-state tuition subsidies. %$* 341
but symbolically, it’s very important. %$* 341
it is another part of the “welcome” that we extend illegal immigrants, which subverts our efforts to make whatever our immigration policy is stick. %$* 341
what we really need in ending this “welcome” is to pursue what i’d like to call a “firewall” strategy. %$* 341
make it not just difficult to get in the country, which is something we need to do, but also make it hard to gain access to the important institutions of our society %$* 341
so that it becomes as difficult as possible to be an illegal immigrant. %$* 341
so you can’t get a driver’s license, you can’t get a job, etc. %$* 341
only in that way can we successful dissuade new illegal immigrants from sneaking into the country, and persuade some significant portion of those to leave. %$* 341
that’s %$* 341
i describe that as an “attrition” policy. %$* 341
in other words, not magically eliminating the illegal immigration problem, but causing the illegal immigrant population %$* 341
instead of growing every year, to start declining every year. %$* 341
it’s a realistic approach. %$* 341
it’s not a pipe dream. %$* 341
heather mentioned the pakistani illegal immigrants after 9/11. but, um, the new york times and the usa today just in the past couple of weeks have written about how the new, very modest but real, increases in immigration enforcement are in fact impelling significant numbers of people to get the message - that the party is over, and it’s time for them to go home. %$* 341
it works. %$* 341
our research shows we could reduce the illegal population by half in five years, through normal law enforcement methods - not tattoos, not machine guns, not landmines - normal law enforcement, consistently applied. %$* 341
and that’s the key. %$* 341
normal law enforcement, consistently applied. %$* 341
and not welcoming illegal immigrants with one hand, while we - in some instances - make it harder on the other hand. %$* 341
we need a consistent, unmixed message to illegal immigrants. %$* 341
and you’ll be surprised %$* 341
thank you. %$* 341
one. %$* 135
instead of growing every year, to start declining every year. %$* 341

speaking for the resolution, mark krikorian. %$* 135
and thank you very much, mark. %$* 135
thank you. %$* 341
our last speaker for this portion, speaking against the resolution, is karen narasaki. %$* 135
thanks. %$* 342
good evening. %$* 342
while superficially the topic tonight is about “undocumented immigration,” the debate taking place in this country is really a deeper one. %$* 342
and it’s about whether immigrants - legal or not - are bad for america. %$* 342
and if you listen closely to heather, it’s about whether latino immigrants specifically are in fact destroying the fabric of our culture. %$* 342
now, everybody here actually on stage agrees on one thing, and that is our current immigration system is broken. %$* 342
what we disagree about is what is broken about it, and how best to fix it. %$* 342
if you vote for us, it’s because you share our belief, that immigrants are in fact integral to who we are as america, and that they and their children are integral to the betterment and future of our country. %$* 342
indeed, our core values as a nation are constantly renewed by immigrants, who come here seeking freedom and fairness, and opportunity for themselves and their families. %$* 342
the vibrancy and boldness of the youthful “can do” attitude, the spirit of america, is refreshed by immigrants who have the courage, the strength and initiative to leave their homes and their loved ones - and in many cases, uh, as enrique said - risk their lives to be part of the american dream. %$* 342
throughout our history, there have been people arguing that immigrants are “taking jobs and failing to assimilate.” that immigrants from certain religious, ethnic or racial backgrounds are “culturally unfit or unwilling to be americans.” that they bring “ignorance, poverty and disease, and threaten the dominance of english.” that’s what was said about the know nothings who argued about the italians, the irish, the germans, the jews, and even the asians in the last century. %$* 342
and that’s what’s being said by the restrictionists today. %$* 342
yet, in every case, immigrants and their children built businesses, they learned english, they joined the military - often in the face of discrimination against them, because of their religion or because of their race. %$* 342
current immigrants are learning english even faster than the past - and are helping to drive the creation of small businesses here in new york and around the country. %$* 342
and as we stand here debating tonight, immigrants and their sons and daughters are in afghanistan and iraq, defending american values. %$* 342
and i am talking about immigrants who are not even yet citizens. %$* 342
now, restrictionists have consistently been on the wrong side of history. %$* 342
and if you vote with them, it’s because - despite our long experience as a nation - you share their doubt about the power of american culture and american values. %$* 342
rather than dealing with their very discomforting dislocations - and they are scary, brought about by globalization and the new internet driven economy - it’s easier to blame immigrants and target them for their fears, as if, if they all went away, magically we wouldn’t have these new challenges. %$* 342
they hope to keep jobs in america by building high walls. %$* 342
and if we follow their old-school, isolationist prescription, america’s ability to generate jobs and compete in the global economy will fail. %$* 342
before computers and the internet maybe, and the globalization of corporations, it might have been possible to lock those jobs in. %$* 342
that’s no longer the case. %$* 342
even agra business, is moving across borders, with american companies buying farmland in mexico, because they can’t get the workers they need here in the u.s. and what about %$* 342
what does that mean in terms of our food security %$* 342
that we can no longer fully feed ourselves? %$* 342
vernon talked about “class.” well, it’s true that immigration challenges at all levels, actually. %$* 342
the american bar association magazine this month featured a story on the outsourcing of legal work to india. %$* 342
because the reality is today, with the internet, even if you keep immigrants out, it doesn’t mean that the jobs are staying here. %$* 342
all of us agree that a system which results in a huge number of undocumented %$* 342
undocumented immigrants who are extremely vulnerable to the exploitation that the professor talked about, is not good. %$* 342
because many restrictionists believe that immigrants are the root of these problems, their solutions tend to be reactionary policies that foster division, and actually backfire on communities and american citizens. %$* 342
i want to be clear. %$* 342
despite the back and forth, we are not arguing for open borders, and we are not arguing that our laws should not be enforced. %$* 342
what we are saying is let’s be smart. %$* 342
let’s talk about what laws need to change, so in fact they are enforceable and they make sense. %$* 342
laws only function when they are humane. %$* 342
and right now, our immigration laws are not humane, and they do not make sense. %$* 342
as dan said, we don’t provide a realistic number of visas or permanent green cards. %$* 342
the backlog for spouses and children to join with a legal permanent resident is now five to ten years. %$* 342
is that smart? %$* 342
that’s why we have so many undocumented immigration. %$* 342
how many people would wait ten years to be with their spouse or child? %$* 342
the backlog for high-tech workers to get a green card, once they have already proven their value to our economy, is now five to seven years. %$* 342
the number of visas available for temporary, low-skilled workers is 5,000 a year. %$* 342
now we could debate what the numbers should be. %$* 342
but i think most of you would find it strikingly unrealistic to say, that 5,000 is the right number. %$* 342
restrictionists talk about attrition through raids and hostile policies. %$* 342
and what they really mean is making our community so uncomfortable that people who - as was pointed out by mark - are finding much better wages here, are gonna be forced back across the border. %$* 342
we believe that it makes sense to reform the system to provide sufficient channels for legal entry, bring the current undocumented out of the shadows. %$* 342
nobody really believes we can get 12 million out. %$* 342
and more vigorously enforce existing anti-discrimination, wage and hour, health and safety laws in the workplace. %$* 342
the restrictionists don’t talk about that. %$* 342
that is why undocumented get exploited. %$* 342
that’s why employers like to hire them. %$* 342
because we are not enforcing the wage and hour, and health and safety. %$* 342
ten years ago, there was one inspector of restaurants in new york for wage and hour. %$* 342
that is ridiculous. %$* 342
we can reduce incentives without punishing everybody. %$* 342
for example, what is going to happen now, bush %$* 342
the bush administration is going to now require employers to match their social security numbers. %$* 342
and if you don’t %$* 342
uh, if you have a “no match,” you have 30 days to clear it up. %$* 342
30 days? %$* 342
the inspector general of the social security administration says, “we have at least 17 million errors in the data.” there is only 12 million undocumented. %$* 342
so what does that mean? %$* 342
that means a lot of us %$* 342
are gonna get caught up in that system. %$* 342
so what we are saying is, let’s have reasonable laws. %$* 342
mark talks about “licenses.” well, we are not giving licenses to immigrants to help them. %$* 342
we are giving licenses because we would prefer that everybody driving on the road can get insurance and take the tests and know the rules of the road. %$* 342
by not providing them with licenses %$* 342
with driver’s license, we are only punishing everybody else who is on the road with them. %$* 342
at bottom, the question is - do we really want to be the kind of community that refuses emergency health care to someone because they can’t produce a birth certificate or a green card? %$* 342
do we want to be the kind of community like riverside, new jersey, that found that their economic revival of their downtown was reversed overnight when they decided it was best to pass hostile symbolic measures? %$* 342
and now main street is boarded up, and property values have tanked. %$* 342
thank you. %$* 342
one. %$* 135
are gonna get caught up in that system. %$* 342
so what we are saying is, let’s have reasonable laws. %$* 342
mark talks about “licenses.” well, we are not giving licenses to immigrants to help them. %$* 342

thank you. %$* 342
karen narasaki. %$* 135
thank you very much. %$* 135
let’s give a warm applause to all of the speakers who have set the table for the debate. %$* 135
thanks to all of you. %$* 135
i am now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote, however you are thinking now. %$* 135
this is a bit of a snapshot of what you were thinking just a few moments ago. %$* 135
before the debate, this is how you voted. %$* 135
for the resolution, 42 percent, let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants. %$* 135
against the resolution, 34 percent. %$* 135
undecided, 24 percent. %$* 135
now we’ll have a chance to vote and see if those numbers change, at the conclusion of the debate tonight. %$* 135
we are now ready to begin the question and answer portion of the program. %$* 135
if you haven’t done so, please write your question down and send it to the aisles, it will get to me, and we’ll have a chance to be a part of this, uh %$* 135
a part of the, uh %$* 135
this more lively part of the debate. %$* 135
now, if i call on you %$* 135
i will pick from the cards, i will call on you. %$* 135
please stand, don’t ask your question until a microphone comes to you. %$* 135
and please identify yourself, if you are a member of the press. %$* 135
you know, i can’t say this enough. %$* 135
make your question short and to the point. %$* 135
um, there is only one charlie rose. %$* 135
we love him. %$* 135
i am gonna begin though by offering a question to each side of, uh, the audience here. %$* 135
um, and i, and i think it focuses on what i consider to be something of the elephant in the room in this whole debate. %$* 135
there are an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants in the united states. %$* 135
um, for those of you supporting the resolution - and i’ll address to you, heather. %$* 135
uh, under any regime that you have discussed tonight of “law enforcement” or “changes in laws,” how would you define “success”? %$* 135
and in the case that you would achieve that success, how many fewer of that 12 million undocumented immigrants would be in the country, after your regime is adopted? %$* 135
and to this side of the table, under any sort of change in immigration laws that any of you envision, how many of those 12 million would be allowed to stay, conditionally, unconditionally, or under any sort of regime that you envision? %$* 135
i’ll begin with you, heather. %$* 135
well, i, uh, i sort of reject the question, john, ‘cause i don’t think it’s necessary to put an absolute number on it. %$* 93
i would think “success” would be, uh, seeing the changed decision making that, that mark and i spoke about. %$* 93
that once you start enforcing the law, you are gonna see much fewer people come across the border. %$* 93
well, “much fewer”? %$* 135
how, how many fewer? %$* 135
in, in one stretch of texas that started, uh, not just putting people on the border, but detaining them, uh, after they were apprehended - rather than the current “catch and release policy” - there has been a 50 percent drop in illegal, uh, crossings %$* 93
in a few months. %$* 93
the washington post itself declared that this shows that the way to get control of the border is simply to enforce the laws %$* 93
on the books. %$* 93
we don’t need new laws; we just need to enforce what’s already there %$* 93
all right. %$* 135
something that has not been done. %$* 93
so, in five years, if enforcement - under the regime that you are talking about - actually took place, how many “fewer” undocumented immigrants would you expect to be in the united states %$* 135
down from 12 million? %$* 135
i, i, i really couldn’t predict. %$* 93
but fewer %$* 93
any fewer would be a success. %$* 93
whether it would be half that, uh %$* 93
i, i can’t say. %$* 93
but the fact is, is that right now, we are sending a message to the, hmmm, billions of people in this world that, once they get across the border, nothing happens to them. %$* 93
if we have an “amnesty,” i can predict what will happen: more will be coming in illegally. %$* 93
that is what the consequences have been of every amnesty %$* 93
in this country %$* 93
and in europe. %$* 93
uh, that record is quite clear. %$* 93
all right. %$* 135
thank you, heather. %$* 135
uh, enrique, let me ask the question to you. %$* 135
how many would you offer, uh, the chance to stay, of that 12 million? %$* 135
well, we have approximately 12 million undocumented people in the country today. %$* 340
and i think that the people that have %$* 340
that are the real criminals %$* 340
those are the people that should be in prison and %$* 340
that which is a very, very slow - a very, very small percentage. %$* 340
so the overwhelming majority of these people would be allowed to stay and become documented. %$* 340
they are not looking for citizenship; they are looking for a document, like the driver’s license. %$* 340
some sort of document. %$* 340
and a driver’s license doesn’t give ‘em the right to be here, by the way. %$* 340
but they are looking for a document that allows them to stay. %$* 340
it’s an economic plus to have the economic %$* 340
the, the undocumented people here. %$* 340
there is people from the wall street journal here, business week. %$* 340
they have all said that it’s an economic plus. %$* 340
seven billion dollars a year goes to social security just from the undocumented community. %$* 340
the median age of the u.s.population is 40 years old. %$* 340
the undocumented community is 25 years old. %$* 340
we need to replenish our workforce. %$* 340
uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, what, what’s happening in this country today, it’s very, very important. %$* 340
these people are here to work. %$* 340
when was the last time you saw a latino on a corner with a sign that says, “we’ll work for food”? %$* 340
you don’t see it. %$* 340
you’ll see ten of them at the home depot ready to jump in your car. %$* 340
we need the workers. %$* 340
unemployment is at 4-1/2 percent in this country. %$* 340
so they are an economic plus. %$* 340
they are, they are a plus to the values of this country. %$* 340
and it’s what that makes this a great country - a united states of america with all the colors. %$* 340
and so i say the 12 million people that are here - with the exception of the criminals, which is a very, very small percentage - they should be allowed to stay and have a pathway to legalization. %$* 340
so very close to 12 million undocumented immigrants would be allowed a chance to become citizens, under your plan? %$* 135
mm-hmm. %$* 340
to have document. %$* 340
to become documented. %$* 340
right. %$* 135
to become documented citizens. %$* 135
all right. %$* 135
uh, gerry ohrstrom has a question. %$* 135
he is on the left-hand side, in row h. could you stand? %$* 135
please. %$* 135
uh, thank you. %$* 203
um, heather, i think i’ll address this to you, my good friend. %$* 203
thank you. %$* 93
uh, given my utterly blind luck in being born american, by what moral authority can i deny that same opportunity and privilege to any of the world’s other six billion inhabitants? %$* 203
and any of your colleagues are welcome to respond to that as well. %$* 203
i think it is what nations do. %$* 93
they have borders. %$* 93
uh, if you are suggesting that there should be no more nations in this world, that is a very radical change. %$* 93
uh, and i don’t think that our, uh, neighbors to our south would agree with that either. %$* 93
you know, uh, enrique talks about our “inhumane laws.” well, mexico has about the fiercest, uh, border patrol that you can imagine, that rounds up central americans that are coming in transit to get to the united states. %$* 93
uh, this has been a prerogative of nations uh, throughout history, to decide who comes in. %$* 93
it, it’s not a “moral” question. %$* 93
it’s simply the right of, of nations to decide who is, is within their borders and who is outside of them. %$* 93
mexico, uh, you know %$* 93
several years ago, a governor of baja suggested that perhaps mexico has some responsibility for preventing these deaths, uh, in the desert, because they have a law that requires people leaving the country to exit through lawful ports of exit and entry. %$* 93
uh, and he suggested that maybe if mexico started enforcing that law, it would decrease the deaths. %$* 93
and of course, this created a massive outcry, uh, among the mexican elites, who believe that it is the right of mexicans to immigrate into the country illegally. %$* 93
i disagree with that and i think, uh, mexico itself would say the same about people from nicaragua and el salvador. %$* 93
john, could i just answer that? %$* 341
yeah. %$* 135
go ahead, mark. %$* 135
and i would have to disagree just a tiny bit and say that it is a moral question. %$* 341
that the nation is a moral good. %$* 341
uh, it often doesn’t behave morally, but that’s a different question. %$* 341
it is, hmmm %$* 341
peoplehood is part of what we as human beings have programmed in us; belonging to, uh, a people. %$* 341
and that means that we have a greater moral responsibility to those who are - us - who are, uh, fellow members of our people, than we do to foreigners. %$* 341
it doesn’t mean we have no responsibility to those who live outside our national community, but our priority has to be those who are our countrymen: just as you feed your children first, before you give money to charity. %$* 341
and so, i would submit that, um, that, uh, arguing that everyone in the world has a right to come to the united states is itself immoral. %$* 341
the argument itself is morally wrong. %$* 341
john, if i could %$* 340
uh, mark krikorian, thank you very much. %$* 135
i want to %$* 340
enrique. %$* 135
i want to address a couple of quick %$* 340
enrique morones. %$* 135
quick comments. %$* 340
one about the mexico part. %$* 340
and that was a, uh, senator, a former %$* 340
a former mayor of tijuana that made that statement, hector osuna. %$* 340
and the, uh %$* 340
and, and he is right. %$* 340
we cannot ask of the north what we don’t do in the south in mexico. %$* 340
and i was just down in mexico just two weeks ago. %$* 340
and this is a worldwide phenomenon. %$* 340
and mexico definitely needs to do more, as do the other countries around the world. %$* 340
so that, that %$* 340
with that being said. %$* 340
but the, the impact of u.s.policies affects the entire world. %$* 340
when you talk about the united states doing something, and it has a cold, it %$* 340
it sneezes, the entire world - especially the americas - get a cold. %$* 340
when mexico does something and it has problems, that stays within mexico. %$* 340
mexico doesn’t want the people to leave. %$* 340
they know that the future of mexico is within mexico. %$* 340
but the people are starving. %$* 340
we need to, uh, help the united states %$* 340
help mexico more develop, and help other countries as well. %$* 340
we have that moral responsibility. %$* 340
remember %$* 340

and if in fact it takes making that person unconscious in order to treat their symptoms, i'm willing to accept that with the consent of the patient that we both are willing to take that risk, because lots of patients are also make the tradeoff, i'd rather have a little bit of pain and have some time to visit with my family. %$* 502
so you've got to make that kind of decision jointly with the patient. %$* 502
and i'm not euthanizing patients when i give them morphine at the end of life. %$* 502
down in front here, please. %$* 13
third row. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
and if you could stand and tell us your name, thanks. %$* 13
jesse silburg this is to the team arguing for the motion. %$* 18
so, physicians are fallible. %$* 18
if we legalize assisted suicide, are we asking to risk their integrity? %$* 18
and are we asking too much? %$* 18
no, i don't think we're asking them to risk their integrity-- %$* 467
peter singer. %$* 13
we're asking them to act with integrity, to consider carefully whether the circumstances are the ones that are prescribed in the law, as we said, could be-- %$* 467
have various kinds of safeguards and reviews, and will minimize those kinds of mistakes. %$* 467
it is true that physicians, like everyone else, are fallible, and it is true that occasionally there may be a mistake, and it may be that somebody could have lived longer and even found their life worthwhile. %$* 467
we're not saying that that can never happen, because we know that in all human things, things could askew occasionally. %$* 467
but we don't think these rare possible cases are sufficient to say that nobody else can have these choice, nobody else can make this decision that "i've had enough," and that because of these very occasional mistakes, everybody else has to suffer through to the end whether they want to do that or not. %$* 467
up there against the wall. %$* 13
good evening. %$* 19
my name's caroline simpson. %$* 19
this question is for dr. %$* 19
sullivan. %$* 19
sulmasy. %$* 13
pardon me? %$* 19
dr. %$* 13
sulmasy. %$* 13
sulmasy or solomon. %$* 18
i apologize. %$* 19
solomon's not sullivan, and he's not a doctor. %$* 13
i'm conflating you. %$* 19
sulmasy is here. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
my question-- %$* 19
my question is, i'm a little confused whether you are relying on an intrinsic worth of life that just is prioritized over everything or whether it's the fact that you believe you can relieve all pain. %$* 19
hypothetically, if someone were in excruciating pain, that just-- %$* 19
unbearable, no matter what you did in terms of palliative care, would you still be against physician-assisted suicide? %$* 19
excellent question. %$* 13
yes. %$* 502
again, first of all, i'm not a vitalist. %$* 502
i don't think that life itself is the value here. %$* 502
and secondly, that i've suggested several times here that the person who is in the kind of excruciating pain you're talking about, under my care or dr. %$* 502
finlay's care, would be able to get increasing doses of morphine until the point that their pain was relieved, whether that hastened their death or not. %$* 502
my aim there is not to eliminate the patient, but to eliminate the patient's pain. %$* 502
and i foresee the possibility that this could happen, but that's not my aim. %$* 502
what i want to do is reverence people, right, and not act with the specific intention of making them dead, of turning a somebody into a nobody. %$* 502
i want to eliminate pain where i can. %$* 502
and if it takes making them unconscious in order to do that, i'm willing to do it. %$* 502
ma'am, did you-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
well, let's get the mic back to you because i just want to make sure-- %$* 13
it was a really good question, i want to make sure it's %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 19
i don't think you've answered my question. %$* 19
hypothetical-- %$* 19
take-- %$* 13
take 10 more seconds and get right at it. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
hypothetically, you cannot alleviate the pain. %$* 19
no, no, no, i just-- %$* 19
i'm trying to understand your underlying argument because this feels utilitarian. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
don't argue with him, please. %$* 13
just make-- %$* 13
make your-- %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 19
but i'm-- %$* 19
i would ask you to accept the hypothetical, but i can only ask. %$* 19
yeah. %$* 502
let-- %$* 13
i think-- %$* 13
i think your partner wants to take a crack at it also. %$* 13
can i answer? %$* 501
ilora finlay. %$* 13
because you've asked a practical question. %$* 501
i've seen patients whose pain score was 11 out of 10, not just 10 out of 10. %$* 501
i have sat there with a syringe full of diamorphine and injected slowly, milligram by milligram, minute by minute until their pain score is down and it is bearable, until we get it under control and redouble the efforts. %$* 501
and sometimes the person has seemed a bit sleepy for a time and we've had side effects and we've had to get over them. %$* 501
but my role as a doctor is to relieve that suffering. %$* 501
those patients may say, "i can't bear this, i ought to be dead," but that does not continue, that request does not continue when you get on top of their symptoms. %$* 501
i've had conversations with hundreds of patients about how they feel, about what's happening to them, many people are devastated when they first realize that they have a life threatening illness. %$* 501
the world is not as they thought it was going to be. %$* 501
but actually when you work with them, and it is hard work, they come through and they often have a fulfillment that they never imagined they could have before. %$* 501
i've had people who've wanted theoretically to have assisted suicide or euthanasia, but they've abandoned that when they themselves are ill. %$* 501
okay, i'm going to-- %$* 13
that's not the question. %$* 467
you both evaded the question. %$* 467
the question asked you to accept-- %$* 467
peter singer. %$* 13
the hypothesis that you can't relieve the excruciating pain. %$* 467
it's an attempt to understand your underlying philosophical or ethical position. %$* 467
and neither of you-- %$* 467
you've both just evaded that question. %$* 467
no, because i don't accept-- %$* 501
no, there's a fundamental premise here and a misunderstanding. %$* 501
those of us that actually are the ones with the drugs and the techniques to relieve the pain keep on trying and going back and back and back again, so you're painting a hypothetical question, i'm saying i faced it practically and i still oppose physician assisted suicide. %$* 501
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is "legalize assisted suicide." and here we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
those will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and remember how you voted just before the debate because right afterwards we'll have you vote a second time. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
first, on to round three, round three closing statements, and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, "legalize assisted suicide," peter singer, professor of bioethics at princeton university. %$* 13
oh, peter, for this one we'll remain seated on all these. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 467
sure. %$* 13
it's easier. %$* 467
well, let me wind up to introduce you again just for the ultimate radio broadcast of perfection. %$* 13
here to summarize his position for the motion, "legalize assisted suicide," peter singer, professor of bioethics at princeton university and author of the book, "practical ethics." %$* 13
we want you to support this motion because, firstly, we believe that people should be the ones to decide for themselves whether they think that continued life is worthwhile for them or not. %$* 467
we don't think that it should be up to anybody else to say, "we think your life is worthwhile." and, secondly, we think that there is a lot of unnecessary suffering, whether it's excruciating pain or not, there is suffering and distress of various sorts which continues and is going to continue for the foreseeable future in this system and it could be relieved by a relatively simple legislative reform that exists already and has been shown to work. %$* 467
now, in fact, this region today took a little step closer to that. %$* 467
you may not know that the new jersey state assembly today voted to pass the aid in dying for the terminally ill act which is similar to the other legislation that we've been discussing. %$* 467
it voted 41 to 31, so a fairly clear majority. %$* 467
it still, of course, has to go to the senate, and then it would need the assent of a candidate-- %$* 467
a governor who wishes to be the republican candidate for the presidency-- %$* 467
so it still has some way to go. %$* 467
but i just want to quote one of the supporters of that whose name is janet colbert. %$* 467
she's a retired oncology nurse, so she knows a lot about cancer and about people dying from cancer. %$* 467
she now herself has terminal liver cancer, but she supports this because she said, "as i battle my illness i would like the choice and comfort that comes with the option of aid in dying." that's all we're asking for. %$* 467
thank you. %$* 467
thank you, peter singer. %$* 13
the motion, "legalize assisted suicide," and here with his closing statement on the motion, daniel sulmasy, professor of medicine and ethics in the department of medicine and divinity school at the university of chicago, speaking against the motion. %$* 13
you know, i get questions frequently from patients who ask how i can be opposed to assisted suicide when they're getting sick from their chemotherapy, suffering complications from the big iv they've got stuck in their neck, are depressed and in pain, and spending more time in the hospital than outside it. %$* 502
so, i ask them, "why are you still getting chemotherapy? %$* 502
why have you got that big iv stuck in your neck? %$* 502
why not ask for hospice to help treat your pain and your depression? %$* 502
why go to the hospital? %$* 502
supporters of assisted suicide want-- %$* 502
our opponents want respect for their dignity and attention to their individual needs. %$* 502
but we're all human. %$* 502
we're fragile, interdependent, connected in bonds of mutual respect and support. %$* 502
suicide is always interpersonal. %$* 502
it's an act of communication. %$* 502
many persons who raise the question of assisted suicide are doing so because they're really testing the waters. %$* 502
they are asking us if we care enough to try to stop them. %$* 502
and when we don't stop them, we confirm their deepest fears and make it difficult for them to see an alternative. %$* 502
and if the suicide happens, their physicians and families must wrestle with it the rest of their lives. %$* 502
we shouldn't be about constructing a society that makes assisted suicide routine. %$* 502
rather, we should redirect our energies towards making sure that all patients get the kind of care that i think we all want, helping all of us to live to the fullness-- %$* 502
to the fullest, even as we're dying. %$* 502
so, i want you to vote for that kind of high-quality compassionate care at the end of life, and for the sort of ethical world that really makes that possible by voting no on assisted suicide. %$* 502
thank you, daniel sulmasy. %$* 13
and that is our motion: legalize assisted suicide. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position-- %$* 13
his position supporting this motion, andrew solomon. %$* 13
he is author of the award-winning book, "far from the tree" and the other book, "the noonday demon." andrew solomon. %$* 13
i take exception to the idea that all pain is treatable. %$* 500
it's not true to clinical data and it's not true to personal experience. %$* 500
and i also take exception to the idea that we value life by insisting that somebody-- %$* 500
to borrow your phrase "not become a nobody." that can be care, but it can also be oppressive. %$* 500
rilke wrote, "we need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go, for holding on comes naturally. %$* 500
we do not need to learn it.” death is not only the start of nothing, but also the end of everything. %$* 500
and it's important that it keeps faith with the way that someone has lived. %$* 500
nothing so resembles a person in his biography, as the manner of his or her death. %$* 500
the finale is what makes sense of the symphony. %$* 500
simone de beauvoir's mother begged her for help when she was sick, and simone de beauvoir instead took the word of her doctors. %$* 500
and afterwards, she wrote, "beaten by the ethics of society, i had abjured my own.” one is caught up in the wheels and dragged along, powerless in the face of specialist diagnoses that forecast their decisions. %$* 500
a race had begun between death and torture. %$* 500
i asked myself how one manages to go on living when someone you love has called out to you in vain? %$* 500
let us not treat those we love with that pusillanimous disregard. %$* 500
let us not institutionalize and enshrine in law prohibitions that force us to suffer contrary to our beliefs and force us to watch those we love suffer contrary to their expressed wishes. %$* 500
thank you. %$* 13
andrew solomon. %$* 13
our motion is "legalize assisted suicide." and here to summarize her position against this motion, ilora finlay, a palliative care physician and president of the british medical association. %$* 13
it's all too easy to be swayed by emotion and fear. %$* 501
but human beings are uniquely interconnected. %$* 501
if i accede to the request to provide lethal drugs, i actually give the message, "yeah, i think you're right. %$* 501
you'd be better off dead." i don't give the message that you are of worth. %$* 501
i've been there myself. %$* 501
my own mum was in hospice dying, angry, terribly angry that i was opposing the assisted suicide that she wanted. %$* 501
she thought it was the answer. %$* 501
this fiercely independent lady dreaded dependence. %$* 501
it broke my heart, and i was torn apart by it. %$* 501
an argument about philosophy with a member of staff let her see that her mind still worked, and she still had something to offer. %$* 501
so, she battled with us, all of us, and then went home, to everyone's surprise. %$* 501
she didn't die. %$* 501
she lived four more years. %$* 501
and in those four years, she saw her two great grandsons born. %$* 501
and she said they were the richest years of her life. %$* 501
they were important to her. %$* 501
they were important to us all, everyone, in the family. %$* 501
i beg you, it's not like in the movie. %$* 501
assisted suicide isn't straightforward and clean and quick. %$* 501
some people awake. %$* 501
six did in oregon. %$* 501
some people take a long time to die, up to 104 hours. %$* 501
that's not dignified. %$* 501
don't vote for this dangerous, dangerous law that actually deprives people of the possibility of having their dignity and having doctors who have to work to improve their quality of life. %$* 501
this law allows them to throw the towel in. %$* 501
thank you, ilora finlay. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
we'll get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
remember, the motion is "legalize assisted suicide." if, after hearing the arguments, you agree with this motion, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
if you became or remain undecided on it, push number three. %$* 13
we'll give it about 15 more seconds. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong button, just correct yourself, as i said before. %$* 13
it registers your last button push. %$* 13
and we'll lock out the vote. %$* 13
so, the first thing i would like to say is that this was an-- %$* 13
from the beginning, one of the most passionate debates we've ever had with a very, very high level of emotional intensity. %$* 13
but i had enormous respect for how the panelists on this stage kept it civil all the way throughout. %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
that is our goal here, and they met it. %$* 13
also, all of the questions were very, very good today, even the ones that went on a little bit long. %$* 13
they were-- %$* 13
they got to a good place. %$* 13
so everybody who had the courage to get up and ask a question, congratulations to them. %$* 13
i want to take a moment and thank our generous supporters who make these debates possible. %$* 13
our ticket sales do not cover, by any means, the cost of putting one of these on. %$* 13
so we encourage you to go to our website if you are interested in making a donation, because every gift counts for us and keeps it going. %$* 13
and thank you to those who have already done so and those of you who will. %$* 13
our next debate is here at the kaufman center. %$* 13
it will be on wednesday, december 3rd. %$* 13
our motion is, once again, a three-word motion: "genetically modify food." we will be looking at whether the world is better off or worse off with gm food crops, issues of safety, environment and food security. %$* 13
for the motion, we will have the chief technology officer at monsanto and a genomics and biotechnology researcher from uc davis. %$* 13
and against the motion, a research professor who studies agricultural technology, food quality and safety. %$* 13
and that debater is partnered with a former senior scientist from the union of concerned scientists. %$* 13
tickets are available at our website. %$* 13
and as we said at the beginning, if you can't get to our debates to be-- %$* 13
to watch them live, you can download our new app, the iq2us app. %$* 13
it's on the apple and android stores. %$* 13
and just search for iq2us at itunes or google play. %$* 13
and you can watch this debate and all of our debates at our live stream and listen to npr stations across the country. %$* 13
also, i want to make note that today we had a special section of our audience. %$* 13
we have the students and the debate coaches from the new york city urban debate league. %$* 13
they're with us tonight. %$* 13
and you guys can stand up. %$* 13
and they're going to be continuing debating this topic themselves over the next few weeks, so good luck to them with that. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, it's all in now. %$* 13
i have the final results. %$* 13
you have voted twice before the debate and again after the debate. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the preliminary vote on the motion "legalize assisted suicide." before the debate, 65 percent of you agreed with the motion. %$* 13
10 percent were against. %$* 13
25 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those were the first results. %$* 13
again, the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 67 percent. %$* 13
they picked up 2 percentage points, 2 percentage points is the number to beat. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, their first vote was 10 percent. %$* 13
their second vote was 22 percent. %$* 13
they pulled over 12 percentage points. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, "legalize assisted suicide," declared our winner. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

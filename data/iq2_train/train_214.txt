none of this would be evident to the naked eye if this person went through the airport. %$* 306
how about this, would you stop, for example, debra burlingame as opposed to asra? %$* 306
well, according to my adversaries, they'd stop asra but not debra because she's blonde and caucasian. %$* 306
here's the problem, colleen larose, 46-year-old, blonde hair, blue eyes, philadelphia, radical extremist, sought to recruit others to blow up a cartoonist in denmark. %$* 306
on the internet she said, "i can evade detection because i do not look like everybody's conception of what an extremist is." and then there was jamie paulin- ramirez, her co-conspirator, another blonde woman, this one with a six-year-old child, who was pregnant. %$* 306
she was another extremist radical. %$* 306
deroy says, "well, we ought to look at males because we know the males are the ones who are the terrorists." ltte, the extremist group in sri lanka, has trained female suicide bombers, including one who in april, 2006, masqueraded as a pregnant woman in order to kill eight people and wound 27 others. %$* 306
the problem with using racial and religious profiling is it takes you down a road to looking at people who you don’t need to look at and avoiding looking at people that you should look at. %$* 306
the fact is it would be an engraved invitation to al-qaeda to recruit exactly the kind of people who don’t fit the profile. %$* 306
and this is not speculation. %$* 306
i said this publicly when i was in office, and it’s been said by everybody in the intelligence community, we know that the targeting that al-qaeda has undertaken in the last four or five years in terms of recruitment has been deliberately aimed at westerners who have western passports who don’t fit the stereotype of what a muslim looks like and who therefore can pass under the principle of racial and religious profiling while we’re spending our time looking at asra, who we really shouldn’t be worried about. %$* 306
finally of course i guess there’s the argument that, "well, maybe we don’t look at people’s race because if we do that, based on our past experience, it’s going to basically include everybody, including blonde-haired blue-eyed women like colleen larose and jamie paulin-ramirez, but we ought to look at religion.” but here’s the problem, how are we going to look at religion? %$* 306
are we going to ask people at the airport what your religion is? %$* 306
do you think the terrorists are going to say, "oh, i’m a muslim"? %$* 306
no, they’re going to say, "i’m a presbyterian." they’re going to walk in with a big cross, if not a nun’s habit. %$* 306
i mean, the reality is these people are not stupid, and the more you target on obvious but misleading characteristics, the more you invite them to recruit in a pool that doesn’t meet that set of preexisting prejudices and biases. %$* 306
look, if i believed that it was a foolproof way to tell from someone’s appearance who is dangerous when they get on an airplane, i would say political correctness be dammed, let’s pick people who meet that appearance. %$* 306
certainly when we have a description of somebody, a particular person, and we’ve had this experience, we will absolutely look to people who fit that description. %$* 306
but the problem is, the proposition that is argued here doesn’t meet those standards. %$* 306
i challenge the adversaries to tell you what is the race, what is the appearance that they would rely upon? %$* 306
i challenge them to tell you how are they going to know what religion people are? %$* 306
are we going to have to start putting religion on our driver’s license? %$* 306
should we wear little arm bands? %$* 306
well, we don’t want to go down that road. %$* 306
we know where that wound up 50 or 60 years ago. %$* 306
i suggest to you, as hard as it is, and it’s tough because we all know that we personally are not terrorists and we don’t like to be searched. %$* 306
but more important when you get on an airplane is we want to be sure the person next to us isn’t a terrorist. %$* 306
and the way to do that is look at behavior, to use intelligence and frankly sometimes to use scanning and screening tools but not to rely upon racial or religious pre- conceptions which will only mislead us and ultimately, frankly, probably cause more damage than good. %$* 306
thank you. %$* 306
thank you, michael chertoff. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
now we move on to round two where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me as well. %$* 13
we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university and on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
i’m john donvan from abc news and at this intelligence squared u.s.debate we are arguing out this proposition, “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” on one side we have robert baer, formerly of the cia, deroy murdock, a columnist and asra nomani who is a former journalist for “the wall street journal” and an american muslim who recognizes, she says, the need for profiling. %$* 13
this side arguing that profiling is just a recognition of the fact that at this moment the threat comes from radical islam and it’s an unfortunate necessity that, they also argue, that it works. %$* 13
not to use it would be immoral. %$* 13
arguing against this motion, hassan abbas from pakistan, debra burlingame whose brother died on september 11 in the plane that crashed into the pentagon, and michael chertoff who was the second secretary of the department of homeland security. %$* 13
they are arguing that profiling is corrosive, basically that it is un-american, but most importantly, that it does not work. %$* 13
it gets you looking at the wrong people and missing the right people. %$* 13
i want to go first to you, asra nomani, you mentioned your dad, you said, is in his 80’s and he has been pulled off of lines at airports. %$* 13
he has. %$* 472
and that obviously being a case of a profile. %$* 13
i want to know in what way does your dad, other than the fact that he’s a muslim, fit the profile of a terrorist. %$* 13
how does that make sense? %$* 13
he’s got visa stamps from pakistan, saudi arabia, jordan so you’ve got travel through some of these nations that are problematic. %$* 472
and i think basically there’s the idea that we have a religion that you know characterizes all of the attacks that we’ve talked about. %$* 472
i mean, i’m really glad that michael, debra and hassan chronicled for us who the attackers have been. %$* 472
what is the one distinguishing characteristic of all of them? %$* 472
they’re muslims. %$* 472
we cannot deny that fact. %$* 472
we don’t pretend to have the answers on how we’re going to profile well, i’ll be honest with you. %$* 472
this is something that we have to identify. %$* 472
but the truth is that if we exclude religion and religiosity and interpretation of religion in our assessment of risk as was done to my father then we are not being honest about the threat as it exists today. %$* 472
but do you-- %$* 13
obviously we all know that your father wasn’t a threat but did it make any sense that day at the airport to pull him off the line given his age? %$* 13
well you know, does it make any sense what we’re doing with the pat-downs? %$* 472
you know, what was happening was that, i think, we’ve got this very impractical approach to security at airports right now and what i really believe we need to do is get a more common sense approach. %$* 472
we need to really look at who the adversary is and be very realistic about those type of individuals. %$* 472
so my dad may not fit because also there is as deroy mentioned in the research a clear age in which the threat has been coming from, age from about 20 to 30. and so i would love, if i could, to ask a question of hassan. %$* 472
sure. %$* 13
i was really glad that you mentioned the rand report. %$* 472
i think you have it. %$* 472
what’s the name of it again? %$* 472
the report, would-be warriors: incidents of jihadist terror radicalization in the united states since september 11, 2001, by brian jenkins. %$* 558
okay, so would-be warriors, an important point. %$* 472
hassan, what did the report establish related to the ethnicities of the individuals? %$* 472
there were 125 individuals that they looked at. %$* 472
and so do you remember what some of the ethnicities were that they chronicled? %$* 472
yes. %$* 558
they have chronicled in some cases, people who were radicalized within the u.s., someone who is born and raised here. %$* 558
for instance, i am no more interested in the ethnic background of that person who is born and raised here, whose equal right to be american or not. %$* 558
but it's really interesting because-- %$* 472
and so how is that relevant? %$* 558
it's really interesting because, i mean, i really recommend hassan's book, which is “a drift into extremism,” which chronicles incredibly the militancy inside of pakistan. %$* 472
and in fact in this rand report, what they established was very clear ethnic groups from which unfortunately this radicalism has emerged. %$* 472
and what are those nations? %$* 472
pakistani, yemeni, jordanian, egyptian, iraqi, lebanese, palestinian origin. %$* 472
and what connects them? %$* 472
islam. %$* 472
i mean, it is a sad reality, but unfortunately, these boys, our lost sons-- %$* 472
let me let your opponent, michael chertoff respond to that. %$* 13
i think the problem is this. %$* 306
asra, i don't disagree that there is an ideology that ferments and motivates extremism. %$* 306
the difficulty is that ideology is only a small percentage of the total population of the religion, that people who are motivated to get violent. %$* 306
and it's not evident on the face of the person coming through the airport that they meet that ideology. %$* 306
part of the problem is this. %$* 306
one of the-- %$* 306
again, you know, i mean i hate to disturb a good argument with the facts. %$* 306
but much of the recruiting that occurs in the united states occurs in prisons. %$* 306
and it occurs, frankly, with african-american prisoners who become muslim extremists. %$* 306
right. %$* 472
now, they don't fit that profile. %$* 306
they come from los angeles and compton. %$* 306
they don't come from pakistan and yemen. %$* 306
how are you going to deal with them when they go through the airport? %$* 306
the problem is what you're trying to argue is this: if we look at a certain class of people, we don't have to look at anybody else. %$* 306
and in that argument, you are giving the enemy the tool that they have told us they want, which is the ability to use our own prejudices as leverage to slip by our defenses. %$* 306
with all due respect, i mean, we are not talking specifically only about religion and race. %$* 472
at the end of the day, we have to be complete in our analysis. %$* 472
so we have to include religion, race, behavioral and all of the other factors. %$* 472
we don't look at just religion and race. %$* 472
i mean, this is exactly why driving while black becomes a problem because race is the only indicator. %$* 472
but what we're arguing is that include religion and race in the analysis because that's what-- %$* 472
does the other side-- %$* 13
anybody on the other side object to that, an inclusion-- %$* 13
let it part-- %$* 13
on the menu? %$* 13
i actually do, because-- %$* 557
debra burlingame. %$* 13
i thought the resolution was resolved, that u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling. %$* 557
and i don't think there's anything in there about behavioral or all the other-- %$* 557
well, i don't think it's-- %$* 472
all the other components. %$* 557
it's not exclusive. %$* 472
it's absolutely not exclusive. %$* 472
and when you-- %$* 472
when you-- %$* 472
when you-- %$* 472
let's-- %$* 13
let's let debra continue, and then we'll come back to you. %$* 13
because my understanding is that there are people who think that you can-- %$* 557
for instance, how would the screeners at the airport know that your 80-year-old father, what his religion was based on his passport stance because that means anyone who works with “wall street journal” who's active in foreign reporting, they're going to be pulled off too. %$* 557
i mean, i just think that it-- %$* 557
you're going down a road that-- %$* 557
where you're mixing apples and oranges. %$* 557
and i think that, again, the resolution isn't inclusive. %$* 557
it says racial and religious profiling. %$* 557
right. %$* 472
that's why i'm on this side of the panel because i do not believe that-- %$* 557
i don't know how you would administer that. %$* 557
if you-- %$* 557
if you object to the pat downs or some of the treatment that's going on at the airport right now, how are tsos, who are the airport screeners-- %$* 557
how are they going to be trained to-- %$* 557
to look people over and employ the kind of discretion that you're talking about in the-- %$* 557
in that sort of flash encounter they have with, i believe it's anywhere from 500 to 800 million passengers a-- %$* 557
a year in u.s.-- %$* 557
u.s. international-- %$* 557
u.s.carriers. %$* 557
so i guess what i'm saying is that i don't see how you can put-- %$* 557
if you're going for behavioral profiling, what does race and religion add? %$* 557
and how is that going to be administered by fallible people at the airport? %$* 557
well, the important point is that the motion is not exclusive. %$* 472
that's-- %$* 472
it is completely-- %$* 472
can include all of the other elements-- %$* 472
let me bring in deroy-- %$* 13
that are part of our issue. %$* 472
because we haven't heard from him in a bit. %$* 13
deroy murdock-- %$* 13
i would agree with what asra's saying. %$* 556
as i pointed out in my opening remarks-- %$* 556
arguing for the motion. %$* 13
this is not an either/or proposition. %$* 556
i believe that we ought to include, in our airport activities, racial and religious profiling. %$* 556
but nothing here in the resolution says that would be to the exclusion of behavioral profiling or anything else. %$* 556
i think we want to look at all of these things and this-- %$* 556
as we are doing now, we need to include this. %$* 556
i do think that that’s the sense of this resolution. %$* 13
this is clearly what-- %$* 556
clearly what is the threat we face today. %$* 556
and i think it's important to point out, as i think we've alluded, that the threat profile can change. %$* 556
we heard earlier about puerto rican terrorists. %$* 556
there is a wonderful bar here in town called front’s tavern that was blown up by people who wanted puerto rican independence back in the 1970s. %$* 556
even earlier than that, back in the 1950s, they opened fire on the floor of the u.s.house of representatives. %$* 556
well, over time, people who were interested in independence for puerto rico have expressed that through peaceful means. %$* 556
there is no longer a violence profile regarding people who are interested in puerto rican independence. %$* 556
it's really not something which we check for. %$* 556
at the moment, however, those people who we do see as targeting our aircraft and people upon them happen, almost always, to be people who are islamic and very often from the middle east. %$* 556
michael chertoff. %$* 13
but deroy. %$* 306
sorry. %$* 306
the hispanic names i mentioned were not puerto rican terrorists. %$* 306
they were islamist extremists. %$* 306
that's exactly the point i'm making. %$* 556
right. %$* 306
precisely the point i'm making. %$* 556
there was a threat profile back in the-- %$* 18
in the '50s through the '70s, when there were people who were for puerto rican independence and expected that violently. %$* 18
that no longer is the case so, that profile is just-- %$* 18
right. %$* 19
we're talking about the profile that exists today. %$* 18
are you advocating that we-- %$* 557
let me bring hassan abbas. %$* 13
hassan abbas. %$* 13
religion? %$* 19
and i-- %$* 558
arguing against the motion. %$* 13
may i ask one question? %$* 558
you have started your argument, by saying-- %$* 558
your first sentences were we have limited resources. %$* 558
we are short of time. %$* 558
so now you are arguing that every possible, everything that can be conceived of should be added. %$* 558
well, let's-- %$* 472
and you're asking-- %$* 558
let's try this. %$* 472
well, how-- %$* 472
let me complete the argument. %$* 558
let me complete the argument. %$* 558
i’m saying there are-- %$* 556
now you are arguing add 10 more things. %$* 558
well, let's-- %$* 472
that will become much more complicated. %$* 558
i'm-- %$* 556
we're talking about adding two. %$* 556
i'm sorry. %$* 556
go ahead. %$* 556
let's think about-- %$* 472
wait. %$* 13
bob baer, do you want to come in, and you can pass if you want. %$* 13
i go for the inclusive. %$* 559
i mean, you know, with christmas day bomber, he was from nigeria. %$* 559
he was black. %$* 559
he had been to yemen. %$* 559
he was a muslim. %$* 559
he was traveling with no luggage. %$* 559
bought his ticket with cash. %$* 559
i mean, he should have been profiled. %$* 559
and part of it was because he was muslim. %$* 559
i mean, but let me go back-- %$* 559
how would anyone know he was muslim? %$* 557
how would that-- %$* 557
you look at the name. %$* 559
if you-- %$* 559
you can look at the names. %$* 559
his name is an islamic name. %$* 559
it just does. %$* 559
like daniel maldonado, is that islamic? %$* 306
what? %$* 559
daniel maldonado an islamic name? %$* 306
no, but-- %$* 19
i think the point – %$* 472
jose padilla. %$* 557
i think the president of the united states has a muslim name, and he's a christian. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 18
now. %$* 472
but the point is when we do-- %$* 472
the point is that when we do profiling, we don't have to be stupid about it, either. %$* 472
i mean, it's-- %$* 472
it's very true. %$* 472
and if i could, i mean, i would suggest to hassan's question. %$* 472
i mean, how about if we take a few dollars away from this new security system that we have called cop-a-feel security, and basically turn it to some intelligent analysis of what the threat is about. %$* 472
i don't think the other side disagrees with that though. %$* 13
i'd like to say one thing. %$* 559
you know in 1954, the first state hijacking was conducted by mossad, by israel. %$* 559
i would have hoped, if there had been a tsa at the time, that they would have started looking at israeli jews. %$* 559
and would i have been called anti-semitic at the time? %$* 559
absolutely. %$* 559
but the fact is that was the first hijacking. %$* 559
it has nothing to do with islam. %$* 559
i still want to challenge-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
the other panel to explain how you're going to tell who is a muslim since presumably the enemy is going to lie about it. %$* 306
and since we don't, at this stage of the game, have travel documents that disclose your religion, it strikes me the premise of your argument is that you're going to be able to tell just by looking at somebody if they're a muslim. %$* 306
and i defy you in the face of the actual experience we've had to say that that's possible. %$* 306
bob baer. %$* 13
well, it's triage. %$* 559
it's never going to be completely accurate. %$* 559
but if you take a black american who just spent the last five years in yemen, it wasn't for-- %$* 559
but you're changing the-- %$* 306
i agree with you. %$* 306
if a guy spent five years in yemen, absolutely, look at him. %$* 306
that's behavior. %$* 306
and then you ask him if he's converted. %$* 559
but that's behavior. %$* 306
what you're not arguing, we all agree, i think, that if someone spent eight-- %$* 306
you know, five years in pakistan or five years in yemen, you might want to ask them more questions. %$* 306
this resolution says-- %$* 306
talks about racial and religious profiling. %$* 306
and we know what that is because we saw it on the new jersey turnpike 10 years ago. %$* 306
that is you see somebody, you say that person's-- %$* 306
as in the case of the turnpike, black. %$* 306
they're driving while black. %$* 306
i'm going to pull them over. %$* 306
that's racial and religious profiling. %$* 306
and that's what i think we're %$* 306
that's not what we're talking about at all. %$* 472
that is absolutely not what we're talking about. %$* 472
there is a phenomenon where they want to talk now about flying while muslim to compare it to that same issue of driving while black. %$* 472
but the truth is that we don't have to be discriminatory in order to be discriminating. %$* 472
we don't have to be prejudicial if we're going to be pragmatic. %$* 472
we can be very realistic about this. %$* 472
and just to point out this issue of threat, there have been 60 incidents since 1970 of attacks on airports and airliners. %$* 472
and in 1970, who were the attackers? %$* 472
it was the jewish defense league, the black panthers, black september, so the threat was very different from the threat that we have today. %$* 472
but it would have been very realistic and important for our national security and our airport security personnel to target those kinds of individuals because they were the ones who were perpetuating that kind of crime. %$* 472
our motion is not about figuring out how we're going to do it. %$* 472
we need to come to agreement i think and send a really important message that we are going to put away political correctness and look very practically at the issues of race and religion as they impact airport security. %$* 472
what michael is trying to do is take us down a path that i'm afraid we're not paid enough to do. %$* 472
debra burlingame. %$* 13
i think to punt on the subject, asra, with all due respect, of how we're going to do it, really is-- %$* 557
it doesn't do justice to the resolution because frankly you know the proof is in the pudding, %$* 557
especially since their argument is that it doesn't work. %$* 13
well, of course it works. %$* 559
the devil is in the details and i have to say it is quite true that there is assiduous recruiting going on in u.s.prisons. %$* 557
they call it “prislam.” it's a kind of a bastardized version of islam. %$* 557
and al-qaeda, which i believe is a very racist organization, by the way, it courts blacks in the prison population, and they foment the sense of injustices or some people who've been through some difficult histories, criminals, convicted criminals, and they play on their sense of injustice, but they do that outside the prison as well. %$* 557
you have these groups that are the civil rights-- %$* 557
these justice groups that are really-- %$* 557
i do not believe they're friendly to muslims, i believe that they are really friendly to the enemy. %$* 557
and they cozy up to material support. %$* 557
people who are involved in material support, some of them are even muslim brotherhood front groups. %$* 557
and they would absolutely use this kind of profiling as exhibit a of why you should be angry not only at the u.s.government but the people in your neighborhoods who live around you, come join us. %$* 557
and we know that they're doing that. %$* 557
debra, let me ask you a question, a little bit of personal experience, but it relates to something that the other side has said. %$* 13
i'm married to an israeli. %$* 13
i'm not jewish. %$* 13
any time i apply to israel without my wife i'm profiled as not jewish. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 18
and i go through-- %$* 556
i'm pulled off and i have a passport also full of arab country stamps. %$* 556
and i'm pulled off, i spend sometimes an hour, hour and a half, they actually in the middle of the night call my in-laws, "is this guy for real? %$* 556
" it’s a big pain in the neck, but once i’m on the plane i’m glad they did it to the guy behind me. %$* 556
and what i’m hearing from bob baer, you said the same thing about your daughter. %$* 556
i always getting profiled in tel aviv. %$* 559
and i’m hearing you're saying the same thing, and so if-- %$* 13
well, maybe for different reasons, but %$* 559
where is the offense? %$* 13
because especially your colleague hassan talked about that, about the stigmatization, et cetera. %$* 13
i want to hear more from you about that side of the argument because there is also that pragmatic side. %$* 13
it’s not nice, but if it keeps the planes flying, then i’m willing to go with it. %$* 13
i think because for all the reasons that we have said that we can give-- %$* 557
michael can go longer with all the examples of people who don’t fit that profile. %$* 557
and al-qaeda, you know, they’ve made some mistakes, but they’re very smart. %$* 557
they’re very adaptive, and they will find like mercury that you know they’ll find the crack and so-- %$* 557
wait, are you answering the question that i asked or-- %$* 13
what i’m saying to you is-- %$* 557
what i’m saying to you is that i think it’s-- %$* 557
it is offensive when you’re pulling people aside who have a sense within them that they have done nothing wrong. %$* 557
remember this is a community that’s already under assault. %$* 557
it pained me frankly to hear asra apologizing for the beast who did that brutality on 9/11 to my brother. %$* 557
i do not hold muslims responsible-- %$* 557
all of the muslims of the world responsible for the acts of a few. %$* 557
i’m not-- %$* 557
i do not. %$* 557
and-- %$* 557
okay. %$* 13
i want to go to the audience. %$* 13
as i mentioned at the beginning, i’d like to ask for four or five people just %$* 13
just one minute. %$* 13
i will take you. %$* 13
i forgot. %$* 18
i want to come to you to just raise your hand and give me one sentence answering this question, that as you hear the arguments so far-- %$* 13
.0-- %$* 13
the weakest thing that you’re hearing or the strongest thing that you’re hearing in one sentence, at most two, and we’re going to go very quickly, one, two, three, four. %$* 13
while you’re thinking about that, i want to go back to hassan abbas. %$* 13
i would argue in response to your concern that you feel more comfortable about the person that’s sitting behind you. %$* 558
there is life that exists outside those airports also. %$* 558
we have to look at the larger picture. %$* 558
those concerns can be responded to if you know that the law enforcement at the airport is effective, if you know that they have spent time researching that issue. %$* 558
whereas the consequence of this whole issue of every muslim or someone from one country background has to be looked at as i mentioned, it means that you’re isolating the whole community. %$* 558
it is fashionable today to be very critical of the muslims. %$* 558
so maybe many of the people will feel very comfortable. %$* 558
but look at it in an historical, larger, comprehensive context that you just are saying that all the muslims respond, they tell you why everyone is innocent unless %$* 558
is that part of your-- %$* 13
you made that point. %$* 559
without an educated tsa, this is going to lead to racist disaster. %$* 559
so part of his argument i want to bring to this side that you made in your opening statement, hassan, is that it does go bigger. %$* 13
if you see more muslims being pulled off to the side at an airport and the kids see that, are they going to grow up thinking there’s something wrong with muslims. %$* 13
are people who are going to try to get jobs as muslims going to be stigmatized in the larger sense because-- %$* 13
this is why the israelis put young men and women, well-educated, college educated who are very sensitive and they do not sit and insult these people. %$* 559
but there’s a point we have not touched on, it is that we are in two wars in the middle east, that we are killing muslims, and one war is illegal, the iraq war, and that’s just a fact. %$* 559
and a lot of this is where we’ve taken sides in the wars in the middle east. %$* 559
we need some sort of reaction in this country to defend ourselves. %$* 559
okay. %$* 13
i want to do a little bit for radio. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have six debaters, two teams of three, arguing out this motion, “u.s.airports should use racial and religious profiling.” and i’d like to just take a moment to take the temperature of the audience to gauge your opinion of what you’re hearing so far. %$* 13
anybody who would be willing to-- %$* 13
sir, i’m pointing right at you, if you can stand up we’ll bring you a microphone, and gentleman right in the front row in the gray cap, gentleman in the orange shirt and gentleman in the white shirt. %$* 13
and a woman? %$* 472
i wanted to-- %$* 13
let’s see, alright. %$* 13
we’re going to profile for opinions. %$* 13
and we’re going to swap out the young lady down in the front row. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
did you see any? %$* 13
oh yeah, i saw their hands. %$* 472
down in the front row, could you rise and stand up, we’ll come to you. %$* 13
and again, just one sentence and we’re going to go left to right and we’ll start with you, sir. %$* 13
so i understand the argument that racial profiling-- %$* 18
i really want you to do what i asked you to do which if you’re hearing-- %$* 13
right. %$* 18
it’s very short. %$* 18
so i understand the argument that racial profiling creates a blueprint for potential terrorists to avoid but i don’t understand how behavioral profiling doesn’t do the same thing. %$* 18
thank you. %$* 13
we’re going to bring the camera over to the gentleman in the front row with the gray cap and pink sweater. %$* 13
hang on a second. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
i would like to hear more from the panel against the motion what they think about countries who do racially and religiously profile and are successful like in israel. %$* 18
okay and to the front row, very first row, right behind the sign. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
i think we are assuming that terrorists have limited intelligence because the mumbai terrorist attacks were carried out by united states citizen called david. %$* 19
okay and orange shirt. %$* 13
the one thing that i’d like to hear that i have not heard, legal issues aside, the motion aside, is what does the data and the evidence show? %$* 18
does profiling make people on flights safer? %$* 18
do you mean racial and religious profiling? %$* 13
it’s a very vague term right now. %$* 13
racial and religious profiling at airports. %$* 18
can you rephrase that so that you don’t have me interrupting you? %$* 13
does the racial and religious profiling work. %$* 18
is there data on that? %$* 13
let’s go to bob baer on that if you know the answer. %$* 13
well i’d go back to israel. %$* 559
it’s a simple one. %$* 559
there’ve been no attacks on airplanes. %$* 559
they do profile, profile white, middle age christian americans and they tend to leave the orthodox and they know who the orthodox are. %$* 559
before they get on the airplane, they profile flight lists before they get on. %$* 559
and if you just take that one example, it works. %$* 559
let me-- %$* 306
michael chertoff. %$* 13
i did-- %$* 306
i used to get asked about the israeli situation all the time. %$* 306
the israelis do a very good job. %$* 306
but they have 20 flights a day. %$* 306
we have-- %$* 306
we have-- %$* 306
we have 20,000 flights a day. %$* 306
i mean, and i've talked to the israelis about this. %$* 306
the scale of what they have to do is really just trivial compared to what we have to do. %$* 306
it's a different system. %$* 306
by the way, when they take you into secondary, you don't get a virtual strip search. %$* 306
you get a real strip search. %$* 306
i've been shown what they do. %$* 306
they are-- %$* 306
they are much, much more thorough and aggressive. %$* 306
but they can do it. %$* 306
if we did that in our airports, and we looked at that some years back, you'd be waiting in line for nine hours. %$* 306
so i think it's not practical in the context of our airport architecture. %$* 306
can i mention something that we do have happening in our arguments today-- %$* 556
deroy murdock. %$* 13
there's a very interesting article that i've seen on msnbc.com about a man by the name of tom sawyer, no less, age 61. .8 %$* 556
he happens to have survived bladder cancer. %$* 556
and he flew from detroit to orlando. %$* 556
and as he was being patted down by the tsa, he said, “look, i need to tell you that there is a-- %$* 556
i have a medical condition.” and the tsa agent didn't want to hear it. %$* 556
he proceeded to pat him down very hard. %$* 556
the-- %$* 556
basically a bag that collects urine burst, and this poor man was covered in his own urine and had to fly on a plane that way. %$* 556
and so my question to michael chertoff, who i guess you supervised the tsa when you were secretary of homeland security. %$* 556
what would you say to someone like him who's gone through this really humiliating experience? %$* 556
why should we call it the status quo rather than using racial and religious profiling in our arguments? %$* 556
that's completely unacceptable behavior for someone to do that. %$* 306
but the fact is you get a minority of people who are either belligerent or behave improperly. %$* 306
doesn't mean that the right answer is to racially profile. %$* 306
supposing the guy had been a muslim from pakistan? %$* 306
same thing would have happened. %$* 306
is it just that we couldn't care because he was a muslim? %$* 306
i mean, that's-- %$* 306
you know, part of the problem is people-- %$* 306
i really understand-- %$* 306
i travel a lot by air. %$* 306
i go through the same thing everybody else does. %$* 306
people are looking for a magic bullet. %$* 306
they like to know there's some way to distinguish the bad guy from me. %$* 306
the problem is, while we all know we are not terrorists ourselves, we don't know who the next guy in the seat is. %$* 306
and until we find a foolproof way to do it, or unless we have real knowledge about everybody who flies, real background checks on the hundred million people a year who fly, using racial profiling is a way of avoiding bad behavior by a tso is not the right answer. %$* 306
let's go to some questions now from the audience. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
we had one question that we didn't answer. %$* 472
which one? %$* 13
up here, which was that we're making assumptions, because, for example-- %$* 472
wait, wait. %$* 13
the person who did the mumbai attack-- %$* 472
can you re-ask the question with a little bit-- %$* 13
a little bit more context? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i just want to give an example of where, for example, profiling is used based on what has happened earlier. %$* 19
and in india, every terrorist attack has been, for example, been from pakistan. %$* 19
and we were warned that terrorist acts were going to happen in mumbai, apparently. %$* 19
but nothing came of it because we were profiling according to the kind of terrorists that we had earlier. %$* 19
and the person who carried it out was an american citizen called david headley. %$* 19
and we just completely missed him because we weren't looking for him. %$* 19
so what's your question? %$* 13
how would you phrase it? %$* 13
my question is if we had focused on behavior instead of for example, religion, we might have found him. %$* 19
but what i would actually argue is that, for example, in the case of the mumbai attacks, and this-- %$* 472
this man, david headley, he was muslim. %$* 472
he was from pakistan. %$* 472
he had changed his name so that he could hide his identity. %$* 472
i mean, bob can speak more to this. %$* 472
but obviously, in terrorist circles, there is something that they call false flag operations, where people try to hide their own identity. %$* 472
and we have to outsmart that. %$* 472
i mean, we have to be one step ahead of them in terms of how they're trying to hide their identity. %$* 472
and that's what i think david headley was doing. %$* 472
hassan abbas. %$* 13
there is something-- %$* 558
there was a question about-- %$* 558
there was a question about what the studies tell us. %$* 558
is there a data set? %$* 558
there are three or four things, very briefly, i’ll mention. %$* 558
one was an advisory by the department of justice in 2003, which very categorically said that racial and religious profiling is not only wrong. %$* 558
it is counterproductive. %$* 558
i can mention to you many studies as my own background as a law enforcement officer, as a punjabi in a pashtun land in northwest frontier province. %$* 558
whenever-- %$* 558
even in south asia, there are studies. %$* 558
whenever you try to look at the whole community, then you lose all the people who are the agents of change and who, within those societies and communities can stand up and challenge. %$* 558
so you lose completely that community. %$* 558
all the academic studies, especially, for instance, there is an association of police chiefs in the united states. %$* 558
they have mentioned time after time that these traffic stops, always stopping the blacks or the latinos, that has not proved to be effective. %$* 558

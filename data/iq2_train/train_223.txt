we americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. %$* 580
we don’t know about anything that’s happening outside our country, our stupidity is embarrassing.” and michael moore has achieved the stature of a cult figure in germany, and, and immense popularity, i think germany is probably the country where he’s most popular, but all around europe he enjoys a, a, uh %$* 580
a popularity near that dimension. %$* 580
okay, let me just, um, let’s start with, um— let’s start with the questions. %$* 577
yes, miss. %$* 577
thank you, i—i have a question for those against the motion. %$* 178
i want to put a finer point on the question itself and the way you’ve addressed it. %$* 178
one, um—the question isn’t whether hollywood was responsible for the anti-americanism abroad, the question is whether it has fueled that anti-americanism. %$* 178
and we’re seeing a lot of movies coming out of hollywood that use stereotypes. %$* 178
it used to be russians and communists during the cold war. %$* 178
now we have almost cartoon-like arabs and muslims in the movies. %$* 178
do the panelists against the motion feel that that adds to anti- americanism abroad generally. %$* 178
well, i’ll speak to that, i think, uh, no, i don’t believe that that fuels anti-americanism. %$* 579
movies like michael moore’s movie, and i think michael moore is an overfed, underloved narcissist, i’m not a fan. %$* 579
uh, but when people abroad look at a movie like that, what they see about america is that america’s a place where people can be critical of the—of their own nation. %$* 579
um— i—i— i’m sorry— %$* 577
i sponsored a—i try to cut down on some of my activities but i could—as a jew and as an american i could not turn down the fulbright commission when they asked me to, uh, sponsor an egyptian scholar, i had to reach out to my arab muslim brother, particularly at this time, don’t you think. %$* 579
and what he loved about america was its ability to, uh, be critical of the administration, he said if people spoke that way of mubarek they would be %$* 579
disappeared, or off the street. %$* 579
american films, uh %$* 579
they extol, essentially, the american dream, and what is the american dream, the american dream is a certain materialism to be sure, nothing wrong with that. %$* 579
people who can’t get the basic material, food, clothing, shelter for themselves, for their children, they will listen to any tyrant, any dictator. %$* 579
we’ve seen dreadful, dreadful history, uh, throughout history and especially the last 100 years, testifying to the truth of that proposition. %$* 579
so a certain materialism’s okay and people across the world, they, they just love what they see, they love the material stuff that they see in, in hollywood films, but more to the point %$* 579
hollywood films extol the notion of the american dream, and what is the american dream. %$* 579
it’s the notion that if you’re willing to work hard, if you’re willing to get educated, in this country you can do anything. %$* 579
you can move up from your lowly station and achieve anything if you’re just willing to again get educated and, and, uh, and work real hard. %$* 579
now people will tell you on both sides that that’s a hoax, that’s kind of like the lottery designed to, uh, let people, uh, imagine they can do things that they can’t, but i must tell you from my perch at ucla and in hollywood, i see people break through every day, you’ll hear that it’s about connections, who you know. %$* 579
that’s bunk, i know really well-connected people who cannot get arrested in hollywood and i see absolute fresh faces break through every day. %$* 579
like it, don’t like it, there’re so many myths, so many hoaxes about hollywood, one of the biggest among them, is that it is not a meritocracy, it’s all about connections. %$* 579
the fact is that hollywood is a remarkably democratic place, and truly a meritocracy, people succeed on the basis of their talent, on the basis of their ingenuity and their, their discipline, and it’s a great credit to this nation, i think it’s the greatest industry that we have. %$* 579
one sentence in reply, we were encouraged to break in. %$* 580
uh, richard, it may be perfectly true that in some authoritarian countries, if they see a film, an american film that is viciously, uh, hostile to the american government, they say, oh, in america they have free speech, i wish i did too, that— that—that point is valid, but i was talking about europe. %$* 580
and they have just as much free speech in europe and france and the uk as we have here. %$* 580
and when those audiences, uh %$* 580
eat up what michael moore is offering, they’re not sitting there saying, oh, isn’t this wonderful, there’s free speech in the united states. %$* 580
joshua— %$* 581
okay—i’m sorry, go on. %$* 580
joshua, you scare me. %$* 581
i mean you’re, you are scaring me. %$* 581
and, and that’s fueling my anti-americanism right now. %$* 581
but— %$* 581
and just to add, and just to underscore what one of the questioners said, and that is that if you’re supporting the motion, the motion is not seeking the sole causative factor of america, uh, anti-americanism. %$* 577
it’s saying whether it’s fueled. %$* 577
and also it doesn’t say that motion pictures are the sole cause. %$* 577
we’re talking about generic hollywood, which includes the export of the pop culture, which includes television and music, et cetera. %$* 577
it’s the entire pop culture and what we’re depicting as an american image. %$* 577
so are you asking for a, uh, a completely whitewashed export, export? %$* 581
so we should all go back to the days of june cleaver and, and promote the wear – maybe we should all be wearing pearls and vacuuming. %$* 581
is that, is that what you want? %$* 581
well, i think it’s been, it’s been clearly defined that the motion we’re debating has nothing to do with censorship. %$* 581
as a matter of fact – and i applaud – %$* 581
it’s not clear. %$* 581
he’s asking for censorship. %$* 581
no, no, he’s not. %$* 581
he’s saying, censor things that i don’t agree with. %$* 581
no, we’re asking for responsibility. %$* 581
i didn’t say anything about that. %$* 580
of course you are. %$* 581
when did i say that? %$* 580
what did i-- %$* 580
you don’t, you, you don’t want to have michael moore have a voice or, or, or anyone else that you don’t seem to agree with. %$* 581
josh did not say that. %$* 581
that’s not true. %$* 580
i mean, that’s, that’s nonsense. %$* 580
i didn’t say anything like that. %$* 580
and you know, and you know what? %$* 577
i think, i think we can have some questions. %$* 577
i, uh, uh, i don’t, i don’t want to censor him, uh, but i want to pour my own, uh, uh, contempt on him. %$* 580
and i want to expose him for what he is. %$* 580
well, you know – %$* 577
well, make a documentary and pour your contempt on him. %$* 581
uh, you know, i think we have some questions for – %$* 577
well, i’m not a filmmaker. %$* 580
i’m, i’m a, uh, writer and a speaker. %$* 580
so i’m here speaking. %$* 580
yeah, but, uh, robin-- %$* 577
and, and i’m exposing michael moore for what he is. %$* 580
but robin, you’re scaring me. %$* 580
okay, let’s have some questions. %$* 577
um, sir. %$* 577
here, right here. %$* 577
right here, sir. %$* 577
oh, i’m sorry. %$* 577
uh-- %$* 577
uh-- %$* 577
he, and after, this man after him. %$* 179
i, i think i’m going to, uh, uh, yield the floor to the gentleman down there, as the two questions that i was going to ask have both been debated and, and talked about already. %$* 179
okay, this, this gentleman over here. %$* 577
sir, here you go. %$* 328
uh, most of what i’ve heard tonight, if you’ll pardon me, has not had a whole lot of intellectual rigor attached to it. %$* 179
okay. %$* 31
whoo. %$* 31
i heard some very salient points from both sides. %$* 31
i think michael moore, how can i say, as a professional documentary, uh, i’m going to say, maker really should go some place else because there are people that misconstrue what he says. %$* 31
but he follows, he doesn’t lead. %$* 31
okay? %$* 31
i think that we’ve had people abroad for a very long time. %$* 31
it’s those people that have created impressions about how we behave, what we do, what we care about. %$* 31
i think, uh, paul theroux made a point in, uh, one of his last books, traveling in the third world, where he said something about people don’t hate americans. %$* 31
people hate our government. %$* 31
boo. %$* 179
okay, i think that movies basically follow, okay. %$* 179
and there’s been something out there for a long time. %$* 179
it’s not hollywood. %$* 179
it’s every industry we’ve got that’s out there that’s exporting a certain way. %$* 179
and those are the problems. %$* 179
and it’s not, if you will, industry generic. %$* 179
okay. %$* 179
but do you have a question for any, any of, any of us? %$* 179
well. %$* 179
sorry, sorry. %$* 179
yes. %$* 179
i would say, other than, uh, sorry robin, that, uh, i haven’t heard anything really supportive, other than sort of broad innuendo, okay, uh, about this and that. %$* 179
i think that it’s all connecting. %$* 179
okay. %$* 577
alright, okay. %$* 577
and i’d like to hear some really more, how do you say, substantive facts about how we proceed. %$* 577
okay. %$* 179
i, i hear you. %$* 179
um, sir, down there. %$* 179
thank you. %$* 179
um, i hope i’m not, uh, rendering this to be redundant when i say that as, um, someone who is not american i can confirm that, uh, hollywood has fueled, uh, anti- americanism abroad. %$* 179
um, growing up in, uh, in europe i, um, i sense an extreme cynicism on the part of, um, of, you know, my, my, uh, my peers, um, in the sense of the smugness, um, with which american represents itself. %$* 179
i mean, i-- %$* 179
uh, but do you have a question? %$* 179
yes, i do. %$* 179
and, uh, and what i’d like to, to, to ask is that, is, uh, what do the members of the panel feel about, uh, the makeup of the panel in the sense that there are, are conservatives who were saying that, you know – who, who i agree with, essentially. %$* 179
but at the same time, um, i am ex %$* 179
extremely kind of like, um, disillusioned with american foreign policy and the war, particularly. %$* 179
and, um, and i wonder why there’s such a demarcation of, um, of opinion. %$* 179
um, i, i agree with james hirsen in the sense that, um, you don’t have, you know, hollywood is not the, the only factor. %$* 179
but at the same time, um, it, it is a factor. %$* 179
but, um – %$* 179
okay, yeah. %$* 577
i won %$* 577
i won %$* 577
i just wonder what people have to say about that. %$* 577
well, we’ve, we’ve sort of covered that. %$* 577
you know, that, how, it, it’s hollywood and it’s, um, policy. %$* 577
we, uh, yes sir. %$* 577
sir, here you are, sir. %$* 328
hand that over to him, please. %$* 328
yeah, i have a question for mr. %$* 328
greenwald. %$* 328
i was, uh – %$* 328
okay. %$* 179
impressed that you in some, took advantage of your political activity and your personal feelings about the war. %$* 179
you didn’t mention one part of it, and i don’t know why, and that, people seem to be frightened to mention – and that is our support for israel. %$* 179
my son just got back from jordan, where he’s doing some work on middle east policy. %$* 179
and he said he was shocked how radicalized jordan had become in the last month, that they, they have their hatred for us because of our support of our support of, quote, "the little satan." the european countries feel the same way. %$* 179
and when they belittle and undermine american policy and look at our motion pictures as an example of our lives it just furthers their hatred for us. %$* 179
and they don’t know why we’re supporting israel at the expense of their nation. %$* 179
now we know why. %$* 179
all right, but what is that, you say, let me just, uh, uh – yeah. %$* 577
just, uh, what does that have to do with hollywood? %$* 179
because he was making statements as a political activist that he brought this, uh, business about the war in when they were talking about motion pictures. %$* 179
right, okay. %$* 179
so my question is, i think there’s a big part of it that’s being overlooked here – is that our support of israel, which i fully support, is a large part of the hatred of america today. %$* 179
all right, but let’s, okay, let’s, let’s just stick – uh, i appreciate that, sir. %$* 577
okay. %$* 577
but let’s just stick to the issue of hollywood and hollywood’s impact on, you know, foreign, uh, on abroad and what impact it has, either positive or negative, and, you know, um, let’s stick to has hollywood, hollywood has fueled anti- americanism abroad. %$* 577
has it or has it not? %$* 577
yes sir. %$* 577
well, to your point – and to go back to the point this lady made, uh, which was the, i thought the most intelligent comment that anybody’s made so far – which is that the, uh, the side against has, um, distorted this entire, uh, debate by, by moving off the "hollywood has fueled anti- americanism abroad" issue to the war. %$* 179
we are not discussing the impact of the war. %$* 179
the war has its own impact. %$* 179
we all know that. %$* 179
but for you to, to de %$* 179
deflect that, uh, into this, this, this main issue, i think is not really meeting the point of the debate. %$* 179
and therefore by definition you lose. %$* 179
well, i, i, i quite disagree. %$* 579
you’re not arguing the, you’re not arguing the point. %$* 579
uh, i don’t think it’s fair at all what you say, respectfully. %$* 579
uh, we’re, we know there is a rise around the world, uh, in anti-american sentiment. %$* 579
um, we’re arguing that’s it not, not, uh, hollywood fueling that. %$* 579
aren’t we allowed to say what we think, uh, just might have something to do with that? %$* 579
can anybody doubt, if you read the papers, what it is that, uh, that, that fuels this – these wrongheaded and disastrous policies that represent the opposite of the american ideal and the american tradition? %$* 579
yeah, but there was a lot of anti – if, if it was, if it was a le – if it was a court case and hollywood was being tried as, you know, the guilty one for the crime we’re saying, no, we know who the guilty one for the crime is. %$* 583
we know what that guilty is and it’s the war. %$* 583
there’s no, no question about it. %$* 583
i understand your point and we could parse the words. %$* 583
what does fuel mean? %$* 583
how much fuel? %$* 583
but i actually think it’s much more substantive to go to the real, the real question-- %$* 583
or the real question behind the question, from my point of view, maybe not yours – and say, here is why anti- americanism is being fueled a %$* 583
abroad. %$* 583
we know the reason. %$* 583
yes, but that-- %$* 583
yes, but that would assume that, that anti- americanism is a new phenomenon. %$* 583
it’s not. %$* 583
we’ve had it – no. %$* 583
no, not new. %$* 583
but the numbers are – uh, there’s no – do you doubt that the numbers are increasing? %$* 583
yes, i do. %$* 583
i do. %$* 583
since – wait a minute. %$* 583
you don’t think since the iraqi war that it’s not increased? %$* 583
well, i, i, i can – it’s not increasing numbers because you questioned whether we could debate the statistics. %$* 578
yes, and i’ve got the pew poll, um, yeah, okay. %$* 578
good. %$* 578
the pew poll sampled – i got, you got your copy, i got mine. %$* 578
sampled, uh, nine hundred and two people in great britain. %$* 578
four hundred and twelve of them were muslim. %$* 578
nine hundred and five in france, four hundred were muslim. %$* 578
that’s %$* 578
nine hundred and two in germany, four hundred and thirteen are muslim. %$* 578
that does not reflect the percentages of the %$* 578
populations in those countries. %$* 582
that poll, that poll is statistically invalid. %$* 582
um, well, let me get this. %$* 577
yes sir. %$* 577
i’m sorry. %$* 577
well, wait, wait, wait. %$* 577
i, i want to get in on this, please. %$* 577
okay. %$* 577
because, uh, the, the two, the two people in the audience, uh, nailed this point more, uh, most clearly. %$* 580
it is, it is not a court case. %$* 580
this is not a crime in which there’s one victim and one perpetrator. %$* 580
we’re talking about attitudes in the world that involve, uh, hundreds of, of millions or billions of people. %$* 580
and there are many causative factors. %$* 580
and i don’t know what it is about the word fueling that you don’t understand. %$* 580
but the question here is whether hollywood is one of those factors. %$* 580
and the very simple, uh, uh, you, answer to your effort to put this all on iraq is that there was a lot of anti-americanism in the world, uh, before the war in iraq. %$* 580
there was a lot of anti-americanism in the world before bush was elected president. %$* 580
there was a gallop poll, uh, of the muslim world, taken, uh, a year before the war in iraq, that – but after the war in afghanistan, in which larger numbers of the respondents, uh, said they thought that, uh, that 9/11, the attack, the terrorist act of 9/11, was justified, than thought that our attack on the al qaeda and taliban in afghanistan, uh, was justified. %$* 580
and you can go back, uh, uh, to the nineties when we were discussing enlarging nato and there was a huge, uh, uh, outpouring of, uh, of, uh, anti-americanism in europe, afraid that the perpetuation of, of, uh, of nato would be, as the french foreign minister put it, a trojan horse to, to keep the americans in control, uh, of nato.this anti- americanism comes from many reasons. %$* 580
it comes from some policies that we may think are wrong or, or iraq or what have you. %$* 580
it comes from other policies that fewer people, uh, in this room would disagree with, as this gentleman pointed out, uh, from our support for israel. %$* 580
uh, i spend, uh, a lot of time in the middle east. %$* 580
and when you talk to middle easterners they have two grievances against america at this moment and the war in iraq is number two. %$* 580
it’s our support for israel that’s, uh, that’s number one. %$* 580
and, uh, the, the issue of, uh, the fact is that we’re not going to be able to conduct ourselves in the world according to any policies without making some people angry, some people dislike us and so on. %$* 580
the question that we’re talking about tonight is whether the fare that michael moore and oliver stone and, uh, the, the other, uh, uh, hollywood opinion shapers are putting out to the world, uh, contributes to and compounds that. %$* 580
the, the, yeah. %$* 583
well, let me respond. %$* 583
first of all, you did see the sentence here. %$* 583
i know you did not intentionally leave it out – which is clearly marked, “sample is weighed to be representative of the general population. %$* 583
“ so you’re not just quoting the first – let me finish. %$* 583
no, i understand that it says that. %$* 580
but look at the percentages. %$* 580
so you’re not just quoting – so i understand-- %$* 580
but look at the percentages. %$* 583
okay, but it says that. %$* 583
you got the percentages from here and it says, we know the percentages are too large and like good statisticians did, we adjusted for it. %$* 583
but let me go back to the substantive point, cause you’re just wrong on that one. %$* 583
the substantive point is, i think, goes back to what bernie said. %$* 583
yes, michael moore has three best selling books in germany. %$* 583
but it doesn’t compare to the titanic, star wars, e.t., pirates %$* 583
and lord of the rings. %$* 583
it’s not even close. %$* 583
and how do we make the case that those movies that are loved around the world, they’re embraced around the world, that people fight to get in and see around the world – how do we say that is fueling anti-americanism? %$* 583
and, and your – we don’t. %$* 581
nobody says that. %$* 581
and, and your question is – and what we’re saying is – so you’re agreeing with us. %$* 581
thank you. %$* 581
no, hollywood is not a factor, is not a significant factor. %$* 581
yes, there are many reasons. %$* 581
i mean, it could be the proliferation of trans fats across the world. %$* 581
there are many reasons. %$* 581
but hollywood is not the most significant reason why anti- americanism is growing around the world. %$* 581
all right, let’s get some questions. %$* 577
um, uh, uh, yes sir. %$* 577
hi. %$* 577
uh, i have a question for james hirsen and, uh, dana wolfe said i should identify myself as robert siegel of npr. %$* 577
okay. %$* 577
i’ll be actually hosting the radio, uh, broadcast of the debate. %$* 33
and my, my question is, in the schema between the, the heroic golden age of hollywood and the modern cynical age that you’ve drawn, uh, where would the movies of frank capra fit? %$* 33
that is, in it’s a wonderful life, uh, there’s the fact that a banker and real estate developer is clearly villainous and evil, even though we know in real life in the decades since that time – he’s, he’s been the more efficient actor in the economy who has prevailed over the sentimental profligate s&l, which is heroic. %$* 33
was that, was that a movie that fanned anti-americanism at the time by, uh, presenting business in a negative light, or for that matter, was mr. %$* 33
smith goes to washington, which made a great deal out of big time corruption-- %$* 33
a movie that fanned anti- americanism? %$* 33
or are we more sensitive today than we were then to the images of us on the screen? %$* 33
okay, good question. %$* 582
i think it’s the degree of specialization that hollywood has had in villainizing and demonizing the representatives of free enterprise. %$* 582
and why, and why do i even talk about free enterprise? %$* 582
because america in the world represents the greatest experiment in free enterprise in the history of man. %$* 582
i mean, western civilization generally – and america specifically – is an aberration in human history. %$* 582
and part of the whole class warfare concept, really, is to make success something that you should feel guilty for. %$* 582
and you see this theme running through. %$* 582
and it, and it’s, and it becomes more prevalent when oliver stone names a character after a lizard. %$* 582
it becomes more prevalent when we have this series of movies where the plot line involves the evil corporation and the crusading worker or journalist, or single mother with a push-up bra. %$* 582
it, it, it’s the same pattern but what it does is, it takes away from a great part of this country. %$* 582
instead of something that could be told which is sort of the entrepreneurial cowboys in this country, going back to the luminaries like thomas edison to national treasures like steve jobs. %$* 582
who creates prosperity around the world through innovation that is fostered by a system that didn’t happen by accident. %$* 582
i think that that, that is a significant and more subtle point of anti-americanism though i, i say it’s not exclusive to the period after the decline of the studio system in the sixties. %$* 582
but then again, frank capra also made films, a series of films called why we fight that were made specifically during a time of war to bolster our side and demoralize their side. %$* 582
instead today, as we brought up with syriana and other films of that elk, films are being made to bolster their side – and to demoralize our side. %$* 582
we have time for one more question, okay? %$* 577
uh, that gentleman over there. %$* 577
i'm sorry. %$* 577
god um, lets make it, sorry, lets make it a woman. %$* 577
okay, the lady over there. %$* 577
five what? %$* 577
five men and one woman and every movie you’ve mentioned has been produced and directed by men. %$* 178
we are fifty percent of the population and i would appreciate us being represented. %$* 178
okay, is there another question? %$* 577
i want to answer that. %$* 580
if every movie i’ve mentioned was produced by a man, it just shows that women are not guilty for uh, for fueling anti-americanism. %$* 580
miss. %$* 580
i was just going to ask the same question that he did, only about the best years of our lives, the great movies from the thirties or forties, was it? %$* 178
right. %$* 178
i mean, what has been the change? %$* 178
what’s changed since then that’s made our attitudes so completely different? %$* 178
and the, the short word is the 1960s. %$* 578
i mean why is it that today you can never hear the word corporation? %$* 578
this is now, it’s, it’s synonymous with evil. %$* 578
and if you prefix the word corporation with multinational, it becomes kind of the, the epitome of all evil. %$* 578
why is that? %$* 578
i mean sure there were plenty of movies in the past that may have represented this or that businessman, this or that politician as corrupt or evil, but now it’s always the case. %$* 578
i mean some of my colleagues mentioned movies that, where they’ve changed the plot. %$* 578
i mean, and i’ll just mention one more, the bourne identity. %$* 578
in the book, the bad guy was carlos the jackal. %$* 578
in the movie, it’s the cia and this is consistent. %$* 578
i mean it’s just every kind of thriller that you see these days uh, the united states government, the united states military, the united states commercial enterprise. %$* 578
it’s always presented as somehow corrupt, venal, savage. %$* 578
alright we have one more question from this gentleman – %$* 577
obviously artists always have an obligation to their countries, but are you really going to sit here and compare frank capra’s obligation to an america that had been attacked at pearl harbor and was threatened by a nazi menace with the obligation of an artist today who’s facing a war that was effectively picked and is uh, demonstrably going nowhere during the same time frame that it took to win all of world war ii? %$* 584
well actually i, i think that um we now face um, a, a faux that is maybe the most dangerous we have faced since the battle of leponto. %$* 179
i guess he wants you to answer that. %$* 179
it’s time folks. %$* 577
and now um, ladies and gentlemen, it’s now time to vote. %$* 577
and – we vote and as they vote, you do closing. %$* 577
is that correct? %$* 577
yeah, don’t vote yet. %$* 32
as you vote, as they vote, you have your closing, okay? %$* 577
that’s the rule. %$* 577
so um, it’s time to vote. %$* 577
so um, if you want to vote for the motion, tear off “for” from the top, from the top, and put it in the ballot boxes that are going around. %$* 577
if you're against, tear off “against” and put it in the ballot box. %$* 577
if you're, um, undecided, put in the whole thing. %$* 577
if you need a voting ticket, the ushers will give it to you. %$* 577
uh, and while we’re doing this, uh, we’re having final remarks from the panelists. %$* 577
beginning with a side opposing the motion, the first person who’s going to speak will be robert walter. %$* 577
richard walter. %$* 579
i'm sorry, richard walter. %$* 577
i'm sorry, richard walter. %$* 577
now hollywood takes on corporations because it’s david and goliath. %$* 579
i have nothing against the corporations, i'm a free enterprise capitalist myself. %$* 579
and um, the reason they uh, these, these stories treat them the way they do is because it’s the little guy versus the, versus the big guy. %$* 579
nothing new about it at all. %$* 579
you know american film is world film. %$* 579
films made outside the united states, only one in ten will be shown outside the country of its origin, but all american films are shown outside the country of their origin. %$* 579
some as you know are, are shown only outside the country of their origin. %$* 579
that is to say, they can’t win domestic distribution deals and instead are released on cable and direct to video. %$* 579
what can explain this? %$* 579
the answer is the quality of american film and i also i believe the diversity of american films, the immigrant heritage of the american uh, nation and of the american film business in particular. %$* 579
when you look at american films, you’re looking at the world because you're seeing people of every race, of every creed, of every persuasion. %$* 579
american films are the single biggest export in the nation. %$* 579
they contribute more affirmatively to the reduction of the unfavorable balance of trade. %$* 579
they are a blessing upon us and should be celebrated by people who really love this country, who really consider them to be patriotic, rather than constantly besmirching them and caviling about them. %$* 579
richard walter. %$* 579
thank you. %$* 577
okay, for, roger kimball. %$* 577
well i remember when i was in uh, high school. %$* 578
my jesuit teachers would drum various things into us. %$* 578
and one saying they had was “never deny, seldom affirm, always distinguish.” it pains me to observe that the speakers against this motion tonight seem to be unable to appreciate that the motion does not say that hollywood causes anti-americanism. %$* 578
it is not a referendum on the bush administration or the war in iraq. %$* 578
it simply says that hollywood fuels anti-americanism abroad. %$* 578
it seems to me that um, my team has supplied numerous examples of how this, how this happens. %$* 578
and we could certainly spend the entire night providing examples. %$* 578
one of the people on the opposing side remarked on the remarkable outpouring sympathy for the united states in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.well i, i would, and then its quick evaporation. %$* 578
um i would say that that outpouring of sympathy was basically a version of sentimentality lodged upon the united states in its you know, unusual posture as victim. %$* 578
as soon as the united states began standing up for itself, that sympathy vanished. %$* 578
and i think that tells us a lot about the world opinion and how we can depend upon it. %$* 578
but in terms of hollywood which is really a mindset, as james hirsen said, it’s not just the movies. %$* 578
it’s really, we’re talking about a way of looking at the world, pop culture in general. %$* 578
i think this is a mindset that has given up on america in many ways, given up on those traditional virtues. %$* 578
james mentioned free enterprise but there are many other things. %$* 578
individual liberty, belief in the, in the future, really. %$* 578
and – roger. %$* 578
done? %$* 578
i will finish then, or stop. %$* 578
okay uh, against, robin. %$* 577
um i guess the only thing i can say is that if american movies uh, bred anti-american sentiment, i'm not sure why iran and north korea don’t have compulsory sunday matinees. %$* 581
uh, okay, for. %$* 577
joshua muravchick. %$* 577
uh, in her earlier remarks, robin said that there’s no scientific proof, no reliable study that hollywood is responsible for encouraging anti-american sentiment. %$* 580
that is absolutely true. %$* 580
there’s also no reliable study, no proof that any other factor whatsoever causes anti-americanism. %$* 580
we have this phenomenon of anti-americanism. %$* 580
there are many things that contribute to it. %$* 580
and uh, we, we don’t have any science of anti-americanism to tell us exactly which. %$* 580
i think common sense tells us that some, the kind of work of someone like michael moore which is so tremendously popular in europe contributes to that. %$* 580
and when we have robert talk about that house in moment after 9/11 when the world all loved us, uh, that moment was symbolized by a headline in le monde. %$* 580
which translated, said “we are all americans now.” and that was repeated here many times. %$* 580
however if you get le monde and read the essay, the essay was brimming with anti-americanism, saying you know this attack is a terrible thing but it’s what the americans deserved for the way they attempt to dominate the world. %$* 580
uh, and as for the likes of, of uh, oliver stone, i’d just like to share with you an anecdote. %$* 580
last year, i had the opportunity to attend a conference in ramallah. %$* 580
i was one of only two americans there. %$* 580
there were hundreds of palestinians talking among themselves. %$* 580
and one, hani al-hassan, who had been a member of arafat’s cabinet, gave the sort of keynote address, a history of the arab-israel conflict. %$* 580
and he said, in the early 1960s, president yasser wanted to end the conflict with israel so he sent a letter to president kennedy telling him how that could be done. %$* 580
president kennedy sent him back a letter saying, yes i agree, and this was all about to be consummated when the zionists assassinated kennedy. %$* 580
and uh, i sat there stunned in my seat, but how would i explain to young palestinians who have seen the, the likes of oliver stone’s uh, paranoid fantasies about what happened to kennedy, uh, that uh, hani al-hassan’s uh, it’s just implausible. %$* 580
joshua. %$* 577
thanks very much. %$* 577
against, robert greenwald. %$* 577
well it’s slightly off subject, but i want to know why josh was one of only two americans at this conference. %$* 583
now i am scared for our country and the impression they get, and have somebody over there who advocated for the war and wants us to bomb iran. %$* 583
but going back to the primary subject, lets not confuse bad movies or even critical movies. %$* 583
the assumption here is, if it’s a movie critical of something in the united states, therefore that will fuel anti-americans. %$* 583
not true, not accurate. %$* 583
to use jo-, to use josh’s words, common sense can tell us that many people all over the world and many people here have seen movies that are critical. %$* 583
that does not turn you into anti-american. %$* 583
and i would argue that the movies, the popular movies, the ones that are being seen in overwhelming numbers, as bernie helpfully provided this list, far outweigh – and if we go back to the, the woman’s question about fueling, you know i don't want to get into technical what is fuel and what’s not fuel. %$* 583
but lets say for a moment, titanic, star wars, e.t., that’s building tremendous goodwill which would and therefore there would be no fuel for the couple of incidents which might possibly, on a given day, encourage somebody to be against us. %$* 583
thank you. %$* 583
and for, james hirsen. %$* 577
please. %$* 577
um - james hirsen. %$* 577
yeah i mentioned uh, you know i, i live close to los angeles and i love hollywood, but i love america more. %$* 582
and uh, i’ll tell you, richard dreyfuss, who used to speak differently about america until he went on a campaign to teach civics and he read some himself, has called this country a miracle. %$* 582
and the innovations and advancements that we’ve had here were because of a system where for the very first time, rights and powers were viewed as implanted in individuals. %$* 582
and some of those were transferred, pursuant to a social contract we call the constitution, to a government. %$* 582
that had never happened before. %$* 582
um this motion is, is about free speech. %$* 582
and uh, to address an audience member who asked about responsibility today, the responsibility is greater for two reasons. %$* 582
one is because of what thomas freedman calls the flat earth. %$* 582
because hollywood exports more instantly, and two is because of the greater war. %$* 582
we were attacked in the city, it was the greatest attack on continental soil in our history. %$* 582
the greater war continues, even many of those who opposed the war in iraq are still cognizant of the fact that there is a war on terror. %$* 582
the reason i, i had asked you to vote for the motion was simply to raise awareness that this output of pop culture coming out of hollywood matters. %$* 582
and it’s not only for our domestic consumption, it’s being consumed by the world, it shapes the way they view us. %$* 582
and hollywood ought to use its power to help america prosper. %$* 582
i mean in that way, in the world’s eyes, they’d be a winner. %$* 582
well i, i want to thank the debaters and the audience for their good work. %$* 577
and before i announce the results of the audience voting, i want to take care of a few things. %$* 577
i would like to invite you all to return next year for the fifth intelligence squared us debate on wednesday, february 7 here at the asia society. %$* 577
the motion to be debated is “america is too damn religious.” the debate will be moderated by the co-director of the fordham center on religion and culture and the new york times columnist, peter steinfels. %$* 577

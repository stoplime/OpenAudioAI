so we always start each of our programs by bringing to the stage the chairman of intelligence squared u.s.who brought this program to the united states. %$* 13
he spends a couple of minutes kind of outlining why we're doing these debates, what we're looking forward to, and always brings a fresh insight to the topic. %$* 13
so please welcome to the stage mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
hi, bob. %$* 13
hi, john. %$* 1
how are you? %$* 13
so, bob, something that i don't think our audience knows is that you actually spent some time as an economist in your career. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 1
i was an economist at the rand corporation back many, many years ago, early in my career. %$* 1
so-- %$* 13
so can you help us-- %$* 13
you know, give us an image for-- %$* 13
for-- %$* 13
to hold onto to get through tonight's debate. %$* 13
well, i think the image is the image of a ladder, climbing the ladder of success in terms of one's income. %$* 1
and the ladder of success has moved over time in a couple of ways. %$* 1
but the rungs have certainly gotten further and further apart so that the very top of the ladder, the top 1 percent, the top 1/10 of one percent has a much bigger share of the national income than it did, say, 20 or 30 years ago. %$* 1
and the middle rungs of the ladder, frankly haven't moved all that much. %$* 1
so this is a very visceral topic. %$* 13
it's not purely academic. %$* 13
why-- %$* 13
why does it connect to people so strongly? %$* 13
well, i think the-- %$* 1
first of all, before i get to that, let me just say that this debate, in a sense, is not about whether the ladder is as i've described it. %$* 1
but it's about the difficulty or ease of moving from one rung of the ladder to the next and getting to the top of that ladder or the upper rungs of the ladder. %$* 1
the mobility question. %$* 13
the mobility question. %$* 1
and this debate is not about anything other than, has this increase in inequality, the widening of the rungs of the ladder made it more and more difficult for people to climb that ladder, or is it really neutral on-- %$* 1
on that dimension? %$* 1
and again, why-- %$* 13
why does this grab people beyond the academic world? %$* 13
well, i think it grabs people because it's been so much in the public consciousness. %$* 1
and i'd say there are really three sort of views out there about what it is that's powered this top 1 percent or-- %$* 1
or above. %$* 1
and one of the views is that it's very benign, that it's a process, a normal process of capitalist economies, that you have companies like apple and google and facebook that have provided goods and services that we all need, that we all use. %$* 1
and the extraordinarily creative entrepreneurs behind those companies have been very richly rewarded, and there's nothing wrong with that. %$* 1
so that's kind of one mindset. %$* 1
another mindset is that a lot of it is luck. %$* 1
and the kind of luck people are talking about is the luck of where you're born, the luck of how your-- %$* 1
your parents' economic situation, the luck of your race and ethnicity, the luck of how many iq points you've got, frankly. %$* 1
so there's some-- %$* 1
some people who feel like the primary determinant of where you are on that ladder is luck. %$* 1
and there are other people who take a more draconian view that people have gotten to the top of the ladder in mean-- %$* 1
through means that are not legitimate. %$* 1
crony capitalism, where they've gotten the government to subsidize their particular business or activity, are protected with tariffs, or in the case of the big bankers who got huge bonuses and then had to be bailed out by the taxpayer. %$* 1
and got bailed out. %$* 13
and did get bailed out. %$* 1
so you-- %$* 1
you have three very different and competing visions of-- %$* 1
of what it is that propelled people to the top of that ladder and therefore different visions of the legitimacy of the system. %$* 1
so, i mean,-- %$* 13
and there's also just the fact that all of us have a place on the ladder. %$* 13
i mean, on this stage, there are two guys, and one of them is higher up the ladder than the other one. %$* 13
how's the view from up there, bob? %$* 13
well, you know, john, i thought i'd wear faded jeans and a t-shirt and try to disguise that, but then i thought, why not be honest and wear my english suit? %$* 1
well, you look very smart. %$* 13
and let's thank bob rosenkranz on the stage. %$* 13
and let's bring out-- %$* 13
let's bring out our smart debaters. %$* 13
let's welcome them to the stage. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, our debaters. %$* 13
and i just want to invite one more round of applause for bob rosenkranz for making all this possible. %$* 13
hello again from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we use the word "dream" sometimes to mean almost completely opposite things. %$* 13
we use "dream" to describe an aspiration for something that can be if we try hard enough, "dream a little dream," "i have a dream."but we also use it in the opposite way to describe something that just is so impossible to get that it's ridiculous to try. %$* 13
you know, "dream on, buddy," "dream on," "in your dreams." so, what about people who are partway down the ladder of success in america and their american dream? %$* 13
given that 40 percent of america's wealth, up to 40 percent, and up to 20 percent of its income is in the hands of the legendary 1 percent, does the dreamer on the ladder still have a chance to climb or should he or she simply dream on? %$* 13
well, that sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it, yes or no to this statement, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are at the kaufman music center in new york city. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility."as always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then the live audience here in new york will vote to choose the winner, and only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion, again, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility." let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome elise gould. %$* 13
and, elise, you're a senior economist and director of health policy research at the economic policy institute. %$* 13
and one of the topics you study there is wages. %$* 13
and you have a calculator on your website, i'm told about-- %$* 13
i haven't been to it yet-- %$* 13
but it shows what your wages would be today if they had actually kept up with productivity, so that $40,000 today really should be something closer to $60,000. thatâ€™s about right? %$* 13
yes. %$* 585
so when that was posted on the website, did everybody at the institute ask for a raise? %$* 13
well, not immediately, john, but we economists really know how to bring the facts to the table when we start bargaining over wages. %$* 585
and you'll be bringing some facts tonight. %$* 13
yes, absolutely. %$* 585
ladies and gentlemen, elise gould. %$* 13
can i just ask to have my ifb be lowered significantly? %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
that's a technical term. %$* 13
it's on a need to know basis. %$* 13
don't worry, i am not going to explode, i don't think. %$* 13
elise, tell us who your partner is. %$* 13
my partner is the charming and resourceful nick hanauer. %$* 585
ladies and gentlemen, nick hanauer, please welcome him. %$* 13
nick, you are also arguing for the motion, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility." you are a-- %$* 13
let's just say it-- %$* 13
you are clearly a 1 percenter. %$* 13
you're a venture capitalist. %$* 13
way back in the '90s you made an investment in a little company called amazon.com. %$* 13
it worked out. %$* 13
you recently wrote a memo to, as you put it, your "fellow zillionaires," where you warned them that these high and historically high inequality is not only self-defeating, that it's transforming us into a feudal society. %$* 13
how did your fellow zillionaires respond to that? %$* 13
well, i live in seattle, washington, and i reckon you have to go all the way to texas to find a serious and intelligent wealthy person who doesn't agree that rising inequality is something that we need to-- %$* 586
that we need to address. %$* 586
yeah, thank you, nick hanauer. %$* 13
that's our team arguing for the motion, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and we have two debaters arguing against the motion, which, once again, is "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility." please welcome ed conard. %$* 13
ed, you are a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute, former partner at bain capital. %$* 13
that makes you also a 1 percenter. %$* 13
you-- %$* 13
author of this book, "unintended consequences, why everything you've been told about the economy is wrong," in which you actually explain how society benefits from the wealthy. %$* 13
ahead of publication on this, you were profiled in the new york times. %$* 13
and you predicted-- %$* 13
i mean, the article predicted that this could be the most hated book of the year. %$* 13
was it, ed conard? %$* 13
only in my wildest dreams do i have that much impact on the national debate. %$* 587
well-- %$* 13
see what happens after tonight's debate. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ed conard. %$* 13
and, ed, your partner is? %$* 13
scott winship, formerly a renowned poverty scholar, formerly on the left, now on the right. %$* 587
he's examined the data for quite some time and he's gradually come to the other side of the divide. %$* 587
ladies and gentlemen, scott winship. %$* 13
scott, as your partner just said, you're also arguing against the motion that "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility." and as he pointed out you're at the manhattan institute, and a-- %$* 13
you know, a relatively conservative think tank, but you were once part of acorn, the liberal community-organizing group. %$* 13
and you're editor-- %$* 13
managing editor of the democratic strategist. %$* 13
so, being at the manhattan institute now, with that background, how-- %$* 13
how do you describe yourself? %$* 13
i suppose i'm a liberal-tarian. %$* 588
i donâ€™t know, my mom describes me as handsome. %$* 588
well-- %$* 13
just to tell the radio audience, it's entirely true. %$* 13
scott winship, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
and our team arguing against the motion. %$* 13
now, to remind you, this is a debate. %$* 13
it's a contest. %$* 13
one team will win and one team will lose. %$* 13
and that decision will be made by our live audience here in new york. %$* 13
by the time the audience-- %$* 13
by the time the debaters have completed debating, this audience will have voted twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
and the way we determine victory is the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms between the two debates, between the two votes. %$* 13
so, let's have you go to the keypads at your seat and register your first vote. %$* 13
once again, our motion is this: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push #1. if you disagree with this motion, push #2. or if you're undecided-- %$* 13
which is a perfectly reasonable starting position-- %$* 13
push #3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they are not live tonight. %$* 13
and if you make a mistake in your vote, you can just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's got that done. %$* 13
and to remind you, we'll have you vote again right after you hear the-- %$* 13
the closing round of the debate, and again, to remind you that it's the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes that will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, we go in three rounds. %$* 13
and let's get on to round 1.our motion is this: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here to speak first for the motion, elise gould. %$* 13
she is senior economist and director of health policy at the economic policy institute, one of the top-- %$* 13
oh, i've already said all of that. %$* 13
you can say it again. %$* 585
i-- %$* 13
i may well end up saying it all again, but i just want to be briefer this time. %$* 13
but you are very, very generous to give me that opportunity. %$* 13
elise gould is a senior economist and director of health policy research at the economic policy institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, elise gould. %$* 13
thank you so much for inviting me to share my research and knowledge about the question at hand. %$* 585
we are debating whether income inequality hampers the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 585
and i'm here to tell you that it does. %$* 585
nick hanauer and i hope to convince you that as income inequality has increased, the american dream has been harder to achieve. %$* 585
if we think-- %$* 585
as you've already heard already, the same analogy-- %$* 585
if we think of income distribution as rungs on the ladder, and upward mobility-- %$* 585
or mobility in general-- %$* 585
is movements up and down the ladder, common sense tells you if the rungs get further apart, the ladder is going to be harder to climb. %$* 585
let's start with the first part of the proposition. %$* 585
research from a multitude of government and academic sources have indisputably found that income inequality has increased over the last generation. %$* 585
that is an established fact. %$* 585
the tremendous growth in income inequality comes at a cost to individuals, to families, and to society as a whole. %$* 585
we know from research that rising income inequality has not helped grow the size of the economy, and has likely even harmed growth. %$* 585
this makes the rise in inequality a zero sum game at best. %$* 585
since inequality means that the larger shares are flowing to the top, middle, and bottom-- %$* 585
the middle and bottom continue to get squeezed. %$* 585
those consequences aside, the one cost we're discussing today is reduced access to the american dream. %$* 585
the american dream itself is a somewhat elusive concept. %$* 585
it's one of those you know it when you see it sort of things. %$* 585
to some it means the happiness of a normal, stable life. %$* 585
not falling behind every year. %$* 585
it means a good job and a great future for your children. %$* 585
it means that if your kids work hard, they will find success. %$* 585
working hard is the backbone of the american dream. %$* 585
to know that your kids have the opportunity to do well, it is only for them to grab it, to seize the day. %$* 585
the most common concept economists use to measure upward mobility is intergenerational mobility. %$* 585
this is the extent to which your parents' economic position determines your position in adulthood. %$* 585
if your position on the earnings, income, or wealth scale is largely a function of your birth, then even the most talented coming from the lower rungs of society will have a hard time achieving success. %$* 585
conversely, little correlation between parents and children means that one's economic fate can be directly determined through intelligence and hard work. %$* 585
so how do we raise the economic mobility of the u.s. today? %$* 585
well, one way is to look at how we compare to other countries. %$* 585
another way is to look at, historically, what has happened with mobility and discuss the pathways through which mobility is affected by opportunity. %$* 585
the fact that one's economic position in childhood determines one's position in adulthood more so in the u.s.than in many advanced countries. %$* 585
we have less mobility here than in denmark, norway, finland, sweden. %$* 585
we have less mobility than australia, japan, new zealand, germany, spain, france. %$* 585
let me talk for a moment about our peer to the north, canada. %$* 585
canada actually looks a lot like us, both in economic regime and in its diversity. %$* 585
but family background is twice as important in determining children's success in the u.s.than in canada. %$* 585
furthermore, among our peers, we are the most unequal society, and we have seen the greatest growth in inequality. %$* 585
janet yellen recently reiterated the fact that lower economic mobility is found in countries with higher income inequality. %$* 585
so, the american dream is more likely elsewhere than here and more likely in more unequal societies. %$* 585
now, what's happened over time? %$* 585
the truth is that research on mobility has a few years before it can catch up to answer more definitively on this question. %$* 585
we have to wait until the children born in the most unequal times, let's say the last decade, until they grow up, and we can see, we can measure their incomes and their earnings. %$* 585
so far, high quality research has shown that economic mobility has been stagnant or declining over the last generation. %$* 585
even so, it's impossible to know what the counter factual is. %$* 585
perhaps the society got richer, economic mobility would have increased. %$* 585
so, finding stagnant mobility really doesn't answer the question. %$* 585
what is entirely clear and is known that income inequality leads to inequality of opportunity and resources, and this surely hampers mobility. %$* 585
when growing inequality means that poor kids don't get the proper nutrition they need or the glasses when they need them, then it's obvious they can't do as well in school. %$* 585
opportunity for many often looks like education. %$* 585
over time, high-income parents are-- %$* 585
are making increasingly larger and larger investments in their children. %$* 585
and that's a good thing. %$* 585
but lower income families simply cannot afford to make those same investments. %$* 585
we've seen low income families increasing their investments from the 1970s to the 2000s, from about $835 per kid to about $1,300.at the same time, over that same period, high income families' investments went from 3,500 to nearly $9,000.and those investments pay off. %$* 585
it may come as no surprise that more affluent students score better on standardized tests. %$* 585
a recent study actually renamed the scholastic aptitude test the student affluent test. %$* 585
those with higher family income who tend to be college educated allow parents to live in neighborhoods with better schools and pay for private schools. %$* 585
and it's a self-reinforcing cycle. %$* 585
this provides a direct link between growing inequality, growing gaps in opportunity and declining mobility. %$* 585
over this period of growing income inequality, college graduation rates have become increasingly unequal. %$* 585
both groups, the top and the bottom, have seen higher college graduation rates than before. %$* 585
but the bottom only increased by 4 percent while the top increased by almost 20 percentage points. %$* 585
what is even more troubling for society that defends the reality of the american dream is that low-scoring, high-income students are more likely to graduate from college than high-scoring, low-income students. %$* 585
that is, by definition, not about ability. %$* 585
it is about income. %$* 585
everyone can't be in the top 1 percent. %$* 585
and we can all name stories of children who did succeed against all odds. %$* 585
but it's "against the all odds" part that we're here to talk about today. %$* 585
has living in an increasingly unequal society made it harder to climb the rungs of the ladder? %$* 585
unambiguously, the answer is yes. %$* 585
thank you, elise gould. %$* 13
and that is our motion income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here to speak against the motion, scott winship. %$* 13
he is the walter b.wriston fellow at the manhattan institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome scott winship. %$* 13
well, thank you, john, and thanks to iq squared and to the rosenkranz foundation for sponsoring this debate, but also for creating a way to combat the polarization that i think itâ€™s really been poisoning a lot of our discourse the last few years. %$* 588
and in that spirit, let me just start by noting a few areas where there's agreement i think with what elise just said. %$* 588
first, i agree that there is a lot of income inequality in the united states. %$* 588
there's-- %$* 588
frankly, there's a lot of income inequality on this stage. %$* 588
like elise, i'm also deeply concerned about inequality of opportunity. %$* 588
i can tell you that i became interested in these issues on april 29th, 1992 when the l.a.riots erupted during my freshman year of college. %$* 588
i believed then and still believe that-- %$* 588
that poor children enjoy far too little upward mobility. %$* 588
what do i mean by that? %$* 588
kids with the poorest parents tend, disproportionately, to end up among the poorest adults as well. %$* 588
where i part ways with my opponents, and by the way, with my 19-year- old self, is that after a brief career in community organizing, after a not at all brief period in getting my phd in harvard's inequality and social policy program, after managing the research agenda for the pew economic mobility project and continuing to study these issues at brookings and now at the manhattan institute, after all of this, i-- %$* 588
i've concluded that if you're, like me, concerned about inequality of opportunity, focusing on inequality of incomes is just misguided. %$* 588
so, my partner, ed, and i are asking you to oppose the motion on the table. %$* 588
whatever you think of the state of the american dream, income inequality does not impair it. %$* 588
okay. %$* 588
so, elise and i are going to disagree on a few things. %$* 588
in my mind, if-- %$* 588
if income inequality were impairing the american dream of upward mobility, you ought to see two things jump out at you in the very big literature that we've got on this question. %$* 588
the first thing you would expect to see is that over the period where inequality was growing in the united states, that you would see falling upward mobility. %$* 588
now, the-- %$* 588
the consensus from a dozen studies on this question is easily summarized by the conclusion from the most recent paper that came to this conclusion. %$* 588
and i'll just quote: it found that mobility has remained remarkably stable over the second half of the 20th century in the united states. %$* 588
that finding is from berkeley's emmanuel saez who, along with thomas piketty, who's the most famous economist of the year for sure. %$* 588
they're the two who develops the top 1 percent estimates that we all have seen everywhere. %$* 588
so, that's his conclusion. %$* 588
the second conclusion you would expect to see is, if high inequality impairs upward mobility, is that places with a lot of inequality would have lower mobility. %$* 588
and you heard elise mention that the u.s.has less mobility than other countries. %$* 588
that was certainly the conventional wisdom i would argue until this year. %$* 588
in a paper published this year, a canadian economist named miles corak, who had originated this thing called "the great gatsby curve," that some of you might have heard of, that janet yellen talked about in her speech. %$* 588
earlier this year, his most recent paper highlights real serious problems with that chart and the previous research. %$* 588
what he did in this newest paper is to team up with an american economist and a swedish economist. %$* 588
and the three of them looked at their own countries, compared mobility across them, were very careful to measure them comparably, and they found, quote, "we find almost no differences in upward mobility between canada, sweden and the united states."meanwhile, saezâ€™s team, in a second study this past year, found that developed countries with higher income concentration have mobility rates that are no lower than countries that are low inequality. %$* 588
and they found the same thing to be true of american counties. %$* 588
okay. %$* 588
my opponents want you to believe that if the top 1 percent hadn't made as much in the past 35 years, that the bottom and the middle would have made more, that they pay an inequality tax you sometimes hear. %$* 588
but research again finds that in rich countries, those that experience bigger increases in inequality, have experienced bigger income gains at the bottom and in the middle, not smaller. %$* 588
now, how can that be? %$* 588
well, ed is going to talk to you about the research on inequality and economic growth. %$* 588
we disagree, i think, with our opponents on that as well. %$* 588
but essentially, the research finds that countries with more inequality actually experience more economic growth. %$* 588
so, essentially if you enlarge the pie enough, the economic pie enough, then the poor and middle class actually can get more pie even if their slice becomes skinnier. %$* 588
if you claim that absent rising inequality, the middle class would have had thousands of dollars more than they did, as you sometimes hear, there are a couple of really big assumptions hidden behind that. %$* 588
one is that if we had capped the incomes at the top, that the economic pie would have become just as big as it actually did. %$* 588
the second assumption is that if we had capped those incomes, then essentially the proceeds would be equally distributed across the population. %$* 588
now, in actuality, if we somehow managed to cap the incomes of the top 1 percent, what would likely happen is we'd be shifting incomes to knowledge workers and professionals who are in the upper middle class or in the rest of the top 10 percent. %$* 588
to see how important these assumptions actually are, consider one possible outcome if we had successfully held the top 1 percentâ€™s income share in 2007 to their 1979 level, okay? %$* 588
so assume, for sake of argument, that, that would have reduced economic growth, not by a lot, say, by 8 percent. %$* 588
and assume that the middle 20 percent, instead of receiving 20 percent of the proceeds from this redistribution, got 13 percent of the proceeds. %$* 588
well, i've done the math, and what it works out to is that in this scenario the middle class actually would be no better off for having limited the increases at the top. %$* 588
so, i think that's against our intuition. %$* 588
but it's, nevertheless, the case. %$* 588
so, as you listen to the arguments from the other side, i hope you continue to ask yourself, as i have, that if income inequality hurts opportunity, why is it so hard to find that link when you look across time and look over space? %$* 588
the answer is that the motion on the table that "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility," is intuitive but wrong. %$* 588
and that's why you should vote against it. %$* 588
thank you. %$* 588
thank you, scott winship. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through this opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility." you have heard from the first two debaters, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the lectern nick hanauer. %$* 13
he is a cofounder and partner at the venture capital firm, second avenue partners, and author of the book, "the gardens of democracy." ladies and gentlemen, nick hanauer. %$* 13
let me start tonight by sharing some irs data. %$* 586
in 1980, the top 1 percent of americans shared 8.46 percent of national income. %$* 586
by 2007, it had risen to 22.86 percent. %$* 586
during the same time, the bottom 50 percent of americans' share of national income fell from 17.68 percent to 12.19.during the same period, the income share of the top 1/10th of 1 percent of americans rose to 12 percent, equaling the share of the bottom 50 percent of americans combined. %$* 586
and then in 2008-- %$* 586
remember, 2007, before, those were the good old days-- %$* 586
things went really bad for the american middle class. %$* 586
the distance an american child needs to go to get from the bottom to the top in our society is staggering. %$* 586
ceos used to make 30 times the median wage now earn 300 to 500 times. %$* 586
if the irs data that i just quoted you is not persuasive to you, does not persuade you that the distance from the top to the bottom is larger-- %$* 586
perhaps 10 times larger, then almost nothing elise and i can say tonight will persuade you. %$* 586
according to scott, this economic inequality and its impact on mobility is a fiction. %$* 586
the anguish felt by millions of ordinary working middle class americans is a consequence of a misconception. %$* 586
they are simply confused about the data. %$* 586
perhaps. %$* 586
but there are two fundamentally different arguments inequality deniers make. %$* 586
the first is that it doesn't exist. %$* 586
the second is that it exists but it's actually really, really good for the economy and the middle class. %$* 586
this argument is equally false, but at least it seems plausible. %$* 586
the idea, of course, is that when the rich get richer, that's good for the economy and for the middle class, and for mobility. %$* 586
and anything we do to make the poor richer by definition harms the economy and mobility. %$* 586
and this, of course, is the trickledown economics lie. %$* 586
but ed-- %$* 586
ed and i do agree on one thing, and that is that innovation is essential to a growing economy and that capitalism needs some inequality to create incentives for people to innovate and to take risk. %$* 586
the question for the house tonight is, is extreme inequality necessary, and should we have more and more of it every year? %$* 586
capitalism needs inequality to grow, just like plants need water to grow. %$* 586
but in precisely the same way that too much water kills plants by drowning them, too much income inequality kills capitalism by drowning the middle class. %$* 586
raging inequality is drowning the middle class and killing the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 586
ed and other inequality apologists present us with a false choice-- %$* 586
extreme and rising inequality is necessary to create adequate incentives for innovation and risk-taking, and that without these extreme incentives, it will all disappear. %$* 586
he will tell you that anything we do to blunt inequality, like raising the taxes on the rich or improving labor standards for the poor, to increase wages-- %$* 586
will kill the economy and mobility. %$* 586
this is utter nonsense. %$* 586
bill gates, steve jobs, sam walton-- %$* 586
they all started their companies when taxes were twice as high as they are today. %$* 586
theoretically, with half the incentive. %$* 586
did they make some sort of cosmic mistake? %$* 586
almost two years ago, taxes on capital gains went up 25 percent, theoretically quartering the incentive. %$* 586
but from where i sit as a technology venture capitalist on the west coast, the rate of innovation is increasing, not decreasing. %$* 586
silicon valley is more on fire, not less. %$* 586
the stock market, since then, has gone from 12,000 to almost 17,000.clearly, people are responding to incentives, just not the ones ed thinks. %$* 586
the biggest incentive in a market economy is the market size. %$* 586
and the more money most people have-- %$* 586
in other words, the less inequality we have-- %$* 586
the bigger the opportunity and the bigger the incentives are to invest and innovate. %$* 586
ed will tell you that the american economy has outperformed all others because of our extreme inequality. %$* 586
if you are a partner at bain or someone like me, that feels like it could be true, but it is not on a per capita basis. %$* 586
our economy has performed roughly the same, on a growth basis, as most other industrial countries. %$* 586
1.7 to 1.9 percent. %$* 586
the difference, of course, is what life is like for the typical family. %$* 586
thirty years ago, the american middle class was undisputedly the most prosperous and mobile of any society. %$* 586
today, that is not true. %$* 586
today, by every measure, the-- %$* 586
the canadian middle class is more prosperous than ours. %$* 586
ed and his trickle down ilk believe that capital is all that matters, but we are awash in capital. %$* 586
american companies are currently sitting on $2 trillion worth of cash. %$* 586
at the same time, the cost to innovate has fallen exponentially. %$* 586
it took a million dollars to start amazon.com. %$* 586
in our economy, growth is dependent on how many innovators and consumers we include in the economy. %$* 586
the economy isn't the bank accounts of the rich. %$* 586
it is the dynamic feedback loop between sellers and buyers. %$* 586
this means that the more people we include in our economy as robust innovators and affluent consumers, the faster it grows and the bigger it gets. %$* 586
but clearly and most obviously, high and growing rates of inequality don't help that. %$* 586
they hinder it by excluding more and more people as sellers and buyers. %$* 586
and at the end of the day, that's why rising inequality is terrible for the economy and for the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 586
when people are excluded by inequality, it destroys innovation. %$* 586
it destroys consumption. %$* 586
and it destroys mobility. %$* 586
rising inequality is literally drowning the middle class and killing the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 586
thank you. %$* 586
thank you. %$* 13
nick hanauer. %$* 13
and that is our motion: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and here as our final debater against the motion, in this opening round, to argue against it, ed conard. %$* 13
he is author of the book "unintended consequences: why everything you've been told about the economy is wrong." and he's a former partner at bain capital. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ed conard. %$* 13
i almost feel like i don't have to speak. %$* 587
nick said it all for me. %$* 587
but nick pushes you off what this debate is really about. %$* 587
it's whether income inequality impairs mobility. %$* 587
and if it did, there'd be telltale signs that nick wants to overlook. %$* 587
the first is that we've seen a lot of growing inequality. %$* 587
but all the evidence says mobility has not declined. %$* 587
weâ€™ve transferred more to the poor. %$* 587
that should increase mobility. %$* 587
it hasn't. %$* 587
economies with more equally distributed incomes should have more mobility. %$* 587
they don't. %$* 587
we've spent more on education. %$* 587
that should significantly increase our test scores. %$* 587
it hasn't. %$* 587
so-- %$* 587
can i interrupt you just for the radio. %$* 13
can you stand with-- %$* 13
with sort of right up to the mic because-- %$* 13
closer? %$* 587
yeah. %$* 13
all right. %$* 18
do you want him to start over? %$* 13
no. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so, just proceed so that it's a cleaner signal. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i thought it was-- %$* 587
i thought it was a little loud so, i was backing up. %$* 587
and fortunately, we're using up all of your time. %$* 13
it counts against you this whole conversation, so-- %$* 13
no, i can â€“ i see whatâ€™s happened with the clock. %$* 13
we stopped it, and you will get your full allotment. %$* 13
you're on. %$* 13
okay. %$* 587
so we may not have found a way to increase mobility, but we have found a way to increase the living standards of the poor, and that's by growing our economy. %$* 587
so this debate really isn't about whether income inequality impairs mobility. %$* 587
even emmanuel saez of the liberal piketty-saez duo admits that the chances of a low-income child reaching any higher level of income has increased. %$* 587
the rungs have gotten wider. %$* 587
you can still climb the rungs even though they're wild-- %$* 587
wider. %$* 587
this debate is really about whether the success of america's top earners hurts the middle and working class. %$* 587
now, our opponents see the pie, the economy as a pie to be divided. %$* 587
they believe that steve jobs' success reduces the income of everybody else. %$* 587
the more he gets, the less everybody else gets. %$* 587
we see his success as growing the economy and the demand for labor. %$* 587
now, it's true, productivity's grown faster than median wages. %$* 587
our opponents see this as evidence that lesser skilled employees no longer share in the success of our economy. %$* 587
they overlook the fact that growth can manifest itself in two ways: where the supply of labor is restricted like it was in the 1950s and '60s, it'll drive up wages. %$* 587
but where the supply of labor is unrestricted like it is today, it'll drive up employment. %$* 587
the baby boom, the increased participation of women in the work force, immigration and growing trade deficits have created an enormous increase in supply in labor. %$* 587
and as a result, employment grew instead of wages. %$* 587
u.s. employment has grown 50 percent since 1980, twice as fast as germany and france, three times faster than japan. %$* 587
two to three times faster is an unheard of difference in performance. %$* 587
this difference has been even greater-- %$* 587
it would have been-- %$* 587
it was even greater because the other countries have shared in the disproportionate benefit of american innovation. %$* 587
and america has achieved this employment growth at median incomes that are 20 to 30 percent higher than germany, france, and japan. %$* 587
because of this growth, today, america's home to 37 million adult immigrants. %$* 587
there are 16 million native-born children, and all the children of those 53 million adults. %$* 587
so perhaps wages would have grown faster in the supply of labor had been more restricted. %$* 587
but it's disingenuous to close one eye, ignore america's extraordinary employment growth relative to its peers, and claim that income inequality hurts the middle and the working class. %$* 587
no other economy has done more to help the middle class and working poor than the u.s. economy. %$* 587
and that's why you should vote against the motion that income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 587
to persuade you that the success of america's top earners subtracts from everyone else's income, our opponents will claim that successful americans use cronyism to misappropriate their earnings. %$* 587
if these americans had misallocated the amount of resources that are necessary to achieve their success, growth would have slowed relative to other economies with more equally distributed income. %$* 587
the opposite occurred. %$* 587
america's growth accelerated relative to its peers. %$* 587
rising cronyism can't explain the faster growth of the united states. %$* 587
and that's not to say there isn't cronyism. %$* 587
there is. %$* 587
but the status quo is under assault from innovation more than it's ever been. %$* 587
the turnover of ceos, fortune 500 companies, and forbes 400 wealthiest americans have all accelerated. %$* 587
that's a far cry from crony capitalism. %$* 587
and it wasn't crony capitalism that produced america's success. %$* 587
it was hard work and entrepreneurial risk taking. %$* 587
nick's right. %$* 587
information technology made our knowledge workers more productive, and it opened up a large window of low- cost investment opportunities. %$* 587
and this increased the productivity and pay of our most talented workers and gave rise to a growing number of successful entrepreneurs. %$* 587
americans were uniquely successful at capitalizing on these opportunities. %$* 587
their growth didn't hurt america. %$* 587
it made us stronger. %$* 587
so, to avoid debating the truth, nick went down this path. %$* 587
our opponents will retreat to a more ambiguous claim, that perhaps we could have raised living standards even more if we'd attack success more heavily. %$* 587
even if that's true, upward mobility has not been impaired. %$* 587
and therefore you should vote against the motion. %$* 587
and even if you believe that higher taxes distribute more income to the middle class than they destroy, you should at least recognize that there's very little evidence supporting this highly speculative claim. %$* 587
in the real world, germany, france, and japan all distributed income more equally, and none of them produced faster employment growth than america, nor, despite more restricted supplies of labor, did they grow their median incomes faster than the united states since the early 1990s. %$* 587
in the academic world, there have been no less than six highly regarded cross country studies on the effect of income inequality on growth, by economists at harvard, mit, the oecd, the world bank, the imf.all of them have reached the same conclusion: inequality accelerates growth in high-wage economies. %$* 587
the imf's most recent study, whose headlines insisted that redistribution does not slow growth, admitted, redistribution above the 75 percentile is indeed harmful to growth as the okun big tradeoff suggests. %$* 587
guess which country's at the 75th percentile? %$* 587
the united states. %$* 587
another of these studies also conditions the okun big tradeoff and found that by 2001, the growth-promoting effects of inequality had pushed the income of the bottom 90 percent above what it would have been if their share of income hadn't fallen. %$* 587
so even if this briefly stated evidence fails to persuade you, it doesn't mean that the success of our top earners hurts america. %$* 587
quite the contrary. %$* 587
not only has america's much faster growth created employment for tens of millions of additional workers at much higher median wages than other â€“ and median incomes-- %$* 587
than other high-wage economies, it has improved every capable child's chances of earning a higher standard of living. %$* 587
even emmanuel saez agrees. %$* 587
so, please, don't succumb to our opponentsâ€™ divisive politics. %$* 587
even if you support higher taxes, the success of america's top earners is an asset, not a liability. %$* 587
vote against the motion that success impairs upward mobility. %$* 587
thank you, ed conard. %$* 13
and that is our motion income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
and that concludes round one. %$* 13
now we move on to round two in our debate. %$* 13
round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in the audience. %$* 13
a reminder of where we are. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion: income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility. %$* 13
we have heard the team arguing for the motion, elise gould and nick hanauer say, you know, some inequality is built into the system, and some inequality is even a spur to innovation. %$* 13
but a point comes where it becomes too much, and it can actually kill the american dream. %$* 13
they talked about how low income families cannot invest in their kids' futures. %$* 13
that if you can't buy eyeglasses for the kid in school, then the kid's not going to do well in school, and his opportunity will be limited. %$* 13
they say, basically, using the image of a ladder, that if the rungs are spread farther apart than they ever have been before and the top is higher than it's ever been before that intuitively, it becomes much more difficult to climb, that the distance from the bottom to the top has become staggering. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, scott winship and ed conard also acknowledge that there is a lot of-- %$* 13
also acknowledge that there is a lot of income inequality, but they say that is not the cause of a loss in upward mobility in the united states. %$* 13
they say compared to other nations where income is much flatter, that the united states has greater mobility. %$* 13
they cite a number of studies that have looked at this and have crunched the numbers, comparing income inequality with the mobility and they find that there is no meaningful relationship and that the downward pressure on wages in the united states, which they acknowledge is real, has other causes. %$* 13
but they say the success of the top earners in america is not to blame for america's problems. %$* 13
so, i found it interesting that scott winship, who is arguing against the motion, said that the motion as phrased, income inequality impairs the american dream of upward mobility, sounds intuitively correct, but is factually wrong. %$* 13
and i want to go to elise gould who's arguing for the motion and-- %$* 13
and your opponent's point is that the studies show us something that's not intuitively correct. %$* 13
and you're the economist, and you're the one who knows the studies. %$* 13

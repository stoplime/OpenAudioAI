so it's not with a lot of strain, but i think they are becoming-- %$* 212
striving to have markets more like ours rather than us looking to europe as a model. %$* 212
we also have the huge advantage of having one language. %$* 212
would this side like to respond, no? %$* 13
the migration policy-- %$* 210
bryan caplan. %$* 13
of the european union has been fantastic. %$* 210
my only complaint is that they keep out most poor countries. %$* 210
okay. %$* 13
all the way in the back there. %$* 13
and a mic will come up to you. %$* 13
do you mind standing out in-- %$* 13
would you actually-- %$* 13
because you're in shadow from my perspective which probably means you are for the camera-- %$* 13
just to come down about six steps until you're-- %$* 13
great, that's great, thank you. %$* 13
okay. %$* 19
so people want-- %$* 19
okay, your name-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
tiffany turantina so people want to come to america because they want to prosper, right? %$* 19
and i think three of you, all but bryan, have mentioned that there needs to be a minimum wage but we don't have one. %$* 19
so if the politicians are not going to vote for one or if we don't know if they're going to vote for one, how can we today vote and say, "yes," that we want everyone to be able to come in and work in here? %$* 19
okay, that's actually not a minimum wage question, that's the question-- %$* 13
what you're asking is "why-- %$* 13
" this side is arguing that "we'll work it out," and you're asking, "how can we trust-- %$* 13
correct. %$* 19
"-- %$* 13
the system to work it out-- %$* 13
and vote to-- %$* 19
the system to work it out. %$* 13
and though today-- %$* 19
a fair question. %$* 13
in this hypothetical, what-if world we're talking about, what is your confidence level that the kinds of protections that you're saying would need to be built in could actually be built in? %$* 13
we already have those protections. %$* 211
we have employer laws. %$* 211
we have the laws for sick leave. %$* 211
we have employer laws for maternity. %$* 211
we have laws for health care. %$* 211
we have a minimum wage. %$* 211
let's just tweak it a little bit and now move on. %$* 211
it's not that-- %$* 211
it's not rocket science. %$* 211
but-- %$* 13
you can applaud that. %$* 13
i don't want-- %$* 13
mean to suppress your-- %$* 13
this applause. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 13
i thought that this-- %$* 13
the flow of the argument was, though, that the cost of supplying those services to large numbers of people-- %$* 13
your opponents are arguing-- %$* 13
could be prohibitive. %$* 13
we're talking about as many-- %$* 211
employees as employers need. %$* 211
and we're not talking about billions of people. %$* 211
we're talking about reasonable numbers of people coming here, taking jobs when they're offered jobs. %$* 211
i don't-- %$* 211
you know, there's no-- %$* 211
i don't see why we keep talking about billions coming in. %$* 211
we-- %$* 211
no one is saying, "just open the borders and let people come here, and live, and we have to give them health care.‚Äù we're saying that if there's a job here for them, let them take the job. %$* 211
that's-- %$* 211
it's as simple as that. %$* 211
i don't know why we even have to debate this. %$* 211
it's a simple argument. %$* 211
if an employer wants it-- %$* 211
ron unz. %$* 13
here's the problem. %$* 213
i mean, the practical world-- %$* 213
obviously, people are self-interested. %$* 213
and they try to game the system. %$* 213
let's say, for example, we convert our immigration policy, our job labor policy entirely to the control of employers. %$* 213
right now, for example, illegal immigrants pay thousands of dollars to be smuggled into the united states in a difficult and dangerous way. %$* 213
suppose instead they took that thousands of dollars and paid it to an american employer to hire them for one week or two weeks or three weeks. %$* 213
they could come here legally. %$* 213
they would work for one week or two weeks or three weeks. %$* 213
they would then be laid off. %$* 213
and they would melt into the larger society. %$* 213
in other words, basically, you'd have to set up a police state to then catch them and deport them afterwards. %$* 213
that is really-- %$* 213
oh, come on. %$* 18
that is really scheming. %$* 213
i mean-- %$* 213
that's really complicated. %$* 213
with all these doomsday scenarios, to close off the borders? %$* 211
come on. %$* 211
that's an extreme situation again. %$* 211
i have to say-- %$* 13
this is the same as the tea party-- %$* 211
i have to say this concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
we're-- %$* 13
our motion is let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and now we're going to go on to round 3.round 3 are closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be three minutes each. %$* 13
immediately after their closing statements, we will have you vote a second time. %$* 13
and i want to remind you, you've already voted your position on this motion. %$* 13
and after hearing the arguments, you vote a second time. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers change the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, our motion is this: let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 13
and here to summarize his position against this motion, ron unz. %$* 13
he's former publisher of the american conservative magazine. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, ron unz. %$* 13
over the last 20, or 30, or 40 years, there's been a tremendous bifurcation of american society. %$* 213
the wealthier have gotten much wealthier. %$* 213
the rest of the people have not. %$* 213
we've reached the point right now where the top 1 percent of american society-- %$* 213
which has sometimes been in the headlines-- %$* 213
the top 1 percent has as much wealth as the bottom 95 percent. %$* 213
in the last few years, since the 2008 financial crisis, virtually all of the gains in wealth in income have gone to that wealthy elite and virtually none of it to the rest of the population. %$* 213
now, that's a bad situation. %$* 213
to make a bad situation like that much worse would be to cause the vast majority of ordinary american workers to suddenly have to compete for their jobs against everybody in the rest of the world. %$* 213
it would destroy their incomes. %$* 213
what we're talking about, again, is something that certainly would benefit the best educated, the wealthy elite, the affluent people in society, to be honest. %$* 213
the proposal that we're talking about probably would benefit many-- %$* 213
perhaps even the majority, perhaps even the vast majority of the people sitting here in this audience. %$* 213
i mean, we're talking about new york city, one of the wealthiest cities in the united states. %$* 213
we're talking about the sort of people who attend a debate like this. %$* 213
many of you might not be wealthy right now, but you're young in your careers. %$* 213
you certainly have a lot of prospects. %$* 213
probably many of you would benefit from something that would drive down the wages and income of 60, 70, 80 percent of the rest of the people in society, but it would make the political situation much worse than it is right now. %$* 213
what we have to do is make changes and other proposals and other aspects of our society to alleviate the problems we've had over the last 20 or 30 years, in terms of this wealth gap. %$* 213
not make them much worse. %$* 213
the proposal we're talking about would be devastating to the vast majority of americans and should be voted against. %$* 213
thank you, ron unz. %$* 13
our motion is, "let anyone take a job anywhere." and here to summarize his position supporting this motion, vivek wadhwa, vice president of research and innovation at singularity university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
right through american history, we've had these same debates, that foreigners will take american jobs away. %$* 211
we always blamed foreigners for all the ills. %$* 211
and now my friend over there is blaming foreigners for the income disparity between the rich and the poor. %$* 211
immigrants haven't done that. %$* 211
that's the evil wall street that's done that, my friend. %$* 211
that's a different problem in american society. %$* 211
we can have a balanced immigration policy, which allows people in that makes sense for america, that make it more competitive to come in here. %$* 211
it's happened with skilled immigration. %$* 211
skilled immigration has made america the most fiercely competitive land in the world. %$* 211
we're seeing benefits from it. %$* 211
it's uplifting society. %$* 211
a lot of good has come from skilled immigration. %$* 211
we're moving into this knowledge economy in which we really tested what happens with open borders. %$* 211
the fact that we're communicating, connecting with people everywhere. %$* 211
our children are now connected to children in the poorest parts of the world because of open borders, which is the internet. %$* 211
so closing off borders, saying that, no, you can't have people taking a job, you know, where they need to, is like closing off the internet. %$* 211
it doesn't make sense in this-- %$* 211
in this modern day era. %$* 211
it's good for america. %$* 211
it's made what is-- %$* 211
america what it is. %$* 211
let's get beyond this protectionism. %$* 211
let's get beyond this close mindedness and blaming foreigners. %$* 211
there's billions of mexicans that are going to come in and take our jobs away. %$* 211
they're going to decimate our standard of living. %$* 211
false. %$* 211
they have made this country fiercely competitive, made this country great. %$* 211
let's do more of it, not less of it. %$* 211
we can control wages. %$* 211
we can have minimum wages so that we don't have them going down to zero, we don't have fierce competition for low-skilled jobs. %$* 211
american employers are not able. %$* 211
american employers are doing what's best for their employees and for themselves and for their investors. %$* 211
we can trust them to hire people that make sense for them. %$* 211
let's not try to overregulate the employer. %$* 211
let's open up so that we bring in the people that we need in this great country. %$* 211
thank you, vivek wadhwa. %$* 13
our motion is, "let anyone take a job anywhere." and here to close her position against this motion, kathleen newland, cofounder of the migration policy institute. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kathleen newland. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 212
i think in order to decide how to vote on this proposition of "let anyone take a job anywhere," we need to think about what the alternatives are. %$* 212
and the alternative, i think, is a better managed, a more thoughtful labor market policy, a more thoughtful immigration policy. %$* 212
as i said before, currently only 14 percent of our immigration intake, the number of permanent residency permits that are granted every year are granted to immigrants who are sponsored by an employer. %$* 212
so increase that. %$* 212
so increase our intake of skilled people, but not to the exclusion of poor-- %$* 212
many of the family members who come into our dominant family stream are not wealthy people. %$* 212
their children do well. %$* 212
they become the bedrock of this society. %$* 212
and i couldn't agree more with vivek's statement that immigration has been a tremendous benefit to america. %$* 212
but what we need is a thoughtful, measured, targeted immigration and labor market policy. %$* 212
and i think that that needs to be a public policy framework that is set through public debate, like this one, and where people other than only employers have a say in who comes in to be our neighbors and who and how many people constitute and reconstitute and renew american society. %$* 212
thank you, kathleen newland. %$* 13
our motion, "let anyone take a job anywhere," and here to summarize his possession supporting this motion, bryan caplan, professor of economics at george mason university. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, bryan caplan. %$* 13
as vivek said, it is hard to believe that we're actually even debating "let anyone take a job anywhere." if our opponents had told you that the laws prevent women from working, or the laws prevent jews from working, or the laws prevent blacks from working, you wouldn't just disagree. %$* 210
you would be appalled. %$* 210
you would be horrified to hear such words coming out of their mouth. %$* 210
you should be equally appalled when someone says the laws prevent foreigners from working. %$* 210
criminalizing the employment of women, jews, blacks or foreigners is doubly evil. %$* 210
it denies workers' basic human rights. %$* 210
and it deprives the world of the full benefit of workers' talent and ambition. %$* 210
open borders should be a bipartisan and bi-ideological cause. %$* 210
conservatives should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of freedom, free markets, small government, the work ethic, meritocracy and to horatio alger himself. %$* 210
liberals should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of equality. %$* 210
reducing poverty, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, social justice and the global 99 percent. %$* 210
when the government forbids american farmers to hire mexican farmworkers, how can a conservative not see the oppressive hand of big government crushing the entrepreneurial spirit? %$* 210
when the government forbids american restaurants to hire haitian dishwashers, how can a liberal not see a heartless legal system, diabolically promoting poverty and discrimination? %$* 210
please, let anyone take a job anywhere. %$* 210
it is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. %$* 210
it will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing. %$* 210
thank you, bryan caplan. %$* 13
and that concludes closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to see which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
i want you to go again to the key pads at your seat and vote now the second time. %$* 13
remember it's the difference between the two votes that determines our winner. %$* 13
and the way the vote works, if you look at this motion: let anyone take a job anywhere, and if, after hearing the arguments, you agree with it, you're agreeing with this team, push number one. %$* 13
if you do not agree with this motion, you agree with this team, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
if you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. %$* 13
the system will register your last vote before we lock it out. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
it looks like everybody's done. %$* 13
we're about 90 seconds away from having the results. %$* 13
the first thing i want to do is say that it's our goal at intelligence squared to raise the level of public discourse by bringing real argumentation and respect and robust ideas and logic and wit. %$* 13
and we had that tonight. %$* 13
these debating-- %$* 13
these two teams were just terrific. %$* 13
and vivek, when you say that we shouldn't even be debating this that chills me to the bone. %$* 13
but i'm sure it was just rhetorical. %$* 13
no. %$* 211
i don't want to take your job away, my friend. %$* 211
all right. %$* 13
and everybody who got up and asked a question tonight, they all got through. %$* 13
and thank you for working with me on reshaping the questions. %$* 13
i appreciate that you have the nerve to get up and do that in front of everybody. %$* 13
so thank you to everybody who asked a question. %$* 13
we would love it if you tweeted about this debate. %$* 13
twitter handle again is @iq2us.the hash tag for this debate is jobs debate. %$* 13
our next debate is in two weeks, a little over two weeks, thursday, november 19th. %$* 13
the motion we'll be debating that night "the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness." and i'm sorry, that's on november-- %$* 13
did i say 14th? %$* 13
did i say the 14th? %$* 13
yes. %$* 18
and arguing for the motion that the constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness, alan dershowitz. %$* 13
he's the harvard law professor who's been called one of the nation‚Äôs most distinguished defenders of individual rights, and not just by alan dershowitz. %$* 13
his partner-- %$* 13
his partner is sanford levinson. %$* 13
he's a political scientist and a law professor and author of the book, "our undemocratic constitution." against the motion, david kopel, he's research director at the independence institute and one of the foremost second american scholars; and eugene volokh, who is a professor at ucla's school of law and founder of the volokh conspiracy, one of the most widely read legal blogs in the nation. %$* 13
on wednesday, november 20th, we're going to be in washington, d.c.in partnership with the mccain institute debating this motion: spy on me, i'd rather be safe. %$* 13
tickets for all of our remaining debates are available through our website, www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and for those who can't join, of course, we've been streaming on fora.tv and on iq2us.org. %$* 13
and this debate will be on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
just check your local listings, and you can hear your own applause going out to the nation. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
we have the results in. %$* 13
remember, you have voted twice, before the debate and once again after the debate. %$* 13
the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
in the opening vote, 46 percent of you agreed with the motion, "let anyone take a job anywhere." 21 percent were against the motion. %$* 13
33 percent were divided. %$* 13
the second vote "let anyone take a job anywhere," the team arguing for the motion, they went from 46 percent to 42 percent. %$* 13
that's a loss of four percentage points. %$* 13
the team arguing against the other side, i think we can see where this is going, their second vote was 49 percent. %$* 13
that's an increase of 28 percentage points. %$* 13
they are our winners, the team arguing against the motion, "let anyone take a job anywhere," are our winners. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

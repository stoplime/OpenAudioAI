of the sort for living vendors, and they're not donors, they are vendors if we’re paying them to donate. %$* 513
why not do an experiment, because so much of what we have said today, on both sides, is actually a matter of speculation. %$* 513
we don’t know whether it would be, some of these proposals would be effective or not. %$* 513
we don’t know whether they’ll have bad consequences. %$* 513
i think the main reason we should not change the federal and several state laws in order to allow some of the kinds of experiments that have been proposed would be precisely that we would then cross the barrier that i think david has emphasized, that once you’ve made the organs into a commodity, you won't be able to turn back, and that— %$* 513
okay. %$* 510
the experiments, i think would be dangerous to do— %$* 513
well, we got half %$* 510
i have to make one, this is directly contrary to what the iom report of two years ago, of which, weren't you— %$* 515
that’s the institute of medicine? %$* 510
institute of medicine report, which said no experiments, no trials, nothing in— %$* 515
the experiments— %$* 514
well, you pay extra for the furniture, so just, just %$* 510
all right, let’s go get another question here from the audience. %$* 510
my question is directly a follow up on the preceding question, and it’s directed at dr. %$* 10
friedman. %$* 10
clearly if forty thousand people die every year waiting for these, waiting unsuccessfully for kidneys, and seventy-five thousand suffer on dialysis and lose their strength waiting for kidneys, then the current system is not working despite what james childress says. %$* 10
it’s not working well enough. %$* 10
now you pointed out before that there may be some long term consequences to donors, but the number that always appears in literature is that only point oh three percent of donors die as a result, in the long term or even in the short term, of donating a kidney. %$* 10
so, it sounds like a very safe thing to do. %$* 10
why aren't the major advocacy organizations doing more pilot research to assess whether there are any long terms risks, and also doing research on what types of compensation systems would mitigate some of the objections raised by the other side? %$* 10
i'm amazed that the advocacy organizations have adopted such a do nothing position. %$* 10
and finally, let me just ask dr. %$* 10
delmonico, you’ve mentioned several times, and the other members of your panel, that the people on the other side are guilty of market fundamentalism, and i wondered whether perhaps on this side there was an overdose of equality fundamentalism, so that people in this country may be dying waiting because of concerns that in other parts of the world poor people are selling their organs. %$* 10
okay, let’s, we’ll get, amy, do you want to handle that? %$* 510
yeah, thank you for your comments on lag donor safety. %$* 511
it’s critically important. %$* 511
nobody has done these long term studies because we don’t have a mechanism to capture and retain information about the donors twenty and thirty years out, and we don’t have the means of paying for it. %$* 511
right now we can have a donor who has no medical insurance whatsoever come and donate a kidney because the recipients insurance pays for it, but we have no mechanism after they get through the early post- operative period to pay for their care. %$* 511
that’s expensive. %$* 511
and that's a part of what would need to be in a regulated system. %$* 511
and thank you very much, all of the advocacy organizations, the american society of transplant surgeons, the american society of transplantation, the government, and everybody at this table, on both sides, very much agrees that we need to capture the information about donors, we just can't afford to, and in the absence of universal health care or a single system, we can't do it because they just escape, we can't track them. %$* 511
frank, did you want to respond? %$* 510
yes, i do. %$* 514
four thousand people dying on the list, forty percent of the people who are dying are not in need of kidneys. %$* 514
they would not, the market system would not affect them by having more organs available, because you can't buy a heart, you can't, unless you're in egypt you can't buy a liver, you can't buy a lung. %$* 514
one of the problems of the proposal is that, and david brought this up, the assumption that those patients would still have a cadre of deceased organs available. %$* 514
but that experiment has been done in hong kong and in other places. %$* 514
when you have markets, there is no, the deceased donation is negatively impacted. %$* 514
so, right away, when you say four thousand people are dying on the list, not quite, but almost half are dying in need of organs that he market system will not impact. %$* 514
now, next, on the kidney front, of those that are dying, we need to make an assessment of why they're dying, and whether or not that is simply because they have not received an organ. %$* 514
some of the patients that are dying on the list have been on that list for an extended period of time, inactive. %$* 514
and this was a point that we didn't get an opportunity to discuss. %$* 514
inactive means that you do not receive an offer for a kidney. %$* 514
the market system will not impact an individual that is inactive on the list. %$* 514
currently, thirty-three percent of the list, waiting for kidneys, twenty-four thousand patients are inactive on the list. %$* 514
that needs to be evaluated further before we go down the road of a market, we better assess the wait list of the premise to have markets. %$* 514
okay, we’ve run out of time for this section of the audience participation, now we’re going to move to the final last lap here, the closing remarks. %$* 510
each one of the debaters will get two minutes to sum up or rebut whatever they’d like to say, and i’ll give you a one minute warning, and we’ll start with jim, you go first. %$* 510
thanks. %$* 513
i have never said that our current system. %$* 513
you can go up there if you’d like to. %$* 510
oh, that's fine, i’ll sit here, i’ll be fine. %$* 513
i’ve never said that our current system is working well enough. %$* 513
i think we have a good system, not yet a great system, and i think we need to do a lot more to improve it, and i think we can do so. %$* 513
and i would just note in response to amy’s comment, that we simply can't afford to develop a mechanism to follow up on living donors. %$* 513
if we can't afford to do that, then we cannot afford to do what we need to do to make a market in living vendors and sellers for kidneys work. %$* 513
we cannot, i would argue, destroy, we should not, i would argue, damage or destroy our system, which is not working as well as it should, and we need to improve, by adopting a flawed market in organs. %$* 513
our opponents have proposed a radical change in our organ transplant system, and yet they’ve failed, in my judgement, to satisfy the burden of proof required for a drastic alteration of a system that is working fairly well and that can be further improved. %$* 513
by contrast, we’ve, i think, given good reasons for suspicion of such a market, and i hope that you will vote no for legalizing, that is, against legalizing a market in organs. %$* 513
thanks. %$* 513
i have never said that our current system. %$* 513
all right, you have a minute left. %$* 510
i'm done. %$* 513
okay, thank you for— %$* 510
can i take his minute? %$* 512
you're, well, i'm going to go to sally next. %$* 510
can he yield his time to— %$* 512
sally, you have two minutes. %$* 510
okay. %$* 512
sally satel. %$* 510
thanks. %$* 512
well, during the time we’ve been here tonight, yes, someone has died, and this was a real person with a real family who would have lived if there were enough organs. %$* 512
it may sound maudlin, but it’s very true. %$* 512
and this is why we need to compensate donors. %$* 512
altruism, or whatever is in that area between being paid and giving an organ is not enough. %$* 512
and insisting that it remain the basis for transplant policy is a reckless and derelict stance that will only guarantee a future of suffering, and not just for the patients, but for, who will languish and die on dialysis, but for black market donors as well. %$* 512
our opponents hate the black market, well so do we. %$* 512
but somehow we learned something they never did, that the only way to stop elicit transactions is to sanction legal ones. %$* 512
simply clamping down on elicit sales only drives it further underground, or causes it to blossom somewhere else, and the only way out of this tragic bind is to increase the supply. %$* 512
and the only way to do that is through a fair, transparent, safe, and legal means of exchange. %$* 512
until then, the fate of third world donors and the patients who need their organs to live will remain tragically entwined. %$* 512
and until then, our opponents, who refuse to allow even experimentation with compensation, will be complicit, yes complicit, in fostering the organ trade. %$* 512
we welcome the other side to work with us, but as you’ve seen, they’ve never met a proposal they didn't reject or attack, they have a dearth of creative ideas, but an abundance of passion for obstructing innovation. %$* 512
in closing, unless we establish a legal market for kidneys in some form, we should brace ourselves for more needless suffering and death. %$* 512
our side refuses to stand for that. %$* 512
so should you. %$* 512
it’s too high a price for a humane society to bear. %$* 512
thank you. %$* 512
okay. %$* 512
can he yield his time to— %$* 512
can i take his minute? %$* 512
now speaking against, francis delmonico. %$* 510
when sally says someone has died in just, you know, in the past moments, what you have to understand is that someone has died, and a market system wouldn't have impacted that death. %$* 514
if you're dying in need of a heart, you can't buy a heart. %$* 514
so, someone has died, and we do need more deceased organs, there’s no question about that, but the premise of a market system, by death on the list, is not resolved by a market system. %$* 514
next, a dearth of creative ideas? %$* 514
sally and i have met on a number of occasions to talk about what we can do differently to provide care for live donors that does not exist in this country, but is not a cash payment. %$* 514
sally and amy are contradictory. %$* 514
when amy says you can't go out of the country, and sally says, well, you can go right now out of the country. %$* 514
i could have gone. %$* 512
exactly. %$* 514
she could have gone, and they do go. %$* 514
and it’s not just that they're going from the united states, but they're going from canada, and saudi arabia, and israel, and the gulf countries, and from europe. %$* 514
and where are they going? %$* 514
and why wouldn't they go? %$* 514
and the question that was posed to amy, the seventy- two year old patient that she has, and ira, excuse me, ira comes along and he, in the system that they—ira’s going to be the donor. %$* 514
wonderful. %$* 514
but why should that seventy-two year old or a fifty year old accept ira when they can go to manila, if it’s legalized? %$* 514
right? %$* 514
sorry, ira. %$* 514
when sally says someone has died in just, you know, in the past moments, what you have to understand is that someone has died, and a market system wouldn't have impacted that death. %$* 514
if you're dying in need of a heart, you can't buy a heart. %$* 514
so, someone has died, and we do need more deceased organs, there’s no question about that, but the premise of a market system, by death on the list, is not resolved by a market system. %$* 514
next, a dearth of creative ideas? %$* 514
sally and i have met on a number of occasions to talk about what we can do differently to provide care for live donors that does not exist in this country, but is not a cash payment. %$* 514
sally and amy are contradictory. %$* 514
when amy says you can't go out of the country, and sally says, well, you can go right now out of the country. %$* 514
it’s okay. %$* 510
why should they accept— %$* 514
it’s an old kidney, so— %$* 510
why should they accept ira when they can go for a twenty year old and purchase that, because the united states says it’s okay to buy your kidneys. %$* 514
let’s have an outlet store in the poor countries of the world to go and buy kidneys. %$* 514
that’s the problem that’s created by the united states saying it’s okay to have a market. %$* 514
thank you. %$* 510
moving on to the for side, amy friedman. %$* 510
our opponents have told you that payment has been tried and is unsafe. %$* 511
been there, done that. %$* 511
we tell you we know the way it’s being done now is wrong, let’s regulate it and do it right. %$* 511
we have no intention of stopping efforts to increase the number of deceased donor organs. %$* 511
this does not, in any way, affect those efforts. %$* 511
we can't afford independently, as transplant centers, or independent societies of transplant surgeons for example, to follow these live donors. %$* 511
we don’t have those funds. %$* 511
the government could provide the funds to long term provide the safety net and understand what’s happening with live donors. %$* 511
what we propose is the only solution to closing the dangerous black market. %$* 511
they’ve implied the dignity of the donor would be assaulted. %$* 511
we’ve told you there’s no dignity for people dying. %$* 511
we propose an approach that preserves the rights of donors, and compensates them for the risks they do assume. %$* 511
one minute. %$* 510
we’ll allow them to join us, the club of people who benefit from their life-saving gift. %$* 511
isn't that treating them in a most dignified manner? %$* 511
this is supposedly an academic debate, and david even called it an exercise, but the ninety-nine thousand people currently waiting for organs, who are there for so long that they become inactive because they're too sick to get the transplant then, need real solutions, and they need you and us to be willing to think out of the box. %$* 511
there are lots of clever people available in this country to devise a system that can do it right, let’s do so. %$* 511
our opponents have told you that payment has been tried and is unsafe. %$* 511
been there, done that. %$* 511
we tell you we know the way it’s being done now is wrong, let’s regulate it and do it right. %$* 511
we have no intention of stopping efforts to increase the number of deceased donor organs. %$* 511
this does not, in any way, affect those efforts. %$* 511
we can't afford independently, as transplant centers, or independent societies of transplant surgeons for example, to follow these live donors. %$* 511
we don’t have those funds. %$* 511
the government could provide the funds to long term provide the safety net and understand what’s happening with live donors. %$* 511
what we propose is the only solution to closing the dangerous black market. %$* 511
they’ve implied the dignity of the donor would be assaulted. %$* 511
we’ve told you there’s no dignity for people dying. %$* 511
we propose an approach that preserves the rights of donors, and compensates them for the risks they do assume. %$* 511
thank you, on the against side, david rothman. %$* 510
your two minutes. %$* 510
well, some quick principles. %$* 516
first, beware of doctors who play regulators and economists. %$* 516
what you’ve heard from the physicians is fantasy. %$* 516
i'm not sure lawyers are much better at it, having heard lloyd, but you're in a never-never land, truly in a never-never land. %$* 516
we’re going to not have immigrants do it. %$* 516
why not have immigrants do it? %$* 516
helter-skelter. %$* 516
sally came out with a formulation which those of us in new york are a little scared about. %$* 516
the only way to stamp out illicit behavior is to legalize it. %$* 516
i can think of commercial sex work, but i don’t want to go there. %$* 516
second, don’t think that you're doing the poor a favor. %$* 516
you want to do the poor a favor, start thinking in terms of economic development, watch what china did, watch what india is in the process of doing. %$* 516
massive infusions of capital, growth, real change. %$* 516
this kind of pittance of giving the poor a little money— %$* 516
one minute. %$* 510
here so that they can, you know, sell their body part, that’s absurd. %$* 516
you want to do something for the poor, do it in a real way, spur economic development. %$* 516
finally, you're not doing the middle class any favor here either. %$* 516
i made that point with college, there’s got to be a better way to pay for an expensive wedding. %$* 516
don’t go down that route. %$* 516
speaking for, final words, lloyd cohen. %$* 510
so much pernicious, pretentious foolishness to refute, so little time. %$* 515
are you shocked and surprised that anyone would argue that paying for organs will not increase the supply? %$* 515
i was at first, and then it became clear. %$* 515
the prospect of an effective organ market places our opponents behind the eight ball. %$* 515
a market that would recover vital organs now being fed to worms would be the salvation of thousands of patients. %$* 515
as against the saving of innocent lives, poetic statements about the dignity of human life being degraded by commercialism would be revealed as empty moral pieties. %$* 515
our opponents would therefore prefer to believe that a market would not work, and demand that we must prove that it will. %$* 515
the obvious way to demonstrate the efficacy of a market is to permit one, but of course the law forbids that. %$* 515
so what other evidence or theory can i offer? %$* 515
first, consider the thriving organ markets in living donors in places like india. %$* 515
a market in the us where the interest of donors would be safeguarded by american law would, of course, be much more successful. %$* 515
and there’s no reason to think that somehow the american market would be like the indian market, in the same way there’s no reason to think, if any of you have been to india, that potable water from the tap was as common in india as it is in the united states. %$* 515
one minute. %$* 510
and %$* 515
no! %$* 515
and what does the success of living donor markets say about a market in cadaver organs? %$* 515
the sacrifice is incomparably greater for the living donor than for the deceased, so the supply of deceased donors will be far more responsive to a positive price. %$* 515
second, look to the very reason that our opponents have such faith in the efficacy of altruism, and at the same time restrict its required application to organs rather than extend it to surgical services, nursing, and hospital care. %$* 515
they believe that altruism should work for transplant organs, because they are of no value to the dead, and of enormous value to the ill. %$* 515
whatever this vast disparity should say about the power of altruism, it speaks volumes in the world of markets. %$* 515
everywhere we look markets move goods from low valued uses to high valued ones. %$* 515
third— %$* 515
so much pernicious, pretentious foolishness to refute, so little time. %$* 515
are you shocked and surprised that anyone would argue that paying for organs will not increase the supply? %$* 515
i was at first, and then it became clear. %$* 515
the prospect of an effective organ market places our opponents behind the eight ball. %$* 515
a market that would recover vital organs now being fed to worms would be the salvation of thousands of patients. %$* 515
as against the saving of innocent lives, poetic statements about the dignity of human life being degraded by commercialism would be revealed as empty moral pieties. %$* 515
our opponents would therefore prefer to believe that a market would not work, and demand that we must prove that it will. %$* 515
the obvious way to demonstrate the efficacy of a market is to permit one, but of course the law forbids that. %$* 515
so what other evidence or theory can i offer? %$* 515
first, consider the thriving organ markets in living donors in places like india. %$* 515
a market in the us where the interest of donors would be safeguarded by american law would, of course, be much more successful. %$* 515
and there’s no reason to think that somehow the american market would be like the indian market, in the same way there’s no reason to think, if any of you have been to india, that potable water from the tap was as common in india as it is in the united states. %$* 515
lloyd, i got— %$* 510
ah! %$* 515
i’ve got seventeen more reasons, but you’ll have to talk to me privately. %$* 515
there you go. %$* 510
thank you all. %$* 510
time to pull out your little magic clicker and decide, we talk, you decide, so to speak, who’s going to carry the day pick up your key pad, i’ll tell you how to, once again you can see the motion is, “we should legalize the market for human organs.” if you are for the motion, press one. %$* 510
if you are against the motion, press two. %$* 510
and if you're still undecided, press three. %$* 510
so, cast your votes, and we’ll give you a little bit of time to do that. %$* 510
and while you're doing that i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our debaters up front here. %$* 510
lloyd cohen, professor of law at george mason university. %$* 510
amy friedman, director of transplantation, professor of surgery at suny upstate medical university. %$* 510
sally satel is a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institution for public policy research. %$* 510
on my left is james childress, professor of ethics at the university of virginia, and director of the institute for practical ethics in public life. %$* 510
francis delmonico, professor of surgery at harvard medical school, and director of medical affairs for the transplantation society. %$* 510
and finally, david rothman, professor of social medicine, and director of the center on medicine as a profession at columbia. %$* 510
this is the last debate of the second intelligence squared us series. %$* 510
this program has been a huge success because of the support of people like you out there in the audience, audience members like yourselves who have been very enthusiastic about hearing both sides of big issues, and great issues they are, arguments that are brought here in all the series debates that have been hosted. %$* 510
intelligence squared would also like to thank the asia society and museum for being our venue, right here in this beautiful auditorium, thank you from the very beginning. %$* 510
and as many of you already knew, due to the overwhelming success, and the demand for tickets, they're going to be moving out of this auditorium and into a bigger place. %$* 510
intelligence squared is going to resume in the fall at the larger caspary auditorium at rockefeller university. %$* 510
you know that big building that looks like the geodesic dome there at the caspary auditorium? %$* 510
that’s at 66th and york. %$* 510
and that first debate is going to be on tuesday, september 16th. %$* 510
oh, this is a good one, small little topic, the motion: “government mandated universal health care means inferior health care.” that’s the motion that you can come and vote on, and a ticket package and individual tickets for the fall in 2008 and spring 2009 series will go on sale later this month. %$* 510
an email alert and a brochure is going to be coming out in the coming weeks, so you're not going to be able to avoid that. %$* 510
you can check the website also for updates. %$* 510
you can also get an edited version of tonight’s intelligence squared debate, it can be heard locally on wnyc, am820, coming up on sunday, that's may 25th, at 8pm. %$* 510
these debates are also heard on more than a hundred and fifty npr member stations, and of course, as they say, please check your local member station listings for the dates and times outside of new york city. %$* 510
also, you can, of course, purchase a dvd from previous debates upstairs from the intelligence squared us website. %$* 510
and now here is the result of the final polling. %$* 510
before the debate we had forty- four percent for the resolution, after the debate we have sixty percent. %$* 510
thank you, thank you. %$* 512
thank you. %$* 515
against, against the debate, before we had twenty-seven percent, and it moved up just four points to thirty-one percent against. %$* 510
but it was the, of course, the undecideds who decided this, from twenty-nine percent to nine percent, a twenty point move. %$* 510
so we had sixty percent for, thirty-one percent against, nine percent undecided. %$* 510
thank you all for coming tonight, we’ll see you on friday, on science friday. %$* 510
congratulations— %$* 510

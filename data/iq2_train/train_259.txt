he might be a great president, by the way. %$* 674
i have no reason to think that he wouldn't be. %$* 674
and i might vote for him. %$* 674
but the fact that a guy with $16 billion can't become president of the united states simply by buying the election does not strike me as a flaw in a democratic-- %$* 674
raise $500 million? %$* 18
yeah. %$* 18
no, i think essentially we will-- %$* 673
the problems that our opponents raise are valid problems, and these-- %$* 673
but this is a democracy. %$* 673
and these problems will be answered when we, the demos demand that they be answered. %$* 673
there is no magic trick that we can impose to fix this. %$* 673
sir, you are the most aggressive hand-raiser of this evening. %$* 13
so this had better be good. %$* 13
passion, passion. %$* 18
mr. %$* 18
o'rourke, you just mentioned actually that you're getting more responses of how to change things from the audience. %$* 18
i think that was what arianna was discussing about multiple voices. %$* 18
so that's-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 673
fair enough. %$* 673
fair enough. %$* 673
that's fair and balanced of you. %$* 673
indeed. %$* 18
indeed. %$* 18
my question is actually, our founding fathers wanted church and state separated. %$* 18
if i'm not mistaken, i don't believe it was until the '50s, until "in god we trust" started getting printed on money. %$* 18
how do you think religion is affecting the two-party system? %$* 18
ooh. %$* 673
ooh, you know? %$* 673
they want them separated. %$* 673
they didn't want them extinguished, either of the two things in question. %$* 673
i actually think that religion is a little bit on the decline in terms of its influence. %$* 673
i think it probably reached its peak influence in the united states with the prohibition, which was not entirely church driven, but there was certainly a very, very strong. %$* 673
but william jennings brian and the populist party, one of the third parties that some people may be in favor of, was a strongly religious party. %$* 673
he's the guy that ended up prosecuting the monkey trial on the teachings of charles darwin. %$* 673
the strongest religious influence was then. %$* 673
there was then a resurgence, of course, during the social values debate of the '80s. %$* 673
i would say at the moment, it's a bit on the decline partly because fundamentalist protestants have realized that in many ways they have a lot of things in common with at least centrist democrats in terms of social policy. %$* 673
certain things they don't have in common, of course, questions of abortion and so on. %$* 673
but they-- %$* 673
but does this relate to the two-partiness of our system, necessarily? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 673
there's no doubt that religious questions have a greater influence on the republican party than they do on the democratic party, leaving reverend wright aside. %$* 673
but really, i think it's a little bit of an issue in decline in the united states-- %$* 673
all right. %$* 13
personally. %$* 673
there is a green striped shirt. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, please. %$* 13
you are all the most qualified people to respond to this. %$* 19
in point of fact, it's not a two- party system because there are other parties on the voting ballots. %$* 19
but is the problem the media which makes people think it's only a two-party system? %$* 19
can i ask you-- %$* 13
it's a little bit of a rephrasing of the question we had earlier about the media sort of perpetuating this sense that there are only two parties. %$* 13
do you have that sense? %$* 13
and do you think that's a problem? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
it seems like there's very little coverage of third-party candidates unless they're eccentric in some respect. %$* 19
and they are. %$* 18
and they're always presented as by-- %$* 19
they're represented by their eccentricities instead of by their-- %$* 19
and what's lost in that? %$* 13
position. %$* 19
and what's lost as a result of that? %$* 13
i don't know. %$* 19
well, what i'm asking is do you agree with this side that there are voices that are not being heard because of this-- %$* 13
is that a problem for you? %$* 13
absolutely, in the fact that the ballots always have democrat and republican first. %$* 19
i think they should be in alphabetical order because the republicans would change the name of their party in a second and the fact that people run under different parties, but most americans are not educated-- %$* 19
sorry-- %$* 19
don't approach the poll i think in a very thoughtful way and realize that they could vote for the same person but under a different party. %$* 19
strengthen third parties. %$* 19
more money will go to third parties. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
money follows votes. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
but i've got to stop you. %$* 13
but why don't you take on the question, because it is slightly different. %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
well, you know, i do this for a living. %$* 344
and i sometimes go on tv shows, and the tv shows i happen to go on are some of the best on tv, the news hour with jim lehrer, which is much less partisan shouting than most. %$* 344
and yet the shows all of us are on, you are either the republican seat or the democratic seat. %$* 344
and i consider myself hamiltonian, like i've been saying, which fits very awkwardly with the current republican party. %$* 344
and yet that's my seat. %$* 344
that's my role. %$* 344
that's what i play on tv.and so it's sometimes frustrating. %$* 344
i can imagine for people further outside one of those parties, it's frustrating because you're put into that slot. %$* 344
and i've been very struck by-- %$* 344
i think when i started doing this, people would say, “are you conservative or liberal? %$* 344
” now people come up to me, “are you a republican or democrat? %$* 344
” the label republican or democrat has sup planted conservative or liberal. %$* 344
it's not what you believe. %$* 344
it's what team you're on. %$* 344
and that's part of-- %$* 344
feel that. %$* 673
i happen to be a republican, but i am primarily a libertarian conservative and when i go on shows, not quite the same quality of shows as david goes on-- %$* 673
my place-- %$* 673
i'm on bill maher-- %$* 673
my place is there as a sort of a kooky libertarian conservative, a guy who's really, really conservative, really, really republican, but thinks about marijuana, it’s a drug that makes teenage boys drive slow and what’s wrong with that? %$* 673
and so i think that there are broader categories than merely democratic and republican. %$* 673
okay, and gentleman in the center, if you could stand-- %$* 13
yep, that's you, thank you. %$* 13
you know, it would seem obviously that the audience by the fact that we’re all here today is very interested in the debate and what the panel has to say. %$* 18
but it would also seem that most americans are moderate and they don’t think in terms of left or right, but in what affects them. %$* 18
and it doesn’t seem that the two-party system that we have today does reflect what they want as the people. %$* 18
okay, so i’m taking that as a comment to this side. %$* 13
except in this one respect – %$* 673
let’s have zev take this one. %$* 13
let me agree with you first of all that most americans are not here tonight. %$* 674
we can prove that statistically. %$* 673
statistically, the world bank i do think that statements like the people don’t get what they want, that may be true, i mean you don’t always in life, right? %$* 674
but at least there are vehicles, that's all that a democracy can offer. %$* 674
it can offer ways to express yourself in the media, in new media, old media, on the street corner, in groups, however you want to do it, and politically within organized parties. %$* 674
are they the democrats and the republicans or are they as you suggest the republicans have changed their name to triple a so they'll be first on the ballot, you know, like-- %$* 674
i was thinking a-hole, myself. %$* 673
that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
those closing statements will be two minutes each, and remember you voted before the debate and you’re going to be asked to vote again right afterwards, and this is their last chance to change your minds. %$* 13
so on to round three, closing statements, our motion is "the two-party system is making american ungovernable." here to speak against the motion, p.j. o'rourke, political satirist, journalist, and author of 13 books including "don’t vote-- %$* 13
it just encourages the bastards." %$* 13
okay, our vague and sloppy political system keeps america away from abstract political theories. %$* 673
in all 20th century was an experiment in abstract political theory, vigorously applied in places like italy, germany, spain, russia, china, north korea, cuba, also in rhodesia, and apartheid south africa, and among some of my loonier friends who joined the weather underground, you know? %$* 673
away from abstract political theory is a good place to be. %$* 673
our compromised and compromising system with its messy conflicts and its fitful bipartisanship, keeps governance close to real life because in reality we all contain within ourselves elements of the democrat and the republican. %$* 673
we are conservatives when we catch the kids smoking pot and we're quite liberal when we catch ourselves doing it. %$* 673
no one ever says “oh, goody,” when it's time to pay taxes and no one ever turns down a government benefit. %$* 673
abandoning the two-party system would mean abandoning a great truth, the truth that we're all of two minds about politics, greater certainty in our political opinions would mean more politics, more arguments, more strife, we don't need that, we've got enough, giving up on the lame old political generalities of democrats and republicans would make politics more important in america. %$* 673
now, as a reporter i have spent a lot of time in places where politics are a life or death matter, let's not go there. %$* 673
indeed, my closing argument is a simple plea for personal mercy. %$* 673
i've been covering american politics for 40 years, two parties is as many as i can stand. %$* 673
well, thank you, p.j.o’rourke. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making american ungovernable,” and here to speak for the motion, arianna huffington, president and editor-in-chief of the huffington post media group. %$* 13
so, if all you care about here tonight is to make p.j.’s life easier, vote against this motion. %$* 672
if you care about making the life of the country better, vote with us. %$* 672
basically, the two- party system is like a stale marriage. %$* 672
democrats and republicans need something to spice it up. %$* 672
they need to go on craigslist and find a third party. %$* 672
and if that third party isn’t wearing a shirt, they really should do a background check. %$* 672
because he might turn out to be a member of congress, and you don’t want to go there. %$* 672
so, i remember in 2000 i organized a shadow convention. %$* 672
the shadow conventions were intended to address issues that the two political parties were not addressing. %$* 672
and those issues were the growing income inequalities, the failed war on drugs that has put more african americans in jail than that have jobs at the moment, and also the problem that was addressed here tonight of campaign financial reform and the desperate need to do that. %$* 672
since 2000, all these problems have gotten worse, and they have gotten worse because the two-party system has made this country ungovernable. %$* 672
and unless you give up on the idea of america becoming a more perfect union. %$* 672
unless you give up on the idea of us being able to really live up to the american dream of our ancestors, then you’ve got to vote with david and me. %$* 672
thank you, arianna huffington. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” here to summarize his position against the motion, zev chafets, a columnist, an author of 12 books and founding editor of the jerusalem report. %$* 13
ninety-nine years ago, a guy stood up at a political convention, a third-party convention, and he said, “we stand at armageddon, and we battle for the lord.” that was teddy roosevelt. %$* 674
“armageddon” was woodrow wilson. %$* 674
it’s always armageddon for people who have that tendency, and it’s good that there are people who think it’s armageddon because they push. %$* 674
that’s a good thing. %$* 674
i support that. %$* 674
i’m in favor of it. %$* 674
there’s a place for it in the political parties. %$* 674
but tonight we’re talking about a specific motion, which is that the two-party system is making american ungovernable. %$* 674
in order for you to vote for that, you have to agree to two things. %$* 674
you have to agree that america is becoming ungovernable, or perhaps it is already, as arianna said in the beginning, has become ungovernable. %$* 674
i don’t think that that’s the case. %$* 674
i don’t think that any of you who came here today by car, by bus, by train, by plane, however you got here, travelled through a space which anyone could regard as ungovernable. %$* 674
american is a highly governed country. %$* 674
it has flaws, it has problems, it has economic inequalities-- %$* 674
all of these things have existed, and they’ll continue to exist. %$* 674
they’re part of the human condition. %$* 674
america needs to be a more perfect society; it can’t be a perfect society because no society is perfect. %$* 674
the second proposition that you have to agree to, even if you think that the world and america as you know it is ungovernable-- %$* 674
ungovernable! %$* 674
you have to believe that the reason that it’s ungovernable, that the bp disaster took place and the virginia mining disaster took place, and all the other disasters took place because of the two-party system. %$* 674
and i don’t really think that you can make that case. %$* 674
and therefore, i implore you to vote for our side. %$* 674
thank you, zev chafets. %$* 13
our motion, “the two-party system is making america ungovernable,” and here to summarize his position in favor of this motion, david brooks, the new york times op/ed columnist, commentator on the newshour, and coming out in a matter of weeks with a new book called “the social animal.” %$* 13
many of you have been looking at our side, at our table, and thought “those two are so much alike.” arianna’s a glamorous woman with continental manners. %$* 344
i aspire to be the fittest fat person in america. %$* 344
arianna created a business in which people write for free, and she sold it for more than $300 million. %$* 344
i have three credit cards, one of which i can use at any time. %$* 344
throughout this entire debate, she’s been texting matt damon and fergie. %$* 344
i’ve seen “the bourne identity.” arianna and i agree on most things. %$* 344
in fact, i think i can safely say i agree with zev and p.j.a lot more than i agree with arianna. %$* 344
and yet if arianna and i sat in a room and talked about the big issues facing our country, i bet we could reach some plausible solutions. %$* 344
but if we were elected to the two parties as they currently exist, we would never get in the same room because those two parties have gotten much more rigid. %$* 344
so when i take a look at the issues that are before us, and those issues have been alighted i think during this debate: immigration, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement; debt, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement. %$* 344
wage stagnation and inequality, a long-growing issue about which the two parties can reach no agreements; campaign finance. %$* 344
i could go on. %$* 344
these are all concrete issues that are right here in front of us. %$* 344
if you see a way for our current two-party system-- %$* 344
if you see an avenue for them to reach agreement and solutions on these issues, even in perfect solutions, well, then vote for the guys in the red ties. %$* 344
but if you don't, vote for the glamorous side. %$* 344
thank you. %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
and that completes our closing statements. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
now it's time to find out which side you feel argued best. %$* 13
we want to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat to register your vote, reminding you you voted once before. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most minds after this vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
our motion is “the two-party system is making america ungovernable.” if you agree, push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and we're going to have the votes in just a minute. %$* 13
and i'm going to announce the winner of the debate immediately afterwards. %$* 13
we're going to put up on the screen how the numbers broke down according to party affiliations that you registered when you came in. %$* 13
i won't be announcing those, but you can look at them on the board afterwards, or you can visit us online. %$* 13
a few of the things i want to take care of. %$* 13
first of all, i have thoroughly enjoyed this debate, like perhaps none other this group has been absolutely terrific. %$* 13
i want to thank them for being smart as well as engaging and entertaining. %$* 13
i also want to draw attention to one of the unsung heroes of this series, donna wolfe who puts these things on all the time sitting in the front row. %$* 13
at a minimum, you could raise your hand. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
. and i also want to thank the american clean skies foundation who has underwritten this entire season of debates. %$* 13
and thank you to them. %$* 13
and what this season is about, through this spring, this winter and spring, the theme is, “america's house divided.” that's what tonight was a part of. %$* 13
under that umbrella, and our next debate on tuesday, the 8th of march, the topic is “clean energy can drive america's economic recovery.” arguing for that motion we'll have bill ritter, the former governor of colorado who adopted one of the nation's strictest renewable energy mandates and whose state has the fourth largest concentration of clean energy workers in the country. %$* 13
joining him will be dan reicher, the former director of climate change and energy initiatives at google, who served as assistant secretary of energy under bill clinton. %$* 13
he now leads a new interdisciplinary center at stanford to advance clean energy technology. %$* 13
and arguing against that motion will be robert bryce who is the author of “power hungry: the myths of green energy and the real fuels of the future” and a self- described, quote, “liberal who got mugged by the laws of thermodynamics.” and his partner will be steven hayward, the author of “mere environmentalism,” an examination of the philosophical presuppositions underlying the environmental movement.” i wish i had written this myself. %$* 13

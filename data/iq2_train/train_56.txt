i want to move on now to the substance of the arguments that were made. %$* 13
and i want to take to this side the very strong charge made by your opponent, carol burris-- %$* 13
i want to take it to the side arguing to embrace the common core. %$* 13
carol burris's statement that there is no evidence that these standards actually will result in achievement. %$* 13
what's the evidence-- %$* 13
well, i would say-- %$* 249
carmel martin. %$* 13
it's early to judge the implementation of the standards. %$* 249
but that's not the question. %$* 13
the question is, where is the evidence-- %$* 13
i understand that. %$* 249
supporting them? %$* 13
i would-- %$* 249
but i would say, although it's early, we do see some signs of success. %$* 249
and i would point to kentucky, which was one of the first states to adopt the common core. %$* 249
and in-- %$* 249
carmel, can i stop you? %$* 13
only because of time limits, that i think the sense of the question is that when they were put together, prior to their implementation, that there was no evidence that they were-- %$* 13
they were based on no evidence that they would work, as opposed to how they've done-- %$* 13
well-- %$* 249
since then. %$* 13
i think-- %$* 13
okay. %$* 249
that was your point? %$* 13
yes. %$* 19
yep. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
well, i mean, i think that's just factually inaccurate. %$* 249
i think that the folks who got together to draft the new standards relied very heavily on the existing research that they had about what children needed to be able to do and what set of knowledge they needed to have to be successful in college and in good jobs. %$* 249
they brought in the people from the post-secondary sector, something that hadn't been done in k-12 education historically, which really is pretty illogical that that hadn't been done before. %$* 249
they brought in people from the business community to talk about what skills they needed their employees to have. %$* 249
they brought in content experts. %$* 249
they showed the standards to the associations that represent teachers in mathematics and english language arts. %$* 249
and they took in their input. %$* 249
i think neither mike nor i would say that each and every standard is perfect. %$* 249
but i think if you look at the process that was used in the development of these standards and compare-- %$* 249
okay. %$* 13
it to the process that was used under the old standards by most states, that it was very rigorous, and they did look at evidence. %$* 249
and you can-- %$* 249
okay. %$* 13
disagree, but they did look at evidence. %$* 249
carol burris, have you been refuted on this point? %$* 13
no. %$* 251
i-- %$* 251
the truth of the matter is, one of the things that's very different about the common core that i spoke about, is unlike the old massachusetts standards, the standards in new york-- %$* 251
which really just identify what kids should know at grade levels-- %$* 251
the common core standards create-- %$* 251
or contain what's called instructional shifts in practice. %$* 251
six in ela and six in %$* 251
ela? %$* 13
english language arts. %$* 251
thank you. %$* 251
for example, the whole idea that it makes sense for young children to engage in close reading-- %$* 251
there is absolutely no evidence that that's the case. %$* 251
at the high school level, yes. %$* 251
but not at the elementary level. %$* 251
there was no real research that was based on yanking up lexile levels. %$* 251
we know from years of developmental reading research that kids do best when they read independently with leveled readers. %$* 251
but the common core says no. %$* 251
the common core says predominant reading should be on what is considered to be grade level, which has just been increased. %$* 251
and if the kids don't get it, well, the teachers should read it aloud. %$* 251
well, let me tell you something. %$* 251
you learned how to ride your bicycle by riding your bicycle. %$* 251
you didn't learn how to ride your bicycle by having your dad never taking his hands off the bar. %$* 251
mike-- %$* 13
let's let mike petrilli respond. %$* 13
yeah, and i'm so glad that you raised this, a couple times, this idea of close reading. %$* 250
and i spent the big part of the weekend talking to some reading experts getting ready for this question, and i think i have a better understanding. %$* 250
it's going to get a little weedy, but i'll get through it very fast. %$* 250
and it's this. %$* 250
we've had a system for years where we've said, "okay, if a child can only read at the first-grade level and they're in fifth grade, we're going to give them first-grade level books, right, with the hope that over time they would get better. %$* 250
the problem is there's five or six rigorous studies showing by and large those kids were never getting better at reading. %$* 250
and that they're-- %$* 250
what the studies showed is what you really need to do is find ways to get the kids to read more challenging texts at their grade level, which means at first-- %$* 250
and the teachers today helped explain this so, so much better than i could-- %$* 250
that the teachers start by reading it aloud, having the kids follow along. %$* 250
they do what they call, "scaffolding," over time. %$* 250
and over time, they start to teach the kids how to do this reading so that they can let go of the handlebar and they can ride the bike on their own. %$* 250
and kids who are way behind grade level, including kids who are special education students, are never going to make progress if we don't challenge them with those grade level texts. %$* 250
this is what the evidence says, and the common core looks at the evidence. %$* 250
rick hess. %$* 13
rick hess to respond. %$* 13
he's wisely letting the applause die down before he speaks. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 252
mike, i hate to step on the applause line, but actually i think you conflated two things. %$* 252
you conflated close reading and lexile. %$* 252
these are not the same thing. %$* 252
what's a lexile? %$* 13
a lexile is gauging how complicated a piece of reading is-- %$* 252
a piece of literature. %$* 252
look, close reading is a particular theory of how kids should read. %$* 252
david coleman, president of the college board, the lead writer on the english language arts standard, liked to talk about close reading as teaching kids to read like a detective and write like a journalist. %$* 252
frankly, i think that sounds perfectly fine as one piece of how we teach children to read. %$* 252
i don't think that i'm a particular fan of the idea that every child in america from grades k to 12 ought to learn to write like a journalist. %$* 252
right, but rick, is that actually in the standards? %$* 250
do the standards say that? %$* 250
no. %$* 250
what the standards say is that children need to read at grade level proficiently. %$* 250
well, mike, wait a minute. %$* 252
this is, i think, the degree of ambiguity in the common core that drives a lot of people crazy, that at one level the common core is just a bunch of innocuous words on paper, you know, one of the eighth grade reading standards, "compare and contrast the structure of two or more texts and analyze how the deferring structure of each text contributes to its meaning and style." this isn't very different from what most states previously had. %$* 252
these are a bunch of pleasant words on paper. %$* 252
i have no particular objection to them. %$* 252
the significance of the common core is that the advocates for the common core and the people who are designing the test talk very explicitly about, as carol said, these instructional shifts, which have not been publicly debated, which got little public airing as 40-odd states rushed to adopt the common core in 2009, 2010, and which portend a dramatic shift in how we teach 50 million children reading and math. %$* 252
all right. %$* 13
i'm not sure these are bad things, but i sure as heck think we ought to find out more before we embrace them. %$* 252
but when there is evidence-- %$* 250
mike petrilli. %$* 13
as we have now in early reading-- %$* 250
there was evidence 20 years ago on phonics-- %$* 250
on phonemic awareness, that was finally incorporated into our schools-- %$* 250
now we have good evidence that these level texts, just having kids who are fifth graders reading first grade texts over and over again, has not been working. %$* 250
now we have that evidence. %$* 250
it's time to follow the evidence. %$* 250
and that's what common core does. %$* 250
not every point has that, but where there is evidence-- %$* 250
we know that calculator use in the first grade, not a good idea. %$* 250
the common cores says we should not be using calculators till the kids get older. %$* 250
these are dramatically more evidence based than the standards that came before. %$* 250
hang on one second. %$* 13
carol burris. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 251
i think it's really easy for you to say, mike, "well, this is what the evidence shows." i guess what i'm going to say to you is, "show me the evidence," because what i-- %$* 251
common core is wrong about literacy in many ways, okay? %$* 251
in 2013 has pointed out test complexity is based on the erroneous notion that we must ramp up test difficulty beginning in third grade in order to achieve college and career readiness. %$* 251
kylene beers and robert probst-- %$* 251
these are university professors in reading, their excellent book, notice and note, worries that text dependent questions in close reading will lead to student disengagement in reading. %$* 251
piano, 2013, has shown that the elimination of work-play stations may harm the development of oral language so vital for these learners. %$* 251
these are all people in the research community and in schools saying, "this does not work." i have never-- %$* 251
all right, carol, let-- %$* 13
seen the evidence that level checks do not work. %$* 251
that's exactly the question i wanted to take to mike. %$* 13
your response to this %$* 13
yeah, yeah, no. %$* 250
well, i will be happy to go find it for you after this debate. %$* 250
i don't have it with me. %$* 250
but, look, here's the question-- %$* 250
but you're confident that it exists? %$* 13
i-- %$* 250
no, i'm absolutely confident. %$* 250
look, this has been the dominant way we have taught reading now for decades. %$* 250
and you look at our achievement in reading, and it is mostly flat. %$* 250
and you look at our achievement in reading for special education kids, for kids who are behind, and what you find is that they are not making progress fast enough. %$* 250
we've done better in math where we've made greater progress, particularly for poor kids, but in reading it's been slow. %$* 250
we've made some progress in teaching early reading because of phonics and phonemic awareness because there we finally followed the evidence. %$* 250
all right. %$* 13
and what i'm saying is that we need to follow the evidence. %$* 250
the common core is saying that's what we need to do, follow the evidence. %$* 250
kids deserve to be challenged. %$* 250
the teachers i talk to today, you know-- %$* 250
i mean, carol's argument earlier-- %$* 250
the four words, "these are too hard," right? %$* 250
all right, let me-- %$* 13
mike, let me-- %$* 13
i want to move on to-- %$* 13
in terms of evidence, earlier when the question of evidence came up, carmel martin, you started talking about the evidence so far in places where it has been implemented, how it's doing, and i cut you off because we weren't at that point. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 249
i want to hear now, what's the evidence that it's working in places where it's in place? %$* 13
well, first, i just want to finish mike's thought there. %$* 249
i mean, when we talked to teachers today, they acknowledge that when the standards were first brought to their schools, they were concerned that they would be too hard for their children, but we heard things like reports that teachers said, "wow, i didn't think they'd be able to do it and they are," and talk about the joy that they've had in seeing their children meet that challenge. %$* 249
and i have to say, as a former civil rights attorney, it just makes me very nervous when people talk about how, you know, you need to-- %$* 249
okay. %$* 13
some kids can't reach the same expectations as other kids. %$* 249
all right, all right. %$* 13
can i jump in? %$* 251
yeah, i want to let carol burris respond. %$* 13
i am the last person on the planet that would ever say, "some kids can't." i run an integrated high school, 16 percent of our kids are on free or reduced price lunch, and every one of them tomorrow who are 12th graders will walk into an international baccalaureate english class. %$* 251
so, that's-- %$* 251
this is not about it being hard, it's about it being wrong. %$* 251
that's what it's about. %$* 251
it's about it being appropriate. %$* 251
carmel, do you want to respond to that point before we move on? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 249
please do. %$* 13
yeah, like i said earlier the point-- %$* 249
the example that carol made about being able to count to one-- %$* 249
to 100 in ones and tens, i know lots of five-year olds who can do that. %$* 249
and i think that if we ask children coming from all different backgrounds to be able to do that, they'll be able to do that. %$* 249
and, you know, i think that we have lots of evidence that we're-- %$* 249
what we're asking them to do under the old standards wasn't working, that-- %$* 249
let me-- %$* 13
let me bring a question to your opponents because it's something about your opening statements that i either didn't understand or confused me. %$* 13
it sounded-- %$* 13
i felt i was hearing a mixed message. %$* 13
i was hearing from you, carol, "these standards are too high," for kids in kindergarten. %$* 13
and i was hearing from rick, "these standards are too low," and i'm not sure which way you're going on this. %$* 13
rick, do you want to take it, or carol? %$* 13
i'd be happy to take it. %$* 251
it's not a matter of too high or too low, it's a matter of silly and not right. %$* 251
for example, in the early grades, there are a lot of standards that are not developmentally appropriate, but then when you go up to the high school level, which rick was talking about-- %$* 251
i mean, i was talking with my math teachers today. %$* 251
we have to implement common core geometry. %$* 251
well, what does it do? %$* 251
it's a whole different course in geometry based on constructions. %$* 251
well, it worked out really well for the early greeks, but it is not an effective strategy today. %$* 251
we actually tried it in our school a couple years ago in anticipation of the common core, and the kids were lost. %$* 251
trigonometry has been stripped out of the algebra 2 class. %$* 251
since i went to school back in, i hate to admit it, the 1960s, trigonometry was part of the course of studies in high school. %$* 251
common core has changed it. %$* 251
it's not algebra 2. so the problems that you hear is not, "it's too hard," or, "it's too soft," it's just not right at a variety of levels. %$* 251
okay, and i want to take-- %$* 13
i want to move to that-- %$* 13
and so your point being it's wonky in many ways? %$* 13
yes. %$* 251
fair enough. %$* 13
it can be wonky in many ways, and your point would hold up. %$* 13
i want to take to mike petrilli because you were talking in your opening statement about the nature of testing. %$* 13
and you were saying that there's-- %$* 13
"i sense a technology of testing that's better than it used to be." %$* 13
right. %$* 250
testing is one of the things that parents are most upset about. %$* 13
not only are they confused about the work that they’re doing, they’re very, very upset about the testing processes. %$* 13
what is your response to those parents? %$* 13
right, is that their concerns are very well founded, as are the concerns of many educators who have been complaining for years, decades now, that the tests we’ve been using to judge schools are not well designed. %$* 250
and they’re right. %$* 250
those tests by and large have been very inexpensive tests. %$* 250
they’ve been set at a low level. %$* 250
they’ve been fill in the blank. %$* 250
and now we finally have this opportunity to move to much better tests with the common core, that are under development, that are coming this spring for the very first time in about half of the country. %$* 250
and this is our opportunity to now address many of those concerns. %$* 250
and for example, these tests will have a lot more writing on them than most of the other tests had. %$* 250
it’s very hard to test kids’ critical thinking skills if it’s just multiple choice. %$* 250
right, certainly hard to test their writing skills. %$* 250
yet a state like georgia has been trying to get by with a test that costs eight dollars per kid and therefore doesn’t have any writing on it. %$* 250
and what we’re trying to do here is to turn that page. %$* 250
and say look, there were major problems with the test under the no child left behind era. %$* 250
we’ve heard those concerns and now we’re trying to get something better, something that i think that carol and rick have supported in the past. %$* 250
i’d appreciate it if rick, if you want to step in, because we haven’t heard from you in a bit. %$* 13
and you look like you’re steaming over there. %$* 13
if you want to defer to your partner, please do. %$* 13
no, i always look that way. %$* 252
two thoughts, one on testing and one just on the prior question. %$* 252
one, you know john, one way to think about this is it’s really we’re debating embrace the common core. %$* 252
again i’m not declaring the common core to be atrocious or malicious. %$* 252
i am suggesting that the standard of proof for the common core is much higher than for old state standards. %$* 252
massachusetts had had state standards in place for 18 years, give or take. %$* 252
those standards had produced substantial and sustained improvements in student learning. %$* 252
if what mike and carmel had been advocating for, was taking these standards whose tires we’ve kicked for 15 or more years, and taking those national, i would have been very open to that. %$* 252
the idea that we have a bunch of design hypotheses about what kids should know, we think, maybe, and how they should learn it, maybe. %$* 252
the idea that we want to roll this out for 50 million children with little opportunity to see how this plays out or what it means, leaves me remarkably nervous. %$* 252
so for me-- %$* 252
so, for me it’s less about too high or too low. %$* 252
i think frankly we just don’t know. %$* 252
on the testing point, i mean, like i said at the beginning, i’m with mike. %$* 252
i’m for good tests. %$* 252
i’m anti-bad tests. %$* 252
mike and i are on the same page here. %$* 252
but i think the notion that the common core tests are good is an open question. %$* 252
okay i want to remind you that we are in a question and answer section of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan your moderator and we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, embrace the common core. %$* 13
let’s go to some audience questions. %$* 13
again if you raise your hand and wait, a microphone will be brought down to you and we’d like you to stand up. %$* 13
and hold the mic about fist distance from your mouth for good broadcast quality right in the center there. %$* 13
and if you stand up, a mic will find you. %$* 13
coming, it’s coming from your right hand side. %$* 13
so really nice, tight, do me proud, good question. %$* 13
hi, my name is nareda and i’m not a teacher or an educator. %$* 19
i’m actually janelle. %$* 19
i went to smith college and then later to oxford university and my first year at smith was tough. %$* 19
so my question is about the next generation learning tests. %$* 19
how do or do not, how do they measure critical thinking skills, with the caveat that pisa, the countries that score the highest in pisa are using multiple choice straight answer tests? %$* 19
let me ask you if you could rephrase your question in a way that lets him convince you to embrace the common core. %$* 13
so, are you saying are these next generation tests the key, the secret, are they going to save it? %$* 13
i want to know more about them. %$* 19
exactly, we want next generation exams that are no longer simple to answer. %$* 19
but how do they actually, what role do they play in actually measuring critical thinking skills and developing them so that we have a standard? %$* 19
can i rephrase your question to be-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 19
tell us why these next generation tests are working and why therefore we should embrace the common core. %$* 13
that’s the gist of your question? %$* 13
exactly that. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
carmel martin. %$* 13
i would say the common core standards very much drive towards teaching and assessment that is focused on creating problem solvers and good communicators, those kinds of skills. %$* 249
and we heard just today from a group of teachers that we talked to, that under the new assessments, they can’t teach to the tests anymore, because the tests are no longer about rote memorization. %$* 249
it’s about children being able to make inferences and digest the texts, so i think it goes exactly to the point that you mentioned. %$* 249
the crafters of the common core did look at at pisa.they also looked at massachusetts and they did borrow from places where they thought it was working, as well as looking into the evidence, so i think it really tackles the issue that you're talking about very effectively. %$* 249
and i think assessments aligned to those kinds of standards should really help us move away from a mode of rote memorization towards teaching in an enriched way. %$* 249
carol burris. %$* 13
i think it's always helpful to have an example. %$* 251
here's what's called the research simulation task. %$* 251
the research simulation task-- %$* 251
this is from parcc-- %$* 251
is an assessment component worthy of student preparation because it asks students to exercise the career and college readiness skills of observation, deduction, and proper use and evaluation of evidence across text types. %$* 251
in this test, students will analyze an informational topic presented through several articles, multimedia stimuli, the first text being an anchor text. %$* 251
students will engage with the text by answering a series of questions and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to write two analytic essays. %$* 251
i think that sounds great. %$* 251
grade 3. that was grade 3. you know what? %$* 251
if kids can do that at the end of grade 3, i can retire. %$* 251
just give them calculus in fourth grade and send all those doogie howsers off to college. %$* 251
another question? %$* 13
kelly posner-gerstenhaber, columbia university. %$* 19
now, we all know that every child deserves the right education, but many think tanks and thought leaders talk about one of the most critical issues in our nation is-- %$* 19
is talent development. %$* 19
and the future of our country actually depends on not ignoring them anymore. %$* 19
and by the way, the low-income high achieving kid is probably the most underserved kid in our nation. %$* 19
it's been said that-- %$* 19
but i need-- %$* 13
i need you to-- %$* 13
zero into your question. %$* 13
i'm getting there. %$* 19
in states where there's-- %$* 19
no. %$* 13
no. %$* 13
i need you to get there right now. %$* 13
right. %$* 19
i'm getting there right now. %$* 19
in states that are doing better, common core is actually going to bring them down. %$* 19
so i was wondering what you thought, how common core actually addresses the needs of this underserved group. %$* 19
carmel martin. %$* 13
sure. %$* 249
i would say there have been analysis comparing the common core to the high- achieving states, like massachusetts, and shown that they are comparable and higher in some respects. %$* 249
so, i-- %$* 249
and i think if you look at-- %$* 249
talk to the folks in massachusetts-- %$* 249
just as an example-- %$* 249
they feel like the common core is helping them to serve all their students-- %$* 249
because they're focused on development as skills, again, and not just rote memorization and test preparation, that it's helping-- %$* 249
we heard this today as well, but it's helping children across the spectrum in terms of where they start. %$* 249
i started saying earlier, kentucky is one of the first states to implement the common core. %$* 249
in just one year, their high school graduates ready for college and career jumped from 34 percent to 47 percent. %$* 249
and that's still not good enough, but that shows clear progress. %$* 249
you-- %$* 249
also in new york, this year, again, slow progress, but since implementation of the common core, there has been increase in performance. %$* 249
and the best increase has been among minority populations. %$* 249
three to four percentage points for african american and hispanic students here in new york. %$* 249
rick has a response. %$* 13
sure. %$* 252
i mean, one, carmel-- %$* 252
i mean, i think this point about massachusetts, if i recall right, mike, for instance, has argued that the massachusetts standards were better-- %$* 252
or at least as good as the common core. %$* 252
so, yet-- %$* 252
i think let's be careful about imputing claims to the common core. %$* 252
even folks who support them, i think, tend to be more measured about how good they think they are. %$* 252
second, the kentucky point-- %$* 252
the fact that you've got more kids scoring proficient doesn't mean anything whatsoever. %$* 252
you can adjust a cut score in any direction you want. %$* 252
this has always been the concern with post-no child left behind testing. %$* 252
so, the fact that kentucky scores went up doesn't tell us a thing unless we know how kentucky is setting the score and %$* 252
by-- %$* 13
this and by cut score, you mean make-- %$* 13
the score at which you make the cut to pass or fail? %$* 13
that's correct. %$* 252
or to graduate or not graduate. %$* 13
that's correct. %$* 252
okay. %$* 13
let's go on to another question. %$* 13
right down in front here. %$* 13
if anybody is raising their hands in the back, i've got to-- %$* 13
or upstairs, i can't see you, so i just want to ask you to come down a few steps please. %$* 13
sure. %$* 19
so i understand this-- %$* 19
can you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
oh. %$* 19
effie fisch i understand the side arguing against-- %$* 19
has posed a lot of criticisms on the common core tests. %$* 19
but i want to go back to something that you had said in your opening remarks, about if we accepted that position, what would we be accepting in its place? %$* 19
is it a national test based on the massachusetts standard? %$* 19
is it going back to different state standards? %$* 19
would we just be kind of waiting and hoping something came along better? %$* 19
what would happen if we don't embrace the common core? %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
that's a great question. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
you want to take it? %$* 13
so, you know, my response would be, "look" i think not embracing the common core says that if there are states where parents and educators and policymakers are sufficiently enthused about the work-- %$* 252
i think there's eight or 12 or 15 of these-- %$* 252
i think they should proceed. %$* 252
and they can go down that road, and we can see how well it works and see what the results are. %$* 252
i think in other states we should absolutely, as mike suggested, get the federal government the heck out of this question through no child left behind waivers or anything else. %$* 252
we should feel comfortable with states either choosing to revert to the standards they had in place, highly regarded previous standards like massachusetts', d.c.'s, indiana's, or california's, because, remember, nobody hit the delete button on those old standards, on the curricula that matched, or on those assessments. %$* 252
i think it makes sense, before one does a dramatic and bold remaking of 50-- %$* 252
of the schools serving 50 million kids, that we actually move deliberately and carefully for once and see how this works and what unanticipated changes lurk. %$* 252
mike petrilli. %$* 13
well, you know, i know rick spends a lot of his time writing books in a cave somewhere. %$* 250
i think he's been in a cave perhaps-- %$* 250
because rick is 2014. teachers have been implementing these standards for four years in these states, okay? %$* 250
so, you know, there are enormous-- %$* 250
let him go on, and then i'll come back to you. %$* 13
you know, there are enormous, enormous costs, financial, morale issues. %$* 250
you know, teachers have put their heart and soul into teaching these standards-- %$* 250
i mean, we heard from some of these teachers today-- %$* 250
for four years. %$* 250
so let's be clear that this is not now a hypothetical argument, "should we move forward? %$* 250
should we adopt the common core? %$* 250
" schools have adopted it. %$* 250
they're moving forward. %$* 250
and so now the question is, "should we go back and undo all the work of the last four years? %$* 250
"and you've held this very high bar, both you and carol today, that basically the common core have to be remarkable in order to go ahead. %$* 250
so if you're going to go back to those old standards, those lower standards, in the vast majority of states, what is your evidence that we should move to those lower standards? %$* 250
why aren't you having a high bar for that? %$* 250
carol burris. %$* 13
you know, your argument basically is, "we're stuck now," i mean, but-- %$* 13
and that, i find to be a very frightening-- %$* 251
carol burris. %$* 13
i find to be a very frightening argument. %$* 251
i-- %$* 251
you know, i don't live in the world of talking points where i have to worry about changing my mind. %$* 251
i live in the world of kids, and i see what the common core standards are doing to kids. %$* 251
i hear my teachers come in. %$* 251
i don't know what group of teachers you're talking to, but they're very different than the ones that i work with every day who come in, showing me bizarre worksheets, who tell me their children don't want to go to school anymore, that they hate school, that they want to be able to read interesting books instead of technical manuals. %$* 251
you know, we're really resilient smart people, teachers. %$* 251
please don't think that we could not adjust. %$* 251
i've lived through four sets of standards since i've been in education. %$* 251
we can do it. %$* 251
we can do the work. %$* 251
we need the federal government to back off, and we need to have dialogues within our states where we take-- %$* 251
maybe we start with the common core. %$* 251
we clean up what's a mess, and we make them actually better. %$* 251
you know, there is something about competition that is not a bad thing. %$* 251
if we are all doing the same thing in every state and doing it the same way, where will the new ideas come from? %$* 251
i really see the changes in my high school. %$* 251
and they're not positive. %$* 251
this matter of-- %$* 13
this matter of going back at this point reminds me as i was reading on this, one republican governor who was very enthusiastic about this. %$* 13
and then i guess put his finger in the wind and became very unenthusiastic about it. %$* 13
i paraphrase him, but he said, "it's never too late to make the right decision." i want to remind you we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this motion, "embrace the common core." let's go back to audience questions. %$* 13
anybody farther up who i'm not seeing? %$* 13
sir, right there. %$* 13
if you look to your left, he's coming that way. %$* 13
if you could tell us your name again, please. %$* 13
hi, my name's trevor. %$* 18
i went into a private school where we didn't have a lot of testing. %$* 18
and i found out my motivations for learning were genuine and a little more self- motivated, so the nature of just testing itself, i want to know numbers, quantitatively how much testing is there in the common core to be expected, and also what do you think that those specifically for the morale and-- %$* 18
of the students and also the teachers? %$* 18
carmel martin. %$* 13
well, i don't have the exact numbers in terms of how much time will be spent testing, but it is my hope that under these new better fairer fewer assessments under the common core that we can eliminate a lot of the testing that happens around the country under the old set of standards and assessments, what we see across the country is districts layering on additional assessments on top. %$* 249
and i think as we move towards these better assessments under the common core that we can eliminate unnecessary testing. %$* 249
i think testing is a tough issue. %$* 249
it's something-- %$* 249
my kids hate it, and i have to explain to them why they have to do it and how it provides really valuable information to their teachers about how they're doing so they can help them to do better, just like when i bring my child to the doctor and they say, "i really don't want to get that shot," sometimes you have to do things that aren't very pleasant. %$* 249
i think what's important is to make sure that in creating a culture around testing, we're not making children stressed out, we're not making them cry over the tests. %$* 249
and i think that part of that is professional development, the environment in the school around the tests. %$* 249
we heard that-- %$* 249
we heard that from some teachers we talked to today about how that's-- %$* 249
and that takes a lot of leadership in the school to make sure that it is being used as a tool to get better. %$* 249
i think carol has made a lot of good points about the way assessments are being used, that we really should take a closer look at that-- %$* 249
they do help create a negative culture around testing. %$* 249
but again, that's about how the tests are used, not what the standards should be and whether you should have the assessments so you can learn from them and improve practice. %$* 249
carol burris. %$* 13
yeah, in new york state, testing was increasing anyway, but under the common core it's gotten worse. %$* 251
you're talking about increases of 200 percent, for example, at some of the grade levels. %$* 251
you're talking about three days of ela testing, three days of math testing, and a lot of it is really because of not only the common core itself, but also the policies that were also part of the department of education that carmel worked for. %$* 251
so, that teachers now are evaluated by test scores which then added a lot of other additional tests. %$* 251
all of these things have come together at once, and kids are crying. %$* 251
i've had colleagues who-- %$* 251
they've had kids who've wet their pants. %$* 251
you know, kids want to do well on tests. %$* 251
they want to please their teachers. %$* 251
they want to please their parents. %$* 251
and when they find themselves reading and rereading paragraphs in order to do close readings and flipping back and forth, some of them really just start to give up. %$* 251
you know, in new york, we had 60,000 kids opt out of testing last year. %$* 251
we never had that. %$* 251
we never had that before. %$* 251
another question. %$* 13
i'm just trying to look farther up in the back. %$* 13
right up against the wall there. %$* 13
hi, good evening. %$* 19
my name is pamela. %$* 19
i'm a new york city department of education teacher. %$* 19
i've been teaching since the late '70s. %$* 19
you know, through all of our professional development and graduate programs, we're always talking about differentiated instruction and how important this is for our special needs students, ela students, esl students, regular ed students. %$* 19
everybody learns differently. %$* 19
we all know this. %$* 19
there's been a hierarchy of learning for all those years. %$* 19
my question is how does adhering to the common core advance the progress of teaching with differentiated instruction to support the way that students learn and the way that they test because, as you said, not all students test well. %$* 19
okay, you actually had a question mark, and i'm going to land it there. %$* 13
yes, i did. %$* 19
so i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to go-- %$* 13
yes, thank you. %$* 19
thank you for the question. %$* 13
go to mike petrilli. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 250
that's a great question. %$* 250
you know, this is key. %$* 250
and we've had these debates for a long time. %$* 250
just to say that, you know, standards does not have to equal standardization, right? %$* 250
we want to make sure that our education system is linked to success for what comes next, and that means that if we're measuring student progress, this should be against the real world and what they're going to have. %$* 250
but that does not mean that we have a standard way of getting there. %$* 250
different schools have different approaches, different teachers have different approaches, and different kids are going to learn different ways, and that's all absolutely appropriate. %$* 250
what we don't want to have is a system that has standards that are set so low that we're giving the false impression that kids are doing fine when they're not. %$* 250
and, you know, carol, i know you keep saying, "well, it's not too high, it's not too low, it's just wrong." go back to those old systems, okay? %$* 250
colorado, before they adopted the common core, for example, you could score at the 10th percentile in reading in colorado and be considered proficient, okay? %$* 250
so you would get a report as a parent that your child is proficient. %$* 250
that's great. %$* 250
okay, what you didn't know was that, that meant that 90 percent of the kids at that same grade level nationwide were reading better than you were. %$* 250
that meant that you weren't ever even close to being on grade level. %$* 250
that is the system that we had, and that is the system that state states that are thinking about pulling out the common core, which is mostly in these red states, with big tea party influence. %$* 250
that is what they are going back, that’s what this is about, that’s why we need to keep moving forward. %$* 250
rick hess. %$* 13
so mike, first that’s not an accurate characterization of what it means to be a common core state. %$* 252
as you well know, lots of common core states are making up their own tests. %$* 252
they are choosing their own cut score. %$* 252
nothing of significance has changed from under nclb.so imputing this great virtue. %$* 252
secondly these statistical gains can be played both ways. %$* 252
james milgram, professor emeritus at stanford, one of the five members of the common core validation committee who refused to sign off on the quality of the common core, has pointed out that if you look at federal data for instance. %$* 252
that students who only go through algebra ii, only 40 percent of them ever complete a four year college degree. %$* 252
whereas 75 percent of students who take pre-calculus, which those old colorado standards had, go on to complete a college degree. %$* 252

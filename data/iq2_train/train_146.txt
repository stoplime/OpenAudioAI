let him answer. %$* 13
you know, the united states was just as vulnerable as israel. %$* 425
we had 24,000 nuclear weapons locked in on us. %$* 425
they would have damaged us just as badly as half a dozen on israel. %$* 425
the result would have been the same. %$* 425
and it probably would have been worse for the rest of the world; indeed it would have been catastrophic for the world as a whole. %$* 425
and we lived with that for 40 years. %$* 425
and all of these problems with launch on warning-- %$* 425
now, i quite take the fact that these regimes don't have the controlled mechanisms, the command and control or even the technologies that will make this a safer world. %$* 425
and so i fully acknowledge that there's an element of risk there. %$* 425
i fully acknowledge that israel shouldn't live with a nuclear iran if there's a better option. %$* 425
i'm just arguing that there may not be a better option. %$* 425
shmuel bar. %$* 13
yeah, well, first of all regarding rationalism and khomeini. %$* 427
khomeini, two years after the iraqi invasion of iran, he could have signed an agreement. %$* 427
he could have stopped the war, but he continued with the war. %$* 427
and the reason that he finally agreed to a ceasefire was because the revolutionary guards actually imposed it on him. %$* 427
the other thing is that iran isn't like china which was going through a process when it acquired nuclear weapons. %$* 427
china was already moderating its revolutionary zeal. %$* 427
iran is going through what we would call the second generation of the revolution. %$* 427
i mean, we're already in this sort of robespierre style second generation of the iranian revolution going back to the pure concepts of the revolution. %$* 427
now, but that really isn't the real issue here. %$* 427
the real issue here, i think, is that analogies are absolutely irrelevant. %$* 427
you never walk into the same stream in the same place twice. %$* 427
and certainly when one stream is in china and the other is in the middle east. %$* 427
secondly, the dynamics of multilateral nuclear states is completely different to the dynamics of two main %$* 427
let me remind you, it was not bilateral. %$* 426
it was tri-lateral. %$* 426
china was for '64. %$* 426
china never had the strategic capabilities of the soviet union, and the chinese didn't have the missile capabilities at the time. %$* 427
and most of the cold war was clearly a warsaw pact against nato. it was clearly bilateral. %$* 427
so the fact that nominally you also have britain and france, et cetera, and you have china, that did not make it multilateral. %$* 427
so it doesn't matter, though, because we're not talking-- %$* 427
and as a historian, i find it difficult to discuss analogies because we think that stories tend to think that god is in the details. %$* 427
and the details on the middle east is that we will have a poly-nuclear middle east where we will have a sunni world which is going to see a shiite nuclear power as an existential threat to the sunni world. %$* 427
anybody who's read the best seller in saudi arabia, "the protocols of the elders of qom," which tells how the elders of qom wanted to destroy mecca and medina, realize that they see this as existential as well. %$* 427
and so we have to understand that this is the situation. %$* 427
this situation does not auger well for stability. %$* 427
all right. %$* 13
let me put a different-- %$* 13
bring in a different strain of the argument here. %$* 13
to the side that's arguing that israel can live with a nuclear iran, your opponents have pointed out that the specific rhetoric of the iranian regime has discussed a deep aspiration to see israel gone, wiping israel off the map. %$* 13
reuven pedatzur, why not take that absolutely literally? %$* 13
by the way, they’ve never threatened israel with nuclear weapons, never. %$* 426
never-- %$* 426
never. %$* 426
you never find one-- %$* 426
very quickly, very quickly-- %$* 13
no, no, because-- %$* 426
do you concede the point that they have never threatened to use nuclear weapons against israel? %$* 13
they don't admit that they are developing the weapons, so how can they threaten? %$* 426
anybody who reads the materials coming out of media which is related to the iranian revolutionary guard, i'm not even going back to rafsanjani with his famous statement. %$* 427
but very senior iranian people connected to khamenei have made allusions which could clearly be understood that way. %$* 427
all right. %$* 13
that's different from-- %$* 13
reuven is saying they've never explicitly said, we will get a nuclear weapon and use it to destroy israel. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 428
if the ayatollah khamenei's aide, rahimian is saying that he's going to replace israel with a big holocaust, i don't think they're putting pumpkins on the catapults. %$* 428
you know, i mean, i don't think you have to stretch it-- %$* 428
so this is the rhetoric. %$* 426
this is the rhetoric for other reasons. %$* 426
they are not going-- %$* 426
so they're saying that they don't mean it. %$* 13
if they could do it, they would have done it. %$* 426
but they don't mean they are going to use the nuclear weapons in order to achieve this goal, no. %$* 426
no way. %$* 426
i beg to differ. %$* 427
i just-- %$* 427
shmuel bar. %$* 13
i think that one of the problems-- %$* 427
and this, i must say-- %$* 427
we as israelis tend to believe people who say that they want to exterminate us. %$* 427
we have some very, very good historic precedence-- %$* 427
that somebody said they want to exterminate us and they tried to do it. %$* 427
so you-- %$* 426
so i don't-- %$* 427
i-- %$* 427
so khamenei is hitler? %$* 426
i don't believe in rhetoric. %$* 427
i think that rhetoric becomes action when it can become action. %$* 427
reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
so you believe that the minute they'll have the weapons, they'll try to-- %$* 426
no, i didn't say that. %$* 427
destroy israel. %$* 426
no, i didn't say that. %$* 427
i said that given circumstances in which there will be escalation, that no party in this region will be able to prevent-- %$* 427
will have dominance-- %$* 427
i don't agree, because what will happen, it's what happened between the two super powers. %$* 426
it won't. %$* 427
means of communication will develop. %$* 426
let me bring-- %$* 13
we haven't heard from jim dobbins for a couple of minutes. %$* 13
and jim, for you also this question: if the iranians are so explicit about their desire to see israel gone, whether they use an active verb or passive verb, should the israelis not take that literal-- %$* 13
with literal seriousness? %$* 13
and can you come close to your mic? %$* 13
i mean, i think what-- %$* 425
a benign explanation, and i'm not arguing that one should necessarily accept the benign explanation, is that the iranians are simply arguing for a multi-ethnic state, encompassing all of historic israel, to include the west bank, which is the hamas position, for instance. %$* 425
it's not that the israelis should go away. %$* 425
it's that israel should go away and that a multi-ethnic state encompassing both palestinians and israelis should continue to exist. %$* 425
interestingly enough, there are extremists, but viable parties in israel who also think that the israeli state should encompass all of the west bank. %$* 425
okay so-- %$* 13
the difference is that they think it should be a jewish state, whereas the iranians would argue it should be a multi-ethnic state. %$* 425
well, jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
just very briefly on that. %$* 428
what will happen was israel's enemies realized that-- %$* 428
talking about pushing the jews into the sea was not really a great pr strategy. %$* 428
so what they did was they changed the language, and they said, we don't want to push the jews in the sea. %$* 428
we just want to get rid of israel as a jewish homeland and let everybody live there together. %$* 428
but then they also say, as the a toll laws say, all the jews who aren't from there have to go back to where they're from, which leads to these incredible statements, and i heard this from many iranian officials-- %$* 428
from. %$* 426
the jewish should go back. %$* 428
the jews from germany should go back to germany. %$* 428
the jews from poland should go back to poland. %$* 428
but, jeffrey, i think what jim is saying that is the-- %$* 13
you could interpret the-- %$* 13
and i'm not saying this facetiously-- %$* 13
the iranians are-- %$* 13
they're not saying, we will kill you. %$* 13
they're saying we want you dead, which is not exactly the same thing, which has to do with-- %$* 13
we want a lot of you dead, and we certainly want your country and your dream of a jewish homeland dead. %$* 428
so, you know, to israelis and to jewish people-- %$* 428
but it means, would they be the agents of that killing? %$* 13
were they able to get away with it. %$* 427
but i-- %$* 427
they already tried, john. %$* 428
they already tried. %$* 428
they can’t get away with it. %$* 426
they already tried. %$* 428
wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
i love it when everybody is talking at once. %$* 13
starting with. %$* 13
well, you go first, shmuel, then you, reuven. %$* 13
i know a thing or two about hamas, and i read their websites avidly. %$* 427
maybe that's an aberration. %$* 427
and their main website, they have constantly the hadith from the prophet saying that the last day will not come until the muslims kill all the jews and the last jew will hide behind a rock or a stone, and the rock will call out, "muslim, there is a jew hiding behind me, come and kill him." now, i don't call this a multi-ethnic-- %$* 427
that’s very liberal. %$* 428
a multi-ethnic state. %$* 427
this is constantly-- %$* 427
environmental. %$* 428
and they have these on their tv, you have children called up to quote it, and they get prizes for quoting things like that-- %$* 427
if you've seen this website yourself? %$* 426
reuven pedatzur. %$* 13
talking about – rhetoric. %$* 426
we're not arguing, by the way, that the lubavitchers should get nuclear weapons. %$* 428
i mean, you know-- %$* 428
i have a general-- %$* 428
i have a general predisposition against letting nut job religious fundamentalists, that's the technical term-- %$* 428
all stripes, get hold of nuclear weapons. %$* 428
it's a pretty simple point. %$* 428
it's very nice if they don't have the weapons, but if they have, then what? %$* 426
then what? %$* 426
yes. %$* 426
i think we already described what could happen. %$* 428
then israel will our time. %$* 426
i'm going to come to you in the audience for questions shortly. %$* 13
i just want you to get ready. %$* 13
folks, if you're upstairs, i won't be able to call on you, but if you want to ask a question, come on down, and just stand in the back. %$* 13
and i'll see that you came downstairs, and i'll try to call on you for making the effort. %$* 13
i would really urge you to make these questions really, really brief and to form them as questions, not debating points, but as questions. %$* 13
and you'll know it's a question if a question mark goes at the end of what you say-- %$* 13
let it be on this point. %$* 13
we're not debating whether the israeli government should launch an attack in iran. %$* 13
we're trying to debate a-- %$* 13
a little bit of it has been put before - - as the day after, what would be the consequences for israel of iran getting a nuclear weapon. %$* 13
and so as you're getting ready to do that, i just want to go back to the side that's arguing that israel cannot live with a nuclear weapon and point out that your opponent, jim dobbins, made the point that-- %$* 13
he asked "what actually would the iranians be able to start doing that they're not already doing in terms of killing jews around the world, and in terms of encouraging attacks from hamas and hezbollah, and being generally mischievous and deadly? %$* 13
what would be different if they had a nuclear weapon? %$* 13
jeff goldberg. %$* 13
they have limitless escalation. %$* 428
like i said, if hamas has the protection of the nuclear umbrella-- %$* 428
the iranian nuclear umbrella, it can be much bolder than it is today. %$* 428
israel will then have to-- %$* 428
doing what, more than a thousand missiles? %$* 426
yeah. %$* 428
twenty thousand? %$* 426
yeah, hezbollah has 50,000 missiles sitting in lebanon pointed at israel right now. %$* 428
jim dobbins, it was your point. %$* 13
let's hear your response to it. %$* 13
i mean, quoting from extremist websites is one thing, but as far as i know, the largest jewish population in the middle east that doesn't live in israel lives in iran. %$* 425
the largest what %$* 18
jewish population in the middle east that doesn't live in israel lives in iran. %$* 425
no, i think they're in israel. %$* 13
two hundred-- %$* 18
the largest jewish population that doesn't live in israel. %$* 425
there's 25,000-- %$* 428
okay. %$* 13
got it. %$* 13
so if they wanted to start killing jews, they'd have an easy opportunity-- %$* 425
the jews in iran are under what-- %$* 427
it's called "dhimmi," they are under protection. %$* 427
that's something else. %$* 427
but-- %$* 427
but, jim, i just-- %$* 13
jews have fled iran. %$* 428
jim, i want you to get back-- %$* 13
i want you to defend your opening point that jeffrey just refuted, that iran having a nuclear weapon wouldn't be doing much more than it's already doing. %$* 13
he says, "yes, they would, because they could escalate under protection." %$* 13
nuclear weapons are extremely useful to deter people from using other nuclear weapons or from destroying their regime. %$* 425
there was one option that the united states would lose if iran had a nuclear weapon, which it's lost with respect to north korea, and that is to invade and overthrow the regime. %$* 425
that would be off the table. %$* 425
we might do other things to them. %$* 425
we've got 5,000 nuclear weapons. %$* 425
they've got two or three. %$* 425
there's almost nothing we could do to them, short of threatening to overthrow the regime, which would cause them to use their nuclear weapons. %$* 425
and i think israel has never had the capacity of invading and overthrowing the regime, and israel's not going to use its nuclear weapons to respond to rocket attacks from hamas. %$* 425
it's got other conventional responses to that which it can fall back on whether iran has nuclear weapons or not. %$* 425
and iran is not going to start a nuclear war to protect hamas. %$* 425
i totally disagree that nuclear weapons are only for deterrence. %$* 427
they actually have only been used for deterrence in a very limited case that we know of, the cold war, but nuclear weapons can be used for compellence. %$* 427
and if you imagine iran having a certain window of opportunity when the rest of the middle east has not acquired nuclear weapons, and they do have an agenda. %$* 427
the iranians are making it clear-- %$* 427
actually, they've escalated their rhetoric about bahrain being part of iran which was stolen by the brits. %$* 427
they will probably take advantage of it to brandish nuclear weapons as a means of compellence in order to get the level of hegemony in the gulf and in the middle east before the rest of the countries do acquire nuclear weapons. %$* 427
so i think that that is the most likely scenario, so it's not only what they could do against israel, but what they do against saudi arabia, bahrain. %$* 427
we're not arguing that it's impossible. %$* 425
yeah, i'm not going to argue it's impossible-- %$* 18
there's no historic-- %$* 425
there's no historic example of successful compellence since 1945. there's no case in which a nuclear power used its nuclear power to compel some other country. %$* 425
britain and france got thrown out of every single colony they had in the world while they were nuclear powers. %$* 425
and their colonial powers weren't. %$* 425
analogies of such small effects have absolutely no scientific relevance. %$* 427
i'm bothered-- %$* 13
i'm bothered by that. %$* 13
i'm bothered by that because that gives us nothing to talk about from history. %$* 13
right. %$* 425
i mean, history-- %$* 425
we've got to-- %$* 13
we've got to look back to some degree. %$* 13
i mean, it's your response every time-- %$* 13
every time they bring up something from history, you say it's irrelevant. %$* 13
no, no. %$* 427
from history, you can bring up things from history but you have to bring up things from relevant history in a relevant region, in relevant circumstances and culture. %$* 427
what happened between-- %$* 427
so what is relevant, shmuel? %$* 426
the united states and the soviet union, france and britain-- %$* 427
shmuel, what is relevant? %$* 426
has had nothing to with what happens in a region where people are-- %$* 427
i think we're having an israeli moment here. %$* 13
shmuel, what is relevant? %$* 13
jeffrey said-- %$* 426
jeffrey said that israel will have a hard time. %$* 426
we always have a hard time. %$* 426
no, look-- %$* 428
nothing will change. %$* 426
yeah, you always have a hard time. %$* 428
some of it's self-inflicted, some of it is inflicted from outside; the proportion of the stuff that's going to be inflicted from outside is going to grow much great. %$* 428
you know, and jim dobbins is right. %$* 428
i mean, he's right. %$* 428
the day after iran gets a nuke, you know, chances are israel will still survive. %$* 428
i mean-- %$* 428
and it's a remote possibility that israel could survive two or three or four years, but i really do believe-- %$* 428
a remote possibility? %$* 425
i really do believe that iran getting a nuclear weapon-- %$* 428
and, by the way, it's not the israelis who believe it, it's the u.s. that believes this. %$* 428
whoa, jeffrey, you said two or three years israel would survive? %$* 13
i think-- %$* 428
look, i believe that every three to four-- %$* 428
let's say every three to four years, there's another confrontation between israel and one of iran's proxies on its northern border or its southern border. %$* 428
but there's nothing to do-- %$* 426
the next time there's one of these conflicts, i'm afraid that they're going to spin out of control. %$* 428
by that point, saudi arabia might have nukes, turkey might have nukes, egypt might have nukes. %$* 428
i don't see this as %$* 428
as president obama said repeatedly, that is, you know, to introduce so many nuclear weapons to such a small space that is already politically unstable, politically volatile, is a recipe for disaster. %$* 428
so when jim dobbins said this debate isn't literally saying israel can survive, you actually are taking it literally, that you think israel cannot survive. %$* 13
oh, i read the instruction sheet wrong? %$* 428
yes. %$* 13
oh really? %$* 428
no, i believe that-- %$* 428
i believe that it makes it-- %$* 428
that it makes it very, very-- %$* 428
look, israel-- %$* 428
why does israel survive and thrive now? %$* 428
it survives because it's an immigration nation. %$* 428
who's going to immigrate to a country that's on a hair-trigger nuclear alert, that lives under this iranian nuclear umbrella? %$* 428
who immigrated to the united states? %$* 426
investment. %$* 428
who's going to build a $1 billion chip plant in israel if they think that that chip is going to be blown up in a nuclear war? %$* 428
who immigrated to the united states, jeffrey, with 25,000 missiles aimed at every target in the states. %$* 426
but it was never the level of animosity-- %$* 427
and i hope that we'll survive more than three years. %$* 426
and the level of-- %$* 427
the level of conflict-- %$* 427
you know-- %$* 428
you know, you should survive forever, and that's what we're talking about. %$* 428
and i just don't see-- %$* 428
i don't see a middle east that's poly-nuclear as a hospitable place for-- %$* 428
that already has multiple dysfunctions. %$* 428
i agree, it's not a nice neighborhood. %$* 426
there's no automaticity to the-- %$* 425
jim dobbins-- %$* 13
jim we just need you near the mike, we can't hear you. %$* 13
there's no automaticity to the idea that iran's gaining nuclear weapons is going to proliferate. %$* 425
it's a risk, like these other things. %$* 425
and it's a risk that the u.s.takes seriously, which is one of the reasons why it's threatened to bomb iran. %$* 425
it's not as if there's a gulf between the israeli leadership and the leadership in washington; they both agree that they should bomb iran rather than allow it to have nuclear weapons, they just disagree about when. %$* 425
let's hear your questions. %$* 13
front row, gentleman, right here. %$* 13
and just rise and we also need-- %$* 13
folks, because of the radio broadcast, also, hold the mike about that distance from your mouth. %$* 13
and tell us your name and ask your question. %$* 13
sure. %$* 429
my name is randy and, mr. %$* 429
dobbins, the answer to your question is to mow the grass, that's what can be done. %$* 429
but i just want to follow up on mr. %$* 429
goldberg's line of thinking, which is the economic analysis, which is how many thousands of people will actually, human capital, leave israel. %$* 429
how much actual capital, billions of dollars? %$* 429
who is going to actually invest in israel given the fact there is no margin for error and not only do you have explicitly nuclear weapons pointed at you, but you also have the danger of dirty bombs and technology transfer in the-- %$* 429
okay. %$* 13
that's a great question, and it was really well done, let me just say. %$* 13
that's the model. %$* 13
go ahead, jim dobbins. %$* 13
the united states had a peer competitor that had in many cases, more nuclear weapons than we did. %$* 425
people invested. %$* 425
we had huge immigration. %$* 425
people went to new york and washington, and they knew that they were going to be exterminated if there was a war. %$* 425
they were right in the hair trigger, wherever else the bombs fell they were going to fall there. %$* 425
did it stop building? %$* 425
did it stop immigration? %$* 425
first of all, there's a difference in margin of safety. %$* 429
wait, wait. %$* 13
that’s for these guys. %$* 13
why? %$* 425
why is there a difference? %$* 425
well, they're the debaters. %$* 13
why is there a difference? %$* 425
jeffrey, you have to say, first of all, there's a margin of safety issue. %$* 13
no, seriously, i just want your question to provoke them. %$* 13
it was a great question, though, jeffrey. %$* 13
am i supposed to deal with just the economic issue? %$* 428
no, no. %$* 13
you're to respond to their response. %$* 13
i'll let shmuel do that. %$* 428
all right, shmuel. %$* 13
okay. %$* 427
if you want to pass you can. %$* 13
shmuel has the answer. %$* 428
i don't know if everybody will leave israel. %$* 427
i'll probably the one who turns off the lights at ben-gurion airport. %$* 427
but i think it is absolutely ridiculous and absurd to compare a situation in which a country which has declared that it wants to exterminate the state of israel, has nuclear weapons, as opposed to the balance which existed post cuba between the united states and the soviet union, even though they both had nuclear weapons. %$* 427
it's-- %$* 427
you can make those analogies, but they have absolutely nothing to do with reality. %$* 427
it's not-- %$* 427
it's not a real analogy. %$* 427
and i think that it would certainly have an effect-- %$* 427
by the way, an interesting poll in israel was taken, and people were asked, will you leave the country if iran gets a nuclear weapon? %$* 427
it turns out that somewhere around 30 percent of the jews said they would think about it. %$* 427
70 percent of the israeli arabs said they would think about it. %$* 427
all right. %$* 13
but, you know, your-- %$* 13
part of your question that was really good that you were getting on your follow-up didn't get out, so go-- %$* 13
mic is back to you. %$* 13
margin of error question. %$* 13
well, first of all-- %$* 429
stand up, please. %$* 13
well, first of all, there's obviously an issue of a dirty bomb or the fact there's no geographic margin of error. %$* 429
but i really think that you ignore the key issue which i was trying to address in terms of my question, which are the actual capital which has been invested in israel. %$* 429
who is going to actually invest continuously in a country where you have the threat of existential destruction? %$* 429
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
and in fact it was what-- %$* 429
a follow-up. %$* 429
the israeli economy's been thriving and has been doing tremendously well. %$* 429
but given the fact that if there is this threat that's going on, the risk of an incremental investment there is just tremendous. %$* 429
okay. %$* 13
we-- %$* 13
we get it. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
do you want to take that, reuven? %$* 13
i mean, it's a good question. %$* 13
who's going to keep going to israel, investing in israel? %$* 13
jim gave an absolutely brilliant answer. %$* 426
by comparing it to the u.s. %$* 13
but who is investing in a country when each-- %$* 426
there are 60,000 missiles aimed at? %$* 426
who invests in israel these days? %$* 426
i don't think you can compare conventional rockets to nuclear weapons. %$* 428
of course not. %$* 426
you had a lot of subtext there. %$* 13
so can you draw out what your point was? %$* 13
you put into a rhetorical question that none of us can answer. %$* 13
i believe this-- %$* 426
so make your point more explicitly. %$* 13
i believe that most of the israelis will stay in israel even if there will be a nuclear iran. %$* 426
is your point that israel is already kind of a nasty neighborhood, and there are already hamas rockets landing, and people are already investing in it? %$* 13
i don't like our neighbors, but what can i do? %$* 426
let's go to the-- %$* 13
ma'am, right there. %$* 13
if you can tell us your name as well, please. %$* 13
hi. %$* 430
quanta ahmed. %$* 430
i'm a muslim author. %$* 430
to my colleagues, mr. %$* 430
bar and mr. %$* 430
goldberg, i would say what's different and what you're arguing clearly is that the new ingredient is virulent political islamism, which both of you have touched upon, which changes the equation, not just the poly-nuclear conflict. %$* 430
i think that's what makes this so much more dangerous than anything history's previously seen in terms of the cold war. %$* 430
would you agree? %$* 430
and could you expand? %$* 430
wait. %$* 13
are you asking them-- %$* 13
you're saying you agree with them? %$* 13
i agree with them. %$* 430
but then you're asking them if they agree with you. %$* 13
and also-- %$* 430
but do you want to put that question to this side? %$* 13
as-- %$* 430
you're the moderator, but i think that's the part that's overlooked entirely. %$* 430
so turn that into a question for this side, because that i think that's what your intention really is to do? %$* 13
why do you not feel that the ingredient of political islamism, which is actually decimated so many muslim states politically and ideologically and contributes to the destabilization in pakistan, the country of my heritage, is not a destructive factor that is alien from the previous 60 years of nuclear armament. %$* 430
well-- %$* 425
jim dobbins. %$* 13
first of all, i don't-- %$* 425
you know, iran has been a very islamist state for 30 years now, 40 years? %$* 425
'79. %$* 425
'79. %$* 426
it's probably a little less virulent now than it was, but it's still a virulent islamist state. %$* 425
and yet it hasn't behaved irresponsibly in the sense of doing anything that endangers its existence. %$* 425
the regime has done lots of outrageous things. %$* 425
but none of them threatened its existence. %$* 425
none of them threatened the continuity of the regime. %$* 425
iran in fact hasn't invaded anybody for 500 years. %$* 425
so it's not as if they have territorial claims. %$* 425
they're promoting subversion. %$* 425
they're promoting overthrow of hostile regimes. %$* 425
they're engaging in terrorism. %$* 425
and i would anticipate that they would continue to do so. %$* 425
at no point has either american or israeli nuclear weapons deterred them from that. %$* 425
i don't think there's any level of that that they could engage in that would result in a nuclear strike on our part. %$* 425
and therefore, i don't think that their having nuclear weapons would particularly affect that kind of behavior, which would-- %$* 425
we would continue to have to respond to forcefully at times and certainly rigorously. %$* 425
but i don't think it would be notably harder. %$* 425
jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
and as far as islam and the arab world, or for that matter in the south asian world, i don't know that it's particularly, you know, relevant to this problem. %$* 425
it's certainly a challenge. %$* 425
jeffrey goldberg. %$* 13
well, you know, to answer the question, the saving grace-- %$* 428
one of the saving graces of the cold war was that the soviets were atheists and that they didn't-- %$* 428
they didn't envision this world as simply the anteroom to a superior afterlife. %$* 428
and so i do think you have to take into account-- %$* 428
not just with islam, but with-- %$* 428
as i said before, fundamentalist jewish parties in israel i wouldn't want to see controlling nuclear weapons. %$* 428
we're entering the age of political islamism in the middle east. %$* 428
the muslim brotherhood is in charge of egypt today. %$* 428
in another year, it's going to be in charge of syria. %$* 428
i'll answer this question with a question to the audience in a way, which is, would you be comfortable having the muslim brotherhood in egypt be in control of nuclear weapons? %$* 428
would you be comfortable having the muslim brotherhood in syria be in charge of nuclear weapons? %$* 428
and for that matter, would you-- %$* 428
would you be happy if the chief rabbis of israel had nuclear weapons? %$* 428
they have. %$* 426
they have. %$* 426
i don't know. %$* 428
the chief rabbis of israel do not have nuclear weapons. %$* 428
they-- %$* 428
i don't want people who think that this world is simply a prelude to the next to help bring us there sooner. %$* 428
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this-- %$* 13
this is a little bit that i have to do. %$* 13
i wasn't trying to be funny. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters two, teams of two debating this motion: israel can live with a nuclear iran. %$* 13
thank you for your patience. %$* 13
that's for the radio broadcast. %$* 13
let's go on to some more questions. %$* 13
ma'am, right here on the microphone, and please stand. %$* 13
tell us your name. %$* 13
my name is susan sandler. %$* 431
the camera needs to find you. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
how does each side cope with the fact of unprecedented mass media, mass communications and to put it this way, everybody will have the same problems controlling their children that we have controlling our children as time progresses and people become more educated, more affluent in all parts of the world, and-- %$* 431
and although there is an islamist revolution, there will be liberation from many dogma and many doctrines. %$* 431
ma'am, i'm not sure how your question focuses to our-- %$* 13
my question is how do they-- %$* 431
just break it down, yeah. %$* 13
cope with this progression of-- %$* 431
of idea because nothing is-- %$* 431
since nothing is static, and so the apocalyptic, the inevitable view, how do they cope with it? %$* 431
and how do you cope on the other side with change that might evolve as it's coming up-- %$* 431
as is happening with all communications? %$* 431
ma'am, with respect, i'm going to decline your question because i think it's a little bit too broad and not focused. %$* 13
but thank you. %$* 13
let's see. %$* 13
right down in the front here, gray sweater. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
just wait for the mic to come for you. %$* 13
it's being passed down on your left side. %$* 13
and if you could stand so that the camera can find you. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my question is for mr. %$* 19
goldberg. %$* 19
mr. %$* 19
goldberg-- %$* 19
please, what's your name? %$* 13
oh, farid kress many times the supreme leader has made a distinction between zionism and judaism. %$* 19
and many of the people in the regime have often said that they have nothing against judaism. %$* 19
they have a jewish mp; there's a very large synagogue that covers about four blocks in tehran; you see many jews-- %$* 19
not many, but i would say you see a few jews going around, you know, with their distinct caps-- %$* 19
ma'am, where are you going with this-- %$* 13
my question is this, is that-- %$* 19
do you really believe that the mullah-hating-- %$* 19
the mullah- hating jews are who you claim they are? %$* 19
i mean, do they really hate the jews when so many iranian jews of the older generation have returned to iran? %$* 19

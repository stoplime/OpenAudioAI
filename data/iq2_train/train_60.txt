i think the market would greet it with great applause, and i'll tell you why. %$* 253
because the market would then gravitate to those with the most efficient delivery of services and all the services these gentlemen speak of rather than just assuming that they can conduct business with them because they're totally safe at all times. %$* 253
only the most efficient would survive. %$* 253
that's what the american capitalist system is all about. %$* 253
if you're not efficient you should fail. %$* 253
if you're efficient you should succeed and grow. %$* 253
so, to me-- %$* 253
that's what we're talking about here. %$* 253
we're talking about taking away the fence of protection, that-- %$* 253
you don’t yet, but your parents as taxpayers, unless you're a very successful young debater-- %$* 253
provide, just taking away all those guarantees and just saying you have to stand up on your own legs just like anybody else to compete efficiently. %$* 253
and, by the way, it may be that xyz bank competes better than everybody else and has that business. %$* 253
that's fine with me, but i do not want to risk another penny of taxpayer money to bail them out when they make a big mistake, and i think that's exactly what will happen, and it will happen in bigger size and it will happen again and it may well, if things go poorly, happen before the waiting period that this gentleman mentioned. %$* 253
doug elliot. %$* 13
yeah, just wanted to say we agree with you on the objective. %$* 255
we don't agree with you that what you're proposing will achieve that objective. %$* 255
i want to go to another question. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
every now and then i have to do this, but i'd love to hear a female voice. %$* 13
and i'm not seeing any female. %$* 13
i see masculine hands. %$* 13
that other guy you could have told like your-- %$* 13
female voice. %$* 18
female hand. %$* 18
thanks. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 19
hi. %$* 19
i'm jen pachichi i work at dpcc i have a question for richard and simon. %$* 19
so you're saying that these banks are all global in nature. %$* 19
and you're proposing to break up the u.s.banks. %$* 19
but how would you handle international banks like barclays who have both commercial, retail, and investment banking divisions? %$* 19
how would they operate in america? %$* 19
richard fisher. %$* 13
one of the arguments you always hear is we have to be big because the others are big. %$* 253
and if not, they will dominate the world. %$* 253
you are a young woman. %$* 253
you probably are too young to remember. %$* 253
that was an argument made that the japanese banks were to dominate the world, nomura, et cetera. %$* 253
or that french banks would dominate the world. %$* 253
it hasn't happened. %$* 253
it doesn't happen because they grow to such a size and scale that they're unmanageable. %$* 253
i don't fear international competition. %$* 253
i want to just be the best at what we do. %$* 253
i want to make sure that our taxpayers are protected so that we don't get driven into the tank like we were before. %$* 253
and i do believe that we can be internationally competitive just by being outstanding. %$* 253
but we've had these fears before. %$* 253
these are protectionist fears. %$* 253
and by the way, they're nonsensical. %$* 253
another question? %$* 13
sir, right in the center there. %$* 13
you thought i called on you before, and i called the guy behind you, but now it's you. %$* 13
if you can stand up when the mic reaches you, thanks. %$* 13
weston onami i think i agree with mr. %$* 18
fisher's proposal. %$* 18
i don't know if the means you choose will achieve that end. %$* 18
i think the two biggest protections are the dodd-frank act and the federal reserve. %$* 18
shouldn't we be talking about breaking up the biggest public bank and their role in subsidizing the large banks that we have? %$* 18
you mean the fed. %$* 13
yes, the fed. %$* 18
what's the question? %$* 18
let's break up the fed. %$* 13
richard elliot. %$* 13
richard, you want me to take that for you? %$* 256
my opponents will give you a very good argument for why we should not break up the fed. %$* 253
down in the front, there was somebody raising his hand before. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
mic's coming to you. %$* 13
if you don't mind also walking up a few steps to get into the camera light. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
i'm mendel lazarus. %$* 18
i'm a senior at yeshiva university, an accounting student, just came to watch the debate. %$* 18
i had a question for richard and simon. %$* 18
and we've mentioned several times the complexities of these large banks, specifically jpmorgan, 4 trillion in assets, 80 trillion in these incredibly risky derivative swaps. %$* 18
in a sense, yeah, you're right, these are incredibly risky things that are so colossal. %$* 18
how would it-- %$* 18
i mean, somebody asked about the economy. %$* 18
but you're suggesting breaking all of this up? %$* 18
who exactly do you think it is that's going to pick up the pieces and make this all function in a smoother way? %$* 18
take first shot? %$* 18
simon johnson. %$* 13
the problem is we’ve put huge subsidies behind these businesses. %$* 254
and particularly with the subsidies of-- %$* 254
behind the derivative book, for example, we are proposing to remove those subsidies. %$* 254
and we believe, because this is what we see around the rest of the american economy, that when you operate without the subsidies, you get efficiency, people who are not very good at running a business go out of business. %$* 254
other people enter and take over. %$* 254
so that's the dynamic of american capitalism. %$* 254
all we want for banking and for the operation of these financial markets is what we have in the rest of the american economy. %$* 254
why should jpmorgan and the people who run it be exempt from the way the rest of the american economy operates? %$* 254
what makes them so special, so different? %$* 254
is it your point that they have become particularly dangerous because of the business they operate? %$* 254
you may be right that they are particularly dangerous. %$* 254
then i think it's even more pressing issue of public policy. %$* 254
sir, can i ask you if you feel that your question was answered in the sense that you were-- %$* 13
i think you were looking for, tell me what this future looks like, what's going to happen. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
richard fisher. %$* 13
a more efficient operator that doesn't need to be subsidized to operate will pick up that business. %$* 253
let me give you an example. %$* 253
there are huge hedge funds that manage derivatives. %$* 253
with each increase in the risk position they take, they have to post greater margin. %$* 253
that does not occur at the xyz banking institution you mentioned before. %$* 253
why should they be different than-- %$* 253
why should they have different rules apply to them that are applied to everybody else in the industry? %$* 253
so, yes, it's a huge derivative book. %$* 253
and, by the way, it's also a question of how the derivatives are balanced in terms of risk. %$* 253
it could be 40-40. %$* 253
they could offset each other or they could have their own capital at risk. %$* 253
when you place your own capital at risk and the number is less than 80 trillion-- %$* 253
i don't know what it is, "x"-- %$* 253
you should be subject to the same rules as anybody else who takes an at risk position. %$* 253
that's all we're advocating. %$* 253
and i'm sure and i know there are others that would take up those positions that were sound and replace the positions that that institution will have, but that's because they're better and more efficient operators and they don't operate with a subsidy. %$* 253
all right. %$* 13
let me bring in paul saltzman. %$* 13
you know, look, it's-- %$* 256
been waiting for the moment to address this fictitious subsidy question, there's no subsidy, okay? %$* 256
oh. %$* 253
there's no-- %$* 256
there's no transference of wealth-- %$* 256
i used love you. %$* 253
i don't love you anymore-- %$* 253
richard, there is no subsidy. %$* 253
there is no empirical evidence to suggest that any taxpayer dollars are currently being transferred for the benefit of big banks. %$* 253
you're throwing out the term "subsidy" and creating this argument as if it's the agricultural industry that gets taxpayer dollars. %$* 253
what you're talking about, just to put it in the context, is allegations or assertions that banks-- %$* 253
somehow large banks borrow at funds cheaper than would otherwise be the case because of market perceptions that they will be bailed out— %$* 253
which seems like a quite reasonable and logical argument. %$* 13
it's just not true. %$* 256
oh. %$* 18
okay? %$* 256
it's just not true, okay. %$* 256
again, going back to your colleagues in the federal reserve system, okay, economists at the federal reserve bank of philadelphia-- %$* 256
there are lots of economists in the federal reserve, by the way. %$* 253
i see, but only yours are right, richard. %$* 256
but only yours are right %$* 256
no, that's not-- %$* 253
a very well respected economist, okay, made it pretty clear, okay, that the growth of the large banks has everything to do with economies of size, scope, and scale, and not the subsidy. %$* 256
secondly, evidence suggests that large institutions borrow at cheaper funds because they're larger, they issue more debt, they have liquidity premiums; more analysts cover them. %$* 256
coca-cola borrows more cheaply than rc cola. %$* 256
would you suggest breaking up coca-cola or calling that a subsidy? %$* 256
the fact of the matter is the deposit liability structure of banks is very complex and it's impossible to assess how and when cost of funds differentials are attributable to the too big to fail issue that you're-- %$* 256
simon johnson. %$* 13
simply not true. %$* 254
simon johnson. %$* 13
you just summarized very nicely all the industry papers, the papers written by people who work for the big banks on this topic. %$* 254
if we look at the independent research, including a workshop at nyu that you helped to organize last week, as you know there were two very good-- %$* 254
let me may i finish john? %$* 254
yes, you may. %$* 13
but it's just not true. %$* 256
well, let him finish his point and then you can tell him %$* 13
there were two very good papers by independent academics and groups of academics at that workshop just last week that showed there are substantial subsidies of the too big to fail kind that exactly we've been talking about. %$* 254
that was your own conference call. %$* 254
why are you ignoring that evidence? %$* 254
why are you-- %$* 256
paul saltzman. %$* 13
ignoring randy kroszner’s paper, former governor of the federal reserve-- %$* 256
randy kroszner's paper-- %$* 254
why are you ignoring loretta mester’s paper-- %$* 256
randy kroszner's-- %$* 254
why are you ignoring all the papers that are against you? %$* 256
that's what you do, simon. %$* 256
randy kroszner simply-- %$* 254
you ignore everything that's against you and you-- %$* 256
by the way, everybody got the package of the papers. %$* 13
i want you to make your own judgments on this. %$* 13
randy kroszner's paper was paid for by-- %$* 254
wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. %$* 13
dueling papers does not help us. %$* 13
and i realize that it's a serious point. %$* 13
i'm not making light of the fact, but it doesn't help us get anywhere because we can't evaluate them. %$* 13
so i-- %$* 13
i hope, doug, you're not going to talk about a paper. %$* 13
just one very straightforward thing. %$* 255
yeah. %$* 13
the papers you're talking about ended-- %$* 255
no, but it is straightforward-- %$* 255
the papers ended in 2010.that's three years ago. %$* 255
a lot has changed. %$* 255
okay. %$* 13
let's go to-- %$* 13
thought that was pretty robust. %$* 13
maybe i should have let it go. %$* 13
sir, right down front. %$* 13
seeing-- %$* 13
yes, there are fewer hands going up now. %$* 13
questions have been great tonight, by the way. %$* 13
my name is joe webber i'm a-- %$* 18
this question is a bit different i think than most of the others. %$* 18
i'm a veteran of the telecommunications wars of the 1980s when the government decided that at&t was too big, effectively-- %$* 18
it was the world's largest corporation-- %$* 18
and broke it up into eight pieces. %$* 18
well, now, some years later-- %$* 18
and that was not without cost or disruption either, it was a pretty complex operation to divest those companies-- %$* 18
and now here we are, 30 years, 25 years later, and we have two absolutely enormous companies, both of them bigger than at&t was - - %$* 18
so-- %$* 13
back in 1984. %$* 18
so can you frame this as a question? %$* 13
i'm sorry? %$* 18
can you frame your question as a question? %$* 13
oh, yeah, yeah, sure. %$* 18
so the question here is maybe we should take a lesson from that. %$* 18
and to my friends on my left, how are you going to make sure that the broken up pieces of all of these companies which are going to break up are not going to grow so large as to become threats to, you know, too big to fail again? %$* 18
are we going to play whack-a-mole with these people forever? %$* 18
richard, that's a question richard fisher. %$* 13
for the first time i'm pleased to be called "somebody on the left." i have no problem with growth. %$* 253
i have no problem with size, per se. %$* 253
what i have a problem with is when it's subsidized by the american taxpayer. %$* 253
if at&t were to fail today or if verizon were to fail today we wouldn't bail them out with taxpayer money. %$* 253
we'd let them go. %$* 253
we'd say, "to hell with them." that's not what we do with too big to fail banks. %$* 253
in fact we have enshrined through dodd-frank in my opinion this infinite, constant, permanent subsidization of the protection using taxpayer money. %$* 253
i don't care what the law says. %$* 253
i'm telling you how it works. %$* 253
and the way it works, and the way it has worked, and we've seen an example of it, so we had an implicit assumption they would be bailed out, and then we had an explicit confirmation they would be bailed out by the american taxpayer. %$* 253
all i want-- %$* 253
richard-- %$* 13
all i want is to make sure that, that never happens again. %$* 253
richard, you're-- %$* 13
and if someone can grow based on their efficiency, i'm all for them. %$* 253
but i will not protect them by putting your money at risk. %$* 253
i'm not sure that you addressed this question. %$* 13
you may have, but you were returning to points that you made several times. %$* 13
and i think his question was, you know, you break up these or shrink these banks, what's to keep them from finding each other again and becoming big again? %$* 13
and he seemed to think that that was a concern. %$* 13
and it seems-- %$* 13
it's an interesting question, but i didn't think that i heard an answer to it. %$* 13
again, i want a level playing field. %$* 253
i want small banks to become big banks if they have the talent to do so and they do so without taking risks that will then come back to bite the american taxpayer on their-- %$* 253
okay. %$* 18
neck. %$* 253
oh, let me let the other side respond, sir, and then-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 18
paul saltzman. %$* 13
maybe this is a concession, maybe not, i will support legislation that ends subsidies. %$* 256
we have it already. %$* 256
i'm not exactly quite sure what you're looking for, richard. %$* 256
the fact of the matter is the law prohibits taxpayer bailouts. %$* 256
no one wants a subsidy. %$* 256
no one wants firms to be artificially fueled by unfair advantage. %$* 256
we're in agreement as to the goal. %$* 256
the gentleman raised an excellent point. %$* 256
the fact of the matter is most companies with large fixed expenses like banks grow large for a reason. %$* 256
they can only be profitable because what they do requires size, scope, and scale. %$* 256
well, i'm glad to hear you support my proposition. %$* 253
goal. %$* 256
my name is fred deutsch to the side opposed, if your position is that the scale and scope of jpmorgan allows it to be the most efficient compared to the smaller banks, why is it that jpmorgan is not the low cost mortgage provider in new york and can't execute international trade as efficiently as the smaller banks with whom we do business? %$* 18
doug elliott. %$* 13
sure. %$* 255
first of all, here you're talking about one specific example. %$* 255
every bank's going to have strengths and weaknesses. %$* 255
i don't think that the big strength of the banks we're talking about is their retail business, and it wouldn't surprise me if there are times when they don't have the great advantage there. %$* 255
where i see the more compelling case is where you're talking about doing things that smaller banks just really can't do, period. %$* 255
the international trade, i'm not sure i could answer that. %$* 255
i'm sure there are people who would argue they do a nice job. %$* 255
i don't know enough about it. %$* 255
so they're really good at managing big, complex derivative transactions in london. %$* 254
i think that was the answer. %$* 254
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is "break up the big banks." so here's where we are. %$* 13
we are about to move on to round three, round three, are brief closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted before the debate. %$* 13
immediately after these closing statements you'll be asked to vote again. %$* 13
it's-- %$* 13
this is their last chance to change your minds before the second vote on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is this, "break up the big banks." and here to summarize his position against this motion, paul saltzman, president of the clearinghouse association. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, paul saltzman. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 256
and i'm going off script a little bit to basically say there's an awful lot we do agree with. %$* 256
there's an awful lot of the objectives that we do agree with. %$* 256
we just have different ways of getting there, but i know you've heard a lot of facts and figures and contradictory assertions, but let me ask you to just consider three simple practical facts. %$* 256
i ask you to remember that america needs global banks, and it reflects the global economy in which we live. %$* 256
unlike any era before, we live in a global economy. %$* 256
it's clear that our economy requires these international banks to support customers. %$* 256
the only question is whether america will sit on the sidelines or be part of that. %$* 256
today, just four of the world's largest 25 banks are american banks. %$* 256
to break them up and reduce that number to zero jeopardizes america's leadership in the world and america's global leadership. %$* 256
we need solutions that move the financial system forward, not backward. %$* 256
i ask that you keep in mind that we can't roll back the clock. %$* 256
i know it's natural after the kind of disaster that we faced and the turmoil that we've all experienced to yearn for simpler, less complex times, but the american economy that was once served exclusively by small banks just no longer exists. %$* 256
the good old days weren't that good. %$* 256
the s&l crisis, the great depression, all were caused by systemic risks associated with smaller banks. %$* 256
rolling back the clock to restructure the banking system isn't realistic, and it simply wouldn't make us safer. %$* 256
i ask you to support dodd-frank, the macro-prudential reforms that are making it less likely for banks to fail. %$* 256
in closing, i know it feels good, but i submit that breaking up the big banks would create a host of new problems and solve almost none. %$* 256
we can do better and we should. %$* 256
please vote no and oppose the proposition. %$* 256
thank you. %$* 256
thank you, paul saltzman. %$* 13
our motion is "break up the big banks," and here to speak in summary in support of this motion, richard fisher, president of the federal reserve bank of dallas. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, richard fisher. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 253
i would submit that america needs competition. %$* 253
i would submit that america needs a level playing field. %$* 253
i would submit that america never again wants to expose its taxpayers to bailing out institutions that made bad decisions, because they were badly managed and they were encouraged basically to achieve a size and scale under the protection of the law. %$* 253
i therefore strongly endorse taking action that would cordon off the guarantees we provide to these mega financial institutions and just make them subject to the same competitive rules that affect all other businesses. %$* 253
i ask you to support our motion to break up the too big to fail banks. %$* 253
thank you. %$* 253
thank you, richard fisher. %$* 13
and that is our motion: "break up the big banks," and here to speak against the motion in his closing statement, doug elliott, a fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, doug elliott. %$* 13
thank you, john, and thank you everyone for the opportunity. %$* 255
this is an important question. %$* 255
let me repeat what paul said. %$* 255
the overall objectives you've described, richard, and i think simon, we would agree with. %$* 255
i focus on two points why i don't agree with your actual proposal. %$* 255
first is i'm still a little unclear exactly what it is and how it relates to the actual thing we were supposed to debate, and for me that's an important point, but beyond that-- %$* 255
beyond that, i do believe that from the years of experience i had working in the industry that the customers really have seen major advantages. %$* 255
a lot of the growth has been customer driven, and i do want to say, richard, early on you were describing bankers who were deliberately creating excessively large firms for the sake of being excessively large, opaque firms for the sake of maximizing the subsidies. %$* 255
i worked in m&a in finance working with financial institutions. %$* 255
i never once in the 20 years ever talked to anybody who, even in private conversations, had any of those things as their objectives. %$* 255
now i can understand if you want to make the argument that the incentive structure pushes things that way, but i would strongly urge backing away from language that both of you at times have used that argues that the bankers are deliberately trying to create their firms in such a way that they get these subsidies. %$* 255
i think i'll leave it there. %$* 255
i'd urge you to vote against the motion. %$* 255
thank you very much, doug elliott. %$* 13
and that is our motion: "break up the big banks." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion to break up the big banks, simon johnson, former chief economist at the imf, professor at mit sloan school of management. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, simon johnson. %$* 13
in 1902, the administration of teddy roosevelt brought an antitrust action against northern securities. %$* 254
a very large railroad company in the northwest part of the united states. %$* 254
it was one of the first actions of its kind. %$* 254
it was extremely controversial. %$* 254
a lot of people in the mainstream didn't know what roosevelt was doing. %$* 254
there were plenty of arguments made that these monopolies were modern, they were efficient. %$* 254
they would benefit the american economy. %$* 254
j.p.morgan, the original j.p.morgan, the man, came to the white house in february 1902.and he said to roosevelt and to his attorney general, "if we've done anything wrong, send your man to see my man, and we'll fix it up." and roosevelt and his attorney general, thank goodness, said no. %$* 254
we don't want to fix it up. %$* 254
we want to stop it. %$* 254
this, in roosevelt's mind, was an excessive concentration of power. %$* 254
it was dangerous to the democracy. %$* 254
they took that case all the way to the supreme court. %$* 254
they won it 4 to 3.and out of that came a lot more precedents, antitrust cases, more legislation and, i would submit, the really important change was a shift in the consensus, people like you in new york in 1902 didn't know what roosevelt was doing or why it made sense. %$* 254
they thought, many of them, it'd be bad for business. %$* 254
in 1911, when the government moved to break up standard oil, there were very few defenders of huge monopolies. %$* 254
people understood concentrated power can be very damaging in this democracy. %$* 254
vote for the democracy. %$* 254
vote to break up the big banks. %$* 254
thank you. %$* 254
thank you, simon johnson. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side do you feel has argued best. %$* 13
we're asking you again to go to the key pads at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
we're going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously. %$* 13
press number one if you are for the motion, press number two if you are against the motion, and press number three if remain or became undecided. %$* 13
and again, we're going to lock that out in a second, and then we are about two minutes away from having the results. %$* 13
a few things i want to take care of. %$* 13
first of all, some news headlines, as we've been debating, the senate has passed a measure to end the shutdown and to raise the debt limit. %$* 13
president obama began speaking on television five minutes ago, but nobody leaves. %$* 13
and the house is expected to follow suit tonight. %$* 13
i also want to say this about this debate. %$* 13
it was really terrific. %$* 13
these debaters obviously feel passionate about this. %$* 13
they have a shared common ground, but they have very, very honest disagreements that were honestly argued. %$* 13
and i want to congratulate for the way they did this tonight. %$* 13
i also again want to thank the richard paul richman center for business law and public policy for being our partner in this. %$* 13
we love having them onboard, and they've been extremely helpful. %$* 13
so thank you to them as well. %$* 13
and the last thing i want to say is, sometimes i said at the beginning, the questions can be pretty dodgy. %$* 13
but tonight's questions were terrific. %$* 13
and i want to congratulate every-- %$* 13
we didn't throw one out. %$* 13
everybody got in. %$* 13
and i want to congratulate everybody who has the guts to get up and do it because it's a scary thing to do. %$* 13
so thank you for that. %$* 13

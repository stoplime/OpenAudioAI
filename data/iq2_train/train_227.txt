good evening. %$* 589
i'd like to encourage people to come in and fill in the seats, even up in the front. %$* 589
uh there's not going to be a collection or an altar call so it's ok.i am peter steinfels. %$* 589
and as moderator of this debate on whether america is too damn religious, i’ve been asked to offer the opening prayer. %$* 589
it's very simple. %$* 589
we pray that all cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, blueberries, strawberries, personal video games or anything else that beeps, squeaks or plays the william tell overture or otherwise announced itself, be turned off for the duration of the evening. %$* 589
and if some people should fail to do this, may heaven open and turn them into pillars of salt, amen. %$* 589
we look forward to an exciting, stimulating and enjoyable exchange of ideas. %$* 589
tonight's debate like its predecessors is being taped for radio broadcast. %$* 589
with each of these debates, this taping has grown more expert and refined. %$* 589
and there are now, i am told, microphones everywhere, hanging from the rafters, on the sides of the stage, probably in your lapels. %$* 589
and one result of this extraordinary taping is that certain sounds are magnified and distorted. %$* 589
i'm also told that unwrapping candy or otherwise wrinkling cellophane sounds like fire breaking out in the auditorium. %$* 589
so if you anticipate an irrepressible need for a snickers bar or a fresh packet of kleenex to dab your eyes in response to our speakers' eloquence, please unwrap it right now. %$* 589
a further word about response this evening. %$* 589
naturally we will all give our outstanding debaters a respectful hearing. %$* 589
no jeers, cat calls, throwing cabbages and so on. %$* 589
but applause is very welcome. %$* 589
and the sound engineers can pick up all its gradations from tepid to exuberant. %$* 589
especially if they have something of a sound check. %$* 589
and so if you don't mind, i'd like to ask you right now, could you give us a round of say polite applause? %$* 589
thank you very much, that was very polite. %$* 589
perhaps bordering on the apathetic, but. %$* 589
now can we have an example of enthusiastic support. %$* 589
i know i'd better not ask you for mindless frenzy. %$* 589
as the debaters make their opening statements this evening, you may be readying your own brief questions for the question and answer portion to follow. %$* 589
if you want three by five cards to write down your questions and that usually helps those of us who are shy and those of us who need some discipline, once we overcome that shyness, lest we be long winded, uh the ushers will provide you with such a card. %$* 589
and it is now my pleasure to introduce the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, the sponsor of this evening's event, please welcome robert rosenkranz. %$* 589
well thank you that was polite. %$* 1
i'm here with dana wolfe, the executive producer of this debate series. %$* 1
and it's my pleasure to welcome you. %$* 1
this is our first debate of our spring season, but you wouldn't know it was spring by being outside. %$* 1
we're thrilled that wnyc is recording this series of debates and that through national public radio you'll be able to hear this debate on public radio stations around the country. %$* 1
we also value the sponsorship of the times of london. %$* 1
and i want to especially thank our moderator, peter steinfels, who i'll formally introduce in a moment and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the real stars of tonight's event. %$* 1
you know, i was looking at some opinion polls taken abroad in preparation for my remarks tonight and i find that sixty percent of respondents in france and holland think that america is too religious. %$* 1
and people who think that also tend to be pretty anti-american. %$* 1
in pakistan, sixty percent of people are anti-american and they consider that we're not religious enough. %$* 1
they're offended by the secular nature of our culture. %$* 1
uh and um so, maybe we can't win or maybe we've got it just right. %$* 1
what has been called our civil religion has a sacred history in america. %$* 1
words from the declaration of independence—we hold these truths to be self evident. %$* 1
that we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. %$* 1
the gettysburg address, four score and seven, invokes the cadences of the bible. %$* 1
our thanksgiving, our major national holiday, thanks providence for america and invites us to meditate on our meaning. %$* 1
the fourth of july celebrates liberty, memorial day – sacrifice. %$* 1
the moral imperatives of religion lead to an outpouring of support for victims of genocide in rwanda. %$* 1
for victims of aids in africa. %$* 1
for victims of national disasters anywhere on the planet. %$* 1
for a large and increasing number of americans, evangelical or pentecostal churches give them what they need to live more responsible, more energetic, more meaningful lives. %$* 1
but as mahatma ghandi said, “those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics, do not know what religion is.” and our politics seem to have a great deal to do with religion these days. %$* 1
controversies persist over gay marriage, stem cell research. %$* 1
the under god language of the pledge of allegiance. %$* 1
vouchers for parochial school students. %$* 1
the fitness for a mormon to run for president of the united states. %$* 1
are these normal issues in the usual force of political discourse? %$* 1
or are they evidence that america is indeed too damn religious? %$* 1
well let's see what our esteemed panelists have to say and which side of the motion will carry the day. %$* 1
our moderator this evening is peter steinfels. %$* 1
professor at fordham university. %$* 1
co-director of their center on religion and culture, and a religion columnist for the new york times. %$* 1
peter created and continues to write his bi- weekly column, beliefs, dealing with religion and ethics in the times. %$* 1
he's written numerous books on religion, including a people adrift: the crisis of the roman catholic church in america. %$* 1
it's now my pleasure to hand the evening over to peter. %$* 1
thank you very much bob for your introduction. %$* 589
i would now also welcome you to the fifth intelligence squared us debate. %$* 589
and i'd like to try and give you a brief rundown of the evening. %$* 589
first, the proponents of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument. %$* 589
the opposition will follow. %$* 589
each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other. %$* 589
second, when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks, i will open up the floor to some brief questions from the audience and perhaps toss in a few of my own. %$* 589
third when the q and a is complete, each debater will have the opportunity to make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes per person. %$* 589
fourth, during the closing statements ballot boxes will be passed around for voting. %$* 589
this is the ticket. %$* 589
whoops. %$* 589
this is the ballot box which has come suspiciously open in my picking it up. %$* 589
you will uh be asked to put in either the for piece, the against piece or the whole ticket if you still not – if you still haven't made up your mind as to which side you favor. %$* 589
if anyone does not have a ticket ballot, an usher will get you one at the appropriate time. %$* 589
fifth and last, after the final closing statement is made, i will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day. %$* 589
let me now introduce the panel which i'm very proud to do. %$* 589
for the motion, author and program director of the think tank, the center for inquiry, susan jacoby. %$* 589
executive director of americans united for separation of church and state, attorney and ordained minister, barry w.lynn. %$* 589
and author, professor of political science and director of the boisi center for religion and american public life at boston college, alan wolfe. %$* 589
against the motion, the laura spelman rockefeller professor of social and political ethics at the university of chicago, political philosopher jean bethke elshtain. %$* 589
senior fellow in the brookings institution's governance studies program and college park professor at the university of maryland, william a.galston. %$* 589
and the henry w.putnam professor in religion at princeton university, religious historian albert j.raboteau. %$* 589
and i think all of you know that there are even more extended biographies of our panelists this evening in the programs. %$* 589
so we will begin. %$* 589
like to start out with a speaker for, to take the podium, for tonight's motion. %$* 589
uh barry lynn. %$* 589
thank you very much. %$* 590
uh so now that you know that i'm both a minister and a lawyer, you know that i'm capable of forgiving you but going on to sue you anyway. %$* 590
um now what is it, why is it that a church going, jesus-accepting member of the christian clergy is on this side of the platform tonight? %$* 590
and the answer really lies in the very carefully worded proposition that is under debate this evening. %$* 590
that america is too damn religious. %$* 590
i don't think there is too much religion in america. %$* 590
although my own colleagues actually might disagree with that. %$* 590
but i clearly think there's too much of the damnable kind. %$* 590
what is a damned religion? %$* 590
damned religion is a religion so weak willed and unsure of its own capacity to persuade others to support it or live by its guidance that it seeks the blessing of government. %$* 590
that it seeks financial aid from government. %$* 590
and that it even tries to convert its theological beliefs into legislative fiats. %$* 590
this damned form of religion is a corruption both of faith and of constitutional democracy. %$* 590
and it makes a mockery of the best in our history. %$* 590
it was the fifth united states congress that unanimously approved the treaty of tripoli which unequivocally stated that this was in no way founded as a christian nation. %$* 590
thomas jefferson refused to sign proclamations of prayer or resolutions of thanksgiving, believing how shocking is this, that it should be religious bodies, not governmental ones that decided what days should bring forth the greatest prayer from the american people. %$* 590
and james madison even objected to the 1790 census form because it had a question merely asking you if you were a member of the clergy. %$* 590
indeed, throughout most of our american history we've been moving toward a greater embrace of religious diversity. %$* 590
a greater rejection of the idea that government, federal or state should pick favorites among religions or choose religion over non-religion. %$* 590
by 1960 then presidential aspirant john f.kennedy addressed a meeting of southern baptists concerned about his allegiances as a roman catholic, to declare, “i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute.” but what a difference a few decades can make. %$* 590
now politicians see as much advantage in pandering to religion as the embarrassingly religion seems to gain or try to gain by seeking the assistance of government. %$* 590
so it's a dual corruption, tainting the secular nature of our government and making religious groups special interest supplicants at what is often a quite odoriferous public trough. %$* 590
so let me just briefly go into these uh specifics in these minutes remaining, of how this unholy matrimony kind of plays out in the 21st century. %$* 590
first, religious groups too often, if you will, seek the blessing of government. %$* 590
a few examples. %$* 590
as if the nation were somehow absent private property, now we see public spaces increasingly festooned with more and more religious icons and images, monuments and scriptural citations. %$* 590
almost always at the behest of the currently statistically most popular religion in america, christianity. %$* 590
now i concede that a lot of americans like it that way. %$* 590
in a december poll for example, seventy eight percent of the respondents said they wanted to continue to see nativity scenes outside their local government offices. %$* 590
but curiously in the same poll only fifty three percent said they were actually planning to attend a worship service at christmas. %$* 590
is it really good for religion when its adherents in larger numbers would like to catch a quick glimpse of jesus in a manger, possibly surrounded by a few reindeer and candy canes, rather than actually spend an hour sitting for a religious ceremony. %$* 590
it can't be. %$* 590
or how about the reasoning used in a constitutional challenge to ohio's official motto – “with god all things are possible.” the federal appeals court upheld the continued use of the seal, claiming that the phrase had essentially lost its religious significance. %$* 590
there was widespread applause from the religious right. %$* 590
but again to me how can you be happy as a spiritual person when a court notes that the statement that god is both alive and omnipotent is seen as theologically meaningless form overuse. %$* 590
i should note sometimes occasionally legislators also go beyond this. %$* 590
they confuse religion with magic. %$* 590
after every major uh school shooting in the united states, members of congress insist that if we posted the ten commandments on every school room wall we would stop the next violent student uprising from occurring. %$* 590
they're never willing to talk about gun control. %$* 590
they're never willing to even talk about spending money to work with at risk young people but the decalogue display is the panacea. %$* 590
but you know if proximity to holy words really made us better people then the presence of gideon bibles in nightstands at motels would have ended adultery long ago and its has not. %$* 590
it is not that simple. %$* 590
now second, dissatisfied with some powerful symbolic support, some groups even go further and actually want to receive from the public treasury the tax dollars of all of this. %$* 590
funding. %$* 590
president bush likes this idea. %$* 590
he created an office of faith based initiatives back in 2001 to get more money for what he called the armies of compassion around america who cared for the poor, the hungry and the homeless. %$* 590
what he forgot to tell us is that government had been partnering with many religious organizations for many decades in this county with just two little caveats. %$* 590
first, any program that got federal money had to forget evangelizing in that program. %$* 590
so that if money went to counseling people suffering from addiction, you had to stick to medical and psychological counseling with those federal dollars and leave the idea of getting right with god to some other separately funded program. %$* 590
second, it was presumed that you only got tax dollars to provide secular services and that you had to therefore hire the most qualified person for the job regardless of any preference you might wish to give on the basis of religious belief or affiliation. %$* 590
but for the president those caveats were just technicalities. %$* 590
he told an audience in new orleans just one year before he forgot that the city existed that he saw his program as one that would give funds to groups that are saving americans one soul at a time. %$* 590
once again confusing his role as commander in chief of that of theologian in chief. %$* 590
he claimed that hiring by faith groups could be done without regard to civil rights laws against discrimination and i find that such an absurd commentary for the early twenty first century. %$* 590
does anyone think that baptists or buddhists or atheists or adventists actually ladle the food in a soup kitchen differently? %$* 590
does it make any difference to you as a person living in a homeless shelter %$* 590
whether that – uh adventist has tucked in your bed sheet or an atheist has done it. %$* 590
final characteristic of damned religion is the most pernicious. %$* 590
that's where religious groups decide that because they are sure that they have a biblical understanding of an issue, say the right of reproductive choice, no one will be dared to have another opinion and act on it. %$* 590
that's why they seek things like constitutional amendments to prohibit all abortion. %$* 590
i know that there are people on the other side of this debate who will say that there is great evidence of progressive thinking in churches now and in the past and obviously that's true. %$* 590
but i remind you that dr. %$* 590
martin luther king never created a hundred million dollar dialing for dollars ministry on television. %$* 590
he never endorsed a single candidate from any pulpit in america. %$* 590
he knew that the long arc of justice would reach its goal only when all americans, black and white, young and old, believer and non-believer, would count on the constitution as the last great protector of the rights of the people. %$* 590
that's the faith that ought to guide religion in america but regrettably it's the damned kind that seems to get all the attention and have all the clout today. %$* 590
and luckily because i am not running for any elective %$* 590
office, i do not have to say at the end of this small speech, god bless america. %$* 590
one minute warning. %$* 589
whether that – uh adventist has tucked in your bed sheet or an atheist has done it. %$* 590
final characteristic of damned religion is the most pernicious. %$* 590
that's where religious groups decide that because they are sure that they have a biblical understanding of an issue, say the right of reproductive choice, no one will be dared to have another opinion and act on it. %$* 590
that's why they seek things like constitutional amendments to prohibit all abortion. %$* 590

that's the faith that ought to guide religion in america but regrettably it's the damned kind that seems to get all the attention and have all the clout today. %$* 590
and luckily because i am not running for any elective %$* 590
if you'll wrap it up %$* 589
office, i do not have to say at the end of this small speech, god bless america. %$* 590
thank you very much barry lynn. %$* 589
and now the first speaker against the motion, jean bethke elshtain. %$* 589
america is too damn religious. %$* 591
says who? %$* 591
we could ask our greatest presidential theologian abraham lincoln, who references god fourteen times in the four paragraphs of his masterpiece of american political rhetoric, the second inaugural address. %$* 591
we could ask martin luther king with the rhythms of cadences and words of scripture flowing eloquently in his powerful civic sermons. %$* 591
as you listen to that remarkable voice, intoning the words of the prophet amos, let justice roll down like a mighty river. %$* 591
close your eyes and utter amen brother, amen. %$* 591
king certainly worked to bring theological beliefs into political imperatives. %$* 591
indeed we could ask the african american community and my distinguished colleague, professor roboteau will say more, are you too damn religious? %$* 591
for that community has a long history of bringing religion into civic life. %$* 591
or, you could consult dorothy day of this city. %$* 591
it was awfully damned religious of her to organize tax revolts and protest marches against all manner of injustice as she understood the public implications of her faith. %$* 591
or monsignor john ryan, father new deal as he was called. %$* 591
and adviser to fdr who brought catholic social teaching to questions of economic justice. %$* 591
and how about that fdr? %$* 591
goes on the radio and offers a prayer on d day, broadcast to all of america, to the world and to our soldiers on both fronts. %$* 591
presumably we are not to have any more of that thing, kind of thing. %$* 591
we could ask pro life citizens today, many of whom are called by their faith to oppose abortion and to challenge what they take to be the abuse of state authority to sanction through law, a harrowing practice. %$* 591
i'm assuming most in this room don't agree with their position, but in their protest, i would remind you that they remind us of what free speech and free exercise of religion is all about. %$* 591
do we really want to put ourselves in the position of authorizing busybodies to say to our preachers and politicians and citizens at every turn you've crossed the line? %$* 591
you're now too damned religious. %$* 591
you're bringing your faith in everywhere and now keeping it safely contained. %$* 591
tusk tusk. %$* 591
now we will be likely to hear certain things from our opponents. %$* 591
we may be treated to a rogue's gallery, a line up of religious suspects. %$* 591
guilty as charged. %$* 591
fanatics out to steal our liberties and endanger the republic thereby. %$* 591
as i read these sorts of accounts i'm stunned that america has survived. %$* 591
we will be told that it is only the hyper vigilance of those determined to snuff out too damn much religion that has spared us. %$* 591
but the view that we are too damned religious does not pass critical muster. %$* 591
i'm a professor and tempted to be professorial by citing distinguished scholars on church and state, who point out that it is the vigilance of religious citizens to over-extension of state power determined to quash the too damned religious that has over the years, protected the freedoms of us all. %$* 591
free exercise. %$* 591
freedom of speech. %$* 591
freedom of assembly. %$* 591
they haven't done this alone of course but please, i beg you, at this late date don't engage in the shallow exercise of pitting the non-religious who support civil liberties against those with religious commitments who allegedly do not. %$* 591
it flies in the face of the facts. %$* 591
and while we're at it, let's not traffic in the tedious pitting of faith against reason that we hear so frequently. %$* 591
in the long history of christianity as you heard from from reverend lynn, america's dominant faith tradition, the great theologians for centuries explored the entanglement of faith and reason. %$* 591
in my class yesterday at the university of chicago we discussed thomas aquinas with his relentless emphasis on human reason and his definition of human beings as rational, mortal creatures. %$* 591
of course you will find some who downgraded reason in the overall scheme of things. %$* 591
but you would be hard pressed to find a great theologian who understood faith as nothing but a leap into irrationality. %$* 591
rather, the challenge was to ask how faith and reason worked together. %$* 591
how we could bring faith and reason to issues of our time. %$* 591
rather than to assume that they were polar opposites. %$* 591
as to criminal activity, whether committed by the religious or non- religious, ladies and gentlemen we have remedies in law. %$* 591
we are not helpless when confronted by fanatics who commit crimes from whichever direction they come. %$* 591
the problem is that to our opponents, the fanatics tend to come from one direction only. %$* 591
are we to compare terrible persons and happenings? %$* 591
i dare say that in the twentieth century the anti-religious who thought all religion was damned religion would win hands down. %$* 591
who can forget that electric moment at the trial of the nazi war criminal, adolph eichmann, when he refused to take an oath on the bible. %$* 591
he was part of the nazi inner circle. %$* 591
he would not touch his hand to this book. %$* 591
the story of those despised israelites and the christians who effeminized people as the nazis put it all the time, by trying to keep the strong from destroying the weak which is precisely what they were all about. %$* 591
now in the history of our republic, confessional pluralism and social and political pluralism go hand in hand. %$* 591
if you think we're too damn religious, you're likely to think we're too damn pluralistic. %$* 591
one of the glories of this country has turned into a liability and a danger thereby. %$* 591
the great french observer of the american democracy, alexis detocqueville, noticed something new under the political sun when he toured these united states. %$* 591
he took account of the way that religious conviction and associational energy and enthusiasm went hand in hand, helping to create a unique, robust, civil society. %$* 591
true then, 1830 – true now one - %$* 591
as my distinguished colleague, professor galston will point out. %$* 591
ladies and gentlemen, this is new york city. %$* 591
i know you are a tough crowd. %$* 591
i would ask you to listen to the voice of reason from our side. %$* 591
that understands that one should not, from any direction, separate america's citizens who accept a secular world from those, the religious, who allegedly do not. %$* 591
citizens of religious commitment are among the most enthusiastic supporters of a secular government. %$* 591
they don't want established religion but they also understand that to support a secular government and state does not commit us to a thoroughly secularized society, shorn of religious voices, symbols, activities and commitments. %$* 591
we would be a greatly impoverished country were this to come to pass. %$* 591
so too damn religious? %$* 591
nope. %$* 591
just pretty damn american. %$* 591
thank you very much jean elshtain. %$* 589
and now speaking for tonight's motion, alan wolfe. %$* 589
this doesn't if the proposition before us tonight was the proposition are americans too damned religious, i would answer no. %$* 592
in fact i'd be on that side of the table. %$* 592
um americans it seems to me, could very well be much more religious than they actually are. %$* 592
if americans were more religious, i believe, we would have much more social justice in this country. %$* 592
we would have much more of an active welfare state in this country. %$* 592
one of the reasons why european societies have their welfare states, with such extensive social provisions for children and for the elderly and for the helpless, is because they've had christian democratic parties that have relied on christian social teachings to create a society much more caring than our own. %$* 592
if americans were much more religious there would have been much more pretest against the revelations of torture at abu ghraib and other aspects of our foreign policy. %$* 592
for someone to be tortured and hung up like he was being crucifixed would be so unacceptable if americans were more religious that there would have been massive protests. %$* 592
not only against the tactics, the illegal torture tactics used by the bush administration but by the whole war in iraq would have, which would have violated the social teachings of the single most, largest christian denomination in the united states, the catholic church. %$* 592
if americans were more religious they would listen more to the pope and his opposition to the war. %$* 592
if americans were more religious however, if americans were more religious, america would be much less religious. %$* 592
our proposition is whether america is too religious and on that question i'm on this side of the fence. %$* 592
because there's a difference between americans as individuals and america as a public space and a public society. %$* 592
now i want to offer i want to offer this proposition as the basis of my remarks. %$* 592
if americans were more damned religious as opposed to america, the single greatest benefit would be that george w.bush would never have been elected president of the united states. %$* 592
why do i say that? %$* 592
because i believe that the face of the republican party, sometimes called the christian right is much more a political movement than it is a religious movement. %$* 592
and that it has violated the spirit of what it means to be religious in american life and in particular it’s violated the spirit of its own religious tradition. %$* 592
i'm fascinated by one historical figure who i believe to be the single most important american never to have had a full length biography written of him. %$* 592
his name was john leland. %$* 592
he was a baptist minister and itinerant preacher in the early 19th century. %$* 592
uh he wrote in his memoirs, he said i’ve preached in four hundred and thirty six meeting houses, thirty seven courthouses, several capitals, many academies and school house. %$* 592
barns, tobacco houses, dwelling houses and so on. %$* 592
he estimated that he converted sixteen hundred people to jesus christ and he praised jesus christ as his savior. %$* 592
we owe to john leland, the first amendment to the united states constitution. %$* 592
it was john leland who engaged in a bargain with james madison in virginia that leland would support madison as a delegate to the convention that ratified the us constitution if madison would drop his previous opposition to a bill of rights and support one. %$* 592
james leland uh john leland was a baptist. %$* 592
the baptists in america under the guise and leadership of people like roger williams had been uh uh very, very passionate and devoted advocates of religious liberty in the united states. %$* 592
all that changed in the 1980s. %$* 592
it changed in the 1980s when john leland's heirs, the southern baptist convention, dropped its long history of commitment to religious liberty to move in a more theocratic direction for explicitly political reasons. %$* 592
i'm sure that almost no one in this room knows that in 1973 when the united states supreme court handed down its decision in roe v wade, the decision that presumably started the american culture war, the southern baptist convention was fully in support of roe v wade. %$* 592
baptists distrusted the state. %$* 592
they distrusted state intervention. %$* 592
if a state could tell a woman what she could do with her body, it could tell a believer what he or she could do with his or her mind. %$* 592
by 1980s the southern baptist convention had completely changed its position. %$* 592
repudiated its earlier support and become the major force besides the catholic church in america, to overturn roe v wade. %$* 592
now i submit that between 1973 and 1983, god did not change his mind on the question of abortion. %$* 592
but baptists did. %$* 592
why did they change their mind? %$* 592
they changed their minds in part because they believed that america had become too decadent a society. %$* 592
but they also changed their minds because they saw an opportunity. %$* 592
the reagan presidency. %$* 592
the opportunity to exercise political power in america. %$* 592
and they opted for political power and it was the direct result of this change in the southern baptist convention. %$* 592
our largest protestant denomination that created the southern republican party and that eventually resulted in the election of george w.bush with the enthusiastic support of people associated with the southern baptist convention. %$* 592
in a democratic society, all the more power to them. %$* 592
they don't like roe v wade, all the more power to them. %$* 592
organize politically. %$* 592
elect your candidates, change the law. %$* 592
get new people on the supreme court. %$* 592
i am second to none in my admiration for their political success. %$* 592
i don't agree with them, i'm on the other side. %$* 592
but you, i cannot take away the brilliance of their political tactics or the brilliance of the bush administration in using and relying on that base. %$* 592
but to think that this has anything whatsoever to do with matters of the spirit, matters of the heart or matters of one's relationship to a supreme being strikes me as far too great a stretch. %$* 592
i do not know george w bush. %$* 592
i do know bill and hillary clinton. %$* 592
i have no idea whether george w bush in his own heart is a religious man. %$* 592
but in his public persona, he is the least religious president i could ever imagine. %$* 592
a man without a shred of doubt about the wisdom of his policies. %$* 592
a man without a shred of humility and modesty as he faces the difficult challenges brought on, i must say, by his own incompetence. %$* 592
a man filled with public piety but without a conscience. %$* 592
if one could ever imagine, ever imagine george w bush sitting around with his advisors and thinking about what he's gonna do and karl rove comes in and says i know what you gotta do you gotta do this, could you ever imagine george w bush saying – karl that's a great idea but i'm sorry, i'm a christian. %$* 592
one - %$* 592
the most important word in christian theology is the word no. %$* 592
there are things that i cannot do because my conscience will not allow it. %$* 592
it's inconceivable to me that that could ever happen. %$* 592
precisely because the republican party has been so successfully political, politically it is incumbent upon people who oppose them to expose their use of religion for political purposes. %$* 592
to protect religion in america against those, the single greatest abusers of religion in america uh the republican party, the christian conservatives and other people who are degrading everything meaningful, serious and spiritual in the tradition that they claim to represent. %$* 592
thank you. %$* 589
thank you very much alan wolfe. %$* 589
the next speaker, speaking against the motion will be albert raboteau. %$* 589
good evening. %$* 593
week after next, christians, the largest religious group in the nation will begin the season of lent. %$* 593
a period of prayer and fasting in preparation for easter. %$* 593
the holiest feast of the christian year. %$* 593
in that context i recall the voice of isiah speaking in the name of the lord. %$* 593
is not this the fast that i choose to loose the bonds of injustice? %$* 593
to undo the thongs of the yolk. %$* 593
to let the oppressed go free and to break every yolk. %$* 593
is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house? %$* 593
when you see the naked, to cover them. %$* 593
and not to hide your self from your own flesh and blood. %$* 593
in a land of super-abundance and obscene excess, a land of economic inequality and serious levels of intransigent poverty and homelessness, can we hear the voice of isiah and really claim that we in our nation are too religious? %$* 593
when we tally up our church attending statistics, and the large number of americans who believe in god, do we remember the words of amos, again speaking in the name of the lord. %$* 593
i hate, i despise your festivals and i take no delight in your solemn assemblies. %$* 593
but let justice roll down like the waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. %$* 593
by amos' standard of justice enacted equitably for rich and poor alike, can we really claim that we are too religious? %$* 593
mired down in a preemptive war that has cost thousands upon thousands of lives with no end in sight. %$* 593
can we listen to the prophecy of micah, they shall beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruning hooks. %$* 593
a nation shall not lift up sword against nation. %$* 593
neither shall they study war anymore. %$* 593
can we listen to these words without a pang of remorse that our efforts to build peace and have been so feeble and so ineffectual. %$* 593
do we observe the commandments delivered in the sermon on the mount. %$* 593
do not resist evil-doers. %$* 593
if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also. %$* 593
love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. %$* 593
no one can serve two masters, you cannot serve god and mammon. %$* 593
do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink or what you will wear. %$* 593
do not judge, lest you be judged. %$* 593
do unto others as you would have them do unto you. %$* 593
be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. %$* 593
do we obey the singular new commandment proclaimed in john's gospel? %$* 593
love one another as i have loved you. %$* 593
by this shall all know that you are my disciples by how you love another. %$* 593
a love in action, not just words. %$* 593
feed the hungry. %$* 593
give drink to the thirsty. %$* 593
welcome the stranger. %$* 593
clothe the naked. %$* 593
tend to the sick. %$* 593
visit those in prison. %$* 593
for when you do these things to the least among you, you do them to christ. %$* 593
the prophetic strain in the hebrew and christian scriptures has down through the ages constantly challenged religious communities to focus on the one thing necessary. %$* 593
what the prophets articulate in word and gesture and in the case of christ literally in body according to christian belief, is the divine pathos, to use abraham joshua heschel's wonderful term. %$* 593
god's compassionate concern for the plight of human kind. %$* 593
especially for the weak, the outcast, the widow, the sojourner. %$* 593
the prophet experiences the divine pathos as a fire in the bones, compelling him or her to speak and act. %$* 593
in twentieth century america an amazing network of religious activists carried on this prophetic tradition. %$* 593
dorothy day, co- founder of the catholic worker movement, established houses of hospitality to feed, clothe and shelter the indigent. %$* 593
based on the belief in our personal responsibility to live in solidarity with the poor. %$* 593
aj musty, non-violent agitator and labor organizer, longtime director of the fellowship of reconciliation taught that suffering in the cause of justice releases god's presence into the stream of human history. %$* 593
abraham joshua heschel applied the concept of divine pathos to the modern struggle for social justice. %$* 593
as he marched with king from selma to montgomery and organized active protests against the vietnam war. %$* 593
howard thurman, preacher, ecumenist and mystic, co-pastored the first interracial and inter-faith congregation in the nation. %$* 593
and spent a lifetime teaching that the search for community is part of the very structure of our being. %$* 593
thomas merton, catholic contemplative monk wrote compellingly about the necessity of solitude, silence and simplicity for discovering our true selves, beyond the false persona fed by the consumerism of our mass society. %$* 593
martin luther king junior deeply rooted in the black religious tradition of suffering christianity arising out of slavery, confronted racial and economic inequality and argued that we have to transform america from a thing oriented to a person oriented society, lest we succumb to the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism that continue to afflict us. %$* 593
if we heed the voices of these modern prophets and their ancient predecessors, we won't conclude that americans or america are too religious. %$* 593
if we take heed we will see how often we preach religion while practicing consumerist, conspicuous consumption. %$* 593
how often we turn piety into another form of ego gratification. %$* 593
useful for comforting the comfortable and empowering the powerful. %$* 593
we will see how easy and seductive it has always been to blunt the prophetic drive of religion to radically change our lives and our society. %$* 593
we will see that we are not nearly religious enough. %$* 593
thank you very much albert raboteau. %$* 589
and now speaking for the motion, susan jacoby. %$* 589
i am not an ordained minister or a rabbi. %$* 594
so it seems i am here to speak to you tonight in the role of the atheist in the room. %$* 594
since these are oxford rules i'm just going to pretend this is the oxford union and say that america is too bloody religious. %$* 594
now the case for god's country is being made in great biblical language and the scholarly language of princeton, the university of chicago and soon to come that might fortress of religion, the brookings institution. %$* 594
uh but ladies and gentlemen let us step down from the ivory tower and the church steeple into what one of president bush's advisors famously called the reality based world. %$* 594
down here in the reality based world, we must first talk about the retrograde form of religion that holds one third of americans in thrall. %$* 594
this is the proportion of americans who say that they believe every word in the bible is literally true. %$* 594
not merely inspired by god but the literal handwriting of god. %$* 594
one out of three. %$* 594
what an astounding statistic. %$* 594
reflecting a level of credulity that exists nowhere else in the developed world. %$* 594
the widespread persistence of such an anti-diluvian form of faith is a true affliction in american society and demonstrates alas, that the liberty of conscience guaranteed by our constitution also leaves us the liberty to bind ourselves with the chains of unreason. %$* 594
our opponents would have you believe that those of us who consider america too bloody religious are concerned mainly with legalistic issues involving the separation of church and state. %$* 594
in fact our nation's excessive religiosity affects individual lives and public policy in ways that are often matters of life and death. %$* 594
i could offer two hours worth of examples or eight hours but mindful of the clock, here are just two. %$* 594
first, consider that the united states is the only country in the western world with the death penalty. %$* 594
every study of this issue has shown that pro death penalty views correlate closely with biblically based religious beliefs. %$* 594
justice antonin scalia, a roman catholic so far to the right that he is at odds with his own church on the issue, more catholic than the pope you might say – believes that since all legitimate governmental power is derived from god and god has the power of life and death, so too must governments. %$* 594
in a 2002 speech scalia quoted paul's famous epistle to the romans about government heads being duly designated ministers of god to avenge evil. %$* 594
then scalia noted nostalgically and i quote – “few doubted the morality of the death penalty in an age that believed in the divine right of kings.” well yes those were surely the good old days. %$* 594
and doesn't it say something about our excessive respect for religion in america that this is considered a perfectly respectable position. %$* 594
scalia, after all, is a supreme court justice but i can assure you can find his sentiments in less elevated english on every crack pot right wing web site. %$* 594
let us consider another very different example. %$* 594
the united states has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers again in the developed world, why? %$* 594
not because american teenagers are more sexually active than any other but because conservative religious believers have blocked sensible sex education programs and have made it as difficult as possible for teenagers to obtain contraceptives. %$* 594
just recently, we learned that the man in charge of the only federal birth control program for the poor, one dr. %$* 594
eric keroack spends much of his time appearing at religiously sponsored abstinence conferences, where he promotes the notion that premarital sex ruins your chances for lasting marriage because too much sex makes you lose too much oxytocin. %$* 594
the hormone of pleasurable intimacy released with every orgasm. %$* 594
too many orgasms and there go your precious bodily fluids for the rest of your life. %$* 594
it seems that dr. %$* 594
keroack is a disciple not of the lord, but of general jack d.ripper from the movie doctor strangelove. %$* 594
uh this would be funny if our tax dollars were not paying this lunatic to peddle his nutty combination of right wing faith and junk science. %$* 594
now – what of the majority of americans who are the kind of religious believers who have made room for secular knowledge in their house of faith. %$* 594
martin luther king has been very much on my mind recently too. %$* 594
because it’s been forty years since he made his courageous speech denouncing the vietnam war at the riverside church. %$* 594
some of you were probably there. %$* 594
the most important points to be made here are that dr. %$* 594
king, both on civil rights and the war, was speaking truth to power from outside the government. %$* 594
and he was speaking to a morality that transcended every religion and was in direct opposition to the religious beliefs of many americans at the time. %$* 594
it is utterly nauseating to hear representatives of the religious right today, cloak themselves in dr. %$* 594
king's mantle when their spiritual ancestors were standing in the school house door and waving bibles in support of segregation. %$* 594
so if you're going to talk about religion and all the good it can do in society, you also have to talk about religion and all the bad it can do and not pretend that bad religion is somewhere out there and has nothing to do at all with good religion. %$* 594
our opponents suggest that reasonable religion does have nothing to do with extremist religion. %$* 594
but there are a great many more people of unreasonable faith in this country than sophisticated experts on theology would like to believe. %$* 594
and would like you to believe. %$* 594
barry lynn has mentioned attempts to inject intelligent design in our schools. %$* 594
but that's just the tip of the iceberg. %$* 594
on october 30th, 2005, the pew forum on religion in public life released the results of an opinion poll that was ignored in the press because hurricane katrina had slammed into the gulf coast the day before. %$* 594
among the findings, two thirds of americans want both evolution and creationism to be taught in public schools. %$* 594
fewer than half of americans accept any form of evolution, including evolution guided by god by the way. %$* 594
finally, an astonishing forty two percent say that all living beings have existed in their present form since the beginning of time. %$* 594
these religiously based beliefs are an intellectual disaster for our country. %$* 594
americans of all faiths have confused the freedom of religion in our constitution, which allows people to believe whatever they want, with the respect for the beliefs themselves. %$* 594
last fall in a lecture at a church affiliated college in the south, i said that i do not respect the belief that the universe was created in seven days. %$* 594
even though of course i respect any one's right to believe that. %$* 594
a very polite young woman came up to me afterward and said that she was an evangelical christian and was personally insulted by my saying that i didn't respect her beliefs about creation. %$* 594
i asked her if she genuinely respected one - %$* 594
my atheism and she admitted that she didn't. %$* 594
but she said she did feel sorry for me. %$* 594
she also told me she wanted to be a high school teacher because she, but she wasn't going to become one because she was sure she would prevented from bearing witness to her faith. %$* 594
i suggested that she wait and indulge in some free inquiry before she made such a decision at age eighteen. %$* 594
i can't do that she said. %$* 594
with the accent on can't. %$* 594
there's no better idea than the truth. %$* 594
this was a young mind in faith based chains in the 21st century in a nation whose constitution was written by men of the enlightenment. %$* 594
it is this young woman and millions of young women and men like her who represented the tragedy of americans overly deferential toward religion. %$* 594
what we need in this country is not more faith of any kind but a new age of reason. %$* 594
thank you. %$* 594
thank you very much susan jacoby. %$* 589
and now the final speaker against the, tonight's motion will be william galston. %$* 589
the topic before us is one that stirs understandable passions. %$* 595
and as if the topic weren't enough uh our worthy opponents are doing their best to pour gas on the flames. %$* 595
but i'd like to proceed somewhat differently. %$* 595
uh i'd like to appeal if i may to your reason. %$* 595
to your fair mindedness and to your sense of our shared national history not the myopia of the moment. %$* 595
let me tell you what this debate is not about. %$* 595
it's not about whether you have to be religious to be a good american. %$* 595
of course you don't. %$* 595
nor it is about whether you approve of the way that the most intense elements of the republican coalition speaking in the name of religion, have conducted themselves. %$* 595
as a lifelong activist democrat i sure don't. %$* 595
neither do most americans and obviously neither do you. %$* 595
nor finally is it about whether religion in america is without excess or without sin. %$* 595
of course it isn't for the simple reason it is a human institution. %$* 595
here i believe is the real question. %$* 595
if you believe america is too religious, you must believe that we'd be a better country if we were less religious or maybe not religious at all. %$* 595
that's the proposition i'd like to contest. %$* 595
now, admittedly this isn't an easy argument or inquiry to conduct. %$* 595
it's rather like asking whether bedford falls would have been better or a better place without george bailey. %$* 595
well quite obviously i'm no angel and i'm certainly not frank capra but i'm gonna do my best to persuade you. %$* 595
invoking your reason, your fair mindedness and your sense of history, that america is better off with the religion it has with all its flaws than without it. %$* 595
i want to make three simple point, points. %$* 595
first of all, from the very beginning of our history, religious americans have been at the forefront of most if not all of the turning points in our history. %$* 595
consider the revolutionary war, where for ten years prior to our declaration of independence, protestant ministers from the pulpit, were teaching the lessons of liberty. %$* 595
and so when thomas jefferson came to draft the declaration of independence, he didn't have to make up a new theory. %$* 595
he only had to do what he said he did years later in a letter to a friend, to state the plain common sense of the american mind. %$* 595
or consider the anti-slavery movement. %$* 595
first in england and then in the united states, religious americans were in the lead. %$* 595
after the civil war with the rise of industrial capitalist, the teachers of the social gospel spearheaded progressive reform. %$* 595
they were at the forefront of concern for immigrants and for the poor. %$* 595
as professor elshtain has already pointed out. %$* 595
in the 1920s the catholic church engaged with organized labor and its leading intellectuals and theologians set the stage for the new deal. %$* 595
in the 1950s and 1960s, the civil rights movement of course. %$* 595
uh but the anti-war movement, the anti-vietnam war movement was fueled and sustained among other things by religious passions. %$* 595
today, movements to fight aids, famine and genocide are led by americans of faith. %$* 595
last year i had the privilege of attending a rally on the washington mall against our government's inaction in darfur. %$* 595
and i can tell you if you took the religious people out of that crowd, there would hardly have been anyone left. %$* 595
here’s my second point. %$* 595
religious americans are among our most engaged citizens today and their engagement strengthens our community. %$* 595
i'm not gonna deluge you with statistics. %$* 595
but i can tell you this – religious americans are far more likely than non-religious americans to give to charitable causes and that includes non-religious causes. %$* 595
religious americans are far more likely to volunteer than are non-religious americans and that includes for non-religious causes. %$* 595
religious americans are far more likely to participate in our nation's politics. %$* 595
to follow it closely. %$* 595
to attend political meetings. %$* 595
to join local reform groups. %$* 595
to contact elected officials and even to vote than are non-religious americans. %$* 595
and all of these generalizations hold true after one corrects for income, marital status and all the other variables that social scientists like to play with. %$* 595
here's my third point – religious americans, unlike what you have heard from our worthy opponents are not, repeat not a threat to our liberties. %$* 595
an overwhelming majority of religious americans practice what one eminent scholar has termed a private faith. %$* 595
it is private rather than public. %$* 595

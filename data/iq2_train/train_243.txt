call it what you will. %$* 144
we have a democratic president, democratic control of the senate and democratic control of the house, and we did nothing about these issues. %$* 144
when you can get any kind of mix of politics-- %$* 144
i don't care whether they're the republicans or the democrats-- %$* 144
who can really change what you're talking about changing, the tax rates, the immigration codes, you name it, i'll agree with everything you want to say. %$* 144
but in the meantime, these programs are in jeopardy. %$* 144
and everybody who has looked at it has agreed that they are in jeopardy in one form or another. %$* 144
and i would therefore say to you, as long as you can sort of hypothesize these unavailable, impossible programs, sure, you can find other ways to solve it. %$* 144
but in the meantime, we're living with these programs. %$* 144
we haven't been able to solve it, and nobody's been able to do it since 1983. %$* 144
howard dean. %$* 13
here's the problem with that argument. %$* 634
i agree. %$* 634
the programs are in some jeopardy. %$* 634
why? %$* 634
because one side of the political aisle wants them to be in jeopardy. %$* 634
they've never liked social security. %$* 634
they think the federal government should be drowned in a bathtub-- %$* 634
i do not think it's fair to take away social security because there is an intransigent group of people in the house who refuse to do anything about it at all. %$* 634
all right. %$* 13
but i just want-- %$* 13
i want to point out that your debate opponents tonight did not take that position. %$* 13
that's true, they didn't. %$* 634
but mort just defended them. %$* 634
thank you. %$* 633
margaret hoover. %$* 13
straw man. %$* 633
to answer jeff's question, insolvency, this inflammatory rhetoric is not rhetoric that mort and i made up. %$* 633
in insolvency is the word used by cbo, by actuaries of social security. %$* 633
and it refers to the fact that these programs will not be able to deliver on their promises by that year 2037.not my inflammatory rhetoric, the rhetoric of social security actuaries. %$* 633
now, with governor dean, you've agreed that these programs are in jeopardy. %$* 633
to the extent that these programs are in jeopardy, you are then agreeing implicitly with the motion that those promises that have been delivered-- %$* 633
or that have been promised to junior will not be able to be delivered upon, and therefore, his future is imperiled. %$* 633
did she get you on that? %$* 13
no. %$* 634
what i-- %$* 634
no. %$* 634
my opening statement was that we don't have a medicare and social security problem in this country. %$* 634
we have a political and an economic problem in this country because of bad leadership in both the business sphere and the government. %$* 634
so if the argument here is social security and medicare, grandma's benefits are imperiling junior's future, no. %$* 634
the political class is imperiling junior's future because we have a lousy group of politicians that can't get their act together. %$* 634
i don't think we should take that out of grandma's hide. %$* 634
what we need is new politicians, not new grandmas. %$* 634
howard, i thought, though, that what i heard the other side saying is not-- %$* 13
they're not talking-- %$* 13
they're not talking about wanting to-- %$* 13
they're not talking about wanting to cut grandma's benefits now. %$* 13
but they're talking about wanting to cut junior's benefits when junior is a grandpa, later on, they're talking about the future, are they not? %$* 13
all reforms you're talking about cutting-- %$* 246
all reforms are talking in some way or other about cutting benefits now. %$* 246
we've already raised the eligibility age to 67.that's going to be a 13 percent benefit cut. %$* 246
that's not somebody way down the road. %$* 246
that's a 13 percent benefit cut. %$* 246
let us be honest about this. %$* 246
i watch television and people, supposedly forthright people, get up there and say, "why don't politicians tell us there won't be any social security for us? %$* 246
" they don't get up there and say, "why don't they be honest and say we're only going to get about 80 percent of our social security? %$* 246
" the words are inflammatory and sadly misleading. %$* 246
we can solve the problem with modest social security tax increases, by raising the cap, and let me talk a little bit about medicare, howard's forte, because margaret brought up the fact that this is some kind of side issue. %$* 246
why do we think medicare is going to go off the rails? %$* 246
it's not the aging issue because if it were the aging issue they would by and large rise to the same proportion of gdp as social security did. %$* 246
it's that health care costs are rising very rapidly, and i guess we have to repeat this over and over again, rising health care costs can undue medicare and medicaid, down the road, not the next 10 years, but well down the road, unless we have very, very serious reform-- %$* 246
okay. %$* 13
and that is not a side issue. %$* 246
let's bring margaret in. %$* 13
margaret hoover. %$* 13
i agree with you. %$* 633
i believe we agree with you, that rising health care costs are very, very important and one of the driving predictors in long term spending of these problems. %$* 633
the issue here though is about benefits. %$* 633
and medicare and medicaid are health care benefits. %$* 633
and to the extent that health care costs are careening out of control and must be reformed, this is again an implicit affirmation of the motion that benefits are imperiling junior's future. %$* 633
i would disagree. %$* 634
howard dean. %$* 13
i think in fact you just affirmed our side of the motion-- %$* 634
which is the negative side. %$* 634
the fact is it isn't the benefits, it's the system. %$* 634
if you capitated everybody's-- %$* 634
it's the same thing. %$* 633
no, it is certainly not the same thing. %$* 634
what i get in benefits has nothing to do with how i pay for those benefits. %$* 634
the problem is not the benefits that grandma's getting, the problem is the way we pay for health care in this country. %$* 634
you couldn't be in the automobile industry-- %$* 634
here's what would happen if the automobile industry were funded the way health care was, i would-- %$* 634
if i were ford motor, i would make 10 million cars a minute if i could because i'd get paid for every single one of them. %$* 634
this is an insane system. %$* 634
there's no-- %$* 634
the economic system doesn't work. %$* 634
you have to get rid of the fee for service system. %$* 634
and you have to have a global budget capitated care system which-- %$* 634
and actually in obama's plan, it's possible to do this because he's created these integrated networks, and if you pay them a fixed amount of money, let the professionals and-- %$* 634
get the insurance companies out of it, let the professionals and the patients figure out how they want to save those dollars, but they don't get additional dollars. %$* 634
so, margaret, howard's made the case that paying and the benefits are not the same thing. %$* 13
so let me go to the question of medicare benefits, do you see the need to actually reduce the level of benefit that-- %$* 13
i share the view just expressed that i want to completely redo the health care system, the medical profession, how they get paid, end fee for services-- %$* 144
change the whole hospital system, revolutionize the whole thing, and i'm ready as soon as that is done to take the same approach that you're talking about with respect to health care and social security. %$* 144
however, until then and in the slight possibility even when you were chairman of the democratic party that you weren't able to institute this in this country, in the slight possibility that that will not happen, let's find something to have a fallback position just in case we can't revolutionize the country. %$* 144
margaret, can you take on that question of whether you're actually advocating a reduction in the benefits, the stuff you get from the doctor, the care. %$* 13
i actually in one sense agree with governor dean. %$* 633
i agree that the health care system needs to be reformed so that medical costs come down because i agree with the premise that it is medical costs that are careening out of control. %$* 633
i think governor dean and i have dramatically different ideas about how we would contain costs. %$* 633
right, but i think they're saying that what's-- %$* 13
i think what they're-- %$* 13
the words they're putting in your mouth is saying what i'm putting into the question is that you're actually suggesting that people have-- %$* 13
there's too much care, they're getting too much great medical stuff, and that, that needs to be reduced as well as the cost. %$* 13
well, in some sense in the medical profession there is too much care because it's fee for service, you have-- %$* 633
mort has written about tort reform, you have moved patients away from the marginal cost of their health care. %$* 633
and as a result, because they don’t know-- %$* 633
there’s no transparency. %$* 633
they don’t know how much they’re buying, paying for services. %$* 633
in addition, doctors are constantly checking boxes to cover their cya sort of movement so that they don’t get sued. %$* 633
you have an enormous amount of spending in health care that is unnecessary. %$* 633
howard dean. %$* 13
i have to disagree with that. %$* 634
the fact is that incentives work. %$* 634
we just have bad incentives. %$* 634
the reason that health care costs are going up at three times the rate of inflation is not because of tort reform and all these other problems. %$* 634
it’s because we get paid to spend more money. %$* 634
let’s say you’re a hospital executive. %$* 634
right now, under the present system, you’re going to hire as many cardiologists who do catheterization, get as many mri machines as you can because they’re huge profit centers. %$* 634
and you’re going to hire as few nurse practitioners and internists as you can because they don’t make you any money. %$* 634
we need exactly the opposite. %$* 634
we have an illness system here, not a wellness system. %$* 634
that’s the problem with our health care system. %$* 634
and so it actually encour-- %$* 634
i don’t think most doctors do this but i-- %$* 634
some hospital executives-- %$* 634
i know people who work in ers where the ceo goes through once a month to boost up morale and says, “by the way, we’re a little short upstairs. %$* 634
you got to admit a few more people.” this is insane. %$* 634
you do not have to reduce even the quality of care. %$* 634
we’ve got to start keeping people well and have the money go to people who are trying to stay well and doctors and hospitals who are trying to keep people well. %$* 634
we’re not talking about cutting benefits because benefits are not the problem. %$* 634
it’s the way we pay for health care. %$* 634
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
no, but what you are saying, if the current system-- %$* 144
and i couldn’t agree with you more about the fee for services, because it’s counter to everything and more. %$* 144
you pay for more, not for better in that system. %$* 144
and i agree with that, okay. %$* 144
all i’m saying to you is that it is almost impossible for me to imagine that you’re going to change that, at least within my lifetime, and maybe within the lifetime of junior. %$* 144
and i have a couple of young juniors. %$* 144
i just don’t see that happening. %$* 144
i hope it does. %$* 144
but i don’t know what it’s going to take. %$* 144
all i can say is i’ll give you an example. %$* 144
tort reform in new york state-- %$* 144
a whole group of us tried to get a cap on damages of $250,000 as a maximum for tort liability medical issues. %$* 144
we couldn’t get it. %$* 144
but if we had gotten it, we would have saved $600 million a year in new york state alone, just for the hospitals. %$* 144
now, it’s almost impossible to get these things done. %$* 144
in the meantime, i want to make sure that the health care system or the medicare and medicaid and the social security system do not break the bank, do not destroy the future of this country. %$* 144
when we are able to change those other things, i’ll agree with you. %$* 144
jeff madrick. %$* 13
we have to-- %$* 246
i have to make one point very clear. %$* 246
when you reduce medicare benefits, you tend, except in rather narrow ways, you tend to raise health care expenditures for the rest of the country. %$* 246
one example, president obama considered agreeing to raise the eligibility age of medicare from 65 to 67, from my point of view an outrageous move. %$* 246
kaiser family foundation did a study about that. %$* 246
what happens? %$* 246
those 66- and 67- year-olds need insurance somewhere else. %$* 246
on average, to simplify the insurance they will pay for or their employers will pay for or the new health exchanges will pay, the price will go up. %$* 246
america will pay more in health care with those kinds of reforms unless we believe in triage, unless we simply say 66- and 67-year-olds, which is probably what the insurance companies would like to hear, let’s not bother getting health insurance for them. %$* 246
and that includes the ryan plan. %$* 246
it raises health care expenditures. %$* 246
so this is a difficult issue. %$* 246
to cut back medicare benefits significantly affects the entire health care system. %$* 246
keep that in mind. %$* 246
margaret, i’m a little confused about something. %$* 13
in the same way that you feel that you got howard to admit that the system is in peril, that things don’t change, i think they’re getting you to admit that it’s pretty fixable, that there’s stuff you can do and you fix it and it’ll be okay again. %$* 13
i actually agree with that. %$* 633
i just have a difference-- %$* 633
so-- %$* 633
so where do you-- %$* 13
where’s the dividing line between these two teams? %$* 13
i mean, i just think that we’re arguing this notion of benefits, and medicaid and medicare are benefits. %$* 633
and the way these benefits are structured are imperiling junior’s future. %$* 633
and i think they’re saying the same thing, but they’re trying to say it’s not the benefits. %$* 633
it’s the health care. %$* 633
but the benefits are the health care. %$* 633
jeff madrick. %$* 13
you cannot cut the benefits without raising health care-- %$* 246
medicare-- %$* 246
health care expenditures overall. %$* 246
i just gave the kaiser family foundation example. %$* 246
they said it would raise health care spending in america by twice as much as it would save medicare. %$* 246
that imperils junior’s future. %$* 246
if you had-- %$* 246
all right. %$* 13
i’d like to go to some questions from the audience now, and remember, when the mic comes to you, please stand up and state your name and please ask a question, and try to keep it on topic to move along discussion towards conclusion of our motion. %$* 13
and right down in front, yeah. %$* 13
the closest person to you. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
if you could stand up and state your name, and we just want to give the camera a moment to find you, and it has. %$* 13
yes. %$* 635
my name is reba shimanski, and i have two quick solutions to the problem. %$* 635
you get rid of the-- %$* 635
i really would like to ask you to ask a question. %$* 13
i'd like them to comment. %$* 635
that is my question. %$* 635
okay. %$* 13
phrase it so that it's a question. %$* 13
you remove the wage cap which now stands at 106, 7, $800 on the fica tax and have wealthy people pay the same percentage as everyone else. %$* 635
social security would be overflowing with revenue for the next hundred years. %$* 635
two, if-- %$* 635
you don't take into consideration the fact that if the unemployment rate ever went down again there would be a big surge in revenue. %$* 635
for medicare, the one easy solution would be for the federal government to negotiate with drug companies. %$* 635
and that would bring down drug prices. %$* 635
and that also would save medicare costs. %$* 635
okay. %$* 13
also-- %$* 635
no, no, no. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i'm going to stop you there. %$* 13
i'm going to stop you there because i asked for 30 second. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and then at the end of that, you can say, isn't that right? %$* 13
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
no, i mean, look, there are all kinds of different programs, including some of them that are implicit in your question or comments. %$* 144
and the real problem is you have to weigh the probability of getting some of those things done. %$* 144
i wish we could get them done, frankly. %$* 144
i wish we could get toward liability. %$* 144
i wish we could change fee for services. %$* 144
i wish we could change the whole system. %$* 144
i have here a little cartoon from the new yorker, just to show you. %$* 144
this is two-- %$* 144
two policemen interrogating bernie madoff. %$* 144
the lights are shining on him, and the cop says, "all right, madoff, where did you get the idea of paying early investors with money from late investors? %$* 144
" he says, "from the social security system." now, all i'm saying is-- %$* 144
wow, are you running for president from texas, mort? %$* 246
we have to look at these things-- %$* 144
we have to look at these things and make them as self-sustaining financially as possible. %$* 144
you can't revolutionize the whole country to solve this problem because it'll never get done. %$* 144
and we will not necessarily go broke in a total sense. %$* 144
but we will-- %$* 144
as a country, we will end up in a very, very different kind of place. %$* 144
howard dean. %$* 13
you know, it will get done, and it is getting done. %$* 634
and of course these folks on the right are going to be horrified to hear me say this, but in fact it's happening in the private sector. %$* 634
government never leads. %$* 634
the private sector is already-- %$* 634
you have kaiser. %$* 634
you have geisinger which is going to be the model for the vermont single payer that we're trying to put in. %$* 634
the private sector today is figuring out how to do capitated care and how to pay hospitals and doctors differently because the current system doesn't work. %$* 634
again, let me emphasize, the title of this debate is, resolved, grandma's benefits endanger junior's future. %$* 634
they do not. %$* 634
it is political bad management. %$* 634
it is political intransigence. %$* 634
it is bad economic management, but it's not grandma's benefits. %$* 634
and the private sector is doing something about it right now. %$* 634
eventually, the government will figure it out. %$* 634
gentleman on the aisle in the argyle sweater. %$* 13
and-- %$* 13
i encourage you to improve upon the question model. %$* 13
i'll do my best, with all due respect. %$* 636
my-- %$* 636
to the person who spoke earlier. %$* 636
my name is mark turner. %$* 636
okay. %$* 13
i think tonight and every night when you turn on the tube you can see that we have the intelligence to have this debate, but i believe our politics dummy us down. %$* 636
so my question is, is there a play on history going on here? %$* 636
in 1980, during the reagan revolution, after there was a discussion about social security-- %$* 636
by 1982, the public had spoken. %$* 636
many grandmas and grandpas voted, and it got reagan and tip o'neill to sit down. %$* 636
so maybe we should expand the table and have more juniors at the table so that their voice is going to be part of this democratic process. %$* 636
and-- %$* 636
margaret hoover is our junior representative. %$* 13
more juniors here to see if in fact you'll channel the past and go for politicians who promise us a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage. %$* 636
i don't think they'll go for that. %$* 636
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
you were good at the question, mark. %$* 13
thanks for the hoover reference, too, there. %$* 633
you know, i couldn't agree with you more. %$* 633
juniors do need to be part of this debate. %$* 633
and the one thing that really characterizes the millennial generation is a desire to be part of the solution. %$* 633
but i will say when we talk about this compromise that happened with tip o'neill and ronald reagan in 1983, we have to remember too, they were months away from seniors not getting their benefit checks. %$* 633
so one of the things i worry about is that politicians need their next election to be hanging in the balance before they can actually be mobilized to do anything. %$* 633
howard, would you like to comment on that as well? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 634
i actually think that's exactly right. %$* 634
but again, that's a systemic problem, not a benefit problem. %$* 634
and i'm really in favor of getting millennials to have their place at the table. %$* 634
and i'm incredibly glad that they're dancing on wall street right now. %$* 634
woman in the green sweater, standing up. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
hi. %$* 637
my name is chloe hines, and i was just wondering if we could elaborate a little bit on what it would look like if we were creating healthier seniors, if the people who are my age and margaret's age and under the age of the beneficiary line, what that-- %$* 637
what those benefits would look like, because i feel like the pool would be depleted at a much slower rate. %$* 637
and i see that point being made. %$* 637
so i'm wondering if we can clarify a little bit on the distinction between the health care and the benefits, because i see that happening, but it seems like it's getting muddled up in rhetoric. %$* 637
if you-- %$* 18
let-- %$* 13
let me let mort zuckerman go. %$* 13
the fact is health care has improved dramatically. %$* 144
that's why longevity has improved so dramatically. %$* 144
so we are in fact seeing a totally different aging of the population. %$* 144
we had something really unique which is that there were baby boomers. %$* 144
we have 79 million of them coming into this system over the next several years, without going into the exact number. %$* 144
their benefits alone will add $3 trillion a year to this thing. %$* 144
we've got to find some way to make that still viable. %$* 144
i don't disagree with anything you're saying in one sense, which is that we can improve the health care system, without question. %$* 144
and we are improving it. %$* 144
and all kinds of benefits are coming from it, longevity being the first one. %$* 144
when we-- %$* 144
the original idea of health care was not necessarily to-- %$* 144
i mean of social security, was not necessarily to provide retirement income for people to the ages of 90, whatever that new longevity will take us to. %$* 144
when that was passed-- %$* 144
as i said, the median age was 62.that was the median longevity. %$* 144
we're now at 80. %$* 144
there's nothing wrong with taking that into account. %$* 144
howard. %$* 13
i'll just be very quick about this. %$* 634
what your health care would look like is people would begin investing in your wellness at your age so that you wouldn't be diabetic, having dialysis, advanced atherosclerotic heart disease when you got to be my age. %$* 634
and so the whole-- %$* 634
capitated care gives a financial impetus and incentive to take care of all the people in the system when they're young so they don't use up more money when they're older. %$* 634
now, i am not going to get into this. %$* 634
end of life care is another area. %$* 634
and i'm not going to get into this in a big way because it takes a lot of time. %$* 634
but the truth is, most seniors will make the right end of life decisions. %$* 634
but right now, hospitals and doctors are incentivized to stick as many tubes as they possibly can in them and you're going out the door. %$* 634
all you've got to do for that-- %$* 634
to fix that is not have death panels like sarah palin was talking about. %$* 634
just turn the decisions back to the seniors by living wills and durable power of attorneys. %$* 634
and i hope everybody in this room has one. %$* 634
okay. %$* 13
can i say something? %$* 246
yeah, jeff. %$* 13
i really hope the debate and what you take away from it can stick to the facts. %$* 246
yes, there is greater longevity. %$* 246
as big a problem for the social security system has been the fact that wages haven't grown and that there's inequality in america. %$* 246
when wages don't grow, people put in less money into the social security system. %$* 246
when there's inequality, a lot more people are above the cap that woman was correctly talking about. %$* 246
even saying that, however, let me repeat what i said at the outset. %$* 246
here were the simple numbers. %$* 246
for all the inflammatory language about the number of people who are getting old and longevity and the trillions of dollars and so forth, social security is going up from five percent to six percent of gdp. and ma'am, you are correct, we could solve that problem merely by eliminating the cap. %$* 246
margaret hoover has a look on her face that-- %$* 13
that i-- %$* 13
merely by eliminating the cap we would not have any deficit in the future. %$* 246
margaret. %$* 13
i just-- %$* 633
it seems to me as though you're setting up this false choice, in saying, we don't need to save social security. %$* 633
six percent of gdp is nothing. %$* 633
you know, 6 percent of gdp is more than $800 billion less than $900 billion. %$* 633
that's not nothing. %$* 633
and for an economy that is $14 trillion in debt, it's the ben franklin saying, if you mind your pennies, the dollars will take care of themselves. %$* 633
so this notion that we can just sort of ignore one and just take it is just fiscally irresponsible. %$* 633
neither howard, nor i, nor i think mort, nor even you suggest that we should ignore the problem. %$* 246
we are saying the fix is not dramatic for social security. %$* 246
i don't think i'm even-- %$* 246
i think i've said enough on that. %$* 246
okay. %$* 13
let me go to another question. %$* 13
sir, you're wearing a black turtleneck and you're in the dark, if you could come down a few steps just so the cameras can see you and light up, few more steps so that i can see you though, that's great, thanks. %$* 13
my name is dan tighe and i heard governor dean say that there was more than $2 trillion in the trust fund for social security, and mr. %$* 638
madrick say that there never was a trust fund, that it was always pay as you go. %$* 638
it seems that there's a fundamental disagreement between the two of you. %$* 638
could you clarify which of the two statements is correct? %$* 638
yeah, it's basically a technical issue. %$* 246
we've been collecting a lot more payroll taxes than we've had to pay out. %$* 246
that should be a surplus in the system, a trust fund, it's become ious from the federal government. %$* 246
people thought there should be a locked box, the federal government should never be able to spend that money. %$* 246
the federal government did spend that money and gave this trust fund debt. %$* 246
is the federal government ever going to renege on that debt? %$* 246
if it reneges on that debt, it's going to renege on a whole lot of debt, and we have a much bigger problem-- %$* 246
we would have much bigger problems. %$* 246
so it's really just a technical issue. %$* 246
a rejoinder from this side? %$* 13
well, let me just say-- %$* 144
mort zuckerman. %$* 13
when reagan and tip o'neill and-- %$* 18
got together and restructured social security, we had something like $25 million in that trust fund. %$* 18
it's now up to about $2.6 trillion and it'll be about $3.1 trillion before we have so many more people receiving it than paying into it, that that money is basically going to disappear, and it disappears according to the best actuarial judgments at this point, in 2036 and 2037.the whole idea is to find some way to keep that in a sense viable and liquid and not insolvent, so i think that's basically what we're talking about. %$* 18
if you don't do anything about it now, it's very nice to say let's find some other way to deal with it, but frankly we've done it 40 times, okay? %$* 18
so i don't see that this is a great issue here, and i agree, let's lift the cap so that the wealthy pay more, et cetera, et cetera, but we've got to keep it solvent, and we've got to keep it solvent for a long period of time for a lot of elderly people. %$* 18
ma'am, yeah, no, i'm sorry, go back two rows, thanks, that's right. %$* 13
hi, my name is barbara title %$* 639
can you hold the mic a little closer to you? %$* 13
yes, my name is barbara title. %$* 639
up until 10 years ago, the age where you could have earned unlimited earnings and still collect unemployment was 70.ten years ago they reduced that. %$* 639
why? %$* 639
i think 10 years ago at 65 or 66 you can earn unlimited money and still collect your social security. %$* 639
i think that probably it's a technical question that's off the topic that we're trying to get to at the moment, unless, jeff, you want to take this? %$* 13
it was just one of many reforms that have reduced social security benefits. %$* 246
people keep talking about the reagan-o'neill agreement. %$* 246
the reagan-o'neill agreement cut benefits. %$* 246
it used to be that-- %$* 246
in that period 52 percent-- %$* 246
social security replaced 52 percent of preretirement income. %$* 246
so you're saying it now replaces-- %$* 13
this is an average-- %$* 246
jeff, you're saying it's a little dose of what this side is recommending be done. %$* 13
it's a little dose-- %$* 246
yes, it's a little does of what that side's recommending. %$* 246
they also raised-- %$* 246
they also raised payroll taxes significantly. %$* 246
all right, so since we have a good example, and thanks for that question, ma'am, is that brought to your side fairly? %$* 13
well, i-- %$* 144
we had not frankly addressed that particular issue. %$* 144
what we are saying is there's got to be some combination of factors that has to make the system viable for a much longer time than it currently is. %$* 144
and we think that's important. %$* 144
we've done it many times in the past. %$* 144
there is no problem in my judgment, no overwhelming problem in doing it now. %$* 144
it is true on the health care side that you have a real problem of the health care system. %$* 144
that is so difficult to do in the meantime, it seems to me. %$* 144
we've got to make sure that these various programs do not go bust or in fact put such a burden of debt on this country that we'll simply not be able to spend the money on so many other things whether it's education or infrastructure or police or whatever you have to do, and that-- %$* 144
it's just going to drain it. %$* 144
and in fact if you go from five percent of gdp to 13 percent of gdp which is where our health care costs are driving us, you're going to take a huge amount out of what we otherwise need for the kind of country that we'd like to think we want to have in the future. %$* 144
margaret, do you want to add to that? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 633
what seems to be agreed upon here, and what jeff just said, too, was that the fix is easy. %$* 633
we know what the fix is. %$* 633
and it's true, cbo has scored 30 different fixes for social security. %$* 633
but then if we agree that there needs to be a fix, we agree that there's a problem, and we agree that grandma's benefits are imperiling junior's future. %$* 633
well, let me, if i may, we agree that there needs to be a fix and we agree that there is a problem, but the problem is not grandma's benefits, it's the idiots in washington that won't fix it. %$* 634
we should not cut grandma’s benefits because we have an incompetent political class. %$* 634
that’s what we need-- %$* 634
let’s not reframe this thing. %$* 634
this is not about grandma’s benefits. %$* 634
it’s about getting people who will get stuff done in washington and cut out the nonsense. %$* 634
actually the motion does say “grandma’s benefits.” %$* 13
our fix-- %$* 634
you framed it wrong. %$* 634
okay, go ahead, jeff. %$* 13
our fix, margaret, is increasing taxes because we think it’s a low tax nation. %$* 246
the earlier fixes were reducing benefits with significant increases in taxes as well. %$* 246
so we have a difference. %$* 246
we’re not saying that social security will not have a shortfall. %$* 246
we are avoiding this inflammatory rhetoric about it’s going bust and longevity is doing it all and all that kind of thing. %$* 246
i have to do something for radio, which is one of those times when i want-- %$* 13
i need to read something twice, once with your enthusiastic and spontaneous applause at the beginning. %$* 13
so if you could do a round of applause, i’m going to do my line and then-- %$* 13
not yet. %$* 13
and then i’ll do the line again without your applause, so if you could give a round of applause, that would be great. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing out this motion: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” thank you. %$* 13
now i’m going to do it again. %$* 13
this is a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
two teams, two members-- %$* 13
two against two, arguing out this motion: "grandma's benefits imperil junior's future.” okay, back to questions. %$* 13
thank you for that. %$* 13
that was great applause. %$* 13
sir, right-- %$* 13
i’m looking right at you. %$* 13
and just wait for the mic to come. %$* 13
i think mr. %$* 18
zuckerman began to touch on this, but the debate has largely centered on fairness and solvency. %$* 18
but i was wondering if somebody could speak a bit more about the long-term economic impact in terms of if you spend money on these entitlement programs, that’s money that’s not going to be spent somewhere else and, for example, the fermi lab just had the plug pulled on it last week, and president obama is trying desperately to get more infrastructure spending. %$* 18
so i guess my question is-- %$* 18
well, your question is-- %$* 13
or real quick, can we discuss the long-term economic impact of not having that spending. %$* 18
would it be fair to say you’re asking whether the programs are going to be a drag on the economy, on growth, on productivity-- %$* 13
and thus imperiling junior’s future. %$* 18
okay, i’ll just put to the side arguing against. %$* 13
absolutely not. %$* 634
in fact-- %$* 634
howard dean. %$* 13
in fact, it’s a huge boost. %$* 634
florida, as an example, its economy is essentially built on social security. %$* 634
this is-- %$* 634
no, this is true. %$* 634
this is the multiplier effect. %$* 634
what these are is transfer payments. %$* 634
they are transfer payments to people who otherwise wouldn’t be spending money. %$* 634
every dime that goes into social security gets spent because these folks who were depending on social security have to spend everything in order to survive and to live. %$* 634
and so, this-- %$* 634
it creates all kinds of multiplier affects wherever they are. %$* 634
that’s why people like retirees living in their state. %$* 634
they don’t use much in the way of services other than health care which is mostly paid for by the fed, and they don’t have any kids in the schools and so forth and so on. %$* 634
so in fact, these so-called transfer entitlement programs are big boosts to the economy and not drags at all. %$* 634
let’s hear the other side respond to that. %$* 13
interesting point. %$* 13
well, i think that is true. %$* 144
the point that i would make, though, is that when people are paying the social security taxes, it’s when they’re working. %$* 144
we’re trying to protect that system for the people when they retire. %$* 144
it is certainly true that when they retire, this being in most cases their only source of income, they’re going to spend it. %$* 144
and i’m just as happy to have people, when they’re working, contribute more to this system to make sure that it is viable. %$* 144
okay. %$* 13
down front, you’ve been very patient. %$* 13
if you can stand up, and the mic’s coming to you. %$* 13
no, no-- %$* 13
i’m sorry. %$* 13
you’re going to have to be even more patient. %$* 13
i meant in the third row. %$* 13
sorry, sir, but if you could stand up. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
hi there. %$* 640
my name is-- %$* 640
oops. %$* 640
my name is alice silverman and i am a grandma who is very concerned about my juniors and my junior’s juniors, some of whom live in burlington, vermont, by the way. %$* 640
so my question-- %$* 640
and therefore they have health care. %$* 18
my question for the evening is how you all get to speak with your respective team members, so to speak, and continue to have them as reasonable and cooperative as the four of you seem to be tonight, so that we can really get some things done here. %$* 640
how can we love each other more? %$* 13
i-- %$* 144
look, there’s only one way to do that. %$* 144
i’m going to take that as more of an aspirational statement than a question, because i think we take your point. %$* 13
right next to you, yeah. %$* 13
hillary sisel jordan. %$* 641
my question is, you seem to all agree that what's germane to the debate is politics not working. %$* 641
and i'm just wondering, this isn't going, i don't think too far from the debate, is our politics as intransigent as the health care system? %$* 641

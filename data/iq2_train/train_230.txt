i think there are four issues for negotiation. %$* 596
there is settlements, there is the borders, there is the issue of refugees, there is the issue of jerusalem. %$* 596
nobody said that admitting us to the un will mean that we will not negotiate about all these issues. %$* 596
okay. %$* 13
that's what we're trying to come back to. %$* 13
and dore, i'm to understand why you say that can't happen. %$* 13
as one final point, please, it's very dangerous to say we admit, we accept palestinian, that they should have a state, but we don't agree with '67 borders because what that means is that you want us to have a bantustan like there was in south africa. %$* 596
there were also bantustans in south africa with kings, not only presidents. %$* 596
but that did not mean that people were free. %$* 596
they were subjected to discrimination and apartheid system. %$* 596
let me bring in aaron david miller. %$* 13
look, we're getting away from some very basic issues here. %$* 138
admission to the un recognition would conflate with acknowledgment of sovereignty. %$* 138
legally, that may not be the case, but that is the way it would be read. %$* 138
that is the way the palestinian authority would interpret it. %$* 138
and presumably, that is the way the international community might interpret it as well. %$* 138
and that, the notion that recognition and admission would create the mindset, the june 4, '67 borders have been established, have been laid down, would make it more difficult, even though, mustafa and daniel, it may well be the only rational, logical outcome is a negotiation with june 4, '67 borders as a basis. %$* 138
second, you have a divided palestinian polity. %$* 138
and let's not forget this point because it's fundamental to the entire argument. %$* 138
you're not dealing here with a negotiation which consists of one gun, one authority and one negotiating position. %$* 138
the notion that you would admit, as a member state, a divided palestinian polity, half of which has not even signed up to the conditions that are essentially, by definition, basic to a negotiation-- %$* 138
okay. %$* 13
let me bring in daniel-- %$* 13
you've made two-- %$* 13
it's critically important-- %$* 138
very strong, pragmatic arguments. %$* 13
levy. %$* 13
it's not-- %$* 138
it's not-- %$* 138
one more point, john. %$* 138
john, john, another-- %$* 138
one last point. %$* 138
it's not - - this notion of a division between what is morally acceptable, what is symbolic and what is pragmatic is a-- %$* 138
is a division without distinction. %$* 138
no one is doubting the fact that if the palestinians were admitted into the un, they would be more hopeful. %$* 138
no one is doubting that it would impress on the international community the notion of palestine as a sovereign state. %$* 138
what i am doubting, and what you have yet to demonstrate, is that such an act would bring us any closer to-- %$* 138
okay. %$* 13
meaningful sovereignty-- %$* 138
daniel-- %$* 13
aaron, i want to bring it to daniel because i want to come back to some of the points-- %$* 13
daniel levy. %$* 13
aaron, given that you've told us that it has to get worse before it gets worse and that the palestinians should join the reelect president obama campaign, i'm not sure-- %$* 597
and this isn't easy because it is probably obvious to everyone in this room. %$* 597
me and aaron aren't exactly hostile when it comes to one another. %$* 597
there's deep mutual appreciation, and i greatly respect the service that dore gold has given to the state of israel. %$* 597
i want to address the two points you put out there. %$* 597
first of all, what-- %$* 597
what we've tried to make the point of is that if you want a two-state solution, you have to do something about it, and you have to begin to anchor it, and you have to send signals. %$* 597
no one is expecting, the morning after admission of palestine to the un, palestine actually realizes its sovereignty. %$* 597
this isn't a standalone gesture. %$* 597
no, aaron, i'm going to-- %$* 597
i'm-- %$* 597
i'm not going to say a word. %$* 138
i'm not going to say a word. %$* 138
well, ultimately, you will. %$* 13
yeah, exactly. %$* 597
as for the expectation that, if it's admitted to the un, well, that means it's got full sovereignty. %$* 597
listen, for 40 plus years, the soviet socialist republic of belarus, and of ukraine, were members of the u.n. %$* 597
did that mean that they were independent states in the ussr? %$* 597
come on, this is a political act. %$* 597
what we're talking about here is sending a political signal from the u.n.your second point, the divided palestinian authority. %$* 597
first of all, aaron, you didn't get it exactly right in your description of who takes-- %$* 597
who assumes that palestinian seat at the u.n.it's not the palestinian authority, it's the plo, and that has been clarified and made clear. %$* 597
the plo is still headed by abbas. %$* 597
the plo has certain commitments that it has made in signed treaties. %$* 597
and i would look at this as i try and look at most things, to be honest, as how do we use this opportunity? %$* 597
how does this become an entry point to problem solving rather than rejecting it as another nonstop-- %$* 597
all right, let me come back to-- %$* 13
i want to finish the point. %$* 597
my entry point for this is a problem solver is i would turn around and say, "palestine, you're in the u.n., you sign the u.n. charter, read the words of the u.n. charter. %$* 597
hamas, you want reconciliation, you have to be signing up to the u.n. charter as well." i would make this part of the encouragement of internal palestinian unity, to see the opportunity, not a way to threat. %$* 597
dore gold. %$* 13
daniel levy mentions the u.n.charter. %$* 598
and, you know, one of the most important points in this discussion to keep in mind is-- %$* 598
sorry to be legal-- %$* 598
but article 4 of the charter, which says, "membership in the united nations is open to all other peace loving states which accept the obligation to continue the present charter," peace loving states. %$* 598
why is that important? %$* 598
mustafa barghouthi has invoked the names of martin luther king-- %$* 598
i don't know if he said "gandhi," but-- %$* 598
i said "gandhi" and "mandela." %$* 596
and mandela-- %$* 598
men who were against violence. %$* 598
if only we had them. %$* 138
exactly, if only-- %$* 598
i mean, palestinian political culture had adopted those positions, but-- %$* 598
frankly, frankly, just now, on december 22, in a meeting in cairo, and i'm not sure whether you were there or not-- %$* 598
i was. %$* 596
yes, okay. %$* 598
i don't want to get it personal, but there was a meeting of the palestinian leadership and it included khaled meshal, the head of hamas, it included the heads of islamic jihad, and these are organizations that call for the obliteration of the state of israel, the destruction of the state of israel. %$* 598
so how do you square the circle of invoking to an american audience names like martin luther king and then going to an event in cairo with the leaders of the islamic jihad which is a wing of the pasdaran of iran, of sitting with the hamas leadership while they-- %$* 598
after your meeting with them are quoted in al-hayat, in the arabic press, still calling for armed struggle against the state of israel? %$* 598
mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
i can't square the circle and you cannot have u.n. membership, you cannot have u.n. membership when you're coming to the u.n., when you're going to the secretary general-- %$* 598
all right, we take-- %$* 13
i can't just let you have the floor forever. %$* 13
we got your point and we want to keep the point moving. %$* 13
but you want to cut me off. %$* 598
thank you. %$* 13
mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
you know, dore, i want to ask you about the policy of israel. %$* 596
i asked you about the policy of the palestinians. %$* 598
i think-- %$* 596
and tell me about cairo. %$* 598
you were there-- %$* 598
i want to ask you about the fact that israel is the third largest-- %$* 596
no, mustafa, he-- %$* 13
no, no, give me the chance to speak here. %$* 596
israel is the third largest military exporter in the world. %$* 596
exporter? %$* 598
yes, israel is now-- %$* 596
has you know hundreds of nuclear heads. %$* 596
we all know that, so when you speak about peace and you speak about nonviolence, you might as well think of how israel itself should stop using violence. %$* 596
now, you said one of the arguments that were told here by mr. %$* 596
miller is that-- %$* 596
wait, wait, wait. %$* 13
the reason i'm intervening, there's a lot of scores being settled here. %$* 13
and we're traveling very far, and i'm not disregarding or disrespecting the passion about these issues, but we're trying to talk on the practicality or the morality either of this motion. %$* 13
and a very focused question was put to you-- %$* 13
but you've already-- %$* 13
you took the moment to take a slam at israel's record, fine. %$* 13
no, no, no, no. %$* 596
but there's a good point that he raised, and it's the same reason i'm interrupting you. %$* 13
there's a good point that i would like to hear the answer to, and i think the audience as well, if in fact-- %$* 13
it's very simple. %$* 13
if hamas is part of this state and the u.n. is an organization devoted to peace, can you please just bring those-- %$* 13
reconcile those two things. %$* 13
it’s a pretty obvious question. %$* 13
there are two major important developments that have happened thanks to our work, thanks to our advocacy of non-violence, which is that i know there are several statements and you could pick up the bad ones, but the official position now of hamas is to accept non-violence. %$* 596
this is a big achievement, and you should be happy about it. %$* 596
if people change positively, you should not get angry, as mr. %$* 596
gold does. %$* 596
also, they are accepting ’67 borders. %$* 596
that’s an important change. %$* 596
excuse me, can i make a point? %$* 598
and when we-- %$* 596
let him finish, yeah. %$* 13
when you speak about the palestinian authority being incapable of controlling security, of course, because it’s under occupation. %$* 596
we are the first people in the human history who are asked to provide protection to their occupiers without being able to defend themselves from the occupiers. %$* 596
that makes no sense. %$* 596
we are saying we are ready to have international troops standing on the borders, even inside the palestinian government state. %$* 596
we are ready to be totally demilitarized. %$* 596
we are, but we cannot provide security to anybody and even to ourselves if we are not independent. %$* 596
do you want to yield to aaron? %$* 13
why going to the u.n., why admission of the u.n will change the parameters for once the balance of power today is so much skewed in the interest of israel, and israel does what it wants. %$* 596
what we need to do is to change the balance of power. %$* 596
okay, so let me bring-- %$* 13
we’re engaged-- %$* 138
with all due respect, i-- %$* 138
aaron, can you come a little closer to the mic? %$* 13
with all due respect to iq2 u.s.-- %$* 138
i want to be invited back at some point-- %$* 138
we’re engaged in a kind of a thought experiment here. %$* 138
there’s a certain reality which we, once we leave this theater tonight, we’ll have to take account of there are only three ways that the palestinian state will be born. %$* 138
either the palestinians will take it from the israelis by force, which they are unable and i take you at your word, mustafa, unwilling to do. %$* 138
second, an international organization or body where the will of the international community will somehow deliver it to them on their behalf, but that is incredibly fanciful. %$* 138
the notion that admission into the u.n.will give you access to the icc, the international criminal court, the israelis will have their own case to be made against you. %$* 138
and, by the way-- %$* 138
what did you think of mustafa’s response to dore’s point, that in fact hamas has accepted 1967 borders and-- %$* 13
that in itself is a-- %$* 138
i have a tremendous respect for you, mustafa, but that is-- %$* 138
that strains the bounds of credulity to the breaking point-- %$* 138
by the way, and by the way, this is a political organization which may, in fact, be undergoing a transformation. %$* 138
it is going to have to find a new home because the arc on the assads is running south. %$* 138
no, what i’m saying to you is that if in fact there is a change, it is a process that will have to be demonstrated not in words and not in quiet conversation and not in cairo-- %$* 138
let’s bring in daniel levy. %$* 13
that is not-- %$* 138
that is not the main issue. %$* 138
i will come back to you. %$* 13
why are you afraid of change? %$* 596
mustafa, mustafa, i want to hear from your partner. %$* 13
and i’ll come back to dore. %$* 13
i know this is an issue in which people, you know, kind of skate in and out, don’t have very deeply held feelings. %$* 597
i think it’s a shame that we’ve descended into a blame game here, and i want to try and pick up on the thread that i think aaron was trying to reintroduce to the conversation. %$* 597
the palestinians can take this by force. %$* 597
they can have it delivered to them by the international community. %$* 597
and i’m guessing where you’re going with the third one is they can convince the israelis to actually withdraw. %$* 597
or at least that’s where i would go with it. %$* 597
and if you’re about to tell me that they can wait for america to deliver it for them, then i suggest you see a production of “waiting for godot.” no, the point i want to make is that i think what the israeli public needs to see right now, yes, there’s a continued-- %$* 597
there’s more of a palestinian commitment and are continued by those who are already there, commitment to living alongside israel, but i don’t think a charm offensive is the entirety of the ingredients that we have to bring into the mix. %$* 597
we have to bring in the ingredients which say to the israelis, “hey, i hope we’re moving away from violence, but we can’t sit on the sidelines while you swallow up all of palestine. %$* 597
so we're going to make declarative attempts. %$* 597
this does not mitigate against the fact that we want to live alongside you. %$* 597
we're not trying to replace you at the un.but we do have to begin to accumulate some beginnings of a balance of leverage, some addressing of this asymmetry. %$* 597
i think that's productive for any future israeli-palestinian process. %$* 597
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
i'm going to come to the audience for questions in a moment. %$* 13
dore gold has been very patient waiting through two rounds for a chance to respond. %$* 13
well, one of the purposes-- %$* 598
dore gold. %$* 13
one of the purposes of this discussion-- %$* 598
we're in an academic setting. %$* 598
academic setting means we have to distill what the truth is about certain situations. %$* 598
and we have to report the facts. %$* 598
and it is interesting to share those facts when you come from cairo, or i come from jerusalem. %$* 598
and unfortunately, there is the fact that five days after your meeting in cairo, hamas, on its official website, palestine-info.info, hamas made the following statement. %$* 598
"we underline our adherence to our right to the struggle in all its forms, particularly the armed struggle." that's not martin luther king. %$* 598
sorry. %$* 598
and if i can just finish the sentence, it's not the un charter which is our subject for tonight. %$* 598
and you can't embellish this. %$* 598
you can't somehow treat it as though it's not there, because you're asking these people to vote for admission of palestine to the un. if palestine involves arms struggle, are you prepared to vote for arms struggle against my people, the people of israel? %$* 598
i can quote here-- %$* 596
mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
many israelis, including rabbis and mr. %$* 596
lieberman, your foreign minister, who described palestinians as crushers but i'm not going to do that. %$* 596
i-- %$* 596
i-- %$* 596
hamas. %$* 598
there is some guy on the fringe of hamas-- %$* 598
sorry, sorry. %$* 597
so avigdor lieberman is some guy on the fringe of israeli politics? %$* 597
on the same day that israeli negotiators sat with palestinian negotiators in amman, this week, last week, foreign minister lieberman said, this isn't going anywhere. %$* 597
there's not going to be a palestinian state. %$* 597
the likud platform says the government-- %$* 597
excuse me, daniel levy. %$* 598
daniel levy. %$* 598
dore, let him finish. %$* 13
i'm against the establishment of palestinian-arab state. %$* 597
i'm against hamas' position. %$* 597
but this is not coming from one side-- %$* 597
daniel levy, that's called moral equivalents, daniel levy. %$* 598
oh, don't throw moral equivalents at me. %$* 597
yes, it is. %$* 598
because-- %$* 598
what delegitimizes israel, which we don't the border-- %$* 597
daniel levy, you can't-- %$* 598
what delegitimizes israel is when-- %$* 597
daniel levy, you cannot-- %$* 598
is when they maintain an occupation. %$* 597
all right. %$* 13
you cannot compare-- %$* 598
passions are running high %$* 13
debate is robust. %$* 13
i'd like to go to audience questions please. %$* 13
foreign minister lieberman did not call for murder, so don't put him in the same box as hamas. %$* 598
all right. %$* 13
you're wrong. %$* 597
you cannot-- %$* 597
what undermines the state of israel is your continued settlement project. %$* 597
daniel? %$* 13
you think settlements are not a big deal. %$* 597
the settlements are the death knell, the death knell of israeli democracy. %$* 597
nobody is killing anybody. %$* 598
i'm talking about our struggle. %$* 598
but the settlements aren’t backed by the israeli military. %$* 597
the settlements exist in some kind of bubble, esoteric world of-- %$* 597
come on. %$* 597
the real world. %$* 597
who defends the settlements? %$* 597
the tooth fairy? %$* 597
i'm really sorry for mr. %$* 596
gold because you are really advocating the creation of apartheid. %$* 596
and that means killing the two-state option. %$* 596
you know, you know, what we aspire to here, and we just went to an episode of not doing it-- %$* 13
is actually to shed light by arguing relevant facts. %$* 13
and all of these facts may be relevant to the larger argument. %$* 13
we're talking about the practicality or the morality of this motion. %$* 13
and we can talk about cairo and who was at the meeting. %$* 13
and we got that point the very first time. %$* 13
and we can-- %$* 13
we know that israel has a record that is offensive to the palestinians. %$* 13
and we got that the first time. %$* 13
we would really ask you all to try to bring this level up to-- %$* 13
and i do think settlements are completely relevant, and you made that point well. %$* 13
but we would like to ask you to bring this up to a level of keeping this on the facts that are happening here. %$* 13
now i'm going to the questions. %$* 13
and i'm-- %$* 13
i'm-- %$* 13
i'm counting on you folks to hear what i just said. %$* 13
so again, i urge to you really try to focus it as a question. %$* 13
keep it on this point. %$* 13
we cannot argue every point of history back to 1948 and before. %$* 13
and we're trying to understand-- %$* 13
we're trying to understand what will happen if this motion were to pass or if this motion were not to pass. %$* 13
sir, and you're wearing a pink shirt on the far right. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
i'd like to ask mr. %$* 18
barghouthi a question. %$* 18
two brief questions, one is-- %$* 18
i'd like to just ask one. %$* 13
pick one. %$* 13
well, they're so fast, it's going to be less than-- %$* 18
just pick one. %$* 13
i want him to answer one. %$* 13
well, okay. %$* 18
one is there was a 10-month settlement freeze and the palestinians, there's no movement on the part of the palestinians. %$* 18
and two is, in '47-- %$* 18
i'm sorry. %$* 18
all right. %$* 13
how is that-- %$* 13
sir, how does that relate to our motion directly? %$* 13
to a motion. %$* 18
it's a question about what he was talking about. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
thank you, i'm going to go on to another question. %$* 13
we're trying to stay on the topic of this motion. %$* 13
with respect. %$* 13
ma'am, right in the center. %$* 13
so staying away from the question of whether it should be a two-state solution, but going back into the argument before. %$* 19
what do you feel is the impact of passing a palestine into the un? %$* 19
how does it impact the actual negotiation process? %$* 19
so going back to what would actually-- %$* 19
i think dore gold said it would be-- %$* 13
take two steps back-- %$* 19
it would kill it. %$* 13
didn't-- %$* 13
did dore gold not argue that it would be very detrimental to negotiations-- %$* 13
but i want to-- %$* 19
i want to understand from the side that's arguing for, how do you actually deal with-- %$* 19
i mean, are you undermining negotiations by prematurely entering into this position. %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
let's let mustafa barghouthi take that question. %$* 13
i have two questions. %$* 596
the first is about the 10-month settlements. %$* 596
the 10-month settlement to me, it's-- %$* 596
actually, there was no freeze, because it did not include jerusalem. %$* 596
it did not include what they call “natural growth.” so there wasn't freeze. %$* 596
and palestinians are trying their best, although i would agree with the tactics. %$* 596
but yesterday-- %$* 596
mustafa, this audience is going to vote on what you said about the motion tonight. %$* 13
she asked a direct question about-- %$* 13
about the motion. %$* 13
if you could tell-- %$* 13
about the motion, yes. %$* 596
the second question is about the motion. %$* 596
and i want to say here that if we are admitted to the un, the most important thing that will come out is that the illegal actions of settlements which are destroying the possibility of a two-state solution would be invalid. %$* 596
that means de facto creation of settlements on the ground does not undermine the right of the palestinians to have a state. %$* 596
that will be good for peace and for two-state solution. %$* 596
aaron david miller, do you have a response to that? %$* 13
it's a very interesting answer. %$* 13
well, i think it-- %$* 138
but could you come a little closer? %$* 13
with all due respect, i think that exists in the level again of a thought experiment. %$* 138
it doesn't. %$* 596
it is-- %$* 138
admission to the un will not stop israeli settlement activity. %$* 138
i would argue actually it's going to accelerate it. %$* 138
and it will allow the israelis to make it unmistakably clear to the americans, who will, in fact, take their part in this, in large part because we - - %$* 138
mustafa's point is not-- %$* 13
not that the palestinians would have more legal standing to resist. %$* 13
the legal standing to do what? %$* 138
the day after you are admitted-- %$* 138
the fact-- %$* 596
mustafa, let me finish. %$* 138
on the ground will not become fact-- %$* 596
mustafa, let me finish. %$* 138
the day after you are admitted into the un, nothing will change. %$* 138
and arguably-- %$* 138
and we've been arguing about it. %$* 138
nothing is going to change because neither-- %$* 138
you need two powers to support and make sovereignty meaningful to you. %$* 138
you may have given up on them. %$* 138
you may have convinced yourselves that their administrations are bankrupt, and they may offer you no hope. %$* 138
but it is a reality that unless you can take what you want by force, unless the international community is going to give it to you, which they will not. %$* 138
they will not. %$* 138
they have the iranians, they have the syrians. %$* 138
people are standing in line to sanction well ahead of what the international community would do with respect to the israelis. %$* 138
your ultimate objective is to create-- %$* 138
and i would agree with daniel-- %$* 138
a different constellation of forces to support a negotiation, to end the conflict. %$* 138
but you cannot create that improved balance by seeking admission into the un.it will not improve your standing. %$* 138
and i have heard nothing in the last hour-- %$* 138
all right. %$* 13
daniel-- %$* 13
daniel, do you have-- %$* 13
to suggest that it will. %$* 138
do you have something new to say to him? %$* 13
but before that, one second, please. %$* 596
i didn't say that admission to the un is the only factor that will change the balance. %$* 596
i said this is part of a bigger thing which is popular, nonviolent resistance. %$* 596
it's diplomatic resistance within the context of something bigger. %$* 596
this will change parameters. %$* 596
but you'll get the-- %$* 138
daniel levy. %$* 13
you'll get the opposite reaction. %$* 138
aaron, let me let daniel levy, because i didn't hear from him. %$* 13
two responses, aaron. %$* 597
first, i really beg to differ with you on what looks different the morning after palestine's admitted to the un. %$* 597
in the following way, and this isn't just about prime minister netanyahu and his coalition, but i do think that when prime minister netanyahu can strut his stuff and say, "you see, the international community doesn't admit palestine to the u.n.," i think that sends precisely the wrong signal to the israeli public. %$* 597
i give credit to the israeli public intelligence in knowing the cost benefit calculation of the signals they're receiving are not affirmative enough yet regarding two states, and i think it's that signal that matters, and i do think it's not going to change everything but it would change something in the discourse if palestine is admitted to the u.n. and that's the kind of change that we need to begin to see happening. %$* 597
all right. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing out this motion, "the u.n. should admit palestine as a full member state."and on to another question, yeah, you're very enthusiastic and you've got a red sweater. %$* 13
you asked for questions that would eliminate a good discussion here. %$* 19
could you please define to me who are the palestinians? %$* 19
whom are we negotiating with? %$* 19
wait, wait. %$* 13
i'm going to let you elaborate. %$* 13
i want to-- %$* 13
i want to know what you're-- %$* 13
i can't elaborate. %$* 19
i am sincerely asking. %$* 19
so you're saying the plo, the pa, the hamas, are you confused or what? %$* 13
yes, i don't-- %$* 19
i do not have a sense of a nation of people that are properly represented to have negotiations to make-- %$* 19
all right. %$* 13
i'd like mustafa barghouthi to take this. %$* 13
there was once an israeli prime minister by the name of golda meir. %$* 596
she said, "who are the palestinians? %$* 596
they don't exist." well, since then, israel has been fighting with a non-existing people. %$* 596
and i feel-- %$* 596
i'm so sorry that you think-- %$* 596
that you were nonviolent. %$* 18
i'm so sorry that you think this way, ma'am, because denying the presence of people is nothing but a reflection of racism. %$* 596
we are there. %$* 596
we are there. %$* 596
we have our history. %$* 596
we're 11 million people. %$* 596
six million of us are in the diaspora. %$* 596
you know what would surprise you most is how much palestinians are similar to the jewish people. %$* 596
the suffering you had, we have and we will get there one day. %$* 596
and you and us would be happy-- %$* 596
i just have to ask you, what is the premise of your question, the golda meier, "palestinians don't exist" thought, is that what you were-- %$* 13
no, i am-- %$* 19
take the mic back. %$* 13
that's why i asked for clarification. %$* 13
are you saying there's simply a splinter-- %$* 13
i would like to have a-- %$* 19
some kind of a description of whom are we talking about that we are negotiating with or not negotiating with, what is the entity that we can actually work with? %$* 19
what is the actual-- %$* 19
daniel levy, do you want to take a very quick run at this? %$* 13
well, israel signs agreements with the plo or the agreements that prime minister netanyahu signed that were referred to earlier, those are signed with the plo, the palestinian liberation organization. %$* 597
there's negotiation right now as to whether on the conditions under which hamas and other bodies will join the plo.they're not in the plo at the moment. %$* 597
the pnc is in the plo. every member of the palestinian parliament, which means the gentleman sitting next to me is included in the plo, that's who israel-- %$* 597
okay, let's move on to another question. %$* 13
sir, in the very center, dark sweater, you have-- %$* 13
wait for a microphone and please ask a question. %$* 13
and, by the way, ma'am, that was a question, and it was tightly focused, formally perfect. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 18
uh oh. %$* 13
male speaker solid answer, i am a third party here. %$* 13
i heard this side. %$* 13
i heard this side. %$* 13
special like me, he mentioned about peaceful nation under article number 4. %$* 13
i need you to get to a question in the next two sentences. %$* 13
so that is-- %$* 18
the question is whether palestine is qualified to be a peaceful nation or not. %$* 18
the situation tells now that they don't. %$* 18
and my comments on that are that they should be given another 100 years to go through the training and be a peaceful nation. %$* 18
okay, i don’t think you’re going to get any argument from-- %$* 13
maybe from this side. %$* 13
and we’ve heard the response already because this side has made that argument, so i want to move on, ma’am. %$* 13
ma’am, right there. %$* 13
yeah, yeah, you just pointed to yourself. %$* 13
oh, i’m sorry. %$* 13
i’m not sure whether there is a mic is on this side. %$* 13
it’s going to come-- %$* 13
right on the edge there-- %$* 13
no. %$* 13
yeah, that’s it, that’s it, that’s it. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
hi. %$* 13
i think there are about 133 u.n.security council resolutions against israel or something like that. %$* 19
no? %$* 19
i think you-- %$* 597
how many u.n.-- %$* 19
general council with other u.n. bodies. %$* 597
okay, well, how many u.n. resolutions have-- %$* 19
there are 41 u.n. vetoes against resolutions in the security council. %$* 597
well, i wanted to know how many u.n. resolutions israel has formally rejected against it and why, if it rejected those, it suddenly sees the viability of u.n. decisions in this case? %$* 19
but it won’t. %$* 13
so i’m going to move onto another question. %$* 13
ma’am, in the far left-- %$* 13
you’re right at the last seat against the wall, yeah. %$* 13
no, with respect, sorry. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
thank you. %$* 19
i wanted to address this to daniel levy. %$* 19
the point that mr. %$* 19
miller made about that how can they control the guns, you’re saying that the plo will be the one to take the seat at the u.n.council. %$* 19
how will they then control the guns if there’s division within the palestinian people? %$* 19
you mean, how will they control the guns in gaza? %$* 13
right. %$* 19
daniel levy. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 597
i mean, as i’ve said, i think there are two ways of coming at this. %$* 597
first of all, call me curmudgeonly pessimist, but i don’t think the morning after palestine’s admitted to the u.n., israel is going to say, “ah, game’s up. %$* 597
we’re withdrawing to the ’67 lines now.”so, in practical terms, you know, i believe that this is about what signals do we send, even as an academic exercise. %$* 597
so in practical terms, i think it’s a crucial question, but it’s not the morning after we all vote tonight or you all vote tonight or palestine is admitted to the u.n. what i do think is-- %$* 597
and you know, let’s be creative diplomatically here-- %$* 597
what i do think is you should be encouraging realistic terms for palestinian reconciliation, for one authority with one gun. %$* 597
and i think part of the blend of how you do that could be using the very admission of palestine to the u.n., the very signing of that u.n.charter to hold hamas to a certain standard on violence. %$* 597
personally, i think, the-- %$* 597
dore gold, do you think that would happen? %$* 13
condition were not a good idea. %$* 597
the violence one was. %$* 597
dore gold, do you think that’s what would happen? %$* 13
unfortunately, hamas, and this is hard for us to understand this in the west, is a rigidly ideological organization. %$* 598
you know, in 2006, hamas won the palestinian election, not just in gaza strip but also in the west bank. %$* 598
and mahmoud al-zahar, who would become the hamas foreign minister, was asked by a western correspondent, “are you willing to change the hamas charter from 1988, which, by the way, does not call just for the destruction of israel. %$* 598
it calls for the murder of jews. %$* 598
it’s a genocidal document, and i have to use that language because that’s what it is. %$* 598
and do you know how al-zahar responded in 2006? %$* 598
not a single word. %$* 598
and many of us thought, you know, british gas has found huge gas deposits offshore in the mediterranean next to the gaza strip. %$* 598
they want to have commerce with the eu, with the world. %$* 598
they’ll change. %$* 598

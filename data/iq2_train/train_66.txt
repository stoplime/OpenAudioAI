so is the whole culture change in millennials just getting the-- %$* 262
getting the biggest change? %$* 262
and i think that's probably what's going on. %$* 262
it's very hard to tease that apart with the data we have because most of the data we have come from college students, this historical data. %$* 262
right down front here. %$* 13
by the way, thanks for that. %$* 13
that was a good question. %$* 13
it was really thank you for asking it. %$* 13
actually, it's good you picked me because this is a very similar question, although it's related, and it's for keith as well. %$* 19
like a good millennial, i'm pulling up statistics on my phone, and that was during the whole debate, and i ask this somewhat of a self-involved intention, since i'm writing my master's thesis on the subject. %$* 19
there are-- %$* 19
and you like to share too, don't you? %$* 13
i do. %$* 19
i do. %$* 19
there are a lot of studies out there that talk about how special media and instagram activity brings envy and feelings of jealousy. %$* 19
and do you think this kind of competition is breeding this generation of millennial overachievers? %$* 19
and don't you think that's a good thing and will help millennials to succeed? %$* 19
another trick question. %$* 13
that's a good one. %$* 13
keith. %$* 13
there's some research saying that when you spend too much time on facebook you get sad because you look at everybody posting their wonderful life, and you compare it to your life that isn't quite as wonderful. %$* 262
so there's a little bit on that. %$* 262
would that help you succeed? %$* 262
i mean, i don't know. %$* 262
i think it would make you sad. %$* 262
i'd like to get some questions for this side. %$* 13
does anybody have a question for this side, and i'll vary it, man right in the center there, yeah. %$* 13
the mic's going to come from your right side. %$* 13
hi, my name's charlotte. %$* 19
this is for david. %$* 19
i'm just curious about thinking about social media with kind of political purposes. %$* 19
clay shirky, he's a new media expert, and he wrote the book, "here comes everybody," and he's interested in exploring how social media can be used for grassroots activism. %$* 19
and a lot of the talk tonight has been sort of about individual uses of social media for narcissistic purposes. %$* 19
and i'm just kind of curious as to kind of the benefits of millennial social media activity for-- %$* 19
again, again, i find it an interesting question, but how will it help you vote at the end of the evening, your question about what the generation is doing? %$* 13
but you can rephrase it to that. %$* 13
i would love to have the question from-- %$* 13
are millennials engaging in social media activity for political ends as opposed to just narcissistic ones? %$* 19
in a word, "yes," and, in fact, it's actually one of the great accomplishments i think of this generation. %$* 263
i mean, this is a generation of people who without whom it would have been-- %$* 263
it's very difficult to imagine our current president in the white house. %$* 263
and if you want to-- %$* 263
regardless of how you feel about the president, that doesn't matter. %$* 263
i mean, this sense that this is a generation of people who said that they supported somebody and were able to organize and turn out in incredible numbers on behalf of that. %$* 263
so when you look at this, this is a generation that by 2020 will be a third of the electorate. %$* 263
and they have shown an ability to care about politics, to get engaged in politics, and not-- %$* 263
and it's not just particularly on candidates. %$* 263
i mean, you look at sopa and pipa and what this generation did with-- %$* 263
aided by technology companies, be able to work on those things. %$* 263
you look at the arab spring, internationally. %$* 263
you look at all these things where this generation is uniquely positioned to organized in a way that people of other generations are not really prepared to respond to. %$* 263
you look at just last week, ceo of mozilla was routed out of their job in large part by millennials who didn't agree with his stance on gay marriage. %$* 263
so there's a incredible advantage that millennials have when it comes to social media, particularly in political-- %$* 263
politics and activism, because we have an understanding of that landscape as digital natives that immigrants don't particularly understand as well. %$* 263
you mean "immigrants" being everybody over 35. %$* 13
yes, exactly. %$* 18
yeah. %$* 13
i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer session of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
i have four debaters here on the stage with me, two teams of two, debating this motion, "millennials don't stand a chance.” keith, did you want to respond to what-- %$* 13
yeah, i mean, i-- %$* 262
social media, like fire, you can use it for good or bad. %$* 262
the two points i'd make sort of in opposition to that is "kony 2011"-- %$* 262
what was "kony? %$* 262
" the greatest movie of all time that people are now writing dissertations on. %$* 262
they have master’s on what they call "collectivism" or "selectivism," where people are willing to like a lot of things but don't really act. %$* 262
and in terms of the obama campaign, i don't know if that was grassroots millennials doing that or if that was a bunch of gen x behavioral economists figuring out how to manipulate millennials into voting. %$* 262
i mean, i think there's-- %$* 262
different opportunities, but that-- %$* 262
wow, you are really assaulting the basic myth here. %$* 13
i'm just saying i know some of them. %$* 262
you know, i-- %$* 13
generation. %$* 19
sorry, go ahead? %$* 13
can i respond to that? %$* 263
yes, please-- %$* 13
i mean, i just-- %$* 262
sorry. %$* 262
i can't really let that go. %$* 262
i mean, i think first of all, i mean, this notion of collectivism and selectivism is one i really have to push back on. %$* 262
all right, define it. %$* 13
so "collectivism" is essentially this idea that all people are doing is clicking on things and they don't really care about anything. %$* 263
so people are liking a facebook post and they think, "here is this great thing i've done for the world by clicking a button on this thing, and now i've done all i have to do to care about the world for today," or, "this week," or, "this year, and now i'm going to go home," i think it's a-- %$* 263
i mean, people are laughing as i'm saying this, it's kind of a ridiculous idea. %$* 263
sure a lot of people watched that "kony 2012" video-- %$* 263
why did they watch it? %$* 263
people didn't think they were doing an act of heroism by watching that video, but i tell you one thing, more people in this generation know about an african warlord than previous generations knew and what he's doing and the human rights abuses he's carrying out. %$* 263
so i think when you think about the fact that more people in this generation have awareness about the rest of the world and the problems in the world and have some level of engagement, everything we know about human behavior and how people evolve over time suggests that if you get engaged with a global issue, have one smidge of awareness, or you donate to something when you're younger, the chances that over the long term that behavior is never going to manifest ever again, that would defy everything we know about human behavior and how people develop. %$* 263
binta, you look like you want to respond to this one. %$* 13
i mean, kony is such a funny example, because aside from the fact that-- %$* 261
again, remind listeners and audience members what kony was. %$* 13
you know, i don't remember all the-- %$* 261
all right. %$* 13
i will. %$* 13
details. %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
do you want to? %$* 261
yeah. %$* 13
kony was a film made by some american activists who had gone out-- %$* 13
a non-profit. %$* 261
a non-profit who had gone out and been upset by a years-long ravaging of the countryside in uganda, correct? %$* 13
right. %$* 261
and by a warlord. %$* 13
and he went and made a film about in 2011, 2012, in april, and put it up online. %$* 13
and it caused-- %$* 13
an announced there was going to be a day of action. %$* 13
and it caused an enormous stir among primarily younger generations, including my 10-year- old daughter, which is why i know about it. %$* 13
they were talking about it at breakfast. %$* 13
they were talking about it at dinner. %$* 13
they were outraged. %$* 13
they-- %$* 13
and it's true. %$* 13
they had never paid any attention whatsoever to africa. %$* 13
and then the day came. %$* 13
and it was a little bit of a bust, partly because of a little bit of some personal problems with the director-- %$* 13
right. %$* 261
of the film. %$* 13
i mean, the day was a bit of a bust, in part, of his personal issues. %$* 261
but it was also a bit of a bust because the issue had largely resolved itself before the video came out. %$* 261
and it was also a bust because there was a very large percentage of people in uganda and throughout the african continent who were extraordinarily offended by that video. %$* 261
you know, it was a video that was done without having a lot of close interaction. %$* 261
i mean, we talk about, you know, social media and technology and the different ways of %$* 261
so, that goes to naivete. %$* 13
right. %$* 261
i think you're saying-- %$* 13
of the millennial generation. %$* 13
of one social media work to actually make change in this country? %$* 264
yes. %$* 13
but what you address you do-- %$* 13
the question-- %$* 13
the point that binta made, that there was a naivete-- %$* 13
sure. %$* 264
in your generation-- %$* 13
but i think that-- %$* 264
of optimism-- %$* 13
you know, in the sixties, i think there was a great naivete in a lot of the activists that were-- %$* 264
i mean-- %$* 264
well-- %$* 13
these activists are %$* 264
well-landed. %$* 13
jessica grose. %$* 13
youth activists are often deeply naïve. %$* 264
i mean, so, the two examples off the top of my head. %$* 264
one was when susan g. komen for the cure, the breast cancer organization, stopped-- %$* 264
went against planned parenthood and wasn't giving money to planned parenthood anymore. %$* 264
there was a huge uproar. %$* 264
and it basically-- %$* 264
i mean, the ceo was ousted. %$* 264
it completely ruined the-- %$* 264
it didn't ruin the organization. %$* 264
but it gave them a really hard time. %$* 264
and it got a lot more people aware. %$* 264
and not just of breast cancer-- %$* 264
which it did. %$* 264
but also about planned parenthood and the work it does. %$* 264
and another-- %$* 264
i write a lot about women's issues. %$* 264
so, the other thing was wendy davis and her stand in texas, and how quickly that circulated around the internet and made people aware of the issues about abortion rights in texas. %$* 264
and then a swarm of mostly millennial women stormed the texas statehouse because they were so-- %$* 264
ultimately it didn't work out, you know? %$* 264
the elected officials in texas are largely republican, and they did end up passing that anti-choice bill. %$* 264
but still, like, there was just this ground swell of support and activism that did not just raise awareness, but i think could be argued, made change. %$* 264
so, i think it's not just clicking on something. %$* 264
people are getting enraged and making action and voting, you know? %$* 264
young women really care about these issues, and they are constantly aware of them. %$* 264
do we have any questions? %$* 13
and i mean this sincerely, because i haven't seen any hands go up-- %$* 13
of anyone over the age of 35? %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
do not be afraid. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
i remember angela davis, and she made a great difference. %$* 18
this is for david, who started to explain it-- %$* 18
your generation came into one of the greatest recessions that the united states has ever faced. %$* 18
and when i was invited here tonight, i was asked-- %$* 18
i asked whether this was an internal or external debate, whether we were talking about sociological problems-- %$* 18
sir, just in the interest of time, i need you to zero in on your question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
so, what generation of americans got dealt a worse hand than the millennials? %$* 18
in world war ii, we fought together. %$* 18
and that bonded us together and we-- %$* 18
but is that your question? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 18
what generation-- %$* 13
what-- %$* 18
if we're talk-- %$* 18
we're dividing society into generations, what generation got dealt a worse hand than you? %$* 18
well-- %$* 263
the labor movement is dead. %$* 18
the greatest transfer of wealth in the united states has happened since 1980 upward to the-- %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
that sounds like the answer. %$* 13
david, why don't you answer the question? %$* 13
well, i mean-- %$* 263
david burstein. %$* 13
the-- %$* 263
a big part of that is the generation that went through the great depression. %$* 263
i mean, the fact that those people, through that period of time, there was a sense-- %$* 263
people had no idea when the depression might end. %$* 263
you look at the reality of that. %$* 263
my grandmother still thinks that when i call long-distance, it's expensive. %$* 263
and so, urges me to hang up as quickly as possible. %$* 263
so, i think that there is a long-lasting impact there which, interestingly, you're not seeing among millennials, right? %$* 263
so this idea that-- %$* 263
that we have had this-- %$* 263
this goes to back to what we were talking about earlier-- %$* 263
this sense of resilience i think is really, really important. %$* 263
so there have been-- %$* 263
you know,-- %$* 263
that generation was certainly, in recent history, in this century, i would say that generation was certainly in recent history. %$* 263
david, there's one part of your argument-- %$* 13
of your answer there, and it's come up a few times, is that i don't feel you've ever truly addressed binta's point that while your optimism is real and is authentic, that it's happened again and again and again in time. %$* 13
and that in time that optimism burns out. %$* 13
and you, i believe, are arguing-- %$* 13
and jessica - - are arguing that, no, it's different with us this time. %$* 13
are you actually arguing that? %$* 13
i'm not arguing that. %$* 264
you're not. %$* 13
i'm just arguing that we're not-- %$* 264
the proposition is that we're doomed. %$* 264
i don't think we're doomed. %$* 264
i don't think that we're anything special, but it's just, you know, we have a lot of skills. %$* 264
and one that we haven't talked about before is that we are native to the technology, which is is to use a lame silicone valley word, "disrupting" the world. %$* 264
and we understand those technologies much more deeply than the older generations, and we are able to harness those technologies. %$* 264
and i think that's that not even been addressed. %$* 264
binta, you think that's not true? %$* 13
i think that that's so unfair. %$* 261
i mean, generation x was known as the computer generation. %$* 261
it is also known as the digital generation. %$* 261
when i was 12 years old, i was playing on things called "bulletin boards" which was an early version of the internet. %$* 261
i wrote my senior thesis in 1995 on the internet and all of the different ways it's going to change society. %$* 261
we're not talking about internet use. %$* 263
well, hang on-- %$* 261
hang on. %$* 261
hang on. %$* 261
the companies that you're talking about that make you digital natives, right, were all founded by, for the most part, with the exception of facebook, were by and large founded by people in generation x. it's simply inaccurate every time somebody says that the millennial generation is the only generation-- %$* 261
okay. %$* 13
that gets to %$* 261
i'm interested in david's outburst. %$* 13
when you said we're not talking about internet use, what are you talking about? %$* 13
i mean, the question-- %$* 263
i alluded to this earlier, this question of nativism versus immigrantism, right? %$* 263
so this idea that you-- %$* 263
if you understand a technology-- %$* 263
enabling in your upbringing, that it actually positions you over the long term to use it more effectively, not just to create companies. %$* 263
that's just a piece of it. %$* 263
and, you know, yes, facebook, google, you know, twitter are big companies, and some of the founders of twitter-- %$* 263
there's a long debate on who actually founded twitter-- %$* 263
were people who were-- %$* 263
who were millennials. %$* 263
and you also look at the people who are the kinds of companies that are coming out today, whether it's a company-- %$* 263
so why does that make it different? %$* 13
why does that-- %$* 13
well, i would say there's been a democratization of technology. %$* 264
that-- %$* 264
that's true. %$* 261
the majority of millennials grew up with it whereas, gen x, it was a very privileged thing for them to grow up and have, you know, internet in the home. %$* 264
like the numbers have just skyrocketed.so i think it's different in that way. %$* 264
98 percent of people in this generation have regular access to the internet. %$* 263
okay, binta. %$* 13
okay. %$* 261
so when you create something, i would submit to you that you have a pretty good understanding as to how to use it. %$* 261
and at the same time that your generation was becoming used to using these technologies, older generations have also become used to using these technologies. %$* 261
now, the boomers, maybe they were a little bit slower, and the greatest generation-- %$* 261
i mean, i don't know what they do. %$* 261
but they're silent. %$* 261
they're silent, right? %$* 261
but i just think that it's a little bit misleading, right? %$* 261
there's a difference between-- %$* 261
you know, we oftentimes talk about millennials and being digital savvy. %$* 261
having the ability to make a facebook post or to take a selfie or to snapchat or to engage on whatsapp is not digital savvy. %$* 261
having the ability to create the button is digital savvy. %$* 261
right. %$* 264
and more of them know how to code than people in generation x. %$* 264
i'm not sure that that's actually accurate. %$* 261
and that concludes round two of this intelligence squared u.s. debate. %$* 13
where our motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” and now we move on to round three. %$* 13
round three are brief closing statements from each debater in turn to summarize their positions. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
the motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, to say that millennials don't stand a chance, w.keith campbell. %$* 13
he is professor of psychology at the university of georgia and author of "the narcissism epidemic." %$* 13
thank you. %$* 262
i don't have any prepared remarks here. %$* 262
i'm just going to wing it based on the last conversation. %$* 262
like a millennial. %$* 261
and-- %$* 262
like a millennial. %$* 262
no. %$* 262
that's-- %$* 262
don't even have millennial jokes. %$* 262
so often what i-- %$* 262
often when i think about things, i think, what do i tell my students, and what do i want for my children who are going to be the next generation? %$* 262
and i'm scared. %$* 262
i mean, i'm scared for the future they have maybe because i lack optimism or maybe because i'm realistic. %$* 262
i don't know. %$* 262
you can decide. %$* 262
i tell my students, figure out something to do that they can't do in china and that a robot or ai won't be able to do in five or ten years, because that's what's going to happen to a lot of the jobs. %$* 262
i tell my-- %$* 262
grad students to learn how to code, to learn really sophisticated statistics so they can maybe get a job because they're the only one who can do it, and so they're not underemployed in the service industry. %$* 262
and i hope to god my daughter becomes a physician so, you know, if things get really bad, they'll keep her alive to care for the young. %$* 262
so i-- %$* 262
so i think i'm truly negative about things. %$* 262
does that mean it can't change? %$* 262
well, maybe. %$* 262
but it should have changed. %$* 262
we've had eight years of collapse. %$* 262
people should have done something. %$* 262
and what we decided to do is give a whole lot of money to bankers, which is great for new york when i looked around. %$* 262
but we haven't done anything so far. %$* 262
and so to me, that doesn't sound like we're going to do anything in the future. %$* 262
you have my time. %$* 262
thank you. %$* 262
i don't have any prepared remarks here. %$* 262
i'm just going to wing it based on the last conversation. %$* 262
thank you, keith campbell. %$* 13
our motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” and here to summarize her position against the motion, jessica grose. %$* 13
she's a contributor to bloomberg business week and slate, and she's author of the novel "sad desk salad.” ladies and gentlemen, jessica grose. %$* 13
so the people on this panel all seem to have very short historical memories. %$* 264
we don't seem to have discussed anything before 1930, so i'd like to do that now. %$* 264
if you looked at income inequality in the gilded age, in the late 19th century and the early-- %$* 264
and the turn of the century, it was even worse than it is now. %$* 264
opportunity-- %$* 264
class movement was even lower than it is now. %$* 264
poverty was endemic, and it was much-- %$* 264
it is worse than it is now. %$* 264
and i am sure there are newspaper columnists writing in 1870 that the gen-- %$* 264
the millennial, the horse millennials, or whatever they were calling the buggy riders, whatever they were calling them in 1870, were uniquely doomed. %$* 264
so i just think that a lot of the way we frame millennials is based on a period of prosperity in the '60s, which was, in and of itself, the anomaly in american history. %$* 264
and that's when we talk about marriage, when we talk about children, the age at first marriage in the 1910s and 1920s was in the late-- %$* 264
was, you know, 28 or 29.it was similar to how it is today. %$* 264
so i think we have this warped perspective of, you know, what's facing millennials and how we can-- %$* 264
and then how we can face those problems. %$* 264
we are a fine generation. %$* 264
we are as fine a generation as a group of 20 million people can be compared to an aggregate of 20 million other people. %$* 264
so i would really urge you to urge against the idea that we are specifically doomed, especially when compared to the generations, centuries of generations that have come before us. %$* 264
thank you, jessica grose. %$* 13
our motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” and here to summarize her position supporting this motion, binta niambi brown. %$* 13
she is a corporate tech lawyer, startup adviser and human rights advocate. %$* 13
so i have a confession to make. %$* 261
last night while i was watching a video on my ipad and exchanging texts with mentees, friends and my mother, and doing some work for a startup i advise, and preparing for this evening, i took the pew foundation, "are you a millennial? %$* 261
" quiz. %$* 261
and i scored an 80, which means that i share more traits with the millennials, actually, than with my own generation, the forgotten generation, the x'ers. %$* 261
i'm not surprised by this. %$* 261
i spend a lot of time with millennials. %$* 261
my parents are baby boomers. %$* 261
and i really, really like my parents a lot. %$* 261
so it may seem like tonight i'm arguing against myself, except that i'm not because of the accident of my birth. %$* 261
the fact that i was born 8 to 15 years before the beginning of the millennial generation means that the kinds of reckless policies that have been delimiting life chances for millennials today have not taken root and have not had a substantial impact on my prospective outcome. %$* 261
things for millennials are not good. %$* 261
we've let this generation down. %$* 261
we've handed them a bad deal. %$* 261
it's because of our shortsightedness that we have a world with a number of structural and systemic problems that dramatically decrease the likelihood of their life chances. %$* 261
our education system is failing, our entitlement system is broken. %$* 261
it's hard for them to find engaging work in order for them to become full economic participants. %$* 261
there is increasing distrust and the-- %$* 261
amongst the millennial generation, amongst different groups of people, contrary to what we've heard tonight. %$* 261
and so i'm asking you all tonight not to vote for us because we need to win, because in a sense, we already have. %$* 261
we were born before they were into a world where we had greater opportunity. %$* 261
i'm asking you to vote for us because to do so is a tacit recognition that a problem does in fact exist. %$* 261
and unless we recognize that a problem exists, we cannot solve it. %$* 261
and what i would like to see is for some of these infrastructural and structural problems to be addressed and resolved. %$* 261
so vote for the proposition, not that millennials are doomed, but that they do not have a chance as things stand today. %$* 261
thank you, binta brown. %$* 13
and that's our motion, "millennials don't stand a chance.” and here to summarize his position against this motion, david burstein. %$* 13
he's author of "fast future, how the millennial generation is shaping our world.” and he is the founder of generation 18. david burstein. %$* 13
so for most of our history, it has been older people who understood the world and where the world was headed better than younger people. %$* 263
and when we talk about young people, in this case we're talking about millennials, what we're really talking about is the future. %$* 263
and if you look at the past decade of our world and the amount of change that has taken place, yes, the world is always changing, but if you look particularly at the last 10 years and the accelerated pace of change, that is the comfort zone for this generation. %$* 263
and that pace of change, that increased constant disruption, constant need to adapt to new ideas, new technologies, new platforms, new ways of doing things in our society, that is where this generation is not only comfortable but truly excels. %$* 263
so, in fact, young people and millennials at this time understand more about what is going to happen in our world than anyone else does. %$* 263
and we are actually leading the charge on a number of those different things. %$* 263
so when binta says that we are-- %$* 263
what's going to happen, this generation is already stepping up to lead, we're entrepreneurs, we're innovators, there are people in this generation who are shaping the context and the reality of the world of everyone in this room and everyone on this planet. %$* 263
so to say that millennials don't stand a chance, i think, in fact, millennials not only stand a chance but have an incredible advantage. %$* 263
as we look at what's going to happen in the next 20, 40 years, this is historically the generations of people who are younger, who understand the future, who understand where things are headed, who see an opportunity and move it forward, are able to do service not only for themselves but to the entire-- %$* 263
their entire generation and people of all generations. %$* 263
so i think that this generation has incredible promise, we're not the greatest generation that ever lived, but we certainly stand a very good chance. %$* 263
so i'd urge you all to vote against the resolution. %$* 263
thank you, david burstein. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to learn which side has argued the best in the opinion of our live audience. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat and register your vote, the second vote. %$* 13
we'll get the readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
the motion is "millennials don't stand a chance.” push number one if you're for the motion, two if you are against the motion, and three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
again, it's the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second vote who will be declared our winner. %$* 13
and as that is happening, i would like to actually-- %$* 13
i would like to congratulate the debaters on this stage for-- %$* 13
number one, it takes a lot of guts to come up here and debate. %$* 13
it’s a scary thing, and they all did it, and they all faced up to it. %$* 13
number two, they did it in such a respectful manner, something that could have become nasty, childish, and ridiculous was actually high-toned, informative, and respectful, so our congratulations to all. %$* 13
a few things, we want to-- %$* 13
love to have you tweet about this debate. %$* 13
and you can do that with our selfie mirror-- %$* 13
in the lobby. %$* 13
you can-- %$* 13
if you're over the age of 35, everyone else will explain it to you. %$* 13
but there's a pink-framed mirror, you take a picture of yourself, and that's a selfie, and isn't that cool. %$* 13
but if you do it-- %$* 13
tweet it to us at iq2us, and use the hashtag "millennials.” our next debate will be may 7.it will be right here at the kauffman music center. %$* 13
the motion is "death is not final.” and what we're looking at on this one, we're looking at whether the prospect of existence after death is a thing that is real and provable by science or it's a construct of wishful thinking. %$* 13
and for the motion we actually have somebody who's been arguing about this a lot, dr. %$* 13
eben alexander. %$* 13
he's a neurosurgeon who had a near-death experience during a weeklong coma, but he says it changed his understanding of how the brain works. %$* 13
and he's written about that, and it's fascinating. %$* 13
and it's really why we decided to take on this debate. %$* 13
his partner is dr. %$* 13
raymond moody. %$* 13
he's a psychologist, a medical doctor, and a leading authority on near-death experience. %$* 13
he actually coined that phrase in the '70s. %$* 13
against the motion, against them, sean carroll is a cal tech physicist, and he says that believing in life after death requires physics beyond the standard model. %$* 13
and his partner is dr. %$* 13
steven novella, a neurologist at the yale school of medicine. %$* 13
and he's host of the popular weekly science podcasts, "the skeptic's guide to the universe.” tickets to that are available at our website. %$* 13
we still have some. %$* 13
and the website is www.iq2us.org. %$* 13
and i've already mentioned this a few times, but we're being live- streamed on fora.tv. %$* 13
you can always watch that live stream and listen to our debates on npr stations across the nation. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
so, i have the results all in. %$* 13
remember, you voted twice on this motion: millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
the team whose numbers changed the most between the first and the second vote will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let's look at the results from the first of the two votes. %$* 13
in the first vote, "millennials don't stand a chance," 18 percent of you agreed with this. %$* 13
47 percent were against. %$* 13
35 percent were undecided. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
we compare the second round of results now. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be our winner. %$* 13
the second round. %$* 13
in the second round, the team arguing for the motion-- %$* 13
their vote was 38 percent. %$* 13
that's 18 to 38 percent. %$* 13
that's a gain of 20 percentage points. %$* 13
that's the number to beat. %$* 13
let's look at the team against the motion. %$* 13
their first vote was 47 percent. %$* 13
the second vote, 52 percent. %$* 13
that's only five percentage points, not enough to win. %$* 13
victory goes to the side arguing for the motion: millennials don't stand a chance. %$* 13
our congratulations to them and thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

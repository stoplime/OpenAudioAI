that proves my point. %$* 331
if you read from the koran and you say it's a religion of no compulsion and you believe that that verse is practiced by a person like you, you will concede that there are other muslims who will read the verse that i just quoted and be inspired to engage in acts of violence. %$* 331
and, by the way, the verse that you just said, it has a latter part that says, "except for the unbeliever-- %$* 331
sure, i'm sure every %$* 330
let's after this. %$* 13
well, my last point was that it is both, it's not just a religion of peace, it's also a religion of war, and both verses prove that. %$* 331
okay, do you want to respond to that, zeba, or do you want to-- %$* 13
okay, douglas. %$* 13
and that is an important one. %$* 333
ayaan and i and people who make some of the points we make are often accused of taking bits of the koran out of context. %$* 333
but i think you've just seen a very good example of it from the other side. %$* 333
i'm not saying that that isn't a good verse to live one's life by. %$* 333
one cannot just simply quote the verse about there being no compulsion in religion as though it doesn't have a follow on-- %$* 333
and you can't quote the other ones either without context. %$* 330
it has a follow on. %$* 331
as though it doesn't have a follow on, and as ayaan has just showed you, it has a follow on. %$* 333
yeah, so do those ones, as do those ones. %$* 330
so i think this gets back to the very important question the lady halfway back there made which is whether or not this can be a religion of peace. %$* 333
i believe it can be, and when i said earlier there are three types of islam i identified. %$* 333
there's the first one, the scriptures, the light from mohammad and so on, bad. %$* 333
second one, sharia interpretations, bad. %$* 333
but, thirdly, the way muslims live their lives today in this country and countries like it, that is our source for hope, and the source of hope for that is they individually use-- %$* 333
like many people do really, i'm not a religious person. %$* 333
ayaan isn't either. %$* 333
but we recognize the fact that people of religious faith have the right to that faith, should practice that faith, should have no fear of practicing that faith. %$* 333
there's no problem with it. %$* 333
but it's a private matter, and one which people come to very strange private arrangements about. %$* 333
and i just wanted to add this, which is that if those people are going to be able to reform that faith into a religion of peace you’re talking about. %$* 333
then, yes, we would be the first people to encourage that. %$* 333
but if we’re going to have that debate, as i hope we’ve shown tonight, it has to start with honesty. %$* 333
let’s do one more round of questions. %$* 13
dana, do we have time for one more round? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
so i’m going to do it again. %$* 13
i would love to hear from an audience member who is a member of the muslim community if you feel like speaking. %$* 13
and not that i’m profiling but i saw a lot of blond people raising their hands. %$* 13
and again, i realize it’s a complex world. %$* 13
that kind of profiling is allowed. %$* 331
jihad jane was blonde. %$* 333
all right. %$* 13
i’m going to take someone from the left. %$* 13
yes, blond person, you can go. %$* 13
anybody from the-- %$* 13
yeah, okay. %$* 13
okay, go ahead. %$* 13
and then on the right side, yes. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
ma’am, i see you. %$* 13
yep. %$* 13
and again, remember the way that great question was phrased? %$* 13
that’s how you do it. %$* 13
so for those in favor of the motion, my question is-- %$* 19
what she just read from the koran. %$* 19
you didn’t agree with it and clearly you’re interpreting the religion as you will and in a very peaceful way, which is great, but do you ignore those parts? %$* 19
how do you react to it? %$* 19
you said there were multiple ways, just like we interpret the constitution, there are multiple ways of interpreting what the koran is saying. %$* 19
i just want to know exactly how you interpret that chapter she just read to us. %$* 19
thank you. %$* 13
to that end, i happen to be roman catholic but my wife is israeli and my son just went through his bar mitzvah. %$* 13
there is some pretty spicy stuff in leviticus. %$* 13
i had no idea. %$* 13
but then catholicism went through the reformation and enlightenment. %$* 331
i’m from pakistan. %$* 19
i’m a muslim from pakistan and i just want to comment on the suicide bombings. %$* 19
there’s one almost every week and if you feel that as a nation, after being destroyed repeatedly since 9/11, we would still be sympathetic to extremist sentiments when our, you know-- %$* 19
two of my students were killed in suicide bombings. %$* 19
what is your question? %$* 13
my question is, i want you to consider what the value of the socio-economic, cultural factors, political dictatorships, what role do those factors play in making young people susceptible to extremism? %$* 19
do you not feel that maajid covered that in his remarks, because i feel that he did? %$* 13
well i don’t think maybe the audience understands. %$* 19
let me put it on hold then. %$* 13
and then the third person? %$* 13
i have a question for ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 19
i’m a muslim woman and she was referring to the subjugation of women. %$* 19
this has to do with the subjugation of women. %$* 19
i’m from india and my question is, if women are not educated, you know, in a lot of muslim countries, that’s the problem. %$* 19
women are not educated. %$* 19
and when they’re not educated, they don’t know what their rights are and so they’re not going to demand their rights. %$* 19
that’s the whole point in not educating half the population. %$* 19
but my question to you is, what does that have to do with islam, because according to my understanding of the koran the first word that was revealed of the koran to the prophet mohammed was read. %$* 19
that has to do with education. %$* 19
and the koran-- %$* 19
so, can you give me a question in one sentence? %$* 13
i know you can, so go for it. %$* 13
my question is, what does this have to do with islam? %$* 19
because the koran doesn’t say that, according to my understanding. %$* 19
does it say educate men, do not educate women? %$* 19
no where in the koran have i found that. %$* 19
let’s take that last question first, ayaan. %$* 13
thank you so much for that question. %$* 331
i completely agree with you that women in the muslim world today-- %$* 331
not all of them, but most of them-- %$* 331
are denied education. %$* 331
the reasons that are given by those who do the denying are islamic. %$* 331
they refer the concept of guardianship, so the guardian has the authority to decide whether he sends a girl to school or not, and for how long she goes to school. %$* 331
the main reason in muslim countries where girls are sent to school-- %$* 331
muslim communities where girls are sent to school, the main reason for pulling them out at the age of menstruation is the fear, the terror, that they might lose their virginity. %$* 331
that modesty, sexual modesty that is demanded of girls, which at first it preceded islam, was a tribal arab culture, elevated to religion in islam, where people find, within the koran, that-- %$* 331
and the hadith, that insistency on her virginity, on her being a virgin on the night of her wedding, that is one of the main reasons that is given. %$* 331
and if sexual emancipation were to occur within the muslim world-- %$* 331
and i want to challenge a guy like maajid nawaz to take the forefront as a man by saying that you value a partner, a human being, more than her hymen. %$* 331
that would revolutionize islam completely. %$* 331
that would-- %$* 331
it would take-- %$* 331
girls would go to school. %$* 331
they would be independent. %$* 331
they would be able to articulate what their rights are. %$* 331
and, more importantly, they could make islam a religion of peace because they would bring their boys up to be employable, to be educated, and to pronounce suicide killings and martyrdom-- %$* 331
uneducated mothers, uneducated mothers are mothers whose children, whose boys, bad guys can take advantage of it. %$* 331
we're at the point where normally we move on to our third round. %$* 13
we have these two questions standing out there. %$* 13
and i'm going to extend it, with everybody's acceptance, a few minutes of this section tonight. %$* 13
nobody seems to be leaving, and no one's asleep. %$* 13
so maajid, if you can be very brief to that, and then i want to get to the last question. %$* 13
well, actually, to be honest, i value a can of diet coke more than a hymen. %$* 332
i mean, really, everything's more valuable to me than a hymen, and especially a woman. %$* 332
so i really don't understand the point of your question there. %$* 332
but allow me to say, however, that every muslim questioner from the audience today is not a true muslim. %$* 332
and every one of you may be a christian is not really a christian. %$* 332
and any of you who may be a jew is not really a jew, because i have the absolute monopoly of defining all three of those religions for all of you. %$* 332
and, really, the passages that-- %$* 332
i'm saying this because of the first question. %$* 332
and that is, the passages that were referred to about fight them wherever you see them. %$* 332
now, the thing is really, the founding fathers of this great country who wrote the constitution believed in slavery and were practicing slavery. %$* 332
now, does that mean that we're going to define the whole of america and its constitution by that practice, or are we going to contextualize that practice and say that when they founded this country, slavery sand abolishing slavery was not at the forefront of their minds, but later on, it was abolished, and that's an achievement for this country. %$* 332
it's not something that defines this country. %$* 332
and so likewise these passages, yes, they can be used, and they are used in a problematic way. %$* 332
and it's our responsibility, not just as muslims, but as decent human beings, to go out there and challenge the abuse of these passages. %$* 332
but we must not forget that as if with every other document in history, it had its context, and it was abused. %$* 332
and now when we have gone ex post facto, we can look back to that and judge it with a very civilized standard that we've arrived at and say that was wrong. %$* 332
now, perhaps-- %$* 332
and let me put the question-- %$* 13
let me put that-- %$* 13
i may be defined %$* 332
i want to put the question as it was phrased to zeba, which was how do you filter out-- %$* 13
right, exactly. %$* 13
how do you filter that out? %$* 13
so how do i interpret is what you're asking. %$* 330
despite what our opposition says, i do have that right. %$* 330
and basically, i look at my faith-- %$* 330
i'm sorry. %$* 330
who asked the question? %$* 330
i look at my faith and the way i was raised with core islamic principles, which is how my family raised me, and that i determined as an adult were correct, which is compassion and tolerance and plurality and strength and diversity, because we are a diverse population. %$* 330
there are as many interpretations of islam as there are people. %$* 330
and so the other point i want to make to that is that there are clergy and clerics who do stress this. %$* 330
i mean, if you look at 2005 at the imam message, where 200 muslim scholars from 50 countries addressed a reemphasis of islam's core values of compassion, mutual respect, acceptance, freedom of religion. %$* 330
there is precedent for this not just for me as a layperson but from the clergy as well, to reassert these lost-- %$* 330
in some areas, lost values. %$* 330
douglas murray. %$* 13
this is a very, very complex one. %$* 333
but it has to be said. %$* 333
maajid has just given the comparison of the founding fathers, and there has to be some clarity about this. %$* 333
this country rightly reveres your founding fathers. %$* 333
but you don't think that their word was immutable or unchangeable. %$* 333
no. %$* 330
you don't believe-- %$* 333
i don't know. %$* 333
i don't think that anyone in this room who criticized mr. %$* 333
jefferson now here tonight, will be declared an anti-american apostate who can be fit for slaughter. %$* 333
the problem that our opponents have to address, they have to address it, is that a religion which is based on the idea that the koran was dictated direct by god to mohammad and that therefore if you are criticizing the koran or throwing out a bit or pulling it apart, like most christians and jews-- %$* 333
most christians and jews have come to that stage where pretty much you pick a mix with your holy scriptures. %$* 333
and it's quite a good, humane way around it. %$* 333
but with islam, if this is the revealed word of god, revealed, it has to be said, as it was shown again earlier tonight in a particularly obscure and unreadable dialect, which-- %$* 333
if it was meant to be understood by the whole of the world, it's a bad place to start. %$* 333
if this were the case, then, as i say, we come back to this problem. %$* 333
founding fathers did-- %$* 333
said many great things and did some bad things. %$* 333
but you are not committed as americans not to criticize the bad things they did. %$* 333
and this is a problem our opponents are going to have address. %$* 333
and that concludes round two of our debate. %$* 13
so here is where we are. %$* 13
we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
and this is their last chance to change your minds and to respond to some of what's been said over the last hour. %$* 13
you will be asked to vote, once again, and to pick the winner, just a few minutes from now. %$* 13
but first on to round three, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is, “islam is a religion of peace.” and speaking first against the motion, ayaan hirsi ali, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and a critic of fundamentalist islam. %$* 13
islam is not a religion of peace. %$* 331
and i woke up to the facts on the 11th of september, 2001.perhaps i should have woken up to the facts earlier. %$* 331
but i admit that i did that then at that time. %$* 331
talking to people of my faith, islam, and my friends, and discussing with them, i remember all kind of fallacious arguments. %$* 331
but i remember one consistent thing, and that was to exempt islam from any criticism. %$* 331
it was culture. %$* 331
it wasn't islam. %$* 331
but a religion is born in a culture. %$* 331
and if that culture is not peaceful, then that religion is not peaceful. %$* 331
i was told it's politics. %$* 331
we've heard it tonight many times. %$* 331
it's not religion. %$* 331
but islam not only has a pious dimension but it also has a political dimension, a complex system of laws, a political philosophy on how society should be organized. %$* 331
and if you look at that political system, it's anything but peaceful. %$* 331
what emancipated me from the order to submit my will completely to allah, which in practice means the concentration of power in the hands of a few, was to learn to think critically, the enlightenment. %$* 331
vote against this motion and open up the flaws of islam for debate in order that muslims, those who are not yet emancipated, may take charge of their own reason, of their own faculty. %$* 331
vote against the motion that islam is a religion of peace and toss-- %$* 331
toss that fallacy into the trashcan of history. %$* 331
thank you. %$* 331
thank you. %$* 13
ayaan hirsi ali. %$* 13
our motion is islam is a religion of peace. %$* 13
now to summarize her position for the motion, zeba khan, writer and advocate for muslim american civic engagement. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 330
faisal shahzad, the underwear bomber, and the group of young men that were picked up in pakistan, all of them were for violence and trying to attack our country and learning how to attack our country elsewhere. %$* 330
but the one thing that the media consistently forgets to mention or conveniently forgets to mention is who turned all of them in. %$* 330
it was muslims. %$* 330
it was their families, because that is a koranic principle, that you stand up for justice, even if it's against yourself. %$* 330
and in this case, someone's son or several people's sons, the underwear bomber's father who was nigerian and not american, did this, turned him in, and sent word to the authorities. %$* 330
and a senegalese merchant was one of the first unreported, but was one of the first people to see the times square attempted bomber. %$* 330
our opponents have a very simplistic outlook on this-- %$* 330
on the world and what's currently at stake. %$* 330
they see it being islam versus the west. %$* 330
but the truth is it's not. %$* 330
it's between moderates and extremists of all kinds. %$* 330
and i urge you to vote for the motion because the overwhelming majority of muslims, the facts are clear, they are peaceful, they're mainstream, and they condemn violence against civilians and have no interest in terrorism, which is consistently as the woman in the audience said, are attacking muslims, mainstream muslims every day, brutally, and oppressing them because we don't accept their version of islam. %$* 330
i'm asking for your help for-- %$* 330
as other people, as people of reason and of people of a moderate voice to support us as we fight them and we are fighting them, although we don't hear it as often in the media, which focuses on violence and fear. %$* 330
but the fact is, muslims have always been fighting them. %$* 330
zeba khan, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 330
thank you very much. %$* 13
our motion is, "islam is a religion of peace" and here to summarize his position against the motion, douglas murray, bestselling author, founder, and director of the center for social cohesion. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 333
well, thank you for a very enlightening, i think, debate tonight. %$* 333
i think we on this side made it very clear that we don’t think there's a fight between islam and the west or islam and civilization or anything else like that. %$* 333
we've made a very clear set of points tonight, and one of those points, which i hope people bear in mind, is we have said repeatedly that it is in muslims and their critical faculties, muslims and their behavior, muslims and their faith that we have hope. %$* 333
and it is in people like you that we have hope for the future, and if the motion were that islam a century from now could be a religion of peace and people would be quoting zeba and maajid and seminal moments like this and that they had learned-- %$* 333
well, that would be terrific, but at the moment, tonight, you're being asked to vote on whether islam is now a religion of peace, is islam a religion of peace? %$* 333
i think it is very clear that it is not. %$* 333
this does not mean-- %$* 333
of course, it doesn't mean that muslims are all violent. %$* 333
we would never make that point. %$* 333
we never have made that point, nor does it mean that there isn't hope in the future, nor does it mean that we have to have continual clashes until the end of time, but it means we have to start by being honest. %$* 333
we have to be frank about what we see in islamic history, in islamic conquests, and in islamic script. %$* 333
we have to be frank about that. %$* 333
in societies which islam dominated, conquered, and subdued the peoples in the middle ages, people who were not muslim were sometimes allowed to remain in those societies but they were allowed to do so only by having second class status. %$* 333
i would ask you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, not to be dhimmis, not to have second-class status, not to vote for things because you think it's polite or because you think you have to say them but because you think they're true. %$* 333
on that basis, the idea you could vote for the motion tonight is absurd. %$* 333
islam is palpably, demonstrably, evidently not a religion of peace. %$* 333
vote against this motion. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 13
our motion is, "islam is a religion of peace." and our final speaker to argue for the motion that "islam is a religion of peace," maajid nawaz, director of the quilliam foundation and formerly a member of a radical islamist party. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 332
right. %$* 332
so i'm not going to ask you to be polite. %$* 332
i would dread to think that that's why you'd vote for the motion. %$* 332
in fact, what i'd like to do is give you four reasons to vote-- %$* 332
basically four reasons why the panel's arguments are incorrect and four reasons then to vote for the motion. %$* 332
and as for the failure of the panel, i think number one is that there's a failure to contextualize. %$* 332
as i've tried to say time and time again, there's a failure to contextualize history and texts and sources, and there's an intellectual suspension that occurs when discussing islam that simply doesn't occur when discussing the constitution or any other piece of literature or writing. %$* 332
secondly, there's a failure to disclose. %$* 332
and as we've heard from the panel, both of them-- %$* 332
and there's nothing wrong with this, by the way-- %$* 332
both of them are not believers of any faith, and that's their perfect right to do so, but they've made it clear their real agenda is with all religions. %$* 332
and i think we have to be honest with ourselves, that actually religions can and have historically played much good and have come to much good in the world, including the reformation despite the fact we have to contextualize it. %$* 332
thirdly, there's a failure to nuance, and as we've heard, gross generalizations about islam by quoting isolated passages are being made. %$* 332
and fourthly there's a failure to be honest. %$* 332
and that honesty is in refusing to recognize that a vast majority of muslims where there have been democratic elections have refused to turn in the extremists, as the examples i've cited in bangladesh and pakistan. %$* 332
now, please vote for the motion, and the reason i'd say that is reclaim islam, don't let the minority hijack it. %$* 332
yes, even for those of you who are not muslims, reclaim it, because it's a faith like all other faiths that does need to be redefined in current times. %$* 332
secondly, vote for peace. %$* 332
this is not a vote for islam. %$* 332
it's a vote for peace. %$* 332
and i'm sure all of us want peace. %$* 332
and thirdly i'd say help the confused muslims in the world, the factions, the minority, the young minds, like i was, who are confused, help them make up their minds by giving them guidance, by giving them an olive branch and voting for peace tonight. %$* 332
and finally, i’d say that even if you’re unsure, even if you think that islam is not a religion for peace, i would ask all of you hear tonight to vote as we heard the admission from the panel, it can be a religion of peace, so vote for what you’d like islam to be. %$* 332
if you’d like islam to be a religion of peace, then vote for it. %$* 332
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements, and now it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
okay, yes. %$* 13
now it’s time to learn which side has argued best. %$* 13
we are asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
we’ll get this read out almost instantaneously. %$* 13
our motion is “islam is a religion of peace.” if you agree with the motion, push number one, if you disagree, if you’re against the motion, push number two. %$* 13
if you’re undecided, push number three and we’ll have the results in about a minute. %$* 13
before we get there, i just want to say this has been probably the most spirited debate that we’ve ever had and i thought it was conducted mostly with respect and with honesty and i want to congratulate all of our panelists for coming out here. %$* 13
i want to thank all of you in our audience. %$* 13
the questions were all excellent, including, ma’am, the one i didn’t get to. %$* 13
i apologize. %$* 13
it was a time issue. %$* 13
but the questions were terrific and i want to thank all of you for coming through the metal detectors, which were a metaphor in a way for the situation that we’re in and the reason that we’re debating this topic. %$* 13
but you should give yourselves a round of applause for being here for taking part in this tonight. %$* 13
i want to let you know that our next debate will be on tuesday, the 26th of october. %$* 13

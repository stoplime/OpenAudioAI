now our debaters have just come to the stage, i want to begin the evening with a round of applause for all of them. %$* 13
at this point, tedious as it is, i must ask you to make sure your cell phones are off %$* 13
and i want to explain that, these debates are heard throughout the nation on npr stations, 150 npr stations. %$* 13
for that reason, i have to do certain bits of business that might seem somewhat inexplicable, such as repeating certain set phrases over and over again. %$* 13
please understand i have not lost my mind at that point, i am simply doing the radio bits of the program and they will pass quickly. %$* 13
and with that i would like to introduce the chairman of intelligence squared us, robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well, thank you very much, and welcome. %$* 1
our debate tonight is “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” now this is—the topic is not: the security position in iraq is dramatically improved. %$* 1
i think it’s very difficult to argue that one. %$* 1
i’d like to quote from a united states senator who voted against the surge and still feels that his vote was correct. %$* 1
he said, quote, “in the 18 months since president bush announced the surge, our troops have performed heroically in bringing down the level of violence. %$* 1
new tactics have protected the iraqi population, and the sunni tribes have rejected al-qaeda, greatly weakening its effectiveness.” that united states senator was barack obama. %$* 1
most of the times when i get up before this audience to talk about the debate, i try to talk about semantics, because we don’t want the debate really to be about the language of the resolution. %$* 1
but this time it’s different, this time the debate in a very real sense is about the language of the resolution. %$* 1
what does it mean to be “winning” the war in iraq. %$* 1
well it seems to me that there are a number of levels at which you might, uh, gauge success. %$* 1
first of all is the notion that after we leave, will there be sectarian violence, will there be civil war. %$* 1
at a minimum, the answer to that has to be no. %$* 1
but again %$* 1
there are goals for what the domestic situation in iraq might look like after success. %$* 1
a reasonably decent society, a reasonably representative government. %$* 1
raising the bar even higher, us strategic interests, the us would like to have a friendly iraq. %$* 1
we’d like to have security for our energy supplies, we’d like to be able to project military power in the region, to a greater extent than we could before we entered this war. %$* 1
and finally there are strategic regional considerations. %$* 1
we’d like to be able to manage kurdish aspirations without doing violence to our ongoing relationship with turkey. %$* 1
we’d like to be able to manage shia aspirations, without handing iran even more influence in the region than it already has. %$* 1
so these are very daunting goals for victory and i’m not suggesting that we have to achieve all of them, but the meaning of the resolution, the meaning of what we mean by winning the war in iraq, is really in a sense the subject of tonight’s debate. %$* 1
we have an extraordinary panel, and i’m in for a treat that many of you have already had which is the experience of john donvan as moderator. %$* 1
and it’s really my pleasure to turn the evening over to john. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
may i urge one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making these evenings possible. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, a correspondent for abc news and abc news “nightline,” and your host and moderator for this intelligence squared us debate, oxford-style debating, brought to american shores, where, in this program, the motion is, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” we are speaking and gathered at the caspary auditorium at the rockefeller university in new york city. %$* 13
you will hear from four panelists on this motion, two who are for the motion, and two who are against. %$* 13
the debate will take place in three parts, there will be an opening section, a mix-it-up section of q-and-a including questions from me and questions from you, the audience, and then finally closing statements. %$* 13
this is a contest of persuasion. %$* 13
the goal of the panelists is to the change the minds of this audience assembled in an amphitheater, surrounding the stage, several hundred of you, who will come into this event, with their minds perhaps not made up, or made up, the goal of these people is to move your opinion. %$* 13
shortly we will take a vote to see what your views are on this motion as you come in off the streets, but i first want to explain. %$* 13
in the opening round the panelists will have seven minutes each. %$* 13
as they approach the six-minute mark, in order to provide them with a warning that their time is running out, they will hear a tone that sounds like this— that’s the one-minute mark, we consider it rather gentle and mild. %$* 13
but to be taken seriously. %$* 13
at seven minutes, if the speaker has not wrapped up, the tone will become more insistent, more like this— and nobody wants to talk through that. %$* 13
so once again the topic tonight is, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” it is time now to take our vote, and, as you see, by your seats you have a device that will allow you to vote on this motion. %$* 13
if you are for the motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” please press number 1. if you are against the motion, number 2. if you are undecided at this point, please push number 3. does anyone need more time? %$* 13
it’s really rather simple. %$* 13
it’s time now for our panelists to begin making their opening statements, and i just want to go back, and remind people of where we were in 2006 when the war in iraq was not going very well from the point of view of the united states, and from the point of view of president bush, who wanted a victory. %$* 13
he sought out a go-between, somebody who could make a trip out to the war front, and come back and tell him whether victory was possible, and how. %$* 13
the person he chose is our first panelist tonight, retired four-star general, jack keane, who made those trips to iraq, and came back convinced that a surge was the way to go. %$* 13
often to the chagrin of the joint chiefs of staff, he made this argument to the president in a series of meetings over several weeks and months. %$* 13
the entire story is told in bob woodward’s most recent book, but at this point you certainly know where general jack keane stands on our motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq.” general? %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 614
appreciate that nice introduction. %$* 614
somewhat accurate, somewhat inaccurate. %$* 614
it’s always great to be back in my hometown, new york city. %$* 614
i don’t need much excuse to come here, i love this place. %$* 614
even though i spent most of my adult life in other places. %$* 614
but it always has been home, even though i don’t live here, i live in washington, d.c.i come here for the metropolitan opera and my beloved yankees. %$* 614
i know i’ve probably alienated half the audience now, i’m not supposed to do that. %$* 614
but i’m delighted to be here and obviously this is an important subject and one that fred and i have been very much involved in for a couple years. %$* 614
my involvement in iraq goes back to 2003 when i was on active duty and, i visited iraq right after the invasion, and shortly left active duty. %$* 614
i joined secretary rumsfeld’s policy board at his request with henry kissinger and newt gingrich and tom foley and freddy clay, a bunch of others. %$* 614
and iraq became an increasingly more important subject for us, as the war unfolded before our eyes and the challenges that we were facing. %$* 614
in 2006, i parted company with the administration and the pentagon over the war in iraq, because i thought—i believed our strategy was failing. %$* 614
i took that message to secretary rumsfeld, and also the chairman of the joint chiefs, peter pace, and had devised a new strategy to help promulgate that. %$* 614
while i was in the throes of developing that strategy i met fred kagan, over at the american enterprise institute, and he put together a planning group that was looking at the war and a new strategy, and we found that, our ideas were exactly the same. %$* 614
and eventually, with others, and i may say others, that had some influence on the president of the united states to admit, that the strategy was failing, and it needed to be changed. %$* 614
i tell you that because, i knew what failure looked like. %$* 614
and i think so did you. %$* 614
and i also know what the word “winning,” or “success” looks like in iraq, it’s been a stunning achievement in iraq, somewhat unprecedented in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, for such a dramatic turnaround in such a short period of time. %$* 614
and that stunning achievement that %$* 614
you are generally familiar with it. %$* 614
but it’s based certainly on a new strategy, but it’s also based on the premise that security was a necessary precondition for political and economic progress. %$* 614
we had never had that, as a staple, before we tried to do it complementary among those three issues, and that blew up and failed. %$* 614
that’s the reality of it. %$* 614
so we had to get security if we were gonna make political progress and that is a stunning achievement, in such a short period of time. %$* 614
zero ethno-sectarian violence. %$* 614
all of the violence dramatically down 60 to 80 percent depending on the category, i won’t go into the details of all of that, some of you are familiar with it but it’s quite remarkable. %$* 614
most of the time, we go to iraq every few months, about every three months for two weeks at a time, we spend most of our time with the iraqi people. %$* 614
out on the streets where they are, in the schools, in their hospitals, seeing what life was like, in 2006, no children going to schools, hundreds of people being killed every week, people not going to their jobs, only going to marketplaces to seek provisions on an emergency basis. %$* 614
terrorized and intimidated, a country fracturing, heading towards civil war, it was not a civil war, and a possibly failed state. %$* 614
the conditions in iraq today and gradually improving over 2007 and 2008 are a dramatic difference. %$* 614
schools, all schools, are open, in iraq. %$* 614
primary, secondary, and 27 colleges, universities and technical colleges that they, they have in iraq. %$* 614
the marketplaces are teeming, there’s a social fabric in iraq that’s taken place in the evening, or on the days off when people are visiting zoos and what’s left of museums and, the, the natural rhythm of life is returning to the people of iraq. %$* 614
iraq is all about its people, in my judgment, so that is why we spend so much time understanding what happened to them, and what is now happening to them. %$* 614
and it’s fascinating to see. %$* 614
the security situation dramatically improved because the mainstream sunni insurgents who started the war have capitulated. %$* 614
they have surrendered. %$* 614
they are coming into the political process, to achieve their political objectives. %$* 614
and that is a dramatic turnaround and that’s how insurgency—either insurgencies end when they walk away and leave the field of battle or they come into the political process. %$* 614
the al-qaeda have been operationally defeated. %$* 614
they no longer threaten the legitimacy of the regime. %$* 614
they cannot mount a sustained campaign to do that. %$* 614
they don’t have the infrastructure or the networks to do it. %$* 614
shia extremism, has had a major setback supported by the iranians, and as time appears to be playing out for us, it appears that it’s going to be a major defeat as well. %$* 614
the impact on the political process, is extraordinary, there’s a rising political class in iraq, that we have seen. %$* 614
every place you go in iraq, people are interested in the political process. %$* 614
participating in it, there are 500-plus parties in iraq. %$* 614
i mean, we struggle with these two that we have. %$* 614
to say the least. %$* 614
can you imagine what it’s like. %$* 614
the youth in iraq, and we’ve attended some of their party meetings, it’s wonderful to see their energy and their motivation and to participate in something that’s all new to them. %$* 614
a fledgling democracy. %$* 614
it’s fascinating to see this taking hold in iraq. %$* 614
the national legislative benchmarks, 18 of them have been %$* 614
only one out of the 18 has not succeeded, and that is really, quite dramatic. %$* 614
the political reconciliation that has taken place in iraq is very real, the most recent one is the provincial election law, which will redefine iraq, it is a seminal event. %$* 614
power will be shared, and diffused in the provinces, the people will get better services as a result of it, they will have their own budgets, they will have a place to go to express their grievances and their needs. %$* 614
iraq will never be the same again as a result of what is gonna take place in january of this year. %$* 614
less than three years after this government, as inefficient as it has been at times and ineffective as it has been at times, when you draw back from it, it has been a remarkable movement towards what the premise is here. %$* 614
success in iraq, success in iraq for them, and success in iraq for us. %$* 614
thank you, general jack keane, arguing for the motion. %$* 13
when a guy hits it big in software and then he sells his company to microsoft for more than $100 million and then he decides that he wants to start making movies, there is a tendency to think well maybe here’s another rich guy with a vanity project on his mind, except that the movie that our next panelist made, his name is charles ferguson, it’s a documentary on the us experience in iraq. %$* 13
it premiered last year and was almost universally reviewed as superb and serious and ultimately became a contender for an oscar award. %$* 13
though he did not oppose the invasion of iraq initially, the title of his film tells you where he stands now, very quickly, it is called, no end in sight. %$* 13
charles ferguson, arguing tonight against the motion. %$* 13
thank you very much, i made this film actually, largely because of my heritage as a policy wonk, before i made money, i got a doctorate in political science at mit, my thesis advisor, carl kazin, had been deputy national security advisor for president kennedy. %$* 555
and he endeavored to teach me to think rigorously about these matters and i will leave it to you to see whether he succeeded to any measure. %$* 555
he also had a wicked sense of humor which i will feebly attempt to imitate. %$* 555
if the entire cast of “saturday night live” had somehow gotten together with the marx brothers, the three stooges, and charlie chaplin, and they had tried, in their wildest dreams, to think up a catastrophe of a war, they could not possibly have become remotely close, to what the bush administration did in iraq. %$* 555
and, i will endeavor to demonstrate that, in the remaining time of my remarks, damage on that scale is not repaired with a surge, it is not repaired over a short time, this is something that that nation and the united states and the world are going to be recovering from for decades. %$* 555
and, if you think that we’re winning the war in iraq in any meaningful sense now, then, i invite you to wait a few weeks when the dow is down to about 2000, and henry paulsen stands on the rubble of the american financial system and declares victory when the bleeding has stopped. %$* 555
that would be a roughly comparable—and i’m sure that will happen soon—that would be a roughly comparable kind of event. %$* 555
why was this war fought in the view of those who decided to fight it? %$* 555
i was an ambivalently, complicatedly, slightly favorable towards the war kind of person, or towards the idea of deposing saddam. %$* 555
it was fought to remove the threat of wmd from iraq, and also from the region. %$* 555
to install a pro-western democratic government, to bring peace and freedom and liberty and security to the population of iraq and also to spread that to the entire middle east. %$* 555
it was also intended to assist the united states in bringing economic, diplomatic and military pressure on iraq so that it would stop developing nuclear weapons. %$* 555
the administration predicted, and, sometimes said this publicly, believed it internally, widely known, widely quoted, that the costs of the war might reach $50 billion. %$* 555
and that us forces would probably be substantially withdrawn by september of 2003.so, what happened. %$* 555
not enough troops were used. %$* 555
planning for the war began 60 days before the invasion, planning for—excuse me, planning for the occupation, began 60 days before the invasion. %$* 555
it was vastly inadequate. %$* 555
looting destroyed the entire country, most of its infrastructure, 16 of 20 ministries, most important infrastructural objects, power plants, et cetera, were destroyed by the looting. %$* 555
the looting went completely unchecked by us forces. %$* 555
ambassador bremer when appointed, before he had set foot in iraq for the first time in his life, a man who had never served in the military, never overseen an occupation of any kind, on may 9th, 2003, he decided that he was going to issue a de- baathification order, which lopped off and purged for life the top 50,000 administrators and technocrats in iraq. %$* 555
he then disbanded the iraqi military, throwing half a million soldiers onto the street, unemployed, with no notice. %$* 555
who promptly formed the insurgency. %$* 555
virtually nothing was done about the insurgency, for quite a long time its existence was denied. %$* 555
economic policy was placed in the hands of politically appointed ideologues. %$* 555
and what did we see as a result. %$* 555
4,000 americans dead so far, a trillion and a half dollars spent, 100,000 americans wounded, twice the official number. %$* 555
the official number is a vast underestimate. %$* 555
and an iraq that is just destroyed. %$* 555
of iraq’s 34,000 physicians, 2,000 were assassinated, 20,000 left. %$* 555
25 percent of the population of iraq is either dead, or is displaced internally, or is external refugees, the equivalent of 60 million people in the united states having left the country. %$* 555
at the peak of the violence, several hundred people per day in iraq, were being kidnapped or killed. %$* 555
okay, so, but what of iraq now, i hear you say. %$* 555
has this country become a paradise. %$* 555
no it has not. %$* 555
violence is down. %$* 555
it’s down roughly 75 percent, we don’t know exactly how much. %$* 555
to some degree a sense of normalcy is returning to the country. %$* 555
people are haltingly able to go to school, to go to work now in ways that they previously were not. %$* 555
but, the infrastructure of the country remains destroyed, by most indicators, it remains below pre-war levels, in matters such as water supply, sewage treatment, electricity, power generation. %$* 555
the country is enormously traumatized, it went from being 55 or 60 percent shia to now, probably 80 percent shia because the refugees are overwhelmingly sunni. %$* 555
and a population and a government increasingly dominated, already thoroughly dominated by rather extremist, fundamentalist islamic parties and beliefs. %$* 555
it’s difficult to believe, but iraq still with the violence down 75 percent, iraq is still a more dangerous place and a more hostile place, and a worse place, for most people, than it was under saddam hussein. %$* 555
that is difficult to achieve. %$* 555
but we managed. %$* 555
in addition, we have enormously strengthened iran, which is continuing to develop nuclear weapons, unchecked by the united states. %$* 555
the american military is debilitated and tied down in this country, unable to do anything about the rapidly worsening situation in afghanistan and pakistan. %$* 555
the military is exhausted. %$* 555
and, as far as i know, those 4,000 americans are still dead, those half-million iraqis are still dead, and the situation remains, i fear, irretrievable. %$* 555
thank you. %$* 555
thank you, charles ferguson, i’m john donvan, and this is intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating. %$* 13
we have four panelists, for and against our proposition, which tonight is “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” we are halfway through our opening statements, and we’re now going to turn to once again to the side for the motion. %$* 13
jack keane’s debating partner, as he mentioned, was also his partner in advising the administration on going ahead with the surge and as general keane pointed out it wasn’t just the two of them, there were other people. %$* 13
but fred kagan has been universally described as the architect of the surge at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
he put the words on paper and connected the dots and drew up the charts and put together most cohesively the argument that ultimately persuaded the white house that the surge was the way to go. %$* 13
he is very much a player in the story of the surge having taken place. %$* 13
arguing for the motion, “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” fred kagan. %$* 13
thank you very much, it’s an honor to be here, it’s an honor to be talking about this extremely important topic. %$* 615
i might object to, excessive levity and discussions of marx brothers and so forth, in regard to a war that has cost the lives of many thousands of people, i actually think this issue’s a little more serious than that frankly. %$* 615
without meaning to spend my time taking on directly the comments that were just made i’m going to mention a couple of errors of fact. %$* 615
electricity production is higher than pre-war levels in iraq, that is a fact. %$* 615
the country is not 80 percent shia, although i’m sure that some of the shia parties would like to believe that. %$* 615
but it absolutely is not. %$* 615
and is life worse than under saddam, well, that depends on who you are. %$* 615
and, this has definitely been a traumatic, miserable experience for the iraqi people. %$* 615
i am in full agreement with the assertion that the bush administration planned for the war badly, conducted the war badly, lived in denial for years. %$* 615
i was on record for all of that time, criticizing the strategy that was being pursued, criticizing the administration %$* 615
i get it. %$* 615
it’s also irrelevant, to the point at hand. %$* 615
and it’s unfortunate in our national discourse, that we spend so much of our time refighting the issue of whether or not this was a good idea, and not enough time talking about where we are, where we’re headed, what our interests are, and whether we are likely to be able to achieve them. %$* 615
which is from the standpoint of a decision-maker, the only thing that matters. %$* 615
and particularly since, president bush, will not be running for office again, the question of his wisdom or un-wisdom in ordering this war, is something that can be safely left to the historians at this point. %$* 615
so, the question is where are we now, and the question the motion has put is, are we winning the war. %$* 615
i would like to amend the motion to say, “america and the iraqis are now finally winning.” because one of the things that has gone unnoticed, is that, a tremendous portion of the fighting that was done over the past 18 months was done by iraqis. %$* 615
including the 100,000 iraqi security forces that came on line, in a year, trained in contact with the enemy, marched directly into the fight against the enemy, both sunni and shia, and defeated the enemy across the board with american assistance of course. %$* 615
it was a remarkable thing. %$* 615
one of the most remarkable instances of this, was when prime minister al-maliki ordered the iraqi security forces to clear the city of basra, which was under the control of enemy groups of one sort and another. %$* 615
and, the initial operation was a disaster. %$* 615
we worked hard to help him fix it, he worked hard to fix it, and one of the things that he did to fix it, was to order the quick reaction force of the first iraqi army division, to reinforce. %$* 615
that division is based in anbar. %$* 615
it is a heavily sunni division. %$* 615
it marched into basra, where there are virtually no sunni, and immediately began fighting against local militias and criminals. %$* 615
there were no instances of sectarianism, either by that formation or against that formation. %$* 615
it was accepted, as the legitimate military force of the government of iraq, acting against criminals and enemies of iraq. %$* 615
as an instance of reconciliation, and what this government means to iraqis now, there are few cases that could be more poignant than that. %$* 615
that formation remained in the south, it continued to fight right up to the iranian border %$* 615
which also sent a message to iran by the way. %$* 615
and as we talk about how iran has been strengthened by this war, we need to talk about how iran has been dealt a tremendous defeat, by the destruction of its key proxy in iraq, muqtada al-sadr’s jaysh al-mahdi, which organization was militarily defeated, and has now largely disbanded politically as well. %$* 615
muqtada himself is in disgrace, and the iranians are scrambling, and hoping, that we will take council of our despair and leave iraq to its fate. %$* 615
the question will be put %$* 615
was this war worth it. %$* 615
i would submit, that that’s a slightly different question from whether we are winning or not and we can parse the semantics of this any way you like. %$* 615
as a military analyst which is all that i am, i can tell you, the trend lines now, are positive. %$* 615
the importance of the elections law that was just passed, passed most americans by. %$* 615
it is a watershed event. %$* 615
and i can tell that, because i’ve had in the past few weeks, conversations with senior politicians, senior iraqi military leaders, i’m sorry, senior iraqi politicians, sunni and shia, and before that law was passed, they were very grim, and very gloomy, and so was i.after that law was passed, the nature of the conversations that i had with these gentlemen, changed entirely. %$* 615
and instead of the gloom and doom, we had, almost wistful conversations about, how iraq will form itself into a country. %$* 615
how the sunni and shia will work together, what the relationship between arabs and kurds will be, and they also all made to me an interesting point. %$* 615
they said, you know, iraq will be a rival to saudi arabia. %$* 615
a rival in oil, and also, a threat to saudi arabia because iraq will be a democracy. %$* 615
and iraq will pose a challenge to authoritarian regimes around the region, and iraq will be aligned with the united states. %$* 615
they were telling me that. %$* 615
now i believe that that’s true, and i believe that it is attainable, and i think that the evidence shows that, and i think that, if we are in fact headed in that direction and we can in fact make that happen, then, this war will have been worth fighting. %$* 615
thank you. %$* 615
thank you, fred kagan, speaking for the motion. %$* 13
sir malcolm rifkind has held the post of foreign secretary of the united kingdom and defense secretary, a combination that, in this country the only figure i can think of to have comparably held the positions of state and defense would be george marshall. %$* 13
you can tell me, fred, if i’m wrong on that. %$* 13
he is a friend of the united states as a member of the conservative party who’s been in politics for 40 years, a supporter of many american policies and the special relationship, but when it came to iraq, he said no. %$* 13
he was against going in, he is against staying in now, and he will be arguing against the motion, sir malcolm rifkind. %$* 13
thank you very much indeed for your warm welcome. %$* 616
lyndon johnson once said that was the sort of introduction which my father would’ve enjoyed and my mother would’ve believed. %$* 616
i’m conscious that i’m the fourth person to speak this evening so i will say what king henry xiii of england is reputed to have said to each of his six wives. %$* 616
“please don’t worry, i don’t intend to keep you long.” i was at first concerned when i was asked to take part in this debate, whether, as a british politician, i should be speaking in a debate about the united states. %$* 616
but i reflected that george w.bush’s closest ally in the decision to go to war, was tony blair. %$* 616
british troops have been in iraq over those five years, british soldiers have died, and britain and the united states share a responsibility, along with other coalition countries, for what has happened. %$* 616
i don’t dispute for a moment that the surge to which reference has been made this evening, has been successful in military terms, in reducing the amount of violence. %$* 616
i don’t doubt that the insurgency itself, may be slowly coming to an end, and that fewer people are being killed on the streets of baghdad, than was the case in the past. %$* 616
but of course that is true of all wars, all wars gradually grind to an end, in one form or another. %$* 616
but that is not the same as saying, that you have won that war. %$* 616
because to say that you have won or are winning the war, you have to answer two questions. %$* 616
first of all, are we going to achieve the reasons why we went to war in the first place, either in whole or in part, and even if we were, does the price that has been paid, by the people of iraq and by the west as a whole, make that sacrifice having been worth being made. %$* 616
now when you look at what the plus side is, and there’s one factor that also has to be mentioned at this moment. %$* 616
this is not a war like pearl harbor. %$* 616
or like the war in afghanistan after 9-11, or the first gulf war to liberate kuwait. %$* 616
you are wrong, general keane, to say that sunni insurgents started this war, they didn’t. %$* 616
the united states, the united kingdom and the coalition started this war, and they had not been attacked when they chose to do so. %$* 616
so what has been achieved. %$* 616
let us be generous and acknowledge, certain things have been achieved. %$* 616
saddam hussein is gone and there isn’t a person who will be other than pleased to see him go. %$* 616
but you know, we’d like to see mugabe go without going to war in zimbabwe, we’d like to see kim jong-il in north korea go. %$* 616
we’d have liked to have seen fidel castro go. %$* 616
these are not justifications for a war. %$* 616
and yes it’s true, iraq may have a more representative government than it’s had for many years. %$* 616
but it’s not a democratic government, it’s a sectarian government of finely balanced shia and sunni, who when they’ve not been slaughtering each other in the last five years, have formed a very, very uneasy coalition. %$* 616
and yes, fewer people are being killed. %$* 616
but by god, you know, that can rise again, at any moment, for all we know. %$* 616
when you look at the price that has been paid and continues to be paid, that cannot simply be put on one side, as simply history, as mr. %$* 616
kagan implied. %$* 616
we know that first of all that the weapons of mass destruction which were the main reason for going to war, never existed. %$* 616
we know that by the admission of president bush, at least 30,000 iraqis have lost their lives, and indeed the iraqi government say over 100,000 iraqis have lost their lives in the last five years. %$* 616
we know that four million iraqis have become refugees, half of them fleeing to other countries. %$* 616
40 percent of the iraqi middle class, no longer live in iraq, and as a consequence, the job of rebuilding iraq is going to be immeasurably more difficult. %$* 616
and we know also that the coalition forces, mainly american, have lost over 4,000 lives. %$* 616
these are a heavy burden. %$* 616
but it’s not just the internal cost that is being paid, look at what has happened in terms of the wider situation. %$* 616
we know for example that the consequence of this war is that iran %$* 616
the most dangerous country in the region, has, thanks to the united states and the coalition, now become the most powerful country in the gulf. %$* 616
the iranians cannot believe their luck. %$* 616
without raising a finger, iraq which was the state that was their main competitor in the gulf, has been essentially emasculated, for the foreseeable future. %$* 616
we know that al-qaeda, who were never allowed to operate in iraq under saddam hussein, have been active, have penetrated iraq and even if they are ultimately defeated, have already radicalized sections of the community and done enormous harm. %$* 616
we know that the new iraqi government is not going to be any more pro-israeli, than any other arab state, why should they be, they are an arab government, they will share the view of the arab world. %$* 616
and we know also, that the united states in particular, has lost at this vital time its moral leadership of the world, because of having initiated this terrible conflict. %$* 616
but perhaps the most serious geopolitical problem, that has flown from this ill-judged initiative and invasion, has been that the real drama of the present time in that region, is iran’s attempts to develop nuclear weapons. %$* 616
and we know that as a consequence of the loss of authority, of the loss of leadership, that the united states in particular has experienced as a result of the iraq war, the united states has found it incredibly more difficult to get agreement either in the security council or in the international community, to take the kind of steps against iran, that would be necessary in order to encourage it to desist from its nuclear ambitions. %$* 616
so when you talk about “winning the war,” it’s not possible as general keane implied, to simply think of that in purely military terms. %$* 616
one has to look at the overall cost, and the overall benefits. %$* 616
and i conclude simply by saying this. %$* 616
at best you can say, we may be stopping losing the war, but we’re certainly not winning it. %$* 616
and i simply remind you of the words said almost 2,000 years ago, by tacitus, a great roman, when in comparable circumstances, he said, “they have created a wilderness, and they call it peace.” that is our legacy. %$* 616
thank you, sir malcolm rifkind, arguing against the motion, we have the results of your points of view with which you arrived for this debate, they are rather lopsided. %$* 13
those of you who are for the motion, that “america is finally winning the war in iraq,” represent 20 percent of you, 54 percent of you are against the motion, and twenty-six percent of you are undecided. %$* 13
and again, the point of the evening is to see the degree to which those numbers can be moved by the quality of our debate. %$* 13
now we’re going to move into the mix it up section of the program, and at this point i’d like you to begin formulating the questions that you would like to ask. %$* 13
i know that there are some journalists that would like to ask questions. %$* 13
when they are called upon we would prefer that you identify yourselves, and your organization. %$* 13
the rest of you may remain yourselves, or remain anonymous. %$* 13
we have microphones moving through the hall, and once again to remind you to please hold the microphone very close to your mouth. %$* 13
but, i want to start with the question to charles ferguson. %$* 13
charles, i heard you outlining, in some detail, why going to war in the first place, perhaps, was a mistake, and why the war was prosecuted badly in its first stages, which is a separate question from, now going forward, is the us winning, or can the us win? %$* 13
and i want to ask you what would be victory from your point of view, putting aside whether the war was a mistake in the first place. %$* 13
well, i think we’ve, i think we’ve reached the point at which a victory by any meaningful standard is no longer possible. %$* 555
i think that we’re simply now trying to reach a situation that represents some minimal level of stability and some reasonable degree to which our enormous mistakes have been redressed or stabilized. %$* 555
the reason that i mentioned the way we conducted the occupation, is that the enormity of those mistakes and their consequences are going to be with us for decades— %$* 555
well, what would have been victory, is more my question? %$* 13
oh, i'm sorry. %$* 555
if indeed iraq had been stabilized, if there had been, as almost every pre-war advisory study recommended, if there had been a larger number of troops, if there had been a large number of arabic speakers, if there had been a large international constabulary force, if the country had had a transitional period of martial law, and then after that gave way to, or was turned into something from a full democracy, which i think that most analysts think was quite unrealistic, but a soft dictatorship, something more like egypt, say. %$* 555
then that would have been, if not a victory, something that would certainly not have been a complete, unmitigated disaster. %$* 555
fred kagan, did you hear in that answer any benchmarks that you think are, are in the process of being hit? %$* 13
i'm troubled by the notion that you can simply dismiss the entire question of whether we’re winning or not by saying that the sum cost is already so high that nothing we could do could conceivably make it worthwhile. %$* 615
which is rather an intellectual cop out in my opinion. %$* 615
it strikes me that, um, one still has to ask the question, what is the situation that we face, and what are the probabilities of obtaining our objectives? %$* 615
i would say, although i'm fully in agreement with you about the mistakes that were made, i believe that we have actually obtained many of the goals that you’ve just laid out. %$* 615
we clearly have a disagreement about the facts. %$* 615
i do believe that iraq is being stabilized. %$* 615
with all respect, sir malcolm, i do not think that it is likely that you will see violence suddenly explode again, unbeknownst to us. %$* 615
because when you make it your mission to go around iraq on a regular basis, and to see what’s going on in the particulars, rather than having this conversation from thirty thousand feet about sunni and shia who don’t like each other and are killing each other, and so forth, what you will see is that violence in a particular area results from circumstances in a particular area, there are larger issues of course, but it is astonishing how fractal the complexity of this country is. %$* 615
and the fact that, what i would like to do is have a conversation with you region by region, area by area, and talk about what had been generating violence, why it’s not there anymore, and why i think that it will not be coming back anytime soon in that form. %$* 615
that's how life really works. %$* 615
and that is what we see on the ground. %$* 615
and we see a government forming that is increasingly seen as legitimate by its people, which is astonishing. %$* 615
we see elections coming up that have galvanized and excited the iraqi people like few things before. %$* 615
and the astonishing thing is having spoken with iraqi political leaders, sunni, shia, and kurds, they all think that efforts will be made to rig the elections. %$* 615
they all think that some of those efforts will succeed, and they all expect to abide by the results of the elections. %$* 615
in my mind, that’s a very healthy understanding of what democracy is likely to be like. %$* 615
fred, let me bring, sir malcolm, it sounds like you were contradicted there. %$* 13
could you, i just want to ask that you sit a little bit more— %$* 13
sure. %$* 616
mr. %$* 616
kagan claims that winning the war is because the fighting may be coming to an end. %$* 616
there has never been a war in the history of mankind that does not eventually come to an end as the people involved exhaust themselves. %$* 616
and let us accept that al qaeda is not going to be the victor in this war, although they’ve already been responsible for many people’s deaths. %$* 616
the point that i have to keep emphasizing is that the, the sheer trauma, the sheer disaster that iraq has been for the last five years wasn’t just predictable, it was predicted. %$* 616
if you go into a country and destroy its government without understanding the nature of that society, and if you remove an existing regime, you create a political vacuum. %$* 616
and in a situation where shia and sunni have been enemies for hundreds of years, it was inevitable that there was going to be this outburst of sectarian conflict. %$* 616
if the united states and the united kingdom did not understand that or did not accept that, then they're even more culpable. %$* 616
so, to say that now we may be in a situation where the fighting may be slowly coming to an end, and to see that as winning the war, as if somehow we can simply ignore what has come before— %$* 616
general jack keane— %$* 13
it does not bear credibility. %$* 616
general jack keane, for the motion. %$* 13
i think coming to an end is a condition that enables us to make political, and eventually economic progress. %$* 614
and that is why it’s so important, because we could not do that with the hell and chaos that was taking place in that country. %$* 614
the political progress is dramatically real. %$* 614
if you just listen to what he shia dominated government that sir malcolm just wipes away as, as not having any intention of building a better iraq, this government has passed a de-baathification law which changes the very social fabric of life in iraq. %$* 614
it’s equivalent to our civil rights legislation, which took us a hundred years past the end of the civil war. %$* 614
it permits the sunnis to participate in the full fabric of life where they were denied that participation by paul bremer and our policy back in 2003.the shia dominated government passed an amnesty law which will free thousands of sunnis from jail, who were trying to kill that government and return to power themselves. %$* 614
they have done that. %$* 614
why have they don’t that? %$* 614
why have they made that decision? %$* 614
they made that decision because they know that they have to reconcile with the sunnis and with those who wanted to regain power if they're going to have a future. %$* 614
that is a courageous decision that they’ve made, even given the limited political experience that many of these leaders have had who have been thrust into these positions in the last three years as, where there was thirty-five years of autocratic repression in this, in this country. %$* 614
that is dramatic change that is taking place in iraq, and it has to give you a sense of hope. %$* 614
our objectives are pretty clear, and we’re well on our way to achieving them. %$* 614
we want a government in iraq that is elected by its people. %$* 614
that has already taken place, and will be reinforced by the provincial elections which will further defuse that, and make it even a more powerful political model. %$* 614
there will be also national elections in 2000, at the end of 2009.we want a country that is stable and secure and capable of protecting its people. %$* 614
and that is taking place, and is not a threat to its neighbors. %$* 614
we do not want it to be a haven for radicalism in the region, to be sure. %$* 614
and that has been rid of. %$* 614
they came there because of our presence, to be sure, but also saddam hussein attracts radicalism. %$* 614
and i'm not re-fighting why we went into the war, i'm trying to deal with what we have here, and the opportunity that is front of us in terms of what our realistic objectives are. %$* 614
we have a country that wants to be aligned with us, that wants a strategic political relationship with us, that crosses education, political, cultural, educational ties. %$* 614
they do not want that kind of relation with the iranians, they want it with the united states of america. %$* 614
therefore, we will have the opportunity to have that kind of a strategic relationship with a duly elected government, the only government of its kind in the region, an arab-muslim country that has a duly elected government, and is aligned with the united states, and is a clear buffer against a threat in that region, which is radicalism, and particularly in the iranians. %$* 614
it already is a buffer, and it will be a greater one as this country continues to mature. %$* 614
general, let me bring in charles ferguson. %$* 13
charles ferguson, general keane just said we want a government that is elected by its people, and we have that. %$* 13
do you dismiss that? %$* 13
i don't entirely dismiss it. %$* 555
there is some degree of reality to iraq’s democracy. %$* 555
but a few points. %$* 555
there are many countries in the world which hold elections, sometimes even elections that kind of mean something, zimbabwe for example. %$* 555
transparency international hasn’t announced its 2008 ratings yet. %$* 555
in 2007, the most recent year for which we have available, transparency international rates countries on its corruption index, by their level of national corruption. %$* 555
iraq was rated number one hundred and seventy eight out of one hundred and eighty countries. %$* 555
and most of the people with whom i speak, with great regret, i have not been back to iraq since mid-2006 when i was there for the film. %$* 555
but, i stay in touch with many people, and just about everybody with whom i speak says that the corruption problem has gotten notably worse since 2007 and continues to get worse, and this society is really, in many ways, approaching breakdown, even though by some measures, some very real, significant measures, it is improving. %$* 555
but if you're a woman in iraq— %$* 555
well, just a minute, jack keane explained a situation where people couldn't go to school, they're going to school again, they couldn't go shopping, they're going shopping again, which does not sound like a society that’s breaking down, it sounds like a society that’s knitting together. %$* 13
i think both are happening at the same time. %$* 555
but, for example, have any of the refugees returned? %$* 555
no. %$* 555
in fact, there is— %$* 555
yes, they have— %$* 615
a very small number— %$* 555
that’s fred kagan interrupting. %$* 13
there is still a net out-flux of ten thousand per month. %$* 555
what about that, fred kagan. %$* 13
i'm sorry, that’s just false. %$* 615
refugees have returned. %$* 615
if you say, have any refugees returned, the answer is yes. %$* 615
a tiny number— %$* 555
if you say— %$* 615
on a net basis, they are still leaving. %$* 555
are people leaving, that’s fine, we can have that conversation. %$* 615
but there have been refugees returning, there have been idp’s returning as well. %$* 615
this is a process that has been, that is ongoing, and i'm sorry, you have to, you have to recognize that. %$* 615
this is not the case where people are still fleeing the countries in droves, and that’s all that’s going on. %$* 615
you’ve got movement back and forth. %$* 615
one of the most important things that’s happened is that key leaders in anbar, who had fled because of the al qaeda violence, have returned. %$* 615
that was a key element of the sakwa they have come back and taken up their traditional positions in society, which is one of the things that has allowed the creation of a new political dynamic in what had been the hot bed of the sunni insurgency, and they are now participating in the iraqi political process. %$* 615
those returnees may be small in number, but they are incredibly important for the future of the country. %$* 615
as your moderator i'm hearing not just a difference of opinion on interpreting the facts, i'm hearing a difference of opinion on what the facts are. %$* 13
for example, the question of electricity, either there is more electricity than before, or there isn't. %$* 13
there is. %$* 615
which is it? %$* 13
there is. %$* 615
there is. %$* 615
hold on, let me get this in perspective. %$* 616
no one— %$* 616
sir malcolm rifkind speaking. %$* 13
no one is, i think, suggesting that there is more electricity than there was before this war began. %$* 616
all that mr. %$* 616
kagan and general keane are saying is the war which we were responsible for creating, which destroyed iraq’s infrastructure, which destroyed its schools and its hospitals and its electricity and drove millions of people abroad, all they are able even to claim is it’s now beginning to go back to what it was before we started this war. %$* 616
now, if that is the culmination of this terrible five years, it’s not exactly something we can be proud of. %$* 616
that’s not what we’re saying— %$* 615
fred kagan— %$* 13
and that is not the case. %$* 615
electrical generation and transmission in iraq is higher, in fact significantly higher than it was before the war. %$* 615
it is, in fact, that is true, it is, i'm sorry, i did make one misstatement, it’s about thirty percent higher than it was before the war. %$* 555
charles ferguson. %$* 13
most other indicators, most other quality of life and infrastructural indicators, the availability of water, the availability of sewage treatment, the availability of education, et cetera, remain enormously below their pre-war levels. %$* 555
we have several hands up, and i want to bring the audience into the conversation. %$* 13
again, my reminder, please perfect the art of the well-asked question, and hold your microphone quite close to your mouth, about one fist away. %$* 13
a gentleman who is now standing up %$* 13
the microphone being brought to you. %$* 13
about halfway up the amphitheater. %$* 13
i thought this was supposed to be a debate with two people speaking for the motion and two against, but we’ve had four people speaking for the motion. %$* 9
the point is that mr. %$* 9
ferguson and sir malcolm have said, you know, that things are getting better. %$* 9
and if that’s not a step towards winning, i don’t know what is. %$* 9
i think that mr. %$* 9
ferguson and mr. %$* 9
malcolm are debating not a question that’s asked tonight, that’s on the board. %$* 9
they're debating a question— %$* 9
so what, formulate a question— %$* 13
and the question i want to ask them is, do you have any argument to show that america is not winning the war right now? %$* 9
sir malcolm? %$* 13
if you mean winning the war means gradually getting domination over the insurgency, if that’s all you define as winning the war, i happily acknowledge that. %$* 616
and i said earlier, all wars eventually come to an end, and if the world’s great super power is not able to beat some insurgents in iraq in military terms, it would be a very strange situation. %$* 616
but winning the war means actually achieving the reasons why you went to war in the first place. %$* 616
and by that definition, which is the only meaningful definition, no, we are not winning the war, it remains a total disaster for the people of iraq, as the hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives, or who have been injured in this war, would happily testify if they were alive and able to do so. %$* 616
i thought that both of us made it clear that we thought that this war had discredited the united states in the mid-east and the entire world, had left iran stronger, had pinned down the american military in iraq so that it was able to deal with afghanistan and pakistan and a number of other issues. %$* 555
i thought we had made that fairly clear, actually. %$* 555
question from the audience. %$* 13
i’d like to ask the, for the motion— %$* 9
can you put that mic really, that’s it, thank you. %$* 13
i’d like to ask the for the motion group to comment on some of the scary statistics around the flight of professional and middle class, and what do you see as the facts and the reality today of where the country stands. %$* 9
and then how does that evolve or correct itself going forward as the country builds? %$* 9
now that’s a question. %$* 13
jack keane. %$* 13
well actually, i'm going to start off. %$* 615
fred is going to start off. %$* 614
fred kagan, his partner, will go first. %$* 13
i, it’s interesting, i just had the, this similar conversation with a senior iraqi military leader last night, in fact. %$* 615
and he made a point that the flight of the middle class in iraq, and the technocratic class began, in fact, with the rise of saddam, when you had a tremendous number of highly educated people flee the country. %$* 615
it certainly was exacerbated as the baathist elements and the sunni community, elements of the sunni community, and also shia community, there were shia baathists, we tend to forget that, fled. %$* 615
are those people coming back? %$* 615
on the whole, no, they're not coming back. %$* 615
will they? %$* 615
it remains to be seen. %$* 615
what’s going on is the formation of a new government in iraq. %$* 615
it certainly was set back by mistakes that we made early on, the excessively harsh de-baathification policy. %$* 615
on the other hand, there is an analogy to the de-nazification strategy after world war ii, and there was a lot of controversy about that. %$* 615
if you want the people who will administer the country efficiently, then going back to some of the people who were involved in the previous dictatorship might make sense. %$* 615
although i would point out that that was the most corrupt and inefficient and ineffective dictatorships that there has ever been at everything except keeping itself in power and threatening its neighbors. %$* 615
and so it’s not as though there was exactly good governance in iraq before 2003, and it’s not as though there was a large cadre of government officials in iraq before 2003 who you would have wanted to see in senior positions now. %$* 615
nevertheless, excessive de-baathification set the process back. %$* 615
what we are seeing now is the construction of a new iraqi society. %$* 615
this will take a long time. %$* 615
and i think part of the problem that we have in this discussion is that we tend to conflate the question, are we winning, with the question, have we won? %$* 615
the truth of the matter is, we are winning in the sense that, we respect, sir malcolm, not just in the matter of military arena, but in respect to politics, and also now finally economic development, we are moving in the right direction, we do see the formation of an iraqi bureaucratic class. %$* 615
we do see the development of iraqi technocrats, small in number, ineffective in some respects, still learning the ropes as they develop a new system, but we are making progress. %$* 615
we will have achieved, when we have achieved the aim of working this all out, we won't be winning, we will have won. %$* 615
let me add to that. %$* 614
jack keane. %$* 13
because some of you may be thinking about that. %$* 614
when we talk about a long struggle in iraq, we do not mean a long troop presence in iraq. %$* 614
all of us believe, strongly, that we will reduce our forces in 2009, we’ll even more dramatically reduce them in 2010, and i have held the view, if you put maliki’s number on the table, number and date on the table with obama’s, mccain’s, and petraeus’s, they wouldn't be that far apart. %$* 614
and i think that’s where we are, to be quite frank about it. %$* 614
in terms of our combat forces coming out. %$* 614
because their presence is needed right now to see through the political process, to make certain that these provincial elections are not maligned, and to make certain that the national election is not maligned. %$* 614
we don’t have those large forces there because of the insurgency or because of the al qaeda. %$* 614
we want to make certain that the political process is moving forward, and the us and coalition presence in iraq has been the glue that has been holding things together. %$* 614
it is a myth that has been perpetuated, and people who perpetuate it don’t know the iraqis when they say, by pulling our forces away, somehow that would be a catalyst and a call to action for the iraqis to do something that they're not capable of doing while we’re there. %$* 614
we have been the catalyst and the glue that have helped them, and our presence has been very important. %$* 614
and that presence is going to dramatically change in terms-- %$* 614
it already has in terms of casualties, that’ll continue to go down to almost nothing. %$* 614
and also the numbers of our troops will dramatically go down over time as well. %$* 614
i just want to clear that up, where you have long term political objectives in iraq, that does not mean that we’re going to have combat troops in iraq fighting in iraq for years to come. %$* 614
sir malcolm, i see you taking notes on that, do you want to respond? %$* 13
well, i think that there are always going to be good consequences of bad wars, just as there are sometimes bad consequences of good wars. %$* 616
what you’ve got to do is come to an honest judgement as to where the balance lies. %$* 616
have the sacrifices been worthwhile, of the iraq people, of the american people, of the coalition forces, but particularly of the iraqis. %$* 616
is the net effect of this terrible five years something that was worth doing in the first place? %$* 616
if the answer is, no, it wasn’t, then the fact that there have been some benefits, sure, that always happens even in the worst wars for the worst reasons. %$* 616
your comment on sacrifices raises for me the question of the price that has been paid in blood. %$* 13
and i want to ask, with as much sensitivity as possible, and as much honor for the families of those who have lost soldiers, charles ferguson, did those men die for nothing? %$* 13
i think it’s worse than that, i think it’s much worse than that. %$* 555
i think that history is going to record george bush as one of the most horrifically arrogant, rigid, stupid, inhumane morons we have ever %$* 555
it, look, in my film, six minutes into my film there is a clip of a very intelligent, honest, accomplished man who was the chairman of the national intelligence council from 2003 to 2005.and the first thing that he says is that what he found the most revealing, he began, on his own initiative, not asked by the administration, not asked by the president, he began performing intelligence estimates of the insurgency. %$* 555
and he gave them to the highest level of the administration. %$* 555
and he said that what he found most revealing was that president bush not only had not read the estimate, but had not even read the one page executive summary. %$* 555
would victory vindicate those deaths. %$* 13
victory would. %$* 555
in 1972, when he was first visiting china, henry kissinger asked zhou enlai whether in zhou enlai’s view the french revolution had been a success. %$* 555
and zhou enlai’s response was, it’s too early to tell. %$* 555
now, by that standard, maybe we’re winning. %$* 555
fred kagan, can you take on the question of the sacrifice? %$* 13
i’d actually like to surprise the audience by agreeing with the last remark that mr. %$* 615
ferguson made. %$* 615
it is too soon to tell. %$* 615
if we win the war, then the sacrifice will not have been in vain. %$* 615
i think it’s fair to say that no soldier who sacrifices his life, or her life for their country, makes a vain sacrifice. %$* 615

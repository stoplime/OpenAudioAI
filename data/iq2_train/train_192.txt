and to launch, with opening remarks that help frame the issue for us, i'd like to introduce the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
welcome. %$* 1
well, "men are finished," mmm. %$* 1
i for one hope not. %$* 1
but there does seem to be a lot of evidence that we are. %$* 1
traditional male attributes like competitiveness, aggression and risk taking are discouraged in-- %$* 1
in classrooms and derided in popular culture. %$* 1
as a society, our values seem to be shifting toward the traditional feminine virtues of empathy, cooperation, emotional intelligence. %$* 1
increasingly, men are not taking the responsibility for parenting, and women are proceeding on their own. %$* 1
at the top of the cognitive pyramid, women are now a majority in our universities, graduate schools of law, business and medicine. %$* 1
and at the bottom, the high-paid jobs men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in factories have fallen victim to globalization. %$* 1
men are overrepresented in prisons and in the ranks of the unemployed. %$* 1
and underrepresented in higher education. %$* 1
project these trends forward for a couple of decade, and the future looks pretty bleak for men. %$* 1
on the other hand, and there always is another hand in our debates, men still hold positions of overwhelming dominance as ceos of our largest companies and financial institutions, as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes, the microsofts, oracles, googles, facebooks, as top elected officials in both the federal and state governments, as the most influential artists and writers, as scientists with breakthroughs worthy of nobel prizes and on and on. %$* 1
so where do you come out tonight on this question, are men finished? %$* 1
the answer may depend on how you interpret the question. %$* 1
what we meant but couldn't say in three provocative words, is whether we're at a tipping point where women are likely to achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past, or whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant, perhaps, but hardly fundamental. %$* 1
well, we have an extraordinary group of panelists to help you make that decision, and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them, and to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
and i'm going to introduce our debaters in turn. %$* 13
and when i say their names, i'd appreciate it if you could applaud for their names. %$* 13
but first i'd like to ask for one more round of applause for mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
true or false, men are finished? %$* 13
that's what we are here to debate, another verbal matchup from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we are at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
men are finished. %$* 13
two teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it. %$* 13
these teams include dan abrams, my colleague at abc news, where he is chief legal analyst and author of "man down," which gives proof that women are unequivocally better than men. %$* 13
his debating partner is hanna rosin. %$* 13
she is a senior editor at the atlantic and founding editor of xx, a woman-focused section of the online magazine, slate. %$* 13
nothing like a packed house. %$* 13
opposing them at the facing table, christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
she is a philosophy professor and author of who stole feminism? %$* 13
and the war against boys. %$* 13
her partner, david zinczenko, executive vice president and editor in chief of men's health magazine. %$* 13
now, this is the debate. %$* 13
it is a contest. %$* 13
one team will win, and one team will lose in this joust of ideas. %$* 13
and you, our live audience here at the skirball center will be functioning as our judges. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards to register where you stand on this motion, "men are finished." and the team that has changed the most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go to your preliminary vote. %$* 13
if you go to these key pads at your seat, they have numbers one through three along the top row. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, "men are finished," push number one. %$* 13
if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and what we're going to do is tabulate those. %$* 13
and at the end of the debate after the second vote, i'll present both numbers. %$* 13
and reminding you again the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so our motion is, "men are finished." and now onto round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
and i'd like to introduce first for the motion, hanna rosin. %$* 13
she is an award-winning journalist for slate and the atlantic. %$* 13
her 2010 cover story, which was titled, "the end of men," provoked a fire storm of responses. %$* 13
she is now writing a book expanding on her theory that men are losing their dominance. %$* 13
and as a matter of fact, she went to high school, stuyvesant, a few blocks away from here where i understand you were a debater? %$* 13
i was a debater, and i'm hoping i can channel that inner nerd tonight and bring it right back again. %$* 518
did-- %$* 13
did you beat the boys a lot? %$* 13
we beat everybody. %$* 518
but my partner was a boy, so i don't know if that counts. %$* 518
ladies and gentlemen, hanna rosin. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome you all to this debate tonight. %$* 518
i'd even like to welcome the men to the debate tonight although of course i pity you. %$* 518
just kidding. %$* 518
before i dive in, i just want to say-- %$* 518
i just want to start with a definition. %$* 518
what do we mean by men are finished? %$* 518
we'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an inevitable future. %$* 518
what i mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have to prove that there are no male geniuses, that there's no more male ceos, that bill gates and steve jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any minute going to be rounded up and locked up as-- %$* 518
only to be released every once in a while as sex slaves. %$* 518
that would be-- %$* 518
that would be a preposterous standard. %$* 518
maybe it sounds good to you guys. %$* 518
but what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to. %$* 518
we are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically. %$* 518
i'll start with the fundamentals. %$* 518
in 2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force. %$* 518
this is kind of an amazing fact. %$* 518
as recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of you might remember. %$* 518
now she is the majority of the work force. %$* 518
if you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools. %$* 518
and last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all american managers. %$* 518
now, how are men doing these days? %$* 518
they're doing very, very badly. %$* 518
the annual income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going. %$* 518
right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever existed. %$* 518
when larry summers was recently asked by the new york times what keeps him up at night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of those things. %$* 518
what he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences. %$* 518
now, why is this happening? %$* 518
the very simple answer is college. %$* 518
most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple. %$* 518
it's just a college degree. %$* 518
but women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees than men. %$* 518
for every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. %$* 518
so why are women getting more college degrees? %$* 518
it's not that women are smarter because they're not smarter. %$* 518
these days, men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and english. %$* 518
but women have something. %$* 518
some sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social intelligence. %$* 518
it's some special formula that's required for success these days, which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men. %$* 518
and this is a very new thing. %$* 518
now, i imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college. %$* 518
but then they're going to say so what? %$* 518
women are goody goodies, then they go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else. %$* 518
but this is, of course, completely preposterous. %$* 518
for one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you already see the results in the economy. %$* 518
you already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30.and that's really, really new. %$* 518
also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something that's brand new. %$* 518
and also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later. %$* 518
so now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture. %$* 518
we've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at slate calls the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack. %$* 518
and so we see him in the judd apatow movies, we see him in the bud light commercials. %$* 518
he's sitting around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to do with his life, he's still wearing keds and a band t-shirt even though he's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college. %$* 518
i just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new tv season. %$* 518
the theme for this tv season was called by tv guide the emasculation of men, and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames. %$* 518
one of the guys in the sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an mba from purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot. %$* 518
so this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days. %$* 518
now we're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity. %$* 518
lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets. %$* 518
dave zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine, men's health. %$* 518
upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression. %$* 518
the very first issue of playboy called women people who crush man's adventurous free loving spirit. %$* 518
these days they seem to flaunt male insecurity. %$* 518
men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes. %$* 518
if you look at the back at the 1986 sexiest man alive, you'll see mark harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man. %$* 518
these days the men are waxing and primping more than i have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of anthony weiner. %$* 518
now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology industry. %$* 518
i have a few things to say to that. %$* 518
first of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school. %$* 518
it's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished. %$* 518
you're also likely to hear about the fortune 500 list and at the echelons of hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top. %$* 518
i hear this argument on nearly every panel that i'm on and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside- down overnight. %$* 518
but the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why you should vote for us. %$* 518
thank you, hanna rosin. %$* 13
"men are finished" is our motion and now here to speak against the motion i'd like to introduce christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
she's a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute. %$* 13
she is a critic of radical feminism and the author of the war against boys and also who stole feminism? %$* 13
does the answer to that question figure in to the argument you're going to make here tonight? %$* 13
oh, actually it does, in who stole feminism i argued against a very ferocious form of male bashing feminism and in favor of a feminism that affirmed friendship and equality and mutual respect between the sexes and i'm going to talk a lot about that tonight. %$* 519
all right. %$* 13
here we go. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, christina hoff sommers. %$* 13
first of all, men are not finished. %$* 519
yes, yes, indeed, women are joining men as partners in running the world but they're not replacing them. %$* 519
women are flourishing in ways which are unprecedented, exciting, glorious. %$* 519
but men have hardly vanished from the limelight. %$* 519
i mean, after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns, men are still more likely than women to run for political office, start businesses, file patents, write editorials, tell jokes. %$* 519
they conduct the orchestras. %$* 519
they direct the great movies. %$* 519
they blow up things. %$* 519
now, i admit blowing up things is problematic. %$* 519
i wish they would do less of it. %$* 519
men commit most acts of wanton violence. %$* 519
but, at the same time, it usually takes other men to stop them. %$* 519
the “males are in decline” crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building women, happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy. %$* 519
they point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators, more social workers, veterinarians, dance therapists, teachers. %$* 519
the problem is that you can’t sustain a network of nurturers and communicators without someone paying for it. %$* 519
you’re still going to need ambitious, hard-driven innovators, manufacturers, engineers, construction workers, along with police officers, firefighters and the military. %$* 519
now, we’re told that toughness and assertiveness, those are obsolete, fit for another age, not the 21st century. %$* 519
that’s absurd. %$* 519
it’s worse than absurd. %$* 519
it borders on being ungrateful and even elitist. %$* 519
it ignores the actions and virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and debate whether men are in decline. %$* 519
it reminds me of a quote by-- %$* 519
well, attributed to george orwell. %$* 519
orwell allegedly said, “we sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf.” well, the world is still dangerous, and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some women who are willing to fight and die to protect us. %$* 519
now, hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid, but she says, quote, “men’s hold on power in elite circles is loosening.” loosening? %$* 519
yes, of course. %$* 519
i agree. %$* 519
and i welcome it. %$* 519
but it’s not evidence of a female takeover. %$* 519
i mean, just think about it. %$* 519
women have amazing talents. %$* 519
they can be as dazzling as men when they set their minds to it. %$* 519
but the sexes are equal. %$* 519
but they exercise their equality in different ways. %$* 519
consider science and technology. %$* 519
women now hold a majority of college degrees, and they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, biology. %$* 519
it’s quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these fields and, indeed, very exciting to behold. %$* 519
they’re just as competitive as men in those fields, if not more. %$* 519
but those numbers don’t hold in other fields. %$* 519
math, technology, engineering-- %$* 519
those are fields where men prevail by huge numbers. %$* 519
“and give them time,” says hanna. %$* 519
“women have only just begun, and that women are in ascendancy. %$* 519
they’re going to gain momentum.” where is it? %$* 519
i see no sign of it. %$* 519
according to a recent study by the commerce department, women’s numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10 years. %$* 519
i mean, if hanna were right, these trends-- %$* 519
we would begin to see women taking over, or at least showing some progress. %$* 519
we see no progress, very little progress in those fields. %$* 519
now, ask yourself, is technology finished? %$* 519
is engineering finished? %$* 519
is the military finished? %$* 519
are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a roofer, a logger-- %$* 519
are those finished? %$* 519
now, it’s true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble. %$* 519
and i agree very much with hanna that this is a matter of grave concern. %$* 519
girls do better than boys in school. %$* 519
they get better grades. %$* 519
they score higher on reading and writing tests. %$* 519
they’re more likely to go to college. %$* 519
the reason for girls’ educational success, they’re complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and cultural differences. %$* 519
teenage girls, for example, tend to pay attention better than teenage boys. %$* 519
but instead of declaring men finished because of their educational deficits, we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys and young men, and more conducive to their success. %$* 519
why are we even having this debate about men’s demise? %$* 519
the reason is we are living in an era you could call “waw,” women are wonderful. %$* 519
it’s a phenomenon that’s been identified by some psychologists. %$* 519
and it used to be fashionable to celebrate men’s superiority over women when women were truly the second sex. %$* 519
fortunately, those chauvinist days are long gone. %$* 519
today, a new kind of reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy, female chauvinism. %$* 519
magazines, tv shows, yes, sitcoms claim, you know, the endless heroics about girl power, "you go, girl," claiming that women are better at everything. %$* 519
women are better leaders, women are better communicators, all around better human beings. %$* 519
i saw one-story that said women have better orgasms than men. %$* 519
the rules of the waw game make it impossible for them to-- %$* 519
to win, because if women do something better than men, that's evidence of their superiority. %$* 519
if men outperform women, that's proof of discrimination and the continuing male culture. %$* 519
what you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the waw phenomenon. %$* 519
the idea that men are finished is crazy. %$* 519
men and women complement each other. %$* 519
we are not separate teams competing for a trophy. %$* 519
this is not a zero sum competition. %$* 519
we're dance partners like fred astaire and ginger rogers. %$* 519
our fates are inextricably tied together. %$* 519
if one is in trouble, so is the other. %$* 519
several years ago the hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house. %$* 519
they wanted to manufacture-- %$* 519
they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls. %$* 519
the girls came in, and the boys. %$* 519
the girls played constructively with the dolls. %$* 519
the kids took the dolls and played house. %$* 519
the boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof. %$* 519
and the hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation: boys and girls are different. %$* 519
i'm almost finished. %$* 519
i'm almost finished. %$* 519
thank you. %$* 519
christina the sum of your time is up. %$* 13
i'm almost finished. %$* 519
i've got to-- %$* 13
i've got to-- %$* 13
i'm almost finished. %$* 519
i-- %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i can't let you. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 519
pleasure. %$* 13
a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening statements of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion, men are finished. %$* 13
we have heard two of the opening statements and now onto the third. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce dan abrams. %$* 13
he is chief legal analyst for abc news. %$* 13
he is also the author of a book whose title is a lot of fun to read. %$* 13
it's called "man down: proof beyond a reasonable doubt that women are better cops, drivers, gamblers, spies, world leaders, beer tasters, hedge fund managers and just about everything else." i notice that you don't say women are better legal analysts. %$* 13
have you raised the bar for men with your performance? %$* 13
no, no, no. %$* 520
there's just the-- %$* 520
the obvious example of the woman who is a better legal analyst. %$* 520
of course, there's nancy grace who's-- %$* 520
ladies and gentlemen, dan abrams. %$* 13
my frequent opponent. %$* 520
the heck did dan abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority? %$* 520
did he do it to meet women? %$* 520
did he-- %$* 520
did he do it to pander? %$* 520
you know, it's always frustrating for me when i'm asked about a single reason why i wrote the book. %$* 520
i did it for both reasons, and it's worked incredibly well. %$* 520
now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, "man down," far more attention than it ever would have received. %$* 520
i made a case based on evidence and men's rights groups and others have attacked me, saying, "he didn't use the scientific method in this book." look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort. %$* 520
so i separate it into two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which i think truly prove female superiority. %$* 520
can i definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men? %$* 520
i presented evidence. %$* 520
i presented studies, research. %$* 520
but certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters. %$* 520
so let's put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important. %$* 520
hanna talked about women as students. %$* 520
they'll be better educated. %$* 520
they'll navigate tough economies better. %$* 520
they'll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation. %$* 520
but i don't know. %$* 520
what about politics, finance, taking care of the planet? %$* 520
these are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas. %$* 520
let's start with politics. %$* 520
women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the percentage of the population. %$* 520
in terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent of women voted. %$* 520
58 percent of men. %$* 520
in 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the ballots, by the way, 66-62. same thing in midterm elections in 2010. 53 percent of those who voted were female. %$* 520
but wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women-- %$* 520
sorry, more men. %$* 520
four out of five being elected are men. %$* 520
in fact, in 2010, women gained no senate seats. %$* 520
and for the first time in 30 years, lost house seats. %$* 520
this is true for now. %$* 520
but once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not-- %$* 520
it cannot continue. %$* 520
men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in congress. %$* 520
the american journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their male counterparts. %$* 520
women sponsored more bills. %$* 520
they cosponsored many more bills. %$* 520
they attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues. %$* 520
in addition, two ohio state political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall. %$* 520
and as political leaders and police officers, for that matter-- %$* 520
you mentioned police officers-- %$* 520
women are less corruptible. %$* 520
two major international studies, one at the world bank development research group, one from williams college analyzed data from dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey. %$* 520
they took a count of corruption levels within the countries. %$* 520
they took a count of culture, religion, education. %$* 520
the results were clear. %$* 520
the more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature. %$* 520
so what the heck's going on? %$* 520
why aren't there more women? %$* 520
i think a 2008 pew research study explains it all. %$* 520
they surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior. %$* 520
honesty, overwhelmingly women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied. %$* 520
the only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness. %$* 520
in that same study, though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders. %$* 520
similar results when it came to newscasters. %$* 520
a rigorous study done, male and female news casters reading the exact same message. %$* 520
the participants agreed that when it came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible. %$* 520
and yet when those same people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men. %$* 520
there is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions. %$* 520
now, finance. %$* 520
you don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance. %$* 520
2009 and 2010, wall street journal and new york times published articles entitled, "for mother's day, give her the reins to the portfolio" and "how men's overconfidence hurts them as investors." both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money. %$* 520
female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent. %$* 520
business week reported that when the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men. %$* 520
yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers. %$* 520
maybe they have to work harder to get there. %$* 520
maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game. %$* 520
but in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves. %$* 520
and all other things equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman. %$* 520
finally, new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet. %$* 520
they recycle more. %$* 520
they're more likely to be green. %$* 520
they eat less meat. %$* 520
they take shorter trips. %$* 520
in part because they give and follow better directions than men. %$* 520
they take public transportation more. %$* 520
they are also better and safer bus drivers. %$* 520
they save gas by speeding less. %$* 520
they make more eco purchases. %$* 520
heck, god has decided that men are finished. %$* 520
between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men. %$* 520
so bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas? %$* 520
three reasons: married or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the overconfidence of men; and three, sexism. %$* 520
when number one may not ever change for certain, number two and three will. %$* 520
they must. %$* 520
and then us men are in big trouble. %$* 520
thank you, dan abrams. %$* 13
"men are finished," that is our motion and now here to speak against the motion, david zinczenko, who is executive vice president and editor in chief of men's health magazine. %$* 13
he is editorial director of both women's health and prevention magazine and he's a bestselling author. %$* 13
and men's health-- %$* 13
it's about fitness, it's about technology, it's about handling your finances, so if men were going down the tubes, you would have your finger on the pulse of all of these-- %$* 13
we would know, john. %$* 521
men aren't finished. %$* 521
dan may be finished. %$* 521
but men aren't finished. %$* 521
ladies and gentlemen, david zinczenko. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 521
thank you, john, and thank you, dan. %$* 521
i want you to vote against this proposition, against this misguided motion because it's preposterous. %$* 521
men can't possibly be finished because as all of you know, when men are finished, they roll over immediately and go to sleep. %$* 521
that's not happening. %$* 521
clearly men are not rolling over. %$* 521
now, they will have you believe that, that is the case. %$* 521
it's not, if anything they continue to do what they have always done, invent new technology-- %$* 521
makes them smarter-- %$* 521
lead nations, build bridges, drive corporations, yes, win elections, and to your point quite sadly, tweet pics of their genitalia to complete strangers. %$* 521
that's true. %$* 521
nothing's changed. %$* 521
now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women now outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economy continues to place greater and greater importance on education. %$* 521
and men are certainly falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession, nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men, yes. %$* 521
men make up the largest sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the majority of people who ought to be in rehab. %$* 521
and as jeff foxworthy might have put it, very few women say as their last words, "hey, watch this." it's a fact. %$* 521
testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men seven years sooner than women. %$* 521
so how can i concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must vote against this measure? %$* 521
it's simple. %$* 521
all of the statistics that my opponents will be citing tonight are indicative of a trend. %$* 521
women are beginning to catch up to men. %$* 521
but the pace of that progress is inexorably slow. %$* 521
according to the united nations women perform two-thirds of the world's work, but only earn a fraction of the world's income. %$* 521
men own 99 percent of the world's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign nations. %$* 521
now, i didn't get through all of freakonomics, admittedly, but these do not seem like winning statistics for that side. %$* 521
obviously, the other 150 million american males out there aren't particularly alarmed either. %$* 521
i don't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of this debate out there burning their jockstraps. %$* 521
men aren't finished. %$* 521
you have to vote against this motion. %$* 521
now, what's going on? %$* 521
in part it's the biological drive. %$* 521
there is a women's movement for the simple reason that women are willing to move together more as a unit. %$* 521
men are rugged individualists. %$* 521
they want to move together probably but they-- %$* 521
none is willing to stop and ask for directions. %$* 521
so that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that. %$* 521
it may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role. %$* 521
it was still men who spent those long weeks in the chilean mine. %$* 521
it’s still men who make up 90 percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours. %$* 521
it was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the world trade center. %$* 521
and while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, i personally am in awe of rupert murdoch’s wife. %$* 521
we are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership. %$* 521
even women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of masculinity. %$* 521
consider sarah palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is. %$* 521
or michele bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins. %$* 521
yes, women are making enormous gains in education. %$* 521
they now earn the majority of graduate and undergraduate degrees. %$* 521
and i feel terrible, just terrible, for bill gates and barry diller and sergey brin and mark zuckerberg and tyler perry and larry ellison and steve jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming billionaires to finish their homework. %$* 521
awful. %$* 521
it’s so tough. %$* 521
it would have been much better-- %$* 521
it would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which now belongs to-- %$* 521
you guessed it-- %$* 521
the fairer sex. %$* 521
of course, there’s self-made women billionaires-- %$* 521
oprah, martha, j.k.rowling, imaginative visions shared worldwide. %$* 521
but it’s men who flood the patent offices with their big ideas. %$* 521
and until a woman invents the next google or facebook or ipad or bass- o-matic-- %$* 521
the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes. %$* 521
so, men are driven to achieve power and influence. %$* 521
men aren’t worried about losing out to women. %$* 521
they’re still too focused on not losing out to other men. %$* 521
that’s why men are not finished. %$* 521
and it’s why you have to vote against this ridiculous proposition. %$* 521
thank you, david zinczenko. %$* 13
that concludes round one of this u.s.intelligence squared u.s.debate where the motion being debated is "men are finished." all right, so we’re going to move on to round two, and this is one of those times when i would solicit your highly spontaneous applause. %$* 13
welcome back to this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan of abc news. %$* 13
we’re at the skirball center for the performing arts at new york university. %$* 13
our motion is "men are finished," and we have two teams debating this motion. %$* 13
we have hanna rosin and dan abrams arguing for the motion that "men are finished." they’re saying that as a result of a changing economy and shifting cultural values, men who once, like it or not, were seen as the dominant sex, the bosses and the breadwinners, are now already in a deep slide to number two status. %$* 13
arguing against them, saying that men are not finished, christina hoff sommers and david zinczenko. %$* 13
they’re saying that men are doing just fine, thank you, that they still hold most of the power. %$* 13
and besides, just because women are doing better, that does not mean that men have to be doing worse. %$* 13
we’re in round two where the debaters are going to be able to talk directly to each other and take questions from you and from myself and from readers of slate who are watching this debate online. %$* 13
and i’d like to start with initially with a question to the side that’s arguing for the motion, and i think perhaps to you, hanna rosin. %$* 13
your opponents are making the case that part of the reason that the notion is afloat, that "men are finished," is because there’s an attitude about, there’s a sense that women can only be doing better if men are doing worse, that this is a zero-sum game. %$* 13
so is it? %$* 13
is it not possible for both sides to do well without this imbalance resulting? %$* 13
it is possible, but it just doesn’t work that way. %$* 518
i mean, if we can all agree that there was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over, then i think we agree that men are finished. %$* 518
so the resolution is about male dominance which we’ve taken for granted for so many tens of thousands of years. %$* 518
and so, even if you have parity, you have the end of male dominance. %$* 518
i mean, if you have women rising and catching up to men, then you no longer have male dominance. %$* 518
and so that's what i meant when i, early on, tried to define the resolution as men are finished, the era of male dominance, it's finished, which we've taken for granted for all this time. %$* 518

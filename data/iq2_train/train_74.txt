great-great-grandfather-- %$* 280
that are simply not true. %$* 280
his atheism didn't come solely from the fact that his daughter died. %$* 280
it was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the bible. %$* 280
and i think the point i would make is, let's give the religious people that at some point in history, religion was helpful, that it did make people do better things. %$* 280
but that the texts that the religions are based upon are archaic, absurd, cruel, open to interpretation. %$* 280
and frankly, there are better ways of conducting yourself in life. %$* 280
there are. %$* 280
and people like myself and anthony here, we don't find a problem with being moral without god. %$* 280
all right. %$* 13
and i don't buy in argument that we've inherited it from christianity because if you look at the sort of evolutionary world, empathy and cooperation, compassion clearly existed before god decided, for some unknown reason, %$* 280
let me take it to david wolpe to talk about this question of the text. %$* 13
and you're in an interesting position because in 2001 you gave a talk in which you actually questioned the literal truth of the exodus story. %$* 13
so you are not-- %$* 13
you are already not tied-- %$* 13
i'm not a literalist, no. %$* 279
but what i find very interesting is that the leap that matthew's making-- %$* 279
he says these texts have cruel things. %$* 279
there are better ways to behalf. %$* 279
but we're asking not would the world be better off if you rewrote the bible, but would the world be better off without the influence that religion has on religious people. %$* 279
and i tried again and again to say this is what religious people do. %$* 279
this is what religious people do. %$* 279
this is what religious people do only to get back, "but look at the terrible text." and i want to say, in response to what anthony said, i have the exact opposite experience. %$* 279
i actually think that if you believe that people are fundamentally good, and if you leave them alone, they're just going to be good, then you've never visited a playground, because my experience is when a new kid comes to the playground, the other kids don't go, "oh, look, a new child. %$* 279
let us embrace him and share our toys." actually, children have to be socialized to good. %$* 279
they do. %$* 279
and it takes a lot of work. %$* 279
if any of you are parents, do you have to tell your kid, "don't share so much, don't be so nice." no, quite the opposite. %$* 279
and that work is difficult work and constant work and that's what religious communities do. %$* 279
do they ever do harm? %$* 279
of course they sometimes do harm. %$* 279
are there texts i don't like? %$* 279
of course, but the coda to this is, this idea that religious people are thoughtless automatons that follow what the text says, does violence to everything i know about religious training, about religious leaders, about religious people, and by the way about the fact that we're having a debate like this tonight. %$* 279
let me go to the other-- %$* 13
i would like to-- %$* 280
all right, very quickly. %$* 13
because i think what he's saying is this is the viewpoint of a rabbi who does work in an affluent community in los angeles. %$* 280
both these men are very sophisticated. %$* 280
the people i met in pennsylvania, who 50 percent of them believe in creationism and are fundamentalists, are people-- %$* 280
these people, they ignore. %$* 280
they're saying we ignore their sophistication. %$* 280
i'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text. %$* 280
and if there were no religion, what would be happening in pennsylvania? %$* 13
in other words, what's the harm in the pennsylvania situation, where the school board wanted intelligent design taught as an equal alternative to evolution, you've got to specify what the harm is there. %$* 13
well, the harm is absolutely enormous, i mean, 50 percent-- %$* 280
i mean, just to be practical about it-- %$* 280
50 percent of the growth of the american economy since world war ii has come from science and technology. %$* 280
and this anti-scientism is gradually eroding america's ability to produce enterprising, educated-- %$* 280
okay, i want-- %$* 13
that's a new point that i want to take to this side, the argument that religious thinking and religious strictures limit science, galileo into the future. %$* 13
go ahead. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
first of all, if you want to make a list of the 200 greatest scientists of all time from newton, copernicus, kepler, pascal, gassindi, boyle, the list goes on, you find that the vast, vast majority of them were religious believers. %$* 201
moreover, it's not an accident that science did not develop universally. %$* 201
it developed in western civilization. %$* 201
why is that? %$* 201
because in western civilization, there is an embedded religious idea, and that is the idea of the rational cosmos. %$* 201
the muslim philosopher al-ghazali denies that the universe operates by laws. %$* 201
he says, "everything happens because allah wills it at every given moment," that's why science didn't develop in the muslim world. %$* 201
it's the sense of the whimsical, the miraculous universe. %$* 201
the point i'm trying to get at here is that on the basis of, i would say, a one percent minority of religious rednecks, we have an indictment of all the world's religions as a whole. %$* 201
right. %$* 13
nothing could be more crude and shameful than to imply that athens and jerusalem which have given rise to western civilization, that have shaped our philosophy, our economy, separation of powers, checks, and balances, when thomas jefferson, who-- %$* 201
all right, dinesh, i want to cut you off to let anthony grayling-- %$* 13
yeah, sorry, i mean there are two things, dinesh, with great respect to you, you are the most tremendous rewriter of history i've ever come across in my life. %$* 278
you don't seem to be conscious of the fact that when christianity became dominant in europe in about the third, fourth century a.d.it looked at its sundial, the perusing of the second coming of the messiah hadn't happened, they needed some extra ethics. %$* 278
the ethics of the new testament and the napoleon epistles are very thin, they're the stuff i talked about earlier, give everything away, don't get married, don't bother about tomorrow. %$* 278
where did they get it from? %$* 278
they got it from greek philosophy. %$* 278
most of european culture, and that means culture of the west, is deeply rooted in classical antiquity, in the thinking of socrates, and aristotle, and the stoics. %$* 278
that is where our european outlook-- %$* 278
our cultural outlook comes from. %$* 278
conceptions of justice, of ethics, of a democracy, they all come from the pre-christian state of europe. %$* 278
christianity was an oriental religion that erupted into europe and changed the course of european history, and derailed it for over 1,000 years. %$* 278
people couldn't build a dome like the dome of maxentius in rome because they'd lost the understanding of simple engineering. %$* 278
wasn't until brunelleschi's dome in florence in the 15-- %$* 278
16th century that that was possible. %$* 278
so we're looking at a phenomenon here where religion did to our forefathers, did to the history of our culture exactly what matthew says it's doing again to the prospects for science and progress in our contemporary world. %$* 278
all right. %$* 13
david wolpe. %$* 13
very briefly, anthony, i think actually you're the victim of a very parochial education because long before christianity, judaism enunciated all the ideals that you say did not actually come from religion. %$* 279
in 50 bce, when hillel was asked to summarize all of judaism, he said that which is hateful to you, don't do to others. %$* 279
and the sages of judaism were killed by the roman empire, not be a religious empire, as opposed to socrates who was killed by the athenian polity that you idealize. %$* 279
they killed their own sages. %$* 279
in judaism, we venerated them. %$* 279
and they’re actually the ones who ceded christianity and gave us the morality that you claim came from the stoics. %$* 279
anthony. %$* 13
can i tell david just a quick little anecdote about a conversation i had with a cab driver in london. %$* 278
cab drivers in london are very interesting folk. %$* 278
i asked this man if he’d read the old testament. %$* 278
he said he hadn’t. %$* 278
i said, “do you remember any stories from the old testament.” he thought for a moment. %$* 278
he said, “yep, i remember something about a woman being turned into a pillar of salt,” and i took this to be evidence of some domestic disorder in his own family and wishful thinking. %$* 278
i said to him, “do you remember that story, you know, god didn’t like the homosexuals in sodom so he was going to destroy everybody there? %$* 278
somebody pointed out to him that there might be a righteous person. %$* 278
he sent the angels to tell lot to get out of the city. %$* 278
the citizens wanted those two angels, the handsome young men. %$* 278
and lot said to them, ‘you can have my daughters instead.’ when they finally left the city, what happened to his two daughters? %$* 278
”they didn’t have husbands, so they slept with their father and became the-- %$* 278
all right, we see where you're going. %$* 13
i know the story. %$* 279
by the way, actually you also are the victim of an inadequate biblical education i think because sodom was not destroyed because of homosexuality. %$* 279
read the book of ezekiel. %$* 279
it was destroyed because of the cruelty of the people of sodom, their immorality, and i really-- %$* 279
i think with all due respect that to cite london cab drivers, pithy though they may be as the demonstration that judaism didn’t actually create the morality of the west, may be a little thin. %$* 279
the demonstration. %$* 278
and sodom was destroyed no matter what reason you give to it. %$* 278
i want to go to questions from the audience. %$* 13
i want to move onto your questions and recall that i’d like you to be very terse and to really ask a question that’s on our motion that moves it forward. %$* 13
before we get to it, get all ready for that, i just want to take one - - move things in one more direction, to this thought. %$* 13
i want to rephrase what david wolpe has been saying, is that religion organizes-- %$* 13
religion has the capacity to organize the best in us, to do good things, and to transcend ourselves. %$* 13
and what he paints is a bleak world without that. %$* 13
so, it’s undeniable in places like africa, et cetera, that the enormous amount of work is done through organized religion. %$* 13
and that’s on everybody’s mind, so i’d like you to take that on. %$* 13
well, we can share it. %$* 280
but most people are religious, so it’s not surprising that most people who are out there doing good things are religious. %$* 280
it’s the same argument i would make about scientists. %$* 280
most scientists were christians. %$* 280
well, most everybody was christian. %$* 280
so, of course, most of the scientists were christians. %$* 280
so you’re saying there’s no cause and effect between-- %$* 13
i don’t think so. %$* 280
there’s lots and lots of people who do good things and organize-- %$* 280
i’ll challenge that on the basis of this book right here by the sociologist arthur brooks. %$* 201
it’s called “who really cares? %$* 201
” and it’s the careful study of philanthropy in america. %$* 201
so it’s comparing like with like. %$* 201
it divides america into four groups: religious conservatives, religious liberals, secular conservatives, and secular liberals. %$* 201
and it looks at generosity, not just in terms of money, but also in terms of time, and not to religious causes but to so-called secular causes. %$* 201
turns out that the most charitable people in america, by far, are the religious conservatives. %$* 201
the second most charitable are the religious liberals. %$* 201
the third most charitable are the secular conservatives, and the last are the secular liberals. %$* 201
now, what’s particularly poignant about this is the secular liberals in america are the richest. %$* 201
they earn the most money, but they give away the least. %$* 201
so it is not the case that this is a generic matter of people who happen to be religious. %$* 201
the point which david sloan wilson made in a recent book is that evolution narrows the circle of our sympathies to our kin or to people from whom we can get something. %$* 201
but when you do things in service to god, you’re much more likely to help the stranger or the outsider. %$* 201
all right. %$* 13
a very quick response from the other side if you want, anthony grayling. %$* 13
okay, i just want to make the point that there are plenty of non-religious people involved in charitable endeavors and they don’t stay on afterwards because they don’t have an extra agenda. %$* 278
and i just want to quote to you-- %$* 278
you mean proselytization? %$* 13
yeah exactly. %$* 278
and i don’t-- %$* 278
i just want to-- %$* 278
anthony, can you be explicit about that. %$* 13
yes, sir, because i don’t think that they’re staying on because they haven’t got anything to proselytize about. %$* 278
they don’t want a return for their investment. %$* 278
george bernard shaw said-- %$* 278
very, very quick quote-- %$* 278
he said when he gave up religion-- %$* 278
escaped religion as a teenager, he said that moment was the moment when i felt the dawning of moral passion because people who don’t take a box out of the frozen food warehouse of morality, you know, there it all is, are people who have go to think about their responsibilities and about their relationships to other people. %$* 278
they've got to be people who think about the diversity, how different people are from one another. %$* 278
you know the golden rule, "do unto others as you would have them do unto you," george bernard shaw said, no, under no circumstances should you do to others what you'd like them to do to you because they may not like it. %$* 278
and that's a very good insight. %$* 278
it means see them for what they are in their individuality and personality and base your morality on a genuine understanding of what it is to be human in a human world. %$* 278
all right. %$* 13
i'm going to go to questions. %$* 13
and if i turn down your question, please don't take it personally. %$* 13
it'd just be my judgment that it might not be on point. %$* 13
right in the middle there, yeah. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
you just pointed to yourself. %$* 13
and if you could stand up and tell us your name. %$* 13
hi. %$* 19
my name is elizabeth, and my question to those who are for the motion is, how are the harms of religion different from those of nationalism or racism? %$* 19
and for those against the motion, how are the good things from religion different from the good things that come from secular charities or community organizations or-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
being involved with your family? %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
i'm going to-- %$* 13
good questions, which are really one question that i think we all see. %$* 13
and i will let this side go first. %$* 13
this side for the motion. %$* 13
matthew chapman. %$* 13
well, i think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason. %$* 280
and that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion. %$* 280
and i cannot see how delusion can be healthy to a society. %$* 280
i just can't-- %$* 280
i can't see it. %$* 280
not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other. %$* 280
so some of them are delusional. %$* 280
how can this be healthy? %$* 280
it's divisive. %$* 280
it's nonsensical. %$* 280
and i am not saying that atheism has come up with the perfect solution. %$* 280
but there has to be a better way than this. %$* 280
do you know what it is? %$* 13
i think it's secular humanism. %$* 280
it's atheism. %$* 280
okay. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
david wolpe, do you want to respond? %$* 13
you can either respond to what's just been said or to the question which was a variation. %$* 13
i mean, the frustration that i repeatedly am having in this debate is that we're arguing theory against the world. %$* 279
the world is that there are millions and millions and millions of people who, by their own testimony, although the other side may not believe it, say they're doing good because they believe there is a transcendent purpose in their doing good. %$* 279
therefore, they'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. %$* 279
it's not a club that's going to dissolve. %$* 279
they're not going to go away. %$* 279
they're not going to stop doing it. %$* 279
and they're going to teach their children to do it. %$* 279
and what we hear on the other side, to a great extent is, that's bad because it's delusional. %$* 279
and the question is not actually would the world be better off if everybody had the same scientific ideology? %$* 279
would that be a better world? %$* 279
the world-- %$* 279
the question is, what would it be like if religion were gone? %$* 279
what would it be if you just, all of a sudden, sucked that motivation from these countless people who do good? %$* 279
and that's what i want to know. %$* 279
i'd like to propose an-- %$* 280
matthew chapman. %$* 13
experiment, if i may, which is i would ask the audience, how many of you out there do good things, do charity, visit people in hospitals, take care of friends? %$* 280
and could i see a show of hands of anyone who's involved in charitable endeavors, helping people, taking care of animals, giving money to charity, whatever it is. %$* 280
i hope the rapture happens right now because-- %$* 13
there we have-- %$* 280
i'm going to know who's telling the truth. %$* 13
now-- %$* 280
now i would like to see a show of hands of how many of those people did that because they feared religion or religious authority. %$* 280
feared? %$* 279
well, or were-- %$* 280
or were-- %$* 280
here's-- %$* 279
here's my question. %$* 279
okay. %$* 280
i haven't-- %$* 280
no, i haven't-- %$* 280
i haven't finished yet. %$* 280
hold on for a second, david. %$* 13
i haven't finished yet. %$* 280
okay. %$* 279
or-- %$* 280
i mean, we saw no hands there, or who did it because they thought that by doing good action it would get them into heaven. %$* 280
let's see a show of hand on that. %$* 280
didn't say that, either. %$* 279
now-- %$* 280
david, david, david-- %$* 13
now let's see a show of hands from people who do these good things simply because they have a human empathy towards people who are suffering. %$* 280
i think we have a biased pollster here in the audience, you know. %$* 201
i don't think so. %$* 280
i mean-- %$* 280
all right. %$* 13
we get it. %$* 13
people do good things-- %$* 280
let david respond to that. %$* 13
david wolpe. %$* 13
for other reasons than religion-- %$* 280
matthew, let david come back. %$* 13
the majority here. %$* 280
the reason that that's not persuasive, shall we say, is first of all, very few religious people will tell you it's to get into heaven. %$* 279
it's because it's what god expects them to do. %$* 279
that's first of all. %$* 279
in other words, you do it because other human beings are created in the image of god. %$* 279
and if you take that out, then our link is a species link. %$* 279
but if we're all children of the same god, then you are my brother and sister, and that's why you do it. %$* 279
it's different. %$* 279
it's not because you are afraid of god. %$* 279
and second, people's self- reported charitable doings, although obviously everyone here is completely honest. %$* 279
people's self-reported charitable doings are a lot less reliable than survey after survey after survey. %$* 279
and the way that the surveys were answered by putnam, by brooks, by koenig, by respected sociologists, the way that he answered them is by asking you to raise your hand. %$* 279
now, i want to ask you seriously, how many of you believe that all these sociologists and psychologists are cooking the data, and how many-- %$* 279
you don't have to raise your hand. %$* 279
and how many of you believe that whether you like religion or not, the truth is that it does make people much more inclined to be self-sacrificing in this world. %$* 279
and if you don't believe it, then all i can say is, i know a world without religion that you can look at. %$* 279
i'm from that world. %$* 279
it's called hollywood. %$* 279
all right. %$* 13
let's go to another question. %$* 13
right down in the front row there. %$* 13
no, the gentleman. %$* 13
you'll probably notice a male-female pattern in my selection, the next question you know who should raise their hands. %$* 13
thank you so much for this evening. %$* 18
i think it's a great debate, and i truly enjoy it. %$* 18
i am muslim, okay. %$* 18
so definitely, my question will go to you guys. %$* 18
great point that you make, but i will make it quick. %$* 18
the thing is that religion is really the question for me today because is it the misuse of religion that's really bringing all this drama and all the chaos that we really talk about, or is it really religion itself? %$* 18
because if i have a weapon, right, and i use it against you, and in this day today, we go to court, i will take the person on his character and take him to court and take him to jail, not the companies that make the weapons or the owner of the company. %$* 18
but i will take the person on his own act. %$* 18
so it could really-- %$* 18
i think you started with the question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 18
which was, is it religion, or is it the way that some people are using it or misusing it? %$* 13
that's a terrific question. %$* 13
let's go to this side. %$* 13
matthew chapman. %$* 13
well, i mean, that, to me, is the entire problem. %$* 280
if you look at any religious text, it can be interpreted in any way and give you an excuse to do anything. %$* 280
these gentleman here, i'm sure they're very nice people, and they look at it in the most benign way. %$* 280
i've heard rabbi wolpe over there say that the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books, and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense. %$* 280
i agree. %$* 280
and when you filter them out, what you get is humanism. %$* 280
jefferson did the same thing with the bible. %$* 280
he took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion. %$* 280
he got 48 pages. %$* 280
i say you could bring it down to one page that said-- %$* 280
or one phrase which would be "do unto others as you do-- %$* 280
as you would have done to you." it is as simple as that. %$* 280
and all of those texts-- %$* 280
so matthew, your answer to his-- %$* 13
your answer to his question is, it's not just how religion gets used. %$* 13
the problem is religion itself. %$* 13
the problem is the ancient texts that are infinitely interpretable for any purpose. %$* 280
okay. %$* 13
dinesh, do you have somewhere new to take this response? %$* 13
well, yeah. %$* 201
first of all, jefferson, who was a man of the enlightenment, not a very devout christian, as you point out correctly. %$* 201
but when jefferson was asked, "what is the source of our rights? %$* 201
" he could have said the social contract. %$* 201
he could have said the enlightenment. %$* 201
but no, he said it's the creator. %$* 201
he could think of only one source. %$* 201
one word about the texts. %$* 201
i think the point that rabbi wolpe and i are stressing is that the way to interpret the text is to look and see whether the people who revered the text do the things in the text. %$* 201
so, for example, he read a passage from deuteronomy about chopping off people's arms or removing their genitals. %$* 201
so i ask you, how many religious people are going around without arms or genitals? %$* 201
no one who is jewish or christian reads the texts that way. %$* 201
so there's a form of, you might say, atheist fundamentalism in taking the text in so literal a way that no christian-- %$* 201
i mean, there was a debate that between paul and the early apostles about which aspects of the ancient law should apply to christians. %$* 201
it was settled 2,000 years ago that christians would not follow the old testament in a literal way. %$* 201
and even the guys in dover aren't doing that. %$* 201
so in a way, i think these guys are charging an imaginary dragon. %$* 201
okay. %$* 13
you're trying to hold us accountable to texts which were, in a sense, not taken as literal 2,000 years ago. %$* 201
in the fourth-- %$* 13
and we have %$* 18
i want to move on. %$* 13
and fourth row, you can-- %$* 13
in your closing remarks, you can-- %$* 13
my question is a little bit more broad. %$* 19
it's that, isn't religion basically a fear of death and ultimately your ultimate judgment and the selfish belief that humans are so important that we should have the right to live forever? %$* 19
well, you guys are going to say yes to that, i'm pretty sure. %$* 13
so i'm going to go over this way. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
i think your question is echoing an argument in sigmund freud that religion is wish fulfillment. %$* 201
we all-- %$* 201
but life is tough, we have diabetes, we have the gravedigger, we would like to have another life, and so religion is made up to accommodate that wish. %$* 201
now, i think that actually that theory doesn't square with what religion actually holds, and here's why. %$* 201
certainly it explains heaven. %$* 201
heaven is a good example of wish fulfillment. %$* 201
but remember that all of the major abrahamic religions also have hell. %$* 201
now, think about that. %$* 201
hell is a lot worse than diabetes. %$* 201
hell is a lot worse than death. %$* 201
why would we make that stuff up? %$* 201
the bottom line i'm trying to make is that that diagnosis of religion as expressing wish fulfillment runs headlong into the actual facts that religious people actually sometimes fear a fate far worse than anything that life can offer them. %$* 201
okay, let's go to gentleman-- %$* 13
yeah, i'm looking right at you, thank you. %$* 13
if you can rise a mic will come to you. %$* 13
if there's anybody in the part of the auditorium that's not lit, i want to confess i can't see you, if you really truly want to ask a question, if you come down the steps a little bit and i'll be able to see you, i'll try to call on you. %$* 13
i can't promise it, but i'll try to call on you. %$* 13
sir, go ahead. %$* 13
dinesh, this is specifically for you. %$* 281
can you tell us who you are, please? %$* 13
robert shillman %$* 281
thank you. %$* 13
how could you possibly give a speech leaving out the holocaust, bosnia, turkey, and the armenians, how could you quote that ridiculous book which has been disproved when you take out the money that has been given to the religion all of the numbers shift the other way. %$* 281
you're sitting here systematically making up statistics to try and convince us that it's a good thing. %$* 281
and i'd love just your response. %$* 281
okay, i'm going to-- %$* 13
dinesh, i don't-- %$* 13
i don't want you to-- %$* 13
i just think that's going to turn into a circle that doesn't get us further on our motion, so i'm going to move on to a different question. %$* 13
really? %$* 13
okay, let's do that-- %$* 13
can we do that show of hand things-- %$* 13
the show of hands thing? %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
make it very quick though, please. %$* 13
i want to focus on the holocaust. %$* 201
i would recommend to you this book, "hitler's table talk." it's edited by the prominent historian, hugh trevor-roper, and it constitutes direct notes of hitler's comments authorized by bormann between 1941 and 1945.in the early 1930s when hitler was coming to power, he wanted to win over the bavarian catholics and the lutherans in germany and so he invented what he called a nazi christ, not a christ who was killed but a jew killer. %$* 201
and he tried to sell that to the churches which didn't go for it. %$* 201
this book records page after page of hitler's loathing and hatred for christianity. %$* 201
he regarded the church as the most dangerous opposition to the nazi regime, and i could read for an hour quotations from hitler's mouth about his hatred for christianity. %$* 201
my point is what the atheists will put up on their websites are quotations from the early 1930s, the mein kampf where hitler says, "i'm doing the lord's work." this was part of a propaganda campaign to win over the churches that was unsuccessful. %$* 201
hitler was a hater of christianity. %$* 201
i've never called hitler an atheist, he was a certain kind of a pagan. %$* 201
okay, okay, all right, everybody happy? %$* 13
all right, good. %$* 13
i just don't feel that it really moved our topic about whether religion is good or bad. %$* 13
ma'am, sitting on the stairs because you came all the way down-- %$* 13
which one? %$* 19
sure, yeah, yeah. %$* 13
all right, hi, my name is katherine, and it seems today that there seems to be a disconnect between the two sides. %$* 19
one side argues that religion only creates good and perpetuates charity and civic engagement while the other says that it's a system of discrimination and religious doctrine creating hate. %$* 19
i have a feeling that the truth is somewhere in the middle. %$* 19
however, my question is this, how do you get the benefits of civic engagement without the discrimination, or is it even possible to disentangle the two within religious doctrine? %$* 19
is that more of a question to this side? %$* 13
sounds like it. %$* 13
sure. %$* 19
sounds like it, yeah. %$* 13
david wolpe. %$* 13
well, i mean, it is certainly true that good and bad are mixed in every society, in every organization, in every human being, and the question you ask is a metaphysical question, that is, "how do you get only the good and not the bad? %$* 279
" i don't know that, that's possible to do in anything. %$* 279
there's no charity that has not been subject to corruption, and to misappropriation of funds, and to people doing cruelty, and i don't know that you can wash religion away, and actually the essence of the debate is does religion do bad sometimes, absolutely, but if you measure the good in which religion does in the world and, as i said, the unadvertised good, the small good, the constant good, then what do you get in a world without it? %$* 279
and the essence of the debate is whether, in fact, that world’s going to better or worse. %$* 279
i think it’s almost undebatable. %$* 279
any response from this side on that? %$* 13
yeah, i think the response is that you have to notice that most of the advance countries of the world are secular constitutionally, like this one, or functionally secular like my own united kingdom. %$* 278
and the point about those societies is that they organize welfare, education, defense, infrastructure, and they do this not in the name of one or another religion but in the name of society generally. %$* 278
so when you look at the benefits, you look at the rational application of our ideas about how a society should flourish and advance and what the needs are of the members of that society, the post-enlightenment world, the world since the 18th century, the world which has been putting to work the ideas of scientific rationality has made a vast improvement to the lives of most individual people. %$* 278
when you think of the poverty and you think of the ill health and you think of the divisiveness of societies before that time and compare them to the society of today-- %$* 278
and notice this. %$* 278
in every city of the world, there are millions of acts of personal kindness and cooperation between people, far outweighs all the conflict and difficulty there is in the world. %$* 278
and it has nothing to do with their ideologies or religions or anything else. %$* 278
it’s just a fact about us. %$* 278
as social animals, we need one another and we care about one another. %$* 278
here’s a very simple example. %$* 278
you’re walking down the street, so you see somebody ahead of you. %$* 278
a big pile of bricks on a wall are just about to topple on that person’s head. %$* 278
what do you do? %$* 278
your instinct is not to say this is going to be interesting. %$* 278
your instinct is to call out to them and say, “watch out! %$* 278
” and you do it not because you’re an evangelical or a jew or a muslim but because you’re a human being and that’s another human being. %$* 278
all right. %$* 13
another question. %$* 13
i would like to add though, i think-- %$* 280
matthew chapman. %$* 13
it’s absurd to say that secular people advertise and religious people don’t. %$* 280
religion is a constant process or advertising. %$* 280
every good deed religious people do is taken along with a banner showing whatever religion did it. %$* 280
doctors without borders makes no claim to having any religion, nor does it claim to be atheist-- %$* 280
i mean, do you really think that accusation is fair? %$* 13
can i do a poll now of the group? %$* 279
let me ask you, how many of you had heard of the largest aid organization of the world that i mentioned at the beginning? %$* 279
how many of you had heard of it? %$* 279
now how many of you had heard of doctors without borders? %$* 279
i rest my case. %$* 279
all right. %$* 13
let’s move-- %$* 13
can i take a poll on should we stop doing polls? %$* 13
show of hands. %$* 13
sir, you’re up. %$* 13
sure, thank you. %$* 282
this is a question for matthew-- %$* 282
could you tell us your name, please? %$* 13
frank roberts %$* 282
thank you. %$* 13
this is a question for matthew and professor grayling. %$* 282
for the question of the evening is would the world be better off without religion, but my fear is that the question is in and of itself somewhat disingenuous because it keeps it-- %$* 282
religion seems to be this theoretical thing up here. %$* 282
and i’m wondering if we can ground it to more practical examples. %$* 282
so my question is would you be willing to say in public that the world would be better off without jews, or the world would be better off without the civil rights movement, a movement that we know was based in a kind of radical black christianity. %$* 282
so, my question to you is, again, rather than asking would the world be better off without religion, is it more so a question of whether or not we think that religion is problematic or has been misappropriated, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but it seems like the very question of whether the world is better off is problematic? %$* 282
wait, can you zero in-- %$* 13
because i know that you can because-- %$* 13
zero in to the one point that you want to ask. %$* 13
the one point that i want to ask is, is the very term of the question somewhat disingenuous because we know that we would never say that the world would be better off without religious people-- %$* 282
all right. %$* 13
so you’re asking would the world be better off without religious people, and is that what you’re arguing? %$* 13
no, i think we’re arguing the world would be better off without religion. %$* 278
we’re-- %$* 278
the point is-- %$* 278
but i think the point of his question is that-- %$* 13
i understand his question exactly, and it’s a deep point of principle that in all these kinds of debates, it’s not about individuals. %$* 278
this is not about people. %$* 278
this is not about human beings. %$* 278
we understand why human beings are religious. %$* 278
they’re brought up to be religious, or they’re not told enough about the history of their religion. %$* 278
they’re given the most updated version of it, and so on. %$* 278
so it’s not about attacking individuals. %$* 278
it’s about attacking ideas. %$* 278
it’s about attacking ideologies. %$* 278
it’s about attacking conceptual frameworks which act like spectacles that make people see things in a particular way. %$* 278
that’s the argument. %$* 278
it’s not saying that we would like all jewish people or muslim people or christian people taken as individuals not to be there. %$* 278
no. %$* 278
what we would like them is to be free from those distorting ideologies. %$* 278
we’re being-- %$* 13
i want to point out we’re being live-streamed also on slate.com. %$* 13
and we've asked viewers and readers of slate to submit questions. %$* 13
and i have one that i find quite interesting to put to the side arguing for a world with religion. %$* 13
dan riley in portland, oregon, says, "would a world in which hinduism or islam or norse paganism were the only religions still be preferable to a world without religion? %$* 13
" in other words, he's kind of-- %$* 13
if there weren't christianity and judaism, but there were one religion motivating people, but it wasn't your favorite. %$* 13
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
i'll make my own case hard by looking solely at islam because it is such a controversial subject in our world today. %$* 201
i would submit that the world would be vastly worse-- %$* 201
the muslim world would be vastly worse if it wasn't for islam. %$* 201
let's look at why that's the case. %$* 201
first of all, you have to look at what was there in the bedouin culture before mohammed. %$* 201
rape, pillage, concubinage. %$* 201
mohammed actually was a moderate in limiting the number of wives to four and by basically saying that you had to treat the four wives equally, giving them all the same gifts and so on. %$* 201
mohammed essentially ensured that the entire muslim world, for the most part, you'd have people with one wife. %$* 201
polygamy is very rare in the muslim world for that reason. %$* 201
so the bottom line of it is that islam was a vastly civilizing force, not to mention the introduction of a cosmopolitan civilization with a history, a philosophy and a distinctive architecture, not to mention great islamic philosophers and thinkers. %$* 201
even the great jewish scholar bernard lewis has a great appreciation for the civilizing influence-- %$* 201
all right. %$* 13
of islam in the world. %$* 201
a clear answer to that question, so i want to go to the other side to see if you respond to that. %$* 13
well, i just-- %$* 278
anthony grayling. %$* 13
have in mind what gautama buddha said to his followers. %$* 278
he said, "don't make me a god, and don't turn this into a religion. %$* 278
it's a philosophy. %$* 278
it's a philosophy of compassion. %$* 278
it's a philosophy of authenticity. %$* 278
it's a philosophy about living respectfully and responsibly. %$* 278
don't make it a religion, and don't turn me into a god." and the thing is that even if it was just the norse gods and paganism or the olympian gods, somehow or other, it would cease being that thing that the buddha wanted a philosophy to be, and it would become something that admitted, you know, all its extremes, including the hypocrites on one side and the extremists on the other. %$* 278
okay. %$* 13
ma'am, you were patient before when it was almost your turn. %$* 13

asa hutchinson says, the problem, the reason mexico has become this hellhole is because it did not declare war on drugs and did not prosecute efficiently and did not take the fight to the enemy. %$* 447
so then they do that, and jorge castañeda says, that’s the problem. %$* 447
i think it just proves that this is all kabuki. %$* 447
what we are talking about fundamentally is, these countries, among the poorer countries in the world, they are trying to fulfill insatiable demand for $65 billion of product. %$* 447
if it goes away from mexico we will be back here next year, and we will be talking about, you know, the drug war in peru, or somewhere else, because, the supply—asa hutchinson, as a republican you surely believe, that, if there is a huge amount of demand from the richest country in the world, somebody is going to figure out a way to supply it. %$* 447
all right, team—team— %$* 13
that somebody is mexico right now and we’re blaming them. %$* 447
team against, fareed zakaria has just said you’re contradicting each other. %$* 13
asa hutchinson, can you find unity. %$* 13
well, i think first of all, among the six of us up here there’s probably a different position on this issue for each one of us. %$* 448
but what this side is united upon is the proposition, and we have to come back to the proposition, that america is to blame for mexico’s drug war. %$* 448
and there is unity on this side that that is not the case. %$* 448
whether you take the argument that it is the decision of president calderón, or whether it’s the fact of the historic problems in mexico, their lack of cooperation or lack of the rule of law, america is not to blame. %$* 448
now let me see if there’s unity on your side, fareed. %$* 448
i just want to make it clear that if you’re saying america’s to blame to me that implies that there’s something wrong with our governmental policy. %$* 448
now you can argue that as individual citizens, we should be making better decisions not to use drugs. %$* 448
but as you have libertarians on your side, that’s an individual citizen, not a governmental decision. %$* 448
so i assume that you’re saying our government is doing something wrong. %$* 448
we’ve had a balanced approach, strategy, of supply reduction, demand reduction, trying to teach young people to make good decisions, and rehabilitation. %$* 448
do you want to move away from that to legalize marijuana, to legalize cocaine, to legalize heroin, to legalize methamphetamine, to legalize ecstasy that comes from other countries. %$* 448
what is the position of your team, do you want to legalize all drugs, is that the shift in policy that you— %$* 448
jeffrey— %$* 13
—wish to take. %$* 448
jeffrey miron. %$* 13
i don’t want to speak for others on that question— %$* 449
i want an answer from fareed first too, though. %$* 448
no, let me, i want to go to the libertarian. %$* 13
my— my position, separate from—independent of this debate is that we should legalize all drugs. %$* 449
i think the unity amongst the three of us although we probably differ in nuances of that view, is that, unquestionably the magnitude of resources we devote to prohibition is grotesquely excessive, that the set of things that we prohibit is substantially excessive, that there may be a role for government to try to address the negatives associated with drug use, through treatment, through harm reduction, through various policies, but that the current practice of spending tens of billions, by my estimates about $80 billion a year, locking people up, to try to get rid of the drug trade, is an incredibly counterproductive policy and we should stop. %$* 449
chris cox, what’s wrong with that argument? %$* 13
well, i’d like to point out what may be another contradiction, fareed seems to think that gun control is— %$* 450
no, no, i want you to answer the question, what’s wrong with that argument. %$* 13
i’ll defer to asa hutchinson on the— %$* 450
okay— %$* 13
—the drug— %$* 450
fair enough— %$* 13
—on the drug question. %$* 450
well, should i answer asa’s %$* 447
because he’s charging me with— %$* 447
please— %$* 13
can i butt in on that too— %$* 451
i mean, you— %$* 447
take it, fareed— %$* 13
—you might be surprised but asa, i would join with the former presidents of brazil and mexico and colombia, who recently put out a report in which they said, we just need a paradigm shift here because what we have done is criminalize and terrorize this entire process, by waging war on drugs, and what we need to start doing, is a comprehensive review of whether there are ways to decriminalize it. %$* 447
look, many people have decriminalized drugs, i would be in favor of a controlled, slow, incremental approach, to see what happens. %$* 447
but i think there’s no question, that our current approach, massive criminalization, massive prohibitions, and most importantly the exporting of that war to other countries, is producing all the violence, it’s producing the criminality as jeff pointed out. %$* 447
the reason this whole business is violent and criminal is because we have prosecuted it as a war. %$* 447
that is to me the fundamental responsibility we have, which we cannot shirk from. %$* 447
there are people dying in mexico because of those choices that we have made. %$* 447
chris cox, your expertise is the weapons issue, and the others—you made an argument that, laws restricting weapons won’t work, the other side is making more a simple argument, the very presence of american, of weapons sourced in the united states, are responsible for the war to some degree. %$* 13
can you take on that question, the weapons are there—are those weapons part of the reason that—and they’re in the hands of the cartels—are those weapons part of the reason, that the war is going on and being prosecuted. %$* 13
well there’s no question when drug cartels are armed with hand grenades, when they’re armed with rpg’s, fully automatic weapons, that there’s a devastating effect on not only the drug cartels themselves fighting with one another but the innocent people in mexico, who have no ability to defend themselves whatsoever. %$* 450
but the question becomes more of a common-sense type question. %$* 450
is there something that the us can do, from a more gun control standpoint, that’s going to work any better than what works now, there’s a total ban— %$* 450
okay— %$* 13
—on guns, basically— %$* 450
fair question— %$* 13
—in mexico now— %$* 450
—let me take it to the other side— %$* 13
it’s not working in mexico. %$* 450
all right— %$* 451
andrés martinez. %$* 13
yeah, first off, i think asa is twisting the proposition a bit by bringing it back constantly to the american government. %$* 451
“america is to blame for mexico’s drug war,” the “america” there is, is a larger entity, it’s all of society. %$* 451
there are government policies but there’s also individual behavior and societal norms, and the disconnect between our laws and our behavior. %$* 451
and as a good republican i would think that you wouldn’t necessarily always equate america with the american government. %$* 451
i think the dynamic— the dynamic here is there’s a pattern of behavior in terms of that this bilateral relationship. %$* 451
where the united states historically has seen mexico as a kind of back-yard las vegas where, the usual rules don’t apply, what happens in mexico can stay in mexico. %$* 451
so we can export our, our unresolved contradictions down there. %$* 451
people in mexico are bearing the burdens of our conflict on drugs, and the fact that we have dysfunctional laws, it’s mexicans doing the dying for our unresolved— we can’t bear as a society to go without these drugs, but we also can’t bring ourselves to legalize them. %$* 451
and— %$* 451
andrés, andrés, i— %$* 13
—what’s the cost of this— %$* 451
—you’re not actually answering chris’s question, chris, restate your question— %$* 13
i don’t— %$* 451
—in one sentence— andrés martinez i didn’t have an opportunity to talk about the— %$* 13
okay, my question was, there’s basically a total gun ban in mexico now. %$* 450
how effective is that working and do you think that we should bring that sort of gun ban to america, when if you look at cities like juarez, mexico, which are just devastated with cri—with drug cartel violence, and el paso which is just a stone’s throw across the rio grande, that’s the third safest city in america, how do you rectify— %$* 450
well you’re also trying to twist the proposition into making it “america’s gun laws are to blame for mexico’s drug war.” i think there’s a broader issue here, i mean i would follow the money, not necessarily the guns. %$* 451
there are an awful lot of american guns making their way to mexico. %$* 451
however, it is true, that if you’re making $20-30 billion in the united states because american society has decided that this one industry that it doesn’t want to go away is going to be ceded to criminal organizations, you would be able to buy those guns elsewhere, i will grant you that. %$* 451
if the united states had the toughest gun control laws in the entire world %$* 451
the mexican drug cartels would still be armed to the teeth. %$* 451
what they’re really getting out of the united states, first and foremost, is guns, the fact that it’s very convenient for them to pick up guns while they’re here tallying up their profits, that just adds insult to injury. %$* 451
jorge castañeda. %$* 13
i would sort of go back to another question, my impression is that, at least on that side, you all seem to agree that this is a failed war. %$* 452
which is certainly what i think, it’s the title of my book. %$* 452
i quote at length, zedillo, cardoso and gaviria document at the end, who also said it’s a failed war. %$* 452
and i think that this is—failed wars should not be waged. %$* 452
if you continue, if you persevere in a failed war, you will continue to fail. %$* 452
so i think the key issue there is, what should mexico and the united states, and basically the two governments because there, andrés, it’s difficult to decide on the part of american society or mexican society, that’s why you vote, that’s why we vote now. %$* 452
we didn’t always— we always voted but sometimes we voted for people or sometimes people voted for us but anyway. %$* 452
or the government did. %$* 452
but, the fact is that now the question is what should the governments do. %$* 452
and the problem is that the obama administration and the calderón administration are in total synch in continuing this failed war. %$* 452
pouring money into it, having more people die in mexico because of it, while at the same time—and i agree with the obama administration— at the same time, president obama and attorney general holder say they are not going to apply federal anti-marijuana laws in those states that have legalized medical marijuana. %$* 452
which i think is wonderful by the way. %$* 452
what i don’t understand is why president obama and attorney general holder on the one hand do that, and on the other hand, give money to calderón to wage a failed war on drugs. %$* 452
i think that’s the real question, not so much if i may be allowed to say so, who is to blame for mexico’s drug war, which perhaps was not the right way to phrase the debate. %$* 452
i’ll come back to you, asa, jeffrey miron. %$* 13
i will come back to you. %$* 13
just want to say i agree with that— %$* 448
okay, let— are— you wanted to say very briefly? %$* 13
oh no, i just for once i do agree with my debate partner— i think he sorta nailed it— %$* 448
it’s so nice when it works out that way. %$* 13
you just heard— %$* 449
jeffrey miron— %$* 13
just heard mr. %$* 449
hutchinson say it that they’ve only agreed with each other once so far this evening. %$* 449
to go back to the gun point. %$* 449
what christopher cox is arguing is that if you take a substance, a commodity, that a large number of people want to own, and you prohibit it, a whole bunch of consequences happen. %$* 449
the market goes underground, it may shrink a bit, you may make it more costly, but it’s not going to disappear. %$* 449
it’s going to go underground. %$* 449
then there will be corruption, as people try to evade those laws, there will be violence as people in the underground market resolve their disputes. %$* 449
there will be poor quality control and so on and so forth. %$* 449
mr. %$* 449
cox makes that argument, with respect to guns. %$* 449
okay, he’s opposed to strenuous gun laws to prohibiting guns, but exactly the same arguments, apply to prohibiting drugs. %$* 449
the structure of the argument, the logic of the argument, is totally compelling, and it’s right for both commodities, not just one, and not just the others, so libertarians think that guns should be legal, and drugs should be legal. %$* 449
i hope that my opponent agrees with that proposition. %$* 449
chris cox actually, i agree— i agree with quite a bit of jeff’s arguments, certainly— %$* 449
chris cox— %$* 13
—not with regards to guns but i certainly agree with your study— %$* 450
oh, they’re dropping like flies on that side— %$* 447
actually—there is a contradiction, believe it or not there is a contradiction on the other side. %$* 450
fareed has pointed out some false statistics to suggest that more gun control laws would somehow have a major impact in this drug war. %$* 450
ice agents have said we already have— %$* 450
fareed, did you make that— %$* 13
i don’t think he said— %$* 449
did you make the point about gun control— %$* 13
no, my point was the one you raised, the general prevalence of 280 million guns here, which is about a third of all guns worldwide, the fact that we share a border with one of the poorer countries in the world, and there is vast drug trade and vast cartels means %$* 447
this is an easy way to criminalize and to accelerate the violence of this trade. %$* 447
all right, i interrupted you because i didn’t hear fareed make that argument, so %$* 13
okay, what i heard fareed say was parrot many of the arguments that have been made by the gun control community but perhaps that’s not a fair reflection on fareed’s own personal views but the contradiction is that, to suggest that we have a lot of guns, therefore, we’re part of the problem is to suggest that more gun control would make us less of a problem, and i think what jeff has argued, certainly in his past writings is that, homicide rates amongst countries with the highest gun control, tend to be higher than homicide rates with those countries with the lowest gun control. %$* 450
so that’s certainly an area where i agree with jeff but i would not agree with jeff that, crystal meth, crystal meth addicts all over this country that are devastating communities all over this country are somehow a fair comparison to law-abiding gun owners in this country. %$* 450
can i—could i respond to that, i mean— %$* 449
yes, please do. %$* 13
throughout the last— %$* 449
we talked about— %$* 450
—90 years— %$* 449
—legalizing drugs— %$* 450
—the drug prohibitionists have identified one— %$* 449
—we’re talking about legalizing crystal meth? %$* 450
sorry? %$* 13
we’re talking about legalizing crystal meth now— %$* 450
yes. %$* 449
yes, because if you go back and read what people were writing in the 1950s— %$* 449
jeffrey miron— %$* 13
—about marijuana. %$* 449
they were saying things absolutely as strong, absolutely worse than what people are claiming now about crystal meth, if you look at the data on the— %$* 449
whoa-hoahhh— %$* 450
—number of people who use crystal meth, there’s zillions of people using it every day and a teeny fraction of them are doing the kinds of things that you’re describing. %$* 449
the drug prohibitionists for 90 years have constantly had a moving target, as soon as they identify one drug and say this is the killer drug, this is the one that’s the most evil, this is the one that’s going to destroy society. %$* 449
but, relevant to— %$* 13
and there’s some violence— %$* 449
—relevant to our motion— %$* 13
—associated with trying to prohibit that— %$* 449
—relevant to our motion, jeffrey’s point is that if you decriminalize, the need for war would go away because the bad guys wouldn’t have to defend and fight out on the streets, they could do it in courtrooms. %$* 13
but, and— %$* 450
do— what do you think of that. %$* 13
again, i think the point’s almost irrelevant. %$* 450
the point is, whether or not the weapons that we’re suggesting, and jeff has written as well that %$* 450
violence— weapons don’t create violence, violence creates a need for weapons and that these weapons are coming as even andrés has pointed out from other areas, not only central america but russian, the former soviet blocs that dumped guns in mexico during the cold war by the millions, if certainly by the tens of thousands. %$* 450
these weapons are there, and so, it’s really—i tend to agree with jorge, we’re missing the point here— %$* 450
right. %$* 13
is america to blame, of course we’re not— %$* 450
well let me ask asa, the whole decriminalization question seems to get your hackles up. %$* 13
well— i think— %$* 448
his point is not whether it’s good or bad for the users, his point is whether it would make the war go away. %$* 13
and i’m going to get to that, but i would think— i would think, i was hoping that we would have agreement that cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin are harmful drugs and our goal in society would be to reduce the usage of those drugs. %$* 448
well do you think— %$* 449
after hearing jeffrey say— %$* 448
—alcohol and tobacco are harmful drugs— %$* 449
after jeffrey argues that methamphetamine is not as harmful as everybody says, and that would include the decriminalization, we can’t even reach an agreement on that point. %$* 448
but if you want to reduce usage, for example alaska in the ‘70s voted to decriminalize marijuana. %$* 448
and once they did that guess what happened. %$* 448
the usage went up, parents did not like what they saw, and so the alaskan voters voted to recriminalize that offense. %$* 448
because usage went up, and that should not be the goal of parents, that’s the concern of parents. %$* 448
in terms of the drug trafficking and the war, i would make the argument it might have some peripheral impact, it depends on the extent that you legalize, if you just legalize marijuana, they’re not going to go away. %$* 448
guess what, they’ve got cocaine, they’ve got heroin, et cetera, to market. %$* 448
if you legalize all of them, guess what. %$* 448
you still have prescription drugs there would be a black market on, that are totally regulated. %$* 448
they’re moving into other areas from alien trafficking, they’re business people. %$* 448
and the only solution to the war on drugs, is the rule of law. %$* 448
and mexico does not have that right now. %$* 448
i want them to have that, calderón seems to want them to have it. %$* 448
the fight is on the rule of law and unless you establish that, decriminalization is not going to rid mexico of the drug war. %$* 448
andrés, just one second, i’m going to come right to you, i want to go after andrés speaks to questions from the audience, i want to remind you once again, raise your hand, i’ll find you, a microphone will be handed over to you, stand up, if you’re a member of the news media please identify yourself, and please make it a question. %$* 13
andrés. %$* 13
i totally agree that the issue is the rule of law but it’s the rule of law in this country, it’s our failure to uphold the rule of law that is to blame for mexico’s drug war. %$* 451
we are the ones with an addiction rate of illicit drugs that’s six times higher than in mexico. %$* 451
we are the ones who are abusing this stuff, but can’t bring ourselves to legalize it, and it’s people in mexico who are dying for that. %$* 451
we as a society, and i don’t think-- %$* 451
you can be agnostic about whether or not drugs should be legalized, if that were the subject, the proposition tonight, i’m not sure which side i would be on. %$* 451
you can be agnostic on that, and still recognize the, the basic fact that the united states is to blame for the war on drugs. %$* 451
and i’m glad you mentioned immigration because you say, well, they’re diversifying into human trafficking. %$* 451
well geez, i wonder why, again. %$* 451
our failure to enact an immigration reform that matches supply and demand, again, we—again, back to my point about— %$* 451
you’re blaming the united states for a lot of ills, in the world— %$* 448
well %$* 451
let’s think about this, we are as addicted to mexican low-cost labor as we are to imported drugs— %$* 451
and mexico has no— %$* 448
—but we fail—but we— %$* 451
—responsibility whatsoever—? %$* 448
but we cannot— but we cannot bring ourselves to create legal channels for that. %$* 451
so either we have to decide, let’s close down the border, not import low-cost labor, and it’s the similar—it’s a parallel debate to what’s happening on the drug front. %$* 451
let’s %$* 13
your point about marijuana, 60 percent of the cartels’ profits come from marijuana— %$* 451
audience questions now. %$* 13
if you just bring your hand up %$* 13
there’s a gentleman, with a blue shirt, necktie, no jacket. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
hello, this is a question for mr. %$* 9
hutchinson. %$* 9
and i want to remind everybody how mr. %$* 9
hutchinson started talking. %$* 9
mr. %$* 9
hutchinson started talking that as a representative of the us government, he was in mexico, and he was trying to pressure the government of mr. %$* 9
fox, to bring troops to go after, or people, to go after the people that had killed mr. %$* 9
camarena. %$* 9
and had tortured mr. %$* 9
camarena. %$* 9
i have these two—there are two questions that arise from. %$* 9
both of them— %$* 9
just, just—i, i’ll just take one. %$* 13
okay. %$* 9
the, the question that arises from that, doesn’t he feel, as a representative of the american government, that he has a special duty to respect the sensitivity of the mexican people about bringing american armed forces into mexico. %$* 9
because there is a special event in the amer—mexican %$* 9
okay, i—sir, i’ll stop you there because, you did ask a question— %$* 13
no, but this is very important that he forgets— %$* 9
sir, i’m sorry, i need you to— %$* 13
—the united states took away— %$* 9
—get to your point and we do understand— %$* 13
—50 percent of mexican— %$* 9
asa, why don’t you take it and then jorge wants to try— %$* 13
yeah, i think that it— %$* 448
thank you, sir. %$* 13
thank you, sir, it is actually a very good point that, if the united states did not regard mexican sovereignty, and we wanted to solve the transit and source country problems we would send our troops there. %$* 448
but they’re a sovereign nation and we cannot go in there without an act of— declaration of war or some good cause which doesn’t exist, we’re not doing that, we’re regarding their sovereignty. %$* 448
but whenever we have a high regard for their sovereignty, that means america is not to blame. %$* 448
and yes, it wasn’t president fox that i—i did go to see him but, camarena was killed under a previous administration, i was not administrator then. %$* 448
but i know that history very well because it lives in the hearts of every dea agent. %$* 448
and the fact is that he was murdered brutally, but more importantly, we wanted to assist mexico and we were not allowed to do so because of the sovereignty of that country. %$* 448
responsibility is something that’s shared, blame is something that is uniquely america’s fault, and that is not the case here. %$* 448
fareed zakaria. %$* 13
can i just point out that we are respecting mexico’s sovereignty, we are not respecting so much afghanistan’s sovereignty, we have a hundred thousand troops in there, nato and the us, we will have 130,000 troops in there. %$* 447
and yet, we have not been able to do anything about the opium trade. %$* 447
i doubt very much if we send american troops into mexico it would change the fundamental fact, where there is demand there will be supply— %$* 447
guess what, we’re not doing that, that’s not the suggestion— %$* 448
jorge castañeda— %$* 13
—it’s not on the table— %$* 448
just as a point of factual issues here. %$* 452
to the best of my knowledge, and although i was not present at all of the meetings but between my father, my brother and myself we have been present at most of the summit meetings between american and mexican presidents over the last 30 years, i do not recall ever the united states having asked for us troops to go to mexico, firstly. %$* 452
and secondly, strangely enough, though obviously i stand by what you both quoted, in the case of president calderón, in december of 2006, my impression, i don’t know this as a fact. %$* 452
my impression is actually, that the bush people did not pressure him into declaring this war. %$* 452
this was a decision he made absolutely on his own. %$* 452
unlike what had happened on other occasions under echeverría, lópez portillo, mainly de la madrid, and then again on—under salinas, my impression back then, the us did pressure these mexican presidents to engage in more active drug enforcement, but the bush people, not because they believed in not holding, pursuing this war, but perhaps because they had other wars to pursue, which were concentrating their attention at the time— %$* 452
okay, halfway up the aisle there— %$* 13
—did not pressure mexico. %$* 452
hi, i’m robert aleto, i’m a student. %$* 9
my question concerns the mexican national economy and what role you think that plays in this issue. %$* 9
because, there’s been a lot of demographic %$* 9
and will you be able to relate this to our question about whether america is to blame. %$* 13
well— %$* 9
i think you probably can but— %$* 13
transformation of the mexican economy over the last several decades, i mean, america has a lot to do with that. %$* 9
and so i’m wondering if that transformation plays a role, in this drug violence, ‘cause a lotta these other factors, doing drugs, the transfer of guns, they seem fairly static, whereas, you know, the violence in mexico has increased tremendously over the last few years, what is not static, what is changing— %$* 9
okay. %$* 13
andrés martinez. %$* 13
well, i think it’s true that mexico has, really undergone a tremendous transformation, it’s a poor country compared to the us but it’s actually, if you look at it in global terms, it’s a fairly successful, relatively successful middle-income country plodding along, it’s just a stark contrast that it shares a border with the us.i think that the united states has opened up mexico’s economy through nafta and through other ways so, it probably has given—the mexican cartels have been able to take advantage of that—i don’t—i think it’s a little bit of a side issue to our main discussion here. %$* 451
but if you think about mexico becoming a logistical hub for this global enterprise, a lot of what’s changed in mexico has probably accelerated that and aided it. %$* 451
but— %$* 451
does this mean nafta is to blame for mexico’s drug war— %$* 13
but it’s— you know, i think just because it’s a lot easier for a lotta people in mexico now to do business, likewise for the drug cartels, but i think this is a bit of a side issue. %$* 451
okay. %$* 13
there’s a gentleman, with the eyeglasses, and your hand is up, doing one of these. %$* 13
and the mic’s coming down to you. %$* 13
and again i urge you to be %$* 13
question terse— %$* 13
hi, my name’s tony amato, i’m a penn state student. %$* 453
my question is to the panel that is motioning against. %$* 453
what i want to know is %$* 453
the amount of money that’s made in the drug trade, is astronomical. %$* 453
if you were to legalize or decriminalize or end prohibition on drugs, how would these drug cartels pay for this organization. %$* 453
i mean you did comment and say they, they could traffic people, they could traffic illegal goods, but the bulk of the money, comes from illegal drugs, so if you take the revenue stream out, how could they finance the, the organization, that’s what i’d like to know. %$* 453
okay, so jorge castañeda, why don’t you take that— %$* 13
well— %$* 452
—and asa, do you want to also— %$* 13
i think it would be very difficult for them to finance which is why i also favor growing decriminalization or depenalization, i think that it would help, it’s easy or relatively easy i think with the marijuana and heroin issues, cocaine and methamphetamine issues are complicated, they’re more complicated. %$* 452
but you can start with something and see where it goes. %$* 452
the main point is i think you’re absolutely right, a lot of the profits would diminish. %$* 452
they’d go into the other businesses, yes, that’s absolutely true what asa what saying. %$* 452
but the core business remains drugs. %$* 452
let’s not get that part wrong, that’s the core business, and if you legalize that then, yes, you will probably have them making less money. %$* 452
the other side care to respond, if not i’ll move on. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
the experience of us alcohol prohibition, was that the vast majority— %$* 449
jeffrey miron— %$* 13
—of the illegal alcohol producers, became legal alcohol producers, and there was not a big surge in violence as they went into some other industry because initially there were not other industries that were highly prohibited for which they could make a lot of profit, they had to make an honest living in legal industries and the rates of returns were modest. %$* 449
la cosa nostra, organized crime, came into existence and benefited tremendously after prohibition, they had plenty of work to do, organized crime in the united states, even after prohibition. %$* 448
from trafficking in drugs, which were illegal. %$* 449
well, they, in a whole— they— and a whole host— %$* 448
gentleman in the red tie? %$* 13
and if you can stand the mic will be handed over to you. %$* 13
the term “black market” invariably means, free markets that have been driven underground as mr. %$* 9
miron has eloquently demonstrated, particularly with the example of prohibition. %$* 9
that happens because of bad laws or i would say, immoral laws. %$* 9
mr. %$* 9
miron, can you relate, the discussion has been more on practical matters, this works, that doesn’t work. %$* 9
but this is a moral issue and it’s an issue of individual rights, can you relate %$* 9
the drug laws to individual rights and perhaps being a libertarian you might be able to relate it to the objectivist position. %$* 9
i’m actually more of a consequential libertarian than a rights-based libertarian, but we shouldn’t probably get into that— %$* 449
well, we’re getting some real inside libertarian baseball here. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 449
but i think that your question can be phrased in one of two ways, one way some people think about this issue of drug use is to say, individuals have rights to consume what they want, to do what they want as long as they’re not harming innocent third parties. %$* 449
a different way that people would say it is that, we should prohibit actions which negatively impact third parties without really using the word “rights.” we should let them consume what they want because it makes them happy, we don’t necessarily have to use those words, but they lead you to exactly the same positions. %$* 449
both the moral perspective and the sort of mundane, practical perspective. %$* 449
we think about what the policies are, the policies have different consequences, and you can include morality as one of those sets of consequences. %$* 449
but the libertarian position is we should look at all the sets of consequences, not just the feel-good consequences—not just the alleged consequences, say eliminating drug use, which in fact doesn’t happen—when we decide whether to criminalize drugs. %$* 449
i just, yes, right here. %$* 13
thank you, sir. %$* 13
i wonder if you look back on the history of drug abuse in this country, it feels not only an underground element, but it fuels other addictions—sexual addictions, it fuels the necessity, the necessity to try and buy drugs—regardless of what they cost. %$* 9
because the ultimate problem with drugs is that they cost money. %$* 9
and if you know, if we legalize ‘em, they are going to be more expensive than they are now, because the government will get involved in trying to %$* 9
of course, we put a %$* 9
sir, sir, how %$* 13
could %$* 13
yeah. %$* 9
with respect to your question %$* 13
well, what i want to say is %$* 9
how would you relate it to our, to our discussion? %$* 13
well, what %$* 9
the question is %$* 9
legalization of drugs is not going to change anything, and it’s not the reason for america’s blame on the mexican drug problem, or the mexican drug war. %$* 9
now what i want to understand from you people is %$* 9
.how do you feel that the legalization is going to make, all of a sudden, everything great? %$* 9
and no one is going to do drugs, and no one is going to create crimes, and nothing is going to happen that’s going to become more problems %$* 9
but you, i don’t think that’s what your point is here %$* 13
well, you %$* 9
well, let’s take a hack at it. %$* 13
you have a controlled experiment. %$* 447
it is very rare in history to have a very simple, controlled experiment—which was the prohibition of alcohol. %$* 447
and all these arguments were made—and that’s alcohol consumption did decline somewhat during prohibition, but it produced a vast criminal enterprise. %$* 447
it produced associated crimes in exactly the way you are describing. %$* 447
and then, once it was decriminalized, most of it—the vast majority of it—went away. %$* 447
so you know, nothing %$* 447
no analogy is perfect, but it’s very rare in history that you have actually, a case that’s about as close as you can get %$* 447
it’s very important also to point out, i think, for people thinking about this. %$* 447
there are many different ways you can decriminalize. %$* 447
you can decriminalize with, you know, medical use. %$* 447
you can decriminalize with a very strong public health campaign, the way we have done with tobacco. %$* 447
it can be even stronger in terms of the regulatory issues involved. %$* 447
so it %$* 447
that you can decriminalize some and not others. %$* 447
i do not agree that it is impossible to draw some lines. %$* 447
well, we draw lines all the time. %$* 447
alcohol is, at some level, a drug, and we have decriminalized it. %$* 447
so it is possible to do this in many different ways. %$* 447
we do have one historical example that’s pretty powerful. %$* 447
ok.just a little bit of radio business. %$* 13
we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i am john donvan. %$* 13
as moderator, we have six debaters—two teams of three— debating this motion: “america is to blame for mexico’s drug war.” i’d like to know, is there a question on the weapons issue, because we have chris cox here, and that is, that is his purview and that %$* 13
do i see a hand going up? %$* 13
yeah, yes, down in the %$* 13
the third row. %$* 13
i’ll bring a mike over to you. %$* 13
my name is alan borstein, and i have a pistol license for three pistols and five shotguns in my apartment on park avenue. %$* 454
i have not used any of them %$* 454
stand clear. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 454
go ahead. %$* 13
well, birds, which i eat. %$* 454
and, um %$* 454
i think the gun issue is a totally separate issue and maybe something for debate at some point as to how they should be controlled. %$* 454
as far as the drug issue is concerned, i think that taxing it would be a great help. %$* 454
and, i wonder if you think there are other ways to reduce consumption in the united states, besides the drug war and what %$* 454
all right, fair question. %$* 13
since %$* 13
and why don’t you take that, uh, jeffrey? %$* 13
there are certainly possibilities for reducing use of any substance that we legalize, relative to what you would get otherwise. %$* 449
minimum purchase ages might have some effect, although the evidence suggests they have relatively minor effects. %$* 449
a tax is almost certainly the most effective way, because that unambiguously raises the price. %$* 449
but there are clearly limits to what you can do with the tax, because if you make the tax high, try to make the price really high, you drive the market back underground. %$* 449
so the accurate view is—you can adjust how much people consume somewhat, but you can’t fundamentally change the fact that people are going to use these substances. %$* 449
and whether you are getting the people you would like to discourage to stop using is much, much less clear. %$* 449
in particular, by making it illegal, people who have no respect for the law are likely the ones who go ahead and consume it anyway. %$* 449
the people who are likely the responsible users—the ones who might do it in moderation were it legal—are the ones who are deterred, so that’s exactly backwards under a policy of prohibition. %$* 449
there is a gentleman with a %$* 13
waving a green card? %$* 13
the mike is coming to you. %$* 13
thank you, good evening. %$* 455
i have been an avid reader of jorge castañeda for years and years. %$* 455
and aside of his very well recommended agenda against president calderón, he tried to change the terms of the debate tonight and put the blame on president calderón. %$* 455
to me, it is crazy for president calderón to wage a war the way he is doing. %$* 455
he is very courageous and i applaud him. %$* 455
and today, jorge failed to present a side—just throwing punches against the president of mexico—for him to present an alternative. %$* 455
he failed tonight. %$* 455
he failed in his recent book. %$* 455
i would like to hear something, a real proposal like this—without the comprehensive, comprehensive strategy against president calderón. %$* 455
thank you. %$* 455
well, do you really want to take that, ‘cause i am %$* 13
yes. %$* 452
willing to give a pass on that %$* 13
no. %$* 452
no. %$* 452
i am very glad to hear my very good friend, ruben beltran, the consul general of mexico in new york, defend the government he works for. %$* 452
but %$* 452
in the interest of full disclosure %$* 452
ruben, it’s always better to be as open as possible on these matters %$* 452
yeah. %$* 13

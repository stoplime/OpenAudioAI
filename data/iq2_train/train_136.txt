thank you. %$* 13
normally, robert, you introduce me but i'll do it myself. %$* 13
i'm really sorry. %$* 1
i was waiting for my cue. %$* 13
i was waiting for that too, i'm sorry. %$* 1
well, now john, over to you. %$* 1
that worked so perfectly. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz to make this all possible. %$* 13
welcome everyone to another debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan of abc news and, once again, i have the honor of moderating as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the skirball center for the performing arts of new york university; six debaters, three against three will be debating this motion, don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
parse out that language that means that if you vote for the motion, you’re voting for exonerating teachers unions. %$* 13
if you vote against the motion, you’re voting for-- %$* 13
you blame teachers unions. %$* 13
i'll rephrase that. %$* 13
you blame teachers' unions if you’re voting against the motion. %$* 13
now, this is a debate and i'm the referee but you, the audience, are actually the judges. %$* 13
you will have been asked by the time this debate ends to vote twice, once before and once after debate to tell us where you stand on this motion. %$* 13
and after hearing the arguments and the second vote, the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so let's go now to the vote and the right-hand side of your seat there is a key pad. %$* 13
read this motion closely because the language is a little bit challenging. %$* 13
if you are for the motion, push number one. %$* 13
and for the motion means you exonerate teachers unions. %$* 13
if you are against the motion, push number two. %$* 13
this means that you blame teachers unions for the failure of the schools. %$* 13
if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you feel that you've made an error in your selection, just push the correct number and it will lock into the most recent-- %$* 13
your last vote will actually be the one that is recorded. %$* 13
so we'll tally those votes in a few minutes. %$* 13
and somewhat into our opening round i will tell you what the first results. %$* 13
i also wanted to share a very brief personal note that i'm going to declare irrelevant, that my grandfather was a new york city public school teacher. %$* 13
so was my father. %$* 13
so was my mother. %$* 13
and so was my 93 year old aunt grace who even now is living in the bronx. %$* 13
i will make all of this irrelevant. %$* 13
because that is my job, to be neutral and to moderate. %$* 13
so let's get on with round one of our debate, opening statements by each debater. %$* 13
in turn, they will be seven minutes each, uninterrupted and speaking first for the motion i'd like to introduce randi weingarten who is the president of the american federation of teachers, the country's second largest teachers union and i believe also you have new york city school teachers in your heritage. %$* 13
absolutely. %$* 402
many, many of them. %$* 402
ladies and gentlemen, randi weingarten. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 402
thank you, bloomberg. %$* 402
thank you, npr and thank you, mr. %$* 402
rosenkranz. %$* 402
look, we have a double challenge today in america. %$* 402
one is the need to compete in a global economy, an economy that has changed hugely even as many of us have been wrestling with it. %$* 402
number two, we have the effects of the global recession: state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now. %$* 402
and so when the investment is very, very bleak, as it is right now, and the need is very, very great, it's no wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame. %$* 402
but my friends, blaming unions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession. %$* 402
ultimately what humans do-- %$* 402
what our union does proudly is have a mantra. %$* 402
what is good for kids and what is fair for teachers. %$* 402
now, am i saying that everything we've ever done is the right thing? %$* 402
absolutely not. %$* 402
am i saying that we are perfect? %$* 402
absolutely not. %$* 402
but what we are trying to do in this very, very turbulent time is search for what works. %$* 402
search for what works for kids. %$* 402
let me ask-- %$* 402
let me suggest this. %$* 402
if teachers unions were to be blamed for failing schools, then we would assume that schools in less unionized states would outperform schools in more densely unionized states. %$* 402
so you'd assume that places like mississippi, alabama, louisiana, who have relatively few unionized teachers would do much, much better. %$* 402
but that's not the case. %$* 402
the states with the most densely unionized teachers, massachusetts, new york, maryland; they do the best. %$* 402
and the countries with the most densely unionized populations: finland, japan, they do the best. %$* 402
so what do we learn from that? %$* 402
what we know is that there are problems like mr. %$* 402
rosenkranz said. %$* 402
there are problems we have to solve. %$* 402
one of which is poverty. %$* 402
states like alabama, louisiana, mississippi; they have and had been plagued by tremendous poverty. %$* 402
we have to compete with poverty. %$* 402
that's what public education is and that is what the search we have for, that's what our search is, to find what works. %$* 402
so you felt, i hope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions, to problem solving. %$* 402
and i would argue to all of you that having a strong union, someone in an entity that will look at what it's done right and what it's done wrong, and solve things and change things, is the way to go. %$* 402
so what works? %$* 402
what can we learn from places like maryland, massachusetts, new york state, finland, and japan? %$* 402
this is what we can learn. %$* 402
this is what works. %$* 402
what works in places where we don't as terry moe will probably argue, where we don't have niche markets, where we can't marketize our schools, where we have to help all kids. %$* 402
so we need well-prepared and supported teachers. %$* 402
we need well- rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around. %$* 402
we need to invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction. %$* 402
we also need things like early childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school. %$* 402
and finally, we need good services to help level the playing field for kids. %$* 402
now, is this a panacea? %$* 402
is this something that has never happened and it's a search for something we don't know how to find? %$* 402
no. %$* 402
we find these elements in lots of different places. %$* 402
and the glue that binds us together, the difference between the places that work and the places that don't are good labor management relationships. %$* 402
like we see in one of my other panelists here, in the abc school district in california which has lifted its scores, which has changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative. %$* 402
does that mean as i said before that we've done everything. %$* 402
of course not. %$* 402
everyone has to take more responsibility in this day and age. %$* 402
if we're going to ensure that all kids are ready for life, for college, for career, that means that-- %$* 402
that means we all have to take collective responsibility. %$* 402
and we, at the a.f.t., attempted to do that in any number of ways: first, in pushing for common standards, including the new common core curriculum or the common core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments, in pushing for better curriculum. %$* 402
and in looking at ourselves and saying look, we have to have a new approach to due process. %$* 402
we can't have rubber rooms anymore. %$* 402
we can't have a choice between off with your heads and warehousing. %$* 402
we can't have situations where if there is incompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen. %$* 402
we have to have more evaluation systems that are fair, that are meaningful, that are competent, and that actually help teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now. %$* 402
but we also have to give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good job with kids. %$* 402
because at the end of the day, to compete with poverty, to drift all boats, to make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it, it comes with initially that connection between teacher and kid. %$* 402
that connection we made every day that we teach. %$* 402
that connection i made with my kids at clara barton high school that i know gary made when he taught. %$* 402
i know kate made when she teaches. %$* 402
we need teachers to have the support of the people around us and the unions. %$* 402
the unions-- %$* 402
all of us. %$* 402
the unions will do everything in their power to help fight for the tools and the conditions that teachers need and to fight to ensure that every kid, every kid gets a well prepared and well supported teacher. %$* 402
thank you very much. %$* 402
thank you, randi weingarten. %$* 13
the motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
and now to argue against the motion because he does blame teachers unions for the failure of the schools, i'd like to introduce terry moe of the hoover institution whose book almost 20 years ago titled "politics, markets and america's schools," was full of ideas it seemed radical at the time, and that since then have become actually part of school systems, experimental school systems throughout the country. %$* 13
i don't know whether it's been the pace you would like, terry. %$* 13
it's been 20 years. %$* 13
only 20 years. %$* 403
okay, ladies and gentlemen, terry moe. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 403
it's great to be here. %$* 403
i want to thank intelligence squared for arranging this event and for putting the spotlight on what, in my view, is the most important issue in american education today, the power of the teachers unions. %$* 403
i should be clear that our team is not saying that the teachers unions are responsible for every problem of the public schools. %$* 403
what we are saying is that the unions are and have long been major obstacles to real reform in the system. %$* 403
and we're hardly alone in saying this. %$* 403
if you read “newsweek,” “time magazine,” the “washington post,” lots of other well- respected publications, they're all saying the same thing: that the teachers unions are standing in the way of progress. %$* 403
so look. %$* 403
let me start with an obvious example. %$* 403
the teachers unions have fought for all sorts of protections in labor contracts and in state laws that make it virtually impossible to get bad teachers out of the classroom. %$* 403
on average, it takes two years, $200,000, and 15% of the principal's total time to get one bad teacher out of the classroom. %$* 403
as a result, principals don't even try. %$* 403
they give 99% of teachers-- %$* 403
no joke-- %$* 403
satisfactory evaluations. %$* 403
the bad teachers just stay in the classroom. %$* 403
well, if we figure that maybe 5% of the teachers, that's a conservative estimate, are bad teachers nationwide, that means that 2.5 million kids are stuck in classrooms with teachers who aren't teaching them anything. %$* 403
this is devastating. %$* 403
and the unions are largely responsible for that. %$* 403
they're also responsible for seniority provisions in these labor contracts that among other things often allow senior teachers to stake a claim to desirable jobs, even if they're not good teachers and even if they're a bad fit for that school. %$* 403
the seniority rules often require districts to lay off junior people before senior people. %$* 403
it's happening all around the country now. %$* 403
and some of these junior people are some of the best teachers in the district. %$* 403
and some of the senior people that are being saved are the worst. %$* 403
okay. %$* 403
so just ask yourself, would anyone in his right mind organize schools in this way, if all they cared about was what's best for kids? %$* 403
and the answer is no. %$* 403
but this is the way our schools are actually organized. %$* 403
and it's due largely to the power of the unions. %$* 403
now, these organizational issues are really important, but they're just part of a larger set of problems. %$* 403
our nation has been trying to reform the schools since the early 1980s. %$* 403
and the whole time the teachers' unions have used their extraordinary power in the political process to try to block reform and make sure that real reform just never happens. %$* 403
consider charter schools. %$* 403
there are many kids around this country who are stuck in schools that just aren't teaching them. %$* 403
they need new options. %$* 403
well, charter schools can provide them with those options. %$* 403
but charter schools are a threat to teachers' unions. %$* 403
if you give kids choice and they can leave regular public schools, then they take money and they take jobs with them. %$* 403
and that's what the teachers' unions want to stop. %$* 403
so what they've done is they've used their power in the political process to put a ceiling on the numbers of charter schools. %$* 403
as a result in this country today, we have 4,600 charter schools. %$* 403
there are like well over 90,000 public schools. %$* 403
so this is a drop in the bucket. %$* 403
and mean time charter schools have huge waiting lists of people who are desperate to get in. %$* 403
in harlem, for example, the charter schools there got 11,000 applications for 2,000 slots recently. %$* 403
so just to give you an idea of about how the politics of this works out, in detroit a few years ago, a benefactor came forth and said he was willing to donate $200 million to set up additional charter schools for the kids in detroit who obviously need it. %$* 403
what did the union do? %$* 403
the union went ballistic. %$* 403
they shut down the schools, went to lansing, demonstrated in the state capitol and got the politicians to turn down the $200 million for those kids. %$* 403
this is good for kids? %$* 403
i don't think so. %$* 403
this is about protecting jobs. %$* 403
the same kind of logic applies with accountability. %$* 403
accountability is just common sense. %$* 403
we obviously need to hold schools and teachers accountability for teaching kids what they're supposed to know. %$* 403
but the teachers' unions find this threatening. %$* 403
they say they support accountability but they don't want teachers held accountable. %$* 403
any sensible effort to hold teachers accountable, they brand as scapegoating teachers. %$* 403
they don't even want teachers performance to be measured. %$* 403
right here in new york city, joel klein indicated a while ago that he was going to use student test scores as one factor in evaluating teachers for tenure. %$* 403
what did the union do? %$* 403
now, this is something that obama supports, that arne duncan supports. %$* 403
it's unbelievable. %$* 403
what the union did is they went to albany and they got their friends in the legislature to pass a law making it illegal to use student test scores in evaluating teachers for tenure anywhere in the state of new york. %$* 403
it's just outrageous. %$* 403
and makes no sense from the standpoint of what's best for kids. %$* 403
the “new york times” called it absurd. %$* 403
this is how the unions approach accountability. %$* 403
okay, well, i don't have a whole lot of time left here. %$* 403
so let me just quickly say our opponents are going to say tonight, and randi has already said, there is really no conflict between standing up for the jobs of teachers and doing what's best for kids. %$* 403
but the thing is there is a conflict. %$* 403
and that's why we can't get bad teachers out of the classroom, because they protect them. %$* 403
that's why the schools have totally perverse organizations imposed on them, and that's why totally sensible reforms are seriously resisted in the political process. %$* 403
now, what you're going to hear, i'm sure, throughout the evening is that union leaders and unions around the country, they're actually reformers too. %$* 403
they want to get bad teachers out of the classroom. %$* 403
they say they're for charter schools; they're all in favor of accountability. %$* 403
well, not really. %$* 403
talk is cheap. %$* 403
what counts is what they actually do. %$* 403
and what they do is to oppose reform. %$* 403
this is the reality. %$* 403
thank you. %$* 403
thank you, terry moe. %$* 13
our motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce our second debater speaking for the motion, not to blame teachers. %$* 13
kate mclaughlin is an elementary school teacher in lowell, massachusetts, at the moment our only active teacher in the debate tonight. %$* 13
kate, i understand you've moved on to being a math coach for kids? %$* 13
yes. %$* 404
do you teach-- %$* 13
i teach children and teachers, kindergarten through fourth grade. %$* 404
thanks very much for joining us tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kate mclaughlin. %$* 13
good evening, everyone. %$* 404
i too, would like to thank the rosenkranz foundation especially for having a teacher come and speak because it is a rare occasion for a teacher to actually be able to talk about education. %$* 404
it's usually think tanks and professors and others. %$* 404
so i'm really privileged to be here tonight. %$* 404
thank you. %$* 404
the first time i heard about this, don't blame teachers' unions, i, too, thought like randi. %$* 404
i'm from the common wealth of massachusetts. %$* 404
which i'm very proud to say is number one in the country. %$* 404
our students perform higher than anybody else in this country academically. %$* 404
yet we have the strongest collective bargaining rights in the country. %$* 404
so do me it just doesn't add up. %$* 404
and then i started thinking i'm also a doctoral student so i'm trying to learn as much as i can about research and so the next thing i did is i went straight to the literature. %$* 404
even professor moe said publications are all saying the same thing. %$* 404
there is no research to support what he is saying. %$* 404
there is no research out there that correlates student achievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism, either for or against. %$* 404
there is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want. %$* 404
and publicize. %$* 404
it doesn't mean that it's research-based. %$* 404
so with that, what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools? %$* 404
and i have a lot to say. %$* 404
not only am i a teacher, i'm the executive vice-president of the united teachers of lowell, and i deal with this firsthand as a union leader. %$* 404
and for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot. %$* 404
and the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also for children. %$* 404
so one example of that, which unfortunately in my district-- %$* 404
my union has not been able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes. %$* 404
so early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract. %$* 404
that's just one example. %$* 404
the other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom. %$* 404
what that means is there are times as a teacher that i need to advocate for the child. %$* 404
and that means i have to say something unpopular, something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and i need to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that i can be. %$* 404
and i need to be able to do that without fear. %$* 404
and that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children. %$* 404
and that is why it's important. %$* 404
besides families, no one cares more about students and their learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers. %$* 404
and what the teachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers. %$* 404
so while my opponents on the motion might say that i have my own agenda, i would argue that is absolutely not true. %$* 404
my agenda is the agenda of the teachers. %$* 404
what the teachers need. %$* 404
so the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and the superintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done. %$* 404
we survey our members. %$* 404
and what they need in their classrooms is our agenda. %$* 404
so for example one thing that we've done is we've created what's been called-- %$* 404
the department of education in massachusetts has been called the cadillac teacher induction program. %$* 404
so the union and management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor. %$* 404
they have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in lowell who often come with second language issues, they have full training in what they need. %$* 404
also with that, the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not. %$* 404
and to counsel them perhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting the children's need. %$* 404
and also, to help them make better choices. %$* 404
another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract, we call the lowell program. %$* 404
it's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master's degree. %$* 404
again, the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need. %$* 404
in terms of evaluations, our evaluation procedures in lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required by state standard. %$* 404
so our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the state only mandates once. %$* 404
so in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it's just not true. %$* 404
the most important thing in my opinion about what we've done-- %$* 404
and i can't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, i was only in high school, but i can speak to what's happening in schools now. %$* 404
and what we are doing is this labor management union. %$* 404
because with all due respect, we have been-- %$* 404
the teachers have been told what to do. %$* 404
we've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants, and we found-- %$* 404
the teachers found they were not working for children. %$* 404
we've told what to do. %$* 404
now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making. %$* 404
and so in lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children. %$* 404
so it is, indeed, what is best for them. %$* 404
thank you. %$* 404
thank you, kate mclaughlin. %$* 13
here is where we are on the debate. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
acting as moderator, we have six debaters: three against three fighting it out over this motion. %$* 13
don't blame teachers' unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
we've heard from three debaters three opening statements. %$* 13
and now on to our fourth to speak against the motion i'd like to introduce rod paige who is famously the u.s. secretary of education under the bush administration, even more famously once called teachers unions terrorist groups. %$* 13
i knew that was going to come up. %$* 405
it has to come up. %$* 13
and also his own background in education, he is the son of a school principal in rural mississippi who, to make ends meet, also worked as a barber, i believe, is that correct, rod? %$* 13
that's correct. %$* 405
and how times have changed. %$* 13
or perhaps they have not. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, rod paige. %$* 13
good evening, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 405
i'm here to convince you to vote against this proposition. %$* 405
all of us know that teachers are not solely to blame for our failing schools. %$* 405
but they bear significant responsibility and the way this is framed, the only way to express that is to vote against this proposition. %$* 405
now, to understand my point of view, you have to realize how powerful these organizations are. %$* 405
to be blunt, teachers unions represent the most dominant political force in american education. %$* 405
we're not talking about little wimpy organizations. %$* 405
we're talking about mammoth highly financed, highly organized, highly peopled organizations. %$* 405
and political dominance is not something that they got unintentionally. %$* 405
they intended to be politically dominant. %$* 405
here is a quote from sam lambert in 1967 about nea. nea would become the political-- %$* 405
become a political power second to no other special interest group. %$* 405
listen to those words. %$* 405
people could argue now that they've already reached that goal. %$* 405
teacher unions represent the number one political spender in the united states of america. %$* 405
in the state of california, the nea spent more in the last decades than any other political spender and the second political spender spent less by a little bitter than 1/2 of what the nea spent. %$* 405
these are powerful, dominant organizations. %$* 405
the nea has 3.2 million members, 14,000 locals across the united states, and last year-- %$* 405
in 2007 they collected about $400 million from their members to supplement the other revenue streams that they had. %$* 405
the aft is not a slouch either. %$* 405
they have 1.4 million members, 300 locals across the united states. %$* 405
and they're active in 43 states. %$* 405
nea has state offices in every state in the united states. %$* 405
and that's not all. %$* 405
they can call on their political partners when they get in trouble. %$* 405
they can call on the afl-cio.they can call on acorn. %$* 405
they can call on people for the american way. %$* 405
they can call on the center for community change. %$* 405
these are mammoth organizations and i need for you to understand that in order to understand why we take this position. %$* 405
now, the american workforce, about 12% of the workforce is unionized. %$* 405
but in the education profession, it's 38%.teachers' unions literally have our schools in a chokehold. %$* 405
this is completely dangerous. %$* 405
now, power corrupts. %$* 405
total power corrupts totally. %$* 405
you need to be clear about how they use this power. %$* 405
to try to convince people-- %$* 405
you heard a lot tonight about children and their members. %$* 405
don't be fooled. %$* 405
organizations have one primary interest. %$* 405
they may have some other interests but they have one main interest. %$* 405
teachers' unions’ main interest is the welfare of their members. %$* 405
another quote from nea operative, “the main purpose of our association”-- %$* 405
note the word association. %$* 405
they don't even call themselves unions. %$* 405
it’s not the education of children, but rather it is all to be the extension and preservation of our members' rights. %$* 405
now, that's just a statement of fact. %$* 405
organizations can't serve 2 gods, little “g.” they serve one. %$* 405
and in the case of teachers' unions, it is the interests of their members. %$* 405
now, let me tell you a live story. %$* 405
in 2000, a buffalo school district had about 7,000 members and they were the most unionized public school system in the united states of america. %$* 405
and 7:00 a.m., on a school day, the leaders of the teachers' unions still on the buffalo headquarters step called a strike at 7:00 a.m. %$* 405
on a school day. %$* 405
now, many children already are on buses on the way to school. %$* 405
many parents have already dropped kids off at school leaving their kids in the love care of teachers. %$* 405
mistakenly. %$* 405
does that sound like an organization that cares about kids? %$* 405
they were arguing for employee rights. %$* 405
two more major points that really tick me off to some extent. %$* 405
teachers unions are sitting on both sides of the negotiating table in many cases. %$* 405
they-- %$* 405
teachers unions work with school boards so that they have representatives on the school boards. %$* 405
when i served as superintendent of houston, one of my nine school board employees, actually an employee of the teachers unions, fortunately for me, both were reasonable people and we got along rather well. %$* 405
but many school district superintendents don't have that luxury. %$* 405
they have school-- %$* 405
they have school boards that have teachers unions representatives sitting on that side of the table; the unions sitting on this side of the table. %$* 405
they're negotiating with themselves. %$* 405
they're sitting on both sides of the negotiating table. %$* 405
here is the worst thing, i think, that really fires me up. %$* 405
teachers unions have awesome power to cause action in schools. %$* 405
they have zero responsibility for their student performance. %$* 405
that's just not fair. %$* 405
that's not fair. %$* 405
it handicaps the principals and the superintendents who are operating with both hands tied behind their back. %$* 405
the teachers unions are calling the rules. %$* 405
they're responsible for student achievement. %$* 405
that's no way to run a ship. %$* 405
and it simply will not work that way. %$* 405
now, here again, i want to be honest and i want to be fair. %$* 405
we can't solely blame teachers unions for these complex issues we have in our school situation but they do bear significant responsibility. %$* 405
and the only way you can express that is to vote against this motion to indicate that we are the nation. %$* 405
if we're going to really reform our schools, we're going to have to wind back from the power of teachers unions. %$* 405
we can still have teachers unions. %$* 405
we're not arguing that we shouldn't have teachers unions. %$* 405
our schools are over unionized and consequently reform has run into a road block. %$* 405
thank you very much. %$* 405
thank you, rod paige. %$* 13
the motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools and now to speak for the motion-- %$* 13
and we just heard rod paige say that superintendents have their hands tied by the unions. %$* 13
well, gary smuts is a school superintendent of the abc unified district in california, considered a district where the schools work and gary, you have said in the past you do work effectively and successfully with unions. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, larry smuts. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 13
i need to correct that for the record. %$* 13
because it's not larry, it's gary. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, gary smuts. %$* 13
both of us are here tonight. %$* 406
secretary paige, in a wonderful book he wrote with his sister, dr. %$* 406
elaine witty, it was entitled "the black/white achievement gap: why closing it is the greatest civil rights issue of our time." he says in the book, "being taught to higher levels means educational support from factors outside of school. %$* 406
it involves the support and commitment from the entire education triage: home, school, and community." and secretary paige's call to improve the effectiveness of our schools recalls an article co-written by professor moe entitled, "letting schools work." in that article, professor moe reports, "effective schools treat teachers professionally. %$* 406
the teachers share in the school's goals and effective teaching in the pursuit of those goals. %$* 406
they participate extensively in school decisions within their classrooms. %$* 406
they are free to tailor their practices to the needs of their students, that effective schools are organized like teams held together by consensus, cooperation, and shared goals." it sounds like a teacher's union to me. %$* 406
thank you, professor moe. %$* 406
now, i must clearly delineate my prejudice, my frame of reference. %$* 406
i am from the abc unified school district, southern california, about 21,000 students. %$* 406
we're about 89% diverse, 38 different languages spoken in my school district. %$* 406
we have a remarkable relationship with our affiliate, the abc-aft.we're affiliated with the national american federation of teachers, second largest teachers union in the united states. %$* 406
we've formed our own charter and abc is not a charter school. %$* 406
we have a charter partnership agreement with the abc/aft where the main work of the teachers' union in my district is student achievement and the conditions that support that. %$* 406
student achievement is the main work of our teachers' union. %$* 406
in fact, last year, laura rico, the president of my teachers' union had a workshop where all the union reps came in and they changed their name from union rep to learning rep. %$* 406
and they were told by the teachers' union president the number one job that you have in this union is student achievement. %$* 406
now, that doesn't sound like a teacher's union that has anything other than their main goal, the main idea that secretary paige talked about-- %$* 406
in my district, our union, and student achievement. %$* 406
here are some examples of staff development in my district that's jointly sponsored by myself and our colleagues, american federation of teachers. %$* 406
it doesn't-- %$* 406
what i'm going to describe to you actually comes from the national aft, from their educational research and dissemination program. %$* 406
these are some of the courses that are caught by our teacher's union: instructional strategies that work; reading comprehension; school, family, and community partnerships supporting student learning, which is actually almost exactly what secretary paige points out in his book that we need to improve schools. %$* 406
we spend-- %$* 406
actually my teacher's union spends 10s of thousands of dollars in direct staff development with our community and our teachers to improve learning. %$* 406
now, don't blame my district's union for failing schools. %$* 406
they're one of the reasons my district is successful. %$* 406
now, we have our challenges. %$* 406
we're a program improvement district. %$* 406
last year, despite $34 million in budget cuts, we doubled the greatest gains in the history of the district. %$* 406
we passed the magic benchmark of 814-- %$* 406
800, actually in california, went to 814.we didn't do that despite the teacher's union. %$* 406
we did that because of the teacher's union. %$* 406
let me give you an example. %$* 406
in my district, 10 of my schools-- %$* 406
these are struggling schools that have just received an innovation grant where each of these schools has a separate program to innovate and improve that school specifically tailored to the needs of that individual school. %$* 406
that innovation grant came from the american federation of teachers national organization. %$* 406
$3.3 million in innovation grants funded the abc unified school district, 10 of our 30 schools. %$* 406
that's not just in california or abc.actually, the grant funded programs and districts in 8 different states. %$* 406
the american federation of teachers national organization is one of the most innovative programs in the united states. %$* 406
now, some of the things that those innovation grants are funding in my district, i said partnership efforts in 10 schools. %$* 406
in other districts throughout the united states, they're working on community partnerships, working on using student assessment data to evaluate teachers. %$* 406
they're also working on creating charter schools. %$* 406
so if you're for charters, if you're for holding teachers accountable, using student assessment data, listen to the american federation of teachers. %$* 406
now, secretary paige, randi weingarten agrees with you. %$* 406
that great teachers make the real difference in closing the achievement gap. %$* 406
in fact, the “washington post” reported in january that randi said, "fair, transparent, and expedient processes to identify and deal with ineffective teachers need to be developed." and she specifically pointed to student assessment data. %$* 406
now, her direction was put in action most recently in the new haven federation of teachers district by a vote of 842 to 39.that district agreed to use student assessment data to evaluate teachers. %$* 406
in addition, they agreed that the city could close schools if they didn't work and change the employees. %$* 406
now, twice each year american federation of teachers hosts the shanker institute. %$* 406
i have been proud to be part of that since 2005.let me tell you what we learned at the shanker institute. %$* 406
these are different workshops: state standards curriculum bridging the gap, partnering for a reform in troubled times, improving the quality and the use of student assessment data. %$* 406
the unions’ role in assuring that teacher quality matters-- %$* 406
teacher quality meets student needs. %$* 406
in every seminar i have been to, there has never been a session on how to keep crummy teachers. %$* 406
they don't do that. %$* 406
and in fact, in most cases, the superintendents i know that work closely with teachers unions find that we release more teachers to other industries than we do keeping them. %$* 406
in fact, in nearby brooklyn, there is the united federation of teacher institute. %$* 406
they do much the same thing. %$* 406
they use data, talk about communication, team building, professional development and action plans. %$* 406
states with teachers unions set the highest standards, according to “education week.” “u.s. news and world report” reported on the most-- %$* 406
25 most successful schools. %$* 406
six out of 10 of those schools come from states with strong teacher's unions. %$* 406
success, high standards, accountability. %$* 406
if you want that, support teacher's unions in schools where that works. %$* 406
thank you, gary smuts. %$* 13
now we have our larry. %$* 13
that's where i got mixed up. %$* 13
i'd like to introduce to speak against the motion-- %$* 13
and our motion is don't blame teachers unions for our failing schools-- %$* 13
our next debater does blame teachers unions for our failing schools. %$* 13
larry sand is a retired teacher and former teachers union member who grew disillusioned with the operation. %$* 13
he founded the california teacher's empowerment network, and i've seen you described, larry, in print as a pain in the union's back side. %$* 13
i assume we'll see why. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, larry sand. %$* 13
i'm glad gary brought up mr. %$* 407
shanker, because he is alleged to have said when school children start paying dues, that's when i'll start representing them. %$* 407
now, i don't know if he did say that. %$* 407
some people think he did, some say no. %$* 407
but that has been the teacher's union attitude ever since i began my teaching career here in new york city in 1971.in educating children, there is nothing more valuable than a dedicated and gifted teacher and nothing more harmful and destructive than a bad one. %$* 407
and it's those teachers, the mediocre and the incompetent ones that the unions typically represent. %$* 407
in fact, they punish good teachers in numerous ways. %$* 407
unions insist that school districts not pay good teachers what they're worth. %$* 407
they insist on an archaic factory model of payment whereby teachers make more money by years on the job-- %$* 407
not productive years, just by calendar progression. %$* 407
consider the greatest teacher of our time, jaime escalante, subject of the film “stand and deliver,” now unfortunately near death in his native bolivia; attracted national attention at garfield high school in los angeles with his spectacular success teaching college level calculus to gang members and other unteachables. %$* 407
talk about poor students. %$* 407
what was the problem? %$* 407
because he was willing to have more students in his class than the united teachers of los angeles contract allowed for, he was basically run out of town by that union. %$* 407
when there are layoffs due to budget cuts, do the worst teachers get laid off? %$* 407
no. %$* 407
do the permanents or tenure, a union must in every contract, the newest hires are let go. %$* 407
you're a teacher of the year? %$* 407
too bad. %$* 407
you're double test scores? %$* 407
too bad. %$* 407
but the unions will go to any length, any length to save the job of a bad tenured teacher. %$* 407
if you think i'm exaggerating, here is a quote from an la union rep. %$* 407
if i'm representing them it's impossible to get them out. %$* 407
it's impossible unless they commit a lewd act. %$* 407
end quote. %$* 407
and maybe not even then. %$* 407
you're laughing. %$* 407
this is a true story and this didn't happen very long ago. %$* 407
was a former colleague, he's alleged to have touched a female student inappropriately. %$* 407
there are witnesses. %$* 407
the female student would not press charges. %$* 407
so they put x into the district office for a while, the so-called rubber room, which probably most of you know of. %$* 407
they decided to put him, by the union lore, they put him in another school. %$* 407
he apparently did the same thing. %$* 407
back to the rubber room: sitting, sitting. %$* 407
finally, one day, i guess he got bored. %$* 407

so i want to welcome to the stage-- %$* 13
just want to make sure i have titles correct, although i know the gentleman personally. %$* 13
nicholas quinn rosenkranz, he is director of the rosenkranz foundation and a professor at georgetown university. %$* 13
and jeffrey rosen, he is president and ceo of the national constitution center and a professor at the george washington university law school. %$* 13
please welcome them to the stage. %$* 13
there you go. %$* 13
you can sit down and grab a mic. %$* 13
jeffrey rosen. %$* 13
i want to start with you. %$* 13
first let's talk a bit about the exhibit downstairs because it relates directly to what we're doing here tonight. %$* 13
it's so exciting. %$* 49
you, ladies and gentlemen, are the first people in the united states to have seen the first exhibit in the united states that describes the constitutional evolution of gay rights in the courts. %$* 49
and what's so exciting about this exhibit is that it examines a constitutional question, not a political question, and presents all sides. %$* 49
and it shows how courts have changed their views about the status of gay rights. %$* 49
and it culminates in-- %$* 49
at the end, asking you to vote about whether or not you think that the constitution requires the states to recognize marriage equality. %$* 49
and that is the very question that you're going to be voting on tonight. %$* 49
and the timing of both the exhibit and this debate, just weeks before the supreme court is expected to hand down a landmark decision about the meaning of gay rights in the constitution, couldn't be better. %$* 49
and, jeffrey, just take a moment to explain that point, that this is a debate where everybody has a view, they have their own sources of information, their own value systems. %$* 13
but we're looking at it deliberately through a very, very specific lens tonight. %$* 13
yes. %$* 49
this is going to be a constitutional debate, not a political debate. %$* 49
and when i started at the national constitution center two years ago, i think during my first weeks i went to see nick rosenkranz, my friend and fellow law professor in dc. %$* 49
and i said, and he agreed-- %$* 49
we both had a meeting of minds-- %$* 49
let's have a special series between the national constitution center and intelligence squared that will have constitutional debates and not political debates. %$* 49
what does that mean tonight? %$* 49
it means that you might believe that marriage equality is a fundamentally moral and necessary policy matter. %$* 49
but you don't think that the constitution requires it. %$* 49
or, conversely, you might think that marriage equality is a really bad idea, and you'd like to preserve tradition, but you do think that the constitution requires the states to accept it. %$* 49
so what nick and i are trying to do with this series-- %$* 49
which i think is among the best things that the national constitution center is doing, i'm prouder of our collaboration than anything else we're doing-- %$* 49
we're going around the country, debating issues in constitutional, not political, terms, from nsa surveillance to campaign finance reform. %$* 49
we're asking you to think not what you believe is a policy matter but what you think the constitution requires or does not require. %$* 49
and that's the way i'd like you to view this debate tonight, recognize there are good arguments on both sides of this question, have an open mind, and vote for the side that you find most constitutionally persuasive. %$* 49
so in a sense it's what lawyers would have to be saying to judges to make the case. %$* 13
and nick rosenkranz is going to now share-- %$* 13
share with us some of what-- %$* 13
give us an-- %$* 13
a sense of a glossary of terms and concepts that would help us ease into this framework. %$* 13
sure, so just a few things you might want to keep your eye on during this debate, i'll leave the substance to the debaters, but you'll see the equal protection clause up on the screen. %$* 67
the first thing, of course, is pay careful attention to the text of the constitution. %$* 67
that's going to be the most important touchstone for us. %$* 67
second thing to keep your eye on is the role of history. %$* 67
so, of course, traditional marriages existed for millennia. %$* 67
and in 1868, when the equal protection clause was ratified, when the 14th amendment was ratified, gay marriage was literally unthinkable, inconceivable. %$* 67
does that matter? %$* 67
what role should that play in our analysis of the meaning of the equal protection clause? %$* 67
just an important thing to keep your eye on. %$* 67
another thing you might want to keep your eye on is quite what kind of equality are we talking about? %$* 67
this debate has really been framed in terms of-- %$* 67
or the supreme court case has been framed in terms of equality between gay people and straight people. %$* 67
but consider the law never actually makes a distinction based on whether or not you are gay. %$* 67
the law never says, "you can't marry steve because you're gay." the law says, "you can't marry steve because of your gender." and does that matter? %$* 67
should this really be-- %$* 67
should we be talking about this as a matter of gender equality more than as a matter of sexual orientation equality? %$* 67
what do we think about that? %$* 67
and just keep your eye on that. %$* 67
and then, you know, a third thing you might want to keep your eye on is at bottom this question, like all constitutional questions, is a matter of who decides, who's going to get to make this choice here in the united states? %$* 67
most things here in the united states are left to democracy. %$* 67
for most things, state legislatures get to decide, and state legislatures have been expressing their views about this. %$* 67
some states have legalized gay marriage. %$* 67
other states have not. %$* 67
but is this one of those things that democracy does not get to decide? %$* 67
is this a thing that the constitution removes from the democratic process and says, "you know what? %$* 67
even if 80 percent of you in utah don't want this, you have to have it anyway"? %$* 67
is this one of those things? %$* 67
does the equal protection clause require that? %$* 67
so those are some of the things you want to keep your eye on as we listen to this debate tonight. %$* 67
there will be a quiz at the end of this for all the law students. %$* 13
let's thank jeffrey rosen and nicholas rosenkranz and bring our debaters to the stage. %$* 13
let's spontaneously explode into applause and bring our debaters onto the stage. %$* 13
same-sex marriage, everybody's got a view on it. %$* 13
more states than ever before are licensing it. %$* 13
but in most cases that was not initially because of a law being passed, enshrining same-sex marriage as a right. %$* 13
most often it was because courts struck down laws that were passed against it. %$* 13
judges are making the call, using the constitution for their guide, which is a different filter on the issue from the ones that most of us use. %$* 13
but what then does the constitution tell us about same-sex marriage? %$* 13
well, it sounds like there must be a debate in that, so let's have it, "yes," or, "no," to this statement, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages," a debate from intelligence squared u.s.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we are in philadelphia, partnering with the national constitution center, for one of our constitutional debate series programs. %$* 13
we have four superbly qualified debaters who will argue for and against this motion, two against two, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience here in philadelphia will vote to choose the winner. %$* 13
and only one side wins. %$* 13
let's meet our debaters. %$* 13
first of all, please welcome john eastman. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john eastman. %$* 13
john, welcome. %$* 13
you are chairman of the board of the national organization for marriage, a professor at chapman university's fowler school of law and founding director of the center for constitutional jurisprudence. %$* 13
you are counsel of record-- %$* 13
that organization is counsel of record in two of the briefs that are filed in the supreme court's same-sex marriage case, and you have an insider's view, personally, of the supreme court because you were a former clerk for justice clarence thomas. %$* 13
any doubt in your mind where he would be on this issue? %$* 13
no more doubt on my mind on his views than on justice ginsburg's views on the case. %$* 154
and justice ginsburg being the left-leaning member of the court. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, thanks, john eastman. %$* 13
and john, your partner is? %$* 13
my partner is sherif girgis, and he's an ivy league-educated expert on the institution of marriage. %$* 154
ladies and gentlemen, sherif girgis. %$* 13
sherif, you are also arguing for the motion that the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriage. %$* 13
you are co-author of the book, "what is marriage? %$* 13
man and woman: a defense." you're currently pursuing both a phd in philosophy from princeton and a law degree from yale. %$* 13
you've got a lot of free time on your hands. %$* 13
you were born in cairo, but didn't stay there very long. %$* 13
isn't that right? %$* 13
right. %$* 155
actually, i grew up mostly in delaware, which, in other parts of the country, is a conversation-stopper. %$* 155
but it's the first state. %$* 13
that's true. %$* 155
yeah. %$* 155
the first ones to sign on to the constitution. %$* 155
we had nothing to lose. %$* 155
ladies and gentlemen, sherif girgis. %$* 13
our motion is “the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriage.” we have two debaters arguing against it. %$* 13
they're against the “not.” let's please welcome first evan wolfson. %$* 13
evan wolfson, you are founder and president of freedom to marry. %$* 13
you are author of the book "why marriage matters." you are widely thought of as the architect of the national marriage equality movement. %$* 13
and we read recently that your greatest hope is that the supreme court's upcoming same-sex marriage ruling will put you out of a job. %$* 13
does that mean early retirement for you? %$* 13
well, i do hope that the supreme court will allow freedom to marry to close its doors, having achieved its mission. %$* 156
but neither my temperament nor my finances will really allow for retirement. %$* 156
so, hopefully there-- %$* 156
and fortunately, there are many other good causes to plunge into. %$* 156
all right. %$* 13
well, we're glad to have you on our stage, and we want to know-- %$* 13
thank you. %$* 156
who is your partner? %$* 13
my partner is my good friend kenji yoshino. %$* 156
ladies and gentlemen, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
kenji, you're a professor at new york university school of law. %$* 13
you're the author of a lot of books, including the just-released "speak now: marriage equality on trial." that tells the story of the hollingsworth v. %$* 13
perry case out in california that overturned proposition 8, california's ban on same-sex marriage. %$* 13
considering what's coming up on the supreme court's docket this season, the timing for that book could not be better. %$* 13
was that the plan all along? %$* 13
i wish i could claim such prescience, john, but it was totally happenstance. %$* 157
and i can say that the two people in the country who could match the same-sex couples who wanted to get married and wanted the supreme court to take the case, in terms of their euphoria when the supreme court finally did take the case, were my editor and my publisher. %$* 157
publishing is happy. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kenji yoshino and the team arguing against the motion the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriage. %$* 13
now, this is a debate. %$* 13
one team will win and one team will lose. %$* 13
and that decision will be made by our live audience here in philadelphia. %$* 13
by the time the debate has ended, you will have voted twice, once before hearing the arguments and then again after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms, between those two votes, will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so, let's register your first vote. %$* 13
take a look at those keypads at your seat. %$* 13
there are 10 digits on them. %$* 13
you only need to pay attention to 1, 2, and 3. %$* 13
take a look at the motion. %$* 13
look at it carefully. %$* 13
the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages. %$* 13
if you agree with this motion, push number 1.and if you disagree, push number 2.and if you are undecided, which is a perfectly reasonable starting position, push number 3.you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
they're not live. %$* 13
and if you push the wrong key by mistake, just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and pay attention to this-- %$* 13
to the word "not" in the motion today. %$* 13
don't get caught by that. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
looks like everybody's registered. %$* 13
let's move on to round one. %$* 13
round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
our motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." here to speak first for this motion, sherif girgis, co-author of the book, "what is marriage? %$* 13
man and woman: a defense."ladies and gentlemen, sherif girgis. %$* 13
well, thank you. %$* 155
and first i want to say it's a huge honor to be speaking opposite these really distinguished guests. %$* 155
i mean, evan wolfson, as they said, is the architect of the movement for same-sex marriage. %$* 155
he's a remarkable visionary and leader whatever you think of the substance of the issue. %$* 155
and kenji yoshino it rightly regarded, including by lots of my conservative friends, as one of the best teachers in the legal academy and certainly one of the best writers. %$* 155
i think you'll see all of that on display tonight. %$* 155
and it would worry me, except that i think that you can be fully onboard with their view of same-sex marriage as a policy matter and still agree with us that it's one of those very important policies where the constitution's just silent. %$* 155
it leaves you free to pick. %$* 155
and the reason, in a nutshell-- %$* 155
and i'm going to be focusing on big picture in this part-- %$* 155
is that the equal protection clause is not enough. %$* 155
it says don't be arbitrary. %$* 155
so have a reasonable vision of what marriage is and of its public purposes and apply it equally, not arbitrarily. %$* 155
it doesn't tell you what vision of marriage to adopt. %$* 155
but that's what this whole debate is exactly about. %$* 155
do we adopt the consent-based view of marriage that says it's fundamentally about deep romantic love and commitment and that the reasons to recognize it are stability and dignity, in which case, yes, recognizing that equally requires recognizing same-sex relationships. %$* 155
or do we have a different vision of marriage? %$* 155
the more traditional vision in our law, the conjugal view of marriage that says marriage is fundamentally about that union in which a man and a woman are coming together and oriented to family life by the very nature of the bond, the act that makes marital love is the kind of act that makes new life. %$* 155
the only relationship that can give kids a shot at being reared by their own mother and father. %$* 155
the problems for the other side in this particular debate are that the constitution doesn't tell you which of those views to adopt, and there's nothing inherently wrong with the conjugal view. %$* 155
and they're going to say that's not true. %$* 155
that last part's not right. %$* 155
the only way you could make your way to the conjugal view is if you were motivated by animus. %$* 155
i think this is one of the easiest parts of the argument to solve, and i'd be interested to see if they have a response to it. %$* 155
history disproves this. %$* 155
this isn't the only way you can get to this view. %$* 155
in fact, there have been cultures that span the spectrum of attitudes towards homosexuality and still have the conjugal view of marriage in their law, cultures that we're perfectly aware of and celebrated long-term same-sex relationships-- %$* 155
in ancient greece in various forms, for example-- %$* 155
but still thought it had nothing to do with marriage; cultures that were totally ignorant of our concept of gay identity. %$* 155
they didn't even know of the class in the way that we do today, to have animus against it. %$* 155
couldn't have been motivated by animus. %$* 155
they might say, well, maybe the view itself isn't motivated by animus, but the idea that same-sex marriage has anything to do with linking kids to their own mom and dad does. %$* 155
it's unreasonable. %$* 155
there's no link. %$* 155
and the problem with that view is that even some prominent same-sex marriage supporters reject it or reject something very close it. %$* 155
so, for example, e.j.graff says, of course, ideas have consequences. %$* 155
changing our idea of marriage is going to have consequences for marriage, practice. %$* 155
and he says, in particular, it will be breathtakingly subversive to recognize gay marriage. %$* 155
it will introduce a revolt against the institution to its very heart, forever cutting the link between it and diapers. %$* 155
andrew sullivan says, of course, it's going to liberate us from not just complementarity but lots of other patriarchal or oppressive norms that restrict the personality, like sexual exclusivity, norms that were tailor-made for opposite-sex relationships. %$* 155
masha gessen, a same-sex marriage advocate said it's a no-brainer that the institution of marriage shouldn't exist and that this is a stepping stone to its deinstitutionalization. %$* 155
they all agree that sexual complementarity, the idea of a man and woman coming together as mother and father to their kids and marriage law historically are all linked together. %$* 155
they just disagree on whether it's good or bad to delink them. %$* 155
so whatever you think of that view, you might reject it. %$* 155
but it can't be motivated by irrationality. %$* 155
and maybe someone will say, well okay, so the case law makes it clear that we can't have this vision of marriage. %$* 155
professor yoshino sometimes points to turner that says, look, you don't lose your marriage rights when you enter a prison because after all you can have things like emotional commitment. %$* 155
and professor yoshino will say, well, there we go. %$* 155
that's the revision, the consent-based view being enshrined in our case law. %$* 155
but just two lines down it talks about the expectation of ex-- %$* 155
- of consummation. %$* 155
it talks about the legitimation of children born into the union. %$* 155
it's clearly taking for granted the conjugal view that had always been the law and just saying, apply that equally. %$* 155
that's the pattern for all the cases that he has brought up in his own writings. %$* 155
the last thing might be this: well, it just imposes a separate status, a disadvantage and so a stigma that's justice kennedy's words about doma.maybe that's the problem, just excluding same-sex relationships is all. %$* 155
that's directly a violation of equality. %$* 155
you don't have to go to all this stuff about picking views and which one's based on what reasons. %$* 155
and the only problem with that view is that if it works against this vision of marriage, it works against all of them. %$* 155
every marriage law creates a separate status. %$* 155
the whole question is where to draw the lines and do we have a reason for drawing them where we do? %$* 155
does it make sense? %$* 155
does it serve any public interest? %$* 155
nothing our opponents tonight will say-- %$* 155
can say will undermine the idea that there may be-- %$* 155
that it's reasonable at least-- %$* 155
whether you agree with it or not, to think that it's worth preferring biological parenting wherever possible, giving kids their best shot at it by using our marriage law unobtrusively to do that and leaving other adults to live and love the lives of their choice. %$* 155
thank you. %$* 155
thank you, sherif girgis. %$* 13
our motion is "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." and here to present his argument against this motion, evan wolfson. %$* 13
he is founder and president of freedom to marry. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, evan wolfson. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 156
thank you, john. %$* 156
my friend, professor yoshino will address the arguments put forward by the opposition in support of continuing discrimination in marriage. %$* 156
in my time, i will focus on the constitution's command of equality and the importance of the freedom to marry to same-sex couples, and thus why you should vote against the motion. %$* 156
i think it's important to begin by noting, we're not talking here about same-sex marriage, some other new thing. %$* 156
what we're talking about is the freedom to marry. %$* 156
the freedom to marry is the fundamental right affirmed by the supreme court at least 14 times. %$* 156
in the united states, rights belong to individuals, not categories. %$* 156
a super majority of americans now support the freedom to marry for gay couples. %$* 156
several polls showing over 60 percent with majority support in every region of the country and across virtually every demographic. %$* 156
now, even if there were not majority support, the courts should uphold the constitution. %$* 156
but the shift in public opinion tells us something. %$* 156
it tells us about the growing understanding as to how and why the constitution does apply to gay people's lives and dreams and to our claim under the constitution. %$* 156
as americans have gotten to understand the real consequences of exclusion from that right of marriage, and as americans have gotten to see real families not just theoretical categories and stereotypes and prejudices. %$* 156
they've come to understand how the constitution's command applies equally to loving and committed couples of the same-sex. %$* 156
the courts, too, like the american people, have shed what justice blackman in his dissent in the infamous 1986 case, bowers v. %$* 156
hardwick called "willful blindness." and in the past two years, 65 courts-- %$* 156
state and federal, appellate and trial level, republican appointees and democratic appointees,-- %$* 156
have ruled now in favor of freedom to marry with only the smallest handful coming out the other way, one of which is now on appeal to the united states supreme court. %$* 156
and in all those 65 cases, my favorite passage comes from the case in which we brought the freedom to marry to utah. %$* 156
the judge in that case says, "it is not the constitution that has changed, but the knowledge of what it means to be gay or lesbian." only those who are willfully blind to the common humanity of gay people today can deny what is clear under the constitution. %$* 156
the supreme court, for example, has long recognized, "the freedom to marry is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” loving v. %$* 156
virginia. %$* 156
the court, in another marriage case went on to say, "the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals." gay people share the same mix of reasons for wanting and needing the freedom to marry and for wanting and needing respect for their lawful marriages as non-gay americans do. %$* 156
and the supreme court has spelled out what these attributes, what these aspects, what these interests in marriage are. %$* 156
my opponent just referred to the case, the case of turner v. %$* 156
safley, the case asking the question whether prisoners could be arbitrarily denied the freedom to marry. %$* 156
and in that case, the supreme court enumerated four important attributes of marriage. %$* 156
"marriage," the court said, "under our constitution, in our time," not ancient egypt, rome, and greece, under our constitution and our time, "the important attributes of marriage," the court said, "are: number one, the opportunity to make a commitment to another person and to make a statement publicly about that commitment and have that commitment reinforced and ratified by the community in the law; number two, the spiritual and religious and personal meanings that marriage brings to many; number three, the prospect," the court said, of what the court called "physical consummation," which we usually call something else, particularly on a saturday night; "and, number four, the tangible and intangible protections and responsibilities that marriage brings under our system of law."gay people share an equal and vital interest in every single one of these important attributes. %$* 156
the freedom to marry is important. %$* 156
and, therefore, to be denied it is to not be treated equally, which, under the command of our constitution, is a guarantee each and every american has. %$* 156
under the equal protection clause a classification, particularly one that disadvantages a historically disfavored group of americans, or a classification that implicates fundamental liberties, fundamental freedoms, or individual dignity, under the equal protection clause, the government must have a sufficient and legitimate reason for drawing that line because the constitution guarantees that all americans subjected to a classification must be treated alike. %$* 156
in this case, because of the importance of what is being denied and because it is being denied to a group of americans who are historically disadvantaged, who have been oppressed, who have been discriminated against, not only in private life but by the government itself, there's all the more reason for the courts to apply what court after court have now done, a meaningful review. %$* 156
and under that meaningful review, there is no justification for continuing this discrimination. %$* 156
and you should vote, "no." %$* 156
thank you, evan wolfson. %$* 13
and a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two against two, fighting it out over this motion, "the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages." you have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. %$* 13
i'd like to welcome to the lectern john eastman. %$* 13
he is the henry salvatori professor of law and community service at chapman university fowler school of law, where he also served as dean. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, john eastman. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 154
i, too, am delighted to be here and to participate in this debate with such esteemed colleagues. %$* 154
in the brief that evan wolfson filed in the supreme court in the marriage case that's currently being heard there, he repeated over and over again, "the real definition of equal protection is-- %$* 154
comes to us from supreme court precedent. %$* 154
it's not a requirement that everybody be treated equally no matter what the circumstances, it's that all persons who are similarly situated shall be treated alike." and he repeats this over and over again. %$* 154
on page seven on the brief the operative presumption is that the legislature has presumably permissively determined that the persons affected by a classification are not similarly situated in the first place. %$* 154
the real question for us is whether the equal protection clause require us to understand or to adopt one version of marriage by which everybody agrees people are similarly situated. %$* 154
if the institution of marriage is simply about the loving relationships between adults and the dignity that the state might confer on that relationship, then there's no reason to distinguish one set of relationships from another. %$* 154
but if marriage is about something different than that, if it's about that unique biological complementarity of men and women structured in a institution that gives life to the offspring of that relationship, then it's quite obvious that same-sex and opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated. %$* 154
and it doesn't violate equal protection not to treat groups who are not similarly situated differently. %$* 154
that's the real question for us, what is the very purpose of marriage therefore? %$* 154
is it for the state to confer a dignity, to recognize this adult relationship, as evan has claimed? %$* 154
or is it something else, something much more profound? %$* 154
why is it that every society in human history, across cultures and ages, have adopted something very similar to the man/woman understanding of marriage that we're talking about today? %$* 154
it's because there's something inherent in the nature of men and women, and that function that they alone can provide that is essential to the marital relationship and to the creation of the next generation. %$* 154
when the supreme court 14 times in its cases has talked about marriage as a fundamental right, it has always been in the context of that basic understanding. %$* 154
in loving v. %$* 154
virginia, it went on in the sentence after the one evan quoted to say because it's necessary-- %$* 154
it's essential to our very existence and survival. %$* 154
that's not true if you remove from that purpose of the institution this unique procreative ability of men and women. %$* 154
so, what is the purpose of marriage? %$* 154
what is the state's interest or reason for getting involved in the institution of marriage at all? %$* 154
there are all sorts of relationships that the state doesn't have anything to say about: friendships, brother-sister relationships, mother-father, cousins, all sorts of relationships. %$* 154
the state has no interest in getting it-- %$* 154
even if they're very loving relationships, even if they're romantically loving relationships. %$* 154
that's not why the state got in the marriage business in the first place, and why it is the third party in every marriage contract. %$* 154
it's this unique procreative ability of men and women. %$* 154
and the third is, if we're going to radically redefine that purpose to be about adults rather than that child-centered focus, who decides that question? %$* 154
well, in our society, in almost every case, the constitution does not settle those questions. %$* 154
it leaves it up to the people to decide. %$* 154
and that's the real question we have here. %$* 154
has this constitutional provision adopted in 1868 already decided this question for us, and said, "you know, you people, you don't get to decide this question." we're not talking about discriminating against a group of people. %$* 154
that the constitution has decided. %$* 154
we're talking about redefining a core societal institution to be a dramatically different purpose than it has ever had before. %$* 154
that question the constitution doesn't decide. %$* 154
and it's that question that we have to answer on the get-go. %$* 154
so, we've got a lot of history here to try and figure out what exactly this purpose of marriage is. %$* 154
you go all the way back to california cases-- %$* 154
i'm from california, so i'll start with some there-- %$* 154
100 years ago, we had this clear. %$* 154
the first purpose of matrimony, by the laws of nature and society, is procreation. %$* 154
and then 100 years later it shows it hasn't changed. %$* 154
the sexual procreative and child-rearing aspects of marriage go to the very essence of the marital relation. %$* 154
justice kennedy, in his opening of his opinion in the windsor case, striking down the defense of marriage act just two years ago, he says this at the very beginning: "for marriage between a man and a woman, no doubt it's been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term. %$* 154
and to its role and function throughout the history of civilization." those are the questions-- %$* 154
those-- %$* 154
that's what we understand marriage to be. %$* 154
and it takes a radical redefinition of it, a change in its core purpose, to create-- %$* 154
to create an equality of claim here. %$* 154
and it's that change in purpose that raises a lot of concerns and raises the state interest about not changing this. %$* 154
so, what happens if we just change the institution of marriage? %$* 154
well, we've got an experiment with this. %$* 154
50 years ago, we changed another core aspect of marriage-- %$* 154
the norm of its permanence. %$* 154
we did it by adopting no-fault divorce laws. %$* 154
we said, you know, if things hit a bump in the road, you can get out of your marriage a lot easier than you could. %$* 154
everybody said at the time "it won't affect the institution of marriage. %$* 154
it won't alter your marriage." but what we've seen over those 50 years is a dramatic reduction in the societal norms the-- %$* 154
the incentive that the institutional understanding, the definitional understanding provided. %$* 154
people no longer-- %$* 154
in many instances-- %$* 154
think that marriage is a life-long commitment. %$* 154
"it's a life-long commitment unless i hit bumps on the road, ceases to be in the way of my adult fulfillment, and then i get out of it." that little shift changed it from a child- centered institution to an adult-centered institution. %$* 154
and it has had dramatic consequences. %$* 154
well, we're now talking about a shift that's even more profound, to remove the gender complementarity, the gender diversity in the raising of children-- %$* 154
all of those things-- %$* 154
to make this more about the adult relationship than the child who are the offspring of that man-woman union-- %$* 154
is going to dramatically reduce the incentives that that institution provides as a cultural norms-- %$* 154
cultural-- %$* 154
sorry. %$* 154
i ran out of time. %$* 154
i wasn’t watching. %$* 154
very much. %$* 154
john eastman. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
sorry. %$* 154
your time is up. %$* 13

i wasn’t watching. %$* 154
thank you very much. %$* 13
very much. %$* 154
thank you, john eastman. %$* 13
our motion is the equal protection clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages. %$* 13
and here to argue against this motion, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
he is the chief justice earl warren professor of constitutional law at the new york university school of law. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, kenji yoshino. %$* 13
so i, too, am so honored to be here with esteemed colleagues to debate this crucial issue. %$* 157
and i want to begin with the language of the equal protection clause, which says, "no state shall  %$* 157
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." when this language was ratified in 1868, we were coming off of a civil war. %$* 157
and the framers of that amendment could easily have limited the equality in question to the context of race. %$* 157
in fact, if we look at the adjacent, roughly contemporaneous 13th and 15th amendments, the three together known as the reconstruction amendments, we see that there are limitations to race, to color, to the previous condition of servitude. %$* 157
so why is it that the framers did not cabin the notion of equality to race, but instead adverted to a higher level of generality and said, this means equality for all individuals. %$* 157
i would offer to you that they jumped up to that level of abstraction because they wanted to leave it to intelligence of successive generations to determine what equality meant for them. %$* 157
indeed, if the equal protection clause had not been framed in these majestic and soaring abstract terms, gender equality would not have been able to be a heightened scrutiny classification, by which i mean a classification that draws the particular solicitude of the court, moving us from the presumption that a law is constitutional to moving us to the presumption that it's unconstitutional when heightened scrutiny is applied. %$* 157
gender discrimination would not be a protected classification under the equal protection clause if we adhere to the understanding of equality that obtained in 1868. %$* 157
so the question for my opponents is, do they believe that the meaning of the equal protection clause, even though it was textually framed at that level of generality, does not protect women as a heightened scrutiny classification. %$* 157
and if it protects women, then why would it not protect sexual orientation? %$* 157
i would also offer to you that we can think about this, as mr. %$* 157
rosenkranz said at the beginning of this debate, either as a sex discrimination issue or as a sexual orientation discrimination issue. %$* 157
if we think about it as a sex discrimination issue, they will already make bars on same-sex marriage presumptively unconstitutional. %$* 157
if we think about it as a sexual orientation discrimination issue, this is a harder lift, because the supreme court has not yet taught us or told us whether or not heightened scrutiny will be applied in a formal way to the classifications based on sexual orientation. %$* 157
so i want to make the steepest climb. %$* 157
i want to both assume that the most deferential level of review will be applied by the court under the equal protection clause. %$* 157
and i want to assume the definition of marriage that was forwarded by my opponents and to say that the equal protection clause requires, right, gays to be included within the institution of marriage even if we understand that marriage has at least a procreative dimension. %$* 157
the first thing i want to point out here, going to professor eastman's comments about the propagation of the species, is that gay individuals are not infertile. %$* 157
gay individuals procreate. %$* 157
and in fact, my husband and i have two children, and those two children are among the hundreds of thousands of children in this country alone who are being raised by same-sex couples. %$* 157
so the argument has to be that we're doing a worse job at raising them-- %$* 157
and this would be mr. %$* 157
girgis' point-- %$* 157
than heterosexual couples are doing with their children. %$* 157
and i would only say that this is not a theoretical question. %$* 157
it's an empirical question. %$* 157
and every major professional organization that touches the interests of children-- %$* 157
including the american academy of pediatrics, the american medical association, the american psychiatric association, the american psychological association, the national association of social workers-- %$* 157
all of these professional organizations have said that gay parents are doing just as well as straight parents in raising their children. %$* 157
the kids are all right. %$* 157
with regard to the second rationale that might be offered, is the notion that professor eastman alluded to which is the deinstitutionalization of heterosexual marriage. %$* 157
and the idea here is that if gay people are permitted to get married, then heterosexual couples will lose esteem for the institution and engage in procreative activity outside of the institution. %$* 157
now, this is counterintuitive at best, you know, as was articulated by one of the witnesses in the prop 8 trial. %$* 157
i don't think many of you heterosexual people are going to go home and say, you know, we've had a good run, but now that ted and steve down the street can get married, we have to throw in the towel, and we're not going to get married anymore. %$* 157
so i think more needs to be said empirically about the deinstitutionalization argument. %$* 157
i want to close with the words of justice ruth bader ginsburg in a canonical 1996 equal protection case, because we are talking about equality. %$* 157
she said the history of our constitution is a story in which constitutional rights and protections were extended to groups that were previously ignored or excluded. %$* 157
to include those groups, ladies and gentlemen, i ask you to oppose this motion. %$* 157
thank you. %$* 157

about slavery-- %$* 346
you think slavery is a good thing? %$* 346
slavery in america is a good thing? %$* 346
that was a centrist position in 1850 during the famous 1850 compromise. %$* 346
that center changed. %$* 346
and it should. %$* 346
we had abraham lincoln. %$* 346
he came around and guess what? %$* 346
he was a republican-- %$* 346
you must resist-- %$* 346
thank you. %$* 346
thanks, laura ingraham. %$* 13
you must resist-- %$* 346
thank you. %$* 346
laura, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you, laura ingraham. %$* 13
that concludes round 1 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is "the gop must seize the center or die." keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
we're going to have you vote again at the end of the debate, and the team who's moved your views most in percentage terms will be declared our winner. %$* 13
now we move on to round 2, and that is where the debaters address each other directly, and they answer questions from me and from you in our audience. %$* 13
we have two teams of two arguing this motion, "the gop must seize the center or die." we have david brooks and mickey edwards in support of the motion. %$* 13
we've heard them say that the republican party has become too hostile to government, that it is losing ethnic minorities and young people, and that those are two growing groups. %$* 13
they say that resistance to compromise is not a winning message and that the party has found itself at odds with the more diverse population. %$* 13
the side arguing against the motion, "the gop must seize the center or die, ralph reed and laura ingraham. %$* 13
they've argued that the sky is not at all falling for the gop, that the gop is doing very, very well in the states and in local governments, that it has had these losing streaks before and has bounced back, and that never has a move to the mushy middle, as they called it, turned out to be a winning strategy, and if they tried and compromised their core convictions, they would alienate a base that is too large to be alienated. %$* 13
they would lose. %$* 13
i want to put a question-- %$* 13
i see that we're already debating this whole notion of what are we talking about when we say there is a center. %$* 13
and i want to put to the side arguing against the motion-- %$* 13
against the notion of compromise on this. %$* 13
you have said that the center is really a moving target; it can change by the month or by the year. %$* 13
one of your opponents, mickey edwards, put it a different way. %$* 13
he talked about the center as an approach to your opponents, an approach to the process, that it's a willingness to compromise, and that ultimately being willing to go to the center is a willingness to go to the common ground, and when you get there, that's where the center is. %$* 13
i'd like you to take that on and elaborate more on this debate about what we mean by "the center." laura ingraham. %$* 13
yeah, well, i-- %$* 346
again, i think that the center is a moving target. %$* 346
when you say "seize the center," which is the proposition of the debate, what does that mean? %$* 346
i'm looking at the hole that-- %$* 346
but allow me to interrupt you because you just made that point. %$* 13
and my question to you-- %$* 13
request to you is to respond to his point that it's a style of government and a willingness to compromise. %$* 13
well, a compromise over what? %$* 346
if you compromise over the core principles of your party, then you are ultimately representing nothing, and you might as well just be a shimmer or a figurehead, representing nothing. %$* 346
so compromise on, "well, we're going to spend x amount of money versus y amount of money," oh, that's compromise, i understand what you're saying. %$* 346
but when you say "seizing the center," that stands for a set of principles. %$* 346
in the liberal lexicon, seizing the center for barack obama never meant, "okay, i'm going to actually now look at the way we spend our military money or the way we run our foreign policy differently."he doesn't believe that's seizing the center. %$* 346
compromise only exists when it sets about to erode conservative principles. %$* 346
so you're saying there are situations where there cannot be compromise, where-- %$* 13
well, yes. %$* 346
yes, i am. %$* 346
okay. %$* 13
all right, i want to take that point back to the other side, david brooks or mickey edwards, either side-- %$* 13
either-- %$* 13
first brooks. %$* 13
well, i guess the first thing i've noticed about this debate so far is our esteemed opponents are mostly talking tactics and we're mostly talking substance. %$* 344
no, actually not. %$* 346
so they've talked about how to win elections. %$* 344
mickey and i have talked about how to solve problems. %$* 344
mickey talked about the problems of political dysfunction in washington, and that's to start with a position and then behave in a prudential manner to try to ease political dysfunction in politics, and that's a centrist position, which involves the practice of patriotic service to the country, understanding there are two sides and both sides contain some truth. %$* 344
i talked about social segmentation, a problem that charles murray has talked about, a problem that i think can be addressed with limited but energetic government. %$* 344
we've talked about how to solve those two problems, so neither of us has talked about moving to the center-- %$* 344
but the response i heard-- %$* 13
the response i heard from laura was that her opposition to compromise is that in certain situations for a party to compromise makes the party not stand for itself, and i see the logic of that. %$* 13
i'd like you to respond to that point. %$* 13
mickey edwards. %$* 13
you know, it's not about the party standing for itself. %$* 345
it's about the party standing for the country. %$* 345
you know-- %$* 345
james madison is my hero. %$* 345
i love madison, the champion of limited government. %$* 345
but he was also for government. %$* 345
the constitution was not just to put constraints on government but to empower government to act in a reasonable, rational way as a nation. %$* 345
this is not a collection of disparate ideas. %$* 345
this is a full-fledged nation of people who must come together if they're going to do anything worthwhile. %$* 345
government doesn't have all the power. %$* 345
government doesn't have all the responsibility, but government does have some responsibility. %$* 345
and that's where the republican party is copping out. %$* 345
ralph reed. %$* 13
well, i would say, first of all, to david's point, david, what we've been debating is the resolution. %$* 347
and what the resolution says is that the republican party must move to the center or die. %$* 347
now, i haven't heard the other side define these terms. %$* 347
i offered my definition. %$* 347
i'll give you a further definition from merriam’s, which is “the center is the middle point that is equidistant to both end points on a sphere,” okay? %$* 347
that's what the center is. %$* 347
so we're not going to let you off the hook by saying, you can be a conservative, but you've got to compromise. %$* 347
the resolution makes it very clear that the point to which you must compromise is the point that is equidistant between democrats and republicans. %$* 347
the resolution further says that if the republican party doesn't do that, that it will die. %$* 347
now, ask yourself, if you're governor scott walker in wisconsin, and you want to reform the pension program for public employees, because if you don't, it's going to bankrupt your stay. %$* 347
and then that young lady that david's so concerned about isn't going to be able to get any social services because the state's going to be bankrupt. %$* 347
and he offers a proposal that the public unions opposed. %$* 347
and then it goes to a vote. %$* 347
where is the compromise? %$* 347
they tried to recall him. %$* 347
you want to know what? %$* 347
he won the recall election by a bigger margin than he won the original election because he stood on principle, and he didn't compromise away his principles. %$* 347
all right, laura ingraham. %$* 13
i want to add to that. %$* 346
i mean, the argument that mickey and david are making-- %$* 346
and that i would say it's not a substantive argument. %$* 346
i would say american greatness conservatism, which was at the crux of much of what david brooks argued for during the bush years, supporting a larger, more energetic federal government, supporting not only the war in iraq, but the war in afghanistan. %$* 346
it was an utter failure. %$* 346
it grew the deficit. %$* 346
it ended up losing the republicans, their hard- fought gains in the senate and the house of representatives. %$* 346
and by the end of this moving to the center of the bush administration, the republicans had lost the house, the senate and turned the white house over to the most liberal president ever to step foot in 1600 pennsylvania avenue. %$* 346
so the republican party moved to the center, david brooks-- %$* 346
i like you very much-- %$* 346
and it got clobbered. %$* 346
and only when it moved away from the-- %$* 346
all right. %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
center did it win in 2010. %$* 346
let me think about the-- %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
the centrist republican party we've seen over the last ten years. %$* 344
the centrism of tom delay, the centrism of newt gingrich. %$* 344
george bush. %$* 346
the centrism of mitt romney. %$* 344
we talked about makers versus takers who had a deportationist immigration policy. %$* 344
we have not seen a centrist republican party. %$* 344
was bush centrist? %$* 346
no. %$* 344
he was-- %$* 344
he wasn't? %$* 346
no. %$* 344
okay. %$* 346
well, i haven't seen that column written by you. %$* 346
i don't write about bush so much anymore. %$* 344
last time i checked, you were defending the surge in 2008 when the country, the center was against the surge. %$* 346
you wrote a column, june 24, 2008, defending the surge as the right thing to do against the center of the country that was against the war in iraq. %$* 346
you wrote that column, i didn't. %$* 346
wait, did-- %$* 344
i support the surge, and i supported the surge. %$* 344
the surge is not exactly the crucial issue in 21st century american policy. %$* 344
iraq is pretty important to me. %$* 346
we would have lost the war without it. %$* 18
barack obama wouldn't be president if the war in iraq hadn't been fought. %$* 346
hillary clinton would be president of the united states right now. %$* 346
all right, all right. %$* 13
you know, we've done a bunch of debates on the war in iraq and-- %$* 13
well, we're talking about the center. %$* 346
and they were good, and they're available as a podcast. %$* 13
at iq2 u.s. %$* 13
let me put something else into the conversation here. %$* 13
and it was the argument made by the side arguing for motion, that the party as it now stands is losing touch with-- %$* 13
has lost touch with growing segments of the population, that part of the population being the young, maybe some segment of women and ethnic minorities. %$* 13
and i just want you to take that on. %$* 13
and ralph reed, i acknowledge your point, and i want to take it to the other side ultimately, that you're also talking about the basis, it cannot be alienated. %$* 13
but right now, take on their point, because again, i see the logic to that, and it's hanging out there, so i'd like you to respond to it. %$* 13
yeah, i mean, here, again, those who counsel moderation, trimming your sails, moving to the, quote, "middle," never succeed in winning minority votes. %$* 347
the candidates who do well among minority voters-- %$* 347
and, mickey, i know when you were one of the most conservative members of the house, serving in the '80s, you regularly won large percentage of the african-american vote in your district. %$* 347
conservatism is not anathema to minority voters. %$* 347
and in fact the high water mark in the post-world war ii period for a republican presidential candidate in winning hispanic votes was george w.bush in 2004.and if you look at that, he won 44 percent of the hispanic vote. %$* 347
you look at the hispanics he did well among, he over-performed among self-identified conservatives. %$* 347
40 percent of hispanics self-identify as conservatives, 22 percent are evangelical, another 25 percent are faithful catholics, 2 million of them are small business owners. %$* 347
and that's how you win their votes. %$* 347
bush won 75 percent of evangelical hispanics. %$* 347
they're pro-life, they're pro-marriage, they're for lower taxes. %$* 347
these are conservatives. %$* 347
so you don't-- %$* 347
it's not an either/or. %$* 347
you know, mike huckabee who is a pro-life, pro-marriage conservative, won 60 percent of the african-american vote in arkansas. %$* 347
let me stop you there and take it to this side because i see your point. %$* 13
they really punched some holes in your argument that the party is-- %$* 13
you know, your comment about if it were for old white men, that would be terrific. %$* 13
but they're actually saying that there is not a natural alienation between the current conservative views of the party and minorities, women and young people. %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
there's a lot of chum being thrown in the air, a lot of tracers flying up. %$* 344
the idea we should be debating the surge, that's a little bizarre. %$* 344
the center-- %$* 346
the center of the country was wrong. %$* 346
the idea that republicans did well among hispanics, it's bizarre. %$* 344
they did not do well among hispanics. %$* 344
i said when george w. bush ran, and you said he was a conservative. %$* 347
well, he had a much better immigration policy than the current republican party does, i'll grant you that. %$* 344
and he had an immigration policy which involved comprehensive immigration reform. %$* 344
so that's the kind of centrism i can support. %$* 344
it's an immigration reform that includes something for democrats, something for republicans and most of all a lot for the country. %$* 344
it's the sort of immigration reform-- %$* 344
but you just said that george w. bush wasn't a centrist. %$* 347
ralph-- %$* 344
ralph, come on. %$* 344
let me finish. %$* 344
okay. %$* 347
it's the kind of immigration reform that includes getting new skilled workers into this country. %$* 344
it's the kind of immigration reform that involves increasing economic growth, welcoming the sort of people into this country who pay taxes over their lifetime and create the country. %$* 344
it's the kind of immigration reform that george bush supported, that’s centrist-- %$* 344
okay. %$* 347
if you want to call that-- %$* 344
let me finish that. %$* 344
it’s centrist republican supported, it's the kind of immigration reform that is now in mortal peril because of a republican party that has gone to the red rump. %$* 344
and if they defeat this immigration reform in this election-- %$* 344
all right. %$* 13
they might as well write a suicide note. %$* 344
david, i need you to park the car and let laura ingraham-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 346
let me-- %$* 346
laura ingraham respond, then i'll come back to you. %$* 13
i happen to have a latina daughter, okay? %$* 346
she's almost eight years old. %$* 346
and i take this issue very seriously. %$* 346
and i take the issue of immigration seriously. %$* 346
i believe in it. %$* 346
i believe it adds enormously to the fabric of our society. %$* 346
but the resolution on the table is the republican party must move to the center or die. %$* 346
and we are arguing about george w.bush only because george w.bush is the most recent national example of a republican that all the individuals under the age of 35 remember. %$* 346
if you're under 35, the only national republican you really have any experience with is george w.bush. %$* 346
and the last time i checked, george w.bush drove up the deficit, got us involved in two wars that ended up being either badly explained or just wildly unpopular because they didn't seem like they were helping americans at home and were not all that successful. %$* 346
and i will say that when he left office, he had-- %$* 346
i believe, the last approval rating he had was about 32 percent. %$* 346
the republican party was decimated between 2005 and 2008.and during those years, there was not a tea party. %$* 346
there was no sarah palin. %$* 346
this was no issue with the tea party influence. %$* 346
it was because we had an abysmally centrist and out of touch george w. bush in the white house that the republican party has still not come to terms with. %$* 346
mickey edwards. %$* 13
and i believe he was in many ways the centrist dream that david brooks loves. %$* 346
mickey edwards. %$* 13
you know, i feel like i'm watching one of those games where you try to see which shell the pea is under. %$* 345
so, i mean, you guys keep talking about the definitional problem, we're not defining the issue right, and yet you keep redefining conservatism. %$* 345
i mean, ralph, i appreciate the fact that you pointed out that when i was running for congress, and when i was there, i routinely carried the african-american vote by good margins. %$* 345
but, you know, a very interesting thing happened. %$* 345
there was a political scientist who did a study of me. %$* 345
i can't imagine why he would do that, but he looked-- %$* 345
and he compared my voting record with what it would be today. %$* 345
and he said, “holding things steady”-- %$* 345
when i was in congress, you're absolutely right. %$* 345
i was one of the most conservative members of congress. %$* 345
and if i were in congress today, voting exactly the same way on exactly the same issues, i would be one of the most liberal republicans in congress. %$* 345
it's the party that has changed. %$* 345
that's not the party of reagan. %$* 345
it's not the party of barry goldwater. %$* 345
you know, it's-- %$* 345
this is a party that has become something different and unrecognizable, something that is at war with the american people, that's at war with people's rights-- %$* 345
i don't think that's true-- %$* 346
to make their own choices. %$* 345
if the republican party is as out of touch as you claim it to be, how do we have a-- %$* 346
how do we have people like nikki haley, susana martinez, ted cruz? %$* 346
we have incredible people across this country-- %$* 346
scott walker and-- %$* 346
marco rubio. %$* 345
marco rubio and all these other people. %$* 346
it's-- %$* 346
where is marco rubio-- %$* 345
the idea that that party-- %$* 346
on immigration? %$* 345
i mean-- %$* 345
what? %$* 346
i agree with you on those points. %$* 345
but those people don't agree with you. %$* 345
excuse me. %$* 346
the party-- %$* 346
what are you talking about? %$* 346
wait a minute. %$* 13
mickey, mickey. %$* 346
no. %$* 346
no. %$* 346
can i-- %$* 13
so-- %$* 13
so, first of all-- %$* 346
i want to know-- %$* 346
let ralph reed come in. %$* 13
ralph. %$* 13
can i-- %$* 347
ralph reed. %$* 13
respond to that? %$* 347
yeah. %$* 13
i helped them during their campaigns, mickey. %$* 347
as did i. %$* 346
i assure you, they agree with me. %$* 347
i don't know about this resolution, but let me say this. %$* 347
i think laura and i-- %$* 347
i'm not sure, but we-- %$* 347
i don't want to get too down the rabbit trail of immigration. %$* 347
but i think that it elucidates the disagreement we're having. %$* 347
they seem to be saying, or at least mickey is, that it's okay to be a conservative, you just have to be willing to compromise. %$* 347
well, as i understand it, that's not really the resolution. %$* 347
it goes without saying that in the legislative process, you have give-or-take. %$* 347
i mean, if you read this comprehensive immigration proposal that was released this morning, it has the toughest enforcement and border security measures in u.s.history. %$* 347
if you entered this country illegally, the soonest you can get a green card is 13 years. %$* 347
the soonest. %$* 347
for many, it'll be 20 years. %$* 347
and nobody-- %$* 347
but nobody under this bill moved ahead of the 4.7 million people who have played by the rules, obeyed the law, and are waiting in line right now. %$* 347
not one. %$* 347
now, that is not amnesty. %$* 347
and i-- %$* 347
even if you don't agree with the bill, i defy anybody to say that what marco rubio has done is seize the center. %$* 347
what he has done is he has-- %$* 347
as a brilliant legislator and he's very gifted-- %$* 347
and this is not just me talking. %$* 347
the president has said he's been a positive influence. %$* 347
chuck schumer called him a “game-changer.” he brought conservative principles to bear, okay? %$* 347
okay. %$* 344
ralph, can you move your chair over here? %$* 344
okay laura-- %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
do you agree with a single word of what ralph just said-- %$* 344
i think ralph just joined our side. %$* 344
no, i didn't-- %$* 347
we're on your side. %$* 344
i will say that that's not actually the proposition either, david. %$* 346
but you're right. %$* 346
i disagree with what ralph said on a number of issues. %$* 346
but that's not the proposition so, cute little tactic. %$* 346
that might work at the gray lady. %$* 346
it doesn't work here. %$* 346
i posit that-- %$* 344
no, no. %$* 346
let me-- %$* 346
i posited that as a-- %$* 344
no, no. %$* 346
let me-- %$* 346
as a-- %$* 344
as a living example-- %$* 344
mr. %$* 346
donvan, let me add something. %$* 346
of the sort of governance-- %$* 344
wait, wait. %$* 13
laura, let's-- %$* 13
mickey and i are talking about. %$* 344
david, now start speaking. %$* 13
say it again. %$* 13
no, he's-- %$* 347
no, no, whoa. %$* 13
whoa-- %$* 13
not for-- %$* 347
he's against the resolution. %$* 347
i’m thinking in terms of a radio broadcast and the engineer's going to be, “who's talking? %$* 13
well-- %$* 346
david, make your point. %$* 13
i'm going to come back to laura. %$* 13
david. %$* 13
well, i just-- %$* 344
i'll just say it again. %$* 344
i posited immigration reform, which marco rubio-- %$* 344
this gang put together as a perfect model, not some abstraction of george bush as a centrist, which i do not remember really, but a concrete thing we can argue about as an example of the sort of governance i think mickey and i agree with. %$* 344
democrats, republicans getting together, a substantive bill that helps the country, that mickey, me, and ralph all support. %$* 344
laura ingraham. %$* 13
laura, do you want to-- %$* 13
no. %$* 13
now, marco-- %$* 346
first of all, marco rubio was the upstart candidate against the establishment, moderate, centrist charlie crist. %$* 346
do not interrupt me, please. %$* 346
charlie crist, who is now a democrat. %$* 346
charlie crist's positions in florida were widely hailed by liberal republicans and liberals, period. %$* 346
he also happened to be unseated by the tea party. %$* 346
i had marco rubio on my radio show in february of 2009.he was 23 points behind. %$* 346
i saw in marco rubio someone different from the republican dinosaur establishment, the same people who had driven the party, from bush on down, into almost oblivion. %$* 346
all the gains we won during gingrich were lost almost under george w.bush. %$* 346
marco rubio is a different type of legislator. %$* 346
it doesn't mean i'm going to agree with him on everything. %$* 346
wait, but-- %$* 13
but i like what he’s trying to do with the national conversation. %$* 346
does he represent the conservative wing that is not moving to the center? %$* 13
i think marco rubio is a doer and i think he's a conservative. %$* 346
it doesn't mean on every issue you agree with him, but that's not the proposition. %$* 346
the proposition is you either move to the center or die. %$* 346
marco rubio was campaigned against by establishment republicans-- %$* 346
but has he moved to the center and not died? %$* 13
i don't think he's-- %$* 346
i think he's-- %$* 346
he had the idea of immigration reform seven years ago. %$* 346
not by any-- %$* 347
no. %$* 347
seven years ago. %$* 346
you cannot say that marco rubio is a moderate by any intellectually defensible analysis - - %$* 347
pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, against %$* 346
of america's political-- %$* 347
i just need one person speaking at a time, and right now it's ralph reed. %$* 13
well, and i would go further and say that, you know-- %$* 347
again, to point out what laura was saying, if you think marco rubio's a moderate, i urge you to go home after tonight's session and read his speech to cpac a couple of weeks ago, where he began his speech by defending the definition of traditional marriage, where he began by defending the sanctity of innocent human life. %$* 347
and, by the way, we have a new nbc news wall street journal pullout i think within the last few days-- %$* 347
last few days. %$* 346
that shows that 53 percent of the american people favor restrictions on abortion or having it banned entirely. %$* 347
the cnn poll within the last two weeks shows it at 52 percent, the gallup poll shows it at 51 percent. %$* 347
my point is if we had had this debate at an earlier time, they would've been saying, "you need to moderate your stance on that issue." we didn’t. %$* 347
we've done fine without moderating it. %$* 347
people are hungering for candidates who are authentic, who have core convictions, who have moral clarity, but, yes, are willing to work across party lines. %$* 347
all right. %$* 13
mickey, you haven't had a word in a bit. %$* 13
do you want to come in or do you want to cede to david? %$* 13
well, i would love to cede to david, but let me just make this one point. %$* 345
i mean, this is-- %$* 345
it's not about marco rubio. %$* 345
what happened with marco rubio was he got elected, and he became a member of the united states senate, and he said, "i've taken an oath of office for the constitution, and my job is to help govern america." it's-- %$* 345
you know, it can't be that everything is a matter of principle. %$* 345
it-- %$* 345
he voted against the gun bill today. %$* 346
is that centrist? %$* 346
cannot be that you never compromise on anything, you know? %$* 345
and that's the reputation the republican party is getting, the party of "no." you don't say, "no," to america. %$* 345
you say, "i've taken an oath of office. %$* 345
i'm a member of government. %$* 345
i have to try to make something happen." and that's what marco rubio has done. %$* 345
i really think-- %$* 344
i-- %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
david brooks. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
let me come back to you guys after this. %$* 13
i mean, i just think you guys aren't listening to us. %$* 344
when we are talking about-- %$* 344
where's dr. %$* 346
phil? %$* 346
in moderation-- %$* 344
we're not talking about being-- %$* 344
they're so right you just don't know it. %$* 13
we need dr. %$* 346
phil here. %$* 346
hear me. %$* 344
david brooks. %$* 13
so-- %$* 344
mickey and i have consistently-- %$* 344
when we talked about moderation, we have not said, "you have to be without principles." we have not said, "you have to be some invisible squish." we say, "you start with your principles. %$* 344
first, you address your real principles to real problems like the economy and immigration. %$* 344
and then you try to work with the people on the other side who contain some piece of the truth." now, what's happened to the republican party is that it shifted, and people who used to be thought of as "conservatives" are now thought of as "moderates." first there was mickey. %$* 344
now there's ralph. %$* 344
you’ve turned ralph-- %$* 344
you, with your immigration position, you've turned ralph into a squish. %$* 344
david, david, nice try. %$* 347
i don't think anybody's buying that i'm a moderate. %$* 347
john, john-- %$* 346
i want to move on to-- %$* 13
i want to move on to-- %$* 13

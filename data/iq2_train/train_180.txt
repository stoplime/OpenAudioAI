my name's trudy levine. %$* 491
what we do have now is genetically engineered food. %$* 491
and this started off with the idea that it was going to enhance food production, it was going to enhance food all over the world. %$* 491
there are many countries that have said, as you're saying, that they didn't know what would happen. %$* 491
and they decided to not do it. %$* 491
we've now seen that it is affecting production of non-genetically engineered food. %$* 491
can you end this question in relation to humans? %$* 13
yeah, and i'm wondering, you know, you seem to be willing to go ahead and say that the risks are worth taking, and if we look at where the risks have taken us so far-- %$* 491
your question to decide arguing against prohibition. %$* 13
problems, so i'd like you to address that. %$* 491
thanks. %$* 13
lee silver. %$* 13
we've been genetically engineering food for 10,000 years. %$* 484
that's the basis for civilization. %$* 484
when it comes to-- %$* 484
no, lee, but genetic-- %$* 13
i mean, the genetic-- %$* 13
the modified food is the actual mixture of species, it's not the same thing as crossing species. %$* 13
well, we've been mixing species, too, actually. %$* 484
cows come from different species, and the-- %$* 484
all right. %$* 13
the llama comes from different species. %$* 484
people understood this-- %$* 484
absolutely right. %$* 13
thousands of years ago. %$* 484
but what i am talking about supporting is the case where there are already people in the world, some people, who have certain genetic variants that provide health advantages, promote health. %$* 484
so we understand how those genes work because we see the empirical evidence. %$* 484
that's what i am suggesting, that we should allow parents to choose for their own children. %$* 484
why can't they give the genes that have already been present in other children and promote health, why can't they give those to their own children? %$* 484
response from the other side, or do you want to pass? %$* 13
genetically modified foods don't go to school or make love, whole range of things they don't do. %$* 482
i've got no problem with genetically modified plants. %$* 482
i think actually it would be an important technology for the world, given the problems with water supply. %$* 482
i think we have to differentiate very substantially from what happens in genetically modified crops from what happens actually in human beings. %$* 482
the actual-- %$* 481
the issue of genetically modified food's an interesting one because it shows you how you can develop a technology, patent it, and then control it through monopoly control like some of the companies do, so that farmers can't-- %$* 481
farmers cannot even own the seeds or replant the seeds. %$* 481
i mean, we've seen a system of capitalistic control over seeds that we've never seen before in history. %$* 481
i don't think this is very desirable for a diverse agricultural system, but we're waiting to see what happens in the future. %$* 481
no parent of any child will ever control that child. %$* 481
take it from me. %$* 481
and speaking of children, young man. %$* 13
i hope you won't think it condescending for me to ask you what grade you're in? %$* 13
seventh grade. %$* 492
all right, good for you for being here. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 492
this question is directed towards mr. %$* 492
silver. %$* 492
and you just touched on the topic of safety when-- %$* 492
oh, what's your name, by the way? %$* 13
philip schneider %$* 492
okay. %$* 13
and i was wondering to what extent does safety mean for this thing to go into effect? %$* 492
safety's very important. %$* 484
but what does "safety" mean? %$* 492
what does "safety" mean? %$* 484
yeah. %$* 492
safety is relative, and i think that's the most important point. %$* 484
and reproduction is dangerous. %$* 484
if a technology can come along that can make reproduction less dangerous, that's a technology we should embrace. %$* 484
you know, we have-- %$* 481
sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
a system of safety on drug safety, for example, in the united states, and you wouldn't expect people to just be taking drugs that have not gone through clinical trials and a government regulatory agency. %$* 481
and you cannot just go to a company and say, "i'll be part of your clinical trial," unless there's been some approval for that. %$* 481
otherwise, their drug would not be accepted by the government. %$* 481
but yet we've heard that there were these experiments that were done without any government imprimatur. %$* 481
we have no idea what the safety controls were in those experiments or how far along in the lifecycle of the child that was born that we have to investigate. %$* 481
so i think safety is very important, and any society has to set up the standards of safety before they do any kind of test. %$* 481
we have time for one more question. %$* 13
i said i'd get back to you. %$* 13
make it great. %$* 13
my name is kate mccloud if we permit this technology, it sounds very expensive to me, so who will it be available to, and who will be restricted from having access to the technology? %$* 493
sheldon krimsky, do you want to take that on your side? %$* 13
i'm going to go to the other side, as well. %$* 13
or robert? %$* 13
well, let me speak for the other side, because-- %$* 482
because, actually, poor things, i think they need a bit of support. %$* 482
actually-- %$* 482
there really-- %$* 482
there really is an issue. %$* 482
you're quite right, this technology is expensive, it would cost tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps even-- %$* 482
maybe even $100,000 to start with. %$* 482
but actually caring for a child that's got a serious genetic disorder is far more expensive. %$* 482
and, of course, the expense of that care is not only the expense, the money, but also the tragedy, the distress, the pain, and all the rest of it. %$* 482
so i think we have to be careful and cautious about the financial arguments, and i'm sure that lee and nita would agree with me. %$* 482
you spoke for me. %$* 484
we're so glad we've convinced you to join our side. %$* 483
technology start out being very expensive become more optimized over time and become cheap. %$* 484
everybody thought computer technology was too expensive 20 or 30 years ago and now everybody has computers on their desk. %$* 484
and that concludes round 2 of this intelligence squared u.s.debate, where our motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies." and now you are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each and these are their last chances to change your mind. %$* 13
remember you were asked to vote once before the arguments and you'll be asked to vote immediately afterwards, and then we'll very quickly have the results. %$* 13
on to round 3, closing statements. %$* 13
our motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies," and here to summarize his position against the motion, lee silver, he is professor of molecular biology at princeton and author of the book "challenging nature." %$* 13
a friend of mine here was introduced to me by another friend of mine here, who had a baby with a sperm donor, i met her in 2009.and a few days after her child's birth she got a call from her doctor, who told her to go into the bedroom to check on her sleeping baby to see if he was still alive. %$* 484
the baby had been born with mcad deficiency; he had inherited this mutation from both my friend and the sperm donor who contributed to the conception. %$* 484
and the mutation was in her genome, and it had been in the genome of her family for hundreds of years, at least, and it was silent; nobody knew about this mutation. %$* 484
with a particular dietary plan, my friend's son is now a healthy five-year-old boy, happy ending to that story. %$* 484
and she and her wife decided to have another child with a sperm donor. %$* 484
so they went to the sperm bank and tested the new donor that they were going to use for mutations in the mcad gene, and they found the donor was free of mutations in the mcad gene, which the genetic counselor said should ease her mind. %$* 484
but, in fact, that shouldn't have eased her mind, because mcad is just one of the hundreds of mutations that she actually has in her genome, so even if the sperm donor had not had mcad mutation, it's just as possible that he had another mutation that was not compatible with her dna. %$* 484
so that's the important point that i want to make here that is very important for all of us to remember: there's no perfect baby, there's no perfect person, there's no perfect genome, there's no one human genome. %$* 484
we are all just a combination of many different genetic variants that makes us different from each other for better and for worse. %$* 484
thank you, lee silver. %$* 13
the motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies," and here to summarize his position in support of prohibition, sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
he is a professor at tufts university and chair of the council for responsible genetics. %$* 13
so it is perfectly understandable why parents would want to provide as much enrichment to their child as possible to ensure their success in life. %$* 481
but prenatal genetic engineering is not enrichment of a newborn, it is an effort to redesign the human genome. %$* 481
science has succeeded in applying genetic modification for enhancement to animals and crops, some would say successfully, others would say the jury is still out. %$* 481
but in the hundreds and thousands of trials that failed. %$* 481
we simply discard the results of the unwanted crop or animal. %$* 481
is this the model that civilized humane society wishes to apply to humans? %$* 481
make pinpoint genetic alterations in the human germ plasm and discard the results when they don't work out. %$* 481
it is sheer hubris to think that manipulating the human germ plasm for enhancement will not produce mistakes. %$* 481
under our current laws and civil morality, society must bear the expense to care for my severely disabled individual produce the reproductive genetic engineering. %$* 481
i'll leave you with one story. %$* 481
a little over ten years ago, scientists discovered that by modifying a mouse's gene, it greatly improved the mouse's memory. %$* 481
subsequently, they also learned that modification produced a mouse that increased sensitivity to pain. %$* 481
i want to say a word about the mitochondrial disease problem. %$* 481
some decisions appear ethical from a pinpoint perspective, but they're clearly unethical from a wider lens. %$* 481
for this, we have to look at the wider lens of genetic engineering and not at the pinpoint perspective in order to understand its ethics to society. %$* 481
thank you. %$* 481
thank you, sheldon krimsky. %$* 13
our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
and here to summarize their position against this motion, against prohibition, nita farahany. %$* 13
she is a professor at duke law and a reach professor at duke's institute for genome sciences and policy. %$* 13
this debate is quite personal to me, and i'd like to share why with you. %$* 483
in 2001, i attended the wedding of a dear friend. %$* 483
two years later, she developed thyroid cancer, and she underwent radioactive iodine treatment. %$* 483
the next year, when she and her husband started to try to have children, she learned that she had substantial mitochondrial abnormalities that she would pass on to each and every one of her children. %$* 483
she underwent mitochondrial transfer and now has a beautiful and healthy son, made possible by this technology. %$* 483
we don't know if the radioactive iodine caused those abnormalities. %$* 483
what we do know is that she now has a child-- %$* 483
healthy, active and bright-- %$* 483
from a technology that is available, and we have already used. %$* 483
in 2010, i also received radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. %$* 483
when i'm ready to have children, i hope that i also have the option of having a healthy child with whatever the best technology is that we have available to us today. %$* 483
i'm not here to defend every type of genetic engineering. %$* 483
and i don't think we're ready as a society to embrace it all. %$* 483
but we already know that there are certain forms of genetic engineering that are safe and effective to use. %$* 483
and what i urge you to do is vote against the resolution, to vote in favor of scientific progress, to vote to enable each of us as private citizens to make private choices and the most intimate choice we will ever make in life, to bring healthy children into this world. %$* 483
thank you. %$* 483
thanks nita farahany. %$* 13
our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
and here to summaries his position in support of the motion to prohibit, robert winston. %$* 13
he is a professor of science and society and emeritus professor of fertility studies at imperial college london. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, don't be seduced by a single, very heartrending story. %$* 482
that is really not at issue here. %$* 482
there's a big issue for the whole of our society and for people in general. %$* 482
i regret to say that i'm saddened to see the simplistic argument about mitochondrial dna from the other side. %$* 482
we don't understand the interactions with the mitochondria. %$* 482
and already we've seen a number of horrid mishaps. %$* 482
so, of course, maybe a particular individual was lucky, but they might have been unlucky. %$* 482
how different we would have been then. %$* 482
we heard that people have a right to have a healthy child. %$* 482
of course, they don't have a right, sadly, to have a healthy child. %$* 482
what we do have a right to, though, in a democratic society, surely, is to have access to the best and the safest treatment. %$* 482
and at the moment, the safest treatment is certainly not meddling with the genome. %$* 482
it is not meddling with the mitochondrial dna. %$* 482
it is actually to look at every other way of dealing with these terrible diseases. %$* 482
we're not ready for it. %$* 482
of course, at the moment, i have no doubt it shall be banned. %$* 482
bans can always be lifted if there's more research done to show that it is worth doing. %$* 482
and it's worth bearing in mind too that we're not going to eradicate genetic defects by doing this, not remotely. %$* 482
new defects occur all the time as lee silver rightly points out. %$* 482
all of us have defective dna.30 percent of boys born with the male form of muscular dystrophy have this as a new mutation, as he well knows. %$* 482
no amount of pre- implantation diagnosis will have changed that. %$* 482
it is a particular problem. %$* 482
and that is always going to be the issue here. %$* 482
the question is how we deal with these diseases actually when we have them. %$* 482
and finally, can i just say, on a very personal note, it really is-- %$* 482
and i don't mean this patronizingly. %$* 482
it's wonderful to see young people in the audience, and it's great to see you here. %$* 482
thank you very much for sitting so patiently during these arguments. %$* 482
what i think is important to understand is that this technology is something that you will have to deal with in time. %$* 482
and i-- %$* 482
thank you, robert winston. %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
i hope-- %$* 482
i hope they show the same responsibility that we're trying to show this evening. %$* 482
thank you, robert winston. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we're going to ask you again now to go to the key pads at your seat that will register your vote. %$* 13
and we will get this readout almost instantaneously. %$* 13
remember, the motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. %$* 13
if you agree with the motion, if that means if you agree with the prohibition of it, push number one. %$* 13
and if you disagree, push number two. %$* 13
and if you remain or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and, as i said before, you can ignore the other keys, and you can correct an incorrectly keyed vote just by pressing the right one, and it'll register your last vote. %$* 13
and we're going to have the results probably in about 120 seconds from now. %$* 13
so i want to say that this has been a spectacularly-- %$* 13
spectacularly well-argued debate by both sides. %$* 13
i just want to invite a round of applause for them for what they did. %$* 13
and there are a lot of debates where i actually reject a lot of questions. %$* 13
there wasn't one bad one tonight at all. %$* 13
i just want to thank everybody in the audience for great questions that you brought up. %$* 13
we would love to have you tweet about the debate. %$* 13
as i said before, use the twitter handle @iq2us. our hashtag for this debate was #designerbabies. %$* 13
our next one comes up on wednesday, march 13th. %$* 13
the motion will be "america doesn’t need a strong dollar policy." our debaters arguing this motion, steve forbes. %$* 13
he is the chairman and editor in chief of forbes media. %$* 13
his partner will be james grant, editor and founder of the financial markets journal, grant's interest rate observer. %$* 13
tickets for our-- %$* 13
that season are available through our website, www.iq2u.s..org. %$* 13
their opponents, by the way, are-- %$* 13
one card out of my hand-- %$* 13
frederick mishkin. %$* 13
he is a former member of the board of governors of the federal reserve. %$* 13
and his partner arguing for the motion will be john taylor who is the chairman and founder of fedex-- %$* 13
fx concepts, one of the largest currency hedge funds, not fedex. %$* 13
for those of you who can't join the live audience, of course there are a lot of other ways to watch this debate. %$* 13
those of you watching live stream on fora.tv know about that, but you can also listen to these debates on npr or watch them on pbs stations across the country. %$* 13
check your local listings for air times and dates. %$* 13
just a very few-- %$* 13
very small biographical facts about our panelists tonight, though, i didn't get to share. %$* 13
i was able to tell you about the two guys on the end living in the same apartment building. %$* 13
i did not share robert winston is actually-- %$* 13
he's been made a peer for his work in the u.k.he actually is known as lord winston. %$* 13
and it was at his insistence that we dropped that tonight, because he was over here in the colonies. %$* 13
but actually we had a conference call with him last week. %$* 13
he was in the house of lords. %$* 13
and he said, "i've got to run. %$* 13
i'll call you back in ten minutes. %$* 13
i've got to go vote." so that was-- %$* 13
that was a lot of fun. %$* 13
and nita farahany, she doesn't want me to say this, but when she graduated from high school, she was the national forensic society's single best national debater in the country. %$* 13
she more or less begged me not to tell you that, so we have the queen of debaters and the lord of-- %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
we now have the final results in. %$* 13
remember, you voted twice: before the debate and again after hearing the arguments. %$* 13
the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. %$* 13
the motion is, "prohibit genetically engineered babies." let's look at the results. %$* 13
for the team that was arguing for this motion to prohibit, before the debate, 24 percent agreed, 30 percent were against, and 46 percent were divided. %$* 13
that was the preliminary vote for everybody. %$* 13
those are the first results. %$* 13
now let's look at the vote that the team arguing for the motion received in the second vote. %$* 13
the team arguing for the motion, the second vote is 41 percent. %$* 13
that's an increase of 17 percent. %$* 13
that is the number that the other team needs to beat. %$* 13
it needs to beat 17 percent. %$* 13
let's see how the other team did. %$* 13
before, they were 30 percent. %$* 13
they went up to 49 percent. %$* 13
that's a 19 percent difference. %$* 13
they just pushed by. %$* 13
the team arguing against prohibition of genetically engineered babies carries this debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13

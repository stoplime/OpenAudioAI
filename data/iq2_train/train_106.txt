and we used force in syria against iran’s proxy there. %$* 334
and we stood up and fought militia in iraq. %$* 334
and that may well be in their interest. %$* 334
the proposition on the table is, is this good for america? %$* 334
a destabilized-- %$* 140
middle east is bad for the united states. %$* 140
yeah, and phil, so is proliferation in the middle east bad for america. %$* 336
i mean, the saudis have made it very clear that they want the deal that iran is going to get. %$* 336
so, the saudis are going to have a one-year breakout capability, as are the emiratis. %$* 336
the turks are going to want that. %$* 336
a deal that was designed to stop proliferation is enabling proliferation. %$* 336
a nuclear armed middle east with nuclear threshold states to turn the screw from a nuclear weapon is bad for america. %$* 336
that’s why obama’s deal is bad for america. %$* 336
so, i want to remind you that we’re in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: obama’s iran deal is good for america. %$* 13
tom pickering. %$* 13
john, we’ve strayed a long way from that-- %$* 335
but i cannot help to ask-- %$* 335
good point. %$* 13
who here has heard of isis? %$* 335
here is michael suggesting that in fact the iranian opposition to isis is somehow in iraq a dangerous development for american interests. %$* 335
that, i find, very hard to jump to that conclusion. %$* 335
i just wanted to make sure that you understood that thinking. %$* 335
i want to-- %$* 140
i’d like to explain that. %$* 140
my name is devon %$* 19
i just would like to pose a question to both sides concerning the narrative coming out of both countries on this agreement. %$* 19
one reads about an iranian narrative that sounds substantially different, but i’m sure you are negotiating with just those people, so i just wondered what the-- %$* 19
what the explanation is for quite a discrepancy there. %$* 19
phil gordon. %$* 13
it’s actually explanation because there’s not a great discrepancy. %$* 334
i’d actually urge you to read-- %$* 334
the belfer center at harvard did a really nice comparison of the u.s.fact sheet and what iranians have been saying, because a lot of people have picked up on this. %$* 334
you know, it’s a different agreement, and they don’t really agree to it. %$* 334
not surprisingly, each side is emphasizing what it gets and minimizing what it’s giving. %$* 334
and the iranians are really doing that. %$* 334
but when you actually look at what the iranians have said, they don’t take issue with our fact sheet. %$* 334
they’ve called it “spin,” and they’ve emphasized what they don’t have to do. %$* 334
but it’s, i dare say on their side, all spin. %$* 334
right? %$* 334
so, you know, they’ll emphasize all of the things that they’ll preserve without-- %$* 334
they’ll have a 300-kilogram stockpile. %$* 334
this sort of overlooked the fact that they’re going to give up 98 percent of what they currently have. %$* 334
and they’ll have 5,000 operating centrifuges. %$* 334
they don’t emphasize the fact that to get there they have to dismantle more than 5,000 others. %$* 334
so if you actually look at the details of the two sides, you don’t find a huge gap. %$* 334
you find a huge gap in emphasis, but they don’t-- %$* 334
they don’t deny the agreement that we articulated %$* 334
mark dubowitz. %$* 13
well, that’s totally right. %$* 336
there’s no big gap because iranians know exactly what they’re getting. %$* 336
they’re getting a great deal. %$* 336
they understand that they’re getting to preserve their entire nuclear infrastructure. %$* 336
they understand that 6,000 centrifuges keep them a year away from breakout. %$* 336
now, wait a second, tom. %$* 336
wait a second. %$* 336
wait a second. %$* 336
wait a second. %$* 336
ninety percent of their low enriched uranium, that’s their entire infrastructure? %$* 335
i got a fact sheet here. %$* 336
centrifuges. %$* 335
i got a fact sheet-- %$* 336
tom. %$* 336
all right. %$* 13
they take the-- %$* 13
tom, tom, tom. %$* 336
of their reactors. %$* 335
is that their entire infrastructure? %$* 335
tom, let him-- %$* 13
let him make his point, and then you’re going to get the floor. %$* 13
all right, go ahead, mark. %$* 13
the fact of the matter is that this iranian regime understands very well that they are going to get a significant nuclear infrastructure that will expand over time. %$* 336
it’ll be industrial sized. %$* 336
it’ll be massive, and they’ll have zero breakout. %$* 336
tom and phil, you have not explained to us, when iran reaches zero breakout in year 15-- %$* 336
in fact, president obama said, in an interview with npr, that they’re going to reach near zero breakout by year 13. you haven’t explained to the audience, and you haven’t explained to us how near zero breakout or breakout or undetectable breakout is a good deal for america. %$* 336
do 12 seconds reminding everybody what the term “breakout” technically means. %$* 13
“breakout” means the length of time it takes to weaponize a bomb’s worth of uranium. %$* 336
it effectively means the most difficult element of developing a nuclear weapon and the element of developing a nuclear weapon that is easiest for us to detect. %$* 336
all right. %$* 13
it’s very difficult for us to detect warhead design in a laboratory. %$* 336
19 seconds %$* 13
it’s complicated stuff, you know-- %$* 336
the bottom line is if the government decides on march 1st that they want to build a bomb, their argument, it’s going to take a year to get one, or they’re going to have it in may is what we want to get to. %$* 13
breakout and tom will do infrastructure. %$* 334
specifically breakout timeline is the amount of time that would be required to accumulate enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon. %$* 334
and we err on the side of caution when we calculate it. %$* 334
they’ve actually been at two months for quite a long time. %$* 334
when you keep asking, we don’t have to deal with that. %$* 334
they’re there now, today, as we sit here. %$* 334
but you should address the virtually preserved infrastructure %$* 334
just-- %$* 335
just one point. %$* 335
with too much breakout and no agreement, we have a problem. %$* 335
secondly, this infrastructure-- %$* 335
breakout and no-- %$* 336
with zero breakout in 15 years, tom, we have a huge problem. %$* 336
zero breakout. %$* 336
and who-- %$* 335
and that was because we needed zero enrichment to solve the problem. %$* 335
no, tom, you’re conflating issues. %$* 336
not at all. %$* 335
that was the key question. %$* 335
tom, under this agreement, president obama has said-- %$* 336
i was asked to respond to your point-- %$* 335
mark. %$* 13
on infrastructure. %$* 335
tom. %$* 13
and i just said carefully and quietly-- %$* 335
giving up 90 percent of your low enriched-- %$* 335
98 percent of your low enriched uranium-- %$* 335
is certainly preserving your infrastructure. %$* 335
getting rid of 14,000 of 20,000 centrifuges is getting rid of your infrastructure-- %$* 335
it’s not getting rid of your infrastructure. %$* 335
it’s preserving it. %$* 335
keeping the arak reactor in a position where it can make kilograms of weapons grade plutonium per year, but taking it out of that particular capacity, that’s certainly keeping the infrastructure in place. %$* 335
and we could go on. %$* 335
but those three examples, in my view, are serious degradations of iraq’s nuclear infrastructure. %$* 335
john, could i make a quick-- %$* 140
ma’am, you can-- %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
you go ahead, tom, while that mic gets up here. %$* 13
just quickly, on the question about whether the fact sheets of the iranians and the u.s.contradict each other, there was two ways in which they contradict each other greatly. %$* 140
one is on the question of immediate sanctions relief and the other is the question of anytime, anywhere-- %$* 140
anytime, anywhere inspections. %$* 140
not at all. %$* 335
the iranians-- %$* 335
sorry, sorry, tom. %$* 140
sorry, tom. %$* 140
tom, tom, just a second, tom. %$* 140
tom, hang on. %$* 13
and the third point-- %$* 140
and the third point, tom keeps saying they’re going to get rid of centrifuges. %$* 140
they’re not going to get rid of-- %$* 140
they’re not dismantling. %$* 140
they’ve made it a point they will not dismantle a single centrifuge. %$* 140
some of them won’t be spinning, but they’re still going to exist. %$* 140
you know what’s interesting to me is i’m often asked, like, which was the hardest panel to control, and i thought it was going to be like alan dershowitz or maybe the football debate. %$* 13
but it’s the diplomats. %$* 13
that’s why we’re such successful negotiators. %$* 335
my name is stella the question is, why isn’t the solution more and more choking sanctions? %$* 19
and why does this deal have to happen right now? %$* 19
why can’t we just choke them further with sanctions until we’re in a better bargaining position to do a better deal? %$* 19
phil gordon. %$* 13
well, one reason is that’s partly what got us here. %$* 334
you know, the world, as iran started to do enrichment and move toward the potential weapons capability, go back to 2003, decided that the outcome had to be zero enrichment. %$* 334
and we insisted on that, and we insisted on that as they increased from, at the time, 160 centrifuges. %$* 334
and we said, “no, it has to be zero.” then they got up to 3,000, we said “it has to be zero.” and they had 6,000, “it has to be zero.” and we’ve done that all the way to 19,000.so we could, as you suggest, and as i think mike and mark would suggest, keep choking. %$* 334
while we choke-- %$* 334
you know, we could take that gamble. %$* 334
as i said before, we could have showed up at the talks in the first day, said “the only outcome here is zero enrichment, no civilian reactors and fill fordow with cement and let us go anywhere, anytime, including your military bases.” we could have said that. %$* 334
i’m just suggesting that had we done so, choking, choking sanctions, instead of 19,000 centrifuges, we’d get to 25, and then 30, and then they’d finish the heavy water reactor at arak, and then they’d harden fordow-- %$* 334
and then we would have another debate three years from now, and they’d be at 30,000 centrifuges and all the rest-- %$* 334
let’s-- %$* 13
let’s-- %$* 13
be careful-- %$* 334
let me-- %$* 13
let me frame a little bit of what you said into a question for your opponents because i do find it an interesting point. %$* 13
they are basically saying that if you push too hard, if you set the terms too hard, there just wouldn’t be a deal and that they’re living in the real world, and they’re-- %$* 13
the grownup world, and the non-idealistic world, and that they want to come away with a deal. %$* 13
so what is your response to that, that if you push too hard, there just isn’t going to be anything? %$* 13
well, the reality is is that i don’t believe that we should have imposed choking sanctions to these negotiations, that it’s not-- %$* 336
again, it’s the fallacy of the false alternative that phil is very good offering. %$* 336
the fact of the matter is we should increase the sanctions. %$* 336
we continue to ratchet up the pressure. %$* 336
we didn’t have to stick at zero enrichment, but we could have offered exactly what president obama offered in the beginning, which was 500 to 1,000 centrifuges. %$* 336
why the willingness on the part of the united states to continue to diminish our nuclear demands step by step? %$* 336
the fact is that the iranians fear u.s.escalation dominance. %$* 336
they began in 2003 negotiating the europeans over 13 years. %$* 336
they only increased their operating centrifuges by 9,500.that’s about 700 centrifuges a year. %$* 336
they increased their program incrementally. %$* 336
they fear escalation dominance. %$* 336
they fear our crippling sanctions. %$* 336
they fear our military power. %$* 336
and so you’re right, we could have actually increased our sanctions, but we could have done so in an incremental way. %$* 336
we could have ratcheted up the pressure. %$* 336
and most importantly, we could have stuck to our nuclear demands. %$* 336
why the rush, you ask? %$* 336
the rush is because president obama has 18 months left in his term. %$* 336
and president obama wants a legacy-capping nuclear deal. %$* 336
i said in my introduction, why not let hillary negotiate this? %$* 336
why not let marco rubio negotiate this? %$* 336
why the rush to negotiate, right? %$* 336
stick to a-- %$* 336
i’m trying to be bipartisan-- %$* 336
stick-- %$* 336
you’re being so canadian now. %$* 13
so canadian about it. %$* 336
let’s let phil gordon respond. %$* 13
let steven harper, the prime minister of canada, negotiate this deal. %$* 336
phil gordon. %$* 13
yeah, let’s just turn this all over to the canadians. %$* 334
look, an important point on number of centrifuges, because it allows me to correct the negotiating records, and mark’s suggesting that we caved on number of centrifuges, and mike said the same thing, to correct the negotiating record. %$* 334
we’ve been very consistent from the very start on what outcome we needed on enrichment. %$* 334
what we needed was a breakout timeline of a year. %$* 334
the breakout timeline is not just a function of the number of centrifuges. %$* 334
it’s a combination of the number of centrifuges, the type of centrifuges, and the stockpile that you have. %$* 334
we told iran, “there are a lot of different ways to make us comfortable that you’re at least a year away from fissile material for a bomb. %$* 334
if you want a higher number of centrifuges, then you have to have a lower stockpile or you have to rely on these old out-of-date ir-1s, because what we care about is that you can’t quickly breakout.” so you-- %$* 334
we could have gotten a lower number of centrifuges but maybe of a different type or a bigger stockpile. %$* 334
what we got was extending their breakout timeline from what we’re living with today, which, as tom said, is not where we would like to be, to an agreement that for at least a decade they’re going to be more than a year-- %$* 334
at least a year away. %$* 334
and that’s where the number of centrifuges %$* 334
we haven’t stuck to a single principle in this negotiation. %$* 140
the principle that we enunciated with the interim agreement was that they had to verify that it was a peaceful program. %$* 140
for example, the president said, “fordow is absolutely inconsistent with a peaceful program.” he caved on fordow. %$* 140
he said they don’t need enrichment at fordow, and the agreement is very clear, there will be no enrichment at fordow. %$* 334
there will be no fissile material at fordow-- %$* 334
there will be no enrichment of what? %$* 140
there’ll be no enrichment of what? %$* 140
of uranium, which is how you make a nuclear weapon. %$* 334
but there will be enrichment of what? %$* 140
there will be enrichment of what? %$* 140
and still %$* 334
can you make a nuclear weapon-- %$* 140
yeah. %$* 18
and that concludes round two-- %$* 13
of this intelligence squared u.s. debate-- %$* 13
where our motion is, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” %$* 13
sorry, sir. %$* 13
we ran out of time because, i don’t know if you’re on this guy’s side, but he just took your time up. %$* 13
he was. %$* 336
that’s my plant. %$* 336
our motion is, “obama’s iran deal is good for america,” and that concludes round two. %$* 13
now we move on to round three. %$* 13
round three will be closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be two minutes each. %$* 13
remember how you voted? %$* 13
immediately after they conclude their statements, we’ll have you vote again, and then we’ll have the results within about a minute and a half. %$* 13
so round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. %$* 13
the motion is, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” here to summarize his position supporting this motion, tom pickering, a former undersecretary of state and u.s. foreign service career ambassador. %$* 13
i want to take you to two stories that i think are important and throw light on this question. %$* 335
two years ago a few of us met with then the leading iranian negotiator. %$* 335
he said to us frankly that “for eight years we have been in the doghouse. %$* 335
ahmadinejad put us there, and we’re now coming out. %$* 335
we will come forward with a set of ideas and principles for the negotiation that will deal effectively with the problem of your suspicion about our nuclear weapon. %$* 335
and we will accept inspections, a wide variety of them. %$* 335
and we want sanctions relief. %$* 335
and if we cannot achieve this with you in a reasonable period of time, we won’t be back.” and that’s, in fact, what has happened, interestingly enough. %$* 335
and that’s where we are now. %$* 335
a second story: two weeks ago i had the opportunity on successive days to hear again from the lead negotiators on both sides. %$* 335
and as philip mentioned just a moment ago, each one of them said to us, “this is a good deal for the following reasons,” and the iranian reasons were, guess what, quite friendly to the iranian point of view and ignored the question of the major negotiating concessions they had to make. %$* 335
the americans were less so but, nevertheless, reflected their view. %$* 335
but when i sat down just as the belfer center sat down, i could not find any reason to believe that what they had said was so inconsistent that, in fact, we didn’t have a deal very close to in hand, and that nothing contravened the framework. %$* 335
we now have a new opportunity in the region, but we have a new opportunity first with iran now, to stop any effort toward a nuclear weapon. %$* 335
so, i urge you to vote “yes” when the time comes, to support this arrangement. %$* 335
it is, in my view, the answer to this difficult problem. %$* 335
thank you, tom pickering. %$* 13
the motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america,” and here to summarize his position against this motion, mike doran, a former national security council senior director for the near east and north africa. %$* 13
wishful thinking among highly intelligent and experienced people is a very common thing. %$* 140
just remember all of the very intelligent investors who put their faith in bernie madoff. %$* 140
the men sitting over here are intelligent, and they are experienced, and they are engaging in the worst kind of wishful thinking, as is the white house. %$* 140
it calls to mind ronald reagan in 1987, when he appeared before the american people and he said, “three months ago i told you that i didn’t trade arms for hostages with iran. %$* 140
today, my heart and my best intentions still tell me that that is true. %$* 140
but the evidence has shown that actually something else is true. %$* 140
i did trade arms for hostages.” now, who traded the arms for hostages? %$* 140
who was involved in that deal? %$* 140
you may recall, for those of you who are old enough, that bud mcfarlane, the former national security advisor, and ollie north, of the iran-contra scandal, went to iran with a plane-load of weapons. %$* 140
and they delivered it to the iranians. %$* 140
and in return, the iranians gave up hostages that were held by hezbollah in lebanon. %$* 140
what was the thinking behind it? %$* 140
the thinking behind it was “we’re not trading arms for hostages. %$* 140
what we’re doing is we’re finding the moderates in tehran. %$* 140
we’re making-- %$* 140
we’re reaching out across the political divide with them, and we’re going-- %$* 140
we’re going to create a new relationship. %$* 140
now, ollie north wakes up and bites off the heads of snakes for breakfast. %$* 140
bud mcfarlane was a former marine. %$* 140
ronald reagan was a very experienced politician. %$* 140
and he had this fantasy of finding the moderates in iran and coming to an agreement with them. %$* 140
and he got led down the garden path and made a fool of himself. %$* 140
the exact same thing is happening now to the-- %$* 140
to the obama administration. %$* 140
there’s a fantasy in the american national security elite that across the persian gulf, there is this ally in waiting. %$* 140
and if we just embrace it properly, everything is going to get better. %$* 140
mike doran, thank you very much. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
our motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.”and here to summarize his position favoring the motion, supporting the motion, phil gordon. %$* 13
he’s former white house coordinator for the middle east, north africa, and the gulf region. %$* 13
so, this has been a good debate. %$* 334
and we’ve had a bit of fun with it. %$* 334
but the truth is, it’s a very serious topic. %$* 334
and i have a lot of respect for a lot of the arguments that we’ve heard. %$* 334
as you sit here and think about how you want to vote, whether you believe this deal is good for america or not, i would ask you to imagine not that you’re just sitting here and you get a free vote as a citizen, but you’re the president of the united states. %$* 334
and it’s june 30th. %$* 334
and your team has come back and said, “mr. %$* 334
president, madame president, it’s been really hard, but we got the framework that we’ve talked out. %$* 334
well, we’ve got it. %$* 334
now you just have to decide if it’s good for america or not.” now, maybe mister, madame president-- %$* 334
mike and mark have persuaded you it’s not good for america and you should reject it. %$* 334
and if you do, maybe we’ll put on more sanctions, and somehow the world will follow us, even though we walked away from the agreement. %$* 334
and maybe iran will then come back to the table and agree to zero or 500 centrifuges. %$* 334
and maybe they’ll get rid of their heavy water reactor anyway. %$* 334
and maybe they’ll accept anytime, anywhere inspections, including military bases. %$* 334
and maybe they’ll recognize israel and stop terrorism. %$* 334
maybe all that will happen, speaking of fantasies-- %$* 334
because you thought this deal wasn’t good and you rejected it, and you hoped all those things would happen, mister, madame president. %$* 334
on the other hand, maybe we’ll walk away. %$* 334
we won’t be able to keep the international sanctions coalition together. %$* 334
iran will start resuming all of those things it stopped doing with the joint plan of action, stockpiling 20 percent uranium, spinning 10,000, 19,000 centrifuges and more, finishing the heavy water reactor at arak. %$* 334
and at that point, you-- %$* 334
and think about this very seriously-- %$* 334
will be faced with a choice. %$* 334
either you acquiesce and let them finish that heavy water reactor and build more centrifuges, or use military force to stop it, which would have all sorts of other consequences in the region. %$* 334
that’s what i’d ask you to think about when you decide if this agreement is good for america or not. %$* 334
i would suspect that-- %$* 334
thank you, phil gordon. %$* 13
if we got to that point-- %$* 334
thank you, phil gordon. %$* 13
your time is up-- %$* 13
the deal you walked away from would look very good indeed. %$* 334
thank you, phil gordon. %$* 13
our motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and here to summarize his position against the motion, mark dubowitz, executive director of the foundation for defense of democracies. %$* 13
phil and tom, it’s been a real pleasure. %$* 336
and i want to thank you both for your great service to our country. %$* 336
i-- %$* 336
two years ago, i went to see someone in the white house. %$* 336
that’s when the white house would still see me. %$* 336
and i met a senior white house director there. %$* 336
and at the beginning of the meeting, he said to me, mark, i want to be very clear before we start this discussion on an iran deal, that no deal is better than a bad deal. %$* 336
and i said to him, “i understand this. %$* 336
i think president obama just said that last week.” and he said, “absolutely. %$* 336
i want to reiterate no deal is better than a bad deal.”we spent about an hour and a half debating the emerging iran deal. %$* 336
and at the end of it, he was showing me out of his office. %$* 336
we were walking down the hall, and he turned to me, and he said, “mark, i just want to be clear. %$* 336
as i said at the beginning of our discussion, that a bad deal is better than no deal.” now, that’s what’s known in washington as a gaffe. %$* 336
a washington gaffe is when the white house tells you the truth. %$* 336
and i think that’s where we are at today. %$* 336
we are at, today-- %$* 336
and you’ve heard the argument from phil. %$* 336
you’ve heard the argument from tom. %$* 336
that really a bad deal is better than no deal. %$* 336
but the fact of the matter is that the fallacy of false alternatives? %$* 336
there is an alternative to a bad deal. %$* 336
it’s not no deal. %$* 336
it’s a better deal. %$* 336
our side outlined seven specific ways to make this deal better. %$* 336
they are not fictions. %$* 336
they are real alternatives. %$* 336
without go anywhere, go any time inspections into military bases, we’ll have no way of knowing whether the regime is developing warheads. %$* 336
without the ability to actually meet the scientists that have been involved in this and see the documentation and get into the parchin site that is currently being blocked and sanitized, we’ll have no way of creating a baseline for a proper verification and inspection regime. %$* 336
and without effective, peaceful snapbacks, economic leverage that helps us actually respond to iranian cheating and challenging. %$* 336
we will only be able to respond using military force. %$* 336
if you believe that economic seduction will change the hard men of this regime, then you should support their side. %$* 336
if you believe that this terror sponsoring, holocaust-denying-- %$* 336
thank you, mark dubowitz, your time is up. %$* 13
cheating regime-- %$* 336
we can see where you’re going. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes round three of this intelligence squared u.s.debate where our motion is “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” and now it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you here in new york once again to go to the key pads at your seat and register your vote a second time. %$* 13
remember to push number one if you’re for the motion, two if you’re against, three if you became or remain undecided. %$* 13
the motion: “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” sir-- %$* 13
i just wanted to say to the gentleman who was all set with the mic to stand and ask a question. %$* 13
i’m so sorry. %$* 13
i wasn’t teasing. %$* 13
so maybe afterwards you can come down and chat with the debaters and put your question to them. %$* 13
you just won’t-- %$* 13
you just won’t be on the podcast but-- %$* 13
that’s all we provide here. %$* 13
he’s a-- %$* 140
he’s a published author on this topic. %$* 140
oh, is he? %$* 13
oh, well, i’m sorry. %$* 13
i just want to say this. %$* 13
this debate was fantastic. %$* 13
and these guys were-- %$* 13
you know, that was hard and relatively technical and-- %$* 13
it’s a great audience. %$* 18
isn’t it? %$* 13
it is a great audience. %$* 13
with very good questions. %$* 13
but i appreciated that it was fairly technical and yet you made it accessible. %$* 13
and that you responded to the bell. %$* 13
and i appreciate that as well. %$* 13
just not the way you wanted to %$* 140
i want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question because the questions were all great tonight. %$* 13
they really moved the debate along, so thank you for that. %$* 13
i want to thank-- %$* 13
something i’ve been saying at the end of every debate, and i want to say it with full sincerity. %$* 13
i want to thank the people who are supporting intelligence squared. %$* 13
we are a philanthropy, and we have some key supporters, but we actually rely on a much broader basis of supporters. %$* 13
and we encourage you, if you had a good time, i want to let you know that the ticket price doesn’t come close, even close to what it costs to mount one of these. %$* 13
and so we encourage you, if you’re in the spirit, to go to our website and make a contribution. %$* 13
and our website is iq2us.org. %$* 13
you can even do it from your seat right now. %$* 13
oh, i see everybody moving to their phones. %$* 13
think about it. %$* 13
this is the last debate of our spring season here in new york, but next week we’re going to be on the road in philadelphia. %$* 13
it’s june 2nd. %$* 13
we’ll be at philadelphia’s national constitution center. %$* 13
and what we do when we’re at the national constitution center, it’s a special series. %$* 13
we look at issues but through a strictly constitutional arguments. %$* 13
so if you happen to be there, it’s a fascinating way to hear these arguments. %$* 13
we work with constitutional scholars who, like these gentlemen, also bring that complex issue down to an understandable level. %$* 13
the issue we’re going to be looking at is the constitutionality of same-sex marriage and states’ requirements or lack of requirements to license them. %$* 13
tickets are still available through our website, iq2us.org. %$* 13
also, we’re going to be, this summer, in aspen. %$* 13
we’ll be partnering with the aspen strategy group. %$* 13
that’s august 9th, and our debate is going to be on isis.and we’ll be back here. %$* 13
september our season starts again, our fall season. %$* 13
we’re putting it together, but we’ll announce the lineup this summer. %$* 13
but you can check on our website, and you’ll get our eblast. %$* 13
and the other thing is to let you know about our app. %$* 13
it’s downloadable through the apple store and through the google play store. %$* 13
and the app has all of the debates we’ve ever done, both as a podcast and as-- %$* 13
you can watch the video. %$* 13
you can look at the research that goes into the debates is there. %$* 13
you can pose questions. %$* 13
you can suggest debates. %$* 13
and a bunch of debates that we’ve been doing lately have come from audience members, so we take those seriously. %$* 13
so we really would love your participation on all of those levels. %$* 13
okay. %$* 13
so it’s all in-- %$* 13
and remember i asked you to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate on this motion: “obama’s iran deal is good for america,” and the team whose numbers change the most between those two votes will be declared our winner. %$* 13
let’s look at the first vote on this motion, “obama’s iran deal is good for america.” thirty-seven percent agreed at the outset. %$* 13
nineteen percent were against at the outset. %$* 13
a large 44 percent were undecided. %$* 13
so, those are the first votes. %$* 13
you remember, it’s the team whose numbers move the most and between these two votes. %$* 13
so in the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 50 percent. %$* 13
that means they picked up 13 percentage points. %$* 13
that is the number to beat. %$* 13
let’s look at the team against the motion. %$* 13
in the first vote, they were 19 percent. %$* 13
their second vote went up to 43 percent. %$* 13
that’s a 24 percent increase. %$* 13
that team wins. %$* 13
the argument is defeated. %$* 13
the motion is defeated by the team arguing against. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we’ll see you next time. %$* 13

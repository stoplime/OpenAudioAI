we have these debates because of the generosity of the rosenkranz foundation which started them and continue to sustain them. %$* 13
and i want to welcome to the stage, to launch things, the chairman of the rosenkranz foundation, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
nearly 18 years ago, the oslo accords were reached, which provided for mutual recognition of israel and the plo.ever since there have been outbreaks of violence and an intermittent “peace process” has been carried on with the hope of resolving the conflicts. %$* 1
very little tangible progress has been made, while israeli settlements have altered the facts on the ground is israel’s favor. %$* 1
on the other hand, the facts on the ground, in terms of world public opinion have moved decisively against israel, not only in the middle east, but in europe, and perhaps in the u.s., as well. %$* 1
against this back drop, the palestinian authority is asking the un for admission as a member state. %$* 1
a bit of background about the un is helpful. %$* 1
the un security council includes five permanent members, the us, china, russia, france, and the uk.any one of these can veto the admission of palestine. %$* 1
in contrast, the general assembly, in which all members vote equally, can acknowledge palestine’s status as a state, but only as a non member. %$* 1
granting palestine status as a member state would reinforce the un’s long standing resolutions in favor of a two state solution, express its disapproval of israel’s settlements policy and the difficulties it has imposed on the lives of palestinians living in the west bank. %$* 1
it would lend moral authority to the palestinian cause, and might induce israel to take a more conciliatory posture in negotiations. %$* 1
the us could exercise its veto power in the security council but at a cost in terms of our relations with the arab world. %$* 1
and even a vote by the general assembly to grant palestine status as a non member state might give the palestinians access to the international criminal court, where they could legally challenge the israel occupation. %$* 1
on the other hand, nothing the un can do will alter the facts on the ground. %$* 1
nothing will resolve the dysfunctional, fragmented, conflict ridden, often corrupt, character of palestinian attempts at self- government. %$* 1
nothing will get the palestinians to develop a coherent negotiating position, or to provide realistic assurances that agreements once reached would be enforced. %$* 1
prior un resolutions have endorsed the goal of palestinian sovereignty. %$* 1
a un admission of palestine would be a redundant expression of hope, rather than a meaningful step toward peace. %$* 1
debates about israel and the middle east are always heated. %$* 1
tonight’s debate should generate light as well. %$* 1
we have an outstanding group of experts to illuminate these vexing issues, and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to our moderator, john donvan. %$* 1
thank you, robert. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and may i just invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz for making this possible. %$* 13
yes or no to this statement: the un should admit palestine as a full member state. %$* 13
it is a statement that divides us, but it's one that is worthy of fair and open debate. %$* 13
and that's what this is, another debate from intelligence squared us.i'm john donvan. %$* 13
welcome. %$* 13
we have two teams, four superbly qualified debaters, all of whom have lived at the heart of this argument. %$* 13
and it's an argument that, let's face it, in our lifetime, has seemed to be rather permanent, the way that the berlin wall once seemed permanent, but turned out not to be, or apartheid in south africa seemed permanent, but turned out not to be. %$* 13
but israel and palestine, this is the one that seems never to end. %$* 13
and why is that? %$* 13
well, nothing helps expose the fault lines like a good debate. %$* 13
and debaters who are trying to make you understand their point of view and maybe get you to see something in a way that you have never seen it before. %$* 13
we go in three rounds of debate. %$* 13
then the audience votes on the winning debate. %$* 13
only one side wins. %$* 13
our motion is "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." and to meet our debaters, mustafa barghouthi, you are a palestinian, a former presidential candidate in the palestinian authority. %$* 13
you are a nobel peace prize nominee because you lead a party that is adamantly devoted to peaceful resistance to the israeli occupation. %$* 13
and just very briefly, before we get started, what do you think is the point in this debate that your opponents don't understand yet, that you want to make them understand? %$* 13
i think the point is that admitting palestine to the un as a full member is in the best interest not only of the palestinian people, but also of israeli people. %$* 596
thank you. %$* 13
and that it is in the best interest of peace with everybody. %$* 596
thank you, mustafa. %$* 13
your teammate, who is also arguing for admission, daniel levy. %$* 13
it's going to surprise some people that daniel levy arguing on this side is actually a citizen of the state of israel. %$* 13
you were also a negotiator on the israeli side in negotiations with palestinians. %$* 13
and daniel, from your point of view again, knowing that many of your fellow israelis would oppose admission, what do you want the doubters to hear tonight? %$* 13
well, doubt is okay. %$* 597
skepticism is healthy. %$* 597
but we can't pretend the palestinians away. %$* 597
and time isn't healing this. %$* 597
so not acting to facilitate the palestinian state is just a dereliction of responsibility to ourselves and to future generations. %$* 597
and because i just mispronounced your name, i'm going to repeat the first sentence i said. %$* 13
your team, and also arguing for the motion, daniel levy. %$* 13
i will be consistent with that from this point on. %$* 13
our motion is this: "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." and arguing against the motion, dore gold, you are at the united nations as israel's representative. %$* 13
you are an advisor to prime minister netanyahu. %$* 13
you have been around the block on this one for years and years and years. %$* 13
and my question to you is what do you think the audience needs to hear tonight that they've never considered before? %$* 13
i'm sorry. %$* 598
i have to correct you. %$* 598
i'm currently not an advisor. %$* 598
i'm a private citizen. %$* 598
but nonetheless, i'll answer your question. %$* 598
does he listen to what you say? %$* 13
have to ask him. %$* 598
look, the position i am taking has nothing to do with recognition of the palestinians. %$* 598
it has nothing to do with national dignity, which every people is entitled to. %$* 598
it has everything to do with undertaking an act which will create chaos, precisely at a time when the middle east is more dangerous than ever. %$* 598
thank you very much. %$* 13
and your partner is aaron david miller. %$* 13
aaron, you are a former u.s.middle east negotiator, a public policy scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars. %$* 13
and you also have been involved in this at the negotiating table as an american and as the american at the table for 20 years. %$* 13
and what do you want your audience to key in on tonight? %$* 13
john, thanks-- %$* 138
thanks for having all of us. %$* 138
no more illusions is my trope. %$* 138
americans and israelis have had their fair share. %$* 138
and now the palestinians have theirs. %$* 138
un admission in the absence of an agreement between israelis and palestinians will not take the palestinians any closer to the full sovereign state that they deserve. %$* 138
thank you, aaron david miller. %$* 13
so we've heard from all of our debaters. %$* 13
we've met them all. %$* 13
and shortly, we're going to move on to round one. %$* 13
but first we want to ask you to go to the key pads at your seat and take a look again at our motion: "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." if you agree with this motion at this point, push number one, if you disagree, please push number two, and if you are undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and if you've made an error, just correct your vote, and the last vote will be registered. %$* 13
these will be tabulated. %$* 13
we're going to hold this result till the end of the debate. %$* 13
we'll have a second vote. %$* 13
we'll ask you in that second vote to judge which team presented the better arguments. %$* 13
and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so onto round one, opening statements from each debater in turn. %$* 13
they will be seven minutes each. %$* 13
our motion is, "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." up for the motion first, "the un should admit palestine as a full member state," former israeli government negotiator, senior fellow at the new america foundation where he is co-director of the middle east task force, daniel levy. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 597
ladies and gentlemen, on october 10, 1971, the united nations admitted the people's republic of china as a member and kicked out taiwan. %$* 597
if that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight, i would not be standing here arguing in favor. %$* 597
what we are proposing is to admit palestine at the u.n.not instead of israel but alongside israel, unfinished u.n.business from the middle of the last century. %$* 597
let me first clear up what i hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight. %$* 597
we have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, "does palestine meet the criteria of montevideo for statehood? %$* 597
" law matters, but this is primarily a political, not a legal question. %$* 597
and it's not about the united nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution. %$* 597
it can be both, and israel of course went to the u.n.to get its own birth certificate endorsed. %$* 597
but the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm. %$* 597
we do not have anyone here advocating a greater jewish israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities. %$* 597
the territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious. %$* 597
approximately 600,000 israelis, one in 10 israeli jews live beyond the green line. %$* 597
settlements grow. %$* 597
outposts are legalized. %$* 597
i invite you to go and see the reality. %$* 597
and it's not just a physical manifestation of blurring. %$* 597
it is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of israelis live. %$* 597
prime minister netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states, but he has not walked the walk. %$* 597
his own likud party platform opposes two states, and one must take seriously the jewish-israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing, then we got balfour, then we got the '47 partition, then we got 78 percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we're not going anywhere. %$* 597
that's a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in new hampshire tonight's part of that amen corner. %$* 597
passivity cannot be the response. %$* 597
if we want two states, we have to act. %$* 597
and u.n.admission for palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment. %$* 597
we need to be deeply respectful of the choices that israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that israeli conversation. %$* 597
indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament. %$* 597
and we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we're making it easier for israeli society to change course. %$* 597
we are not. %$* 597
the cost benefit calculation of israelis needs to look different. %$* 597
do we really think that israel is waiting to leave the territory, it's just waiting, and the palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough, and that's the key to unlock this? %$* 597
let's acknowledge that it's not going to be easy but the current policies aren't helping. %$* 597
what, then, can be done? %$* 597
the palestinians do actually have options, violence. %$* 597
i'm against that. %$* 597
that's illegitimate. %$* 597
they can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning. %$* 597
i can see its legitimacy, but i'm not an advocate of that. %$* 597
or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay down a marker to get the attention of israelis. %$* 597
that's what u.n.membership is, and i would argue it correlates with what is best, therefore, for israel. %$* 597
we can't expect the palestinians to wait forever, and we can't say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the u.n.but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state. %$* 597
suggesting the palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it's also immoral. %$* 597
so if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can't impose a solution and if we can't even prevent deterioration, if we can't even get a settlement freeze, then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea? %$* 597
we vote to admit palestine to the u.n.and we vote for this motion tonight. %$* 597
u.n.membership is not a silver bullet. %$* 597
it’s not a panacea. %$* 597
it’s not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the middle east. %$* 597
but it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future. %$* 597
we will no doubt be told that this can’t happen, that it’s meaningless symbolism, and especially not now with the arab spring. %$* 597
wrong. %$* 597
yes, the u.s.has committed to a veto. %$* 597
no doubt, we’ll discuss that. %$* 597
but does that make this debate pointless? %$* 597
can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation? %$* 597
if that’s the case, i strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in march about banning college football, because it won’t be. %$* 597
and that can always be an argument. %$* 597
i urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than negotiations. %$* 597
those negotiations are asymmetrical. %$* 597
one side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure. %$* 597
negotiations cannot be the singular tool in our toolkit. %$* 597
and finally, if we are concerned about israel’s security, then let’s acknowledge that hope too is a security currently. %$* 597
hopelessness encourages violence. %$* 597
there will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli. %$* 597
and perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself contributes to insecurity and israeli democracy. %$* 597
eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist. %$* 597
not to dramatize, but if we don’t have a palestine, we are saying kaddish. %$* 597
we are saying the right of prayer, of last prayer for israeli democracy. %$* 597
i urge you to support this motion, to support the principle of palestine alongside israel at the u.n. thank you. %$* 597
thank you, daniel levy. %$* 13
thank you, daniel levy. %$* 13
our motion is “the u.n.should admit palestine as a full member state.” and here to speak against the motions, aaron david miller. %$* 13
for over two decades, he advised six secretaries of state, shaping u.s.policy on the middle east in the arab-israeli peace process. %$* 13
he is a public fellow at the woodrow wilson center. %$* 13
john, thank you very much. %$* 138
and thank all of you for coming. %$* 138
daniel, i’ve known you for many years. %$* 138
i admire your passion and your intellect. %$* 138
you’re a powerful advocate of israeli-palestinian peace, of logic and common sense. %$* 138
all of this, however, does not address the fundamental problem, the conundrum now, daniel. %$* 138
we’re dealing with a conundrum. %$* 138
we are stuck. %$* 138
violence will never produce sovereignty for palestinians, but neither will negotiations right now. %$* 138
so the question is what to do. %$* 138
what you are suggesting, in my judgment, is that we take an action that is not simply neutral, that will retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is. %$* 138
and mustafa will agree. %$* 138
dore may even agree. %$* 138
it is simply no justification for proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will not bring palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty. %$* 138
i speak here not as an israeli to you and not as a palestinian. %$* 138
i speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an american, absorbed in this process for many years, 25 years. %$* 138
and during the course of that period, i developed a faith in three primary assumptions: number one, there was a solution, equitable and durable; number two, negotiations were the only way to achieve it. %$* 138
and negotiations is flawed and it’s imperfect because it’s based on human frailty and weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise; and finally, that the united states had a critical role to play in this process by being fair, by being tough and by being reassuring-- %$* 138
all of these assumptions. %$* 138
any honest man or woman would acknowledge and the situation, you’re quite correct, dan, it will be worse. %$* 138
it will get worse before it gets worse. %$* 138
but the question still has to be addressed. %$* 138
how will granting the putative state of palestine admission as a full-member state into the u.n. address any of this? %$* 138
now, i’m here to argue in six basic points. %$* 138
i don’t want to bore you. %$* 138
i’m not here to entertain you, but to leave you with perhaps a baker’s dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why i believe this is a bad idea. %$* 138
and, by the way, i concede, particularly to you, daniel, that i know bad ideas when i see them. %$* 138
i know illusions when i see them. %$* 138
i was responsible, over the course of a 20-year period, for quite a few, as mustafa will attest, perhaps even dore. %$* 138
but not tonight. %$* 138
i have no illusions tonight. %$* 138
first, as an american whose country sits on the security council, i cannot, in all good conscience, recommend the admission of a putative state however morally or ethically compelling it may be as a full member state. %$* 138
prime minister salam fayyad, the man who has done more to build institutions of palestinian statehood on the ground is against this proposition because he knows it'll undermine the work that he has done. %$* 138
it'll undermine the institutions. %$* 138
palestine has no borders. %$* 138
it has no control over its population. %$* 138
it has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own society. %$* 138
in short, it does not control the guns, all of the guns in its society. %$* 138
i would argue that's critically important for statehood. %$* 138
yes, much of this may be due to the israeli occupation. %$* 138
but that doesn't change the reality. %$* 138
admission of palestine now will create a situation in which it cannot discharge its own obligations as a member state, in large part because half of its government, the rival palestinian national movement doesn't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate conflicts. %$* 138
mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of un membership. %$* 138
second, as an american, i'd oppose this because i believe it's not symbolic. %$* 138
it's not symbolic at all. %$* 138
it's a prescription, and an rx, if you will, for instability and perhaps even escalation. %$* 138
think about it. %$* 138
we are admitting the palestinian authority that presumes to control palestine into the un when in fact two other entities, one, the state of israel, an ally of the united states, and the second factor and force, hamas, an entity which is an adversary of the united states, has more control over what transpires in palestine, this putative state than the palestinian authority. %$* 138
that is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence. %$* 138
mustafa will tell you, and he may be right, that the basis for this negotiation, and the basis of-- %$* 138
for any palestinian state will be june 4, '67 borders. %$* 138
but admitting palestine into the un will mean that a palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to defend those borders. %$* 138
i wouldn't want-- %$* 138
i mean, maybe you see this as a blessing. %$* 138
i see it as a huge contradiction, to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has to defend borders that he cannot defend. %$* 138
and what is he to say to his public when the israelis continue to do what they will do? %$* 138
which brings me to my third point. %$* 138
there will be an israeli reaction. %$* 138
and who is going to control that reaction? %$* 138
the united states? %$* 138
the international community? %$* 138
as israel seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries, to basically say to the palestinians, fine, you have now set your boundaries. %$* 138
june 4, '67, is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return to the table. %$* 138
but we're going to set ours now as well. %$* 138
we will set our boundaries. %$* 138
and we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of solution. %$* 138
for, if the palestinians want to pick a fight with the americans, that's their business. %$* 138
but i would argue it's counterproductive. %$* 138
you're going to have an election in november. %$* 138
and i'm not talking as a republican or as a democrat. %$* 138
but anybody looking at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting palestinian statehood, you probably would want to see the re-election of the current president. %$* 138
you would probably want to see the re-election of the current president, which would mean essentially that you're not going to force him into a position to take action that will weaken the prospects of his own election. %$* 138
finally, i'll come back to my initial point. %$* 138
just because we're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that's going to take us farther away than ever from our goal. %$* 138
admission of palestine now without an agreement will take palestinians farther away from sovereignty. %$* 138
thank you, aaron david miller. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
a reminder of what's going on. %$* 13
we are halfway through the opening statements in this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: "the un should admit palestine as a full member state."you have heard the first two opening statements, and now onto the third. %$* 13
to debate in support of this motion that the un should admit palestine as a full member state, palestinian democracy activist, secretary general of the palestinian national initiative and nobel peace prize nominee, mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
thank you so much. %$* 596
and thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate. %$* 596
i have four reasons that i would like to emphasize why palestine should be admitted to the un.the first is that time is not an infinite commodity. %$* 596
and time-- %$* 596
we're losing time. %$* 596
and with the continuation of israeli settlements on the ground, which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution. %$* 596
if palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution. %$* 596
and the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody. %$* 596
so we need the un in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which mr. %$* 596
miller is defending. %$* 596
what mr. %$* 596
miller has suggested and what probably mr. %$* 596
gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance. %$* 596
what-- %$* 596
and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards palestinians and irresponsible towards israelis as well. %$* 596
what they are proposing is to continue what einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. %$* 596
it also indicates, as i suspect mr. %$* 596
gold will show, such a position against un admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the palestinian people to be free. %$* 596
continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese. %$* 596
one side, the palestinian side, is stuck behind bars. %$* 596
the israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating. %$* 596
at the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about. %$* 596
and that is not a solution. %$* 596
so my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the united states for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy. %$* 596
we have one of three options. %$* 596
either palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for. %$* 596
in this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where palestinians are discriminated against. %$* 596
and israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about. %$* 596
or the second option is violence, which we reject, and we don't want. %$* 596
the third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like gandhi did in india, and like martin luther king did here in the united states. %$* 596
and that's the course we are taking. %$* 596
and that's why going to the un is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road. %$* 596
my third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the united nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign. %$* 596
if we speak about the right of people in south sudan and in kosovo and in libya and in syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not palestine? %$* 596
and why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting palestine in the un would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made. %$* 596
since 1947 resolution the united states spoke about two states, israel was established. %$* 596
palestine was not. %$* 596
my last point is that we know that admitting palestine to the united nations would not immediately create a change on the ground. %$* 596
we understand, but it will achieve three goals. %$* 596
first, it will give us hope. %$* 596
it will give palestinians hope. %$* 596
hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle. %$* 596
desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things. %$* 596
second, accepting palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by israel and by creating settlements. %$* 596
and, third, it will send a message to the israelis that they will not be really free unless palestinians are also free. %$* 596
we are now victims of oppression and discrimination. %$* 596
the israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear. %$* 596
and mr. %$* 596
gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the arab spring. %$* 596
instead of israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear. %$* 596
this is not the right approach. %$* 596
we want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the united nations, but we also want to liberate the israelis as well. %$* 596
martin luther king liberated the united states, not only the african-americans, from segregation as well as mandela liberated the whole of south africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating south africa from apartheid. %$* 596
and that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system, and to liberate the israelis from fear, from the security phobia. %$* 596
one time a palestinian leader came to the united nations with a gun and an olive branch. %$* 596
today we are coming to the united nations with two olive branches. %$* 596
don't let us drop them. %$* 596
thank you. %$* 596
thank you, mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
our motion is "the u.n.should admit palestine as a full member state." our final debater is going to speak against the motion. %$* 13
he's dore gold, world renowned expert on middle eastern affairs. %$* 13
he's former prime minister of israel's foreign policy advisor and former ambassador to the united nations. %$* 13
dore gold. %$* 13
those of you who are voting tonight should remember that we're speaking about palestinian membership at the u.n., we're not in new hampshire. %$* 598
when i served as israel's ambassador to the united nations back in the late 1990s, i had a colleague, a counterpart, who was the u.s.ambassador to the united nations, became a very close friend, it's someone i intellectually admired. %$* 598
his name, unfortunately he's passed away, was richard holbrooke. %$* 598
and one of the things i was struck by, before i was sent to the u.n.i was the israeli negotiator. %$* 598
i was sent to the sand dunes of gaza where muhammad picked me up in that extended mercedes and take me to arafat's house. %$* 598
we would discuss how to move forward in peace, and, by the way, those discussions were tough because he-- %$* 598
when you're in a meeting like that, you don't know where to park your head. %$* 598
should you remember the israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that came out of territory under arafat's jurisdiction? %$* 598
i know that's tough to mention, but you've got to know that. %$* 598
do you think of those people? %$* 598
do you think about the moment? %$* 598
do you think about building a future? %$* 598
do you forget about the tragedies of the past so you'll have hope? %$* 598
how do you orient yourself? %$* 598
it's very, very tough. %$* 598
but i had that experience. %$* 598
we were involved in-- %$* 598
i spent hours with mahmoud abbas, abu mazen. %$* 598
i spent a tremendous time on the hebron agreement with aaron and of course the wye agreement that followed afterwards. %$* 598
and what i had seen in the '90s is that we didn't succeed. %$* 598
we didn't succeed. %$* 598
we reached agreements. %$* 598
and, by the way, the man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner prime minister benjamin netanyahu signed two agreements with the palestinians-- %$* 598
withdrew from territory, made sacrifices for peace, risked his whole political base because he wanted to move the process forward. %$* 598
it may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles, but i experienced that. %$* 598
but let me go back to holbrooke. %$* 598
so i saw that we had a tough time moving forward. %$* 598
and after i left government in 1999 and when mr. %$* 598
ehud barak came into office. %$* 598
and barak went to camp david with yasser arafat. %$* 598
the peace wasn’t concluded. %$* 598
but i asked myself through my contacts with holbrooke, “how was it? %$* 598
” and richard holbrooke delivered the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the clinton administration, the dayton accords over bosnia. %$* 598
well, we didn’t succeed in the middle east. %$* 598
we failed at camp david. %$* 598
i’m not sure i still understand why that occurred. %$* 598
by the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between croats, bosnian muslims, the serbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial. %$* 598
it had all the ingredients that we had. %$* 598
but they persisted. %$* 598
they persisted to negotiate. %$* 598
i discerned from my discussions with holbrooke and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements. %$* 598
he concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome. %$* 598
as much as you could be cynical about tough negotiations, that’s the only outcome that will work. %$* 598
the second thing that comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that peacemaking must come from the parties themselves. %$* 598
the great breakthroughs of dayton came from those three warring parties. %$* 598
it’s true. %$* 598
they were brought to ohio. %$* 598
it’s true. %$* 598
secretary of state was in and out. %$* 598
president clinton was ready to come in. %$* 598
but they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace. %$* 598
and finally, you need diplomatic flexibility. %$* 598
let me tell you something. %$* 598
both sides, certainly in our case-- %$* 598
i can speak to israelis-- %$* 598
we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of our cause. %$* 598
but tonight’s not the night to lay that out to you. %$* 598
the point is that even though you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go on every american network from cnn to fox television and lay that out to the american audience, you have got to make a compromise. %$* 598
you’ve got to cut a deal. %$* 598
you can’t walk away. %$* 598
and because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because they knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility, in the balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal. %$* 598
in fact, holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: will the bosnians grasp an imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until dayton was convened? %$* 598
now, let me move to the issue at hand between us. %$* 598
what is my problem with the proposal that a palestinian state be recognized as a u.n. member state? %$* 598
as i said in my opening words, this isn’t about national dignity. %$* 598
you know, every people wants to recognized. %$* 598
and there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of who’s supposed to get independence-- %$* 598
kurds, tibetans, you name it-- %$* 598
every national movement wants to be recognized to the u.n. so my question isn’t about recognizing the rights of palestinians. %$* 598
that was recognized by menachem begin back at camp david in 1978.my question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold. %$* 598
first of all, carefully listening to the speech of mahmoud abbas on september 23rd this year, or last year now, at the u.n.general assembly, he wasn’t just saying, “accept us in principle.” he was laying out borders. %$* 598
and i think aaron made the reference to it, the june 4, 1967 line, as though there was some kind of pre-’67 boundary, border, that was an international line that we have to agree to. %$* 598
that’s it. %$* 598
when we signed the oslo agreements, borders were supposed to be negotiated. %$* 598
and that-- %$* 598
to that point, to that very point, yasser arafat agreed. %$* 598
he signed those agreements. %$* 598
or actually abu mazen signed the first agreement. %$* 598
the implement agreements, he later signed. %$* 598
so we're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the un. %$* 598
dore gold, i'm sorry. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
it went by quickly, but you can bring some of that in later on. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
and you can do one of those applause moments. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
so our motion is: "the un should admit palestine as a full member state." keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening because we're going to ask you to vote again at the end of the evening. %$* 13
and the team that has changed the most of your views on this motion will be declared our winner. %$* 13
so now onto round two. %$* 13
and this is where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. %$* 13
we have two teams of two. %$* 13
we have mustafa barghouthi and daniel levy who have been arguing that the un should admit palestine as a full member state for several reasons, including the fact that it introduces hope to the palestinian people, and that hope militates against violence. %$* 13
also, that in a peace process that is going nowhere, that is stuck, it lays down a marker that the israelis cannot ignore. %$* 13
the team arguing against the motion, they include dore gold and aaron david miller, are arguing against this motion on the grounds, number one, that what exists now in the territory controlled by the palestinian authority doesn't really meet the qualifications of a state because it can't control its borders, it can't control its guns. %$* 13
and they're also arguing that it is too soon to give up on negotiation itself. %$* 13
so we're going to take questions from you. %$* 13
but first from me, i want to put a question to the side arguing against the motion. %$* 13
and i think, dore, this may have been where you were heading. %$* 13
i want to understand why admission of the un-- %$* 13
why admission of palestine to the un necessarily precludes the continuation of negotiations. %$* 13
why can't there be this admission to the un, and yet negotiations continue and ultimately a solution reached? %$* 13
i mentioned that point already, which is, of course, that these are issues that have to be negotiated. %$* 598
you know, for example, one of the hard choices that mahmoud abbas has to face, one of the critical issues that he has to deal with is announcing, it's the end of the conflict. %$* 598
by going to the un, getting a palestinian state, he doesn't have to do that. %$* 598
he doesn't have to come to terms with the question that we keep raising. %$* 598
we're being asked, recognize the rights of the palestinians to an independent state. %$* 598
so we've done that. %$* 598
but we're asking the palestinians to recognize the right of the jewish people to a nation state of their own. %$* 598
that has to be in the package. %$* 598
but in fact, there-- %$* 598
there-- %$* 598
but how are you recognizing the palestinian state when you refuse to go back to '67 borders? %$* 596
because the borders have nothing to do with the existence of a state. %$* 598
the borders would be up in the air, or no borders? %$* 596
no. %$* 598
we have to work out the borders. %$* 598
we have real problems. %$* 598
you know, everyone says, oh, just get out of the gaza strip unilaterally in 2005.you won't have a full peace agreement because we didn't negotiate it unilaterally. %$* 598
and the situation will stabilize. %$* 598
sorry. %$* 597
no one says that. %$* 597
that was the initiative of the israeli prime minister. %$* 597
daniel levy. %$* 13
and he refused to-- %$* 596
no one was telling him unilaterally-- %$* 597
no one was telling us unilaterally. %$* 598
it does, but everyone said, if you end the occupation, the source of violence will end. %$* 598
gaza is 6 percent of the land mass of the remaining 22 percent of mandatory palestine that we're talking about in a two-state solution. %$* 597
no one was saying, any occupation in six percent, maintain and entrench the occupation in 94 percent and see how that goes. %$* 597
wouldn't you expect-- %$* 598
dore gold. %$* 13
wouldn't you expect that if you get out of the given territory, that the level of violence from that territory would decline? %$* 598
maybe it would go up elsewhere. %$* 598
dore, i-- %$* 13
let me-- %$* 13
wait. %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 13
dore, let-- %$* 13
let-- %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 13
dore. %$* 13
i have a right of response. %$* 598
i don't feel that you answered my question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 598
although, although you said that you had addressed it. %$* 13
my question is, you just talked about what's left to be negotiated. %$* 13
let's take borders for example. %$* 13
why not do this political gesture at the un for the palestinians? %$* 13
why would that preclude then having discussions on the borders afterwards? %$* 13
in other-- %$* 13
you were saying this stops everything. %$* 13
and i'm trying to understand why this would stop everything, and these negotiations could not continue on those points afterwards. %$* 13
well, what if the very resolution itself states that the borders will be the june 4 lines? %$* 598
is the palestinian side willing to relinquish that phraseology from a security council resolution? %$* 598
mustafa barghouthi. %$* 13
well, let me reiterate one thing. %$* 596
let's remember that in 1947 the-- %$* 596
are you going to-- %$* 13
will you answer his question? %$* 13
simple question. %$* 598
yeah, i'm answering this question. %$* 596
in 19-- %$* 596
he has-- %$* 596
he has been talking a lot, so let me 1947, it was decided there would be two states. %$* 596
israel would be on 54 percent of the land, palestine on 44 percent of the land. %$* 596
now we are accepting 22 percent. %$* 596
that's less than half of what we should have had according to the un in '47.and mr. %$* 596
gold wants to take away parts of that land because for the settlements that keep growing, israel is the only country in the world that has not told anybody what are its borders. %$* 596
why? %$* 596
but you're not answering his question. %$* 13
because-- %$* 596
his question was-- %$* 13
the resolution-- %$* 13
what about india or pakistan? %$* 598
excuse me, dore. %$* 13
why do you-- %$* 598
dore, excuse me. %$* 13
excuse me. %$* 13
and why do you keep-- %$* 598
dore, dore, excuse me. %$* 13
assertion for this totally based-- %$* 598
dore, excuse me. %$* 13
the question that he put, could there be a resolution that would not stipulate borders, that would leave that to be negotiated? %$* 13

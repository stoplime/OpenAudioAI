right. %$* 199
but there are probably people in this room who have. %$* 202
so the question fundamentally comes down to what counts as empirical. %$* 202
and in science, of course, what counts as empirical are things that we can do experiments on, we can do repeated observations. %$* 202
so science depends upon reproducibility. %$* 202
but if we were to reduce some phenomenon to a reproducible behavior, we would have reduced it not into an explanation, a definition of what a miracle is. %$* 202
we would have reduced it into magic, or we would have reduced it in a new law of nature. %$* 202
so it's in the nature of miracle that it can't be reduced into scientific form. %$* 202
and in the end, science becomes essentially powerless to say, one way or another, whether a miracle-- %$* 202
a miracle that happened, and tell me one that happened that you can show happened. %$* 199
let's let michael shermer answer. %$* 13
but even so, even if there was one, aren't you curious as a scientist how god performed the miracle, what forces of nature she used and so on to make it happen? %$* 200
of course. %$* 201
and so, for example, so we would say, as christians, for example, that-- %$* 201
thank you. %$* 200
the big bang, the creation of the universe, was a miracle. %$* 201
why was it a miracle? %$* 201
because it used no known law of nature. %$* 201
it was in a sense supernatural. %$* 201
the universe. %$* 201
but that's just because you didn't understand it. %$* 199
but you haven't-- %$* 201
see, here is the thing. %$* 201
when we talk about experiments and reproducible things, you're talking, for example, let's take, for example, are there beings on other planets, right? %$* 201
it's an empirical question. %$* 201
right now. %$* 201
in principle, it's an empirical question, yes. %$* 199
empirical question. %$* 201
right now, there is no evidence that there are creatures in outer space. %$* 201
yes. %$* 199
therefore, have you refuted that belief? %$* 201
no. %$* 199
but it's not an illogical one like the notion that-- %$* 199
you haven't refuted it because-- %$* 201
what? %$* 199
you haven't refuted it because you haven't produced-- %$* 201
it doesn't require me to suspend the laws of physics in order to believe it. %$* 199
but if i were to believe in creatures in outer space, i wouldn't be irrational, would i? %$* 201
no, no, but you've got to respond to the point he just made. %$* 13
it would not require suspension of the laws of physics in order for you to believe there are creatures in outer space. %$* 13
right. %$* 201
and i would say that-- %$* 201
but miracles do. %$* 13
no. %$* 201
miracles simply say that the laws of physics are incomplete, that the laws of physics are generalizations that reflect the limits of human knowledge. %$* 201
these aren't nature's laws. %$* 201
they're newton's laws. %$* 201
and it took an einstein to modify them. %$* 201
so when the sun stood-- %$* 199
so these biblical scientists who thought that the sun went around the earth because that's what they thought when they were writing, when the sun stopped in the sky, of course, had the sun been going around the earth, that would be fine. %$* 199
but we now know that actually the earth goes around the sun. %$* 199
and the fact that the sun moves in the skies and the fact that the earth rotates. %$* 199
so had the sun stopped in the sky, the stopping of the rotation of the earth would have produced forces which would have destroyed all life on the planet. %$* 199
but that somehow doesn't violate the basic classical physics. %$* 199
but-- %$* 199
and every now and then, that's possible? %$* 199
who are these biblical scientists you're talking about? %$* 201
well, you know, the horn blowing, the sun stopping. %$* 199
the people who thought that the earth was the center of the universe and the sun went around it were christians who, like non-christians, were taught by scientists. %$* 201
that's where they got the idea. %$* 201
they weren't biblical scientists. %$* 201
they got it from you guys. %$* 201
wait, ian, i think i hear a serious question. %$* 13
i didn't mean it that way. %$* 13
i didn't mean it that way. %$* 13
i think i hear an interesting challenge, in that lawrence is saying that if a miracle were to occur, that it has ripple effects and a broad-- %$* 13
it doesn't just affect the people who are witnessing the miracle. %$* 13
okay. %$* 202
but if-- %$* 13
for example, if the earth stopped because the trumpets are blowing, on the other side of the earth, you know, some tribe doesn't know what's going on, but suddenly the earth has stopped for them too. %$* 13
how do they explain it? %$* 13
so in the 18th century, as science really got going, people thought that there were deterministic laws of physics and that once you understood the initial conditions, you could solve those laws and the result was absolutely determined. %$* 202
i think lawrence will agree that what science has found out in the 20th century is that that is simply not true, that there is, in the universe as a whole, as we discover it by science, some deep uncertainties, some undefined behavior which, in the end, cannot be considered to be deterministic. %$* 202
in other words, a deterministic universe in which there's no room for god to operate is simply not the way we think about the universe as physicists these days. %$* 202
michael shermer. %$* 13
let's say, ian, that petitionary prayer actually works. %$* 200
again, as a physicist-- %$* 200
petitionary prayer, you mean, i would like something to happen, and you pray for it. %$* 13
petitioning to the deity to, say, cure my cancer or whatever. %$* 200
and it happens. %$* 200
wouldn't you be curious to know how the deity or whatever it is reaches into the world, stirs the particles, reconfigures the dna so the cancer cells quit replicating so rapidly and so on. %$* 200
and the moment you figure that out as a scientist, it would no longer be a miracle. %$* 200
it wouldn't be supernatural. %$* 200
it would just be part of nature. %$* 200
it's like, so if i recant this prayer six times between 10:00 a.m. %$* 200
and 11:00 a.m., this is the effect. %$* 200
it's a measurable, determined thing. %$* 200
that's just now incorporated as part of science. %$* 200
well, let's be clear that it's never been a religious position that if we have a natural explanation for something, that means that god is absent or that god didn't do it. %$* 202
it's always been a biblical viewpoint that even on things which we know are part of nature, god can be considered to be active in those things. %$* 202
so while this discussion on miracles is interesting in itself, one shouldn't be misled into thinking that the only place that god can act in the world is through those things which are so extraordinary that %$* 202
john, i just want to correct an error that-- %$* 199
i mean, i don't think you %$* 199
lawrence krauss. %$* 13
so i want to just make it clear. %$* 199
the laws of physics are deterministic. %$* 199
the schrödinger equation which is the basis of quantum mechanics is a second order differential equation, and, therefore, the laws are deterministic. %$* 199
our observations aren't deterministic, but the underlying laws are deterministic. %$* 199
nothing's changed in 400 years. %$* 199
and so it's really important-- %$* 199
there’s no way the universe isn't deterministic. %$* 202
–it’s governed by quantum mechanics. %$* 18
just one thing, because we got into four syllables, and i'm not that smart. %$* 13
just give us a working definition of the word "deterministic." you mean-- %$* 13
you start with an initial condition for the equations of quantum mechanics, and the evolution of the system is determined unambiguously-- %$* 199
it has to happen. %$* 18
it has no uncertainty. %$* 199
your measurement of the system has uncertainty, but the evolution of the underlying system is completely determined. %$* 199
you know, i'll accept the slight correction-- %$* 202
good. %$* 199
that-- %$* 202
but the point, nevertheless, remains exactly the way i said it, which is that the universe is not deterministic. %$* 202
what science does is try to explain the universe by deterministic laws, and by looking at the world and trying to say, "how is it completely reproducible and in accordance with these universal laws? %$* 202
" and what it finds out is that no matter how hard we try, we're actually unable to have a complete description of the universe of that type. %$* 202
and this was such a shock that even as great a scientist as albert einstein was repelled by it-- %$* 202
that's wrong. %$* 199
and that's why he said, you know, "god doesn't play dice with the world," because he just could not abide it. %$* 202
but i would say by and large the majority of physicists today think that einstein was probably wrong and that actually there is inherent large-- %$* 202
all right. %$* 13
one quick response and then we'll move on. %$* 13
yeah, i guess what i want to say is it's not-- %$* 199
we don't have a complete description, we do, quantum mechanics as far as we can tell is a complete description. %$* 199
we have a complete description of the probabilities. %$* 199
we know with 100 percent accuracy if you perform the experiments that were described in the paper under your name, that with a distribution, the results will occur with a different-- %$* 199
with that distribution exactly. %$* 199
and, of course, because they did, you were able to write your paper. %$* 199
so to the side-- %$* 13
excuse me-- %$* 13
to the side against the motion that "science-- %$* 13
" the motion that "science refutes god," is it your position that there are certain things that science can know and then there are certain things that science can't know, therefore, it doesn't refute god? %$* 13
but what is in this world-- %$* 13
dinesh, you talked a little bit about this universe of things that science can't handle, explain, such as why we are here-- %$* 13
that-- %$* 13
how large is that category of things that we can't know, and is science just irrelevant to that category of knowledge? %$* 13
there are some questions in which christians and religious believers are making factual claims, "god made the universe." it's a factual claim. %$* 201
either he did or he didn't. %$* 201
there is life after death. %$* 201
we may have no way to find out, but that's a factual claim, either there is or there isn't. %$* 201
"the resurrection happened," either it did or it didn't. %$* 201
now, religion also makes moral claims, "this is how you should live. %$* 201
this is a happy life," and so on, so religion operates in two domains. %$* 201
the second domain is untouchable by science. %$* 201
science can try to give accounts of how morality originated, but that's not the same thing as what you should and shouldn't do. %$* 201
well-- %$* 13
so-- %$* 201
but just be more clear about that distinction. %$* 13
well-- %$* 201
but we want to go straight to the other side about that. %$* 13
well, science can say that we evolved a desire for cooperation out of darwinian evolution, but that doesn't say if there's a famine in haiti if i should give money or no. %$* 201
so in other words the content of morality is unaffected by science although science can give an account of the origin of morality. %$* 201
but not the-- %$* 13
what is actually right or wrong. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 201
and the other thing is-- %$* 201
let me-- %$* 13
before you move on, let me go to michael shermer on that. %$* 13
well, so where do we get our morals from? %$* 200
it can't be from the bible because almost nobody obeys certainly not the old testament. %$* 200
and most of the new testament-- %$* 200
i mean, death penalty for adultery, there goes half of congress. %$* 200
i mean, nobody-- %$* 200
nobody is going to do this, right? %$* 200
so we pick and choose. %$* 200
we cherry pick from the holy book based on something else, something else that's happened that i referenced in my opening statement of there's been this other change that's happened, this secularization of morality. %$* 200
that is, you have to actually have good reasons for why you hold certain moral principles, and you should be able to articulate them. %$* 200
and so that's been the changer. %$* 200
so even if you and i both listen to the still small voice within to decide what's right or wrong, dinesh, i'm claiming you're not getting it from the bible and i'm not either, we're getting it from somewhere else. %$* 200
i think we've evolved this propensity to have moral emotions, and then culture tweaks them, and we've been getting progressively more moral. %$* 200
but how-- %$* 13
what's telling us what is actually right or wrong? %$* 13
but i think science does tell us what's right and wrong-- %$* 199
lawrence krauss speak. %$* 13
i think science does tell us what's right and wrong in a real way. %$* 199
really? %$* 13
yeah, we have learned-- %$* 199
for example, the scientific facts that certain animals can suffer, for example, affects our decision of whether-- %$* 199
of how we should treat those animals, whether we should eat them or not eat them, or the scientific evidence that certain people of certain colors don't have different intellects, different capabilities has changed the way we deal with other humans. %$* 199
but if-- %$* 13
science has determined the way we behave in the modern world. %$* 199
and science is telling us what's right or wrong. %$* 13
yeah, i think so because it's telling us how the world actually works. %$* 199
ian hutchinson. %$* 13
i don't think it's the case that it tells us right or wrong. %$* 202
i think science does often inform us in ways that help us to implement our morals and our ethics more effectively, more fairly, more accurately, and more truly. %$* 202
but in the end it cannot tell us whether it's right or wrong to do something because categories of right and wrong aren't scientific categories. %$* 202
well, the bible certainly doesn't tell us, either. %$* 199
well-- %$* 202
where do you get it from? %$* 199
yeah, where do you get it? %$* 200
i mean, does god-- %$* 200
does god speak to you and tell you? %$* 200
i'll answer that. %$* 201
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
first of all, we don't get, none of us, morality from the bible. %$* 201
it's not like i read the read the ten commandments and went, "oh, stealing is wrong, wow. %$* 201
didn't know that before. %$* 201
killing is wrong, incredible." i already knew that. %$* 201
exactly. %$* 18
how did i know it? %$* 201
i knew it because of what adam smith calls the impartial spectator, the voice of conscience. %$* 201
so it is the contention of religious believers that the voice of conscience has been implanted in us by god. %$* 201
now, you say it comes from evolution, and we say it could have been implanted in us by god through evolution. %$* 201
now, just to say that science tells us facts doesn't mean that science changes our morality. %$* 201
if i were to step on a stage and stomp on a dog, there'd be a universal wave of revulsion in the audience, although presumably the matter would be more controversial if it were a cat, but-- %$* 201
science-- %$* 201
my point is science can tell us the dog feels pain. %$* 201
but the idea that we shouldn't cause pain to others, that's a moral proposition. %$* 201
science is merely altering the fact which puts that moral principle into motion. %$* 201
so we have widened our circles of morality based upon new facts, and science can provide those, but science isn't actually telling us what's right or wrong at all. %$* 201
i want to go in a moment to you in the audience to take questions, and when we do, i just want to remind you what our format is. %$* 13
we'd like you to raise your hand, i'll call on you, a microphone will be brought to you, we really need you to wait for the microphone so the radio broadcast can hear you, and hold it about this distance, a fist distance from your mouth. %$* 13
we'd appreciate it if you could tell us your name, if you could really ask a question that's on this topic of science refuting god, and if you can be terse. %$* 13
so while we're getting set up for that, i want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: science refutes god. %$* 13
to the team that is arguing for the motion that science refutes god, i want to ask you somewhat of a personal question. %$* 13
can a scientist believe in god and still be a functioning scientist? %$* 13
absolutely, there are-- %$* 199
there are-- %$* 199
there are functioning scientists who can believe in god; there are functioning scientists who are pedophiles-- %$* 199
there are functioning scientists who are-- %$* 199
no, i'm serious, i mean, the point is scientists are human-- %$* 199
woah, woah, but that was a-- %$* 13
that was a-- %$* 13
that was a very, very, very rough grouping that you just did. %$* 13
well, in the catholic church it's not so different, but-- %$* 199
i don't know. %$* 13
i don't know in the spirit of this thing, if you want to step back from that. %$* 13
okay, but what-- %$* 199
yeah-- %$* 199
okay, but what i want to point out is that people can believe-- %$* 199
people are not fully rational. %$* 199
the point is-- %$* 199
no, i'm asking-- %$* 13
the question is, "can you be a good scientist and believe in god? %$* 13
as long as you don't take the god into the laboratory. %$* 199
as a very famous biologist said, "when i go in the laboratory, i become an atheist, because when i believe-- %$* 199
when i twiddle the knobs in my experiment, i don't believe there's some angel affecting the results of the experiment, and if i believe that in laboratory, why should i believe it outside? %$* 199
" some people choose to believe it outside; the minute they take it into the laboratory, they stop being good scientists. %$* 199
but that-- %$* 202
ian hutchinson. %$* 13
that's actually quite-- %$* 202
that's actually quite contrary to history. %$* 202
i mean, what got modern science going in the first place was a belief in the faithfulness of god, of a creator who'd made a rational creation. %$* 202
and a good case can be made that the reason why science as we know it, modern science, grew up in the west, was in part because christianity, in its philosophical and theological viewpoints, including the belief in god and god's faithfulness, served as a kind of hospitable environment in which that science could grow up. %$* 202
so it's actually not the case that the scientists of history had to say to themselves "i'm going to become an atheist when i go into the lab." many of them went into the lab precisely because they were not atheists. %$* 202
but i get the sense, though, that the other side is arguing that as science progressed, as the years went by, the more that science developed, and the more that scientists knew, the more tempting atheism became for them because of the volume and because of the discoveries, and because they found inconsistencies. %$* 13
what about that? %$* 13
do you want to take that, dinesh d'souza? %$* 13
well-- %$* 201
they learned-- %$* 13
they knew too much after a while is-- %$* 13
i think there's a presumption that science explains the material world, and science does it with material explanations-- %$* 201
just-- %$* 13
do you agree with that? %$* 13
yes or no? %$* 13
yeah. %$* 200
yes, okay. %$* 13
physical causes have physical-- %$* 199
exactly. %$* 18
okay. %$* 13
go on, dinesh. %$* 13
so it is a presumption of modern science, not a proof, but a presumption that's beyond the material world, there is nothing. %$* 201
so take, for example, the fact that as humans we experience consciousness. %$* 201
we know that there's something in us, consciousness, that can't be reduced simply to materialism. %$* 201
how do you know that? %$* 199
hold on a second. %$* 201
no, no. %$* 201
hold on a second. %$* 201
when you say, how do you know that? %$* 201
you're presuming that it is. %$* 201
do you agree that the cause of consciousness is not known? %$* 201
the fact that something is not known does not imply it's god. %$* 199
you better not get back on-- %$* 199
right. %$* 201
but neither-- %$* 201
so consciousness is an immaterial thing that may have a material explanation. %$* 201
and the keyword is "may." and yet you as a scientist believe it does. %$* 201
i don't believe anything. %$* 199
i just want to learn how the world works-- %$* 199
you just said that all causes are material. %$* 201
i'll wait for the experiments and the theory. %$* 199
ah, okay. %$* 201
so in other words, in other words, you're presuming-- %$* 201
ah. %$* 18
watch out. %$* 18
i'm simply saying, as a scientist you are closed off to the possibility of nonmaterial explanations. %$* 201
true or false? %$* 201
no. %$* 199
i told you if the stars moved around today, i'd be really thinking there's some intelligence in the universe. %$* 199
there's just never been such an observation. %$* 199
so until there is, i'll assume the reasonable logical thing, since there's never been such an observation, there's unlikely to be one. %$* 199
that's all. %$* 199
as a scientist, i can say what's likely and what's unlikely. %$* 199
i don't believe anything. %$* 199
i can say, is this likely or unlikely. %$* 199
that's all. %$* 199
dinesh. %$* 13
i think this is very important because throughout your book, you-- %$* 201
this is called ”a universe from nothing." %$* 201
can you hold it up? %$* 199
i have it right here. %$* 201
i recommend it. %$* 201
what's the name of your book? %$* 13
it's a very useful primer on the limits of science. %$* 201
here’s why. %$* 201
absolutely, the universe. %$* 199
so to quote a sample line, and there are many like this. %$* 201
you say "getting something from nothing." and then you say, "this is how our universe could have arisen." and then you say, "i stress the word could here because we may never have enough empirical information." next page you say, "these are useful operational efforts to describe how our universe might actually have originated." here's my point. %$* 201
you're invoking "coulds" and "mights" and "maybes" to provide a refutation. %$* 201
now, even if you were successful in saying that i have an alternative possibility to god, you haven't refuted god. %$* 201
you've simply given an alternative possibility. %$* 201
so you have all these qualifications in the book, but then when you step up here, you act as a science that's demonstrated that the universe did in fact come from nothing, whereas you say, it never did. %$* 201
you have not made that demonstration, and you admit it. %$* 201
i was up there, i said it was plausible. %$* 199
and plausible is remarkable because everything that's you've talked about in terms of religion is implausible. %$* 199
so the point is that just like with evolution, a simple plausible assumption appears to work is remarkable and worth celebrating. %$* 199
and so the reason i say "could" and "might" is because i'm honest. %$* 199
and also because i haven't presumed the answer before i asked the question. %$* 199
let's go to some questions from you in the audience. %$* 13
right, gentleman in the blue shirt. %$* 13
if you could state your name. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 203
my name is gerry ohrstrom. %$* 203
and my question is directed to the panelists opposing the motion. %$* 203
could you respond to michael shermer's assertion that in fact each of you are atheists 999 times over, and your adoption of christianity is merely a happenstance of the culture in which you grew up. %$* 203
and does that itself not strain the credibility of your faith itself? %$* 203
could you respond to that? %$* 203
dinesh d'souza. %$* 13
well, first of all, in my case, that is flatly untrue because i was born and raised in india. %$* 201
and the majority of religion of india is hinduism. %$* 201
the second largest faith are the muslims. %$* 201
and then you have the jains and the sikhs. %$* 201
so from a very young age, the christianity in which i was born was problematic and had to be measured against other possibilities. %$* 201
but once you begin to study the other religions, you discover something very interesting, and that is that the-- %$* 201
there are shared propositions of the different religions that point to core truths. %$* 201
one scholar described it very well. %$* 201
it's sort of like you have a mountain, and the top of the mountain, you have god. %$* 201
but no one can see him. %$* 201
and you have little rivers of knowledge pouring down. %$* 201
and some of the waterfalls may begin higher or lower. %$* 201
and you can look at the different religions of human attempts, flawed, to apprehend the same reality. %$* 201
these attempts will disagree on certain particulars, but agree on many fundamentals. %$* 201
so i don't see the other religions as wrong. %$* 201
i see all of us in the human enterprise to try to gain knowledge that seems beyond the reach of the empirical. %$* 201
ian, is your answer complementary? %$* 13
i completely agree, but i wanted to expand on it just a little bit. %$* 202
and that is to say that it's not a problem for christians that this-- %$* 202
the idea that there is a universal religious impulse-- %$* 202
which we agree on. %$* 202
i mean, there is basically a universal religious impulse in humans. %$* 202
because what christians say is, if there is a god with whom we can have a meaningful relationship, then we would expect precisely that everyone would have such a religious impulse built into them. %$* 202
and so when we look around and we see different religious view points, we recognize the universality of that. %$* 202
so i don't-- %$* 202
but you think the other religions have got it wrong? %$* 13
well, i mean "got it wrong" seems to me a rather unhelpful way to look at it. %$* 202
i mean, it's pretty direct. %$* 13
of course-- %$* 202
of course, you know, christians think that jesus was the son of god. %$* 202
but and the reason i put it that way is i think that your opponents' point and the questioner that he was bringing up is it's an accident of your birth-- %$* 13
particularly in your %$* 13
you know, it happens not to be the case for me. %$* 202
i didn't grow up in a christian family. %$* 202
so-- %$* 202
all right, michael shermer. %$* 13
just to clarify the point just briefly. %$* 200
so you just eloquently described the geography of religious beliefs of india. %$* 200
when lawrence goes to lecture in india, he doesn't discover that they do physics differently in india. %$* 200
they do physics everywhere around the world the same. %$* 200
there's just one physics. %$* 200
there's not, you know, indian physics and australian physics and so forth. %$* 200
there's just one physics. %$* 200
that's the larger point. %$* 200
you're right. %$* 202
and that's because science limits itself to asking questions of very particular type, to asking how questions rather than why questions and asking questions about the reproducible behavior of the world and so on and so forth. %$* 202
so yes, of course, science is universal, and that's one of the most attractive things about it, and that's why i'm a scientist. %$* 202
but that doesn't mean it has a grip on everything. %$* 202
but it's more than universal. %$* 199
it changes. %$* 199
and i think, you know, dinesh pointed out that-- %$* 199
lawrence %$* 13
science is wrong. %$* 199
but the fact that we changed our minds makes science-- %$* 199
gives science progress. %$* 199
different from religion. %$* 199
front row here. %$* 13
and if you could stand up, ma'am. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
my name is jane, and i'm an upper west sider. %$* 19
and i find it interesting that we have a debate here about does science refute god. %$* 19
and i-- %$* 19
my question is posed to both sides for and against the motion. %$* 19
i have yet to hear anyone really give us a clear description of what they think god is. %$* 19
we keep throwing around this term "god, god, god." %$* 19
well, this side has made clear-- %$* 13
you don't really need the question to this side, i don't think, unless i misunderstand your question. %$* 13
no, i just-- %$* 19
i'm hearing religion. %$* 19
i'm hearing religion, different religions, different beliefs. %$* 19
but i need to hear some kind of opinion or an argument for what your god is. %$* 19
how do you define your god. %$* 19
how do you define your god? %$* 19
let's do it very quickly and %$* 13
i thought i'd been pretty clear about the god that i was talking about. %$* 202
and i said that it was the god of christianity. %$* 202
and for me, the god i was talking about, for which there's no evidence, is the fact that there's intelligent, guiding purpose to the universe. %$* 199
that's a vague deism. %$* 199
the-- %$* 199
because that's the most charitable god i can imagine, that obviously the god of the major world's religions is obviously in contradiction with everything we know. %$* 199
but that's the god you're saying doesn't exist. %$* 13
that's the god i'm talking about. %$* 199
okay. %$* 13
let's move on. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
hi. %$* 18
matthew i don't have any particularly exciting qualifications of being here, i'm sorry to report. %$* 18
my question is to dinesh. %$* 18
and it relates to his point about ancient hebrews and also his latter reference that we're instilled with some form of morality. %$* 18
so on these guys, the same guys who, for example, thought that it was okay to stone a woman to death, the-- %$* 18
you know what? %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
i don't want to get into a discussion-- %$* 13
well, the point i'm trying to make is, were these the guys we should really have listened to all along in any instance? %$* 18
it's really off the topic of the clash i feel between science and god. %$* 13
i-- %$* 13
so i, with respect, want to move on to another question. %$* 13
sir. %$* 13
yeah. %$* 13
i want to address mr. %$* 18
krauss, as far as the likeliness of-- %$* 18
unlikeliness of scientific event. %$* 18
in order to say that the likeliness of universe came in from nothing without intelligent design, you have to throw out the basic laws of conservation. %$* 18
you have to imagine that the universe is infinite, at the beginning, at the very first nanosecond of creation. %$* 18
isn't it easier and isn't it more likely physically to assume that, that first particle, the mass, the matter, the energy, the intellect is the same as that mass, that energy, the matter, the intellect of the whole universe is? %$* 18
okay, let me-- %$* 199
i think i can interpret your question. %$* 199
and-- %$* 199
i need-- %$* 13
if you do-- %$* 13
try and interpret it in a way and if i-- %$* 199
can you restate it? %$* 13
and if i misrepresent it, you can tell me, but i think you're trying to say that somehow in the creation of the universe we have to violate conservation laws and we have to assume things that are unreasonable, that the creation of the universe violates the laws of nature. %$* 199
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. %$* 18
i was trying to make it sensible, but, okay. %$* 199
no, what i've just tried to say is-- %$* 18
okay, i can give you 10 more seconds to-- %$* 13
okay, all i was trying to say is in order to say that it was created from nothing, we have to violate the-- %$* 18
oh, yeah, no, and that's a-- %$* 199
it's a great question. %$* 199
it came from nothing. %$* 199
you appear to have to spout nonsense. %$* 199
but the amazing thing, the amazing thing, which is what's worth celebrating, is that we've discovered, for example, that you can have a whole universe full of 100 billion galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars and the total energy of the universe can be zero. %$* 199
and, in fact, when we go out and measure the total energy of our universe, it's consistent with zero. %$* 199
you don't have to violate anything to get something from nothing. %$* 199
and that was a surprise to scientists, but it's the case. %$* 199
and it didn't have to be the case. %$* 199
all right. %$* 13
i want to move on. %$* 13
and i want to assume again i'm not that smart a guy situation. %$* 13
i just hear we're a big zero just there. %$* 13
yeah, it's a big zero, we are. %$* 199
i don't think i like that very much. %$* 13
right in the center there, the scarf, please. %$* 13
can you explain the creation of an orchid, and, as scientists, do you believe that you will ever be in a place where you will be able to create an orchid? %$* 19
why do you feel that an orchid-- %$* 13
are you saying that an orchid needs to be a godlike creation? %$* 13
i could think-- %$* 19
you know, it's just a simple-- %$* 19
really simple question, and-- %$* 19
well, we have an-- %$* 200
we have good answers to that. %$* 200
okay. %$* 19
i mean, the evolution of flowering plants is there in coevolution with insects. %$* 200
there's a reason why orchids and other flowers look like insects, to mimic insects so that the real insects try to mate with them and move the pollen around. %$* 200
and so what we perceive as aesthetically beautiful or so on, of course, looks very different to the eyeball of an insect. %$* 200
it has a different worldview, in that sense, because evolution selected for it to do a certain thing. %$* 200
otherwise it wouldn't look that way. %$* 200
but were you you actually create-- %$* 18
i just want to-- %$* 13
were you referring to the beauty of an orchid or just the existence of an orchid? %$* 13
the existence getting at %$* 19
yeah, in fact, actually i would say-- %$* 199
lawrence krauss. %$* 13
and it's scary, and you might not like it, but the universe isn't here so you could like it, no, i mean, i know-- %$* 199
so i'm going to tell you something and i think it's likely. %$* 199
in fact, my friend, craig ventor, would create organisms by putting together the appropriate genome of those organisms. %$* 199
and i suspect for better-- %$* 199
hold on-- %$* 199
for better-- %$* 199
for better or worse we'll be able to put together molecule by molecule the genome of something that will reproduce and produce an orchid. %$* 199
we'll have life where there wasn't life before. %$* 199
that is scary, and you might-- %$* 199
and we have to understand what we're doing when we're not yet capable of doing that, but we will be one day, and unless we accept that possibility we won't be able to as a society determine what constraints we should put on ourselves so we have a sense of a policy. %$* 199
but we will do it. %$* 199
need some morality on that one. %$* 13
i want to move on. %$* 13
right down in front here. %$* 13
i'm sorry, would you mind standing up? %$* 13
oh. %$* 19
thanks. %$* 13

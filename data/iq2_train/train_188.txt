we know who the real enemies are. %$* 507
i don’t need to remind people, in this city certainly, who real enemies of the united states are. %$* 507
in my view we can’t afford to shift our focus from our real enemies to our imagined ones. %$* 507
in sum, once again, russia may very well be its own worst enemy, but that does not make it our enemy. %$* 507
thank you very much. %$* 507
one minute. %$* 106
in sum, once again, russia may very well be its own worst enemy, but that does not make it our enemy. %$* 507
thank you very much. %$* 507
well, thank you very much indeed, mark medish. %$* 106
and i would hate to think that the legendary reticence and shyness of the new yorkers was going to prevail even on this occasion, so do, please, make yourselves known to the ushers, the ladies on the left and on the right have cards, you can fill ‘em in, make points, you don’t need to give your name if you don’t want to, i will find you just by the item of clothing which you like to be identified by. %$* 106
um, if you’re from the press however we would like you to make your, um, to just identify yourself as from the press. %$* 106
and we’re very keen to have audience participation here and be interactive. %$* 106
now, um, we can now resul—um, announce, the results of the, um, vote that you, um, cast at the beginning of the evening. %$* 106
and it’s this. %$* 106
for the motion, 41 percent. %$* 106
against the motion, 23 percent. %$* 106
and undecided, 36 percent. %$* 106
so there’s everything to play for, it could go either way by the end. %$* 106
if you’ve made your mind up, may—if you’ve made your mind up once already you can already make it up again, as the, uh, as the discussion continues. %$* 106
but i’d like now just to come back to the panel and, and see if we can get a bit of discussion going here and i’d like first of all to ask bret stephens to come back on the point that robert legvold made, about how this is just russia wanting to be heard, this is, russia is no longer on its knees, it’s an economically successful country with a popular president, with its own view of how things should be in the world. %$* 106
and feeling that it really has the right to make itself heard and to have that, um, that view taken seriously, so, bret stephens, don’t you think there’s, there’s something in that? %$* 106
all countries have the right to make themselves heard, the french make themselves heard very, very vocally and often very effectively. %$* 141
um, uh, the same goes, it’s a, it’s an ordinary fact of international political life. %$* 141
but if you are, say, the president of a struggling young democracy called georgia, and it is the middle of winter, and you find that there have been two simultaneous gas epxlo—uh, pipeline explosions, that are piping in, uh, gasoline supplies, uh, to your country on, on christmas eve, that is a very different way of making yourself heard. %$* 141
the same happens, of course, if you, if you are viktor yushchenko, and you are campaigning for the presidency of an independent country called ukraine, which nonetheless, vladimir putin and his, uh, friends in the ukraine still consider a tr—satrap of the, uh, of russia or excuse me, um, what they, uh, wish, uh, still was the soviet union. %$* 141
and so, the way you go about dealing with mr. %$* 141
yushchenko, is by, um, administering a nearly lethal, uh, dose of dioxin, that is a very different way of making yourself heard. %$* 141
if you are the poles and you are trying to export simply meat products to russia and they, and they will not, um, and they will not allow it on rankly mercantilist grounds, that is again a very different way of making yourself heard, and it is our contention, on this side— we are not interested in making russia another enemy, we wish %$* 141
with all respect to the psychoanal— analysis on the other side, we— as, as they— as mark rightly pointed out, we have common, we ought to have common interests. %$* 141
we really do have a common enemy in islamic extremism. %$* 141
but facts are facts, and when russia or rather, this russian government, makes itself heard, it makes itself heard by bullying, by violence and by intimidation. %$* 141
um, robert legvold, do you think that answers your point that this is not just russia making itself heard, it’s breaking the rules and doing things in an extreme and damaging way that disrupts the neighborhood and that must be something the united states has to, uh, try and counter. %$* 106
i think that’s right, as my, the argument i’m making is not that russian behavior is admirable in all respects and doesn’t pose a problem. %$* 504
but i am saying that the major motivation for doing this kind of thing is as i described it, and often, i think we overlook that dimension of it. %$* 504
my problem with the argument that’s being made by the other side right now is the risk of oversimplification. %$* 504
the monochromatic picture that’s being presented, which, in its characterization of russia, carries a very high risk of generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the first instance, and secondly, that is almost certainly going to be, uh, would, would recommend behavior on our part, that would be contrary to our national interests because of the stakes we have in being able to cooperate with russia if we can move in that direction. %$* 504
even in terms of moving russia domestically. %$* 504
one of the, one of the questions that we need to ask the other side in the course of the evening, what do they wanna do about it. %$* 504
and what they wanna do about it, well begin telling you what the risks are of acting on their characterization of russia, as they present it. %$* 504
which is vastly oversimplified. %$* 504
there’s nobody in this room that wants to as mark said defend what’s happening in russia. %$* 504
not only is it disturbing to us, there are a number of things that have happened that are utterly reprehensible. %$* 504
but it’s not only a black and white story. %$* 504
i was witness to a conversation between steve hadley, who is our national security advisor, uh, the principle advisor to president bush, and vladimir lukin, who is the ombudsman for human rights in the soviet union, a position that’s appointed by the duma. %$* 504
hadley’s point was %$* 504
in russia, i’m sorry. %$* 504
uh, hadley’s point was that we wish well, we believe that democracy and building democracy’s very i mean in russia, and as a part of that a free press is crucial, and we are very disturbed over the murder of anna, anna politkovskaya. %$* 504
uh, and we— and it was clear that hadley wanted a message carried back to moscow on this story. %$* 504
lukin’s response was very measured and very careful, he said we are deeply concerned about it as well in the ombudsman’s office. %$* 504
as i said this is an official, he’s appointed by the duma. %$* 504
he said that, there are— there is an investment underway, he said we’re concerned because, not only anna stepanova but also two other editors from novaya gazyeta her newspaper, have been destroyed along the way. %$* 504
the investment is very important to us, and he said the important thing is that at this stage the editors of novaya gazyeta which is one of the more open and critical newspapers, are satisfied with the way in which this—this process is proceeding. %$* 504
and then he finished by saying that each year the ombudsman’s office for human rights makes four awards for advancing human rights in russia, and this year the ombudsman’s office made that award to anna stepanova, and to novaya gazyeta. %$* 504
now, that’s not to deny all the other things that are very true. %$* 504
the crackdown on the ngo’s, the closing down particularly of electronic media. %$* 504
the unwillingness now to cooperate with the osce moving into the elections. %$* 504
maybe even the suspicion that officials at the—at a senior level were involved with the murder of litvinenko. %$* 504
but that’s still not a proven point, i mean, lugovoy may be the murderer, but we don’t know that it traces directly to putin. %$* 504
and there are a series of these accusations that are being made tonight, that are simply too monochromatic. %$* 504
well robert legvold, let me— %$* 106
black and white— %$* 504
—just take—you made a very interesting point, what would the other side like to do about it, let me put that to claudia rosett, okay, imagine you were secretary of state or national security advisor in some future administration, what would you be tell— or even president. %$* 106
what would you be, what, what policy would you be advocating, what should we be doing. %$* 106
well, with due respect, i think the motion tonight is not what we should do %$* 503
about the fact that russia is becoming our enemy again, but is it becoming our enemy again. %$* 503
and, uh, so, i’m actually not going to suggest a policy in reaction tonight, but, i would like to just mention that, from the opposing side, and, again i stress, i wish they were right, but i urge you to %$* 503
look at what we are presenting, and vote that they are not. %$* 503
um, we’ve heard about, and i’m quoting here, “the cool peace.” “the challenge.” “the heightened challenge.” uh, and we’ve also heard the saudis described as a %$* 503
good example of %$* 503
a country that—with which we may have disagreements but they are not our enemy. %$* 503
that might be a good subject for a future debate. %$* 503
uh— and, i would suggest that, what we’re %$* 503
actually listening to here is, uh %$* 503
the difficulty of figuring out what to do about the fact that, yes indeed, russia is becoming our enemy again. %$* 503
thanks very much, claudia rosett, and i know mr. %$* 106
rosenkranz is in the audience and i’m sure he’ll bear that in mind when he’s planning the next, uh, next schedule for debates. %$* 106
but i think it’s time to take a—take a question from the audience, and i’m going to, um, go for the right-hand aisle. %$* 106
um, mr. %$* 106
barry wade, if you’d like to identify yourself, um, i believe you’re wearing—yeah, down at the front here. %$* 106
and, uh, you’re wearing a red tie and you’ve put that on your card and that’s very good so i can see you, and a microphone is making its way to you right now, so please, sir, state your question. %$* 106
as i understand some remarks that garry kasparov has made recently on his book tour in the united states, uh, he charges putin with, essentially devoting his administration to the support of oil prices, and creating turmoil throughout the world, for the specific purpose of increasing oil prices, essentially so that he and his friends can pocket the money. %$* 508
that it’s really about the money, it’s not about geopolitics. %$* 508
my question is, is kasparov correct and if so what does that say about tonight’s proposition. %$* 508
that’s an excellent question, i’m gonna give it first of all to nina khruschcheva. %$* 106
what do you think about, uh, garry kasparov’s analysis of what’s happening. %$* 106
um, well, garry kasparov is %$* 505
speaking and very popular in the west, he is very much, uh, called for, his opinions are called for. %$* 505
um, not so much in russia and in fact i must say that for a lot of russian observers, in fact, uh %$* 505
garry kasparov often becomes a nuisance because he also simplifies the real problem that russia faces and, uh, uh, takes away attention from, um, detailed policies that, that could be, uh, presented and, um %$* 505
and designed. %$* 505
as for this assumption, i have to say i sort of agree with them, that, uh, putin’s russia is quite a bit about money, i mean, khodorkovsky’s story, mikhail khodorkovsky’s story, as the russian saying goes, they broke the yukos company just to give putin, um, um %$* 505
the, the dowry for his daughters. %$* 505
uh, so that’s—i mean it’s, it’s oversimplification probably but the money certainly is a huge, huge, uh, huge part of, of, uh, the putin story. %$* 505
however, it’s not exactly part of that. %$* 505
because, um, putin also, uh, tries to establish the russian ideology, as—well not the russian ideology, sort of reestablish the, um, the, um, greatness of the russian state, and i think that he’s very much preoccupied with. %$* 505
and he—he believes that the state needs money to do that so i’m not quite sure that, uh, all the kasparov’s assumption that it all goes to him personally is quite correct, i think they do put it, uh, to, uh, to work into sort of creating, uh, the state strength. %$* 505
so, um, as, uh, my, um %$* 505
colleague suggested, in discussing russia we need not to, uh, look at black and white and, and, uh, and simplification but really see it, um, see what kind of real policies are happening and, uh, exactly what, what’s behind those decisions and policies. %$* 505
well nina khruschcheva, thank you very much for that, let me put that point then to, um, michael waller, you’ve written extensively about corruption at the highest levels in russia, and if it really is, um, just a front for corruption, all this xenophobic and imperialist rhetoric, then, isn’t in a way that— make— doesn’t that make it impossible for russia to be our, our enemy because they’re only really interested in self-enrichment. %$* 106
well %$* 506
we can buy them off. %$* 106
well, we really—with oil prices it’s like kinda hard to find a—a better way to buy them, we certainly don’t have any influence with them with our loans anymore with the imf. but with the, uh %$* 506
in—in fact it was, uh, boris fyodorov the early finance minister in the democratic russian government who waned us that, uh, don’t loan us a billion dollars from the imf because that’s, that’s not enough to help us and it’s too much to fuel corruption. %$* 506
but when you look at putin’s background where he was in st. %$* 506
petersburg as a kgb guy handling foreign currency transactions, hard-currency transactions with no checks and balances, his, his qualifications were that he was a liaison officer to the east german stasi, for several years. %$* 506
in fact that was his nickname in st. %$* 506
petersburg, stasi. %$* 506
so, so you have a—so, so stasi comes to, to moscow to run the presidential property administration. %$* 506
the, the notoriously honest boris yeltsin administration’s property-management system, where his daughter also had great, uh, economic interests at stake. %$* 506
so here, he, he, he’s the money-mover, he’s the money-hider, he’s the one with the kgb contacts to, to, networks to, make sure everything can be done quietly, and efficiently. %$* 506
uh, but at the same time, he’s a patriot, he does love his country. %$* 506
and you can have crooked patriots. %$* 506
and so, so, he’s using oil revenues and gas revenues to finance a huge military, uh, uh, modernization program that’s a—not a reform, not to reform the military ‘cause they still have their beatings of their troops and all of this other nonsense but it’s to modernize with force projection and with weapons of mass destruction. %$* 506
um, using that currency for that, for infrastructure development, and for other things that will ensure that he and his people are kept in power, they cannot leave power because if they do leave power they’ll be arrested or—or worse, because of the crimes they’ve committed. %$* 506
so, so, so you have sort of a, a, uh, a, uh, a, a mobutu-type system here, uh, only russian-style, uh, where you have a more— much more efficient administration than mobutu ever had but unlike mobutu, uh, putin’s not looting everything. %$* 506
he’s leaving a lot, for the russia public, for the pension system and for others so that he gets a perm—permanent support base probably for the rest of his life. %$* 506
edward, let me— %$* 504
yes, do— %$* 106
—respond to something that— %$* 504
—do, do, do come—robert legvold, do come, do come back on that. %$* 106
uh, respond to what michael’s just been saying, one of the phrases he uses, “this enormous military modernization.” military modernization within russia. %$* 504
you know what the russian military budget is this year? %$* 504
it’s $31 billion. %$* 504
you know what our military budget is, $430 billion. %$* 504
our military budget is half the gdp of russia, at this point. %$* 504
secondly, he talked about the modernization of strategic forces including this nuclear submarine, which is be—behind schedule, it’s only one, and serious analysts on the russian side that know this and are very critical of foreign policy in the putin regime, like general dvorkin, and alexei arbatov, are very concerned about a different kind of a problem because if we really do move in this direction where we are adversaries and we do begin again, engaging the nuclear contest, then somewhere around 2015, russia because of the attrition of its forces, its weakening of its strategic forces, will be forced to what is called a launch on warning policy which is very destabilizing, it’s the part of the world that we’ve forgotten about. %$* 504
as we concentrate on these other problems, in addressing that, we have to deal with the russians. %$* 504
we are together still 90 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world when we talk about the nuclear haves, we need the russians, not just in energy, not just in dealing with issues of regional instability and nuclear nonproliferation, or weapons of mass destruction. %$* 504
but indeed of working this problem of stability within the eurasian heartland. %$* 504
what they’re talking about in terms of the tension in russia’s relations with georgia or the things that the russians are doing with ukraine, they’re quite right. %$* 504
that really is a threat. %$* 504
we need to work that problem. %$* 504
how are we gonna work the problem, claudia says, we don’t have to talk about what the implications are of this. %$* 504
i’m saying, everything matters because the way you phrase this problem is not cost-free. %$* 504
let me just straight back to michael waller, the russian military is very weak and we’d be safer if they had more nukes. %$* 106
that’s sort—yeah. %$* 506
well, and they’re spending their money in the, the, the nuclear weapons program with the topol- m ss-27 icbm, they, they boast that it can break through our missile defense systems yet they complain about how dangerous our missile defense system is. %$* 506
it doesn’t matter whether their submarine has had problems or it’s over schedule, they’ve laid the keels for two more of them. %$* 506
and the current one is at sea trials now and it is a very advanced piece of equipment and it’s a revolutionary design so it’s going to have problems. %$* 506
we can’t pooh-pooh these things. %$* 506
we can’t pretend they don’t exist. %$* 506
they—the, the projected military budget is to build a new strategic, long-range nuclear bomber, and long-range nuclear cruise missiles to go aboard those bombers. %$* 506
we can’t pretend these things away. %$* 506
this shows, this shows intent of the russian political and military leadership, and it’s something that we’re going to have to grapple with, we can’t call them friends for behaving this way. %$* 506
but let’s—on the subject of missiles there’s an excellent question from the audience, last row, left side, marvin d.resnick. %$* 106
if you’d like to identify yourself, um %$* 106
i see a hand, it’s right up at the back there, if you can, uh %$* 106
ushers are sprinting towards you with microphones. %$* 106
both of them at once, it’ll be interesting who gets there first. %$* 106
um, but, um %$* 106
marvin resnick, the, um, please, please, give us your question. %$* 106
do—do you ask me to repeat the question? %$* 509
um, yes, would you—i mean i can say it for you but i thought you might like to say it yourself— %$* 106
oh, okay. %$* 509
oh, that when we, uh, when we had détente, and, uh, the russians, uh, withdrew militarily, we kept our missiles in europe, ostensibly, to be directed at the middle east supposedly. %$* 509
and i’m wondering if that didn’t %$* 509
turn putin, into a cynic who said well i can’t trust the united states if they’re gonna keep their missiles there, and that—that set him off on a, uh, shall i say, a right-wing course. %$* 509
right. %$* 106
well i think it’s very interesting in this context to look at the american missile defense bases in, um, which are planned for poland and the czech republic and have been very controversial there, so let’s wrap that together, let me put that to claudia rosett, do you think that, um, if—how, how justified is putin in seeing after-nato expansion when he was promised, russia was promised that there’d be no nato, big nat—nato bases in the former warsaw pact countries and now here we are building two quite important ones. %$* 106
aren’t the russians justified in feeling a little bit antsy about this, a little bit par— paranoid? %$* 106
i think that from the russian point of view if anything it’s one more convenient excuse. %$* 503
i mean the, the—could we back up here for a minute. %$* 503
when %$* 503
the russian government came in, building on the debris of the soviet union, and in many ways it is the same russia %$* 503
in fact the basic framework for many things, is the same russia. %$* 503
um, they had an enormous challenge ahead where the great hope was that they would build a genuine democratic state, and that required great concentration on internal reforms. %$* 503
and more and more, what we’ve been listening to, is a focus on external enemies. %$* 503
on ways of avoiding that kind of %$* 503
of actually dealing inside. %$* 503
what you got instead, was this criminal state, which, is going to basically take anything that’s convenient and use it for a sort of rallying point. %$* 503
so, should he be concerned? %$* 503
we’re not about to attack russia. %$* 503
um, and i don’t think that we’re arguing here this evening that russia is about to physically attack the united states, we’re not worried that with their military budget they’re going to launch missiles that will hit new york next week. %$* 503
uh, what we’re worried about, is that they have become a force that is antagonistic, or they are becoming increasingly antagonistic to our interests, and, could i just suggest that this is not only military. %$* 503
on the diplomatic front, if you follow the united nations, russia is over and over again at loggerheads with everything that is in the us interests, uh, both in the debate that’s gone on in iran, uh, in the effort to enforce sanctions on iraq they were the number-one cheaters. %$* 503
uh, have done nothing about that, there’s been no investment, nothing, well, we have federal prosecutions here into people who did dirty deals. %$* 503
um, and, if you go to things like the human rights council, you will find russia and its votes lining up squarely with countries that i think you can reasonably call enemies of the united states, if you would accept, you know %$* 503
countries like %$* 503
uh, let’s see, i’m thinking on the human rights council %$* 503
we get into saudi arabia again, but in the votes at the un— forgive me, i need to parse out the councils, at—with more time. %$* 503
but, they line up with iran, with cuba, with sudan, with syria, with countries that are very much opposed to the us interests, it’s that kind of, growing %$* 503
sort of, that trend— %$* 503
right— %$* 106
—that we’re talking about tonight. %$* 503
mark medish, um, against the motion, do you wanna come back on that? %$* 106
i would, i’d like to go back to the gist of the question because i think it, it, it really brings up an important point, that, that again if we were sitting in moscow, we would hear from, from people there a long bill of particulars about how they feel that russia has been slighted, in, in the post-cold war period. %$* 507
uh, how the us, uh, uh, advanced its interests, in an unconsultative manner, uh, um, against russia’s interests, and you named one area, uh, of, of the forward basing of missiles, the nato enlargement which the us had, had actually promised to rule out, uh, during the process of german unification but that, that went forward. %$* 507
i think it’s good that it did but it irritated the russians. %$* 507
uh, the unilateral abrogation of the abm treaty, by the bush administration in its first months in office. %$* 507
that angered the russians, it annoyed them, the unilateralism of it in particular. %$* 507
the fact that promises have been made about the lifting of the jackson-vanek amendment. %$* 507
promises not kept. %$* 507
so there’s a long list on that side as well. %$* 507
we have a list. %$* 507
we need to cut through this. %$* 507
we need to cut through this, because these %$* 507
bills of particulars, don’t actually add up to a hostile enemy relationship. %$* 507
we need to bear in mind, in america, that other countries are allowed to have national security interests as well. %$* 507
and they’re allowed to interpret those themselves. %$* 507
and they won’t always line up perfectly. %$* 507
there’ll be friction. %$* 507
and we’ve gotta work out issues, that are at the, at the, uh, uh, tension points. %$* 507
well let me just follow up on that with another question to the people opposing the motion. %$* 106
um, that there’s—i think a consensus here that the mood in russia is quite anti-western and a lot of the, um, propaganda or, or stands taken by the, um, the media in russia stokes this up, we heard about textbooks, it’s, it’s in the media as well. %$* 106
um, i’d like to ask nina khrushcheva, um, who’s, uh, speaking against the motion— isn’t there a danger that people actually start believing this, even if this anti-western propaganda that paints, paints america and the west as, as russia’s enemy, even if it doesn’t, um, take effect right now when the problem is still, um, dealable with, it’s surely only a matter of time before that propaganda starts taking effect and, and we’ll—they’ll, they’ll get what they wish for. %$* 106
absolutely, there is always a danger with propaganda, uh, it could be successful or unsuccessful and putin’s propaganda is incredibly successful because as you know, not only that he has tough stands on, on, uh %$* 505
uh, on america, sometimes, on, um %$* 505
international debate, but he also walks around half-naked in siberia, showing off his abs, i mean and this is the most successful propaganda you can have, all of a sudden russia has a president that is better than james bond. %$* 505
i mean that’s, uh, that is a very powerful, powerful, uh, message, and in fact, i think this message is, is also created because, um, as i think, uh, bob mentioned, uh, the military exercises threatening as they may look, in fact they’re not really going that well, and we also know that russia’s, um, uh, russia’s technology or at least implementation of, of, uh, service, uh, is no longer what it was during the, the soviet period when the training was, was good, in fact excellent, now it’s sort of all over the place so they may come up with some latest technology but they have no idea how to service it, i mean, you know, let’s face it, even kgb now has the third-rate people there, so there is a certain danger that it could happen. %$* 505
but, you know, i’m the only russian here so i can speak from experience. %$* 505
um, uh, russians are only gullible to a certain extent. %$* 505
and, uh, when they really realize, because so far the words actually kind of correspond, whatever they wanna believe, but, the minute it stops happening, i can assure you, dissidentship will come back as it was in the ‘50s and ‘60s or what we’ve never seen before. %$* 505
thanks khrushcheva, very briefly, bret stephens, you come back on in, on, on, on that— %$* 106
on a, on a couple of points, first of all to nina’s point, um, incompetence is not intention. %$* 141
if the russians are building brand-new nuclear missile submarines which is, um, a, uh, i would say a bizarre project given the shambles of their regular forces and, uh, what their needs are, the fact that they’re not building them well or the sea trials aren’t going well, uh, doesn’t address the basic point which is that this is what they intend to do. %$* 141
so that’s, that’s a point that needs, uh, to be, uh, made. %$* 141
i wanna, um, get back to something that mark said as well. %$* 141
um, which seems %$* 141
first of all, i, i’m, i’m delighted, that we have found finally a bipartisan moment where a former clinton administration official is handsomely praising the diplomacy of, of, um, of, uh, the successors, and, and i find this one of the ironies of this conversation. %$* 141
um, but this comes from a kind of school of, what, what mark said comes from a kind of school that this is all big un— misunderstanding we have with the russians. %$* 141
they have one view of the world, we have a different view of the world. %$* 141
we need a kind of therapy session to work through, uh, um, these kinds of misunderstandings and while that is true, uh, in some ways, i don’t think it can really account, um, either for russian behavior, or, as michael said, um, the efforts by two if not three american administrations to bend over backwards for, uh, um, to—and make excuses for the putin government, in fact one of the great complaints i hear when russian, uh, usually dissident figures come through our offices at the wall street journal, they will say, why is your president constantly %$* 141
forgiving, acquiescing, making excuses, for, um, uh, for vladimir putin. %$* 141
there—there’s one other point i’d like to make if i can—if i— %$* 141
15 seconds if you can squeeze it in. %$* 106
well, it’s, it’s an issue that someone here needs to address, which is, uh, yes, the united states and russia, um, ought to have common interests, and yet strangely the russians seem to work at cross-purposes with what we would say at this table are their basic interests. %$* 141
why are they building a nuclear reactor at bushehr, which mr. %$* 141
putin just said he is ready to complete, which in a period of about 15 months, will create 330 kilograms of spent fuel, which can easily be reprocessed into about 50 to 60 nagasaki-type bombs, is that the russia interest? %$* 141
right, well we now move on to the final, um, uh, part of the, the debate, where the, um, members of the panel will be able to come back and make final points, i could see mark medish was itching to come in there on michael waller but you will have a chance in your peroration to, um %$* 106
uh, to respond to him. %$* 106
so, we are going to go in reverse order, so the first, um, uh, person to, to conclude, um, from the side against the motion, that russia is not becoming our enemy, is robert legvold. %$* 106
robert. %$* 106
this is a country with an enormous number of major foreign policy problems, and the next administration republican or democrat are going to have to—is going to have to review the whole gamut of us foreign policy, not just struggle with this problem of the iraq war. %$* 504
i think the last thing that we wanna do at this point, what we do wanna do is reduce the number of problems, we don’t want needlessly to add problems. %$* 504
as i’ve said, phrasing the issue as though russia is becoming the enemy, which has implications for action, is not cost-free. %$* 504
and at a time when we have so many issues where cooperation with russia is important, and it’s not absent, we’re getting it in a number of important respects— it’s—it is the struggle on global terrorism, there is still essentially a cooperative relationship in dealing with that problem. %$* 504
in addressing the questions of islamic extremism, there is still essential cooperation in that area. %$* 504
and in terms of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, including the north korean issue, there is still cooperation between our two sides. %$* 504
but addition on other issues like, the relationship among— %$* 504
one minute— %$* 106
—the nuclear powers, the problem of weaponization of space, that most of us are not focused on, the problem of lowering the nuclear threshold and making nuclear weapons usable, bunker- busters on our side, incorporating nuclear weapons into conventional doctrine on the russian side %$* 504
when 90 percent of the weapons are held by these two countries, russia’s absolutely essential. %$* 504
now, if we are going to make any kind of progress, it doesn’t mean that we whitewash russia or that we put our head in the sand or that we ignore all of the issues that the other side has raised so well about the reprehensible trends within russia. %$* 504
but we’re still then left with the question of how we address those isshens effectively. %$* 504
not in ways that give us emotional satisfaction. %$* 504
but in ways in which we can make some progress. %$* 504
the experience i have, is that if it’s done carefully and with certain segments within russia including some that are fairly close to official circles, you can have a conversation about all of the issues that they raised. %$* 504
this is a country with an enormous number of major foreign policy problems, and the next administration republican or democrat are going to have to—is going to have to review the whole gamut of us foreign policy, not just struggle with this problem of the iraq war. %$* 504
i think the last thing that we wanna do at this point, what we do wanna do is reduce the number of problems, we don’t want needlessly to add problems. %$* 504
as i’ve said, phrasing the issue as though russia is becoming the enemy, which has implications for action, is not cost-free. %$* 504
and at a time when we have so many issues where cooperation with russia is important, and it’s not absent, we’re getting it in a number of important respects— it’s—it is the struggle on global terrorism, there is still essentially a cooperative relationship in dealing with that problem. %$* 504
in addressing the questions of islamic extremism, there is still essential cooperation in that area. %$* 504
and in terms of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, including the north korean issue, there is still cooperation between our two sides. %$* 504
but addition on other issues like, the relationship among— %$* 504
thanks very much— %$* 106
and indeed the russians are the ones that are raising these issues themselves as their critics inside— %$* 504
robert leg— robert legvold, your time’s up, thank you very much. %$* 106
now, uh, for the motion, claudia rosett. %$* 106
thank you. %$* 503
um, i think, um, we are not debating here whether russia is the enemy or becoming the enemy. %$* 503
we’re discussing whether it is becoming our enemy %$* 503
it is possible for the united states to have more than one. %$* 503
in fact to have several. %$* 503
um, and, uh, in trying to frame what we’re actually talking about, um, the issue actually isn’t what we’d do about it. %$* 503
that is a very important issue, it’s one worth debating and i once heard somebody say, well the first thing that we need to do is start by telling them what we need. %$* 503
the thing that we rather neglected to do in the 1990s. %$* 503
we were so busy worrying about what russia needed, that we neglected to say, we as america need the following things. %$* 503
um, uh, there have been a lot of points raised here, the one i’d most like to just %$* 503
refute is, that we are cooperating in islamic extremism. %$* 503
i would class in islamic extremism the activities of iran. %$* 503
a genuine terrorist-sponsoring state, i think there’s no doubt about that. %$* 503
and on that russia along with china has been one of the main stumbling blocks in american efforts to actually stop that nuclear program. %$* 503
uh, in the larger picture, is russia becoming our enemy, we can discuss many ways in which russia’s aggrieved, challenged, needs validation, peeved, upset and so on. %$* 503
but, we’ve heard here a list of things going badly wrong inside russia itself. %$* 503
what we’ve heard effectively is there is no real check on what is happening with the power that now accrues to the kremlin. %$* 503
and, the agenda that will follow is one where we’ve heard a list, as bret gave you, of the kinds of things that come from that. %$* 503
they are dangerous, they are inimical to the kind of values this country stands for. %$* 503
and in some things they’ve been downright confrontational, singling out the us.i wanna tell you just a quick anecdote. %$* 503
a wonderful— %$* 503
in eight seconds, please. %$* 106
an editor of mine once explained, the difficulty with defining insider trading. %$* 503
he said it’s a very blurry line, when you really start parsing the cases, but if you find yourself walking around with suitcases full of cash, making calls from pay phones, you can have crossed that line. %$* 503
and— %$* 503
claudia rosett, your time is up— %$* 106
—with enemy, may i just suggest that when you find yourself running a geiger counter over the teapot, and trying to defend obvious interests of the free world— %$* 503
you’ve made your point. %$* 106
it’s— %$* 106
thank you. %$* 503
uh—to the, to the people who are watching, uh, who are listening, um, on the podcast or on the radio at this point, uh, claudia rosett pointed at the blue teapot. %$* 106
nina khrushcheva against the motion. %$* 106
thank you, um, i would like to go back to what our side keeps arguing is that, um, what is the policy, what is to be done, because obviously, um, russia is a difficult %$* 505
case to defend today. %$* 505
so when i was thinking how i would ret up wrap up, um, provided that there would be some, there would be no surprises, and i started looking for, um, some great american or great british diplomats, because they seem to have, uh, really a lot of say about the soviet union at the time. %$* 505
people like george kennan and isaiah berlin, and actually, uh, please forgive me, would like to quote from isaiah berlin, who was a russian empire born british diplomat, political philosopher and historian of ideas. %$* 505
and this is a short piece, 1946 written, why the soviet union chooses to insulate itself. %$* 505
and here is the quote. %$* 505
it is necessary to remember that the russians do not believe a word we say, because they think they understand us more clearly than we do ourselves. %$* 505
true or not, it has been centuries long convention that the west is to get them. %$* 505
the only way to convince them is the british, and we can say the west, or the united states today, mean no harm, is simply by not meaning any, they will always judge behavior by deeds and not words. %$* 505
if we follow an undeviating policy with whatever we believe right for its end, making concessions where possible, but not letting the end out of sight, and if treat the russians as any other great power, despite their odd non-reciprocal behavior, and do not answer back despite, despite their intolerable provocation, but firmly contrive to work for whatever seems in our and the world’s crucial interest, then we may hope for success. %$* 505
otherwise, the wrangle of policies will become an ideological, ultimately armed conflict, and end war, when principles equally unacceptable to liberal persons. %$* 505
thank you. %$* 505
nina khrushcheva, and isaiah berlin, thank you very much. %$* 106
and uh, bret stephens, for the notion. %$* 106
uh, none of us on this side wish to see russia, um, as an enemy again. %$* 141
we are not looking for another enemy. %$* 141
we have enemies enough in places like afghanistan, pakistan, iran, and iraq. %$* 141
the battle against islamic militancy and radicalism is one that we would do, we would do better to fight alongside russia, not at cross purposes with it. %$* 141
we also don’t want to needlessly antagonize russia with rhetorical excesses. %$* 141
but as vaclav havel said, told me when i interviewed him in june, with me, “ras- putin,” as he called him, becomes more and more suspicious. %$* 141
we have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior. %$* 141
mr. %$* 141
havel has a philosophy about that, it’s called living in truth. %$* 141
so let’s tell mr. %$* 141
putin the truth, let’s tell ourselves the truth, the truth. %$* 141
we worry about the political trends within russia, not just because we are friends of democracy, human rights, freedom, the rule of law, but because the respect the governments have for their own people tend to correlate with their attitude and behavior vis-à-vis— %$* 141
one minute. %$* 106
the outside world. %$* 141
we worry about russian behavior toward countries like ukraine, estonia, and georgia, because we fear that that behavior is a harbinger for what’s in store for europe and the united states. %$* 141
and we look on the trends in russia, in russian attitudes towards journalists, human rights groups, foreign investors, neighbors, toward their own history, and finally towards us with growing alarm. %$* 141
and the direction seems clear and unrelenting, and it leads us to conclude that russia is on its way toward again becoming an enemy of the united states, and we won't be able to do anything to change that until we come to terms with the reality that we are facing. %$* 141
thank you. %$* 141
uh, none of us on this side wish to see russia, um, as an enemy again. %$* 141
we are not looking for another enemy. %$* 141
we have enemies enough in places like afghanistan, pakistan, iran, and iraq. %$* 141
the battle against islamic militancy and radicalism is one that we would do, we would do better to fight alongside russia, not at cross purposes with it. %$* 141
we also don’t want to needlessly antagonize russia with rhetorical excesses. %$* 141
but as vaclav havel said, told me when i interviewed him in june, with me, “ras- putin,” as he called him, becomes more and more suspicious. %$* 141
we have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior. %$* 141
mr. %$* 141
havel has a philosophy about that, it’s called living in truth. %$* 141
so let’s tell mr. %$* 141
putin the truth, let’s tell ourselves the truth, the truth. %$* 141
we worry about the political trends within russia, not just because we are friends of democracy, human rights, freedom, the rule of law, but because the respect the governments have for their own people tend to correlate with their attitude and behavior vis-à-vis— %$* 141
bret stephens, thanks very much. %$* 106
mark medish? %$* 106
there is no irony in my praise for, uh, the work of, of the present administration. %$* 507
i come from a strong bipartisan tradition in us financial policy, and i, i wish the wall street journal editorial board would rediscover that part of the american heritage. %$* 507
on iran policy, uh, i just wanted to mention that russia and israel have both reaffirmed many times that they view each other as strategic allies. %$* 507
after putin’s visit to tehran recently, he met with ehud olmert in moscow, and the same statements and reassurances were made. %$* 507
and that, that gives me confidence, uh, that the russians are not, are not beyond the pale on this issue, uh, but, but may in fact be part of the solution ultimately. %$* 507
it’s a very difficult problem. %$* 507
once again, i urge you to reject this notion, rejecting it is not to defend russia, and it’s not to defend mr. %$* 507
putin’s track record. %$* 507
the motion should be rejected because— %$* 507
one minute. %$* 106
of core us national security interests. %$* 507
this is a question about core interests, not about metaphors or metaphysics. %$* 507
the proposition is wrong on its face. %$* 507
russia could not be our enemy again, it, this russia has never been our enemy. %$* 507
we also should avoid manicheanism in our financial policy. %$* 507
we have enough real enemies, let’s not imagine new ones. %$* 507
like china, russia is a very difficult counterpart and partner. %$* 507
it’s not our enemy. %$* 507
russia may be its own worst enemy, but that does not mean it’s becoming ours. %$* 507
i urge you to reject the notion. %$* 507
thank you. %$* 507
mark medish, thank you very much. %$* 106
and finally, michael waller. %$* 106
thank you. %$* 506
not even al qaeda is building a nuclear missile system that can wipe out our entire country. %$* 506
and we, some of us want to turn a blind eye to those who are doing just that program, and they’ve budgeted it out through the year 2015.now, we’ve had great relations at times, or common interests at times with the bolsheviks, with our humanitarian programs after the russian civil war, with stalin during world war ii.we even offered him the marshall plan aid. %$* 506
with, with brezhnev and andropov with trade, uh, and arms control, and with gorbachev supporting glasnost and perestroika. %$* 506
so even at our worst parts of relations with the soviet union we still, which was actually communist russia, we still had a, a common relation. %$* 506
it didn't take away the fact that they did want to destroy us. %$* 506
but, i think what the danger now is that anti-government regime propaganda in russia is so dominant, where they have shut down a free press, they have shut down all of the radio stations in russia that broadcast radio free europe and radio liberty, that’s us broadcasting, except three or four, so they’ve effectively silenced us. %$* 506
i believe they’ve silenced the bbc russian broadcasts. %$* 506
and then their propagandizing their children, that we are the enemy, that stalin was not a bad guy, that, that russia should not be held accountable for the crimes of the communist past. %$* 506
so, what the regime is teaching its children today tells us a lot about where that regime may be headed. %$* 506
it doesn’t need to head that way. %$* 506
what we need to do is call them on it, as we would call a friend or a neighbor or a wayward relative or somebody else, and try to stop them from taking this path that they’ve chosen to take. %$* 506
michael waller, thank you very much. %$* 106
and now, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for you to decide who carried the day. %$* 106
and i hope you’ve still got your key pads here. %$* 106
um, it’s on the left arm rest of your seat, unless you're on the right, right aisle, in which case it’s on the other arm rest. %$* 106
so, when i tell you to, press one if you're for the notion, two if you're against, and three if you're undecided. %$* 106
so please cast your votes now. %$* 106
very good. %$* 106
and while those, um, are being tabulated, and uh, we’ll hear the results in a moment, i want to first of all announce a few things before thanking both the debaters and the audience. %$* 106
the next intelligence squared us debate will be on tuesday november the 13th here at the asia society museum. %$* 106
and the notion to be debated will be a domestic one. %$* 106
“it’s time to end affirmative action.” nice, uncontroversial motion. %$* 106
it will be moderated by robert siegel, who many of you will know from npr, and the panelists for that debate, for the notion, john mcwhorter, who’s a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and columnist for the new york sun; terence pell, who’s the president of the center for individual rights; and joseph phillips, actor, social commentator, and syndicated columnist. %$* 106
on the other side, against the motion, defending affirmative action, will be khin mai aung, the staff attorney at the asian american legal defense and education fund; kimberlé crenshaw, professor of law at ucla and columbia law school, and tim wise, writer, activist, and educator. %$* 106
now, an edited version of tonight’s intelligence squared us debate can be heard locally on wnyc, which is on am820 megahertz on sunday november the 11th at eight o'clock p.m. %$* 106
so, if you really enjoyed it you can tune in and listen again. %$* 106
or you can hear it for the first time. %$* 106
and please check your local npr member station listings for the dates and times of broadcasts outside new york city. %$* 106
um, no public appearance is complete without a plug, and copies of robert legvold’s book, russian foreign policy in the 21st century in the shadow of the past are on sale upstairs in the lobby and another plug, you can purchase dvds from previous debates here tonight, or from the intelligence squared us web site. %$* 106
and now the debate results, very interesting. %$* 106
it was a bad night to be undecided. %$* 106
after the, um, after the debate, forty-seven percent of you were in favor of the motion, so small rise, but forty-one percent of you were against, which is a huge rise. %$* 106
and only twelve percent were undecided. %$* 106
so, i declare the motion carried but by a much smaller margin than at the beginning. %$* 106
so, both sides have some laurels to rest on. %$* 106
so, thanks very much. %$* 106
good evening to you all. %$* 106

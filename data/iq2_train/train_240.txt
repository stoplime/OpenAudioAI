they haven’t, and they’re not going to. %$* 105
orville schell. %$* 13
let’s bring you into the debate. %$* 13
you know, this isn’t exclusively about one country or another. %$* 621
we’re doing a comparison here, and we’re talking about recent history, not an idealized america. %$* 621
and we’d be very foolish to idealize china. %$* 621
and i think what we have to reckon with is the chances of each country finding a new state of equipoise, the united states included. %$* 621
it is not a foregone conclusion that we’re going to pull this thing out of the water. %$* 621
i think if this country cannot grasp reason again, it doesn’t matter how good or bad china will be, china may have an unfair advantage. %$* 621
i think what’s going on in washington right now is so utterly mad and broken that i put no confidence whatsoever in their ability to play that central role that every government, and i may disagree with you here, peter, but every government must play. %$* 621
and we are not playing it. %$* 621
and orville schell, you, in making that point before, you went on to say that you think that the model of planning, which we used to think was quaint and slightly ridiculous, maybe we should be looking at in a new light now. %$* 13
minxin pei, what about that? %$* 13
is a little planning a good thing after all, or a lot of planning? %$* 13
well, in china, they plan a lot, except they do nothing about the plans they draw up. %$* 623
because if you look at chinese five-year plans, you think, my gosh, these guys are very strategic. %$* 623
and then, five years later, and you do some kind of plan accounting and you see what has been accomplished-- %$* 623
very little, because if they have actually followed through on their promises, china today would indeed be doing capitalism a lot better than the u.s. %$* 623
peter schiff. %$* 13
well, you know-- %$* 622
or do you want to respond to that point? %$* 13
not that particular point, but there’s some other points that he made earlier that i’d-- %$* 622
all right. %$* 13
tell us what the point was and go for it. %$* 13
well, first of all, one of the things that you mentioned, you said that american citizens, we get all kinds of benefits from our government that the chinese citizens don’t get. %$* 622
well, i would say that we get a lot more liability. %$* 622
if you try to figure out what each american share is of the national debt, it is enormous. %$* 622
and what the government is giving the american people is debt. %$* 622
i would much rather-- %$* 622
and if you’re talking about capitalism, you’re defending capitalism by saying we get social security, what’s capitalistic about essentially planned retirement that’s financed like bernie madoff ran his investment business. %$* 622
i think it’s much better that the chinese are free to keep their income and plan for their retirement. %$* 622
minxin pei, take on the question of whether the existence of social security compromises the u.s. claim to be capitalist, which i think is peter’s point. %$* 13
i don’t think so, because capitalism produces efficiency, but it also has a lot of risks. %$* 623
modern capitalist societies are a lot riskier than traditional agrarian societies because in a modern capitalist society, once you lose your job, you really have no source of income. %$* 623
you cannot grow your own potatoes. %$* 623
let me just say something about china. %$* 623
the debt we know about-- %$* 623
because peter says that in the u.s., you-- %$* 623
every citizen gets a lot of-- %$* 623
is responsible for a lot of government debt. %$* 623
the same thing is true of china, because the chinese national debt is actually higher than the american debt. %$* 623
in china-- %$* 623
what are you talking about? %$* 622
okay. %$* 623
in china, the nominal debt is low, 20 percent, but the chinese government knows better than bernie madoff, okay, does a much better job in hiding its liabilities. %$* 623
it would-- %$* 623
we owe them over $2 trillion. %$* 622
no, two trillion dollars is not-- %$* 623
is foreign exchange reserve and i-- %$* 623
well, that's three trillion, if you want-- %$* 622
no, no, that's three trillion. %$* 623
are you saying that liabilities exceed that? %$* 622
oh, the chinese liability is about 80 percent of gdp.the u.s.public health debt is about 60 to 65 percent. %$* 623
the trouble with the chinese people is that after paying taxes, having their government incur so much debt, they get no social security, they get no social protection, so that's why i think even capitalists are coming to this country, to enjoy some kind of protection. %$* 623
well, certainly-- %$* 622
let's orville schell-- %$* 13
wait a minute. %$* 621
china is implementing-- %$* 621
trying to implement a health care system, a social security system, and when you say the chinese people have gotten nothing out of the last 30 years of development, you have surely seen the infrastructure that china has built, which benefits everybody in some way or other. %$* 621
orville, take 10, 15 seconds to describe specifically the kind of infrastructure you're talking about, housing, roads-- %$* 13
well, you look at the highway system, you look at the rails system, we haven't built a tunnel in new york city since the 1920s and the 1930s. %$* 621
china's throwing these things up overnight, bridges, subway systems, you name it. %$* 621
now, i don't want to idealize china's system, but i do want to give credit where credit is due, and it is unfair to say that no benefit is derived from the amazing development of the last 30 years. %$* 621
does this side concede that point? %$* 13
no, i don't concede that point at all. %$* 623
ian bremmer, do you want to come in on this? %$* 13
i wouldn't say that-- %$* 105
to say that chinese get nothing of course is ludicrous. %$* 105
that's like comparing the united states to greece. %$* 105
we don't want to do that, right? %$* 105
clearly chinese citizens are doing better on average than they were before. %$* 105
there's no question, although if you ask where a lot of the profitability from that development has gone, it's gone to the united states. %$* 105
i mean, you look at apple, you look at the manufacturing of the ipad, $9, $10 is captured by china, about 60 goes back to apple and its shareholders, most of whom are american. %$* 105
i like that trade, right? %$* 105
i mean, there's a reason why american multinationals actually do better, but we have a problem in the united states with an increasingly large percentage of americans, right, a book that i think you probably have read by charles murray, "coming apart," increasingly, they're not doing as well. %$* 105
they don't have as much opportunity. %$* 105
we have to address that because if not, long term those folks are going to get upset. %$* 105
but they're not going to be as upset as the hundreds of millions of chinese that will eventually face a crash and will have no opportunity, no option to really revolt against-- %$* 105
peter schiff. %$* 13
you talk about the profits of the u.s. corporations, we'll see how real those profits are when interest rates go up and they're facing an entirely different environment. %$* 622
but you keep talking about living in america, yes, i'm not saying that it's not better to live in america. %$* 622
we still live pretty good because we're able to borrow all this money. %$* 622
we have a phony economy that is perpetuated based on debt. %$* 622
when this debt bubble bursts and this whole thing comes toppling down, it's going to be a whole different story. %$* 622
i don't doubt that people would want to live in america, given our lifestyle. %$* 622
but that's going to change. %$* 622
you're not looking at what's keeping it going. %$* 622
you're not looking at all this debt. %$* 622
and you're saying, "well, the chinese are going to throw good amount of money after bad forever because they have no choice." they do have a choice. %$* 622
the more good money they throw after bad, the more money they're going to lose, and the chinese are figuring this out. %$* 622
the chinese are throwing good money after bad and not just in the united states; they're doing it in china, too. %$* 105
they're building infrastructure, more and more infrastructure that chinese people can't use but they have to keep the growth going. %$* 105
it's better than buying treasuries. %$* 622
comparatively horrific. %$* 105
i mean, i don't know, we can have a long debate about that. %$* 105
i would prefer they did neither and just let their citizens keep their money. %$* 622
okay, but that-- %$* 105
unsustainable u.s.-- %$* 622
second point, if you want to talk about chinese profitability compared to american, look at the few-- %$* 105
the dozens of firms in china that are supposed to be some of the best in breed that have wanted to come to the united states to list. %$* 105
and they list, and they-- %$* 105
and we get inside the books, and we realize they're completely cooked, and they get in massive trouble. %$* 105
and even you know sort of billionaire brilliant folks like john paulson, who figured out the big-- %$* 105
absolutely lose lots of money on that. %$* 105
but yet we do not have-- %$* 105
these companies are not anywhere near as sustainable or profitable as the chinese government makes them out to be, and that is a fundamental structural problem. %$* 105
orville schell. %$* 13
well, the real question is sustainability of our own enterprise. %$* 621
ian, you've just written a wonderful book called, "every nation for itself," and i thought it very interesting to read the following. %$* 621
you talk about the serious psychological toll in this country of the financial crisis and the near economic collapse. %$* 621
and you say, worse still is the fear that america’s leaders can’t fix these problems because the u.s.political system is broken beyond repair. %$* 621
is it? %$* 621
no, that’s the fear that they believe that. %$* 105
and you don’t, you believe that we will regain our sense and be able to restore reason to our decision making and pull out of this nadir of-- %$* 621
i thought it was interesting that you brought up the fact that the united states government is trying to get this 1.2, 1.4 trillion in reductions passed. %$* 105
the democrats and republicans had a basic agreement about it, some of it was iraq, some afghanistan, some was going to be increased airline fees, some was going to be reductions in agriculture subsidies that was fairly easy to do. %$* 105
and then at the last minute, they decided not to do it. %$* 105
but in part the reason they decided not to do it is because they’re not being pressured. %$* 105
in europe-- %$* 105
one second-- %$* 105
i know you’re excited. %$* 105
in europe they are being pressured and they’re finally acting. %$* 105
and it got really ugly before it had to happen. %$* 105
the unfortunate lesson that we are all learning since 2008, the world is getting faster. %$* 105
governments are not getting faster. %$* 105
and that’s true in the united states. %$* 105
we’re kicking the can. %$* 105
that’s true in europe; they’ve done a lot of kicking the can. %$* 105
japan. %$* 105
but the largest can getting kicked hardest down the road is the chinese can, and that’s by far the one i’d be most worried about. %$* 105
peter schiff. %$* 13
well, if you, first looking at your discussions about debt. %$* 622
we didn’t have any serious discussions. %$* 622
that trillion dollars in cuts was an illusion. %$* 622
it was spread out over 10 years, so it’s 100 billion a year in almost a $4 trillion budget and it was simply reductions in the proposed rate of increases. %$* 622
so we weren’t even talking about dealing with the problem. %$* 622
but you are right, we don’t have to deal with it because both the federal reserve continues to print dollars and buy treasuries and the chinese central bank and foreign central banks continue to print their own currencies and buy dollars and buy treasuries. %$* 622
so we are the ones that are literally living on borrowed time. %$* 622
you’ve got to think, what’s going to happen in america when like europe, we are forced to deal with the enormity of the consequences. %$* 622
if you look at our federal debt, which is the funded portion, is financed like a sub-prime mortgage with a teaser rate. %$* 622
how is the u.s. government going to handle 5 or 10 percent interest rates on this national debt? %$* 622
how is the banking system in america going to handle it when all their assets are imploding, their long-term government bonds and mortgages that they have on their books and they can’t get cheap money anymore from the fed. %$* 622
what happens to our housing market? %$* 622
minxin pei. %$* 13
there’s a lot of pessimism about the u.s.on this side. %$* 13
that’s a fair way to argue this, because this is a two part argument, china up and u.s.down. %$* 13
so they’re more heavily i would say on u.s.down than china up. %$* 13
you guys are-- %$* 13
well, people inside china are not very optimistic either about the country’s future prospects. %$* 623
the high growth period for china is over. %$* 623
i urge you to read the world bank’s latest report on china called china 2030.it’s free for downloading on the world bank’s website. %$* 623
this is what it says. %$* 623
from now on until 2030, if china does well, its average growth will be somewhere between 6 and 7 percent. %$* 623
and if china does not do the set of reforms the world bank recommended, probably china cannot even achieve a much reduced level of growth because china is coming into an era where savings will be a lot lower. %$* 623
the population will be a lot older. %$* 623
the environmental costs will be a lot more visible if you-- %$* 623
i’m sure a lot of you have been to beijing. %$* 623
in the future when you’re in beijing, you should bring along a space suit. %$* 623
what is the message that’s getting out to the developing world? %$* 13
who do they want to be more? %$* 13
do they, do developing countries want to be us or do they want to be china? %$* 13
i’ll put that to either side who wants to take it. %$* 13
orville schell, why don’t you take it? %$* 13
well, i think it’s interesting, it’s still, the united states has tremendous luster. %$* 621
i mean it is a great dream machine and we have a great country and many chinese would like to live here. %$* 621
but what is interesting in the last few years is the number of chinese who’ve gone home. %$* 621
and they’ve gone home because they see opportunity. %$* 621
they feel-- %$* 621
anyone who’s been to china lately feels an amazing sense of energy. %$* 621
and i would have to say that these great american virtues of get it done, whatever it takes, can do, i feel, and i’m surprised, more and more, have been incarnate in china and less and less in america. %$* 621
ian bremmer, same question. %$* 13
yeah, i don’t think that china has that kind of luster internationally. %$* 105
and it’s part because the chinese system is really one that is focused on china, period. %$* 105
one of the major problems china has is that for them to build the state capital system, they have to support china and the chinese market. %$* 105
where the system that the united states supports is really one of having as much access to global competition in markets as possible. %$* 105
and ultimately, that’s a much more efficient system. %$* 105
the united states corporations benefit from it. %$* 105
we’re the ones who are pushing the wto.we’re the ones who have been pushing the doha around. %$* 105
when that doesn’t work, we go for the transpacific partnership, the tpp. %$* 105
we want broader markets. %$* 105
the chinese are saying no. %$* 105
for 4g, we want a chinese standard. %$* 105
now, i understand that they’d rather have a chinese standard than an american standard, but the point is that the chinese are saying we want a chinese standard as opposed to a global standard. %$* 105
that-- %$* 105
other countries don’t like that. %$* 105
they want more efficiency, and from that perspective, the chinese incursion into the global free market-- %$* 105
my last book was called “the end of the free market” not because i thought the united states wasn’t going to have a free market anymore but because i thought that the rise of china as the world’s second largest economy eroded what had been global free markets and competition and actually poses an enormous problem for third-party countries. %$* 105
as china gets larger, that challenge grows. %$* 105
and so, not only the domestic challenges, but they will have greater international challenges. %$* 105
i want to go to audience questions now. %$* 13
and what will happen is if you raise your hand, i’ll point to you. %$* 13
if you can stand up, tell us who you are, and a microphone will come to you. %$* 13
hold the microphone about this distance away from your mouth so that the radio broadcast can hear you quite clearly. %$* 13
and i really urge you to keep this on topic, to look at what the motion is, to figure out whether your question actually gets these guys talking about something that focuses on the motion itself. %$* 13
and i just need to say this for radio: we are in the question and answer section of this intelligence squared u.s.debate. %$* 13
i’m john donvan. %$* 13
we have two teams of two debating this motion: "china does capitalism better than america.” questions from the audience. %$* 13
in the front row. %$* 13
i just want to say if you’re sitting in shadow and if you can’t see the numbers on your wristwatch, i can’t see you. %$* 13
so, if you want to ask a question, if you could step forward down the stairs and i’ll try to call on you from there. %$* 13
sir? %$* 13
i’m norbert swisslocki i lived in china for five years. %$* 624
the chinese workers are known for their hard work. %$* 624
this is a question on labor. %$* 624
to what extent does the labor market in china fuel chinese economy whereas the labor market in the united states seems too thwart it? %$* 624
minxin pei, why don’t you take that first. %$* 13
then we’ll come to-- %$* 13
okay, the labor market in china is still not as free as it appears to be. %$* 623
what china has done in terms of making its growth faster is to move a lot of labor from agriculture into the cities. %$* 623
the moment that happens, automatically, they produce a lot more because that’s urban areas, their jobs actually pay them more. %$* 623
so that’s one. %$* 623
but in terms of labor mobility, rural migrants in china still suffer a lot of discrimination, because if they move to cities, i’m sure some of your workers have experienced-- %$* 623
they do not enjoy the benefits of urban residence. %$* 623
for example, they have to stand there; they cannot enroll their kids in public schools. %$* 623
they have to send them to substandard private schools. %$* 623
and they do not enjoy any retirement pension protection. %$* 623
that’s available only for state workers. %$* 623
minxin, how is that statement ammunition for you on this motion? %$* 13
for the motion, which is that if you look at the labor market, per se, you would say china’s labor market is not as free, as well developed, or even regulated than the u.s. %$* 623
i would argue that our labor market is hardly a bastion of freedom either. %$* 622
i mean, first of all, we have a minimum wage law that effectively makes it illegal to hire a pretty sizable chunk of our population that can’t get a job. %$* 622
but even for the americans who are employed, you have the government dictating to employers all sorts of criteria upon which they have to base their decisions on who to hire and who to promote, and there’re all sorts of mandates that, as an employer, you are required. %$* 622
you have to do this, you have to do that, at often great expense to yourself. %$* 622
so, i don’t think you have a lot of freedom in the u.s.labor markets. %$* 622
there are so many different ways you can be sued as an employer in this country that a lot of people do what they can to avoid hiring people because they don’t want to get within the crosshairs of the government or the legal system that has sprung as a result of all these mandates. %$* 622
so, i would think that if you’re an employer in china and you’re hiring people, i don’t think that you have to worry about that as much as an employer in america, that you’re going to be sued by your employee because you, you know, you passed them over for a promotion or maybe you didn’t hire somebody and they want to sue you and claim it’s because you’re, you know, you’re handicapped or you’re a different race. %$* 622
i think you have more freedom there. %$* 622
and to try to-- %$* 622
you know, i mean, i don’t even want to hold up-- %$* 622
and to nail it to the motion, you’re saying, though, that those conditions make it a better form of-- %$* 13
a more efficient form of capitalism. %$* 13
well, i think the fewer rules that you have-- %$* 622
i think labor, employees and employers should be free to negotiate with one another over the terms of their employment without any interference whatsoever from government. %$* 622
right in the center, sir, very center. %$* 13
and no-- %$* 13
yeah-- %$* 13
the person who was standing should continue to stand and wait for a microphone. %$* 13
thank you very much. %$* 18
my question is for the panelists in favor of the motion. %$* 18
while you’re arguing the same conclusion, it seems to me that your premises are at odds with each other if i understand them correctly. %$* 18
on the one hand, mr. %$* 18
schell seems to say that for america to do capitalism better we need more top-down planning by government presumably, while mr. %$* 18
schiff if arguing that we need much less of that and more undirected bottom-up economy. %$* 18
could you reconcile the drivers behind your conclusions? %$* 18
i want to see this. %$* 13
the complex answer to your question is no. %$* 621
yeah, i guess it would be a debate within a debate, but-- %$* 622
but yeah, i mean, i don’t think the solution is for america to become less free and to try to emulate what china does wrong, but to pick up on what china’s doing right. %$* 622
and i think china needs to do the same thing, not follow the poor example of modern america and all the things that we’ve done to wreck our capitalist economy but to turn back the clock and to try to incorporate the system and the values that were enshrined in the constitution by the framers. %$* 622
i think that is real capitalism. %$* 622
you know what’s interesting? %$* 13
i’m-- %$* 13
i like to sort of have a gender balance. %$* 13
i don’t see a single woman raising her hand anywhere. %$* 13
and i-- %$* 13
am i wrong? %$* 13
shout out. %$* 13
thank you, i heard that. %$* 13
i do see, right down in front. %$* 13
hi, my name is mckenna webster i was curious that no one mentioned human rights once this evening. %$* 625
and i’m wondering if you think that that plays a role in a debate on capitalism? %$* 625
orville schell. %$* 13
you know, i think the united states has, over the last decade, been not exactly exemplary as an evangelist for human rights, which has stilled our voice to some degree. %$* 621
this is an aspect of the chinese system which is not exemplary. %$* 621
and we don’t need to and wouldn’t want to imitate it. %$* 621
but having said that, i think we have to be honest that authoritarian capitalism has been able to do things that a freer form of capitalism sometimes fails to be able to do. %$* 621
ian bremmer. %$* 13
i mean, god forbid you’re forced to hire disabled people, right. %$* 105
yes. %$* 105
but we can’t compare human rights in the united states with china, obviously. %$* 105
the u.s. still makes-- %$* 105
does a lot of things wrong. %$* 105
that’s like this broader debate. %$* 105
the u.s.does a lot of things wrong on capitalism but still vastly more effective than china. %$* 105
the u.s.has a lot of problems in human rights, but china isn’t in the same league, right, not on the same league sheets. %$* 105
let’s be very clear. %$* 105
and while i think that a certain level of human rights abuses facilitates rapacious capitalism, especially in the short term, in the long term, it will bite you in the hiney. %$* 105
and there are other places that you get problems, too. %$* 105
i did talk about transparency and the fact that places like facebook and google and twitter are a problem for china because they want to own that data. %$* 105
they want to control it. %$* 105
they want to shape it. %$* 105
they want chinese state internet just like they have state capitalism. %$* 105
that’s a problem for them. %$* 105
when i think about responses in terms of general transparency, in the united states you do actually know largely what your officials are up to. %$* 105
solyndra was a disaster. %$* 105
it was a bad thing for the united states. %$* 105
peter and i will agree on that. %$* 105
but we found out about it. %$* 105
and we found-- %$* 105
on balance, people got egg on their faces. %$* 105
in china, they don’t want to tell you about solyndra. %$* 105
you don’t have media that’s getting inside the dirty laundry of serious chinese officials. %$* 105
they are engineers that run the country. %$* 105
they are also billionaires. %$* 105
let’s remember that, okay. %$* 105
and that’s the problem of the lack of human rights and transparency in china. %$* 105
it doesn’t facilitate creative destruction. %$* 105
it doesn’t facilitate allowing the chinese people to take advantage of a free market. %$* 105
maybe the chinese people would be just as good capitalists as we are, but unfortunately, their system doesn’t allow it to be. %$* 105
and that’s a problem. %$* 105
peter schiff. %$* 13
if you’re going to get into the argument that if a government can require or dictate to a private employer and say, “you have to hire somebody with a disability,” that doesn’t create rights, that diminishes individual rights. %$* 622
what you're doing is you're creating a special privilege for one particular protected class. %$* 622
and when you do that, you diminish freedom, and you diminish liberty in the country, but apart from that, you create all sorts of problems for the businesses because now the businesses have to spend all sorts of money to protect themselves against lawsuits. %$* 622
and in many cases, people that would have tried to bend over backwards to hire the disabled, now they won't touch them because they're too afraid of getting sued. %$* 622
to the question as it was put, then, does human rights have any relevance to this debate about capitalism, you're saying, yes, it does, it gets in the way of capitalism. %$* 13
well, i mean, if you're-- %$* 622
are you differentiating-- %$* 622
no-- %$* 622
are you differentiating human rights from individual rights? %$* 622
i mean, i believe in individual freedom and i believe in rights, and it certainly is part of the discussion. %$* 622
and the question is where do you have more individual freedom or individual liberty? %$* 622
do you have more right now in china or do you have more in the united states? %$* 622
and my argument earlier is that the typical person in china is going to surrender less of his economic output to his government in the form of taxation, and i don't think his day-to-day life is going to be as impacted as heavily as they are in america as far as regulations. %$* 622
but, we have-- %$* 622
as far as trial, there are political prisoners in the united states, too, it's not just in china, i mean, my father's in prison for politics i believe, in this country. %$* 622
there's a gentleman wearing a-- %$* 13
i believe a green necktie. %$* 13
everybody is going like this now. %$* 13
yes, sir. %$* 13
barry belgeride-- %$* 626
i just need to get the microphone to you. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
barry belgeride considering that our government owes 100 percent of gdp, spends 40 percent of gdp, just took over one-seventh of the economy in the face of health care, owns a big part of our biggest heavy equipment manufacturing, which is detroit, and regulates very heavily the financial industry, do we truly have capitalism in this country? %$* 626
well, i already said we don't. %$* 622
i mean, we're not even close to having capitalism. %$* 622
we have-- %$* 622
if i was trying to figure out a word that described it, it's fascism is really what we have. %$* 622
those of you who are-- %$* 622
don't understand what it is, it's not fascism like hitler or mussolini, but it's the economic system. %$* 622
it's a socialist system where the government takes over the means of production through taxation and regulation. %$* 622
and that's what we have. %$* 622
i mean, any business, i own my business but the u.s.government makes a lot more money from my business than i do. %$* 622
i mean, it's not even close. %$* 622
the amount of money i earn running my business is tiny in comparison to the taxes the government collects from my business. %$* 622
so the government has effectively nationalized my business and-- %$* 622
peter, may i respectfully say that the subject of our discussion-- %$* 621
orville schell. %$* 13
your teammate, orville schell, is speaking. %$* 13
is really not this. %$* 621
what we're really discussing is which economy does marketization best. %$* 621
okay. %$* 13
well, ian bremmer decided to just let all of that happen-- %$* 13
yeah. %$* 105
and now responding, minxin pei. %$* 13
well, i'll say, to use debt as a measure of capitalism is not right because private companies can borrow 200 percent of their equity and still be private. %$* 623
i think the best measure of whether a country is capitalist is to look at the contribution to gdp from state-owned companies. %$* 623
and here the u.s.cannot even compare. %$* 623
in china state- owned companies contribute 40 percent to gdp. in the u.s., i don't know about gm-- %$* 623
the u.s.is getting out of gm, incidentally. %$* 623
now, probably little less than 1 percent. %$* 623
so rest assured, we are still very capitalist. %$* 623
well, you can't compare though government debt to corporate debt. %$* 622
if a corporation borrows, it does so to increase its productivity. %$* 622
it's acquiring income generating assets that enable it to service that debt and retire the debt, so that's productive debt. %$* 622
when you're talking about the federal debt, you're talking about money that has been borrowed and spent on consumption on government. %$* 622
no, we are-- %$* 623
and there's no means of repaying it. %$* 622
you're looking at-- %$* 622
the federal government is not the consumer. %$* 623
it is a producer of public goods. %$* 623
it doesn't produce. %$* 622
it's a giant consumer. %$* 622
of course. %$* 623
what is it producing? %$* 622
look, when your company goes abroad and invests, where is the security it gets? %$* 623
security services it gets from? %$* 623
i think the pentagon for one thing actually does something in return for the u.s. people. %$* 623
orville schell, do you want to butt in this before we move on? %$* 13
no. %$* 621
another question, sir. %$* 13
hi, my name is guy wiggins i just wanted to hear from the panel their thoughts on how the one-child policy has affected capitalism in china and what the future means when you have far more men than women, and how that's going to basically i think lead to all kinds of irrational inefficiencies in the market. %$* 627
i wondered how you were going to turn that to the motion. %$* 13
that was very good. %$* 13
that was very good. %$* 13
orville schell. %$* 13
here i would say the advantage is emphatically on the american side because we have immigration. %$* 621
china does not and china has one of the most rapidly aging populations. %$* 621
and the lower reaches are not being replenished with the one-child policy, so it’s going to have a huge burden of taking care of elderly people and not have younger people coming in on the bottom to support them. %$* 621
that’s going to be a giant problem. %$* 621
i agree with orville, not surprisingly. %$* 105
and furthermore, it also leads china to export not just capital when they try to extract commodities for example in sub-saharan africa, but also labor because they need to do something with those men. %$* 105
that’s a problem for african countries that want to have employment in addition to chinese cash. %$* 105
and eventually it leads to a backlash. %$* 105
again, chinese state capitalism is a problem not just because of domestic inefficiencies but because of the backlash it creates globally. %$* 105
that’s one we haven’t started to experience yet because china isn’t big enough yet. %$* 105
but as it gets bigger, it’s going to get squeezed. %$* 105
i think a lot of that is going to be taken care of liberalized immigration. %$* 622
i think women are going to come into china, particularly when the chinese standard of living is allowed to rise based on a stronger rmb and when the chinese no longer have to devote such massive resources to propping up the u.s. economy and their own economy is that much more prosperous, i think you’re going to see more immigrants coming into china. %$* 622
can you, just because you used the term to our radio audience, rmb. %$* 13
the currency, the chinese rnb, the yuan. %$* 622
ma’am. %$* 13
fourth row. %$* 13
i want to ask-- %$* 19
can you start again, thanks. %$* 13
before we get into the debate, how do we define capitalism, we talk about it, elements of-- %$* 19
ma’am, can you, we missed a little bit of the beginning. %$* 13
and just for the broadcast, we need also. %$* 13
i’m going to stop talking in a second and then if you can start. %$* 13
thanks, go ahead. %$* 13
i want to ask each panel how you define capitalism. %$* 19
you talk about, i think different elements that contribute to capitalism or obviously america does something better and china does something better. %$* 19
if you keep comparing one to one, we never get to a conclusion. %$* 19
how do you-- %$* 19
china does five things better than america, america does five other things better. %$* 19
how do you define which one %$* 19
okay rather than go one, two, three, four, i just want to let each side pick somebody to answer that question, assuming you agree with each other. %$* 13
peter schiff, do you take a side, or take a side for? %$* 13
well, i mean, capitalism to me is where the means of production are controlled completely privately. %$* 622
where the factors of production, production, land, labor and capital are allocated through a market where prices for all goods and services, wages, interest rates, are set by the market. %$* 622
as opposed to a centrally planned or socialist economy where a lot of these decisions are made by bureaucrats and where the means of production is being micro-managed from a centrally planned authority. %$* 622
where they’re making decisions based on politics, this should be produced; that should be produced; this should be favored, that should be favored. %$* 622
and whether the government does it directly, like a communist would, by nationalizing the means of production and actually owning them, or rather it takes a different route by controlling them through the tax code, through what it taxes and what it subsidies. %$* 622
and how it regulates and what businesses it favors and what it punishes. %$* 622
when you start doing that, you don’t have capitalism, you have something else. %$* 622
so by that definition, neither china nor the united states is capitalist. %$* 13
well that’s what i started. %$* 622
i said the question should be, which question does it worse? %$* 622
not which one does it better. %$* 622
minxin pei. %$* 13
well, i cannot have said it better. %$* 623
i think that’s the best description of the chinese economic system. %$* 623
the part about what capitalism is not. %$* 623
but i would add one more thing. %$* 623
i think modern capitalism also has a legal system. %$* 623
the rule of law. %$* 623
without the rule of law, there can be no capitalism. %$* 623
and china does not have rule of law. %$* 623
i’ll just let the mic come to you. %$* 13
and name please. %$* 13
yeah, my name is dan o’connor, i’m running for u.s.congress here in new york city as a democrat. %$* 628
one hundred thousand chinese people in my district. %$* 628
i lived in china for six years and i think in order to engage in this debate, we should define the term capitalism. %$* 628
i think peter did define that term. %$* 628
i do think you’re all very erudite in your-- %$* 628
and very articulate in comparing the two systems. %$* 628
but i think in terms of capitalism, peter did define that. %$* 628
but also, i don’t think it’s fair to use world bank figures because they’re not on the ground. %$* 628
sir, i need you to get to a question. %$* 13
okay. %$* 628
actually, i guess to get right to the question. %$* 628
i’d like to hear a definition of capitalism from everyone. %$* 628
okay, we just did that. %$* 13
i think we-- %$* 13
we’ll move on then. %$* 13
right here sir. %$* 13
wait-- %$* 13
hubbub down. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
joseph conzelman %$* 629
my question is as china, like other low and mid-income countries, moves up the value chain, it’s going to eventually have to start to turn ideas into products instead of just assembling products. %$* 629
how do you expect that to occur in china, given the current status of intellectual property rights and in other related terms like that where it’s just very hard to create ideas and own them in china? %$* 629
orville schell. %$* 13
this is a huge problem for china. %$* 621
and china is creating intellectual property, and as it does, i think it’s going to bring itself to heel. %$* 621
one hopes it will, and it simply must or it can’t be a world player. %$* 621
but china must move up the value chain, because the labor is getting more expensive. %$* 621
they’re just lower down than we are. %$* 621
america doesn’t do much manufacturing anymore, not as much as it used to. %$* 621
it’s had to move up the value chain into knowledge and information technology. %$* 621
that’s china’s challenge too. %$* 621
i think the question did its work for you. %$* 13
do you-- %$* 13
do you want to comment on that. %$* 13
no, i think that it’s absolutely a problem, and i guess i would say that i’m more skeptical than orville they’re going to be able to do it. %$* 105
i see the problem as you do, in part because the educational system doesn’t support it. %$* 105
they create a lot of engineers, but they don’t create a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of innovators because they’re still teaching by rote as opposed to teaching students to actually question, you know, sort of what’s behind. %$* 105
and there’s a reason why so many folks that create things in the united states are college dropouts or, you know, sort of came from these kind of unusual background systems. %$* 105
they really want to know not just what four times four is but also why it works that way. %$* 105
that doesn’t work well within authoritarian system. %$* 105
again, human rights are a part of that. %$* 105
transparency is a part of it. %$* 105
i think when you look at the u.s.system, you have to put it all together. %$* 105
it works in part and it’s resilient in part because it’s so integrated, the political and the economic together. %$* 105
you can’t take the politics out of the chinese economic system. %$* 105
if you could, they’d be doing much better right now and they’d have a longer term trajectory that i’d be much more supportive of. %$* 105
what we’re debating at this intelligence squared u.s.debate, china does capitalism better than america. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your moderator. %$* 13
we have four debaters, two teams of two debating this motion. %$* 13
and we’re taking questions from the audience. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 630
i’m peter goodman with the huffington post and former shanghai bureau chief with the washington post. %$* 630
i want to get your thoughts on how the growth slowdown plays out in china. %$* 630
does that cause the state to double down on the state-owned sector and hang onto control of the state-owned enterprises, or does it tend toward more liberalization in an attempt to get a little bit more vibrance out of the private sector? %$* 630
are you putting your question to either side? %$* 13
anybody who’s game. %$* 630
i’d particularly like to hear ian brenner and minxin pei and orville, but anybody who wants to jump in. %$* 630
okay. %$* 13
minxin pei. %$* 13
as the world bank’s prognosis shows that the slowdown is coming no matter what. %$* 623
the debate is when it’s going to happen and the speed at which the slowdown is going to happen. %$* 623
what the chinese government is going to respond-- %$* 623
there are two paths. %$* 623
one is to double-down and to do the things they’ve been doing, that is a lot of investment in infrastructure that’s going to yield increasing returns and growth will continue to slow. %$* 623
and that will be a dead end. %$* 623
the other will be a very different trajectory; that is, to really become capitalist, which means to increase domestic consumption, to allocate capital much more efficiently, incidentally, in china, the capital market as we know it does not exist. %$* 623
most of the savings is allocated through the state-controlled banking sector. %$* 623
so, they’ve got to change that. %$* 623
and they’ve got to privatize state-owned enterprises-- %$* 623
lots and lots of things that can be done to avert that kind of dramatic slowdown. %$* 623

so for the law to have any consistence, currency, it has to be applied across the board with certain selectivity. %$* 325
which leads me to my last element, hamas is an adolescent hezbollah, and look at what hezbollah has become next door. %$* 325
the strongest power in lebanon and the first one to ever defeat israel. %$* 325
so there’s a sort of the assumption that hamas can be extricated from that political reality is unrealistic. %$* 325
ladies and gentlemen, given half a chance, prime minister ismail haniya and his hamas colleagues are gerry adamses in the making. %$* 325
voting for this motion essentially means endorsing and supporting a unilateral, sterile understanding of this conflict. %$* 325
i invite you to exercise intelligence, display fairness, and vote against the motion. %$* 325
thank you for your attention. %$* 325
and against the proposition, i'm sorry for the proposition, i misspoke. %$* 321
for the proposition, daniel ayalon. %$* 321
thank you very much. %$* 326
can you hear me? %$* 326
now start the clock now. %$* 326
good evening, thank you very much for being here. %$* 326
with all due respect to my colleagues and my team, steven cook and john o’sullivan who did a fantastic job, i must even thank more our adversaries, stanley cohen and mahmoud, which did a great job actually convincing you i'm sure, to actually vote for the motion that hamas is a terror organization. %$* 326
actually i will depart. %$* 326
naively i thought that uh, they will relate to the nature of hamas. %$* 326
what do they do? %$* 326
what do they believe in? %$* 326
what is their conduct? %$* 326
but no, they actually opened the debate to a more geopolitical and historic um, issues which actually leave me on a much firmer ground. %$* 326
so i will depart from the notes i prepared here and i will answer the, my esteemed colleagues here on the other side who talked about occupation, who talked about israeli aggression, who talked about un resolutions, and i will say something which is very, very simple. %$* 326
israel was attacked in 1967 by three countries around us, jordan, egypt, and syria. %$* 326
the “occupation,” quote-unquote as they call it, is this territory which was obtained by israel as an act of self-defense. %$* 326
these three countries and others were trying to push us into the sea and actually destroy israel, destroy the jewish people who came back to their historic land, to their biblical land, to the place where they belong. %$* 326
now, the war happened in 1967.israel was created in 19-, or was recreated in 1948.from 1948 to 1967, nineteen years, there was no occupation. %$* 326
west bank belonged to jordan, gaza belonged to uh, egypt, nobody talked about occupation then. %$* 326
nobody talked about creating a palestinian state. %$* 326
] you know why? %$* 326
because they wanted to create this palestinian state right where israel is now today, killing all the jews. %$* 326
so from 1967 on, against her will, we had to defend ourselves and obtain possession of these territories. %$* 326
but still, we always wanted peace. %$* 326
the proof, 1977.when we had a leader like anwar sadat of egypt, and he signed a peace treaty with us and he renounced terror and violence and he recognized israel, israel withdrew entirely from the sinai, having peace with jordan now for more than thirty years, uh, with egypt for more than thirty years. %$* 326
1995, jordan, king hussein, a great leader, wanted to make peace. %$* 326
we made peace. %$* 326
we withdrew from some, all the land that we occupied from jordan and there is a peace between israel and jordan, recognizing each other, respecting each other, and not shooting at each other. %$* 326
in 1993, israel, believing that the palestinians really had a change of heart and they would like to make peace with us, we signed as the oslo accord. %$* 326
and the oslo accord was a very simple view, land for peace. %$* 326
israel withdrawing from west bank in gaza, the palestinians got a hold of themselves, stopped the terror, and becoming a responsible party. %$* 326
2000, camp david, former prime minister barak meeting with uh, with arafat to try and make peace. %$* 326
barak is offering to withdraw from the entire territories, but this was not accepted by arafat. %$* 326
not only was it not accepted, but after it was rejected, this intifada started. %$* 326
intifada is a misnomer, it was a very planned, pre-planned campaign of terror which cost more than a thousand israeli lives, many children, devastation in our cities, and uh, continued rejection of the very notion of the right of israel to exist in its home land. %$* 326
now people compare between camp david ’78 that succeeded with saddam hussein, with, with us with sadat. %$* 326
i'm very tired, i came back from israel not a few hours ago, between sadat and arafat, camp david 2000. what was the difference? %$* 326
the difference was leadership. %$* 326
sadat wanted to make peace. %$* 326
he prevailed over the advice of his advisors and signed a peace treaty. %$* 326
arafat also unfortunately prevailed over the advice of his advisors who said sign the peace treaty because you will not get a better deal. %$* 326
and he was against it. %$* 326
now hamas was against arafat. %$* 326
they did not even believe in any negotiations. %$* 326
they are against, and they were against oslo, why? %$* 326
because they do not believe in israel’s right to exist. %$* 326
they do not believe in coexistence, they do not believe in peace. %$* 326
they do not believe even, in a democracy. %$* 326
because they would like to have one islamist palestinian country a la iran, iran style and under the sharia, the, the, the law of, of islam. %$* 326
so lets go back to the debate tonight. %$* 326
what is the definition of terror? %$* 326
killing intentionally of innocent people. %$* 326
what does hamas do? %$* 326
killing only, only children and innocent people. %$* 326
they stand terrorists strapped in explosives into markets, into pizzerias, into coffee shops, and into school buses and kindergartens. %$* 326
this is what they do. %$* 326
are they a terrorist organization? %$* 326
if this is the definition of terror, they definitely are a terrorist organization. %$* 326
secondly, do they believe in coexistence? %$* 326
no, they deny israel’s right to exist. %$* 326
now people here are talking about whether elected democratically or not, this is besides the point. %$* 326
just look into the hamas, www.hamas.com in their website on the internet and look into the hamas charter. %$* 326
they believe in killing, they don’t believe in israel, they don’t believe in any peace. %$* 326
so are they a terror organization? %$* 326
according to this definition, they are as well. %$* 326
now there is another issue here. %$* 326
who is hamas operated by? %$* 326
are they really doing the will of the people? %$* 326
i don't think so. %$* 326
my esteemed colleague here on the other side, stanley cohen said he just returned from damascus and he met khaled meshaal? %$* 326
where did he meet khaled meshaal? %$* 326
in damascus. %$* 326
who is really operating khaled meshaal? %$* 326
the syrians, and the iranians. %$* 326
so they’re not really playing. %$* 326
they’re not really representing palestinian authentic interest. %$* 326
they are representing the interest of this crazy islamist in iran, and in damascus. %$* 326
are they a terror organization? %$* 326
i think yes, i think all of you should vote for this motion. %$* 326
now there is this question whether they were democratically elected. %$* 326
well i would say a broad definition of democracy is you know, doing the will of the people but also observing the rule of law. %$* 326
and the rule of law does not permit gangs to be brandishing their guns and going with bullets into the ballots. %$* 326
uh, don’t take just the case of hamas. %$* 326
look at what happens. %$* 326
i mean we should apply this global world, global community, the same yardstick for everywhere. %$* 326
there were elections held in iraq, in afghanistan, in the former yugoslavia. %$* 326
in all these elections, armed gangs were denied the right of voting and also of being elected. %$* 326
the same case should have been with hamas but for some reason, this thing was ignored and hamas was allowed to run. %$* 326
and i think this was a mistake. %$* 326
unfortunately, hamas won but it’s not because the people voted for their ideology – time’s up. %$* 326
it’s because it was a protest vote against fatah which was corrupt and ineffective. %$* 326
so this is the reason why hamas was elected. %$* 326
did it change their character? %$* 326
not at all. %$* 326
does a formal process change intrinsically what hamas stand for? %$* 326
now after the elections, they still are killing. %$* 326
there are more than a thousand rockets fired from gaza into our towns, killing babies and children, and there’s no reason for that since we left gaza entirely. %$* 326
we left gaza entirely in order to give palestinians a chance to show everybody that they can govern themselves responsibly. %$* 326
that they can do away with terror and incitement and start negotiation with us. %$* 326
time is up. %$* 326
just vote for the motion. %$* 326
and the final opening argument is an argument against from mark perry. %$* 321
the problem, the problem isn’t that hamas is a terrorist organization. %$* 327
the problem is that hamas is a muslim organization, that’s what scares the hell out of us. %$* 327
and we ought to put it all out on the table and just say it. %$* 327
and how do we know that? %$* 327
because the united states has dealt with terrorist organizations throughout its history and so has israel. %$* 327
there were no preconditions for any talks with the plo in 1993.and yasser arafat made sure of that. %$* 327
he said, we’ll recognize you after you talk to us. %$* 327
that was no preconditions. %$* 327
why do we have conditions on hamas? %$* 327
because they’re muslims, they don’t look like us, we say they don’t have our values. %$* 327
how do i know that we deal with terrorist organizations? %$* 327
because tomorrow the president of the united states is meeting with a man by the name of nouri al-maliki. %$* 327
who is he? %$* 327
nouri al-maliki is the head of the dawa party. %$* 327
who is the dawa party? %$* 327
the dawa party opposed saddam hussein when we supported saddam hussein. %$* 327
we put them on the terrorism list. %$* 327
when we changed sides, we took them off the terrorism list. %$* 327
that doesn’t matter. %$* 327
they bombed the us embassy in kuwait and killed three americans. %$* 327
we’re talking to him because it’s in our interest to talk to him, terrorist or not. %$* 327
so what is the problem with hamas? %$* 327
well if you listen to the media and if you listen to our political leaders, here’s what they have to say. %$* 327
they don’t have our values. %$* 327
our judeo-christian values. %$* 327
what values would those be? %$* 327
i'm a nice white boy from wisconsin, grew up as a lutheran. %$* 327
and i can tell you in my religion and i had to memorize through an ordeal the catechism of martin luther, one of the real anti-semites of our era. %$* 327
they do not have a legitimacy. %$* 327
how do political parties and movements gain legitimacy? %$* 327
it’s not conferred by israel or the united states as conferred by the people. %$* 327
they won an election. %$* 327
oh no, their critics say. %$* 327
they didn’t win the election, fatah lost it. %$* 327
okay. %$* 327
fatah lost it because fatah couldn't organize itself credibly and competently to stand for election and because fatah accepted twenty million dollars in american election aid. %$* 327
and as soon as that came out in the washington post and was reprinted in the west bank in gaza, they lost votes. %$* 327
they want to destroy israel, so did the plo.they have a charter that says they want to destroy israel. %$* 327
so do the plo.and yet we’ve had hamas leaders that say the following. %$* 327
we have a charter that says, yes we admit it, we want to destroy israel. %$* 327
but the charter’s not the quran, and it can be changed. %$* 327
and under the right circumstances, if we can talk to our adversaries, we can and we will change it. %$* 327
the other argument that we say, we’ve heard it tonight. %$* 327
they provide social services. %$* 327
oh cynical people, how could they do that? %$* 327
you mean they’re actually trying to serve their people, clear up corruption? %$* 327
i too was talking to hamas leaders when i was in the middle east. %$* 327
just one week ago, osama hamdan, the foreign minister of hamas, here’s what they’ve done. %$* 327
they’ve penetrated the education health ministries, cleaned them up, that’s forty percent of the total employment of the government of palestine. %$* 327
they’ve thrown out the corrupt people. %$* 327
they’ve taken over the ministry, they’ve started to provide services to people. %$* 327
they’ve kicked out fatah members who are in exile around the world for stealing money from the palestinian people. %$* 327
don’t we want good governance? %$* 327
shouldn't we talk to people who want good governance, who stand for elections? %$* 327
they kill innocent people. %$* 327
they have killed innocent people, rudely, terribly, like others have. %$* 327
it’s not an excuse to say, well the israelis have done it. %$* 327
well lehi did it. %$* 327
that’s not an excuse. %$* 327
they’ve killed innocent people and they come out to be absolved. %$* 327
but after long discussions with hamas, conducted by my organization, painful discussions, arguments about the killing of innocents, not moral arguments, practical, effective, political arguments. %$* 327
they stopped. %$* 327
i’d like to take credit. %$* 327
they stopped these suicide bombers through talk because they realized how ineffective they were, how they were losing support for what they feel is a legitimate cause. %$* 327
there hasn’t been a hamas-led suicide bombing in israel since august of 2004.that’s a fact. %$* 327
people can change. %$* 327
there are three conditions for hamas being recognized as a legitimate political party. %$* 327
to renounce violence, to give up their arms, and to recognize israel. %$* 327
we’ve been through this and through this with hamas, and we’ve said why don’t you do this? %$* 327
and the best answer that i’ve had from a hamas leader is as followed. %$* 327
if we do that, if we renounce violence, if we give up our arms, and if we recognize israel, what’s there to talk about? %$* 327
what do we talk to our enemies about? %$* 327
do you think we’re going to say, oh welcome to the world of nations? %$* 327
finally we’ll withdraw to the sixty-seven borders? %$* 327
here’s what we would like. %$* 327
we will recognize israel, khaled meshaal has said this very straight forward in damascus again and again and again and again. %$* 327
we understand and we recognize that the israeli people, the jewish people have a narrative, it’s an important narrative. %$* 327
we’ve listened to it for many, many years. %$* 327
we have a narrative. %$* 327
here’s our narrative. %$* 327
in 1948, we lived on a land that was called palestine. %$* 327
many of us were kicked off our land and now live in refugee camps. %$* 327
we have legitimate grievances. %$* 327
if you will recognize our legitimate grievances, and recognize our narrative as a people, we can begin to share a narrative, to have talks. %$* 327
but until that point comes, when you stand up and say we understand that you have grievances that have to be addressed, we’re not going to recognize anybody. %$* 327
we’re going to represent our people. %$* 327
now here’s what’s happening, i think, in the middle east. %$* 327
now, and i just returned from beirut. %$* 327
there are, on the internet, calls for the assassination of the leaders of hezbollah and hamas by the leaders of al qaeda. %$* 327
why? %$* 327
because hamas and hezbollah have accepted the western, colloidal mandate, to stand for elections and represent their people. %$* 327
al qaeda thinks that’s a trick. %$* 327
hamas and hezbollah don’t. %$* 327
they answer to their people. %$* 327
we are lumping together the girondists with the jacobins. %$* 327
we are lumping together the true reformers in the middle east, the ones who want to answer to their people with the people who drove their airplanes into our buildings. %$* 327
we are forcing the gironde – for those of you who remember french history – into the mountain, into the jacobins. %$* 327
it is, it is so counterproductive. %$* 327
we are radicalizing the region. %$* 327
there are moderates in islam. %$* 327
they’re called hamas whether we like it or not. %$* 327
and it’s time to open up to them. %$* 327
i thank you. %$* 327
one. %$* 321
we are forcing the gironde – for those of you who remember french history – into the mountain, into the jacobins. %$* 327
it is, it is so counterproductive. %$* 327
we are radicalizing the region. %$* 327
there are moderates in islam. %$* 327
they’re called hamas whether we like it or not. %$* 327
and it’s time to open up to them. %$* 327
i thank you. %$* 327
thank you very much to our six debaters, three for and three against. %$* 321
and i'm now ready to announce to tell you the results of the vote that was taken before tonight’s debate began. %$* 321
before the debate, we’ve counted the ballots. %$* 321
one hundred and sixty-one of you voted for the motion. %$* 321
fifty-one of you voted against the motion. %$* 321
and fifty-six of you said you didn’t know. %$* 321
and to remind, the motion is “a democratically-elected hamas is still a terrorist organization.” again, a hundred and sixty-one in favor, fifty-one against and fifty-six of you said you had not made up your mind. %$* 321
now we are ready to begin the audience question portion of the program. %$* 321
i'm going to call on the questioners. %$* 321
uh, we have someone on each side of the auditorium here who is going to come to you with a microphone and we ask that you stand uh, when you ask your question. %$* 321
and we also ask that you please make your question short and to the point. %$* 321
we ask that members of the press, identify yourselves, uh, tell us who you are. %$* 321
and we ask that members of the audience who are not in the press uh, we want to tell you, you have the option to either identify yourself or not. %$* 321
so we will get underway and lets see, we have a question here in the front, yes. %$* 321
um, this is for the people who are for the motion. %$* 328
it seems that the us wants democratically elected uh, governments in the middle east only if it’s one that they like. %$* 328
not just hamas, but for example the reticence to have free and fair elections in egypt out of concern that the muslim brotherhood would prevail. %$* 328
isn’t that a little bit hypocritical, and as a corollary to that, when these groups are actually voted in, doesn’t the necessity of governance and the compromises they have to make in order to govern moderate them anyway? %$* 328
is that directed at one individual or any one of those? %$* 321
mr. %$* 328
o’sullivan. %$* 328
alright. %$* 328
i, i may take a different view from some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle on this question. %$* 324
um as a matter of fact, my sticking point is violence. %$* 324
do you, do groups who are standing for election continue to advocate and practice violence? %$* 324
that’s, to me is the sine qua non, if they do, if they maintain a private army, if they are uh, if they are acting as for example, um, the ira continued to act for some years after the good friday agreement, i'm against that. %$* 324
now i think in the case of uh, islamist standing for election, i'm absolutely in favor of it. %$* 324
i think the american government is taking a risk in, in urging free elections when it will, they’ll sometimes bring to power people who are hostile to american foreign policy. %$* 324
but that’s a risk which we have to take. %$* 324
after all, it’s a risk which we take with every other part of the world and, and we have to live with that. %$* 324
i think in the case of hamas, we put ourselves in a somewhat false position and my pos-, and this is a rather complicated point here, but once we had accepted the legitimacy of hamas standing, it seems to me we had crossed that rubicon. %$* 324
and once they, having, their having been elected, we simply had to accept that they were, they were there. %$* 324
i would not have said that they were a legitimate contender in the election myself until, as i say, they’d abandoned violence which is my, in a sense, not my sole criterion, perhaps, but my overriding criterion. %$* 324
can i just add something to that judy? %$* 322
sure. %$* 321
on this question of the united states only liking the people that gets elected, and you mentioned the issue of egypt and since i'm writing a book about egypt, i, i, i feel compelled to respond. %$* 322
there’s not a single egyptian official, nor is there a single american government official who believes who has, that the united states is no longer pressing the egyptians on democratic reform. %$* 322
it’s just not true. %$* 322
in fact i was in cairo in september, and at the same time that the united states government presented papers to the egyptian government that included benchmarks for democratic change. %$* 322
and that is even with eighty- eight members of the muslim brotherhood in the egyptian parliament. %$* 322
the difference between the muslim brotherhood in hamas is that the muslim brotherhood in egypt has not engaged in an act of violence since at least the 1970s. %$* 322
you can’t say the same thing about hamas. %$* 322
well that’s terrific, they haven’t – %$* 322
well that’s because there’s, there’s been a million, there’s been a million people that belong to the muslim brotherhood and probably two hundred thousand in egypt that are in jail because they’re – %$* 323
hold it, stanley. %$* 322
as, as soon as the muslim brotherhood tries to run for election, they get jailed. %$* 323
they get tortured. %$* 323
they get, eighty-eight, eighty- eight members. %$* 323
no, no, no, no, come on stanley. %$* 322
who’s controlling egypt? %$* 323
the brotherhood? %$* 323
we clearly know - %$* 322
no, no. %$* 323
we clearly know who’s controlling egypt. %$* 322
the question asked is – %$* 323
it’s certainly not the muslim brotherhood. %$* 322
do we support democracies – %$* 323
but they did – %$* 322
and do we oppose democracies that we don’t and the reality of it is – you know - %$* 323
when musharraf – %$* 323
actually you know this. %$* 322
musharraf became – %$* 323
you have absolutely no understanding of what the us government is doing right now to promote democracy in the middle east. %$* 322
ask the audience. %$* 323
this is all very entertaining - %$* 322
they see it every night on television what the united states is doing to promote democracy. %$* 323
if you're with us, you're okay. %$* 323
if you're not, you're a good muslim or a bad muslim, mr. %$* 323
bush, it doesn’t change no matter what you want to call it. %$* 323
who’s going to be the next president of egypt? %$* 327
you think it’s going to be democratically elected? %$* 327
right. %$* 323
or is it going to be - %$* 327
or jordan, or jordan. %$* 323
that other bastion of support, progressive ideology that the israeli ambassadors supports. %$* 323
you're good if you're with us and if you're not, you're not. %$* 323
and it really doesn’t matter. %$* 323
if you follow our politics, you're a good guy, and if you don’t, you're trafe how is that, expert in egypt? %$* 323
well i think this is, i think that this is really nonsense. %$* 326
i think we are here talking, you know, in just slogans, democracy and first of all we have to remember, you know elections, democracy doesn’t start with elections, it doesn’t end with elections. %$* 326
there is a culture, there is, there should be a rule of law, there should be a participation of all walks of life in a society. %$* 326
unfortunately we have a backwards situation in all the muslim and arab countries where there is no, basically there is no middle class. %$* 326
there is only elite who really control all the resources, all the political power, all the economics, and everything else and all the others are poor, uneducated. %$* 326
and they, and really they are subject to the incitement of the ideological zealots from iran - %$* 326
what an arrogant statement to talk about five thousand year old culture – %$* 323
stanley, chill out, you’ll get an opportunity. %$* 322
i'm talking about facts, i'm just talking about facts. %$* 326
so what i, what i would answer to you is no, we should not promote democracy in the middle east. %$* 326
what we should promote is equal opportunities. %$* 326
what we should promote is empowerment of women. %$* 326
what we should p-, uh, promote is good education for the people so there’s not these inequalities. %$* 326
and when the people themselves will have a stake in their own lives, in their societies, they will decide what type of regime they do want. %$* 326
what the ambassador means to say is, there won't be a vote until the people are ready which is just exactly what j. edgar hoover said about african americans in america – please. %$* 327
thirty years ago. %$* 327
this has nothing to do with that and uh, irrelevant. %$* 326
just a quick comment on this, with all due respect to the ambassador – %$* 325
and then we’ll get to the next question. %$* 321
yeah, i, i, this is precisely what i meant by unilateral understanding. %$* 325
we, i mean we, here again, we have to decide this, we have to support, we have, it’s, it’s, it’s very, very materialistic. %$* 325
it’s as if all of these populations have no sense of what is important to them, what is legitimate for them, who stands for them. %$* 325
i mean fatah has lost all credibility in that, in that area not simply because of external support, essentially for what they’ve done with the b-building of apartments in dubai and so on and so forth. %$* 325
the people know who stands for them, people know who will defend them. %$* 325
and if hamas has left that scene which was, as i said, a military scene as, and has chosen to represent the democratic, uh, in a democratic way this, these groups, then it’s something that speaks for the values of these people. %$* 325
and keep in mind as well, who was fielded in these elections. %$* 325
pharmacists, doctors, professors, i mean business, women, this is not simply a group of, as you called them earlier, “thugs in limousines.” khaled meshaal, last weekend at his, last week in his press conference, was citing foreign affairs articles by richard haass. %$* 325
i mean we really have to be a little bit more sophisticated – we’ve had – %$* 325
let me just mention to you, you're mentioning – %$* 326
good discussion now on this question and i think we do need to move to the next – %$* 321
no but this is very important judy. %$* 326
we can get each of you – %$* 321
i think it’s important because they keep raising this issue of – %$* 326
well – %$* 321
being pharmacists and doctors. %$* 326
yes. %$* 325
and all that, let me tell you – %$* 326
just because you're a pharmacist – %$* 322
there are millions – %$* 326
doesn’t mean you're not a terrorist. %$* 322
there are millions of engineers and doctors. %$* 326
osama bin laden is a civil engineer, come on. %$* 322
and professors and musicians in the thirties who voted for the %$* 322
nazi party which brought on the holocaust. %$* 326
i think that’s an unfair – with doctors – %$* 325
lawyers, pharmacists. %$* 322
professors – %$* 326
and the guy who – president of the united states, it begs the question. %$* 323
and what they believe in, this is what should be the yardstick. %$* 326
alright. %$* 326
not their diplomas. %$* 326
as long as the iranians and syrians tell them what to do, is that correct? %$* 323
we are going - %$* 321
as long as the iranians the syrians tell them %$* 323
we are not going to resolve this now, we need to let the next person have a question. %$* 321
yes, i believe, yes sir, you’ve been patiently waiting. %$* 321
hi, my question is for the against side, specifically for the gentleman who have had direct conversations with hamas. %$* 32
if hamas refuses to recognize israel, how can the organization support a two-state solution? %$* 32
well long before there was hamas, you know you got to, governments say things all the time. %$* 323
people say things all the time. %$* 323
if hamas tomorrow said, we recognize the state of israel or the right of israel to exist, the ambassador would say prove it. %$* 323
come back to us in twenty years, when you’ve shown we’ll accept it for twenty years. %$* 323
the reality of it is, i'm not concerned about what people say they will do, i'm more concerned about what in fact they do, do, and on the ground. %$* 323
the reality of it is that you’ve got statements that have come as close as they’re going to come. %$* 323
that talk about if we go back to the sixty-seven borders, that is the starting point and that’s where we’re going to move. %$* 323
everyday the united states government makes statements. %$* 323
there’s weapons of mass destruction, we go in through iraq. %$* 323
you know what, no weapons of mass destruction. %$* 323
don’t get hung up on the rhetoric of labels, don’t get hung up on we recognize your right to exist. %$* 323
what about recognizing the right of return? %$* 323
stanley cohen can go home, but if my name is mahmoud, i can’t go home. %$* 323
so you have to be reciprocal. %$* 323
i haven’t heard a word from israel about the right of return, i haven’t heard a word from israel about the right to a government, i haven’t heard a word from israel about the right to recognize what the palestinian people want. %$* 323
you’ll hear it pretty soon from me - %$* 326
we want unilateral concessions. %$* 323
can i, can i answer to that? %$* 326
well don’t judge us and don’t tell me what israel will say for twenty more years. %$* 326
just judge us by our deeds. %$* 326
when egypt was ready to recognize israel, we signed a peace treaty, the same with jordan, the same with the plo, and i take issue, i think it’s incorrect what you mentioned here. %$* 326
israel was ready to recognize the plo and talk to them only and only after yitzhak rabin received a letter signed by yasser arafat, ninth of september, ’93, which renounced terror, which recognized israel’s right to exist, and which also promised to change this charter that you were talking about. %$* 326
this is exactly what we’re expecting from hamas. %$* 326
and this is not just an israeli expectation, this is a demand by the entire international community as was expressed by the quartet, the four parties that are responsible for the peace process in the middle east. %$* 326
which called for the hamas after they were elected, they said okay, you were elected, it doesn’t matter if it was democratically or not, it doesn’t matter if you're a terror organization, lets look and move forward. %$* 326
and israel is in that camp, lets look and move forward, not about what you did, the fact that you already fired qassam rockets this morning, killing a baby in sderot. %$* 326
lets look to the future and we still say, if you renounce terror, if you recognize israel’s right to exist and you abolish your charter. %$* 326
and now also if you accept our previous agreements which were signed by the plo, then you are a le-, legitimate parter, partner. %$* 326
but they’re not doing that because they’re still a terror organization, because they do not believe in coexistence and they do believe not in building a nation but destroying one, which is ours. %$* 326
and we are not going to let them do that. %$* 326
you're talking about, stanley cohen, about the right of return. %$* 326
what kind of right of return? %$* 326
there’s no right of return. %$* 326
there are, there were arabs there which we wanted to coexist with them, but they refused - %$* 326
it’s all, it’s all, it’s all a conspiracy between iran and syria. %$* 323
eight hundred thousand people just woke up and moved. %$* 323
just read, just read the history, just read the history and then you will know, there is not such a thing as right of return. %$* 326
there is a problem of the refugees, this is true. %$* 326
there is a refugee problem, but the responsibility for the refugee problems lie on the heads of the leaders of the palestinians and of the arabs. %$* 326
alright. %$* 326
we have a question, i see a hand right there. %$* 321
my name is michael brown, i'm a freelance writer. %$* 329
there’s something that seems very myopic about this conversation with the war raging in iran and, and lebanon. %$* 329
this, this sort of insoluble binary seems to have spread to the whole world in terms of who’s a terrorist, who’s a democrat, who’s right and who’s wrong. %$* 329
you hear repeatedly that the key to peace of a region and the world is in the israel-palestine conflict. %$* 329
this is for anyone in the panel, if you still think that that’s true. %$* 329
for anyone on the panel. %$* 321
yeah. %$* 321
alright we’ll, we’ll begin with this side because we heard last. %$* 321

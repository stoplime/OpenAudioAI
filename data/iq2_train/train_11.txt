okay, ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to begin in about one minute. %$* 13
if you could take your seats quickly. %$* 13
thanks. %$* 13
all right, let’s begin. %$* 13
i’d like to begin the evening first by introducing the chairman of intelligence squared u.s., mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well thank you all very much. %$* 1
i see a lot of new faces. %$* 1
and i think the buzz at the cocktail hour was about as buzzy as we’ve ever seen. %$* 1
so thank you all for being here and braving the weather. %$* 1
the language of tonight’s resolution, i think i might have done it a little differently had i known about the bernie madoff scandal. %$* 1
but the art world does have its share of forgeries and its share of dealers who fake provenances and its instances where things are stolen from consignors. %$* 1
so there are bad apples in every basket. %$* 1
but that’s not really the thing that interests us and why we picked the language of this debate. %$* 1
it’s really the ethical issues revolving around two ideas. %$* 1
and one idea is secrecy and the other idea is manipulation. %$* 1
when you buy a work of art at auction it seems like a very open process. %$* 1
but there are a lot of secrets. %$* 1
you don’t know what the reserve is. %$* 1
you don’t necessarily know the source or the meaning of the estimates that are attached. %$* 1
there’s no real disclosure about guarantees. %$* 1
if the auction house has made a deal with favored third parties, you don’t know about that. %$* 1
what’s described as a buyer’s premium is sometimes rebated to the seller or used for other purposes. %$* 1
again, pretty obscure, a lot of secrets in that process. %$* 1
and the second element, i’d say, is market manipulation. %$* 1
as an example, the graphic symbol we used for tonight’s debate was damien hirst’s skull encrusted in diamonds. %$* 1
that was widely publicized to have sold for a hundred million dollars, which i believe is the highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist. %$* 1
well, it turned out subsequently that the purchaser was none other than damien hirst and his dealer to the tune of at least fifty per cent of the syndicate that was buying it – and who knows how much in reality. %$* 1
in the recent auction of damien hirst’s work he or his dealer was a buyer of a lot of key lots. %$* 1
and another example is the warhol market, which is dominated by a family called mugrabi – textile merchants from columbia, who own eight hundred warhols and are prominent buyers of all of the prime examples that they bid up at auction. %$* 1
so it’s also very common practice for dealers to bid up the auction prices of works of art by artists in their stables. %$* 1
but dealers get very angry at clients who sell at auctions – often blacklisting those clients. %$* 1
so i’d like now to turn back to the stock market. %$* 1
in the 1920s there were syndicates of sophisticated investors who would quietly accumulate stock and would then sell the stock back and forth to each other at ever increasing prices in order to give the unsuspecting public the sense that there was an ebullient and lively market. %$* 1
when the public came in the insiders would quietly sell. %$* 1
well, that conduct became illegal and it’s been illegal for the last sixty or seventy years. %$* 1
and in a way, when the art market is advertising prices at auction that are not real, that are intended really to deceive people about the true state of the market, that’s a very similar kind of manipulation. %$* 1
the questions for tonight are, how endemic is that? %$* 1
how common is it? %$* 1
should those kind of practices be illegal? %$* 1
and finally, does the art market operate in a generalized sense with high ethical standards or not? %$* 1
and we have a very, very distinguished panel. %$* 1
and it’s now my pleasure to turn the evening back to john donvan. %$* 1
thank you. %$* 13
and may i invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz, who makes these evenings possible? %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another intelligence squared u.s.debate from the caspary auditorium at the rockefeller university. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your host and moderator. %$* 13
and the motion before us tonight is this: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
we have six panelists, all from the new york and london art world. %$* 13
we know that we have many members of the new york and london art world in the audience tonight as well, which makes for an even more interesting evening because this debate actually is a contest. %$* 13
it is a contest of wit and logic and ideas and facts and argument, and most of all, persuasion. %$* 13
the six panelists are here to persuade to their point of view on our motion, which i will state once again: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
in the course of the evening you will hear from the panelists in three rounds. %$* 13
in the opening round each side will speak alternately for seven minutes apiece. %$* 13
there will be no interruptions. %$* 13
they have clocks that tell them when their time is up. %$* 13
if they exceed that time i will step in and pull reins on them. %$* 13
after that we will have about a forty minute section where the debaters actually will debate head to head. %$* 13
and that will be mixed up somewhat with questions from me and also questions from you, the audience. %$* 13
and as i asked you earlier, when you ask questions please really think in terms of crafting a question. %$* 13
it is a challenge, it is an artistic challenge. %$* 13
and the signature to a question is a question mark at the end of the statement. %$* 13
and finally, each of the panelists at the end of the evening will be able to sum up for two minutes and at that point we will find out who the winner is. %$* 13
now, what we’re gonna ask you to do, we’re going to poll you twice during this evening – once now as you come in off the street to see where you stand on the motion, and once again at the end of the evening so that we can see how many minds were changed. %$* 13
so if you turn now to the keypads that are at your seats – and i explained this earlier, but for the new arrivals, there are a series of buttons. %$* 13
please pay attention only to buttons number one, two and three. %$* 13
those are the ones you need to register your opinion on this motion. %$* 13
the motion again: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
push number one if you agree, number two if you disagree and number three if you remain undecided. %$* 13
if you think that you’ve pushed the wrong button just correct yourself and our system will record only your last entry. %$* 13
and i’ll give you about another fifteen seconds to record that. %$* 13
does anyone need more time? %$* 13
okay, we’re locking that down. %$* 13
and in a little while i’ll be reporting those early results and then that’ll tell us what the stakes are this evening. %$* 13
so let’s let the debate again. %$* 13
our topic is: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
arguing first for the motion is richard feigen, president and founder of richard l.feigen and company, art dealers. %$* 13
he opened his first gallery in new york city in 1963, which in a sense gives him more experience in the art world than perhaps anyone else in this room – time enough to know what he likes and also to decide what he does not like, particularly before us tonight in the category of ethical behavior in the art market. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard feigen. %$* 13
thank you very much and thanks to everybody for having this forum. %$* 165
it’s very interesting. %$* 165
and thanks to all of you for coming. %$* 165
the first premise that i want to propose is that the art market is a financial market now. %$* 165
it has become this and it is a totally unregulated financial market. %$* 165
i will also try to define ethical. %$* 165
i define ethical as a protection for the investor or art collector and unethical as efforts to deceive. %$* 165
i will narrowly define the stock market as publicly traded equities. %$* 165
otherwise i risk sailing off into bernie madoff-land and uncharted waters. %$* 165
the art market really is divided into two parts – the private art market, meaning the galleries, and the public market, the auction houses. %$* 165
in the private market there are protections of the purchaser in the form of the uniform commercial code in new york and the self-policing bodies like the art dealers association of america. %$* 165
so i’m gonna foc. %$* 165
these are not totally protective but they serve a purpose. %$* 165
i’m gonna focus then on the auction market. %$* 165
the press usually defines the art market as the auction market for contemporary art, which gets all the press – where prices have ballooned in recent years. %$* 165
and therefore it has become press- worthy, because big prices make for press. %$* 165
in the past few years there has been rampant speculation. %$* 165
until the middle-nineties a work that appeared at auction, if it reappeared within five years it would be virtually unsellable. %$* 165
and now works appear almost immediately after being purchased or at least they did until the recent unpleasantness in the contemporary market, starting in november. %$* 165
and because there’s a new wave of speculators at each auction. %$* 165
this all really began in the middle-eighties, when art became monetized by the press and the financial institutions into a financial market, sotheby’s launched a financial services arm, citibank an art advisory department and so on. %$* 165
banks lent money on art and auction houses lent money to buy art. %$* 165
sotheby’s chairman went to jail for colluding with christie’s on auction commissions. %$* 165
now art had become a serious financial asset. %$* 165
whereas before the eighties the market was tiny, it now became global. %$* 165
thousands of people became involved. %$* 165
billions of dollars changed hands. %$* 165
but except for foreign governments claiming repatriation of antiquities and holocaust restitutions and despite the sums of money involved and vast numbers of participants, government seems to treat art as frivolous, as a luxury market with no regulation or oversight. %$* 165
as just one example: in the bush administration tax code, when the capital gains tax was reduced from twenty-eight per cent to fifteen per cent art remained at twenty-eight per cent – apparently because it was treated by the government as a luxury, not an asset class. %$* 165
the stock markets are highly regulated by law. %$* 165
there are also protections for individuals who trade in the market through fiduciary, mutual funds and so on. %$* 165
regulation came about as a protection for individual investors. %$* 165
the art market, on the other hand, is totally unregulated. %$* 165
things occur, particularly in the auction market, that are deliberately contrived to deceive the unsophisticated individual and that would be subject to criminal penalties in the stock market. %$* 165
the most universally encountered is chandelier bidding, which means fake bids to entice bidders into competition. %$* 165
whereas regulations exist in the stock market to provide transparency, chandelier bidding is specifically designed to deceive, to imply that there is competition when there isn’t any. %$* 165
novice buyers usually enter the market through auctions because they have no other way to establish values. %$* 165
and unlike securities, there are no two works of art that are identical or are in the same condition or have the same credentials. %$* 165
the only source of price comparison is auction data bases. %$* 165
but, again, comparisons are flawed. %$* 165
the novice auction bidder believes his only exposure is his incremental bid. %$* 165
he assumes that the under-bid represents a willing and able competitor. %$* 165
but if there wasn’t any under-bidder? %$* 165
what if the bid was a phantom, a chandelier bid? %$* 165
when some years ago the issue of chandelier bidding was raised in new york’s consumer affairs department, the auctioneers cried that to eliminate it would take the drama out of auctions and they threatened to quit new york city. %$* 165
when i was quoted as saying that when i want drama i go to broadway i was called a horse’s butt. %$* 165
the only – i changed that word because my wife wouldn’t let me, or somebody in my office wouldn’t let me use it. %$* 165
the only result of this city inquiry was that the auctioneers were forced to identify items in which they have a financial interest or that are guaranteed or most recently in which there are irrevocable bids identified by miniscule symbols virtually invisible or incomprehensible to all but professionals. %$* 165
otherwise, the auctioneers prevailed with their deceptive practices. %$* 165
in addition, the auction catalog disclaimers make it basically caveat emptor, as far as authenticity and condition are concerned. %$* 165
in the private gallery market the invoice establishes the guarantee, by law. %$* 165
the real reason for the auctioneer’s ethical ambivalence is the dramatic shift in role over the last forty years from agent for the buyer. %$* 165
then as demand started exceeding supply, first as agent for both buyers and sellers and then primarily for the sellers, the buyer paying almost all of the commission guarantees and irrevocable bids followed swiftly as further enticements to sellers. %$* 165
but the auctioneer’s role remained ambiguous. %$* 165
the auctioneer was now wearing at least two invisible hats and when he had an equity in the object, three. %$* 165
richard, i have to interrupt you. %$* 13
your time is up. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, richard feigen. %$* 13
our next debater has arguably already earned his place in art history. %$* 13
chuck close’s paintings are in the collections of the national gallery of art in washington, the tate in london, the museum of modern art here in new york. %$* 13
and while he has been known to spend months, even more than a year, on a single painting tonight we are giving him minutes to argue against the motion, that: the art market is less ethical than the stock market. %$* 13
well, it doesn’t seem like we have to do much, given what’s happened recently. %$* 166
but, my argument is a little different. %$* 166
i don’t think that the value of art is determined by money at all. %$* 166
and i – i don’t think that the value of art is measured in that way. %$* 166
if you look at the turn of the century, bugaro sold for far more than any other artist, in what would be in today’s terms, millions of dollars. %$* 166
and the artists that we now know and love, the impressionists, post- impressionists, couldn’t sell their work at all. %$* 166
so i question whether sales really is a barometer of value and whether ethics has anything to do with how that work is marketed. %$* 166
we have examples of the work being marketed extremely well, with great ethics. %$* 166
and we have examples of it being done in a somewhat sleazier fashion. %$* 166
i would say that art is not a business. %$* 166
certainly the making of art is not a business. %$* 166
my good friend joe zucker, who is a great painter, his father was a junk dealer, a scrap metal dealer in chicago. %$* 166
when he looked at joe’s studio and saw the racks full of unsold paintings, he said, you can’t afford to make any more paintings until you get rid of some of your inventory. %$* 166
if any of us made work for that kind of reason, you know, you wonder where we would be. %$* 166
i remember lee marvin in the ship of fools was a washed-up baseball player. %$* 166
and he’s standing at a bar, talking to an artist. %$* 166
and, because he isn’t being paid, he doesn’t play baseball anymore. %$* 166
and the artist is trying to explain to him why he has to have an occupation to support his profession. %$* 166
and that’s really where the art world is at. %$* 166
most people, most artists make this work whether anybody wants it all, makes it year in and year out with little visibility, no critical attention and little financial support. %$* 166
most artists, by nature, are mediocre. %$* 166
there are no undiscovered geniuses. %$* 166
take my word. %$* 166
there are no undiscovered geniuses. %$* 166
there are many undiscovered competent artists, just as competent as the artists who are famous and we all know. %$* 166
there are no charlatans. %$* 166
if somebody wanted to be a charlatan the last thing they would do is go into art. %$* 166
there are many other ways. %$* 166
and i think the financial market is obviously a much better place to be a charlatan than being an artist. %$* 166
if you’re lucky enough to find a dealer, the artist and the dealer relationship is the heart and soul of the art world. %$* 166
it is a marriage. %$* 166
like many marriages, some don’t last forever and there may even be some cheating from time to time. %$* 166
but it is a marriage because this is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to art and how it is offered to the public. %$* 166
there are ups and downs. %$* 166
things are in fashion or out, hot or not. %$* 166
and if you don’t understand the cyclical nature of the art world you’re in for a lot of pain. %$* 166
dave hickey said in a really wonderful article in, in art in america this month: at one time a consensus of professional respect would carry an artist through times of no money better than money would carry an artist through times of no professional respect. %$* 166
a few museum shows and a nice catalog essay during a lull meant that your prices would still be there when fashion changed and the money came back. %$* 166
he went on to say that works of art have no intrinsic value. %$* 166
all their value is extrinsic. %$* 166
it is invested from without and over a period of time. %$* 166
damien hirst’s jewel encrusted skull has hundreds of thousands of dollars – or it might be millions, i don’t know – of diamonds in it. %$* 166
it did not make that piece any more valuable than any other work of his, just because it had inherent value. %$* 166
i’ve got two minutes. %$* 166
jesus christ. %$* 166
so who are the deciders? %$* 166
some are forces for good. %$* 166
i’m borrowing a phrase from bush on purpose. %$* 166
who are the deciders? %$* 166
some of those deciders are forces for good and some are forces for evil. %$* 166
i'm not even gonna get into it. %$* 166
oy. %$* 166
i’ll do this in my closing remarks. %$* 166
i-- %$* 166
well, i’ve got two minutes. %$* 166
no, one more minute. %$* 166
no, i-- %$* 166
i would just repeat that the most important thing is the value that art-- %$* 166
art is a meritocracy. %$* 166
it is a meritocracy because the final arbiters of what is important are other artists. %$* 166
all the hype, all the spin, all the effort to construct a career out of thin air, all the efforts to manipulate the market notwithstanding, over the long haul if you don’t have the respect of other artists it will disappear and it will not stand the test of time. %$* 166
so if we’re looking at short term investment, perhaps it can be manipulated and perhaps it’s not always the most perfectly run organiza-- %$* 166
opportunity. %$* 166
but over the long haul it’s left up to other artists. %$* 166
and i think that’s what finally determines the value in art. %$* 166
do you want to yield the rest of your time to the evening? %$* 13
well, i’ve got two minutes. %$* 166
no, one more minute. %$* 166
no, i-- %$* 166
no, take it. %$* 13
i would just repeat that the most important thing is the value that art-- %$* 166
art is a meritocracy. %$* 166
it is a meritocracy because the final arbiters of what is important are other artists. %$* 166
all the hype, all the spin, all the effort to construct a career out of thin air, all the efforts to manipulate the market notwithstanding, over the long haul if you don’t have the respect of other artists it will disappear and it will not stand the test of time. %$* 166
so if we’re looking at short term investment, perhaps it can be manipulated and perhaps it’s not always the most perfectly run organiza-- %$* 166
opportunity. %$* 166
but over the long haul it’s left up to other artists. %$* 166
and i think that’s what finally determines the value in art. %$* 166
thank you, chuck close. %$* 13
our next debater, michael hue- williams, is founder of the albion gallery, located in london and new york. %$* 13
and as we are debating here, london is snowed in. %$* 13
both runways at heathrow are shut down and somehow michael managed to get what might have been the last plane out. %$* 13
he stepped off of it about three hours ago. %$* 13
so he obviously wanted to argue tonight. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, michael hue-williams. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 167
i’m going to make some points to support what richard’s already begun on our behalf. %$* 167
and these will be made more in the way that a drunk might use a lamppost-- %$* 167
in support rather than illumination. %$* 167
however, an early statement from 1932, pre-regulation of the stock market, which fdr managed, importantly, to begin over here, began with the remarks that it was needed because of shocking disclosures of low standards in high places. %$* 167
this possibly is something that could be applied to the art market, i fear. %$* 167
the stock market in london has a dictum. %$* 167
the dictum is: meum dictum pactum. %$* 167
this means, my word is my bond. %$* 167
and it is one of the important maxims in the art world, but unfortunately, it is not one that necessarily is worth banking upon. %$* 167
i’m gonna illustrate three reasons why the motion: the art market is less ethical than the stock market, for me, holds water. %$* 167
the first is that there is no real regulation. %$* 167
the second, that there is no transparency in the market, and the third, that there are absolutely no barriers to entry. %$* 167
the first, no real regulation – let me explain by telling you a story against myself. %$* 167
in 1989 and 1990 – it’s a long time ago – i was in short trousers. %$* 167
i had a gallery in london already. %$* 167
i came to new york on the day of one of the big auctions. %$* 167
and i made a deal with an art dealer here in new york – somebody who is extremely prominent to this day – to buy eight paintings by the german painter, george baselitz – an artist who i still greatly admire. %$* 167
and i agreed to buy these for 2.4 million dollars, which at the time seemed an extraordinary amount of money to me. %$* 167
i think i was twenty-four years old at the time. %$* 167
and i left the gallery of this man i’d made the deal with. %$* 167
and i waited because there was one similar painting that night in auction in new york. %$* 167
and the painting made eight hundred thousand dollars. %$* 167
i went to bed that night feeling very clever. %$* 167
the next morning i got a telephone call from the dealer, who told me that the deal did not stand and that he was gonna walk away from it. %$* 167
and of course i was outraged. %$* 167
but under the ucc regulations, anything that is not written on paper and is a transaction above five hundred dollars is not enforceable. %$* 167
clearly here, ethics and the law were not working hand in hand. %$* 167
ethically, i felt he was doing something that was appalling. %$* 167
legally, he was absolutely right, he could do it. %$* 167
that illustrates my first point, that there is no real regulation. %$* 167
the second point that there is no transparency in the market has been touched upon by richard, in his remarks about the auction houses and the creation of rings. %$* 167
rings are %$* 167
relatively simple to create, it needs a group of people who stand outside the framework of the auction houses, and they decide to promote an artist, it’s very easily done with a young artist, and i can think of one at the moment in the middle east who is an interesting young painter whose work has rocketed in price, from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the space of less than two years. %$* 167
a group of people bought a lot of pictures, they each owned individually, group of pictures, and they started to put these pictures into auction, they then go to the auctions, they get groups of people bid them up, and thereby they feather their own nests. %$* 167
and %$* 167
this draws attention of the press, the press attention to the artist, and it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy that this artist starts to go up in value, and by a process of osmosis, the ring benefit from the auction house activity that they’ve begun. %$* 167
this is not transparent to the outside viewer, but to art world professionals, it is quite obvious when this is happening. %$* 167
the last point, and possibly the most important point, is that, unlike the stock market %$* 167
there are no barriers to entry. %$* 167
to become an art dealer, you need to have a pulse. %$* 167
you need to be able to count %$* 167
and probably you need two eyes in your head. %$* 167
but beyond that anybody can be and call themselves an art dealer. %$* 167
there was an extraordinary scenario that took place here, predominantly here in new york, with an art dealer, so-called, called michael cohen, some of you may know about this but i’m going to use him as an example of an extraordinary situation, where he began to trade in commodities, and in the stock market, and ran into a lot of financial trouble. %$* 167
this was not his business, this was what he was making money doing on the side. %$* 167
but he realized that he could solve his problems, where there was an absolute call on his money at 30 days, and he had to deliver, by using other people’s paintings as collateral. %$* 167
some of them, he parked even in the auction houses, his level of chutzpah has to be seen to be believed, he actually managed to sell a titian that was on the wall of the met. %$* 167
in any case, this gentleman eventually did become unseated. %$* 167
and he has disappeared, last sighted in brazil. %$* 167
and if anybody can help us out with his whereabouts, jerry saltz, our resident investigative journalist would love to write a story all about it. %$* 167
i use him as an example, there are very clear demands placed upon people, who go into the stock market, the stock market is regulated, these individuals are fingerprinted, they are members of a licensed body of people who are allowed to trade. %$* 167
their backgrounds are heavily investigated before they begin. %$* 167
this is not the case with the art world. %$* 167
and for these three reasons, there is no regulation, no transparency, and no barriers to entry. %$* 167
these are the reasons that i believe absolutely, that the motion, the art market is less ethical than the stock market, cannot be disputed. %$* 167
thank you, michael hue-williams. %$* 13
amy cappellazzo is deputy chairman and international co-head of post-war and contemporary art at christie’s, and she became famous for a quote, something she said a year or two back when describing a rather frothy art market. %$* 13
she said, “after you have a fourth home and a gulfstream jet, what is there.” it has been picked up and repeated, and repeated and repeated and our next debater is amy cappellazzo. %$* 13
thank you, john. %$* 168
well, this is such a juicy topic, i really don’t even know where to begin, my notes feel, you know, my head is flooding with all sorts of other ideas besides these, that i’ve put before myself on these pieces of paper today. %$* 168
certainly i’d like to just say that when you’re on a panel it’s much more interesting to sit on one than sit through one, so i will, you know, work very hard to play to type and make it lively and interesting and there’ve been many swipes against auction house people tonight and as i am the auction house person on this panel, i will get to sort of support and defend the position and place of the auction house as sort an ethical player, but %$* 168
in reading the proposition over and over again, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market,” of course i had to read this multiple times and i had to analyze every word. %$* 168
certainly colonizing the word “ethical” will help make you the winner tonight. %$* 168
and, something ethical is described as “proper conduct and good living.” an essential aspect of ethics is the concept of the life worth living, that each of us aspires to this quality of life and aspires to have the kind of life that allows us to sleep at night and lead an ethical, good life that makes it all worth living. %$* 168
a few things basically need to be established here. %$* 168
art is not a pure commodity, it’s not an ordinary commodity. %$* 168
while it certainly is bought and sold and traded, the motivations for the place of art in our society, the motivations for its existence and everyone who plays within the game of the art world, are incredibly conflicting in fact. %$* 168
my premise depends on the concept that the art market does not exist without the art world. %$* 168
that in fact the art world adds hugely to the conscience of the art market. %$* 168
what do i mean by the art world, i mean the entire museum profession, critics, curators, conservators, other sorts of people in the cultural production business, writers, graphic designers who work with artists, etcetera. %$* 168
art is valuable emotionally, intellectually, historically, in a way that other commodities are not inherently. %$* 168
the motivations for becoming part of the art world are too multiple and varied, the rewards are too varied among the various groups, an artist becomes part of the art world for a completely different set of reasons, than a dealer does, than a critic does. %$* 168
so while there is—in the art world there are too many different rewards, the reward structure is fractured and varied. %$* 168
whereas in the stock market, presumably there is a singular reward which is financial compensation. %$* 168
within that, there is not really an ability for ethical behavior to— it’s hard to get into ethical run-ins because everybody has a completely different system of reward and a completely different reason for existing within that. %$* 168
part of what i put forth here is that art is a bit like physics, it can exist both as wave and as particle, so it is at once something that is bought, sold, traded as a commodity, or as something like a commodity, and it exists in this sort of higher place, of emotional, intellectual, historical, and cultural meaning and cultural relevance. %$* 168
i believe that there’s something that exists in the art world, that exists in the art market, that makes it completely different from the stock market, and that is something that i would call, pressure of a common pool, which is a sort of basic, economics 101 theory, an idea that things that are precious in the public domain that no one exactly owns, let’s say like aquifers, groundwater, forests, fisheries, things of this kind, are in fact, there’s a kind of rule of conduct about how people engage within them which is essentially %$* 168
more or less ethical. %$* 168
people who do not behave well within these common public treasures are in fact outliers or criminals and are really quickly rooted out, and that those of us who participate in this pressure of a common pool participate ethically and carefully. %$* 168
i believe works of art are something that give us tremendous pleasure. %$* 168
they really, you know, all the beautiful platitudes about feeding our soul and carrying us through difficult times, all of this is entirely true, particularly now, and that we all treat works of art in the same coveted fashion with care, respect, and preciousness that works of art deserve. %$* 168
if you break these rules of engagement you are a criminal or an outlier. %$* 168
people who know art, people who collect it, artists who make it, collectors who very much covet it, really know that they are only temporary custodians of works of art, it’s kind of like being a foster parent, you don’t really own these works of art, you just take care of them for a while because they’re supposed to outlive you. %$* 168
and you’re supposed to pass them on to someone else. %$* 168
so as long as that is the ethos that surrounds a work of art, how this object is understood in the world and in the marketplace will always be different than something that trades as pure commodity. %$* 168
so, with the position that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, the art world is by far more ethical than the stock market. %$* 168
it has a conflicting set of—has a very varied and various, numerous reward system among its various participants, as opposed to the singularity of money that comes from the stock market. %$* 168
and the actual object traded is very different than a share of stock in all of its principles, properties, ideas, and values. %$* 168
and that is why i am arguing against this proposition tonight. %$* 168
thank you. %$* 168
thank you, amy cappellazzo. %$* 13
so i just want to remind you where we are in the evening, we are now at this point halfway through our opening round. %$* 13
i’m john donvan, your host and moderator, and this is intelligence squared us, oxford-style debating on america’s shores. %$* 13
we have six panelists, three who are arguing for and three against this proposition, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market.” and now we are going to move on, our next panelist will be arguing for the motion, “the art market is less ethical than the stock market.” adam lindemann is one of the world’s leading collectors of contemporary art, he likes to share what he knows, he’s written essentially a buyer’s guide for collectors, and he also likes to buy what he likes. %$* 13
he calls himself a consumptaholic. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, adam lindemann. %$* 13
thanks so much. %$* 169
i just wanted to remind you all that march 17th is “blame washington more than wall street.” i do blame washington. %$* 169
april 21, “it’s wrong to pay for sex,” i do think it’s wrong to pay for sex. %$* 169
unless you get a good deal. %$* 169
and may 12th, “diplomacy with iran is going nowhere” and it is, so, that gives you a hint of where i stand here, i’m here to basically argue the point that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, which it is. %$* 169
i want to start off by reminding you all what “ethical” actually means, ‘cause i wasn’t even sure what it meant when i thought about it. %$* 169
“ethical” means “being in accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct,” ethics means this is correct and right conduct and practice. %$* 169
the standards of a profession, and this is the standards of the profession of the art dealer we’re talking about. %$* 169
an example here is, it was not considered ethical for physicians to advertise. %$* 169
it is not ethical for physicians to advertise, i thought well why can’t physicians advertise if they’re good. %$* 169
and the reason is physicians are there to help people. %$* 169
physicians are supposed to help you with your health. %$* 169
and therefore it’s not really a business. %$* 169
just like the art market is not really a business but then how can it be a market and not be a business? %$* 169
we get into this whole %$* 169
ethical question, about art and the market, these two things are really at loggerheads in a way. %$* 169
and i thought, do art dealers advertise. %$* 169
because it would not be appropriate for physicians to advertise. %$* 169
do art dealers advertise, and i thought, every art dealer i know, advertised heavily. %$* 169
as a matter of fact, auction houses advertise, everyone advertises, and therefore, it immediately made me feel well perhaps, advertising is a sign that this is a business and not simply about %$* 169
ethics and proper conduct. %$* 169
now, in terms of the stock market, the sec regulates public companies. %$* 169
and the reason for that, is really to protect the public. %$* 169
if it weren’t for protecting the public, in fact the government would let everyone do whatever they wanted to do with public companies, private companies and whatnot. %$* 169
we have many, many rules and regulations for the financial markets and of course more rules to break, is what many people will think, or more rules to skirt. %$* 169
but the reality is that those rules are there. %$* 169
now on the other hand, we have works of art, which are inherently unique. %$* 169
each work of art is quite different. %$* 169
even if there is a degas which sold today for $19 million, that degas is one of i believe 20 that he made and that particular degas was cast after his death, that’s what we call a posthumous cast, so, in my view that degas is quite different from a cast that degas made during his lifetime. %$* 169
how could we regulate degas’s danseuse, even if two were exactly the same. %$* 169
the skirt is going to be slightly different, the patina was slightly different. %$* 169
one of them got dropped on the floor and restored, the other one didn’t. %$* 169
so therefore, since art is inherently, each work of art is inherently unique, it’s extremely difficult to regulate. %$* 169
so i was trying to imagine how we would regulate the art world in order to make it truly ethical. %$* 169
and i was thinking we would have to create something called the aec, as opposed to the sec we would have the aec which is the art exchange commission. %$* 169
this would be a counterpart to the sec, perhaps a subdivision, in which case we could go after madoff and we could also go after art dealers who have sold things that are not correct. %$* 169
i think that that whole idea of regulating the art world is in and of itself impossible. %$* 169
and so then i thought, well, what are these standards for proper conduct. %$* 169
how can we be proper, how can we be ethical, in the art market. %$* 169
and i quickly thought of six fast reasons which make it difficult to ensure that every trade in the art market will be ethical. %$* 169
the %$* 169
of course, many of the dealers and many of the people at the auction houses and many of the artists are my dear friends, and i don’t mean to say that any of them are unethical. %$* 169
my point is rather that the art market itself is ripe for unethical behavior. %$* 169
that doesn’t mean that the participants in it are unethical. %$* 169
my personal feeling is that the people in the art world that i know are the most wonderful and ethical people i know in any environment, in any business. %$* 169
but that being said, the entire market is ripe for anything to happen. %$* 169
for example. %$* 169
stocks, when stocks trade, you pay a commission. %$* 169
you can pay between one and 15 cents, you like the guy, you pay 15 cents, he’s given you good information, you can pay 50 cents, you can give him a dollar. %$* 169
you can trade with charles schwab. %$* 169
you—it’s a penny a share. %$* 169
when you’re buying a work of art, you have no idea what that real commission is. %$* 169
the art market is all fair game, it’s caveat emptor. %$* 169
unless you’re going in with a dealer that you know, or a work of art that you know or you have a consultant who you trust, you have no idea what the commission is. %$* 169
you don’t know if it’s 10 percent, 15 percent, yes, common practice is 10 percent. %$* 169
common practice in the art world, 10 percent commission. %$* 169
my question to you is, 10 percent of what. %$* 169
the next point which i think is pretty much going to blow this up, is the insider trading. %$* 169
now, you know that insider trading is wrong when you’re trading public securities. %$* 169
matter of fact insider training is wrong when you’re trading bonds, when you’re trading stocks. %$* 169
now, you know, it’s illegal on wall street and the reality is in the art market, we live on inside information. %$* 169
i mean the whole art market is based on inside information, i mean that’s the whole idea of art. %$* 169
you know, there are the insiders and then there are the outsiders. %$* 169
yes, there’s the concept that art is for everyone and art will transcend, and we all want that feeling, i mean, certainly we want the art that’s going to speak to everyone. %$* 169
however, the reality is, when you’re actually buying art, when you’re a collector, when you’re reaching into your pocket and you need to spend money, you want to know everything, at least i do. %$* 169
it’s not only about love, of course i love, but, i can’t buy everything in the world. %$* 169
so i need to choose what i’m gonna do with my resources and i wanna have all that information, especially the inside information that i know that dealer has. %$* 169
another type of inside information would be if a young artist is going to a big gallery. %$* 169
this is a critical thing to know. %$* 169
the other thing is opportunities for currency exchanges. %$* 169
geographic. %$* 169
a painting in one country is worth less than a painting in another country. %$* 169
does that make dealers unethical? %$* 169
absolutely not. %$* 169
but the whole system is ripe for anything to happen, and that’s the beauty of art, and the art market. %$* 169
thank you, adam lindemann. %$* 13
well, we felt we needed an art critic in the debate tonight, and we are fortunate to have jerry saltz who in artreview’s 2008 “power 100” list was ranked number 79 %$* 13
and his wife, roberta smith of the new york times, the art critic, was ranked number 71. jerry has said “new york city is not the center of the art world anymore, but it is the trading floor.” do you recall that? %$* 13
yes. %$* 170
i hope you stand by it as you argue against the motion, ladies and gentlemen, jerry saltz. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 170
thank you. %$* 170
first i wanna say, art is not optional. %$* 170
it’s always been here, since the beginning, it has never gone away, it’s not going away. %$* 170
okay? %$* 170
it isn’t just a decorative hedge that grows in front of a market, or in front of industry or philosophy. %$* 170
art is a necessity, okay? %$* 170
it changes the world, it won’t reduce the incidence of aids in sub-saharan africa but it does change the world incrementally, and/or by osmosis, okay? %$* 170
so when you keep talking about the market i want to say to my friends on the other side %$* 170
that almost there’s a self-hating thing to your argument to me. %$* 170
because, you are representatives of the market. %$* 170
and i have to remind you first of all, 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of artists actually make money. %$* 170
and even they barely do and usually only for a very short time. %$* 170
so while—and look at, their clothes are pretty good. %$* 170
and i’m not against-- %$* 170
mr. %$* 170
feigen just sold a painting for $12 million, that’s great, yesterday, and i think you deserve that. %$* 170
there’s nothing wrong with that. %$* 170
but when we’re standing here talking about secrecy and manipulation instead of sorcery or prestidigitation or you’re talking about, you’re upset because we’re not regulated. %$* 170
i don’t want us ever to be regulated. %$* 170
this is the art world %$* 170
people. %$* 170
am i yelling? %$* 170
this— if this were the industry, that side would be right. %$* 170
but this is the art world, and a world is a place that has a vision, that has problems. %$* 170
the market is a place obviously that people exhibit junkie-like behavior. %$* 170
millionaires try to enter art history by spending a lot of money. %$* 170

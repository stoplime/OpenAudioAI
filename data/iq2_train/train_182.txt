how many debaters do we have on—on the other side there. %$* 89
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- you talk about engagement. %$* 494
but, in the case of iran where the other side really has no interest in engagement, or north korea has no interest in engagement, i mean, we can be out there engaging all we want, and nobody’s accepting the ring. %$* 494
well i think the north korea and iran cases are a category that’s a little bit different than the requirement for a policeman, although michael mandelbaum put non-proliferation inn this basket that we’re talking about tonight. %$* 495
but both of those problems are being managed with, you know, international cooperation, and even if the united states had—didn’t want to engage initially with north korea, and still today with iran, the reality is we have found interlocutors to engage with both. %$* 495
and the progress has been made in the six-party talks with north korea. %$* 495
i certainly agree with you that iran is in one of those, you know, very hard baskets, and engagement alone is not necessarily sufficient. %$* 495
there are circumstances in which coercive diplomacy, sanctions, there are other instruments of international politics that can be, can be exercised. %$* 495
but i would argue that at least under today’s circumstances, you know, iran is not, iran has many policies that we do not like, but it is not playing the role of a belligerent, that requires a military action right now. %$* 495
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- we will continue now with %$* 494
for the resolution, douglas murray. %$* 494
okay, thank you, thank you very much, it’s very good to be here. %$* 333
and thank you for listening to me, it’s good to be another brit here, partly, partly so that you don’t all think that brits think like matthew parris %$* 333
it’s an odd position to be in, perhaps some of you think to have somebody from another nation coming along to you here and saying, effectively, please police me %$* 333
a strange misquote of that wonderful thinker engelbert humperdinck %$* 333
but %$* 333
but it’s not quite as masochistic as it sounds when we talk about the world’s policeman, a lot of people assume up the idea of force, and that you have the right to do it because you’re powerful. %$* 333
i don’t think that is what the reason is, that america has the right to be and should continue to be as it currently is the world’s policeman. %$* 333
it’s not your force as a nation which i think allows you that right, it’s america’s virtues that allow it that right. %$* 333
it’s the fact that, when america goes into a country like afghanistan or iraq, you don’t do the things which previous great powers did, that the moment, if anything this is a failing, if anything, when you go into a country like iraq, you don’t say how long can we rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- stay here, but how soon can we get out. %$* 333
you want to dabble as little as possible in the world-- %$* 333
i think that’s a virtue. %$* 333
you know when you have to intervene. %$* 333
but you also know when you have to get out. %$* 333
but, uh, to clear up some of the mistakes from other side already, just because you’re the world’s policeman doesn’t mean you don’t have allies. %$* 333
it doesn’t mean you don’t have friends and others who will do the job, who’ll join you in the job. %$* 333
america in the last few years, despite the caricature of her greatest enemies, is not the unilateral organization that a lot of people would portray her as being. %$* 333
now, as my two colleagues and comrades on my side have already intimated to you, there are really only two reasons not to vote for the right side if i may, in this in this motion. %$* 333
the first is that you think that the world does need a policeman, but that someone else can do it. %$* 333
someone else will step up for the job. %$* 333
we’ve heard quite a lot at the moment, uh, from people talking more i think in glee than sorrow about the rise of china, for instance. %$* 333
you can look in your papers any day and see what the rise of china would bring in its wake if you wanted them to police the world, look at the athletes for instance going to the olympics, being, attempting to be forbidden from speaking out about any chinese abuses whilst they’re there. %$* 333
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- you want a perpetual silencing like that across the globe? %$* 333
you don’t see america trying to do that, you don’t see america trying to silence her enemies. %$* 333
america is the only force i can think of which tolerates people standing up against it, shouting as loudly as possible, picketing its military institutions and all this kind of thing permits that. %$* 333
think of another world power that would permit that kind of thing, or another policeman that wouldn’t object when people continue to rejoice in poking it in the eye. %$* 333
who else might be on the horizon? %$* 333
you might see, there’s a lot of talk for instance at the moment about saudi arabia. %$* 333
we have a lot of talk about that in britain at the moment with our archbishop of canterbury, or soon to be promoted to the grand mufti of canterbury. %$* 333
saying that he wouldn’t mind sharia law in britain, i was sitting opposite a clerical goon two mornings ago in london who was explaining to me, sheik sewit hassan what the sharia that he would like to bring to britain would be and that, yes, we should cut off hands, we should stone women to death, because it would teach the others, and he hadn’t seen any adultery in saudi arabia. %$* 333
and i pointed out you don’t actually often see adultery happening, but— but you might get those kind of global systems if you, if you wish rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- it hard enough, if you wish hard enough for america to fall, for america to be poked in the eye. %$* 333
but what will you do, who will sort out these problems, who will sort out a problem like iran, when you have years of talks and the only progress you’ll really hear of is iran getting closer and closer to its desired objectives of nuclear power. %$* 333
so that’s the first reason, the first reason why you would vote against this motion, the second, is that you think that the world doesn’t really need a policeman. %$* 333
it will be just fine without one. %$* 333
this, ladies and gentlemen, is, i think, a terrible, terrible illusion, it’s a siren call which has called across history to people. %$* 333
it called to the people of athens two and a half millennia ago when demosthenes warned them of the threat from king phillip and said you do have other people who will tell you, if you ignore this threat, you will save money, and you’ll be able to spend it on other things %$* 333
but, i know that if you listen to them, you will one day wake up, and you’ll realize how much this optimism cost you. %$* 333
you’re in the same position today, ladies and gentlemen. %$* 333
as people have been throughout history, as the person—the famous journalist who before the first world war wrote that, war in europe was now an impossibility, because it was so economically unviable. %$* 333
well it turned out to be more unviable for more reason than economics and people did it anyway. %$* 333
you will not be able to live rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- in a world in which no one acts as your policeman. %$* 333
and let me cite one example of where the virtue of american intervention has been cited already by max boot, is not only necessary but vital and i’d cite the case of kosovo. %$* 333
this might well come back again and again later. %$* 333
but, when the concentration camps in europe reopened in the 1990s in the balkans, and when we saw an ethnic genocide, an ethnic cleansing, from a third-rate tin-pot dictator and the european governments couldn’t stop it, who was it who had to stop in. %$* 333
it wasn’t france, france provided us with a phalanx of lawyers, and a leak. %$* 333
america provided us with 98% of the world—the air power, and they stopped a genocide, that’s no small achievement, ladies and gentlemen, i will—could go through all of the things which ellen laipson said, of the problems that you have enforcing, as nobody says that it’s good being the world’s policeman, nobody says it’s enjoyable, nobody would want the job. %$* 333
other than people who you wouldn’t want to have the job. %$* 333
and, if matthew parris— it’s always wary when somebody opens with compliments. %$* 333
mr. %$* 333
parris describes my cause, our side’s cause, “i think your cause is a doomed cause.” if it were a doomed cause, ladies and gentlemen, if my cause were a rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- doomed cause, it would mean that our cause as a civilization is a doomed cause. %$* 333
it is i think too early to try to give up like that. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 333
one minute. %$* 494
it wasn’t france, france provided us with a phalanx of lawyers, and a leak. %$* 333
america provided us with 98% of the world—the air power, and they stopped a genocide, that’s no small achievement, ladies and gentlemen, i will—could go through all of the things which ellen laipson said, of the problems that you have enforcing, as nobody says that it’s good being the world’s policeman, nobody says it’s enjoyable, nobody would want the job. %$* 333
other than people who you wouldn’t want to have the job. %$* 333
and, if matthew parris— it’s always wary when somebody opens with compliments. %$* 333
mr. %$* 333
parris describes my cause, our side’s cause, “i think your cause is a doomed cause.” if it were a doomed cause, ladies and gentlemen, if my cause were a rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- doomed cause, it would mean that our cause as a civilization is a doomed cause. %$* 333
it is i think too early to try to give up like that. %$* 333
thank you. %$* 333
now, against the resolution, ian bremmer. %$* 494
good evening. %$* 105
delighted to be here. %$* 105
let me first say i fully expected in a couple of minutes when we see the numbers for and against the motion that i’m against the motion, i expect most of you are against the motion. %$* 105
when we vote at the end, i know a lot of you, if it’s really skewed on the side of being against the motion are gonna want to give these guys a couple of votes. %$* 105
it’s kinda like wanting to vote for huckabee right now. %$* 105
he’s still in the game. %$* 105
and there’s stylishness and you kinda want to give him a little something for being in the game and taking the side. %$* 105
but we all know we can’t get there. %$* 105
and that’s where i am, look, michael mandelbaum made very clear that there are only two ways you can agree with me. %$* 105
number one, you have to believe that the world doesn’t need a global policeman, or number two, that there is a better system out there than having a global policeman. %$* 105
that’s spoken like a true academic. %$* 105
i agree with both of those things. %$* 105
i think the world does need a rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- global policeman, i think it would be the best system if the us was %$* 105
the global policeman. %$* 105
but i also think we are incapable, and unprepared to do it. %$* 105
so, i’m trying to be a realist. %$* 105
i’m trying to look at what we can actually do, the limitations of our power, look, i need a loving family, but my mom and dad died of cancer, i’m sorry, i’m not gonna get there. %$* 105
that’s kind of—it’s true, but it’s—i’m not looking for sympathy. %$* 105
my point is, we’re just—or laughter. %$* 105
but we’re, we’re not going to get there. %$* 105
and that’s really the crux of my argument, now, let me make a couple of points here. %$* 105
the first is i fully agree with the notion that the world desperately needs leadership. %$* 105
we are in a situation where global architecture is not catching up to the radical change in geopolitical shift. %$* 105
the united states doesn’t have the lifting power it used to, china’s growing like crazy. %$* 105
energy’s increasingly coming from unstable parts of the world. %$* 105
nato’s ineffectual. %$* 105
security council’s ineffectual, the proliferation regime is broken. %$* 105
don’t even get me started on climate change. %$* 105
lord knows, you need a leader, to take advantage of this, and to move the system in the direction that we will all be able to live more secure, more prosperous lives. %$* 105
i do believe the united states needs to fill as much of that void as possible, the united states needs to be a global leader. %$* 105
condi rice said as much at davos a couple weeks rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- ago. %$* 105
the russians strongly disagreed, they said the world does not need a conductor for the orchestra. %$* 105
and then shimon peres, the closest to henry kissinger on the panel, said, what we really need is a composer. %$* 105
not a leader. %$* 105
and i think the world does need a leader. %$* 105
i think a policeman is a very different fact on the ground, look. %$* 105
when we talk about a policeman i think about enforcement, and i think about max boots on the ground. %$* 105
i don’t think we have the political will in this country, i don’t think we have the political capital in this country, and i think trying to argue that we do, risks a growth of anti-americanism abroad. %$* 105
but more importantly and more dangerously, it risks a rise of protectionism in the united states, it risks a rise of neo-isolationism in the united states. %$* 105
look at the pew polls, look at how americans increasingly feel about support for free trade. %$* 105
look at how they increasingly feel about whether or not they believe america has benefited from the way the world system is evolving, they don’t. %$* 105
part of the reason they don’t, i suspect, is because folks in the ninth ward in new orleans don’t feel like they’re doing as well as they should. %$* 105
and they don’t necessary like the idea of giving billions of dollars of aid after a tsunami in indonesia when we can’t build our own homes in new orleans. %$* 105
i am not suggesting we shouldn’t be giving the billions of dollars in aid, i firmly believe we should. %$* 105
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- but i think that taking on the role of global policeman creates far more sentiment in the united states in opposing the world of good the united states does and should continue to do. %$* 105
let me be specific on a couple of issues. %$* 105
iran. %$* 105
the united states desperately needs to help reduce the threat of iran. %$* 105
how might we do that? %$* 105
effective sanctions? %$* 105
look at who provides refined product to iran, from around the world, it’s not the united states. %$* 105
it’s the europeans, it’s the indians. %$* 105
you want to be a global policeman on iran, you better get their support. %$* 105
how about shutting down their accounts, the accounts of the quds force, um, or of the revolutionary guard. %$* 105
better get support from dubai. %$* 105
it’s not the united states. %$* 105
the us in a globalized world can’t act as a global policeman, with one of the most important conflicts facing us today. %$* 105
lord knows they’d like to try, but unless you’re arguing that this is gonna be the next american military intervention— and there doesn’t seem to be much direct support for that even among the most ardent neoconservatives in the united states—you’ve got a serious problem. %$* 105
how about a place where we can’t even argue about military support, how about north korea. %$* 105
the united states said, if the north koreans develop a nuclear weapon, we are gonna be very, very angry. %$* 105
and the north rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- koreans tested a nuclear weapon, and you know what, the anger in washington was palpable. %$* 105
but we didn’t do anything, and we went back to the chinese, and the chinese said, we told you you don’t have a military options, sanctions aren’t gonna work, now let’s sit down at the table and work with them. %$* 105
the united states said yeah, you’re right, okay, we’ll sit down and we’ll talk to you. %$* 105
at the end of the day, i’d love to be in a position where the americans could be the global policemen on iran and north korea, it would be a better system, it’d be a safer system. %$* 105
but we can’t do it, and the more we try to do it, by ourselves in that role— %$* 105
—the less—the, the more incapable we’re going to be, okay, two final points since i only have a minute. %$* 105
first point is, what i like in terms of leadership is what bob zoellick did, vis-à-vis the chinese, is talk about stakeholdership, and the chinese originally didn’t know how to translate that word but once they did they kinda figured it out. %$* 105
we need more responsibility from the actors that are becoming vastly more powerful every day, every year vis-à-vis the united states. %$* 105
we’re increasingly going to be unable to be in favor of this motion, in four years, in eight years, in 12 years, we’d better prepare for it, by getting more rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- stakeholdership, leadership, and dare i say global policemanship, from the folks around the world that can increasingly take some of that lifting regionally. %$* 105
final point. %$* 105
indispensable nation. %$* 105
madeline albright came up with that term, actually originally from james chase, one of my mentors, i fully admit the united states is an indispensable nation. %$* 105
but you know what? %$* 105
if you’re the indispensable part of a family, if you’re the husband, if you’re the father, you do not go out, and buy a house you can’t afford, with a mortgage you can’t service. %$* 105
what you do, is you actually get your apartment, you bring home the bacon, you keep your nose down, and you ensure that you are there in a sustainable way. %$* 105
we need to recognize, that we have to eat within our means. %$* 105
we’ve got a serious problem with that in the american economy, i fear we have a serious problem with that in terms of global security, and i truly hope as a consequence you’ll vote with us against the motion, thank you very much. %$* 105
one minute— %$* 494
—the less—the, the more incapable we’re going to be, okay, two final points since i only have a minute. %$* 105
first point is, what i like in terms of leadership is what bob zoellick did, vis-à-vis the chinese, is talk about stakeholdership, and the chinese originally didn’t know how to translate that word but once they did they kinda figured it out. %$* 105

we’re increasingly going to be unable to be in favor of this motion, in four years, in eight years, in 12 years, we’d better prepare for it, by getting more rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- stakeholdership, leadership, and dare i say global policemanship, from the folks around the world that can increasingly take some of that lifting regionally. %$* 105
final point. %$* 105
indispensable nation. %$* 105
madeline albright came up with that term, actually originally from james chase, one of my mentors, i fully admit the united states is an indispensable nation. %$* 105
but you know what? %$* 105
if you’re the indispensable part of a family, if you’re the husband, if you’re the father, you do not go out, and buy a house you can’t afford, with a mortgage you can’t service. %$* 105
what you do, is you actually get your apartment, you bring home the bacon, you keep your nose down, and you ensure that you are there in a sustainable way. %$* 105
we need to recognize, that we have to eat within our means. %$* 105
we’ve got a serious problem with that in the american economy, i fear we have a serious problem with that in terms of global security, and i truly hope as a consequence you’ll vote with us against the motion, thank you very much. %$* 105
i have a question for each of you gentlemen. %$* 494
mr. %$* 494
murray. %$* 494
you talk about afghanistan and iraq, two places that have no interest in democracy, no record of human rights. %$* 494
these are %$* 494
there are tribal wars going on in both countries and certainly in rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- afghanistan where they managed to resist %$* 494
how many wars did the british fight in afghanistan, and ultimately lose? %$* 494
seven i think. %$* 494
or six or three or something like that. %$* 494
and the russians and everyone else who’s poked their nose in there. %$* 494
what on earth can this cop on the beat, this american cop on the beat, do in a place like, either afghanistan, or in iraq. %$* 494
well, i’ll tell you one— %$* 333
other than stay there forever? %$* 494
sure, well i can tell you one thing it can do and has done straight away which is that afghanistan is no longer a base where there are open training camps where terrorists can train and come and attack cities like this one we’re sitting in. %$* 333
and their heroin— %$* 494
and that’s—i don’t think, i don’t think that’s a small achievement. %$* 333
and the heroin business is booming. %$* 494
i think that’s a different question— %$* 333
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- so which—what does—well, the cop’s out there, what’s he doing? %$* 494
well, hang on, if you let me finish. %$* 333
or—i thought it was one question. %$* 333
look, as i said it’s no small thing to get the first thing done, the thing that was originally why america and her allies went into afghanistan which was to take out flagrant training camps of terrorists, and that job has been done. %$* 333
now it seems to me that the job of sorting out the afghan economy is a separate one, one which the world community generally is involved in, but i think that’s a different point. %$* 333
i don’t know if you wanted to try to make me an apologist for the american administration or a spokesperson for them but i’m not. %$* 333
well, you’re— %$* 494
my own, my own view for what it’s worth on it is that the job of creating a viable, booming economy in afghanistan is a quite different one, now this particular policeman went in and sorted out the problem. %$* 333
it doesn’t also have to be the social services department. %$* 333
ian bremmer— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- %$* 494
thank you— %$* 333
—you talk about a leader %$* 494
a fuehrer, out there, someone who’s going to, you know, some big pie in the sky who is going to suddenly have the world bowing down and saying, we want to follow you, leader, whoever that may be. %$* 494
i mean, this is wonderfully kind of anti-orwellian %$* 494
stuff you’re saying, but, what leader? %$* 494
what single leader is the world gonna follow? %$* 494
america can’t follow a single leader. %$* 494
well, historically that’s certainly true, america can’t follow a single leader but in terms of values and regimes, when we talk about for example free trade, the fact is we have an international system that the united states has been at the forefront of and has been pushing until some trends very recently, has been pushing a very strong agenda in free trade where it’s been seen as the global leader as a consequence and, whether we’re talking about, you know, sort of international norms and regimes or whether we’re talking about regional bilateral ones that’s been an extremely important process. %$* 105
the wto, the world trade organization, the united states has played a leadership role, the us as the world’s largest economy, has helped to smooth and create many, many efficiencies. %$* 105
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- if you want to talk about, um, what happened after the soviet union, uh, collapsed, if you want to talk about the efforts to denuclearize places like belarus and kazakhstan and ukraine, the us took a leadership role, that clearly made the world a more safe place. %$* 105
that’s very different from talking about being the world’s policeman, i think that there are a lot of countries that do criticize when the us doesn’t take a leadership role. %$* 105
look at the tsunami in indonesia. %$* 105
the chinese put $4 million on the ground, about a week afterwards. %$* 105
the united states got the japanese, the indians, and the australians together, billions of dollars, in this case, boots on the ground from adding— for providing humanitarian assistance, and actually made a serious difference. %$* 105
the united states is clearly indispensable in these roles as a leader, but i would not say that the us has the capacity to be the global policeman. %$* 105
okay. %$* 494
i am now ready to announce the results of the pre— %$* 494
do matthew parris and i not get the questions, have we so intimidated you that you’re not gonna ask us questions? %$* 496
well, they’ve given me four questions to ask and we’ve, they’ve— rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- i’m sorry. %$* 494
well, congratulations— %$* 496
you’ll get your chance, you will get your chance, i promise you. %$* 494
more or less. %$* 494
anyway %$* 494
i’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote. %$* 494
before the debate you voted %$* 494
24% for the resolution, 44% against, and a huge 32% undecided. %$* 494
you’ll get a chance to vote again. %$* 494
now to begin the discussion portion of the evening, i’d like to ask each of our panelists to pose a question to the opposing side. %$* 494
max boot— %$* 494
well, i’d like to ask a question of matthew parris and i am tempted to ask if you know what the words “ad hominem” mean but i will refrain from asking that— %$* 89
yeah. %$* 497
instead i would like to ask about your fascinating claim that you have great knowledge and power to intuit the feelings of the american people which is denied to those of us who actually live here. %$* 89
and i would like to ask you, therefore, why you claim that the american people will not support this role of rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- global policeman if in fact they have supported american troops being stationed in east asia and europe for over 60 years and why you think that republican and conservative voters in particular, do not support an interventionist role for the united states when they consistently back presidents and presidential candidates such as ronald reagan, george h.w. bush, george w. bush— %$* 89
—and john mccain who are in fact leading advocates of intervention— %$* 89
i must remind the panelists that these are questions, not speeches. %$* 494
so— %$* 494
well— %$* 89
—please keep the question brief, and then matthew parris— %$* 494
there was a question mark at the end— %$* 89
—please keep your answer brief. %$* 494
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- well of course i know a great deal less of the american people than almost everybody else on the panel, i only have the hunches that i get from those whom i know and the time that i spent there. %$* 497
and also a little bit that i know about the history of the british empire and british colonialism and much of which i’ve lived in my own childhood, and, my impression, and i may be wrong, is that the—there’s a good patriotic spirit in america for invasions of foreign countries where those invasions can be seen as palpably in the national interest in order to defend america from people abroad. %$* 497
but that there isn’t the same interest in administering other countries, there isn’t the same interest in prolonged occupations of other countries, there isn’t the same interest in doing what policemen do abroad, and that it’s only as long as america is winning in those circumstances that public opinion remains positive, it quite quickly turns against, when conditions seem to be coming adverse. %$* 497
ellen laipson, who do you have a question for. %$* 494
i’d like to ask michael mandelbaum to tell us how he would get to the end state that he desires, of the us as the world’s policeman, what would you do, you spoke very disparagingly of the un.what would you do with the 17 current peace missions that the rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- united states has supported, by its vote authorizing them in the security council, the 100,000 soldiers and policemen that are deployed worldwide in these trouble spots. %$* 495
is your view that those operations should simply shut down and go away? %$* 495
not at all, i’m delighted with them, i think we should have more of them, i think the united states should support them, but they add up to only a small fraction of the policing that’s necessary in the world. %$* 496
in fact, i claim that the united states does police the world and does do so effectively and let me give you three examples. %$* 496
in east asia, contrary to what mr. %$* 496
bremmer said, the united states does a very effective job of containing although not preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by north korea, with the seventh fleet, with its security treaties with japan and south korea, without them, east asia would be a much more dangerous place. %$* 496
similarly, in the persian gulf, although the united states has not dealt with complete success with iran, our military presence over the horizon and our naval presence assures the free flow of petroleum which is a global necessity. %$* 496
a policeman walks the beat. %$* 496
the united states does that in the persian gulf and in east asia, it’s extremely important that it do so. %$* 496
to the extent that other countries can chip in, all the better. %$* 496
but they just don’t do enough, and i don’t have any expectation that they will. %$* 496
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- michael mandelbaum, who do you have a question for. %$* 494
well, i’d like to make a comment— %$* 496
no, no, it’s question time, not opinion. %$* 494
well then i’ll—i’ll turn it into a question. %$* 496
and who— %$* 494
mr. %$* 496
parris gave, i would say a rather broad view of american anti- imperialism but not altogether inaccurate so let me give a reply in a similar spirit and it follows onto what ellen laipson said and my response. %$* 496
i would say in response to you comment about american opposition to the british empire— %$* 496
question, in question, sir. %$* 494
it’s a question. %$* 496
we thought— we thought we could do it better than you did. %$* 496
but we were wrong. %$* 496
come back. %$* 496
we would be delighted for the british to do more by way of global policing, so will you, as an influential member of the political class in britain, commit to agitating in favor of the royal navy rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- growing larger rather than smaller so that it can resume the policing of the atlantic and the mediterranean that it did so well and so necessarily and with such great benefit to everyone, including that large free-rider across the atlantic, the united states, in the 19th century. %$* 496
well, i’ll i’ll reciprocate your humility. %$* 497
you suggest that you or the americans have learnt that imperialism, indeed british imperialism was a better thing than you thought it was at the time. %$* 497
i would say that we british have learnt that imperialism was not as good a thing as we thought that it was, at the time, but there is a limit to the extent that a country that has no economic global predominance can continue to police large sections of the globe. %$* 497
we learnt that, to our very great cost, it’s a lesson that we’ve learnt and i think we’re not going to un-learn it and if we have any advice for you it is not to repeat the mistake. %$* 497
matthew parris, do you have a question for someone here. %$* 494
yes. %$* 497
i’d—again, it’s to mr. %$* 497
mandelbaum. %$* 497
it’s a serious question, i— rather than a—an ad hominem one, i’d like you to %$* 497
i’d like you to deal with the question of legitimacy with policemen, a policeman in new york works for an authority that is elected, enforces laws which have been enacted by people who have been rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- elected and is in many ways of the community that he polices. %$* 497
america as world policemen would be a very different kind of animal. %$* 497
there would be no such presumed consent, there’s a real problem— %$* 497
question— %$* 494
—about legitimacy— %$* 497
—question, please, sir— %$* 494
—about authority, and i wonder how you answer that problem. %$* 497
i answer it as follows. %$* 496
the united states as the global policeman is not as legitimate as the new york city police force is. %$* 496
and it cannot be because there is no global government, no global state to give it legitimacy. %$* 496
but it has enough legitimacy, because nobody opposes it, as they would if they didn’t like it and felt threatened by it. %$* 496
indeed, as i say in my, my book the case for goliath, i think there is a threat, there is a threat to the american role as the world’s governments, but it doesn’t come from other countries. %$* 496
it comes from the mounting costs of social welfare, of our entitlement programs, the great threat to the american role as the world’s policeman and to global order rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- comes not from china—pace mr. %$* 496
bremmer—it comes from medicare. %$* 496
mr. %$* 494
murray %$* 494
gosh, i don’t have any lack of questions for the other side, but the one i’d most like to ask is ian bremmer, who mentioned, i just pricked up about the pew polls, about what people across the globe think of america. %$* 333
and aside from the vaguely unpleasant sight of anyone caring that much about how much they’re liked i wonder if you’ve seen the pew polls about suicide bombing—people who are in favor of suicide bombing as a tactic, across the arab and muslim world, particularly, legitimizing vast percentages the murder of israelis. %$* 333
and whether you’ve seen the pew polls that show the number of people across the middle east and elsewhere, the huge numbers of people who think that for instance 9-11 was a conspiracy, forced on the american people by their own government, by mossad and all this sort of thing. %$* 333
based on all this, do you think that this is all america’s fault, or do you think other people have agency and the ability to cock up. %$* 333
no, i certainly don’t think this is all america’s fault. %$* 105
i think i’ve rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- pretty much said i’d like the idea of the united states being the world’s policeman, we just can’t get there, it’s generally a kinda country i’d probably enjoy, again i’d like the idea of having a private plane but it’s not happening tomorrow. %$* 105
you know, i would say that you’re referring to the wrong pew polls. %$* 105
in terms of my comment, it wasn’t on how much countries like america. %$* 105
it was about how much americans actually support globalization, how much they support free trade. %$* 105
and also how much they believe that the united states benefits from growing foreign companies, companies in emerging markets and the rest. %$* 105
and they compared those views on free trade, with the views of other foreign nationals in countries like russia, china and india. %$* 105
and, for—in a dramatic shift of fortunes, americans have proven to be less pro-globalization, less pro-free trade than the russians, the chinese, and the indians, and that shows something very disturbing, in my view, which is that increasingly the average american does not believe that they benefit from the trajectory that the world is moving towards. %$* 105
and that not only speaks against growing opposition to the united states serving as the world’s policeman, but it also speaks against the united states serving the role as, as a leader on key issues where international leadership is lacking, and i really fear that we will throw the baby out with the bathwater on this one. %$* 105
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- ian bremmer, do you have a question. %$* 494
yes i do, and i would ask it to michael but he’s already gotten two so i’m gonna ask either max or douglas if they—if they want to take it. %$* 105
it is, that—it follows on this issue of legitimacy and the notion that all countries around the world kind of like the idea of the us as a policeman. %$* 105
and i’m wondering, what do we do in those big issues where it’s clear that they don’t. %$* 105
you know, what do we do about russia, where clearly, whether we’re talking about chechnya, or georgia, or ukraine, the orange revolution and the rest, the russians really assertively don’t want the united states to be a policeman. %$* 105
what do we do in a place like taiwan, where the chinese really assertively—and increasingly have the power to stop the us—don’t want the us to act as global policeman, how do we— and i’m asking, actually out of legitimate curiosity, how do we deal with those sorts of challenges. %$* 105
i guess i would reply that’s a little bit like asking well what do we do about the fact that john gotti doesn’t like the nypd in his neighborhood. %$* 89
well, you have to deal with those issues, and sometimes you have to deal with them diplomatically and obviously nobody’s suggesting that we start a war with russia or rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- china because we dislike some of their behavior. %$* 89
but, you—the problem with the position that your side takes which is multilateralism is that basically, you hold us hostage to the views of a russia or china, you basically say, we cannot act by leading a coalition of the willing, we cannot act with our posse, we have to wait for some multilateral institution before we can do something and of course, russia and china have vetoes in the most powerful multilateral institution that exists and they use their vetoes to shield wrongdoers such as iran developing nuclear weapons, or to try to prevent us from intervening for example in kosovo to stop the genocide. %$* 89
so if you pay too much heed to the opinions of countries like russia or china or other dictatorships which don’t have the best interests, our best interests at heart or the world’s best interests at heart, basically you allow the world’s worst criminals free rein. %$* 89
and that’s something i don’t think we can afford to, to let happen. %$* 89
i’d like to open the q-and-a up to the audience now. %$* 494
please stand when you ask your questions, and i ask that you do not start to ask the question until you have the microphone, one will get to you. %$* 494
and please, please make the question short and to the point. %$* 494
and if you’re a member of the press here, please identify yourself. %$* 494
any questions? %$* 494
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- %$* 494
i—over here. %$* 9
i have one, over here. %$* 9
i have a question for mr. %$* 9
bremmer. %$* 9
you adduce a nuclear north korea as an example of a failed %$* 9
police work, is that—is that the case? %$* 9
inability of the united states to act—not failed police work, just the us doesn’t have the capacity to act as a policeman in the case of north korea, yes. %$* 105
my understanding is that madeline albright went over, jimmy carter went over, flattered kim jong-il %$* 9
then he went nuclear. %$* 9
if you’re aware of some other %$* 9
non-diplomatic means that were employed and failed, would you please share them with us. %$* 9
look, i mean, i’m not trying to argue, i think morley raised the same point in a question to ellen which is that, oh well, engagement clearly doesn’t work with iran because the iranians don’t want to be engaged—i’m with you. %$* 105
the iranians don’t want to be engaged, they’re moving, they’re going nuclear. %$* 105
the north koreans didn’t want to be engaged, i mean criminy, they don’t want pro-globalization, you throw cnn in north korea, you know, probably kim jong-il falls relatively quickly, they want to keep the place isolated, they want to build their nukes, they want to buy people off, they want to blackmail, they want to sell drugs, rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- they want to sell ballistic missiles, they want to engage in human trade. %$* 105
this is a nasty, brutish and quite short regime. %$* 105
i don’t expect that any of the united states’ policies were likely to work, my point was, the chinese have more leverage over north korea than the united states does, there was no military option, you attack north korea to try to stop them, south korea’s devastated within 36 hours because of artillery if you look at geography. %$* 105
so that wasn’t an option. %$* 105
even the most ardent opponents in the defense department weren’t trying to go there. %$* 105
so given the fact that you don’t like the regime, given you don’t want them to develop the nukes, you want to stop them, the united states has to think about who has the power, and it’s not just the us, you gotta go to the chinese, who actually are providing these guys with the lifeline economically, and say we need to work with you. %$* 105
that’s not the us acting as a global policeman, that’s america in a more multilateral role trying to cajole relatively incalcitrant countries, recalcitrant countries to do their best. %$* 105
other questions? %$* 494
i think one of the key questions has been avoided. %$* 9
and this only was personally alluded by mr. %$* 9
parris. %$* 9
and the, the question is, how do you be the policeman if you don’t longer have predominance. %$* 9
the key and imperative word is “predominance.” rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- like the english empire, lo— lost its role as master of the world when it lost economic predominance after the first world war, the united states no longer has the predominance it ought to have to be the policeman. %$* 9
so the question is what can we—be done, without the predominance. %$* 9
you want to take that %$* 494
ah. %$* 496
—michael mandelbaum? %$* 494
the united states can continue to act as the world’s policeman as long as serious countries do not actively oppose it. %$* 496
and that means that since there is no longer a cold war, it is in many ways cheaper for the united states to carry out the legitimate police functions in the world that it does carry out. %$* 496
and it carries them out, with the sufferance, with the tacit agreement of major countries, including russia and china, that disagree with the united states on some important issues, but still value the american role at least to the extent that they do not oppose it. %$* 496
can i also add to that? %$* 333
there’s a confusion going on at the moment here, between policing and being an imperial power. %$* 333
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- which is going to i think, cause a problem on the voting at least for this side. %$* 333
which is why i mention it, being a world policeman in the definition that we’re going on at the moment is quite different from being a world authoritarian. %$* 333
and to go back to ellen laipson’s definitions when she said that, the definition of policing would be enforcing the rules, setting the rules and having a monopoly on the use of force— america does enforce the rules, they tend not to be ones set by themselves, they tend to be set by all sorts of other organizations and nations in history. %$* 333
and america certainly doesn’t have monopoly on the use of force as for instance the intervention in sierra leone by my own country would demonstrate. %$* 333
but i would just tidy that up, just because you—we’re saying on this side that, that we would like america to be the world’s policeman does not mean we’re suggesting that it is like the british empire was, or that it’s like any other empire, i don’t think it is an empire, being a policeman’s quite different. %$* 333
there are a lot of nasty conflicts in the world at any given time, so this is a question for those who support the motion. %$* 9
what’s the criteria %$* 9
for the, the united states to intervene as policemen, would that include kenya today, would that include, mozambique, would that include darfur, would that include rwanda in the early ‘90s %$* 9
rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- excellent question, who wants to field it. %$* 494
well, i don’t think that you can come up with any hard and fast criteria, i think a lot of what you do has to be really based on a realistic assessment of your capabilities at the moment, and nobody suggests that for example, that, if you have %$* 89
if you saw murders occurring in new york city that therefore, the new york police department is a complete failure. %$* 89
obviously there are going to be crimes occurring in the world. %$* 89
we cannot stop all of them, it’s beyond our means, everybody will admit that. %$* 89
but i think we have to do what we can. %$* 89
and i think—i’m with bill clinton when he said that it was a mistake not to have intervened in rwanda, not to have stopped a genocide that it was in our power to stop, i think, it was correct that we did intervene in bosnia and kosovo and we stopped terrible bloodletting in the balkans. %$* 89
today obviously our forces are engaged in afghanistan and iraq and we don’t have the capability to intervene as many including me would like in places like darfur. %$* 89
and that’s a sad, tragic reality, which means that hundreds of thousands of people are dying. %$* 89
but of course, even if we don’t have the capability to lead an intervention with massive use of force we can do other things such as using our global leadership role to push economic sanctions, or to provide enablers that might allow others to rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- intervene, but unfortunately for all the talk from the other side, about how there are so many others out there willing to play this global policing role, we find time and time again, there’s been very few cases of anybody willing to step forward where the united states does not lead and, i’m in favor of american leadership while recognizing the limits of our power and the fact that we cannot possibly intervene in every case, i think we should try to do as much good as possible within the bounds of our power. %$* 89
there was—if i can just put in quickly, there’s a good quote here from mr. %$* 497
blair, our former premier in britain. %$* 497
when-- %$* 497
i mean i think on the important point to make which is that just because you can’t intervene everywhere doesn’t mean you don’t intervene anywhere. %$* 497
and before the iraq war mr. %$* 497
blair was asked by a journalistnwhy he was going for this particular conflict and he said, it’s a very important phrase and i absolutely agree with it, he said people—i get fed up when people say to me why not the burmese lot, why not mugabe. %$* 497
he said, i don’t, because i can’t. %$* 497
but when you can, you should. %$* 497
we have time for two more questions, brief ones, please. %$* 494
question is for the proponents of the motion. %$* 9
given the fact that rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- medicare and social security, and other elements in our safety net are gonna be with us for a while would any of you advocate the institution of a military draft, to provide the power that would be necessary to be the world policeman on a scale that would fit the needs of the problems that are going to arise in the foreseeable future. %$* 9
i don’t think a draft would solve the problem. %$* 496
and of course the military doesn’t want a draft, and the united states carries out its policing role without a huge mass army of the kind that great powers fielded until the last third of the 20th century. %$* 496
but i do agree, and i did say, that this is a substantial problem and does present a threat to american foreign policy. %$* 496
and if it results in the curtailing of the global services that include providing a global police force, the whole world, including those who most harshly criticize american foreign policy, will be sorry. %$* 496
can i just jump in and just make one point? %$* 89
because i think in your question and some of the others i kind of scent this notion of american declinism in the air. %$* 89
and the fact that we’re %$* 89
woe is us. %$* 89
we’re over-stretched. %$* 89
we can’t do everything that we want to do. %$* 89
and i think you should be aware of just how vast our power is. %$* 89
the fact is that we spend more than the rest of the world, or as much as the rest of the world combined, on defense. %$* 89
and rosenkranz foundation-intelligence square u.s.- we’re still spending only four per cent of our gdp, which is several percentage points less than we were spending during the cold war. %$* 89
we still have the world’s largest and richest economy. %$* 89
we’ve been creating jobs at a pace that out-clips any other industrialized economy over the last twenty or thirty years. %$* 89
our population size is growing. %$* 89
we’re already the third largest country by population in the world. %$* 89
and we’re projected to increase by another hundred and fifty million over the course of the next fifty years. %$* 89
there are vast pools of power and resources in the united states that can be mobilized for the task that we have to undertake. %$* 89
and in fact, we have mobilized them in essentially policing the world over the last sixty years. %$* 89

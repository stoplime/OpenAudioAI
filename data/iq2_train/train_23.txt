after the debate: for the motion: 27% against the motion: 66% undecided: 7% my name is john donvan, and we will formally begin the debate in a couple of minutes but first i wanted to explain a couple of things, most particularly about your role as the audience, if you have been here before you know this but if this is the first time, i wanna point out that as audience members you are actually part of the debate in a few different ways. %$* 13
most importantly you are the judges of the winners of the debate, we ask you to vote twice, both before the debate and again at the end, to share your— whether or not you agree with the motion, whether you’re against the motion or whether you are undecided. %$* 13
and tonight we’re doing something a little bit more nuanced, we are going to ask you to vote in such a way that we can tell—we can tally votes from men, and votes from women, at every step of the way. %$* 13
ah! %$* 13
the way that we’ll vote, there’s a keypad next to your seat, attached to your seat %$* 13
and if you are female, the numbers that concern you are 1, 2, and 3 %$* 13
1 means that you are for, 1 means that you are female and you are for the resolution, 2 means that you are against the resolution, and 3 means that you’re undecided. %$* 13
if you are male, you are concerned with the numbers 4, 5, 6. 4 means that you’re for the resolution, 5 means that you’re against and 6 means that you’re undecided, and we’ll vote %$* 13
shortly after the debate officially begins. %$* 13
takes about 30 seconds to vote and i’ll give everybody a chance. %$* 13
a couple more things very briefly, we are being broadcast on national public radio as all of these debates are, now on more than 185 stations across the nation. %$* 13
we are going to have two endings tonight, one of them will be, the ending that will be broadcast on radio in which we will simply, report at the end of the debate %$* 13
the accumulated results without breaking them down by sex. %$* 13
after that we’ll have our second ending which is just for you, in which we’ll share what the results were by sex, how men voted, and by how women voted. %$* 13
i’d like to begin by introducing the chairman of intelligence squared us, mr. %$* 13
robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
well thank you all very much for joining us this evening. %$* 1
tonight’s resolution is the same language that was used in an iq squared debate in london. %$* 1
and that was a very, very lively debate and we thought it’d be fun to, or interesting to repeat it here. %$* 1
my role typically in these evenings is to sort of frame the debate, to summarize the arguments that we might expect to hear on both sides. %$* 1
but as i thought about the language of today’s resolution, it seemed to me that it was not quite the crisp, clear proposition that we usually try to put forth. %$* 1
and it might be more useful for me to reflect a little bit on the actual words of the, of the resolution. %$* 1
the first the word “wrong.” well, it’s certainly wrong to pay for sex if you wanna keep your job as the governor of new york. %$* 1
and %$* 1
you know—i predict a laugh. %$* 1
but wrong in that sense is wrong as a matter of public morality. %$* 1
and that’s one way of discussing right and wrong. %$* 1
another way of discussing it is in terms of, just private individual conduct, is this gonna make you feel like you’ve lived a well-lived life if you abide by these principles or don’t abide by these principles. %$* 1
and the third kind of possible definition of wrong, is it should be illegal, or it should be legal. %$* 1
so those are three different meanings of “wrong,” and might lead to three very different takes on tonight’s, resolution. %$* 1
the language “to pay” is quite deliberate, because it’s focusing on the economically advantaged party, and that was a very conscious choice, both in london and by ourselves. %$* 1
and finally the notion of paying for sex, can encompass such an incredibly broad range of ideas,— from patrons of child prostitutes in thai brothels, to rich wall streeters who support their girlfriends in graduate school. %$* 1
so there’s such a huge range of meanings here, in the language of, of the resolution, and we have such an able group of panelists. %$* 1
but i think sorting this out and keeping these proceedings orderly, is a difficult task tonight and it falls to the very able john donvan who’ll take the evening from here. %$* 1
thank you, and may i invite one more round of applause for robert rosenkranz. %$* 13
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another intelligence squared us debate, i’m john donvan of abc news “nightline,” and i will be moderating the debaters that you see sharing the stage here with me at the caspary auditorium at the rockefeller university in new york city. %$* 13
six debaters, two tables, three against three, will be debating this motion, “it is wrong to pay for sex.” now this is not a seminar or a penal discussion, this is a competition, winners and loser, it is a contest of ideas and logic and quick-wittedness and perhaps charm, but most of all, persuasion, because by the time this debate concludes, you the audience will have voted twice, both before the debate and once again at the end, your vote is to tell us whether you side with or against the teams on this stage and their arguments, and the team which has changed the most minds over the course of the debate, will be declared the winner. %$* 13
so now we’re gonna bring up the house lights, and we are going to hold our first vote and i will reemphasize for those who might have arrived late, tonight, we are asking men and women to vote using separate keys. %$* 13
keys 1, 2, and 3 are for women, 4, 5, and 6 are for men. %$* 13
if you are female vote 1 if you are with the proposition, 2 if you vote against, and 3 if you are undecided, if you are male, vote 4 if you are for the proposition, 5 if you are against, and 6 if you are undecided. %$* 13
if you have made a mistake, and you regret %$* 13
your key punch %$* 13
just correct it, and we will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
and i’m seeing the faces that everybody gets this and we’re good, does anybody need more time? %$* 13
okay, so we’re gonna lock in the vote. %$* 13
and proceed with the debate. %$* 13
and now round 1, arguing for the motion, wendy shalit, a writer, who has %$* 13
made something of a career of writing about the topic of modesty, and seems to come up with an excellent gift for titles. %$* 13
her first piece for commentary when she was a college student at williams college criticizing the co-ed bathroom policy was, “a ladies’ room of one’s own.” and your all but last book is titled, girl— girls— %$* 13
the good girl revolution. %$* 193
oh, i was thinking of girls gone mild. %$* 13
yes, that, that’s the hardcover— %$* 193
which—which was its previous title and it’s also brilliant. %$* 13
yes. %$* 193
wendy shalit, ladies and gentlemen— %$* 13
we changed it ‘cause there was some confusion. %$* 193
thank you. %$* 193
ladies and gentleman, thank you so much for joining us tonight to consider this most important topic. %$* 193
before delving in i still have in my mind a song i heard on the way to the airport on the radio, which went like this. %$* 193
“i’m not a saint but i’m not a sinner, everything’s cool as long as i’m getting thinner.” which, i think, expresses a profound truth, actually. %$* 193
it’s a serious question. %$* 193
in a society in which the self is the body, to some degree, as long as we’re getting thinner, do we even believe that there is such a thing as a sexual right, and a sexual wrong. %$* 193
nobody wants to judge. %$* 193
adultery is now a lifestyle choice. %$* 193
a 22-year-old woman from san diego, is now auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder. %$* 193
right? %$* 193
and we’re not supposed to judge. %$* 193
and yet i would submit that we do judge, all the time. %$* 193
when i was living here in manhattan some 10 years ago, i’ll never forget the time when i was innocently buying my metro pass, and sipping my coffee, and a man came up from behind me and barked at me and he said, you know, you shouldn’t drink those frappaccinos, they’re very fattening. %$* 193
and i was shocked that a perfect stranger would presume to judge my beverage choices that way. %$* 193
but then i realized that everybody has a notion of right and wrong and to this man frappaccinos were just wrong. %$* 193
my worthy opponent, sydney barrows, writes in her memoir, mayflower madame, that a dns in the call girl business stood for “do not send.” men who were obnoxious or who had really gross apartments, she wouldn’t send her girls to such men. %$* 193
and she also writes, “whenever i read about a business who had done something i didn’t approve of, such as a building an ugly high- rise in a residential neighborhood, i added his name to the list, just in case he ever called us.” which i thought was really funny, also. %$* 193
to some people, building an ugly high-rise is morally wrong. %$* 193
it’s an offense against the aesthetic order. %$* 193
ladies and gentlemen, i would submit to you that paying for sex is at least as wrong as building an ugly high- rise. %$* 193
perhaps more so. %$* 193
why, because we’re using— we’re talking about using a human being as a means to your ends. %$* 193
today people want to believe that paying for sex is just like paying for a hamburger. %$* 193
but a sexual transaction is different, because it teaches on the deepest, most personal aspects of ourselves. %$* 193
the proof that sex is different, in my opinion, is our response to the terrible crime of rape. %$* 193
if paying for sex were as morally neutral as paying for a hamburger, well then, rape is akin to just forcing someone to eat a hamburger. %$* 193
right? %$* 193
but of course it is not. %$* 193
it is a horrible crime, that is serious, precisely because sexuality touches on the deepest, most personal aspect of our humanity. %$* 193
and to take something so intimate, and to turn it into a commodity, has far- reaching, devastating effects, for men, women and children. %$* 193
everyone agrees that after the netherlands adopted legalization that this has added fuel to the gangs who trafficked in underage girls, and that the abuse in child prostitution exploded rather than was reduced. %$* 193
it’s time to ask why. %$* 193
well, firstly what we value in women, eventually trickles down to girls. %$* 193
for example today we place a lot of value on hotness in women, have you noticed this? %$* 193
and so, now in, for example in the bratts babies video, which is watched by three- and four-year-old girls by the way, you can hear cartoon babies singing songs about “being hotter than hot, show what you’ve got, ready or not.” for three- year-olds. %$* 193
what we value in women inevitably trickles down to girls. %$* 193
secondly prostitution, like all industries, is demand-led. %$* 193
someone could go to great trouble manufacturing coats made from cockroaches, but since nobody wants cockroach coats, the supplier would soon find that there’s no market, no demand, and no money in it, except may ozzy osbourne would buy it. %$* 193
but because prostitution is demand-led, it’s the paying for sex that’s a problem. %$* 193
that’s what creates the demand, and given that the average age of entry into prostitution is 13 or 14 years old, i think this presents a huge moral problem. %$* 193
i receive a ton of emails from girls who are 14, 15, leave home, because they’ve been abused, only to try to escape prostitution. %$* 193
unfortunately at the time, one writes to me, “it was all i felt i had to offer the world, my body. %$* 193
as you can no doubt guess, i was molested by my father for many years when i was a child. %$* 193
it’s why my mother let me leave. %$* 193
so in a sense i was raised to believe my body had only one use, and i was worth only this one thing.” we can talk later about why the molestation rates for prostitutes are so high, why the suicide rates are so high. %$* 193
but, right now i wanna focus on the fact that the problem is that nobody knows if these girls are 14 or 18.and, we think about the sheer number of sex slaves in captivity in the us, we’re talking about, anything from 30,000 to 50,000.it’s staggering, and it’s sickening. %$* 193
we’re talking about girls that are having sex with 20 to 30 men per day, one girl told the new york times about her cell of traffickers, her captors offered three age ranges of sex partners, toddler to age four, age five to 12, and teens as well as the damage group %$* 193
where they could do anything that they wanted. %$* 193
when one of the mexican child-trafficking rings was busted in a house in plainfield, new jersey, uh, another mexican ring was recently busted-- %$* 193
but this one was a few years ago—the neighbors, in retrospect thought about all the cars that came, and all of the girls that %$* 193
left that house to buy candy, but they always said no one knew what was going on. %$* 193
i’m always struck that the neighbors always say this, well somebody knew what was going on because someone was paying for the sex. %$* 193
to those who are against trafficking, but they insist that some women have nothing else to sell but their bodies, i say that they suffer from a real lack of imagination. %$* 193
about the power of the human spirit and about the strength of women in particular and if you keep up with the harvard business review, you may have noticed, that they’re now talking about micro-loans to poor women and only lending them, only having these loans to poor women. %$* 193
right? %$* 193
because they notice that the poorest of women reinvest in the household and the men do not. %$* 193
we have to believe in the women first, it takes a risk to give them that loan. %$* 193
if instead we demand their bodies instead of appealing to their intelligence, it’s this philosophy of this is all she can do, and the not too subtle misogyny behind it, that feeds the demand and expectations that cause the problem. %$* 193
thank you— %$* 193
thank you. %$* 193
wendy shalit, your time is up. %$* 13
thank you— %$* 193
thank you very much. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 193
and again for newcomers, in the opening round each speaker has even minutes uninterrupted to speak so wendy had just reached the seven-minute point. %$* 13
up first to speak against the motion that it’s wrong to pay to sex, lionel tiger, the charles darwin professor of anthropology at rutgers university, the anthropologist who gave us the term “male bonding.” he has been arguing more recently that it is men who get the short end in society. %$* 13
given, lionel, your writing about men’s issues i’ve always wondered %$* 13
tiger, is that something you adopted late in life or were you born a tiger. %$* 13
it’s appropriate for that branch of show business known as the academic profession. %$* 194
it works quite well. %$* 194
ladies and gentlemen, lionel tiger. %$* 13
thank you very much, thank you, wendy, for starting this off in a serious and interesting manner. %$* 194
i have to say, i’m quite confounded by this, because it’s quite clearly wrong to pay for wrong sex. %$* 194
there is no one in this room i daresay, who will shed a tear for anyone who is jailed for trafficking in toddlers. %$* 194
that i think is an absurdity, to start a discussion about the very serious, momentous issue of human sexuality. %$* 194
so, we’re all opposed to coercive, we’re all opposed unequivocally, i’m sure, to the kind of stories we hear about the russian mafia trafficking women whose passports are stolen from them and then they have to work off their fare and so on. %$* 194
these are all obvious. %$* 194
they’re not debatable. %$* 194
i won’t debate them, therefore. %$* 194
but what we have with respect to, wendy just heard is a perfect contemporary exposition of the early 20th century sociological fallacy, which is you look for a deviant phenomenon, and attribute to that the nature of the normal. %$* 194
so by talking about rape, talking about toddlers being abused sexually, this then frames the entire discussion of what you guys and gals may decide to do in your own homes with your own lust, with your own love, and that is simply methodologically wrong. %$* 194
furthermore, it begins from a premise that legal distinctions constitute the vocabulary of life’s distinctions. %$* 194
and again, this is simply methodologically improper. %$* 194
so for example in american sociology many early sociologists would look at prison behavior and say ah-ha, this is what life is really like. %$* 194
it’s not. %$* 194
it’s a prison. %$* 194
it’s what it is because of what it is. %$* 194
it’s not reflective. %$* 194
and furthermore, i get here, and forgive me for maybe being, counter-casting here, but i think this entire argument somehow is profoundly disrespectful to females. %$* 194
if you want to see people paying for sex, i suggest you go to the ground floor of bloomingdale’s. %$* 194
the place is full of women paying for garments, colors, clasps, various instruments of torture— lust, you name it, but they’re paying for their own sense of themselves as sexual creatures, and they’re not on that floor because they don’t like sex and they don’t like what it means. %$* 194
and furthermore, what it tells us about is, that there’s an inner economy to sex, that doesn’t have to do with raping toddlers, with raping girls who are abused by their fathers, please. %$* 194
if you’re raped by your father you’ve got a problem independently of the one we’re discussing. %$* 194
that’s just how it is. %$* 194
there was a remarkable story in the times, last couple of weeks ago, about a website called seekingarrangement.com. %$* 194
in this website, men and women can sign up to be-- %$* 194
essentially a rich wall street executive, thank you, mr. %$* 194
rosenkranz for the metaphor—to be set up and go through graduate school. %$* 194
now in this system, which is not explicitly about sex, it’s about a wide variety of things, the ratio of women applying to men, is 10 to one. %$* 194
free choice. %$* 194
10 to one. %$* 194
these are probably women you know, i know, who knows. %$* 194
but the fact is that—and this is just one anecdote and it’s not typical of everything, please don’t overextend it, but the fact is that women have a deal with men which requires that they have some relationship with men, especially if they’re inclined to reproduce which still 80 percent of women in north america. %$* 194
and women know that they will have five to eight years when they’re out of the labor force, and, it helps to have a guy around the place. %$* 194
and so %$* 194
the fact is that if we’re looking just now, mr. %$* 194
donvan mentioned the current male- female balance. %$* 194
in this current recession or depression or whatever it’s called, 82 percent of the jobs lost are male jobs. %$* 194
that means that, women will not have a guy—if they want one %$* 194
this is free choice, please, i’m not an obligatory heterosexual mastermind here but if women want a mate, then they’re not going to have %$* 194
one of those men that has lost a job. %$* 194
it’s a complicated argument but it’s a long story, i’m an anthropologist, we’re interested in what people around the world do, 90—over 90 percent of human marriages are arranged. %$* 194
they’re determined by families in terms of the larger interests of the two clans, they usually involve a bride price or a dowry, or something like that in which the male usually commits himself to sustaining the female, we don’t do it with cattle, we do it with some exotic unit called the diamond ring. %$* 194
an engagement ring is the world’s stupidest object, the moment you take it out of the store, it’s lost 80 percent of its value, if in fact it has any value at all, just ask debeers, there’s—they’re crying. %$* 194
but, the guy has to pay two months’ after-tax income for this diamond ring, to give to the gal to assure her that he’s going to be okay. %$* 194
now, if he’s not, she keeps the ring. %$* 194
but the point is that this is a— this is a classic anthropological phenomenon, my time is quickly run out, i had no idea that %$* 194
—it would— i— %$* 194
it’s up— %$* 13
—it would— i— %$* 194
lionel, lionel tiger, ladies and gentlemen, whose time is up. %$* 13
of all of our debaters tonight, our next speaker who will be arguing for the motion that it’s wrong to pay for sex has truly brought the arsenal of the researcher to this topic. %$* 13
melissa farley is a clinical and research psychologist with prostitution research and education which is a non-profit that she founded. %$* 13
she is an associate scholar with the center for world indigenous studies, her position on prostitution has been described as abolitionist and i’m assuming, melissa, that our familiarity with that word and the topic of slavery is no coincidence for you. %$* 13
it is not. %$* 195
ladies and gentlemen, melissa farley. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 195
thanks. %$* 195
some words hide the truth. %$* 195
just as torture is named, “enhanced interrogation,” and the logging of old-growth forests is called the healthy forest initiative, so also prostitution is named a choice, a job, work, a victimless crime, and on craigslist it’s called “a wide range of personal meeting and relationship opportunities.” these pimp-messaged slogans are good for business but there’s not much truth to them. %$* 195
what’s wrong with prostitution is the renting out of a woman’s mouth, vagina, or anus, and what it does to her, psychologically. %$* 195
what’s wrong with prostitution, and what’s wrong with buying sex, are the same things that are wrong with other forms of violence against women, incest, rape, and battery. %$* 195
i’ve been researching prostitution for 15 years, we’ve interviewed 900 women, men, and transgendered people in prostitution, in nine countries on five continents. %$* 195
and over the course of that time we’ve also interviewed 500 johns. %$* 195
prostitution is not a choice because the precise conditions that make a choice are absent. %$* 195
for example, equality with buyers, and physical safety, and real alternatives. %$* 195
if you imagine a pyramid, remember that only about the top 5 percent of all women in prostitution are at the top of that pyramid. %$* 195
these are people that are privileged by race and class. %$* 195
the other 95 percent don’t have those kinds of privilege or alternatives for escape. %$* 195
let me give you some examples of the sex inequality, the race-ethnic inequality, and the economic inequality in prostitution that are often invisible. %$* 195
a woman in lusaka, who knew that five blow jobs would get her a sack of mealy meal to feed her kids. %$* 195
that’s not a choice. %$* 195
a woman in india who worked in an office where she concluded that she might as well be paid for the sexual harassment that was expected of her anyway, in her job. %$* 195
that’s not a choice. %$* 195
the teen in california who said that in her neighborhood, boys grew up to be dealers and pimps and girls to be ‘hos. %$* 195
she was the third generation of prostituted women in her family. %$* 195
and prostitution more severely harms people who are indigenous or ethnically marginalized because of their lack of alternatives. %$* 195
that’s not a choice. %$* 195
or the young woman sold by her parents in a brothel in nevada. %$* 195
she took six different psychiatric drugs to make it through the day, selling sex, that’s not a choice, or ashley dupre, who was bought by governor spitzer. %$* 195
dupre ran away from what she called an abusive home at 17, she’d been homeless, she had a drug problem, a convicted new york pimp bragged that he turned her out. %$* 195
and at 17 pornography was made of her by a man who had a prostitution conviction. %$* 195
the emperors club, where spitzer bought her, was run by pimps who charged a lot because they said it was high-class call girls. %$* 195
but it was the same as any other pimps, they took their 50 percent off the top. %$* 195
like a majority of johns, spitzer most likely enticed, coerced or persuaded her with money to put her life on the line by not using a condom. %$* 195
that’s not a freely made choice. %$* 195
women in prostitution face a statistical likelihood of weekly rape. %$* 195
a canadian woman in prostitution said, what’s rape for others is normal for us. %$* 195
a woman at a legal brothel in nevada said, it’s like you sign a contract to be raped. %$* 195
and in chicago, the same frequency of rape was reported by women in both escort and street prostitution. %$* 195
women in prostitution are seen as body parts or fake girlfriends and their feelings don’t matter, and they’re not seen as human which is perhaps why they’re murdered at a higher rate than any other group of women ever studied. %$* 195
the emotional consequences of prostitution are the same in widely varying cultures. %$* 195
whether it’s high-class or low-class. %$* 195
whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s in a brothel, strip club, massage parlor, or the street. %$* 195
symptoms of emotional distress in all forms of prostitution, are off the charts. %$* 195
depression, suicidality, post- traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, dissociation %$* 195
two thirds of the women we interviewed, and all of the people we interviewed in prostitution, two thirds of them had ptsd at the same level of the most emotionally traumatized groups ever studied by psychologists. %$* 195
that would be combat vets, women who had just been raped, women seeking shelter from batterers, and also state-sponsored torture survivors. %$* 195
what’s wrong with sex is what johns themselves tell us about it. %$* 195
for example, if you look at it, it’s paid rape. %$* 195
she has to do what you want. %$* 195
i use them like i might use any other amenity, a restaurant, or a public convenience. %$* 195
it’s like renting an organ for ten minutes. %$* 195
in research interviews with johns, we found that their abuse of women extended to women who had not been prostituted yet. %$* 195
the johns that bought the most women in prostitution were the most likely to commit sexually coercive acts with non-prostituting women. %$* 195
when women are turned into objects that men masturbate into, it causes immense psychological harm to the person acting as a receptacle. %$* 195
please don’t be fooled by people who tell buying sex is just another job. %$* 195
it’s wrong to set aside a special class of women, those who are the most vulnerable among us, for men’s sexual use. %$* 195
what’s wrong with paying for sex is it’s the business of sexual exploitation. %$* 195
thanks. %$* 195
we are halfway through our opening round. %$* 13
i'm john donvan, of abc news “nightline,” your moderator. %$* 13
we have heard from three debaters arguing this motion, “it’s wrong to pay for sex.” our next debater will rise now to argue against that motion. %$* 13
i would like to introduce tyler cowen, who is a professor of economics at george mason university, and director of the mercatus center, a think tank that uses economic tools to solve real world policy issues. %$* 13
and tyler, we heard wendy shalit talk about the hamburger defense, that this is not about buying hamburgers, that it’s different. %$* 13
i'm assuming as an economist you're going to step back a little bit from that argument. %$* 13
i introduce you once again to the audience, tyler cowen. %$* 13
this is a very serious matter, and to take it seriously, i propose we start by looking at human diversity. %$* 196
consider an example, you're a nineteen year old american soldier, and you’ve been drafted to fight the nazis in france, and you have, to put it bluntly, never done it before. %$* 196
and before the event of a big battle, you go and you buy sex from a frenchwoman who maybe needs the money to feed her kids. %$* 196
or maybe you're a young man and you have sexual problems, and you hire a sexual surrogate to help you with those problems, and you go on to have a loving and successful marriage. %$* 196
or maybe you're a handicap person who, for whatever reasons finds that a better way to achieve sexual ends is to pay for sex. %$* 196
these are all examples of the diversity of the human condition. %$* 196
what the other side is neglecting is this diversity, a diversity of individuals, a diversity of situations, a diversity of cultures. %$* 196
if you look at the broad sweep, the history of mankind, there’s a big, long book by nils ringdahl on the history of prostitution. %$* 196
he looks at medieval india, he looks at the tang dynasty, he looks at renaissance courtesans, and what you find is a wide variance of outcomes. %$* 196
you find a lot of cases where things go fine, and you find a lot of cases where things don’t go fine. %$* 196
i propose what we have here is a human activity which very frequently is badly regulated, and when it is badly regulated, you will see massive amounts of abuse, unfairness, exploitation. %$* 196
and i recognize the other side in pointing out these abuses. %$* 196
but the problem is that it is a badly regulated activity. %$* 196
there are many, many cases, three of which i’ve outlined, where consenting adults meet, they meet voluntarily, both of them are better off, and buying of the sex is not wrong. %$* 196
all of the abuses listed by the other side you can find in another institution called marriage. %$* 196
if you go around the world and go to poorer cultures and ask within marriage how often is there rape, how often is there abuse, exploitation, unequal terms all the way down the line, women who are too young to be married, you see this happen all the time. %$* 196
but to go back to our resolution, the correct answer is not to condemn marriage, to say that marriage is wrong. %$* 196
in a way you can think of prostitution as a bit like, dare i say, banking. %$* 196
as we know here in new york, banking is very frequently badly regulated. %$* 196
and you find in many countries, believe it or not right here in manhattan, you find examples of abuses, fraud, exploitation in banking. %$* 196
but again, the correct attitude or answer is not to say that all banking is wrong. %$* 196
there’s simply a category error being made by the other side in this debate. %$* 196
and again, think back to your core intuitions, there are many, many cases, millions, billions of cases in human history where informed, consenting adults have gotten together and someone has bought sex from another person. %$* 196
and again, i am submitting that these cases are not wrong. %$* 196
go take a look at new zealand, where prostitution is legal. %$* 196
it has been legal since 2003.the other side didn't mention new zealand at all. %$* 196
there’s a big long report written by the new zealand government about how this experiment has gone. %$* 196
uh, there’s a lot of evidence that it’s actually gone pretty well. %$* 196
a survey of the prostitutes revealed that seventy-three percent of them do it to pay household expenses, twenty-four percent of them are doing it to pay for education, thirty-eight percent are doing it to help out their children, or support an older family member, and the rates of abuse, coercion, and rape, the rate of rape is extremely low. %$* 196
it seems to be lower in prostitution than in a lot of other settings. %$* 196
but again, these are not the examples you're hearing. %$* 196
the point, again, that i'm stressing is this diversity, that when you have consenting adults there are, again, many cases where it’s simply possible that it is a okay thing to do. %$* 196
there are many other sectors of the economy that we can look at. %$* 196
if you ask the bureau of labor statistics, what is the most dangerous job in the united states, at least according to the bureau, it’s being a fisherman and going out on a fishing boat. %$* 196
it’s an extremely hazardous occupation. %$* 196
there’s a lot of loss of life, loss of limb, people being crippled, unfair conditions, illegal immigrants who work under conditions that are not right. %$* 196
and again, these are real problems. %$* 196
but to think of it in terms of morality, we ask, what is the moral issue here? %$* 196
the moral issue is when you have unsafe fishing boats, or when fishing is not regulated properly, or when we as society don’t think about fishing and industrial safety in all the right ways. %$* 196
no one thinks to say fishing is wrong, buying fish is wrong, fishing boats are wrong. %$* 196
again, it is simply this category error. %$* 196
i would even submit that if we take the point of view suggested by the opposition, the more we try to blackball, ban, condemn an activity that we all know has existed in every society, it always pops up, there is always a black market, there are many different ways of trading sex. %$* 196
it is not going away. %$* 196
if there’s one thing that we all should realize in this room, is that the buying of sex is not going away. %$* 196
what we want is that it happen in a better way rather than a worse way. %$* 196
we need to have a constructive attitude. %$* 196
i do not hear that constructive attitude from the other side. %$* 196
what i hear is an attitude that will put this practice under a greater veil of secrecy, it will make it harder for the people who are selling to go to the law when they have problems, it will make it more of a social disgrace, and it will worsen the problems with the working conditions rather than improve it. %$* 196
i’d also note, just as an aside, just how culturally-bound and institution specific the complaints are. %$* 196
for instance, in melissa farley’s presentation, it’s always man and woman, man buying from woman. %$* 196
there’s no talk of gay prostitution, there’s not much talk of the broader sweep of human history, of practices of dowries, of the numerous tribes in human history who have taken very different attitudes than that which we hold. %$* 196
in fact, if you polled the majority of human beings over time, the most likely answer you're going to hear is that the people who are doing something wrong are the men who are trying to get sex without paying for it simply by seducing the woman. %$* 196
anyway, thank you all. %$* 196
tyler cowen, with a very good sense of the clock. %$* 13
our next speaker is speaking for the motion that “it is wrong to pay for sex,” it’s interesting in the context of a debate, is actually somebody who has changed the terms of debate in this country in a way that has changed all of our lives, catharine mackinnon, a professor of law at the university of michigan, and also harvard, pioneered the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination. %$* 13
catharine also has been arguing on behalf of women raped in bosnia, making the argument that rape was a form of genocide. %$* 13
and catharine, the result of that trial? %$* 13
you won. %$* 13
we won seven hundred and forty-five million dollars in the southern district of new york before a jury like you. %$* 197
ladies and gentleman, catharine mackinnon. %$* 13
what i know about prostitution i know from the prostituted women that i work for, representing them because they asked me to. %$* 197
we have found the sanctimoniousness and the superiority of the moral position against prostituted people, that is that they are bad, to be insulting and insufferable. %$* 197
and we have also found the rescue impulse to be demeaning and typically ineffective. %$* 197
but, no one opposes the normal business of prostitution for money, that is of sex for money, more, or more eloquently than the women who really know what it is because they're living it. %$* 197
that is the women who are living in this industry, most of whom are trafficked by international definition, because they are being pimped. %$* 197
and they want to get out, and they can't. %$* 197
thus fitting the international definition of slavery. %$* 197
when you want to get out of marriage there’s a term called divorce. %$* 197
eighty-five percent of women, when asked what they most want, that is women in prostitution, say what they want is to get out, but they don’t know how to. %$* 197
usually they got in as children. %$* 197
normally they got in as children. %$* 197
the majority. %$* 197
they were, most of them, sexually abused, actually, even before that. %$* 197
this is in the ninety percent plus range. %$* 197
that is, they were treated as a thing for sex before they ever had a chance to become a person first. %$* 197
and usually they are women, meaning their economic options are limited already by sex discrimination, precluding a vast majority of what men do for better pay, leaving, for the women who end up in prostitution the one remaining thing to be called her choice. %$* 197
this is a myth that one woman described for herself as, to be able to get out i had to believe i chose to get in. %$* 197
sex, when it’s right, like friendship, is its own reward, it’s mutual, it’s equal in its diversity. %$* 197
you can't buy the real thing. %$* 197
in prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. %$* 197
the money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. %$* 197
it acts like physical force does in rape. %$* 197
and as kathleen barry put it, the only difference between rape and prostitution is time, one ends, the other doesn't. %$* 197
and then she is stigmatized and deprived of dignity by society, and criminalized by the legal system. %$* 197
so for her, what’s wrong with it is, it’s abusive, it’s intimately violative, it’s destructive, it’s damaging, it’s dangerous, it’s exploitative, and it’s unequal. %$* 197
it’s up to you to decide if this is right or wrong. %$* 197
we're not here, actually, to discuss the proposition “it’s wrong to be paid for sex.” we are here to discuss the proposition, “it is wrong to pay for sex.” i’ve just been talking about what’s wrong with it for her. %$* 197
what’s wrong with it for him is, he’s using her, he’s exploiting her, he’s exploiting his inequality to her, which is usually a desperate economic inequality. %$* 197
in order to have access to her person in a form of bodily invasion, while he gets off on the illusion that he has chosen this freely, when he is taking more than can ever be paid for. %$* 197
and what he is buying is not only that chunk of her humanity called self-respect %$* 197
and it isn't sex only, it’s you do what i say, sex. %$* 197
now, to be against this is why those of us who are today supporting this proposition support the swedish model. %$* 197
in this model, the seller is, well, the buyer is strongly criminalized. %$* 197
the seller has, is also strongly criminalized. %$* 197
in criminalizing the person who is the one who’s buying the sex, you are criminalizing the one that my desperately poor indian clients, from india, call the real criminal. %$* 197
and you de-criminalize the sold. %$* 197
you couple this with real education, real employment opportunities, real jobs, real money. %$* 197
women are entitled to real equality and real choices. %$* 197
men presumably also need to pay for household expenses to put themselves through school, and you don’t find them, in general, not in anything like the numbers you find women, selling themselves on street corners. %$* 197
women need real equality and real choices. %$* 197
we're asking you to vote yes for the proposition as a way to weigh in on the side of the view that women and children are not for sale. %$* 197
and i'm going to reserve the balance of my time for my rebuttal. %$* 197
we’ll remember that. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 13
and that concludes round one of the debate tonight. %$* 13
oh, i am so sorry, i skipped ahead on a card. %$* 13
i'm so glad that you're all here %$* 13
to keep me on the straight and narrow. %$* 13
i'm sorry, sydney. %$* 13
sydney biddle barrows is a successful businesswoman and consultant who is most known for her work running a prostitution ring called cache in the early 1980’s for about five years until her arrest. %$* 13
the tabloids were particularly drawn to the fact of your lineage, which you have captured in the title of the book you wrote about your experience as the mayflower madame. %$* 13
you had how many ancestors on the mayflower? %$* 13
both sides, two— %$* 198
both sides. %$* 13
okay, so you have puritans in your past. %$* 13
ladies and gentleman, arguing— %$* 13
they're all rolling over in their graves. %$* 198
arguing against the motion, sydney biddle barrows. %$* 13
thank you. %$* 198
freud once asked the question, what do women want? %$* 198
and i would argue that what women want is their own money. %$* 198
and i have heard a lot of stories about, some really horrifying stories about young girls, people being trafficked, as lionel said, this is just something, i mean i want them to throw away the key on these people. %$* 198
but what’s interesting is some of the statistics that i’ve been hearing, because what’s interesting is the only people that you can get these statistics from are the people at the very, very bottom, and they constitute a very small percentage of all of the working girls, at least in the united states. %$* 198
i cannot speak for anywhere else. %$* 198
and because i have to tell you that i don’t recognize any of the kinds of clients that the opposition has talked about, i don’t recognize any of the kinds of girls that the opposition has talked about, so let me tell you a little bit about the experiences that i had, and that because i know so many people all over the united states that run escort services, or that have worked as working girls. %$* 198
there’s tens of hundreds of thousands of them. %$* 198
and let me tell you a little bit about a story. %$* 198
first of all, who’s really taking advantage of who? %$* 198
i would argue that it is the women taking advantage of the men’s need for us. %$* 198
after all, who ends up with the money? %$* 198
we do. %$* 198
who’s the one who sets the price? %$* 198
we do. %$* 198
they're the ones who shell out because they want what we have. %$* 198
and if they don’t want to pay it, then they don’t get it. %$* 198
i mean, that's, it’s as simple as that. %$* 198
so, i just, and by the way, can i just say that building an ugly building affects millions of people over hundreds of years, so %$* 198
so i didn't feel bad %$* 198
but that was something just, she’s right, it absolutely offended me. %$* 198
i just, there’s some, a lot of ugly buildings out there. %$* 198
so let me tell you about some of the gals who worked for me, and who are fairly, this is the, first of all, most of them are students. %$* 198
i did not hire anyone under the age of nineteen, no one i know, and i know dozens and dozens of madames, ever hires girls under the age of eighteen. %$* 198
never. %$* 198
i only took forty percent of the young lady’s earnings, and they wanted to give that money to me. %$* 198
they didn't have to. %$* 198
but, i took the phone calls, i'm the one who set it up, i'm the one who checked them out, i'm the one who made sure they got the money if for some reason, you know, at the end of the evening he didn't pay, i would still pay her. %$* 198
and can i tell you something, in five and a half years, you should pardon the expression, we never once got stiffed. %$* 198
and we got %$* 198
and we got the money at the end. %$* 198
so you know, they use the word pimp, and i'm not saying that there aren't people out there that, that really fit that description, that aren't horrible people, but we’re not all like that. %$* 198
so, let me tell you about colby. %$* 198
colby was the daughter of a doctor, and she was used to living a very privileged life. %$* 198
she was in medical school, and she had several siblings who were either in college or medical school or law school or whatever. %$* 198
and colby had a thing for, you know, beautiful clothes, six hundred dollar boots is actually the example she gave to me. %$* 198
and she came to work for me because she felt guilty asking her father, who had so many other, you know, of her siblings in school, to give her six hundred dollars for a pair of boots. %$* 198
this was colby’s choice. %$* 198
but this is the reason she worked for me, so that she could have six hundred dollar boots. %$* 198
sandy was a singer in a rock and roll band, and she and her band had finally broken through and had gotten a, a tour put together. %$* 198
and about three months before they were supposed to go on tour someone broke into the van and stole all their equipment. %$* 198
this was their chance to really be someone and really make it, and so everyone went to work doing something else, and sandy came to work for me. %$* 198
you hear, and most of the girls, as i said before, were students. %$* 198
and the way i used to look at it is, here were the girls’ dreams on this side of the river. %$* 198
they wanted to be models, actresses, dancers, singers, they wanted a degree, they want, i had girls who wanted to be nurses, i had girls who wanted to be all different kinds of things. %$* 198
and, so this is their dream on this side of the gulch. %$* 198
and here they were over here, and they needed the money to pay the toll to the bridge to get to the other side so that they could have the life that they wanted. %$* 198
and they decided, and they could have done anything else, they decided that they wanted to do this. %$* 198
and it was their choice. %$* 198
and i know it’s going to, a lot of people are going to find this offensive, but i don’t think there’s one single solitary girl that worked for me who didn't come back after the very first time and say, i can't believe it was so easy. %$* 198
i can't believe i didn't do this before. %$* 198
i know, i know this is offensive to some people, but i mean, may a lightning bolt come down, this is what they said. %$* 198
and with respect to the guys, i mean, you should, we had terrific, we had a little saudi prince who %$* 198
who wanted to have pillow fights, because when he was a kid he never got to have pillow fights. %$* 198
we had workaholics who had no time for a personal life, especially back in the early eighties, we had currency traders who, you know, were awake at all different times. %$* 198
they didn't have time for a girlfriend. %$* 198
women weren't going to put up with guys who were never around. %$* 198
i mean, these were guys that women pay thousands of dollars to join these matchmaking services in order to meet. %$* 198
they were people who were between relationships, they wanted a sure thing. %$* 198
there were lonely travelers. %$* 198
there’s a lot of guys out there who were on the road, you know, week after week after week. %$* 198
they just want a little company. %$* 198
now, when you figure that, we euphemistically call it the nitty-gritty, only lasted maybe five, seven, eight minutes, and yet the clients kept the young ladies for one hour, two hour, three hours, four hours. %$* 198
what were they really paying for? %$* 198
if they, all they wanted was the sex, believe me, they could have gotten it for a hell of a lot less, we charged top dollar, that that’s not all that they pay for. %$* 198
a lot of them pay for the company, they pay because they just, they want a pretty girl to talk to and to have a good time with. %$* 198
i had a couple clients who had invalid wives who felt that it was cheating if they had a girlfriend, but they still had needs that they needed to have met. %$* 198
so, while it is true that there are a lot of bad people out there doing bad things to girls, i think to say that all of these girls are abused, that all of these girls are taken advantage of, that they're all traumatized, yes, there are some, but it’s certainly not the majority, and i, believe me, i want them to throw away the key on these people too. %$* 198
but, i think to tar everyone with the same brush is just not being realistic, because there are a lot of good people out there who are doing this. %$* 198
and to criminalize these girls, and to give them records so that they can't go and live a normal life just to me doesn't seem right. %$* 198
thank you, sydney biddle barrows. %$* 13
that concludes round one of our debate. %$* 13
i need to say that without you laughing at me for the radio broadcast, or you can just sit in silence, but i just need to say it without the laughter, because it would be impossible to explain to the audience, radio audience %$* 13
that concludes round one of our debate. %$* 13
you're, you're very kind. %$* 13
what had happened, i got distracted by the results from the initial vote, which i find quite surprisingly lopsided, but we will share them with you now. %$* 13
as things stand now, twenty percent of you are for the motion, fifty percent of you are against, and thirty percent of you are undecided. %$* 13
and recall that we will have you vote again towards the end, and we chose the winner depending on which side has moved the most votes. %$* 13
so we’re going to move now onto round two, and in round two the debaters speak directly to one another, and we also take questions from you. %$* 13
what will happen is, we have people in the audience who will come to you if you raise your hand. %$* 13
catch my attention, and i’ll signal a microphone to be brought over toward you. %$* 13
and when you take the microphone please hold it about a fist away from your mouth so that we can hear you in the hall, and also so that the radio recording can pick you up as well. %$* 13
but i want to kick off the questions first by turning to the panel and saying, after hearing the opening statements i feel as though i'm hearing two teams debate two entirely different worlds, one in which, in one world, in one of these worlds prostitutes are workers. %$* 13
in the other world, prostitutes are captives. %$* 13
in one world prostitutes have free choice, in another world prostitutes have no choice whatsoever. %$* 13
and i, especially given the description that you left us with, sydney, of you're talking about young women making choices, i want to ask anybody from the opposing side to address that point with sydney on the matter of choice. %$* 13
particularly catharine, you had said that there really is no free will, if you are a prostitute it is never your choice. %$* 13
i would like you to address that, or any of your teammates, to the other team. %$* 13
i didn't say what you just said. %$* 197
i said that it’s always in a context of sex inequality in which your options are precluded, to begin with, and as melissa pointed out, there’s a dramatic amount of racial and class based bias in the people who are actually in this industry. %$* 197
and you know, prostitution is what women do when all else fails, and all else fails often. %$* 197
and there are a lot of things that men do, in general, when all else fails, and prostitution is not that thing. %$* 197
and that means this is an institution of sex inequality. %$* 197
it is. %$* 197
and you know, when, but i would also note, that we actually agree with, that is, miss barrows and us concur in the view that the sold in this, the women, the girls, when they are boys or men, should not be criminals. %$* 197
they should be, the prostituted people need to be de-criminalized, firmly. %$* 197
that is the swedish model. %$* 197
and it’s the buyers who we’re here to talk about, the johns that melissa described. %$* 197
and whether, what it is, what it is they are doing when they are buying people. %$* 197
you're teammate, melissa farley. %$* 13
i would like to quote, to respond to what sydney said, and quote from her book, which is, she said, “a call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates sin.” i would use the word prostitution and not sin, so i would say a call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates prostitution. %$* 195
i think that’s the whole point we’re making here, that shouldn't be the choice. %$* 195
if we’re seeking an end to inequality between men and women, if we’re seeking an end to violence against men and women, women should not have to make the choice between poverty and education, paying the next month’s rent, and prostitution. %$* 195
from the other side, lionel tiger. %$* 13
i'm sorry that this whole discussion now is focused on prostitution. %$* 194
i thought that what we were talking about was the economics of human sexuality, and that is really the parsimonious fundamental issue that we have here. %$* 194
people engage, and i mention the engagement ring in marriages, which have immense responsibilities to the next generation, to communities, to relatives, to friends, and we’re somehow putting the immensely complex and, and both luxurious and difficult business of being an adult lover into the same rubric as prostitutes who, and i think there’s an argument to be made that it, yes it’s terrible, now we’re starting to hear how this all expresses sexual inequality and racial equality. %$* 194
please, let’s try to limit the discussion to the subject of human sexuality and stop including every single allergic category that comes into these discussions— %$* 194
when, when do— %$* 13
like reality, for example? %$* 197
when, what lionel is doing is saying that buying a diamond ring is paying for sex, and do— %$* 13
yeah, i think it’s actually the negative team that is equating, in equating marriage and dating with paying for sex. %$* 193
the negative team is conflating things that should not be conflated. %$* 193
first of all, in prostitution there’s no shared desire. %$* 193
right? %$* 193
which means one person is an object. %$* 193
that's a big difference. %$* 193
also, marriages in which there is a transactional element, in which it’s, okay, you give me this, i’ll give you this, there’s a fifty-fifty exchange of services, end up failing precisely because that’s not what a marriage is. %$* 193
right? %$* 193
but i want to address the free choice issue, because miss barrows says that she doesn't recognize any of the girls, or the men. %$* 193
so i just want to refresh her memory. %$* 193
because i thought her book was really interesting. %$* 193
and she said, quote, quite a few of the new girls that she used had no money and nothing appropriate to wear, so i would take them to saks and charge whatever they needed on my credit card. %$* 193
they would pay me back from their future earnings. %$* 193
when she found a fabulous ground floor apartment for her office, which was super cheap, the rate was made up for by making the girls sleep with the landlord, who she said was only interested in one thing, and lived in a seedy semi-furnished apartment and made them feel cheap. %$* 193
she says the girls weren't crazy about the plan, and really one can see why. %$* 193
is that free choice? %$* 193
that doesn't sound like empowerment to me. %$* 193
to me empowerment comes from actualizing your unique potential in the world. %$* 193
that’s what empowerment is. %$* 193
realizing you're unique, and you have a unique contribution to make to this world, not being forced to sleep with a landlord to enrich somebody else’s pockets. %$* 193
i'm sorry. %$* 193
tyler cowen, you want to come back to that. %$* 13
our moderator is a very objective fellow, and what he’s pointed out is that there are many different worlds here. %$* 196
and this is true. %$* 196
and what i would like you to do is to think through the implications of there being many different worlds. %$* 196
the other side is asking for a blanket condemnation of a practice. %$* 196
i'm asking you to see many different worlds, to understand this diversity of human preference, experience, and culture. %$* 196
and once we view the debate in this terms, in my view, the correct answer is to side with us, that there is no blanket condemnation, it is a diverse set of situations with many entirely acceptable outcomes, a lot of very bad outcomes, and the other side is simply pressing the emotional buttons again and again and again on the bad outcomes, and trying to press all of our buttons. %$* 196

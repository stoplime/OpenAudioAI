and one other thing, you asked about getting rid of sports? %$* 308
i'll tell you why it wouldn't be a bad idea, because then, that's actually the best argument for keeping football, you keep football, you keep basketball, you get rid of all the other sports that they pay for so that money at least goes into the general fund so the average student is getting something out of it. %$* 308
do you want to add something? %$* 13
because he had a long run. %$* 13
well, i mean, that's another debate, whether-- %$* 310
tim green. %$* 13
we want to ban all non-revenue producing sports. %$* 310
again, those are-- %$* 310
create opportunities for people, and for men, and for women, and i think universities are about opportunities. %$* 310
and the other thing, i just want to say this because you mentioned something that's absolutely wonderful, buzz, before every football game and before every athletic contest at the high school level and in the college level, everyone, everyone, both sides, we stand up and-- %$* 310
if we don't sing, at least we stand and respectfully observe the star spangled banner, this country's song. %$* 310
and, you know, our national anthem, what a beautiful thing, that's the only place where a community, where an entire school comes together and stands up and respects the national anthem. %$* 310
you don't do it anywhere else in the college experience. %$* 310
malcolm's not singing it, though. %$* 13
sir, question. %$* 13
actually, mr. %$* 18
bissinger, i did go to the university of chicago and i did play football there. %$* 18
they reinstituted football in 1969-- %$* 18
but on a very, very minor, minor scale. %$* 308
yes, so it's division 3. %$* 18
but they wear a helmet and hit each other. %$* 18
and, mr. %$* 18
whitlock, i do work on wall street as well, so actually i think i had some success in my career after graduating from the university of chicago. %$* 18
i can tell you this much, the university of chicago athletes in general, not just football but athletes overall, have a higher gpa when i graduated in 2000 than the overall student body. %$* 18
so your question, the argument of athletics in education, there is a correlation of your education-- %$* 18
so the question is this, now, it is also true that division 1 programs without football, no one makes money. %$* 18
football programs pay for all the other sports. %$* 18
so once you ban football, how do you pay for women's swimming, how do you pay for every other sport there is because there is a correlation between athletics and academics. %$* 18
how do you pay for women's swimming? %$* 308
the way you pay for a lot of things. %$* 308
taxes? %$* 18
no, you get a rich benefactor, and there are plenty out there who will pay for the program because frankly that's what's happening now. %$* 308
the next phase of college football will be boone pickens. %$* 308
why is oklahoma state so good? %$* 308
because he's given $300 million to the football program. %$* 308
the university of oregon, it came out of nowhere to be a football power. %$* 308
why? %$* 308
because of the hundreds of millions given by phil knight. %$* 308
if you want to have women's swimming, you have a benefactor pay for it. %$* 308
and you know as well as i do that chicago is in a very, very different place than the 125 bcs schools. %$* 308
there is no question that places like chicago and harvard and wesleyan where kids don't think that they're going to be pro football players, the most formidable person i have ever met is an athlete because they don't quit. %$* 308
but you know what the problem with athletes are? %$* 308
you know where they do the best? %$* 308
wall street. %$* 308
and you know why wall street is so screwed up? %$* 308
it’s because athletes-- %$* 308
all right. %$* 13
it's true, athletes don't know when to quit. %$* 308
they're only about winning. %$* 308
one of the greatest american philosophers, john dewey, wrote a book called, "democracy in education," and he discusses the importance of sport in play in the-- %$* 19
both k through 12 education as well as the system of american higher education. %$* 19
and i'm wondering what the side for banning college football would think john dewey would think of the idea of taking sport in play out of the curriculum of american higher education when it actually is a really important part of the higher education of an individual, whether it's intramural sports or-- %$* 19
i don't know what the level of college sports is, but-- %$* 19
okay. %$* 13
we're not talking about taking sports out of the curriculum. %$* 309
we're talking about banning semi professional-- %$* 309
or-- %$* 309
buzz might have a slightly different interpretation of this than me-- %$* 309
but i think that if you look at schools like for example mit, which has one of the highest participation rates in intramural sports in the country, their level of play is far higher than everybody else's, perhaps as a consequence of the fact that they’ve turned their backs on big time college sports. %$* 309
so i think you could-- %$* 309
if we focused on precisely what john dewey was interested in doing, which is bringing sports down to the level of the average-- %$* 309
the ordinary student, then that would be more easily achieved if we got away from this preoccupation with these enormously costly and dangerous spectacles. %$* 309
and just to clarify, i mean, you could have-- %$* 308
people might not like it-- %$* 308
you could have wonderful club sports that could be very, very competitive. %$* 308
i mean, you can have a schedule. %$* 308
the amount of travel the teams do is ridiculous. %$* 308
you can have a schedule where you’re competing against regional teams. %$* 308
i think john dewey was talking about the development of the whole individual. %$* 308
the fact is, there’s no phys-ed anymore in schools. %$* 308
everything is about and by and for the athlete. %$* 308
and what happens is you create the athletic culture. %$* 308
let me put to the other side. %$* 13
so the solution of having club sports as opposed to sports at the level that you guys played, what would that do? %$* 13
you’re limiting access for a lot of people, so-- %$* 311
you’re not going to have college scholarships for the athletes. %$* 310
and, i mean, one thing i do want to say, though, is almost this line. %$* 310
i mean, are we talking about banning college football or are we talking about only banning college football if it’s division 1 college football? %$* 310
are we talking about division 3, division 2 football? %$* 310
that’s okay? %$* 310
but division 1-- %$* 310
no, because, i mean, i-- %$* 308
no? %$* 310
you know, i think the model of division 2 and division 3 is better. %$* 308
i think if you read william bowen’s book, i think it’s called “game of play,” it’s a fantastic book based on data that he got from the ivy league and from duke. %$* 308
i mean, the one thing he did point out, and the little three, he said, “it’s a total fallacy to think that the ivy league does not recruit and does not play games with scholarships and that williams actually gives more athletic preference to athletes than the university of michigan.” i think all these programs are loss leaders and, you know, look-- %$* 308
you’re saying ban college football-- %$* 310
i’m advocating-- %$* 308
here’s what i’m-- %$* 308
entirely? %$* 310
no, but i’m advocating that there are other ways to do it. %$* 308
whether it’s a minor league season, whether it’s an nfl developmental system, why not the european model? %$* 308
the european model. %$* 308
they don’t use their colleges and universities to create soccer players. %$* 308
they have sports academies, they have schools. %$* 308
they’ve plucked players as young as six because they say, “all right, you want to be a soccer player, you’re showing talent,” and they go to school there. %$* 308
and the other thing they do that is smart and beneficial is if you’re not going to make it, you’re weeded out early so you learn-- %$* 308
all right. %$* 13
buzz-- %$* 13
at an early age-- %$* 308
because of time-- %$* 13
all right, sorry. %$* 308
only because of time, i want to give you 15 seconds to respond if you want to. %$* 13
so we’re not going to ban college football, we’re just going to change it? %$* 310
because we’re going to have colleges that have football teams and some of those players, the players who want, get to go and get their education so they still have-- %$* 310
no, i think we ban college football and then you have a developmental system for those who are-- %$* 308
that are-- %$* 310
at the higher echelons of competition. %$* 308
and for the rest of the schools-- %$* 308
that are called syracuse university, texas longhorns-- %$* 310
yeah, you-- %$* 308
oklahoma sooners? %$* 310
i mean, you license it out. %$* 308
okay. %$* 310
you license it out. %$* 308
as long as they can go to school and so those 70 percent that want to get their education can get it, i think it’s great. %$* 310
yeah, that %$* 308
all right, that concludes round two of this intelligence squared us debate. %$* 13
and remember how you voted at the beginning of the debate. %$* 13
we’re going to ask you to vote again in just a few minutes after the closing statements, which will come immediately and be briefly. %$* 13
round three, closing statements. %$* 13
two minutes each, uninterrupted. %$* 13
our motion is ban college football, and here to summarize his position against the motion, tim green, a bestselling author, former atlanta falcon, and college football hall of famer. %$* 13
there is no question that there are problems with college football, as there are problems with almost every institution in this country. %$* 310
but i hope that, after some of the things you’ve heard tonight from jason and from me, people who’ve benefited from the education of college-- %$* 310
the education we had on the football field with the perseverance, the hard work, the teamwork, the tolerance, and the benefits that accrued to us through our education, where we earned the opportunity to get college degrees, where-- %$* 310
and sometimes some of the people who get those degrees wouldn’t have another way to get them except through football scholarships. %$* 310
so there are great things. %$* 310
they unify our communities in many instances. %$* 310
they unify campuses and colleges, and the reason why it’s there is because it is doing good things and yes it’s making money and yes the coaches are making money and this is america. %$* 310
it’s capitalism, i’m sorry. %$* 310
brad pitt makes $25 million to make a movie. %$* 310
that’s just our-- %$* 310
that’s our society. %$* 310
so we pay people what the market says we should pay them. %$* 310
football, there are concussions, but there are no studies so far that link that to anything other than some isolated instances. %$* 310
so football-- %$* 310
and it's evolving. %$* 310
with the equipment and the rules, it can continue to get better. %$* 310
but to end it, to me-- %$* 310
malcolm gladwell may be best known for his book called" blink." and in that book, it says that when you're faced with a crucial decision or any decision, just listen to the premise and then give your immediate impression. %$* 310
so that's what i want to ask you to do tonight. %$* 310
think about this. %$* 310
think about, are we going to ban college football, and in a blink, i think you'll vote that we will not. %$* 310
thank you, tim green. %$* 13
our motion is "ban college football." here to summarize his position in support of the motion, buzz bissinger, a pulitzer price-winning journalist, sports columnist for "the daily beast" and author of "friday night lights." %$* 13
look, there's no question, this is a radical solution. %$* 308
but i think it is called for in what are radical times. %$* 308
i am surprised that tim and jason seem not to be affected at all about our lagging academic performance, that we're now 14th in the world in math and reading and science when we used to be first, that we're 16th in educational attainment, meaning that other countries are catching up and catching up rapidly and exceeding us when we used to be first. %$* 308
we simply do not have time to waste. %$* 308
universities were set up for a primary academic purpose. %$* 308
they were not set up as sports factories disguised as universities. %$* 308
and i understand the graduation rate is 69 percent. %$* 308
i think it's ginned up. %$* 308
i think a lot of players, and i think even tim would-- %$* 308
he'll admit this to me privately afterwards-- %$* 308
a lot of players are pushed through and passed through with no demands placed upon him. %$* 308
and i know the impact. %$* 308
i did write a book called "friday night lights" in which the cornerstone character was a black running back named boobie miles. %$* 308
now, this was high school. %$* 308
and i saw what happened as many college players are when you are treated as a football animal, when you pass-- %$* 308
because the word on the street is-- %$* 308
with the professors is, "you better pass that kid or there's going to be trouble." boobie miles got no education. %$* 308
he was a football animal. %$* 308
he was considered dysfunctional, basically an idiot, which he was not. %$* 308
and i'll tell you, with no education, his life has been nothing, nothing but a horrendous hell and a lot of broken dreams that football propagates more than any other sport. %$* 308
thank you, buzz bissinger. %$* 13
"ban college football," that is our motion. %$* 13
here to argue his position against this motion, jason whitlock is a national columnist for foxsports.com and an all sports insider and contributor to fox sports radio. %$* 13
i want to start where i began by-- %$* 311
mr. %$* 311
gladwell, mr. %$* 311
bissinger, malcolm, buzz, two of the brightest minds i have ever encountered. %$* 311
and i-- %$* 311
when i said that comment about them dabbling in sports, it's because most of the time they apply their mind to much bigger issues than sports. %$* 311
and so it's been a worthy debate. %$* 311
mr. %$* 311
gladwell began talking about the purpose of schools. %$* 311
and overall education is about preparing you for life. %$* 311
and i think if they had a bit more experience with college football, actual participation, and then i don't mean that in any kind of dismissive way. %$* 311
but it's something you have to experience, because i don't think most people understand the educational benefits of college football. %$* 311
and it's dismissed as a bunch of dummies. %$* 311
brady hoke, the head football coach at the university of michigan is a very good friend of mine. %$* 311
he played football at ball state university. %$* 311
he had been the head coach of ball state university. %$* 311
i have watched him up close and personal in this era reach kids at ball state university and san diego state university and now at the university of michigan, with an entire leadership program and men-building program that he and his strength coach implement throughout a player's four and-five-year career. %$* 311
and it helps develop the overall person. %$* 311
and it helps prepare the athlete for life in the real world. %$* 311
that is a school's purpose. %$* 311
if we truly understood football and what was transpiring, i don't think anyone would argue that it's not part of the academic experience. %$* 311
it may be part of the academic experience that some people don't respect because they don't understand it, but trust me, it is a big part of the academic experience. %$* 311
it's not perfect. %$* 311
it can be improved. %$* 311
it can be more like the ivy league system. %$* 311
but there's no way we should ban football. %$* 311
thank you, jason whitlock. %$* 13
our motion is "ban college football." and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, malcolm gladwell, a new yorker staff writer and author of "the tipping point." %$* 13
the most surprising thing about this debate to me at the send that we only mentioned the name junior seau twice. %$* 309
and to my mind, junior seau's shadow is cast over this whole evening. %$* 309
last week he shot himself in the chest. %$* 309
and he played four years at the university of southern california, over which i'm guessing he was hit in the head about 4,000 times. %$* 309
he's not the first. %$* 309
before junior seau, there was dave duerson, played four years at the university of notre dame, during which time he was probably hit in the head around 4,000 times. %$* 309
he wasn't the first, either. %$* 309
before him, there was andre waters. %$* 309
shot himself in the head. %$* 309
played four years at cheyney university over which time he was probably hit in the time at least 4,000 times. %$* 309
i could go on and on and on right down to the captain of the penn football team who hung himself in his room a couple years ago. %$* 309
someone did an autopsy on his brain. %$* 309
what did they find? %$* 309
they found evidence of long-term neurological damage that was the result of being hit in the head too many times. %$* 309
now, i have sat, and i have listened to some-- %$* 309
some of the things that the other side has said have been extraordinarily eloquent. %$* 309
i think some of the things that both tim and jason said about what this game can do are absolutely true. %$* 309
it is, in many ways, a beautiful game. %$* 309
it's a game that teaches all kinds of powerful and fundamental lessons. %$* 309
it's a game that's a central part of our culture. %$* 309
but at a certain time, i think this debate comes down to one thing, and that is you have to look at the collateral damage this game has left in its wake. %$* 309
and you have to ask the question, is it time to say, enough? %$* 309
thank you, malcolm gladwell. %$* 13
and that concludes our closing statements. %$* 13
and now it's time to see which side you feel has made the best argument here. %$* 13
we want to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat to register your vote. %$* 13
this will be your second vote. %$* 13
our motion is, "ban college football." if you feel that this team presented the stronger argument, press number one. %$* 13
if it's this team, number two. %$* 13
decide against. %$* 13
if you are undecided or became undecided, push number three. %$* 13
and you can ignore the other keys. %$* 13
and if you press anything by mistake, just correct yourself, and system will lock in your last vote. %$* 13
so we'll have those results in about 140 seconds from now. %$* 13
and while we're waiting for the votes, i just want to ask-- %$* 13
this debate was actually one of our best ever. %$* 13
and part of it was because they really heard each other. %$* 13
they didn't agree, but they listened to each other. %$* 13
and that made it a far more interesting debate. %$* 13
i just want to thank them and a round of applause for both also just a little secret. %$* 13
there was a wager placed in the back room before the debate began. %$* 13
everybody-- %$* 13
these four guys put up 20 bucks each. %$* 13
so there is a $40 cash prize in it for whoever-- %$* 13
whoever wins this thing. %$* 13
we want to thank our media partners slate, especially jacob weisberg and his exceptional editorial staff. %$* 13
they've been with us all season. %$* 13
and this is our last debate here at the skirball center at nyu. %$* 13
it's been our venue since the fall of 2009.thank you to the staff and crew for six great seasons here. %$* 13
we really appreciate it. %$* 13
and i have a very, very short side competition. %$* 13
i'm going to ask a question. %$* 13
the first person in the audience who can answer this question correctly, you'll have about 15 seconds, will get two free tickets to the first debate in our next season. %$* 13
and the question is this. %$* 13
it's football related. %$* 13
"what does the heisman trophy have to do with the man named ed smith, and who was he? %$* 13
" you got it? %$* 13
yes. %$* 13
he was a football player and-- %$* 13
sorry? %$* 13
the model for the heisman trophy was an nyu football player. %$* 13
class of 1936. this fall we are moving up-- %$* 13
congratulations-- %$* 13
this fall we are moving uptown to the kaufman center. %$* 13
that's on west 67th street between broadway and amsterdam avenue, and dates are set, and tickets are already on sale. %$* 13
we're going to be following the presidential election particularly closely this fall, and that means we're going to be doing topics like, "super pacs," and "health care," and "taxing the wealthy." the motions and debaters will be announced this summer. %$* 13
one other thing, we are very, very delighted to announce a new partnership. %$* 13
it is with the richard paul richmond center for business law and public policy that's a joint venture of the columbia business school and the columbia law school. %$* 13
the richmond center is going to co-sponsor two debates during the fall 2012 and spring 2013 season, beginning with an october 24 debate on domestic tax policy that will be featuring glen hubbard, who is dean of columbia business school. %$* 13
glen hubbard previously served as deputy assistant secretary at the u.s.department of the treasury and as chairman of the council of economic advisors. %$* 13
and, once again, we are partnering this evening with new american tavern around the corner to host a post debate reception at amity hall. %$* 13
that's the locale around the corner, a block away on 3rd street, between thompson and sullivan. %$* 13
details for that location are in your program, but it's just really literally on the other side of this building. %$* 13
and there you can continue this debate with your fellow audience members over complementary appetizers and discounted drinks. %$* 13
and i'll be there along with some of the other members of our staff for a little bit. %$* 13
we did it last time, and it was great. %$* 13
people just wanted to keep debating the issue with each other. %$* 13
so we hope that we'll see you there. %$* 13
so that's it. %$* 13
i'm just waiting for the results to come. %$* 13
and here they come, for the $40 cash prize, glory. %$* 13
all right. %$* 13
it's all-- %$* 13
and you have heard all of the arguments, two teams of two, trying to change your minds throughout this debate, "ban college football." that is our motion, ban it or not. %$* 13
here are the results. %$* 13
before the debate, 16 percent were for the motion, 53 percent were against, 31 percent were undecided. %$* 13
after the debate, 53 percent are for the motion, that's up 37 percent-- %$* 13
39 percent are against, that's down 14 percent, 8 percent are undecided. %$* 13
the side arguing for the motion carries the debate. %$* 13
our congratulations to them. %$* 13
thank you from me, john donvan, and intelligence squared u.s. we'll see you next time. %$* 13
